Since I got it free from the public library, and time was my only investment, I'm not sorry at all. Roughly 50% of IMDb votes are 1 which is totally absurd. A more accurate rating is probably in the 4 to 6 range, compared to all similar films. Center Stage, where the central characters are dancers training to make it big in ballet, is a similar film.Other commentors say Britney Spears can't sing. Those comments are equally absurd. While I'm not particularly a fan of hers, she indeed can sing, very well. As a singer she is as good as most of the rest of the young singers who cater to the teeniebopper audience. She certainly is a better singer than Madonna who achieved her fame on image alone.Can Britney act? Compared to good young actresses, Britney is fairly amateurish. But she didn't have to stretch very far for the role of a proper, studious high school valedictorian who decided to look for her mother who abandoned her as a baby to be raised by her single father (Ackroyd). And, along the way write poetry which was then put to music by a young man who drove the three girls west to Los Angeles.Most of the situations and dialog are silly, and there are many close-range shots of a pretty, smiling Britney. However I suspect they would appeal to the under-15 crowd of Britney fans. I enjoyed the film from the point of view that it gave me some glimpse of the real Britney, one that is not revealed in her concerts and music videos. I believe, as she grows up and out of her former image, she will develop a more mature singing and acting style and will continue her popularity for a long time. (Year 2005 update I was wrong, she's become very strange! Year 2007 update She has gotten even more strange! Year 2008 update Even her little sister has become strange, and a new mother!!))Critic Ebert gives an accurate review of the facts in the case, I will not repeat them here. While I probably would not recommend this film to anyone, I personally enjoyed watching it. Not a very good film, still it also is not a bad film. Just juvenile.

The only people who may possibly like it are those people who think that Britney's music is brilliant.  And even those people can't deny that Britney can't act.  This movie lacked everything.  When you read the plot, it looks as though it could have some meaning to it, maybe even a little more than some other teen movies.  But it isn't so.  And it's so silly, like Britney's character writing that poem that turns out to be the lyrics to that stupid, ' not a girl, not yet a woman', whatever it is.  And then the guy writes music for it and she automatically starts singing along perfectly, she automatically knows the tune even though she hasn't heard it yet, and so forth.  And don't even get me started on the karaoke contest scene, the cover of I love rock 'n roll is a travesty.  This is another pitiful pop star attempt at being a movie star.  Doesn't work at all.

Sob, sob! Incredibly awful and idiotic drama coupled with sickeningly sweet romance make this one a not-to-be-missed...if you're the sort to love MST3K, that is. Sure, Britney can't act too well, but she can sing, and this movie is actually a LOT better than Glitter, Mariah Carey's similarly-themed vehicle. (And by better, I mean less boring and self-indulgent.) It's been two years since I saw Crossroads and I still remember it vividly.

Taryn Manning did OK, but the rest... it was just not impressive at any point. And I think everyone was trying to make Britney look better than she really was, complimenting her. Her character, Lucy, is too flawless. She was always perfect while the people who surrounded her had prominent flaws.

And I know you've got to see it for what it is, you don't go to see Crossroads if you are looking for a deep film, but even as a cute chick flick Crossroads didn't do very well. at all. It was shallow pretending to be genuine and deep. Even in the worst of girl films you need a point where it's getting serious - something to make it look real, you need to feel something.This whole movie is too SWEET.

Madonna did it, Justin Guarinni did it, Kelly Clarkson did it, and most famously, Jennifer Lopez did it. In 2002, Britney Spears became yet another unfortunate statistic to the sad and growing tally of can't-act singers. Mauled by critics, Crossroads became a box office disappointment, and finally showed the world that an Oscar is nowhere in the near future for Mrs. Spears.Crossroads is definitely a stinker. The plot is so indescribably simplistic that a 6yr old could follow it. The element of Britney's character finding and confronting her AWOL mother is disastrously underdone. At other times, the acting is downright ridiculous and has some of the most uninspired direction I've ever seen (closeup, medium shot, closeup, medium shot, repeat 500 times). Judging from the lead actress, Crossroads is a film aimed at the preteen crowd so naturally it should have content which is suitable for that age group. So you can imagine how shocked I was at the whole plot line of Lucy trying to loose her virginity to some loser, the saga of her friend being raped by her other friend's fianc√©, who gets pregnant, and then has a miscarriage by taking a header down a flight of stairs! Yes, this is all in the movie, folks!However, those saying it's the worst film of all time have really got to see more movies. This is because Crossroads is mildly amusing to follow despite it's Goliath sized flaws. I do admit I have a soft spot for the road trip genre, and the quirkiness of several characters and their offbeat adventures kept me somewhat entertained in a vanilla state. But despite this, Crossroads is not worth the DVD price. You're much better off using that money to see a better film currently in theatres.So next time you visit your local video rental place, I advise you skip this one. It's simple, and poorly made so it's really not worth your time. If it happens to be on cable, you might be amused but I'm sure you'll find yourself changing the channel not long after it starts. 4/10 "},{"Title":"It needs to be slapped - hard!","Date":"27 March 2003","Score":"82 out of 155 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Music","Review":"  This movie is a prime example of BAD movies.

For the first forty minutes it was a warm, if slightly generic, road movie about the positives of friendship and following your dreams... Then, after that point, I started to feel it turn into a Steel Magnolias clone. It was now apparently the type of film where the girls all sit around in a sewing circle, and discuss their problems. I suppose this is fine if you feel like these are real issues and you can relate to them, but when they feel as though they've been cribbed from the pages of 'Dear Abby... ', you stop suspending your disbelief that these are real people, and start seeing them for what they are Stock Movie Characters.Going along with the well-worn movie tradition, the guy our heroine gets with has to be 'hot', and not the slightly awkward, geeky schoolfriend that she actually shares a little bit of a rapport with. That's Movie Law - don't lose your virginity to someone you have a little bit of history with, lose it instead to the hunk you've only just met who has a heartbreaking backstory and abs chiseled from stone, but lacks the facility of meaningful conversation. Hey, why talk much when you can just beat up sleazy jerks in bars and win the girl's affection that way, right?!The first half of the film actually has a path that seems like it might be leading somewhere... until suddenly, that trail goes cold, and the rest of the movie is essentially just a visually 'inspirational' pep talk for Spears' status as a teen role model. It's a shame too, because Spears' performance as a whole suggests she would be capable of handling more diverse requirements. Sadly, these don't appear to be in the play- by-play manual followed by the makers. Eventually, the clich√©s win out, as we all must have suspected they would do, in the first place.

I knew the plot would be predictable and lack credibility - i mean come on! It's a Britney movie! But some of my favourite films lack credibility and are still hugely enjoyable, just as a silly release from daily life.Britney tries hard to reclaim her image as the innocent virgin, which has already been destroyed, and making herself out to be clever, or even a geek?

But really, in all honesty, she is far from the worse thing about this movie. It's true that she is obviously no actress but I didn't exactly hated her watching in this and her performance didn't made me cringe all that badly.It's a movie that got made at the prime of her musical career, when she also was still considered to be fresh and innocent. But it does not at all feel like this movie got specifically written for her. She plays a character that is quite different from herself and in the movie she doesn't even sing or dances all that much, which is good news for a lot of people. It's true that this movie is a typical chick-flick, so perhaps I'm not the right person to judge it but I'm still sure that I'm very well able to recognize a good movie when I see it and this movie just isn't much good to watch. The entire way the movie got written and progresses is not only boring and pointless but also lazy and too often doesn't make enough sense.I just don't get some of the stuff that this movie does. Britney Spears is supposed to be an ugly girl, that gets laughed at, at school, which is laughable in itself. No matter how much you just don't like Britney, you can't really call her ugly, especially not when you also see her body as well, which she shows quite a lot in this movie actually. And for some crazy and never explained reason, 3 girls who used to be best friends stopped being friends at high school and even somewhat hate each other go on a road trip together and for some, totally different, crazy reason they also suddenly are friends again, as if everything that was shown and told in the movie previously wasn't important and had even never happened.Something I also really don't understand; the Britney Spears character had a nerdy boyfriend (played by Justin Long of course) for 3 years but as the movie goes along she totally forgets about this and so are its viewers supposed to do I suppose? Since she hooks up with a totally different guy, which is something we also are supposed to cheer for. But what about poor Justin Long Brit? What did he ever do wrong to you. It just didn't feel right but it's normal for this movie to leave many loose ends like this and character just keep on changing their behavior and personalities for no logical reasons, other than it's just being a very poorly written movie.The movie really doesn't progress very naturally or pleasantly and doesn't really wrap things up properly. Just think about it. The 3 main characters all go on the road trip for a specific reason but for none of them, it ends up the way they were hoping for. The movie acts as if it has an happy ending but once you really start thinking about it, you could wonder to yourself, what exactly is so happy about it.It's actually amazing to see how many big names appear in this movie. Granted, that most of them weren't really big names yet at the time, such as Zoe Saldana and Justin Long but still it makes you wonder how so many great actors ended up playing in this movie. It's probably all due to it that this was a Britney Spears vehicle and lots of people tried to ride in on the success and fame of her. But as it turned out, this is not exactly a project that any of the people involved with could be very proud of.Not exactly the worst movies of all time, not even close honestly but it still is far from a great or likable enough movie as well.4/10 http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"She's a Woman, Not Yet an Actress","Date":"30 May 2011","Score":"7 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Music","Review":" Three small-town Georgia girls bury a memory box, pledging to open it together when they are high school graduates.

You see, I am a bad movie nut--and I love laughing at the worst stuff Hollywood has to offer. And, based on what I'd heard about this film, I assumed it was simply dreadful...painfully dreadful, in fact. However, while I'd never in the least say it was a good film, it wasn't that bad--and one of the brightest aspects of the film was actually Britney Spears, as she COULD act and was very effective in her role--even though it, like the others, was poorly written. And this is THE reason I'd say this isn't a very good film. While the acting and direction are pretty good, the script is like a string of clich√©s all strung together and it's pure formula--with very, very few surprises (other than Spears' strong acting).The film is a coming of age/road movie involving three young ladies who are mostly stereotypes and not real people. Britney plays an overachiever whose father plans on her going to medical school (Britney...in medical school?!). Her other two friends are the stuck-up Black girl...with sass and attitude, as well as a more tom-boyish girl. All three characters do improve and show SOME life through the course of the film, but especially at the beginning they are like caricatures--not people you could suspect are real in any way...at least not on this planet.But, despite the awful writing and music video-like qualities of the film, the overall concoction is pretty painless for what it is and isn't totally bad--hence my disappointment. I also should point out that although Miss Spears' target audience is the 10-15 year-old age group, the film is NOT family-friendly in its dealing with sex. While some of the messages about sexuality are good and informative (such as date rape--though they sure made this plot point a tiny bit too vague), the rest seem to say well, if you know a guy, like, for a week or so,...um, yeah, like...you should do 'it'....for sure.

I also didn't have any major expectations going into the film - judging by her hopping around, which was called dancing, with her early hits, I figured her acting would be equally interesting.I'm not surprised that she wanted to act, or that people were willing to pay to see her in her first attempt and went away disappointed that her skills weren't up to par yet. Although what par is for pop musicians who try to become omni-media stars is unclear to me. Shanghai Surprise certainly set a rather low standard. I do think Britney can sing, and sings better than me, although that's faint praise. She doesn't sing songs that I always like, but she's got a nice voice. I'm thankful she did this, instead of some sort of Britney Revealed backstage movie filled with endless applications of mascara and I mean, we're fricking dorks! I don't think I could have endured that, or my nieces' endless demands to see it.I do wish the plot didn't involve Britney trying to become a singer while facing the incredible challenges of growing up (are the movie executives teenagers? How many times have we seen this plot? After the first five minutes, I could have summarized the entire movie in a three-minute voice mail and spared all of silicon valley from having to see this movie) which is, shall we tactfully say, a bit trite, for all of Britney's PR people saying it's so relevant.I'd expect to see this show up on the lifetime (victim) network at some point - the story seemed about that caliber of movie. I'm not sure there was anyone with actual quality experience in major movie making behind the wheel. The writing was terrible. Dan Ackroyd looks like he was sleepwalking in order to get through the experience. But Kim Cattrall was interesting as a bad mom (never pictured her in that role. The mom, I mean). Britney and friends were all appealing and the camera predictably loved all of them. I wish my parents spent that much on MY teeth.Acting lessons, like ballet lessons, should never end. I didn't think this wasn't a movie to completely trash - it just got too much buzz so it fell a bit hard. I'm sure Britney could use some peace right now. If she was listening to anyone, which I doubt, maybe she would take a few acting lessons, record an album of baby lullabies, and hire an image consultant before her next acting effort - she definitely could do much better than this.

We all knew what was going to happen next.Britney, I mean Lucy, and her friends embark on a road trip to Los Angeles, each with their own reasons.With the exception of Justin Long, who we would later see as the Apple Mac guy picking on PC, there's nothing to this movie except seeing Spears and fellow actors destroy songs by Joan Jett and Shania Twain among others. Lucy's friends seemingly exist to meet some kind of tragedy once they reach LA. Spears does too, however she wants to take out whoever's brave enough to try this film, forcing me to fast-forward through her rendition of American Idol. I'm reminded of a scene in the Simpsons, where Mr. Burns forces Santa's Little Helper to watch visions of horror, ala Clockwork Orange.

It was obvious that our three leads, Spears, Saldana, and Manning, were quickly becoming strong friends &#150; and that friendship translated well onto the screen, but it was their individual stories and accomplishments that created the pain. In one scene, we saw this trio as little girls &#150; friends without a care in the world &#150; then instantly we are pushed into the awkward high school dark ages where nobody is friends with anyone. Riffs have been issued, and we are asked to rediscover who these characters are again. Matching them with their young counterparts is easy, but when their mouths open, it is another world all together. Spears leads with a hodgepodge of different characteristics. She dances sensually in her bedroom, unrobes nonchalantly in front of her lab partner, but is most avid about doing the right thing when it comes to morality and truthfulness. There is even one scene where she hangs up on her father, no doubtably instilling the correct visions into her impressionable teen fan base. She couldn't give us a straight character to save her life. Coupled with the annoying Zoe Saldana who tries the hardest of the group, but cannot seem to quite understand the life surrounding her. Then, painful to write, there is Taryn Manning (who gets better with each film) using every clich√© redneck white-trash persona possible to define her character. It isn't bad enough that we have Spears fading in and out of her real character that to have Manning use y'all like it is Shakespeare &#150; yikes. Again, the acting isn't bad (I have seen far, far, far worse), but it isn't Juliard &#150; closer to flunking out of Acting 101.I have mediocre respect for director Tamra Davis. The woman that gave us the hysterical and near cult-classic Billy Madison as well as Half-Baked, has also turned out slow duds like Gun Crazy and, surprise, Crossroads. Her talent seems to be all over the place instead of choosing projects that will continue to define her. Listening to the commentary, it felt she did this to 1) work with Spears, 2) she needed the rent money, and 3) it was an all girl cast &#150; her youthfulness will be returned. Not exactly the typical reasons artist create on a blank slate. With Davis, I wanted humor, darkness, or anything that would make me remember why I loved Madison or Half-Baked' &#150; ANYTHING &#150; there was nothing. Did I expect it with Crossroads, probably not, but it would have been nice to see something that was uniquely hers. Road movies are made weekly, and it is those road films that try to bring something new to the genre that stand out and bring more to the table. Wasn't Billy Madison just a take-off of Back to School? I just question the ability of Davis without a studio baking and thankfully she has taken her raw, rotten talent to television only to further infuse the masses.We are left with nothing more than the story. What story did Crossroads tell? How about one lone girl's quest to find herself and loose her virginity? Does that sound right? Again, this wasn't rocket science writing, yet it seemed amateur from the first word. We know who Spears' love interest is going to be from the beginning, the take at the end is given away within the first twenty minutes, and the only strength to this entire film is a scene with Dan Aykroyd saying I was a Ghostbuster, a Blues Brother, and Conehead &#150; I did this film for my kids. I believe that sums up this whole story in a nutshell. Needless to say, the story lacked any depth, and there was one scene where we attempted to bring real life to the screen with a rape, an accidental death, and our old friend, underage drinking. Thankfully, Spears could push beyond all this and finally sing her songs near the end, the obvious finale to the film that was started. The ending point didn't match with the starting point in this film.So, I watched this film. Everyone will have to at one point in their life, I just shortened the inevitable. Again, it wasn't the worst film ever made, Glitter still ranks below this, but there wasn't any value in the final performance. Spears didn't push for this film to be made because she wanted to be an actress, she wanted more face time with an audience that seemed on the fence about her ability &#150; and as time has shown, we didn't make the best assumption. The acting wasn't horrible, but everything else was so we are left with a sour taste in our mouth coming from all directions. I will not, nor suggest this film to anyone except my wife, who thought it was better than Clerks II.Ouch. I will end on that note.Grade ** out of ***** "},{"Title":"Spectacularly awful","Date":"6 August 2006","Score":"6 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Music","Review":" What is the worst part of Crossroads... the ridiculous overacting on Britney Spears' part, the cheesy predictable plot, the shameless plugging of Britney Spears' music, the poor casting, the Britney!

There is Mimi, pregnant and just left alone by the father of her child. And there is Kit, very slim, very beautiful and very popular but set under pressure by her mother who is obsessed with beauty. All three have just finished school and are about to decide what they want to do with their future or, in Lucy's and Kit's case, what they parents want them to do with their future. Now Mimi gets the idea to drive to a song contest in L.A. and invites the other girls to come with her. So the three of them go on a road trip, every one for her own reasons and their driver is Ben, a musician, who wants to work in L.A. As you can imagine, at the end of their trip each of them has changed, learned a lesson and more or less reached her/his dream.It is obvious that the movie is nothing more but a glorification of Britney Spears and her talents. She looks great; she sings great, the Lucy star is shining above all. Everything circles around her, everyone always tries to cheer her up, she always has luck, she gets the boy and of course at the end it's she who gets the record deal her dreams. Watching the movie you really ask yourself why the other characters exist at all. The movie now and then tries to deal with them but then suddenly drops them to get back to Lucy. This happens many times. We get to know that Kit was chubby as a child but was violently pushed by her mother to lose weight. We also get to know that Mimi's pregnancy is the result of a rape and her only dream is to become a singer. But the script doesn't care. As soon as the story begins to concentrate on Mimi or Kit, something happens to Lucy and her friends immediately forget about her problems and concentrate on her. Ben also is nothing more but a toy boy whose role it is to cheer up Lucy, to make her happy and in the times he is not dealing with Lucy his role is to shut up and to look good. Also it is incredible how great those teenagers deal with the problems the script tortures them with and smile again ten seconds later.Concerning the way the movie is made I guess it aimed at teenagers and of course, fans of Britney. Yet I wouldn't recommend the movie to teenagers for many reasons. I would even forbid it to them. The movie pretends to be a light summer fairy tale but underneath it, it makes some really dangerous things looking very attractive. It implies for example that it's more than OK for a seventeen year old girl to cruise through the U.S. with a stranger, stay at every shabby motel, not to be afraid to go into bars for adults, participate in a song contest and dance like a stripper there and to have sex with whom she wants. Just to name some. Of course a road trip is an exciting thing but not for teenagers as they lack responsibility and sensibility and can quickly find themselves in dangerous situations they cannot deal with (yet).Don't get me wrong &#150; I think Britney is not too bad at acting and maybe a good singer. But I just wish that she made her debut in a better movie than this crap. It's a bad script, a really stupid plot where you don't know where it's aiming at and besides a waste of time for the actors having participated in it. I am sure, most of the viewers of this movie were and are teenagers but I really hope that they don't walk through the world being as na√Øve as Lucy.

I'm going to be frank with you. Britney Spears wasn't as bad an actor as I had expected. She did her job good. On the other hand, her character was just as boring and cuddly-wuddly as you'd expect. The film is just terribly, horribly predictable. I watched it with a few friend (we said to ourselves `Let's just watch it so we have it over with and can discuss how terrible it was!'), and one of them said `Before we see it, let me try and predict what will happen'. And he was very accurate and he never saw the movie before (if you watch it twice you have too much sparetime) or heard anyone tell the story of it. The director should be shot, the scrip-writer should have his hands cut off and the producer should be put on a spaceshuttle and sent into outer space. Yes, it's really that bad. Not the worst thing I've ever seen, but then again this movie had a big budget, which most of the really terrible movies don't have!It is, as you might expect, one big commercial for ms Spears. Nothing more, nothing less. The story-line has some really strange glitches and happenings that are either confusing, yet not, or totally uncalled for. For  example when she seeks up her mother, which left her (Britney) and her dad when she was 3 years old. Britney goes walking up the lawn and knocks on the door. Her mother opens and Britney says `Hello mother, it's me Lucy!' and her mother goes `Oh, come in!'. Very believable and `real' reaction from a woman who's not seen her child for 15 years. She doesn't even seem surprised. That's just one example of the things that are quite bizarre and disturbing in this movie.This is actually a movie everyone should see. This is a perfect example of how not to do it. This is a movie which everyone should have their own opinion about.

When actors and actresses choose a role in a movie already written, they are choosing to act based on if they liked the story or not. This film was written FOR Britney, and a film this bad would not be made without her in it.The film suffers from the same problems that have hurt Britney's career. It is not a film about finding the answers. It is a film about young girls going on a trip and their innocence is lost. It is not lost by normal situations. It is lost because Britney's character wants to have sex with some 30 year-old ex-con. Why? Because her screenplay does not know how to build romance. Instead it thinks that sex proves that she's found a bond.Britney Spears has been criticized for continuing to sexualize herself in videos and magazines instead of concentrating on making good music. This time she's using the same I'm not that innocent attitude in a movie that will be watched by some of her younger fans. I'm not sure how the parents of a ten year-old girl will feel after taking the child to see her favorite singer in the movie.I won't go into detail with the things going on with her friends, but a film like this is not for the fun loving Britney fan. I'm sure that Britney could have made a decent two-star average film that her younger viewers could enjoy. Maybe with SOMETHING funny actually happening in the film.This film is a complete disaster. Nothing causes anyone to truly care about the drama that the characters go through. It is a Britney Spears project without laughs, good drama, or good characters. The only person who did a good job was Dan Aykroyd, and his role was so small that he couldn't save this waste of film print.If you want to see a film that's bad, but TRIED to be good, see Glitter. If you want to see the worst film ever, see Hellraiser 4. If you want to see a film that's so bad it is funny, see Battlefield Earth.

If it werent for Britney Spears, the obsessive teens that saw this movie wouldn't have seen it, the media wouldn't have noticed it; come to think of it, nobody would have been foolish enough to direct such a poor movie off of such an absurd script.Predictability is the thing that stands out in my mind.  As I watched this movie on a plane ride from Hawai'i to LAX, I think I could have written the story out from the very beginning of the movie.  Every scene is so obvious and contrived from the previous ones that I feel like i'm watching a movie that was written by a High School Freshman Dance class.  Not only is the whole linear and boring plot predictable, but individual scenes are just as predictable.  This movie throws no surprises, curves, or has anything of interest.  From begining to end, this movie sloths forward to what would seem like a climax, but after an hour (two thirds of the movie) into the movie, its realized that there won't be a climax.  Three immature and childish (although all looking 20+) highschool girls go off on a roadtrip with some guy, and by the end of the movie the writers and directors must have realized that nothing was coming of the movie.  As such, they simply took all three character's shallow and contrived stories and wound them all together in a total writing-cop out.  The movie could have ended after the first scene, the second, or any other scene there after right up until the end and I don't think I would have noticed.The dialogue is miserable and the environments boring and have already all been done.  Britney's character, lucy, and her boyfriend/nerdy lab partner (whos name is forgotten after the second or third) decide to Do it after prom.  This never happens, because Lucy has doubts.  Are you sure you want to do it? she nervously asks, clad in bra and panty. The guy then proceeds to actually pull out a LIST of reasons WHY they should.  What planet are these people from?  The best part is that Lucy, after hearing the list, composed of such winners as Because we're lab partners, and I can't go to college a virgin, is actually temporarily convinced!  But, alas, Lucy is a smart girl and decides to wait for love. How thoughtful.  What depth.Britney, the typical amazingly-beautiful-yet-brilliant-nerd-gets-pushed-around-in-highschool, walks around highschool with her head hung low with her nerdy boyfriend/labpartner and plays pretty-made-fun-of-nerd-virgin-in-pink.  Speaking of Ms. Spears, I once heard someone say that this was a foray into new territory for Britney or a step in a new direction.  Folks, watch this movie and look at britney's character.  Britney's character, Lucy, is a nerd for the first part of the movie but all too soon, lucy turns into Britney Spears. She's an amazing singer, seductive dancer, cute little school girl charm and sexy blonde.  Britney Spears plays the same person she is in real life!  A move in another direction?  This whole movie is about her - its like a little biography or tribute, or even a music video with a few extra added in blocks of unused time.  Her acting is just like her music videos; dancing around like a blond fool with a great body.  To her credit, I've seen much worse acting.  She wasn't all that bad.  But, it wasn't hard.  SHE WAS PLAYING HERSELF.  Everyone else was just filler. As a matter of fact, any character at any given time could be replaced with any random person, or wholly taken out for that matter, and it would have little or no effect on the story.While watching this movie, we dont' care at all about the characters or what happens to them, but rather when Britney is going to get cherry picked.  It sounds lewd, but its true.  A few minutes into the movie, we already see Britney in JUST her bra and underwear, and shortly thereafter she almost has sex with some idiot.  The rest of the movie does a miserable job of portraying her budding romance with this guy she takes this absurd trip with, and of course at the end, they decide to do it.   Are you sure you're ready? he so kindly asks.  Yes, I want to do it.  Cry.  Tear. How great.This tribute to Britney's sex appeal and singing talent (which I very much hesitate to call it talent) is nothing more than throwing a pretty face into a shallow and aimless plot with a few other pretty faces.  Had I been given a full frontal lobotomy or had my ears surgically removed, I might have been able to sit through this movie without thinking I was being tortured or as Mystery Science theater 3000.Now, directors and writers out there, lets not make this mistake again.  If theres one thing this movie can do (besides bolster Britney record sales and worldwide appeal), its show future directors and writers what not do.  Lets not let this happen again.Meanwhile, I hope I'll see this on MST3k, or maybe on TV in a room full of drunk people.  Lets see Britney in a movie where she doesn't play an innocent yet sexy and attractive singer/dancer trying to find her self, and maybe then we can gauge her (lack of?) acting skills.

Now what I don't get is why, after making all the speeches about moving away from music, they all then make films in which they spend 80% of the time singing. This is one of those films. This is also one of those films that is adapted to the actor rather than the actor adapting to the film thereby negating the point of acting. This is also one serious ego film. It's good to see throughout the film how flawed Mimi and Kit are but how perfect Lucy is. Why, at the end of the film Mimi kills her unborn child and Kit gets dumped by her fiance but do they care? No - as long as Lucy's happy (gets the good-looking guy and wins the competition). People have complained about how acts like Britney Spears give young girls the message that you can't be successful unless you're well endowed, blonde and pretty. The film starts by telling how Mimi is going for a music audition but by the end of the film it's Britney winning the competition and Mimi just being a semi-suicidal maniac. Why? Because Mimi isn't blonde, well endowed or pretty. To cut the long story short, if you are a female under 13 who's got all Britney's albums and consider her your idol or you're a fifty year old weirdo who like eighteen year old girls you probably have already seen the film.

This film will make you laugh and cry more than Titanic but most of all, A STANDING OVATION during the credit roll.

Easily brings that young rebellion feel to a film. But when that is said, this movie is all but good. It takes on as many teen issues as possible and then deals with them in hand holding and overly sentimental Oprah-scenes over and over. The beginning of the film is the worst though with the extreme high school stereotypes in the popular student and the studying student. It also contains one of the worst scenes of the film with Lucy and her lab partner who have agreed to loose their virginity together. I suppose its supposed to be funny, but its not. Well at least you get to see Britney up close. So what about the pop princess acting skills? Very varied I'd say. She overacts every here and there and her meeting with her mom is another low water mark in that area. But then again she handles the motivated sentimental scenes with ease. Her little talk with her father in the beginning is quite ok and later her talk with the guy in the film after meeting her mom is pretty brilliant. So to sum up on that she's not without acting skills but she overacts like seldom seen and that partly is to blame on the director directing a first-timer. Further on in the movie the dialogue generally feels very unspontanious as does alot of dramatic scenes that are much fuss over nothing. Well that was about all, I'll give it a 2/10. If you're particularly in love with these cheap teen flicks, or if you in fact are a young little teen, or if you just want a chance to watch Britney you might enjoy the movie, at least a little. Otherwise you have 99/100 odds of randomly finding a better choice.

The other actors, honestly, are equally as horrible and forced me and my friends to come to the conclusion that they must have cast bad actors on purpose in an attempt to make Britney look better. I will say though that one scene - the scene where Britney reads the lyrics to one of her songs as poetry to the boy - was one of the more hilarious things I've seen, even if it wasn't *intentionally* funny.I wonder what Britney's friends and family or fellow celebrities said to her after the premiere of this monumental bore...did they just have to force a well, it was...interesting! so to not hurt her feelings?

Britney's body is exploited, as usual, very quickly into the film.  To my dismay, the only two occurrences of this happen in the first 10 minutes of the film.  In the opening scene she is dancing in her underwear, and in a later scene she is seen again in her underwear about to loose her so called `virginity' to her lab partner of three years.  It's really sad that these are the only good things to come out of this movie. 	Crossroads is the acting debut for the one called Britney Spears.  Shonda Rhimes, who has no previous writing experience, wrote the Crossroads story.  I have read rumors that Shonda wrote the story specifically for Britney as the lead character.  Tamra Davis, who has such gems as Half Baked and Billy Madison under her belt, directs Crossroads.  There are no other notables involved with this film, because let's face it; the only reason one would see this movie is for Britney.  Justin Long of Jeepers Creepers fame does make an appearance however.  It is also rumored that he tried out for the role of Henry as a joke, and to his and everyone else's surprise somehow got the role.  He thought that it was the chance of a lifetime to have the opportunity to kiss Britney, and have it immortalized on video.  He made the same choice that any other male would have made, and chose to accept the role. 	I interpret Crossroads as a semi-fictional biography of Britney Spears.  I guess it can be comparable to Mariah Carey's Glitter.  Apparently it is up to the viewer to determine what to take as fact and what to deem fiction. 	The demographic of people in the theater ranged from 15-year-old girls to 16 year old girls.  Big surprise, huh?  I thought I was alone when I didn't take Britney Spears seriously, but guess again.  You would think that Crossroads was intended to be a comedy from all the laughter that occurred.  I can tell that Britney put 110% of her acting ability into making this film.  It's too bad that it will never be good enough.  Britney does not posses the charisma or ability to be an actor.  She just cannot achieve movie stardom because she does not posses any potential to do so.  During Britney's big scene, she attempts to show her sensitive side and cry, yet, no waterworks are involved.  The entire theater was in an uproar of laughter during this scene.  I found myself laughing at the fact that Britney is a joke to not only me, but also everyone else.  The only reason to see this film is if you absolutely cannot get enough of Britney, and her twins.  That's it. 	The movie also attempts to cover five season's worth of 7th Heaven life controversies in 90 minutes.  The movie deals with running away from home, premarital sex, underage drinking, abortion, miscarriages, cheating, `fitting in', rape, and so many more.  There are just too many to list.  I mainly have a problem with the premarital sex, and underage drinking.  Girls who look up to Britney as a role model are being sent the wrong message.  Britney's character tells us that it is all right to have premarital sex, as long as it is with someone special.  Her character also tells us that underage drinking is fine too.  Whoops, looks like someone made a mistake. 	 I am hoping and praying that this is the first and last movie project fueled by Britney Spears.  I am also only giving her one more album release before she poses in Playboy to try and revitalize her career.  Let's all try and pretend that this movie was never made, because I sure would.

Simply put, my girlfriend dragged me to it, kicking and screaming. That's the only logical reason for any guy to see it (or any human being, for that matter). This was evidenced by the fact that the theater I was sitting in was comprised of 90% giggling girls between the ages of 12 and 17, and the last 10% was guys who had been dragged there and had the same deer-in-the-headlights look on their face that I no doubt had on mine.This movie is god-awful in so many different ways, but let us begin with Titney, I mean Britney Spears. Her acting ability is about on the same level as her singing boring, unoriginal, completely devoid of talent. Her idea of a Southern accent is to throw in a y'all here and there (does anybody on this planet actually use that word?).

It has your geeky ugly girl that will soon blossom into a beautiful woman, the sassy black girl, the mysterious guy with bad hair, and a new element, the white trash chick.  While the plot is paper thin and predictable (how shocking), it also tries to gain credibility by tackling issues such as child abandonment, teen pregnancy, and even rape.  These events are force fed upon the viewer and merely expose the movie as the superficial marketing ploy it truly is.And that's basically all this movie is, a giant commercial.  Britney's new CD is especially forced upon the viewer as they are subjected to three renditions of Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman and an atrocious cover of I Love Rock 'n Roll that proves Joan Jett is low on cash.  The acting is yet another horrible aspect of this film.The saddest part is, Britney isn't even the worst actress in the movie, Taryn Manning's portrayal of Mimi is something that would make Shelly Duvall look like Jodie Foster.  Anson Mount, who plays Ben seems to be bored out of his skull the entire movie, and it's downright depressing to see Dan Aykroyd reduced to acting in a movie like this.I knew going into the theater this movie would be an abomination, and it certainly lived up to my expectations.

Too bad contest's require at least minimal skill, including the ability to sing dance, and not act like a stupid, spoiled whore. OOPS! Three out of three! Britney Spears struck out with this film, after producing multiple albums with other people's songs redone in shoddier, cheaper versions, and asking Hugh Heffner for a wopping 100 million for a center fold pose.

She was the only interesting actress and character out of the three main characters - her monologue in the hospital scene actually made me cry, it was so touching. Following Taryn, I thought Zoe Saldana was quite good too, despite her character being the token bitch. The plot line was weak, and the script even weaker. And don't even TALK about Britney's acting. If all she wanted was some cheap publicity, then she got it. She should definitely stick to singing - watching her acting is like slow torture. Dan Akroyd is a good actor though, and he shouldn't have even considered being in this film - it'll be a black mark on his career.Anyone wanting to see the movie - please reconsider - it's an hour and a half of your life you'll never get back.

It is. These kind of movies are disgrace to the cinema. You might enjoy it if you're Britney Spears fan or below age of 14. If you're not and still think it's good, you need therapy ASAP. Reading comments here, I just couldn't believe some people actually think this movie has some depth. What??? They put everything in 90 or so minutes growing up, relationship between friends, relationship between parents and children, first love, rape, teen pregnancy... Each of this issues is so complex it deserves its own movie. So if you try to deal with all of them in one movie, of course it turns out shallow and ridiculous. For example, Mimi lost her unborn child. Something like that would leave a scar for life. But few days later, she's partying and singing back vocals at audition. Movie trivialized the issue so much it's disgusting. I know it wasn't supposed to be a heavy drama, but why putting rape and miss-carriage in the movie at all? They could easily avoid it and with that actually improve the movie by making it more believable. Another thing - all three girls experienced some very traumatic moments (Lucy rejected by her own mother, Mimi lost a child, Kit is cheated by her fiance), but this things don't change them at all. At the end of the movie they are completely the same as at the beginning.The vast amount of cliches in this movie is overwhelming and characters are completely two-dimensional. I must say I agree with reviews which say this movie is rated so low just because Britney Spears appears in it. But she brought that to herself. I never disliked her, I actually kinda liked some of her songs (it's decent pop), but after I saw the movie, I'm starting to. Lucy played by Britney is so smart, lovely, cute, full of values and virtues, she never say or does anything wrong. Miss Spears probably wants us to believe she's like that in real life. Besides, if she wants to be taken seriously as an actress, she shouldn't sing in her movie. That said, I must admit she actually wasn't that bad. I haven't seen many popcorn teen movies, but I remember seeing 10 things I hate about you and I wouldn't say actress in leading role was in any way much better than Britney. Interesting, one scene in which we could find out more about Britney's acting abilities wasn't showed on the screen. I'm talking about her mother telling her she didn't want her in the first place, that she was a mistake. That scene would require some convincing acting to be believable, and I can't help wondering if they deliberately didn't include it because Britney wasn't capable of doing it. But okay, that's just a speculation.So, final conclusion Movie is very bad, at times plain ridiculous, but it shouldn't be on worst movies list, or to put it differently if this movie deserves to be on that list, then most of teen movies should also.

Flash forward to Graduation Day and the three girls have gone their separate ways Lucy is a nerd and (horror of horrors!) a virgin, Kit is a beauty-obsessed snob, and Mimi is poor white trash and five months pregnant. Circumstances nevertheless throw the three back together and they unearth the time capsule, only to realize that their lives have not lived up to their dreams. On impulse they decide to embark on a road trip to California, with the hunky-yet-sensitive musician Ben along for the ride.Two words could describe this movie unoriginal and lame. For example, Lucy's father is pressuring her into medical school when her real love is singing, but of course his outlook is completely changed after he sees her spectacular performance at the movie's climax. One gets the feeling that if these two morons just sat down and held a *conversation* with one another the whole conflict would have been avoided. The humor isn't funny, and there's nothing cute or entertaining about the girls dancing and singing along to Madonna or Shania Twain every other scene. Of course this review has to mention Crossroads' star, Britney Spears. Spears' lackluster acting chops, combined with the bad script, makes for one very unimpressive heroine. Britney's Lucy is (naturally) Valedictorian, but she doesn't have the intelligence to stop the road trip once she hears that the man driving her and her friends may be a convicted murderer. She's mocked for being pure and virginal, but she can still pole dance with the best of them. Lucy's braininess is also such a turn off that the only guy at school who'd want her is her socially-inept lab partner. Are you buying this? Didn't think so. Despite the title being Crossroads, there actually aren't any in the movie. Lucy meets her deadbeat mother and loses her virginity to a guy she barely knows, Kit learns that her boyfriend is a cheat and a rapist, and Mimi suffers a miscarriage. Things have happened, yet no lessons have been learned, and no apparent changes have been made. That is why the movie ultimately fails. In the final scene the girls are all exactly the same, dancing and giggling as if life is one big, never-ending slumber party.

Painfully, embarrassingly bad movie that lived down to everyone's expectations. Once in a while a nonprofessional actor (athlete, singer, model, etc.) will surprise you and actually turn in a good performance in a decent movie; Mandy Moore comes to mind. More often than not, though, their lack of training and/or talent is glaringly obvious, and there's no more perfect example of that than this stinker. Britney's stage presence consists mainly of her running around in various stages of semi-nudity (not that there's anything wrong with that), stroking herself, jumping up and down, shaking her butt and thrusting her boobs (if they actually ARE hers--you know the rumors as well as I do) towards the audience. While that may get 12-year-old boys and 75-year-old erectionally-challenged former U.S. Vice Presidents up and running, it doesn't work on a movie screen. Take away the shaking, moaning, groaning and fondling in her act, and she has virtually no stage presence; in this film she has even less than that. She may be trying to become the next Madonna, but someone should have told her about Madonna's movie career; there's a lesson to be learned there, but I don't think Britney will learn it. She has been quoted as saying that she intends to pursue a full-time acting career. Well, she can pursue it all she wants, but she won't catch it. Giggling, jumping up and down on a bed in your underwear (not that there's anything wrong with that) and flashing that annoyingly goofy grin of hers doesn't pass for acting, although she and her trainers . . . er, managers are apparently under the impression that it does, as they have her do it repeatedly. I don't know what the box-office grosses on this film were, but I would imagine--I would hope, actually--that they weren't very impressive. Hopefully, that will discourage the likes of Britney, Mariah Carey, etc., from thinking that a successful singing career can automatically translate into a successful film career. A singer can get by without knowing how to sing particularly well, as in Britney's case (Carey, for her almost complete lack of acting talent, has an incredible voice and is a far, far better singer than Britney will ever be), but a lack of acting talent isn't conducive to a movie career, Tom Cruise's success notwithstanding.If Hollywood would stop wasting time and money on crap like this, and on no-talent wanna-be movie stars, maybe some singers, actors, directors, writers, etc., with actual talent and something to say could get some good movies made, and we would be seeing more of them and less of the likes of Britney Spears.Nah.

The atomic cry emanating from the camera shutter gate would have made the folks at CERN green with envy for the profuse expulsion of sub-atomic particles created by the silver halide nuclear genocide of would have made the multi-billion dollar collider a moot point.However, as bad as this is there are a couple of redeeming qualities that will catapult this film into the status of a timeless and endearing classic. 1. The CIA and other letter agencies can use it as a torture mechanism. This film coupled with copious insertions of the singing Tro-Lo-Lo guy will make water boarding seem like a folk dance. You want the information? 30 minutes of this puerile tripe and any hardened spy, criminal, or terrorist will spill their guts pronto. Hell they'll probably make some up too just to end the onslaught before irrevocable damage is done. 2. UCLA film school can use it as a frame-by-frame forensic study of how not to make a movie. This requisite first-year, first-semester post- mortem will take the most resolute future filmmaker or writer and have them run screaming from the campus giving up the Hollywood dream only to become a used car or insurance sales person. Nothing like weeding out the weak stomach wannabe's.

Then I reluctantly stepped into the colesseum known as Crossroads to be thrown into the theatrical Ring of Death. I was unknowingly put up against an ambush of formidable adversaries. The screenwriters, leading the assault, started with the sledge hammer of bad characterization.

I told them I get it, but they just wouldn't listen.

Hell, they could've gotten away with it--especially since the film contains no foul language or nudity.  This should've NEVER made it to the big screen! Britney is--and I say this without hesitation--a horrible actress.  In one scene she's crying to her father (Dan Aykroyd) without tears!  Did she take any acting lessons prior to making the film?  Most of the cast is second-rate, but there's some wasted talent here and there.  I don't know what is it with Dan Aykroyd.  He hasn't had a memorable role since Coneheads!  He went from an SNL superstar to taking on thankless roles like this!  If I were Mr. Aykroyd, I'd fire my agent.  Zoe Saldana, who was great in Center Stage (an underrated flick I really admire), is good but she has very little to work with in such a two-dimensional role.  Every character in the movie is two-dimensional.  The screenwriter must've read Character Arcs for Dummies.  Kim Cattrall only has about two minutes of screen time, and that was a good move on her part.  I can tell she's concerned about her reputation.  The plot is contrived and predictable.  There are many melancholy moments, but I couldn't feel a single emotion--unless you count boredom as an emotion--because all the plot points are created in such a labored Hollywood fashion.  From the very beginning, I was extremely turned off.  We're introduced to the three main characters.  Lucy (Britney) is established as an introverted bookworm who hangs out with the geek squad.  Yet she still wears sexy, cleavage-enhancing outfits.  Her ex-friend Kit (Saldana) is one of those stuck-up popular girls who hisses at the sight of girls like Lucy.  And her other friend is a pregnant tomboy.  This is such an obvious setup and we know that they're all going to end up arm-in-arm, as best friends again, by the end of the film.  We're not stupid.  About the only positive thing I can note (and this is just for the guys out there) is Britney wears some very sexy outfits.  In the opening scene, she's dancing in her underwear.  Now, I'm not one of those hypocrites who takes delight in bashing Britney.  I think she has a reasonable amount of talent as a singer.  I'm not a big fan of hers, but I like some of her music.

I, for one, am a Britney Spears fan, and for everyone who thinks that of course every fan would love it, that is just not true. I was able to give the actual film a chance and love it for what it is. Of course I still loved Britney, but the movie is actually really entertaining and enjoyable for me, and I strongly wish that would have been the case for more people, but it was not.The movie is just all around very fun and entertaining. It has very likable performances, a nice plot and great spunk that I find myself very amused with every time I watch it. The characters, while I admit they could have been better written, were all very lovable and excellently portrayed, and while there is a lot of dried out material, because I understand it is not a masterpiece, it was not meant to be a masterpiece to begin with and the material works for what the films tries to be, which is just a guilty pleasure, even though I am certainly not guilty for loving it. It plays out very well, spending enough time on the three girls at the beginning to give us a sense of their personalities and friendship so we can learn more about them as the film progresses, and while there are some antics along the middle of the film that some might find boring and meaningless, I thought all the mishaps and faults with the characters' lives were very relevant and meaningful. It is a bit mediocre at times, and like I said some characters, like Lucy's parents, could have been better developed, but it is ultimately satisfying to what I was looking for when I sat down to watch it.It was a nice road trip movie, and has aspired a cult following over the years by many people who see it for what it is instead of not letting themselves have a good time with it. I think it is very enjoyable and it has some heartfelt scenes, excellent songs and an overall great feel and atmosphere to it.

Filled with 90's pop hits and a few Brittany songs, it really is the heartbeat that this film deserved.

Lucy (Britney Spears), Kit (Zoe Saldana), and Mimi (Taryn Manning) were once very close in childhood and pledged friendship forever. Years later, we find they have grown apart. Spears' parents are separated and she has an overbearing father (Dan Aykroyd) intent on pushing her into medical school. Kit, self-centred and with a fianc√© in Los Angeles, feels her old friends are beneath her. Mimi is pregnant, but she still hopes to make a career in show business. For different reasons they all end up in a car driven by Justin (Anson Mount) on the way to L.A. and differences soon set in...   Spears' debut movie turns out to be a lightweight chick flick, pleasing if ultimately unmemorable. Crossroads, written for the star, not unexpectedly plays around the Spears' persona, a much-hyped virginal nature in which one can choose to believe or not. Her attempts to have it both ways is manifest in the song '(I'm) Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman' while the film's major vocal set-pieces (bedroom, karaoke and final concert) together form an arc, taking the singer from daddy's girl to performing woman of some experience. Blonde, clean and slightly bland, Spears' nearest screen equivalent is probably Doris Day. But while making a game enough effort at playing the undemanding part of Lucy, she lacks that useful Rock Hudson-type to play up against. The character of the rough-and-ready Justin (in whose car the three girls spend much of the time) is comparatively underwritten, without the balance and irony required.     Spears gives an understated performance, not as bad as some critics have made out, although it is hard for her to overcome the dullness of a character whose most dramatic moment (for many viewers) is to dance around her bedroom in her underwear. The long-telegraphed dalliance with Justin, his tattooed back and all, is in stark contrast to the hesitation she shows earlier when the inexperienced Henry tried to bed her. Clearly Lucy has discovered something about herself along the road, best demonstrated by her final move to independence from her father. What this is exactly, apart from a preference for amenable ex-cons, is uncertain. Her failure to articulate herself either before, and after, her journey (although her dissatisfaction with her life is hinted at) is regrettable, for it leaves her character's potential unfulfilled and the audience none the wiser. This is not helped by the fact that her crucial interview with her mother, exactly the time when Lucy would have been most emotionally exposed is omitted, related by her only briefly in retrospect. Lucy is too private for her own good.   While Lucy's attraction for Justin is understandable to most women viewers, the peculiarly understanding nature of her father is less so. He has cosseted his daughter over a number of years, worked and saved to further her career, then comes all the way to L.A. to bring her back home. His then mute acceptance of Lucy casually rejoining a guy she met on the road (as well his vaguely ludicrous expression of enjoyment during her final concert) is far fetched, to say the least. That Aykroyd manages to smooth over a lot of his character's unconvincing behaviour is a tribute more to his ability of inducing suspension of disbelief, than any dramatic truth in the script.     The other two girls in the plot require less discussion. As the snooty black bitch two-timed by her fianc√©, Kit's fall from her high horse is just as predictable as Mimi's pregnancy, once it has served its purpose, is suddenly dispensable. One senses that a better film could have been made had there been a single travelling companion created for Lucy, perhaps just the worldly and 'soiled' Mimi, whose air of gritty determination is perhaps the most convincing item in the film. Her lack of development as a character is regrettable, as she has more to offer Lucy in the way of an education in life than the slightly vacuous Justin.     At the end of the day, the success of Crossroads depends on how Spears is showcased, rather than the strengths and weaknesses of the supporting cast. Other singers, notably Prince and Madonna, have made much more self-indulgent and less quietly entertaining films than this. Fans of the singer will find Spears' vocalising in pink bra and panties agreeable enough; some will enjoy the slight coming of age plot passes the time; others may want something more substantial for their money.

The plot is rather minimal, it only comes back to you every now and then. 3/4 of the reason for this movie seems to be, Wow, listen to her sing! Every few minutes in the movie they go off singing again. I also thought it was kind of funny the pregnant one was trying to become a famous singer. Kind of crazy. All-in-all, its really just pointless. I can only assume it was made to boost her fame.

Britney Spears ? Funny. She has to copy Madonna in every way, doesn't she ? And it can only be bad, can't it ? But it's funny. So I had to watch it.Well, the basic idea for the script was NOT bad. A movie about the problems of teenager girls. That is, about friendship between girls, finding an identity, finding their own way, boyfriends, first sex, date rape, unwanted pregnancy and so on.Unfortunately, the script author didn't managed to get a really interesting story out of it. Instead of some living characters, we only get more or less stereotypical ones. It was however very realistic, and mentioned many of the real life problems teenager girls might get into.And who wants to see Britney in underwear (and likewise dressings), throughout the whole movie again and again and again ? That was not very original.Another problem of the movie was music. Many scenes where only there to promote the new song of Britney, 'Not a girl', and therefore simply nerved.The acting, however, was really not bad. I didn't expected anything from Britney, but in fact I've to state that I've seen far worser actresses than her. The script was the problem, not her acting.But what also really sucked was Britneys idea that she could actually sing. It wasn't really a big problem as long as she was singing her own material. But at one place of the movie, she compares herself to nobody less than - Joan Jett ! By singing Jett's song I love Rock n' Roll before a mass of people, who pretended that her singing was actually good, while in fact she had not even enough voice to be really understandable ! It was so bad, so abysmal, so painfull !!!The acting of the others wasn't bad either, I especially liked Taryn Manning (appeared already in Crazy/Beautiful with Kirsten Dunst).If you want to watch a really good movie of this kind, I would recommend the fantastic masterpiece 'Strike' with Heather Matarazzo, Kirsten Dunst, Rachael Leigh Cook, Lynn Redgrave and many others, plus an excellent script.

I just think she's fun to watch, whether complaining about how her dancing is killing her on the latest episode of Making the Video or talking with Rosie O'Donnell about just how much she loves Justin Timberlake, that stick figure boyfriend of hers. I like her presence. I like that she seems like she'd be cool to hang out with, like she's the sort of girl who's nice enough that your parents would like her but also the sort who's wild enough that you know she'd say bad words about her own parents behind their back.Crossroads, her film debut, is complete cheese. It's not childish in the issues it deals with (sex, drinking, date rape, child abandonment, miscarriage), but it doesn't deal with those issues in any profound sort of way. In the film, if Britney's friend, White Trash Girl, had been retarded and Britney'd been on speed and run through a plate-glass window, then essentially you'd have every Helen Hunt Afterschool Special ever made. Her acting, given the story, is competent enough.If you go into the theater with a playful attitude and are ready to make fun of it as a parody of every predictable teen message movie ever made, though, Crossroads provides you with a damn fine time. Try to watch it without referring to any character by their given name, since all the characters are archetypes anyway, and the formula behind the film becomes both apparent and laughable.Britney (the Smart Girl), White Trash Girl and Popular Girl used to be friends, but the evils of high school society have forced them to break up their once solid friendship. Through odd twists of chance and through the arrival of, dare I say it, restructured priorities, they reunite, renew their friendship and hit the road with Really Cute Guy With A Past.Each has their own goal, of course. (It's a formula road movie.) Britney wants to find out why her nouveau-riche skank of a mother abandoned her. Recently knocked up, White Trash Girl wants to get out of the trailer park and feel the Pacific Ocean on her toes. Popular Girl wants to visit her fiance. Along the way, much of the usual fun and shenanigans occur as each of the girls (sob!) finds they have to grow up and learn about the real world. And then, they all sing!At face value, it's not that bad of a movie.

I have no doubt that Justin will be nominated for Best Actor at next year's Academy Awards. It incenses me that no one else has recognized his true talent. Unfortunately Justin cannot save what is ultimately bad scripting (Shonda Rhimes), editing (Melissa Kent ) and directing (Tamra Davis). The other problem I have with the film is the ending.

It goes for pathos when a free spiritedness would have done just fine.  They made BOYS ON THE SIDE when they should have made CLUELESS.  And worst of all - they ruined the best decision they made.  Kim Cattrall was INSPIRED casting as Brit's mom.  But she's in it for three minutes, and she too is stifled under a frown of world-weary depression.

Because there are always those exact same close minded people who can't seem to picture them as anything but the singer they are. I think Britney did pretty good. Even though, my favorite actress in this movie had to have been Taryn Manning, who played Mimi.

Britney's acting was okay.  She was mostly believable, probably because her character, Lucy, was so like herself. There were times when I was even impressed with her acting.  Her 'crying boo-hoo' scenes were pretty good.  She's no Julia or Annette, but, like I said, it is her first movie.Spoilers ahead...The story line was less than impressive.  It was incredibly predictable, while at the same time being totally implausible.  The movie tries to touch on 'real' teen problems, but it just comes off as contrived and even scary. I was actually quite disturbed with all the hardships loaded onto one character, Mimi (played be Taryn Manning).  She gets date raped, pregnant, and then falls down stairs and miscarries.  In the end, it seems like they just blow off what happened to her.  I actually could not sleep last night thinking about what happens to that poor character.  In a movie such as this, you'd think all the characters would end up happy, but I just don't see how she could ever be.  I've been truly unable to think about anything else in regards to the movie.  That whole story line overshadows the movie; how can we be expected to care about Lucy's problems ('she doesn't wanna be a doctor!!') while another character is dealing with extreme crisis.  If I was a teenager or preteen seeing this movie, I would be scared out of my wits.  The miscarriage should not have happened; it was just too much.I certainly would not recommend this movie unless you're a huge Britney fan. If you have to see what all the fuss is about, at least go on cheap movie night.  And be prepared, maybe dont bring your little girls to this; this movie would be too much for them.

That's not even including the nice hotels they slept in for the rest of the trip and other expenses. 2) Why is this movie so predictable? I mean, OF COURSE the boyfriend is cheating. C'mon. But they could of at least spiced it up a little. Maybe he could be with another guy! The plot twist was good with him and Mimi... I won't give the one 'surprise' element away to those who haven't seen the movie. 3) In the scene where the girls are rebonding and sharing life stories, Britney (oh, sorry, Lucy) tells them about the drama surrounding her mother leaving her when she was 3. If they were friends when they were young, wouldn't they already know that her mom wasn't a part of the picture? It's not like they just met. 4)The movie covered every issue possible as quickly as you can say 7th Heaven. Teen pregnancy, drinking, love, abandonment, parental problems (although no real mention is made of Mimi's parents, the fact that she's the 'trailer park girl' is mentioned frequently), unity, abuse, rape, miscarriage (oops... sorry. you know i was REAL tempted to say 'I did it again' there but i was strong!) But the most classic scene of the movie would have to be when Lucy aka Brit Brit reads her 'poetry', which is the spoken words of I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman. I laughed out loud. Literally, knee-slapping laughing. While I went in knowing it wasn't going to be an Oscar winning flick, it didn't completely suck. If you're going to see it, make sure to go to a matinee or wait until it's at cheap theatres or better yet, on video and DVD. It's not worth $8.00-$10.00.

But it isn't as bad as people say. It isn't any great, but there are much worst movies than this. I think that people in general tend to judge it too hardly.Cross Roads is notorious for being the first adventure of Britney Spears in the world of cinema. Back then she was a successful singer (although her songs aren't any worthy, except for I'm not a girl, not yet a woman) and she was at the top of her success. It was the Britney Spears fever. This literally created too much expectations about this film.This film is nothing more than mediocre or okay. It is a weak and predictable movie. Not much of a movie, but even so it has its funny moments, especially the part when the 3 girls steal Ben's car and drive him crazy. His reaction in that scene is so classic, very similar to that of the character Charlie Babbitt (from Rain Man) after a phone call. It was also funny how the girls were scared of Ben, thinking that he was a murderer, when in reality he was a nice guy.Overall, this is a movie that I recommend more for the fans of Britney Spears (if they still exist...). I can understand why this film is so under-appreciated, but even so I'm surprised with such a low rating!

Before I get started here, I firmly believe that people do not know how to be objective with Britney.  I don't know what it is but for some reason everyone is out to get her.  No! this was not a masterful performance, but it was not the worst thing or even close.  Especially for a first movie. Giving this a 1 like over 1,000 people did meant this movie had absolutely nothing to it at all.  I disagree!!!The movie was okay in my opinion.  It had a good overall meaning.  You had three friends who made a vow as kids to dig up a box that they buried having things in it that represented who they were and what they wanted to be. They planned to do this on prom night, not really thinking that when they grew up they would have gone there separate ways.  Needless to say nobody really wants to do it when the time comes because they have to many other problems to worry about but they end up doing it.They find out later that they have mutual need to take a trip together. Zoe to see her boyfriend who never comes back from college to see her, Mimi (taryn) to sing for a recording contract, & Lucy (britney) to resolve issues with her mom who left her and her father when she was young.The trip in my opinion is too long, and that is where the problems begin for me.  Too much singing in the car.  I guess it wasn't horrible, but it mad me very uneasy I even felt the need to shut it off. If you can make it through that part your home free.  In a way it showed how they were struggling to get along with each other.  I just think it could have been done in a much more intriguing way. During this trip Lucy and Zoe find out that Ben (anson) spent some time in prison. Ben was the one doing the driving.  Yes driving with 3 pretty women, I feel sorry for him.  They did deal with his feelings of not fitting in with the 3 girls.  So that added even more indifference to the mix.   None of the girls wanted to be alone with Ben in case he was dangerous.  He was one of Zoe's friends so it wasn't like he was a complete stranger.  They later find out he did some time for protecting his mother from his father who was an alcoholic I believe.Overall after struggling with each others company.  Lucy finds out for herself that her mother wants nothing to do with her, and that she has half brothers that she has never met.  Zoe surprises her boyfriend at college who is with another girl.  She also finds out that her boyfriend is the one who raped the Taryn Manning character and got her pregnant.  And after a frustrating question of friendship between the two girls Mimi runs away and falls down the steps, losing her baby.  This tragedy brings the three together for the first time in the movie. In the end Lucy and her father become closer because she realizes her father did whatever he could to raise her, and her father realizes she is growing up and there will come a time when he needs to let her make her own mistakes.Like I said before there is a good point to this movie, and anyone who says it is worthless or a 1 is not being objective. Britney's acting was okay! She needs a little work on the dramatic parts but not an embarassment like some people say.  The components where there, it just needed some tweeking. The whole issue with Lucy's mom could have been allot longer, that just kind of dissolved into a short segment.  Too much singing also even though in some parts it was necessary.

The plot simple enough, is even a bit overused in the film industry marketed towards women girl leaves home in search of her own.  Along the way she finds renewed friendship, romance, and her dreams come true.  Trite?  Of course, but MTV Films tries to make this coming-of-age movie more edgy and sexy, by adding the number one pop diva of our time.The outcome of the story is unsurprising from the beginning, a plot like this seems all too familiar (2000 film, Coyote Ugly?), but take the film for what it is  a modern-day cliche-ridden, and utterly predictable film from the start, but aren't most chick flicks now a days anyway?  Give Miss Spears a break--granted she hasn't been as successful as other crossover artists, such as Jennifer Lopez, but she hasn't been as unsuccessful as NSYNC's Lance Bass (his 2001 film debut in On the Line, reviewed far worse).  I'd give her performance a 6 out of ten.Crossroads isn't Oscar worthy, in the least, but does a movie have to win an award to make you laugh, or smile, or even feel good?  No matter how predictable, or even cheesy it is, Crossroads has a feel-good vibe, and if you don't read too much into it, could even be considered a good film. Spears is underdeveloped as an actress, but obviously puts her whole heart and soul into the film; lucky for the singing sensation they grant her a 5 minute karaoke scene in which she gets to belt out Joan Jett's hit, `I love Rock 'n' Roll', while swivelling her trademark hips and showing her famous navel.The Queen of Pop might be better suited to rule over her own kingdom, but for her first premier film debut, it could've been worse, and Britney definitely did leave me satisfied. As a skeptic from the beginning, I hesitantly paid my $5.00 to watch 94 minutes of the Queen of Pop prance around in her undies and a towel.  And surprisingly, I had a good time!  Besides the eye candy (think Anson Mount), Spears, Saldana, and Manning, bring to life a typical high school scenario. And what better way to ignite an old friendship than a road trip? Simply said, if a plot centered towards pre-teen to young adults, starring teen idol Britney Spears doesn't float your boat, don't pay to see Crossroads.  Like many other MTV flicks that attempt to help music stars cross over, Crossroads isn't any different.  It doesn't have A+ actors or even Oscar-worthy script writers, but take it as it is, a film created by Music Television; these are the people who also brought you Road Trip, the grossly disgusting hit of 2000--I think they've come along way since then.If you can ignore the fact that Britney Spears is the star of this film (for those of you that are revolted by the thought!) there is the possibility that this film will bring you some enjoyment.  And for a pop star that's `not a girl, not yet a woman', Britney Spears gives a mediocre performance. The reviews on this film might not be as good as her `Britney Does Las Vegas' Concert, but then again, she is just a pop star.

When she cried, I totally bought it. When she laughed, I truly thought she was happy. Nothing seemed forced with her and acting seemed to come very naturally to the pop star. I only wish it didn't get so many bad reviews. I think most people didn't want to see it because the majority of the population (women) are jealous of her. But just watch closely, and you'll notice that even in places like Wal-Mart, you might see a girl who hates Britney with a passion pick up a magazine with her face on the cover. People are obsessed with her and there has to be a reason for it. They can say they hate her all they want but the truth is-they don't know her or who she really is and they want to so badly that it drives them mad. Think about it.

Now i ain't going to say Crossroads is some masterpiece, far from.. but it seems people are being much too cynical towards it, maybe they see it as simply being some marketing tool for Britney Spears. Sure she may sing two tracks from her album, and she ends up becoming a singer of sorts in the story, but that doesn't seem to be the prime focus or drive of the film, but if she didn't sing, then a lot of her real fans would have been very disappointed.And people who say Britney is an AWFUL Actress should really go see some more films. She performed her role as well as any debut actress could, in no way would i say she even comes close to being rated as poor, and neither did any of the proffesional critics think that either! Critics may be harsh with films, but they generally know their stuff about performances. I thought she did pretty well, and didn't seem to just play herself, though her debut role really should have been even less of her and more someone else, if she wanted to make a mark in the world of film. Mandy Moore seemed to make the right move in that respect.So the film, the story has no real inspiration or passion, it's very by the numbers, the 'twist' can be seen a thousand miles off, and at the end the movie is nothing more than a glossy TV Movie. But like most ok TV Movies, they pass the time quite well, just like this one.. sure it's pretty cheesy in places, but i can see a certain age group of girls really liking this film.. it's been very well made for them.I personally would have preffered Britney's debut film to have taken itself less seriously, and be more in vein with something like She's All That, something a bit more frothy that didn't try too hard at being all grown up and mature, with teenage pregnancies and runaway mothers. A huge proportion of people who are going to see a film like this and be the key flagposts in a strong word-of-mouth campaign would be slightly older teens.. and Britney it seems would have been perfect for a well made film like that. i.e Bring It On, many guys went to see it just for the girls in short skirts, but most of them went on to recommend it to friends, because it was completely unpretensious and totally enjoyable, while appealing to both sexes.. had they coupled that with seeing Britney in her underwear, then they would have had a sure-fire hit, and a much stronger rating here.This would probably sound less offensive if i was female, but her next film should be directed by a man.. no disrespect to Tamra Davis, i LOVE Billy Madison and Half-Baked, but when it comes to handling women on screen and their sexuality, no one does it better than a man.. look at what Hitchcock did for his leading ladies!!If you are wondering whether to watch this film, and are not really a fan of Britney, but just wanted to watch a teen movie, then i would personally recommend a few others before this one.. but i wouldn't completely disregard it. Non-Cynical movie goers will find it a good enough diversion for 90 minutes. As for Britney fans (like myself) i'd off course be curious to see it, but i'll always be disappointed that it wasn't as strong a debut for her film career as it should have been.. she has obvious screen presence, and i think with the right film, she could win a huge amount of new older fans... it's hard though as her real-life persona will always interefere with the audience's pre-conception when coming into the film. Hopefully her and her team of people will learn from the mistakes of this film, and think more realistically towards a long term movie career for her, rather than just catering the fickle youngters, who gave the film 1/10 because she didn't get naked or sing 'Baby One More Time'.

Althouth this movie has been bashed by many people, I feel it is an excellent movie for its genre. Too many people expect too much out of so called chick flicks and they are so quick to shoot them down, but take some time out and think about what's happening in the movie and the messages it is providing to its viewers.

Not only won't it ever win an academy award or be in the running but it managed to distinguish itself by making the imdb list of worst movies of all time. No easy feat!That said-I'm a person who likes all types of movies from The Hours to 'Chicago to Ocean's eleven. And sometimes I like lightweight movies too. I'm not saying Crossroads was a work of incredible genius that will live on in all our minds for years to come.... Not at all-but cmon-with all the BAD movies out there(and there are MANY)  I don't think this pic deserves to be in the pile of worst movies EVER.What Crossroads was, is a sweet, light little piece of popcorn fluff sweetness and light movie(but not terrible) that also happened to star Brittney Spears THAT was the problem.I think the worst thing about Crossroads wasn't Crossroads at all-it was the fact that spears played the lead role. I'm gonna be honest here and say it straight out-BRITTNEY SPEARS IS A POP SINGER!!   If she wants to be an actress fine but nobody could watch a movie like this and take it at all seriously. And all the Britney singing in the backround didn't help.I'm sure the creators of Crossroads could have done this movie without promoting Britney's singing as well-if Ms. Spears wants to be an actress AND a singer fine-but don't try to be both in the same movie. Then the movie begins to look less like a movie then a vehicle for Spears to sell her albums, thus earning her yet another few million- which essentially it was.Now that said-I have to admit if SOMEONE else had starred in this movie-lets say it was crossroads starring Winona Rider I don't think people would have killed on it as much. I mean let's face it the movie wasn't just given no respect, it became something of a joke.  I really don't think that's because of the movie itself but because of Spears. Her character was sweet but she was played by a POP SINGER-so that took away believability  to her performance-for her first role she should have chosen something edgier I think.But on the plus side-I saw this with a few girlfriends and yes it really DID make me think girl power and make me  want to hug my friends afterward. And I want to stress I'm not under 18 nor have I ever bought or been tempted to buy anything by Brittney Spears in my life.  Plus as light movies go there have actually been alot worse.What turned me off most about this little buttercup of a movie was all the hype(as if we don't get enough) on Spears itself. This seemed less a movie then a work of vanity. If Spears wanst to prove herself as an actress she needs to make the audience forget she's a pop idol. And that just didn't happen.But the movie doesn't deserve to be cut down that much-like I said if Kate Hudson or Winona Rider had starred I don't think the movie would have garnered so much negative attention, though of coarse it'll never be exactly a classic.

The moment when she learns the tune to Not a girl, not yet a woman must be the greatest mistake on the movie. Still, despite the not-so-brilliant acting skill from Britney, the movie is pretty watchable. And it's pretty entertaining (even though you know from the start she's ending up with the bad guy). Fourth, Britney is a make money machine since she started her career. As a fan who loves her to death, I can admit that she's not the talentest singer out there. She has no lack of talent. What she has is an awful team behind her actions. She's like a doll in her hands. Believe me when I say she needs no auto-tune or to sing about dance clubs to sell music - Everytime, Not A girl, not yet a woman, Don't let me be the last to know, He about to lose me, or even the unreleased Everyday and Strangest Love are proofs of that. But her team musn't think that way, because they use auto-tune on her and... did this movie. Yes, this movie is a way of earning money thanks to Britney, because every fan of Britney will love this. I give 7 out of 10 to the movie, but only because I love the Princess of Pop.

I love watching this movie every so often when I want something simple, not to dramatic, not too romantic, not too anything but it's a nice little diversion and awake daydream type of feeling movie. I don't think Brit's acting was that bad. I've seen bad, hers was fine, not Oscar worthy but not bad, as a side note to all that say she can't sing, just b/c you don't like her singing doesn't mean she can't, her problem is that she lets her songs use too many synthesizers and crap. Heck Madonna can't sing, she really can't she got by on image alone, most anybody would tell you that. Yes the movie had a lot of cheesy moments but I liked that. I liked the idea of the girls re-bonding, the romance with the guy, I do think the whole pregnant, underage drinking thing was pointless. I realize they were trying to get some depth in there but please...look at the movie, why try to add depth to something that obviously is in no way going to pull it off they way it was intended.

Of course the script writing was not phenomenal and the acting was satisfactory; but still a cute little movie about three teenagers girls Lucy, Mimi and Kit who go on a road trip with Ben, a guy they just met to Los Angelas for a singing audition. The three girls are best friends from childhood who had grown apart, but end up rekindling their friendship through the troubles they surpass during the road trip their car breaks down, and they end up putting on a singing show at a local club to raise money to have it fixed. Lucy makes a stop in Arizona to meet her estranged mother, who she hasn't seen in 15 years because she had walked out on her and her father. Mimi is also pregnant with the baby of Kit's fianc√©, who had raped her in the backseat of his car (which of course Kit is unaware of.) Through conquering their own set of problems, the girls become reunited and close again, and, Ben ends up falling in love with Lucy. The only thing I can say bothered me the most about Crossroads was that Britney Spears (Lucy) was by far the best character of the three girls. She was the most successful, innocent, intelligent, and prettiest; also of course she is the one to save the day, and gets the cute guy in the end. Did Britney Spears help direct this movie? Because it sure seemed like it. Although it was largely one sided in this sense, the movie is still worth seeing if you're a fan of Britney Spears.

The plot is simple, three childhood friends, that have grown apart, reunite on prom night to go on a road trip. Pregnant trailer trash Mimi (Manning) is the driving force behind the escapade, as she wants to break out of her small town life by entering a singing contest. Popular rich girl Kat (Saldana) intends to pay a surprise visit to her older, college going Fianc√©, and A student Lucy (Spears) is in search of the mother that abandoned her. Possible murderer Ben (Mount) spices things up as the duty driver whose masculinity hilariously deteriorates in the midst of continual girl talk. Very soon he allows the girls control of the car stereo and is happily singing along with them.This is laughably corny in parts, shallow and often cringe-worthy. The directing is, at times, heavy handed, especially with the blue beer bottle scene. However all the performances are solid, with Spears being particularly charismatic on screen. Dan Aykroyd and Kim Cattrall deliver superb performances in supporting roles that give the film some added credibility. Obviously this is firmly aimed at young teenage girls and Britney Fans. It is a PG certificate and should perhaps be thought of as a children's film, as the clich√©d dialogue and lack of depth means there is little to engage adults. There is an abundance of opportunities for Britney to sing, as well as to show off her perfectly tanned and toned body. The early pink underwear scene is worth the price of the ticket alone.It seems as though there has not been such a warm hearted, yet naive and stereotypical teen film like this for quite some time. This is almost like a breath of fresh air, and has the feel of an 80's John Cusack or Hughes film (though not as good). It is blatantly predictable and sometimes wanders into the so bad it's good territory, but its warm and well meaning, and reminds us that being a teenager wasn't so bad. A great film to watch with your girlfriend, as long as she understands she will have to watch Dog Soldiers with you as pay back.

In no way a great movie, or even to be honest a good one, this is still endurable... though fans of the chirpy one have a head start.A vehicle for the modern-day Annette Funicello all the way, the movie has her and her two closest friends (Taryn Manning and Zoe Saldana, both of whom are, if you'll pardon the expression, Stronger in the acting department - but then again who's seeing this for the acting?) meeting up after graduation from high school and, with a new male acquaintance of one of the girls as chauffeur, heading from Georgia to California - Miss Manning to enter an open audition for a record company, Miss Saldana to see her fiance, and sweet little Britney to drop in on her mum in Arizona. Cue for much bonding, quarrelling and the odd song as they head out on the highway, looking for adventure and whatever comes their way...Which dramatically isn't that much, thanks to Sondra Rhimes's script; most of the major moments are thrown away (the most tragic moment on the journey doesn't carry the weight it should, and when Britney's character does meet her mother - Kim Cattrall, not the most plausible partner for Dan Aykroyd as our heroine's dad - it just doesn't work) and it all seems to be building up to the moments when the golden girl gets to do her thing, a theory underlined by the poetry she writes en route, which turns out to be the lyric for I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman. While I like the record, it's impossible not to find that laughable.SPOILER ALERT... SPOILER ALERT... SPOILER ALERT...Plus, she actually sings it at the most elaborate audition in history (do aspiring singers really get to try out for record labels in front of a packed audience? Even the dancers in the boring movie version of A Chorus Line played out their stuff to the director and the director alone). And it must be said that her formerly pregnant friend gets over the loss of her unborn child in an accident really quickly.SPOILER ALERT OVER... SPOILER ALERT OVER... SPOILER ALERT OVER...That's to be expected when a pop star has the lead in a film produced by her record company, however... though give them props for surprisingly not issuing a soundtrack album (perhaps because La Spears only has three songs - the aforementioned ditty, her karaoke take on I Love Rock'N'Roll, and Overprotected which she does over the end credits, complete with liveaction footage of her so doing intercut with outtakes from the movie - and most of Trevor Jones's score is unremarkable. Then again, who wouldn't want to find the words Britney Spears and the London Symphony Orchestra performing the score on the same CD?).Crossroads is shallow soft-centred stuff all the way, with our heroine sometimes surprisingly unflatteringly shot - you wonder if Christina Aguilera, Pink, Kelly Osbourne, Sheryl Crow and other female singers who've had a go at her of late served as uncredited executive producers - but it never pretends to be anything more than it is, it's not as weakly made as Mariah Carey's Glitter, and Britney is more endearing and less excruciating an actress than Madonna. In the end it's not really much of anything, and I say that as a fan of hers, but it's still okay if she was Born To Make You Happy ... and fans of Kylie Minogue (another singer who's ticked off Britney of late) might like to note that this is remarkably less crappy than Street Fighter or Neighbours.Plus I think I can safely say that a lot of Britney's male fans have given the pause and frame-by-frame capabilities on their videos/DVD players a good workout due to the first fifteen minutes.

I don't care what anyone says, I think she is one of the most beautiful, sexiest women I've ever seen, and seeing her in her undies was worth the entire movie.  Ok, with that said, I can continue with the review.The story in this film is nothing original, it's been done time and time again, so don't expect anything new and original here.  This is just a simple vehicle to get Britney on the big screen.  But, despite being a non-original story, it's still fairly good, and has some good stuff to it.The my surprise, Britney is a much better actress than I expected.  She did a very good job and I gotta giver her some credit.  The other cast members did a fine job as well.  Dan Akyroyd was a nice touch in the film, he did a great job playing Lucy's father and I was glad to see him in the film.  Kim Cattrall was also another good touch, she did a fine job with what little screen time she had.  The highlight of the film for me was Justin Long (from TV's ED) he is such a COOL actor and I'm always happy to see him in a film (and he got to KISS BRITNEY SPEARS!!!!!!!!!!!).  Anyhow, he was very good in his role, despite also having very little screen time.Ok...so, I've mentioned all the good things in the film...now here is what I didn't like...POTENTIAL SPOILERS AHEAD!Why is it that she couldn't have sex with her friend/boyfriend Henry (Justin Long) who she's known been buddies with for more than 3 years, is a completely sweet and honest guy, but CAN have sex with this guy Ben (Anson Mount), who she's only known for a week or two?  I guess I'm just rooting for the little guy, I'm sick of seeing the pretty-boy nice guy get the girl!  I want the good hearted nice guy to get the girl.  Oh well, I guess you can't win them all.END OF SPOILERSAll in all, I thought the movie was pretty good and was a fairly interesting story.  I wouldn't recommend this to everyone, but if you like Britney Spears, then give it a shot, don't have too high of expectations though.  Hope you enjoy the film, thanks for reading.-Chris "},{"Title":"Great movie with a teen side","Date":"2 August 2002","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Music","Review":"  The first time I saw this movie I thought it was a great movie and it can relate to most teenagers out there who lost a friend but gained them back.

I assumed that it would just be a piece of crap, but it wasn't. The overall theme of how true friendship lasts forever made me think of my best friend Toya and how we've been best friends since we were eight (we're 21 now.) Some of the scenes drew a tear to my eye. That was mostly from the acting of Zoe Saldana and Taryn Manning (who really deserved more screen time and shouldn't have been stuck in Britney's shadow). I'm sorry to say that I still feel that Britney Spears can't act.It was so obvious that the point of this film was a mere extension Britney's pop star fame. Britney-endorsed products (such as Pepsi and Herbal Essences) were flaunted about shamelessly. And let's not forget that most of the songs in the movie belong to Britney or other pop star acts (*cough* Nsync *cough*). This movie is self-advertisement at its worst. Also, Britney's portrayal of a virginal girl desperately trying to grow into a woman was pathetic. It's the same song and dance she's been trying to give us for the past 3 years and frankly, I'm tired of it. This movie was almost as scary as Mariah Carey's sad attempt at acting. I totally expected this to be a well-oiled Britney machine and it was. She claims the movie was supposed to be an ensemble piece, but for some strange and mysterious reason, Britney's character Lucy seems to be the center of attention.I'm sorry, but of all the pop stars breaking into acting lately (Britney, the aforementioned Mariah, Lance Bass, etc.), Mandy Moore seems to be the only one with any staying power. That girl acted her butt off in A Walk to Remember and can do so much better than Britney. If Britney plans on making anymore movies, I sure hope she has the cash to produce them, because it would be tantamount to disaster for a studio to back anymore of her films.

There were some really funny scenes and Ms. Spears' performance was less nerve wrecking than some of the so-called-professionals that are out there. She's never claimed to be a professional actress nor has she claimed that the movie should be nit picked and criticised in detail. It's a feel good movie, a 2 hour trip that takes your mind of the real world and see some young people have a good time. It's not supposed to be an intellectual workout. It was a good first movie for Spears and she did a good job as far as I'm concerned. The story is predictable, I'll give you that, but show me a teen movie that doesn't? For it's genre, it was a relatively good try. She had a good cast to support her performance and lead her to the right direction. It's cheesy, but in a good way. Let's face it, when Bodyguard premiered and Whitney Houston starred in her first movie, that was cheesy (and still is). But people still went to see it and had fun.

Mimi (Taryn Manning (Crazy/Beautiful) is pregnant and heading to a band audition in L.A.!The boy Ben (Anson Mount) is there mainly to look handsome for the girls and coincidentally to compose music for Lucy's poetry.  It all sounds fairly unpromising I know but Lucy and Mimi make a fairly weak script sing quite a bit at times. Things get pretty dramatic too in an offhand sort of way, to the extent that I thought for a moment that Mimi had gained her name from Puccini's La Boheme.That's no criticism either. Taryn Manning as Mimi adds quite a bit of bounce to film that could have been just a teenage homage to Britney. Crossroads has presented Britney Spears as an actress with a good deal of charm and a script that takes a surprisingly serious bent.3 Flys with Bared Navels Out Of Five.

It was Mimi. And I also think you all were correct in saying that I would not take any Britney fan to see this. I mean people expect that becasue Britney is in it they will tone it down because of all the little people that will go see it. And yet they don't.

But they are never mentioned in the same breath as Britney and her rival record company clones Christina, Jessica, and Mandy and what's more Brandy and Monica etc. were marketed/packaged as soul artists rather than pop princesses on account of being Black. The presentation/exposure is totally dependent on race. J.Lo is a rare crossover exception but she is older and past her expiry date like Brit. All the other ethnic groups are virtually shut out. The Lindsay, Hillary, Jo Jo pop princess class was again all-white. Most of these singers are clearly more dependant on marketing/packaging than on raw talent so I have to believe that it must be possible to groom a minority pop princess if record executives in the entertainment industry weren't so racist. When the next class comes around minorities must demand representation.

I'm not crazy about Britney anymore, either, but come on, guys! It was her first movie! Personally, I think she can act better than some of the top notch actresses! I think that if there's anybody in this movie who can't act, it's Taryn Manning, who plays Mimi. She shows no emotion whatsoever during the movie. Okay I said I was going to put spoilers in here, so here goes! Britney stars as Lucy, a small-town girl who lives with her overprotective father, who wants Lucy to be a doctor. Lucy, however, has a passion for singing. Lucy's mom left when she was three. Lucy has been trying all her life to get her father to reveal why she left, but he gets very touchy and defensive whenever Lucy brings the subject up. OK now I have to take you back in time to when Lucy, now 18, was 8 years old. She used to be best friends with Mimi and Kit. One night they dug a hole in a field, put things that represented their dearest wishes inside a shoebox and buried it in the hole, promising each other they'd always be best friends forever. They made a pact to dig the box up on the night of their high school graduation. The movie then skips to the day of their graduation, and we see that they are now as far from best friends as possible. Kit has become the most popular girl in school, Lucy is a nerd, and Mimi is a rebel, pregnant, and has therefore earned a reputation of being a trashy slut. Still, all three keep the pact and show up to dig up the box. Mimi tells Lucy and Kit about an audition for a record company in LA, that she is going with some guy, and invites Lucy and Kit to come along. Of course they both say no way, but Lucy sneaks out of the house at night, leaving a goodbye note to her father, to go. Kit also shows up. We see that there is an instant connection between Lucy and Mimi's guy, whose name is Ben. (He is not the father of Mimi's baby, however.) By this time we know that Kit is engaged to a guy named Dylan, and that she is going to see him in LA. To make a very long story short, we find out that Dylan is the father of Mimi's baby, then Mimi falls down a flight of stairs and loses the baby. (This is where I cannot believe the lack of emotion Taryn Manning displays.) Also, Kit scares Lucy and Mimi by telling them that Ben was once in jail for killing someone, (but we find that he was put in jail for basically nothing, I won't reveal what), Lucy finds her mom in Arizona, which is followed by a brilliant display of emotion from Britney. In the end, the girls are friends again and we see Lucy auditioning for the record company before the credits. This is an excellent movie and I encourage everyone to at least give it a chance.

Yes, Britney is a long way from Oscar-worthy but this is her first film and for the material provided, Spears more than provides a enjoyable experience for the viewer. The characters are a little too one-dimensional (Lucy's dad, Ben) but this film was made to appeal to a certain type of person. Crossroads is strictly for the under-16 crowd and girls who like a very girlie girl movie with a pop-star and singing/music. You don't need to be a Spears fan to like this film.

There seems to be two distinct classes of reviews for this movie those based on the movie, and those based on the reviewer's feelings toward Britney.  I suggest reading those of the first kind (so long as you can differentiate between the two) for two reasons the first is actually useful in judging what others though of the movie, and the second kind has no purpose since you probably already know what you think of Britney.Okay, time to get to my review of the movie...As many reviews have pointed out, the movie isn't bad, but isn't great either.  It's enjoyable and entertaining, but not particularly thought-provoking.  Yes, it's predictable, but there's comfort in consistency (that's why people tend to order the same thing every time they go to a fast food place), so that's not such a terrible thing in some respects.  No, Britney won't win an Academy Award, but to tell the truth, she's a fine, believable actress.  The other two main actresses do pleasant performances as well.  The main male actor is easy to watch and looks comfortable in his character, so no complaints there either.  Sure, you've seen these characters before in numerous other teen movies, but just think of the collection of teen movies as a sort of series (like the Jack Ryan books of Tom Clancy or Nancy Drew books) where you watch the newest film in the series to see what these favorite characters have gotten themselves into this time.  Don't watch it thinking it's going to blow your mind or spawn days of philosophical pondering in solitude; it's simply meant to be a fun movie that keeps you entertained for a couple hours.  If you allow yourself to, you might just find you like the film.Final suggestion Don't watch it with friends who don't like Britney unless you have the same opinion (their comments will most likely take away from the movie and make it impossible to watch unbiased).Thanks for reading my humble opinions.

Britney was fine and ultra engaging in a role not far removed from her music world persona; Zoe Saldana and Taryn Manning as her partners-in-crime fared well also, (although I could never quite get past the feeling that the characters had only ever been friends for the sake of the situation; i.e. Saldana and Manning never achieved any real chemistry with Britney, despite striking a rapport between themselves. Anson Mount as Ben provided the 'eye candy'; an effect that was lost on me being in the demographic the film wasn't setting out to aim for, (19 yo hetro white male,) but his performance was adequate enough and he achieved the requisite chemistry with Britney, (though I laughed at the artful taste of 'that scene' where a lot of fluttering sheets and whistling curtains replace what the world wanted to see and, I expect, what Britney knew we wanted to see.)Dan Aykroyd fared surprisingly well in a thankless sort of a role, while Kim Cattrall's cold-as-ice scene left me disappointed that more time couldn't have been used to posit an explanation for her coldness, (after all, if I remember rightly, she hung around until Lucy was three; what made her run off? Surely Dan Aykroyd couldn't have been THAT hard to live with...)The scene in which Ben writes some music for 'that poem you read me last night' contains what must be one of the film's funniest moments, when we are desperately persuaded that 'Not A Girl...' is a completely new song that has only just been conceived. I don't know what coverage there has been in other parts of the world, but I first heard the song before September 11, so the moment lacked that wonder for me.As far as musical numbers went, I thought that they were too 'realistic' to be impressive. I found particularly 'I Love Rock 'n Roll' wasn't any more impressive than a mediocre karaoke night. I felt that it would have been more effective had it broken out of the 'reality' of the story, (any good musical movie does this; think Woody Allen's 'EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU.')I enjoyed the movie a lot, don't get me wrong. I enjoyed stifling smirks at the blatant plugging of Pepsi, (apparently every gas station in America stocks and advertises Pepsi, while neglecting to display that other reasonably well-known and popular red coloured bottle,) and those bottles of Clariol Herbal Essences (I've got the urge!) I also appreciated the subtle advertising of that boy band that must have had some connection to either the director or one of the stars, I dunno...I will warn now I am biased in that I am a fan of Britney's stage persona, and thus found it engaging in this context. Although the other performances were fine, DON'T see it for that. If you find Britney irritating/annoying, save your $10 and see another music-based film out last year, 'MOULIN ROUGE.' Now I'm thirsty. Might go grab a Pepsi with a Clairoil chaser...BYE BYE BYE!**** out of 5.

I enjoy reliving those awkward moments in life and remembering what it was like some years ago. Crossroads is just like your typical teenage movie, with predictable plots and angst. I didn't go into the movie thinking it was going to be award winning, but I came out quite surprised. I enjoyed it more than I expected, even being a Britney fan (what can I say, the girl is beautiful!).She deserves some credit, as well as the other girls who took part.

Sure, she can sing, dance, whip males into a sexual frenzy, pull off the most revealing outfits, but can she act? It turns out, she can! She impressed me and I like Britney more than ever now. Although she was very good, I didn't think she was the best in the film. Zoe Saldana, who played the pretty, popular little madam Kit and Taryn Manning who played the pregnant, level-headed rock chick Mimi, blew me away. They were fantastic and the chemistry between the characters Kit, Mimi and Lucy (Britney's character) was great fun and very enjoyable to watch. Anson Mount, the mysterious driver Ben, was impressive. I haven't seen him in anything else before and although I didn't think he and Lucy fitted well together, the actor and the character were likeable.The only flaw was how the writers droned on about how Britney Spear's was a singer! We knew beforehand but every other scene was her singing, dancing, writing song lyrics and pretending it was poetry. I think Britney's very talented, both musically and in acting, I don't need any reminders! Some might say the film was predictable, and true, some bits were. Still there were twists and surprises.The overall film was a feel-good movie, it did have the cheesy lines and moments most films have, but it was fun and lively.

Contrary to what some people might say (y'all know who you are!), Britney is a capable actress. She's very natural, and she does not come across as trying hard. Although in some takes, she does tend to falter a bit. Anson Mount is definitely a hunk and a half! Likewise though, there are some scenes wherein you just want to hit him in the head for a deeper emotion. Zoe Saldana was great as the bitchy highschool princess while the girl playing Mimi (sorry, I forgot her name)was lagging a little on the acting wagon. Dan Aykroyd would have made quite an impact on the film if he was given a bigger part. As it is, we only see snippets of him throughout the flick. Kim Catrall is a good actress but was not given much time in the film. It would have been good if there was a big confrontation scene between Lucy and her mom. So, as a rating?

I'm sorta a Britney Spears fan, but, as time goes on, I'm sorta getting a little sick of her whole image thing about how we all must accept the fact that she's not a girl but not yet a woman. It's really growing thin. I think, we all know that she's definitely no young girl! WE CAN ALL SEE THAT. But anyway, I'm going off track here. Crossroads is a movie going into I know I wouldn't like. Why do you ask? Because, to be completely honest, exactly how good can a film starring Britney Spears be? And secondly, why would I even want to go see a movie where I know I won't like it? That's because 2002 is shaping into a year of dreck. There's not one good film that has started to come out.  Crossroads I think will please it's target audiences. I'm guessing young 12 - 16 (?) year old girls. Other people who bash this film had, to be honest, no business going to see this movie. Yeah it's true, I didn't care for the film very much, but, I don't like reading or listening to older people who are already against Britney Spears bash the film. If you dislike the lead star so much, there's very little chance you'll give yourself a chance to enjoy it. As you watch the film the whole time you'll be critical of what your seeing. I on the other hand, wanted to like it. I wanted to be able to fully defend it. I wanted to be able to say Britney Spears deserves more attention than what she's getting, I can only mildly defend her and this movie. And I only defend her because I'm a fan of her music, not so much the film itself. I just like her, for her, nothing more nothing less.  Crossroads lags. It really is kinda boring. The viewer isn't drawn into these characters enough to honestly care about what happens to them. Sure, we can say this is a sad movie, and when certain tragic events happen we can for that moment say,Awwwwwww, I don't know what I would do if that was me?, but 99% of the time, we only say these things because we're not heartless. Crossroads coulda been a good movie. There were themes of date rape, peer pressure that young girls face in losing their virginity, and self discovering. All elements that some very good films have dealt with. Crossroads chickens out. And for this we blame not Spears, but scriptwriter Shonda Rhimes.  Because of undevelopped characters and awful pacing I can't say I enjoyed this movie. Do I think everyone will dislike this film? No. I think it's target audience will enjoy. And they should. I'm giving it ** out of **** or a 5 on a scale of 1-10.

I'd like to ask those folks if they like Ms.Spears AT ALL. Do they bob their heads when Oops I did it again comes on the radio? Do they read the interesting in-depth articles in Rolling Stones about her? I have a theory that they do not. There are folks out there that hate whenever anybody gets very popular, no matter how talented or deserved, and I suspect that these reviewers are letting that bias their reviews of this film. Now don't get me wrong, Crossroads is no Shakespeare production, but it is a cute, and fun film that if you can go into it with an open mind, will surprise you.The plot is simple. Three little girls bury a box filled with dreams, and vow to dig it up on their high school graduation night. During that time, the girls grow apart, but they do return to dig up the box from their childhood. This sets the movie in motion to take the girls across the U.S. on a road trip with a guy they barely know in search of (among other things), a recording contract, a missing mother, and a distant fiancee. Sure, some of the situations are predictable, but so what? I haven't been to a movie in YEARS that hasn't had SOME degree of predictability in it's plot. The dialogue is realistic and charming. And the three principle actresses, Zoe Saldana as Kit, Taryn Manning as Mimi (looking like a modern Soleil Moon Frye from Punky Brewster), and yes, miss Britney Spears as Lucy are all excellent in their roles, and become characters you quickly care about and want to see the best happen to. Also good is Anson Mount as Ben, the token guy throughout this cross country trip. I particularly liked the scene where he said that his car was the one thing not taken over by women yet. Being a guy who's always managed to have more female friends than male friends, I've been in his shoes many a time! ^) Dan Aykroyd was also good in his role as Britney's single father, although I did keep having Ghostbusters flashbacks whenever he was on screen, but that's just me...Although most folks are calling this a comedy, it's not a laugh out loud film. It's not meant to be. It's more of a romantic, adventurous, Dramedy if you want to be exact.And as a final comment to all the naysayers out there... Remember a man named Mark Wahlberg? When his first film came out, wasn't everybody putting HIM down, saying he was nothing more than a flash-in-the-pan pop/rap star? He did record those songs Good Vibrations and Wildside with the Funky Bunch, if you recall. Now look at him. Great roles in Renaissance Man, the Basketball Diaries, Boogie Nights, Three Kings, the Perfect Storm and others have elevated him to revered acting status.I can't help but wonder if a similar career awaits Britney. If so, more power to her, there's nobody more deserved! ^)    "},{"Title":"It really IS a good movie","Date":"19 February 2002","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Music","Review":"  I saw this movie a couple days ago with a few other friends.

When this film came out I was interested in seeing how she would do in a full length film.  I can honestly say I was surprised by how well she did and how good the movie was.For her first performance in a movie, she did fantastic.  Let us all not forget how horrible some of our favorite stars did in their first films. I would recommend this film to everyone and anyone.  The film had the right mix of acting and singing, and it was hilarious to see Dan Akroyd back in a major motion picture.  He was awesome, and watching this movie made me want to go home and pop in The Great Outdoors, and awesome Dan Akroyd movie.I went to go see this film with my fiancee, and even though he kicked and dragged every inch of the way to the theater, he thought that the movie was great. Don't let your taste in music get in the way of seeing this film. His favorite bands are metallica and Godsmack, mine are Bush and Limp Bizkit and we both loved the film!So just in case any of the actors of the film see this, you all did awesome, don't let the negative feedback get to you!

Britney need not worry about any Mariah Carey Glitter comparisons- Crossroads is not the mess that movie was at all.  Crossroads IS what it is... a teen road movie.  Parents with children under the age of 10-12 might want to skip this one for a few years.  Britney loses her virginity (not on screen), gets a little drunk, and even says a few curse words.  These are the things that actually make the movie more realistic.  Kim Cattrall literally has one two minute scene- why on earth she agreed to do this flick is beyond me.  She plays the woman who abandoned Britney at age 3, leaving Dan Aykroyd to raise Britney's character as a single Dad. No wonder Britney wanted to hit the road.Her co-stars turn in good, solid performances.  Although I'm happy that I got free passes to see a sneak preview- I wouldn't have felt that paying for a matinee of this flick would have been a ripoff.

Personally, I enjoyed it, and was surprised at how sad it was. It was never meant to be an Oscar winner, or even be a critical darling, but it was made for Britney and for her fans. The movie itself is about a trio of girls that have grown apart, and grow close together again while going on a road trip. The acting is genuine, but a little stiff . Britney is not a bad actress, and this acting is far superior than some would like you to believe.The chemistry between the cast is good and it shows in the movie. If you HATE Britney Spears, well then obviously you aren't really gonna like a movie that was made for her. If you do happen to like Britney, then you most likely have already seen this movie, and thusly formed your own opinion.The movie does have many faults, and it's plot is kind of rushed and lethargic. Crossroads kinda lays it all on at the end, with a lot of bad things happening, that it seems kind of unbelievable.The movie tries to tackle too many issues that affect teenage girls, and it works to an extent...but it also comes across a little sappy.The thing that I really liked about the movie though, are the characters and the people that played them. Zoe Saldana, Anson Mounts, Taryn Manning, and Britney Spears really make the movie, and they were really the only characters that matter. I know the movie has limited appeal, but it's unfair to call it awful or the worst movie ever just because Britney Spears is in it and many people can't take her, and thusly this movie, seriously.I guess the bottom line is that if you like Britney, you may like it; if you don't care about her, then you won't care about this movie; and if you loathe her, you will loathe this movie.

Mariah Carey sucks at acting yes, Britney really doesn't. She's not a very experienced actress and she's not all that talented, but I've seen worse. She was believable and I actually enjoyed watching her play the part, so please cut the girl some slack! Don't think I'm a huge Britney Spears fan or anything, because let's face it she's not all that talented. Not when it comes to acting and not when it comes to singing.Second of all I think the entire reason critics and other people talked so bad about this movie was Britney. Just because she is in it, people paid more attention to it and they did everything they could to point out the bad things. Personally, I don't think that's fair, because the movie really isn't that bad.Third of all The love-story between Ben and Lucy was kind of sweet! He might be older than her, but...who cares?! They are sweet together and unbelievable story-lines like this occur in every movie, but somehow because Britney is in this movie, people say things about it, which brings me back to my previous point.So, basically the movie isn't that, Britney isn't that bad and it's just a nice movie to watch when there's nothing else on.

I was entertained thoroughly seeing this movie. I think most of these negative reviews are coming from anti-Britney fans who didn't even bother to see the film and are just saying that Britney Spears is a terrible actress, which she is not. CROSSROADS is a film about friendship, hope, loyality, and finding yourself. In CROSSROADS, we meet Lucy (Britney Spears), Kit (Zoe Saldana - CENTER STAGE), Mimi (Taryn Manning - CRAZY/BEAUTIFUL), and Ben (Anson Mount - newcomer). Lucy, Kit, and Mimi were childhood best friends, but in high school, grew apart from each other and went their own separate ways. Lucy is the smart, valedictorian. Kit is the popular girl. And Mimi is known as the bad, trashy girl. After graduation, Lucy, Kit, and Mimi get back together and decide to go on a road trip to California. Lucy wants to find her mother (she lives with her very overprotected father, played by Dan Aykroyd), who lives in Arizona. Kit wants to see her fiance. And Mimi wants to become a singer. They hitch a ride with the mysterious Ben, whom Lucy falls in love with, and he comes along for the ride. Yes, there is teen drinking and some swearing in the film, and even a little love scene (they really only take off their shirts in that scene) and a few kisses. But basically that's it. It's not as bad as it seems. Plus, if you're really worried about your children seeing this, they rated it PG to be on the safe side. Even the script is okay, because the characters in this film are not perfect people leading perfect lives--they all have different problems that they have to resolve by the end of the movie. And let's face it we are going to have to deal with teen pregnancy, teen drinking and doing drugs, but I don't think CROSSROADS encourages any of it. And, I personally think Britney Spears is a great actress, singer, dancer, and role model. She doesn't give up on her dreams even though she knows there are tons of people out there always making remarks about her and dissing her and everything. That's why I think Britney's a great role model...not because of her clothes or the way she looks. You may disagree with me but this is just my opinion. Also, another thing don't ever listen to professional critics because they always bash teen movies--just look at what they did to Mandy Moore's A WALK TO REMEMBER and Mariah Carey's GLITTER--and I thought those were both excellent movies, too! So my whole point is, go see CROSSROADS. You don't need to be a Britney fan to enjoy this movie. I am not the hugest Britney fan, but I do appreciate her, respect her as a person, and I like her music. I can't wait for the DVD of CROSSROADS--I hope there will be some great special bonus features! See CROSSROADS and you won't be disappointed.

I mean, I consider myself a girl with a good head on her shoulders, and also a little too old to fall into the traditional marketing scheme that this movie obviously is. Honestly, I expected it to be awful, I mean, truly awful.  I was dragged to it with MORE than low expectations, and was pleasantly surprised.  For one thing, this movie deserves cuteness points.  It really is the most precious thing I've seen in a while, and that's saying a lot, considering I do most of my TV watching with the 4 and under crowd.  But, Crossroads definitely had some cinematic merit as well.  While it was a little predictable, for my part, that only served to make me feel smart and on top of things.  The characters were pretty classic stereotypes, but not too over done, and made the movie easier to identify with, in the same sense as a farce is easy to laugh at because you know what to expect from the characters before they even open their mouths.  I did find myself rolling my eyes at some of the scenes, and the way that the director chose to convey some of his messages, but overall, the content of the movie wasn't horrible. My biggest complaint, however, is the focus on sex in this movie.  Now, I don't want to sound like an over protective mother (or grandmother) because I'm not, I'm a 16 year old girl and I like a good sex joke as much as the next teen, but the way sex was portrayed in Crossroads was still a little unsettling.  On the one hand, the dangers of unprotected sex, and sex too soon were addressed with Mimi's character, a pregnant teen.  But, on the other, 30 minutes into the movie, Britney and her lab partner are trying to loose their virginity, just so they won't be losers.  While she doesn't loose it then, Britney's character DOES make a big deal about having sex later.  I know it sounds old fashioned and stuffy, but that 4 and under crowd I was talking about earlier really tend to look up to people like Britney Spears, and I'm afraid that the whole sex subplot might have been a bad idea.  On the one hand, it's not so bad (I mean it IS a PG-13 movie, and it's just sex), but on the other hand, for most of the movie, Britney's character is the OBVIOUS role model (And when I say obvious, I mean it. She was the nice one, the grounded one, the good one, the talented one, the VALEDICTORIAN for crying out loud!) , and then she goes and does the deed. As a teenager, it doesn't bother (or even really phase)me, but if I was a mother (or even had a little sister) I might be really bothered by that. It was like Britney's character couldn't REALLY be happy or fulfilled until she wasn't a virgin any more.  I mean, why did that matter in the first place?

It's actually a great film!","Date":"16 February 2002","Score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Music","Review":"  I was a little skeptical going into Crossroads.  When Britney Spears in the star, you know you're going to be surrounded by teeny-boppers.  Yet, the movie really wasn't one for this pre-teen crowd.  I think that viewers really have to be in high school to at least have some understanding of the film.When I was in my senior year of high school a movie called Can't Hardly Wait hit theaters.  The movie depicts a high school graduation and the summer following.  I remember looking at this film and thinking, how do they know exactly what I'm going through?  Because everyone does, and the whole process of growing up really occurs between the ages of 18-22, that's the time when we discover who we really are and what we really want out of life. Crossroads has a lot of the same themes.I'm 21 and a senior in college- graduating in May!  And, even though Crossroads depicts a group of friends who have just graduated from high school, the feelings are the same.  People seem to make fun of the lyrics, I'm not a girl but not yet a woman...  But it's so true and real. Whether coming out of high school or college, it's like Oh My God, that's the real world!  But the truth is, I'm not a girl, I'm not a kid, but at the same time, I'm not a grown-up yet either.  Yet, come May I'll be looking for a real job in the real world.  And, now's the time when I think and try to figure everything out.  Sifting through my fears and hopes and dreams and trying to find who I am and where I'm going.  And meanwhile realizing that I didn't get any more out of college than an education- I didn't ever really have fun or just act wild or let myself go.  This movie makes me want to get a group of friends together and take a crazy roadtrip!To the pre-teen crowd, sure the song sounds silly.  And the same crowd (especially the young boys) are thrown by Britney's belly shots and dancing in her underwear.  But these kids have no concept of many of the mature themes in the film- drinking, rape, sex.  I can't see taking a ten year old to this film and having to explain what happened to Mimi and how she got pregnant.Anyway, I just wanted to tell everyone- DON'T LET BRITNEY FOOL YOU!  The film has a powerful message and explores all the fears and desires we all experience during the real years of growing up.

Basically three best friends in childhood get together and bury a box to open for a pact, they will open it at midnight the day they have graduated high school. Of course when they have grown up and are attending high school, Lucy Wagner (Razzie winning Britney Spears), Kit (Zo√´ Saldana) and Mimi (Taryn Manning) have parted ways, but they do keep their pact, opening the box and striking up a conversation. One of the girls says she plans to go to a record contract singing audition, so they decide to all go on a road trip together to get there, with a guy named Ben (Anson Mount) driving, and not much money. They suspect Ben killed someone and went to prison for it, but he straightens things out, and they earn some much needed money with Lucy singing. On the way to the audition, Lucy also visits mother Caroline (Kim Cattrall) who she hadn't seen for years, only to be told she was an accidental and originally unwanted child. Of course Lucy's father Pete (Dan Aykroyd) isn't happy with everything she has been up to, and tries to make sure she is back home, but in the end he lets her get on with her own thing, and they do reach the audition in the end.

You can't help but like Spears in the leading role, and her singing in the film comes in handy too, I will admit some of the film is cheesy and more for the teenage and girlie audience, but it is a fine comedy drama (near road movie).

I used to really like my ex girlfriend Shelley and even brought some night vision goggles so that I could watch her when she was asleep. But she got this court injunction taken out, and her dad's an ex Royal Marine who told me that &#145;I wasn't right in the head' and had to leave her alone.Actually, when I say that he told me that, I really mean that he inferred it by punching me out of her bedroom window and into their greenhouse. The guy's an idiot! I could easily have climbed down the rope I'd used to get in. This film is all about the lovely, friendly, talented and beautiful Brittany Spears and some others who drive to LA and have adventures along the way. Sometimes, Brittany doesn't wear many clothes. The reason that I love Brittany is that I know she loves me and we will get married. How do I know? Well, I'm not some crazy fan who just thinks she does, I had a dream about it. But it wasn't a normal dream, it was a very vivid dream, almost like our minds had merged and we were &#145;as one'. Sometimes I dress like Brittany as well.I am glad that this film is unpopular, as I don't want other people looking at Brittany. She's mine.

I was so surprised that not only did she show the best of her singing and acting talents in Crossroads but she did it quite well.Crossroads is a cutesy movie about 3 young friends who make a pact to review their lives at midnight on the day of their graduation from HS.  By the time graduation rolls around, they have out grown one another.  Each is at a crossroad in their life.  They get a gorgeous hunk only one of them knows to drive them cross country in pursuit of answers.I loved the fact, despite 2 girls are white and 1 black, that there was no mention of race or any prejudices in the movie.  It was a story that treated everyone pretty equal, except they played Britney up as the lead singer.  I don't know why viewers rated this movie poorly.  It was a nice semi-quasi, escape from the fast pace, violence, and sex we see all the time.  Basically, it is a feel good movie and Britney was pretty good.

After I watched the full 93 minute movie from beginning to end, I couldn't help but think Well this isn't THAT bad. Yeah, it is really cheesy in some sorts and kinda dim-witted but it wasn't that bad of a movie. I know the thought of the incredibly hot Britney Spears playing a shy, valedictorian, good girl is kinda odd to see but hey its Hollywood. I thought it was kinda odd seeing Chris Evans playing two marvel characters in the human torch and captain America but like I said its Hollywood. Well anyway back to Crossroads, this movie wasn't that bad. I was entertained and I thought the ending was kinda good.

I was taken aback to see what a low rating it received on IMDb. Britney was surprisingly talented as an actor. She was very natural. Her friends played their roles perfectly.I'm a Woody Allen fan, and for those of you who are too (though I somehow doubt too many Woody fans will be reading this review), watch this movie and look for the scene where Britney and her nerdy lab partner are about to lose their virginities (preemptively) and the guy douses himself with baby-powder... that scene is a nod to the scene in Woody Allen's Bananas, and the kid even stammers and jokes in a very Woody Allenesque sort of way. So that makes me think that there were decent writers behind this script- hence it's a good movie.The movie is also genuinely funny. The plot is very cohesive, and the dialogue is very real. I am not ashamed to say I liked this movie. It was better than most movies that are put out today- which are lame, clich√©, wannabe indie pieces of trash. This movie will probably go down in cult coming-of-age film history.

(Fact=Anson Mount wasn't sure about doing a Britney movie but Robert DeNiro said 'Why Not? She's Great!' and he decided to do it!=Robert's a Britney fan!)         It's quite enjoyable, some bits are funny even when they're not meant to be!-like the 'sad' bits. I think if Britney does some more movies, with good writers and directors she could be a modern day Doris Day or Marilyn Monroe! She has a strong prescence about her. In some scenes of this movie there is a resemblance to Marilyn Monroe about Britney. There's a similarity that people like Madonna and Crossroads director Shonda has said on film, that she looks and acts like Marilyn.          Britney will next be seen in Nascar movie Trading Paint which she's producing, and is in talks to star in X-Men 3, the next Die Hard (as Bruce Willis' daughter!) and the movie version of Dukes Of Hazzard as Daisy Duke alongside Ashton Kutcher and Paul Walker.

The other cast members are great too, Zoe Saldana gives a truly powerful performance and was definitely the star of the film.I think the reason for the low rating is because of Britney spears. The minute this movie came out people got the idea into their head that Crossroads was going to be a bad attempt into making Britney a triple threat. News Flash Britney was ALWAYS a triple threat and this movie just proves her potential. Yes, no one can deny that Crossroads was used as publicity for Britney's 2002 album but if you just look beyond that, there is so much more to this movie!!

There should be at least one movie that depicts such perfect mixture of civilization, wilderness, adventure, and carefree life, and this one is it. This is early part of Britney Spears' career, and she's beautiful. She heads to Tucson to see her mother, but her mother already has another family, and she's not exactly welcomed. So she goes back to her friends. She's heartbroken, but consoled by her friends, she carries on. Then she find that music is her true calling.This movie might be getting low ratings unfairly because Brtney Spears is the star, but it's really a good movie, and the producers did a quality production that aged well. One caveat is that I'm in agreement with what the father said, because the way they did things were haphazard, and would have been dangerous. It would have ended up in one sort of trouble or another (which they did).Even if you're not a Britney Spears fan, this is a good movie to see, and if you are a Britney Spears fan, then this is a must see for sure.

The night of graduation, they open the box and they strike up a conversation. All of a sudden, one brings up the topic of her going to Los Angeles for a record contract audition. They all decide to go together and they leave. With a little money, they set out on the road with a guy named Ben. When one of them tells the other a rumor that he might be a homicidal maniac they are all scared of him. When they reach LA, Lucy (Britney Spears) falls in love with Ben and against her father's wishes, she stays and she goes to the audition.This isn't going to win any awards, it has many flaws, but come on, they were aiming for a nice feel good movie, and I felt they did an adequate job of it. Britney wasn't great, but she certainly didn't stink up the screen either. Its obvious bias towards people you hate half of the time, why should that reflect your views on the movie? It's a road movie, Britney made it for fun, and you put it on the bottom 100 list? Bit much if you ask me. I liked the emotion riding from the scene where Britney and her Mom encountered, it was emotional and saddening. I also thought Britney, Zoe, and Manning had great chemistry with each other. It's far from a great movie, but it has its moments, give it a break.Performances. Britney Spears should never be confused with an Emmy award winning actor, but she held her own for a first timer performer. She's likable, cute as a button, and managed to convince. That was more then enough for me. Zoe Saldana is gorgeous, but her character really pushed my buttons. Her It's all about me Really rubbed me the wrong way. She did a good job though. Taryn Manning has the best character here. She goes into darker territories with herself, and she did a convincing job. Dan Arkoyd appears in a few scenes, and felt out of place. Justin Long appears in a role i'm sure he likes to quickly forget.Bottom line. It's a decent movie, and dare I say rather fun? I will indeed. I have seen a lot worse then this, believe me.

It is by no means a classic or even average for that matter but I think a lot of the vitriol for this film has to do with Britney Spears being the star. For whatever reason many people resent her. Many do so because they perceive that she has marginal talent and has only been given the opportunities she has because of her undeniable good looks (I think her vocal prowess could be better but she is a commanding stage performer; then again would anyone buy her albums if she didn't look the way she does?) All that aside, I think this film will also have considerable less mass appeal because it has been so intensely targeted towards girls in the 10-17 age group. It is difficult for other members of the viewing public to identify with the three main characters. I don't fall into the target audience but I thought Britney did a fair job given the material she had to work with. I think the film could've been improved if they trimmed or eliminated some of the other story lines and focused more on Britney's. For instance it would have been interesting to actually see her mother in essence reject her instead of just the aftermath to that event. My score 5/10.
