Don Rickles is also good during a scene where he takes the mike and rips into the kids. There is so much zaniness going on here, much more than the movies that came before or after it in this series.

For once, the script is actually funny, not just stupid, and the presence of Buster Keaton, Timothy Carey and, of course, Harvey Lembeck as Von Zipper, adds a lot to the camp value and a very young Linda Evans adds her own exotic beauty.Annette looks great, Frankie even seems to have a tan and the late, great, John Ashley adds to the fun.This isn't Shakespeare, but the script is clever, and this probably has the best songs in the series, with the great Les Baxter actually having a hand in the songs and their arrangements in addition to his usual scoring duties.By all means catch this one if you like the series, and if you aren't familiar with it, I would recommend starting here.

Having watched three such films in quick succession, I have to agree it's not that those concerned made a concentrated effort at creating something more accomplished than before, but just that all the various elements (while others were dropped or altered) seemed to be more evenly balanced here to produce a generally more satisfying result. Incidentally, not only is the script wittier than usual &#150; but even the songs are kinda pleasant this time around&#133; Plotwise, we still get Frankie (Avalon) and Annette (Funicello) bickering &#150; but, rather than because one of them is being 'preyed' upon by an interloper, both of them are in this case (and, coming via members of a skydiving troupe who're supposed to instruct the Beach gang in just that type of sport, creates a few welcome sparks of high-flying tension). As always, the manager of the exciting but potentially dangerous 'entertainment' is played by Don Rickles &#150; whose character name, or moniker, has gone from Jack Fanny in MUSCLE BEACH PARTY to Big Drag in BIKINI BEACH (both 1964) to Big Drop in this one! Annette's fling, then, is John Ashley (usually seen as a surfer!) while Frankie's is spunky Deborah Walley (whom I recently watched in the Elvis Presley vehicle SPINOUT 1966) &#150; since Ashley and Walley were married to one another at the time, I guess this is why they made the former a rival to Frankie instead of a pal for this particular entry! Another important change in the nonsensically-titled BEACH BLANKET BINGO (by the way, exuberant dancing blonde Candy Johnson &#150; easily the most resistible element in the two earlier films from the series that I watched, is nowhere to be seen in this one!) concerns the character played by Jody McCrea while his nickname has unaccountably gone from Deadhead to Bonehead, he's now given two separate romances (which means that his former grating comic relief persona has been considerably diluted). The first involves singing starlet Linda Evans (miles removed from her signature role in the 1980s TV series DYNASTY!), ostensibly engaged in a skydiving stunt to promote her current record but actually doubled by Walley, and the other with real mermaid Marta Kristen, who's really the one that saved McCrea from drowning but the feat is once again attributed to the na√Øve but spoilt Evans by her conniving and sardonic manager Paul Lynde! While we do get an appearance from another screen giant here &#150; comic genius Buster Keaton, then going through a much-deserved renaissance &#150; this is rightly credited at the very start instead of relegated to the end credits, since it's a relatively bigger role than either of Peter Lorre's or Boris Karloff's cameos (one in each of the previous Beach Party films I'd checked out). Even so, his character could have been better integrated into the plot &#150; since, playing Rickles' girl-chasing assistant, he's not given anything particularly inspired to do it's fitting, for instance, that Keaton be involved in the speeded-up chase towards the end (by now a typical component of the series intended to mimic the style of Silent comedies)&#133;but the same can't be said of his cavorting with a trio of anonymous-looking girls during the final credit roll! Two welcome presences (actually both returns from previous entries in the series, though allowed greater stature than before) are those of Harvey Lembeck as Eric von Zipper &#150; self-pitying leader of the motorcycle gang The Rat Pack(!), who idolizes Evans to the point of kidnapping her &#150; and Timothy Carey as the nasty South Dakota Slim (though, regrettably, without his werewolf companion from BIKINI BEACH it's strange how this actor brings such intensity to his portrayals that he seems to be permanently on acid or something&#133;and this goes for mainstream fare as well, such as CRIME-WAVE 1954, which I watched just a few days prior to this one). By the way, both these actors are involved in the film's two biggest belly-laughs engaged in a billiards game at a pool-hall &#150; already featured in BIKINI BEACH, its walls are adorned by portraits of notorious dictators! &#150; and, with Lembeck taking forever to make his next move, Carey acidly quips that he's shaved twice since von Zipper's last shot!; the latter, then, enters a trendy nightclub by smashing through the front door on his motorcycle (as is Lembeck's fashion) &#150; only to land, in this particular case, head first in an aquarium! Besides, the element of surrealism which surprisingly entered the series with BIKINI BEACH is also present here in the form of the fanciful mermaid subplot as well as von Zipper's ghastly yet amusing fate during the climax at a sawmill (which, again, evokes the cliff-hanging serials from the Silent era).

It's like commenting on Citizen Kane or 2001 - too daunting. First of all, along with the COMPLETELY regular cast, it's one of the ones with Don Rickles. People have said that he just doesn't come across well in anything that's SCRIPTED for him, but that's far from completely true. Just watch for the little moment with him, after Frankie does his skydiving - it's a classic Don Rickles moment. And Paul Lynde could always be funny, with or without a script (most recently, fans of Roger the alien on American Dad are interested in him). One of his best lines is when Earl Wilson - who looks like the most straight-laced person in the world - wants to visit the surfers' hangout a second time. Lynde says, Which girl is it, Earl? And then there are Jody MacCrea (sp.) and Marta Kristen in the Lorelei subplot. Anyone who's seen brooding movies like Night Tide might like this mainly COMICAL mermaid story (not that it's the first or last one, of course). And of course, Timothy Carey as South Dakota Slim, who steals Sugar Kane from Erich Von Zipper, after Von Zipper went to the trouble of kidnapping her himself! Anyway, these are just SOME of the things going for it. The only thing missing from this beach movie is the cameo - I've always wondered why that is.

Everyone including the before-mentioned couple now wants to skydive and they hook-up with Don Rickles as the head of the skydiving company. Rickles is even able to throw in a mini-standup routine where he puts down everyone in the audience, as is his usual shtick. In a sidestory, the character Bonehead encounters a mermaid which brings a little variety and fun to the storyline. I hate to say it, but that's about it for this movie in a nutshell. A few songs are thrown-in(some better than others), plenty of booty-shaking, and a silent episode with Buster Keaton(playing a kind of Benny Hill-like character) adds to the light-hearted fare.

There was a long line of films from studios that featured teen idols and popular singers. While several became classics like The Beatle's A Hard Day's Night, many became forgotten as outdated light comedy with the occasional hidden adult humor. The entire era for T.V. and film were filled with this kind of stuff that may be funny for children but bore the heck out of adults.Frankie and Annette made quite a few of these Beach Party movies during the beach fad. Pretty much every one of them is the same story recycled with a few changes. This is just Frankie and Annette and friends having a good time while a B-level pop star uses the kids as a chance to gain publicity to advance her career while another one meets up with mythology come to life. Skydiving is also on the menu.The movie isn't bad and pretty much everyone comes out as likable Frankie, Didi, Bonehead, and Havey Lembeck's painful go as Erich Von Zipper; an English-mangling German biker. Paul Lynde plays himself practically and actually is pretty good. Buster Keaton, however, is a tragedy. The greatest silent film star from the U.S. is reduced to playing a dirty old man. Don Rickles was cracking the same tired material in 1965 that he uses today. Still, the women look great, the guys actually look like they belong, and the songs are decent.

Then, in the very next scene, as Von Zipper and the Rats enter the nightclub, he says Stand aside everyone, I take large steps! My jaw dropped a bit. Both of these are direct quotes from A FUNNY THING HAPPENED ON THE WAY TO THE FORUM, which had opened a little over a year earlier on Broadway! Late in Act One Miles Gloriosus, a Roman Soldier (Ron Holgate) announces his entrance by shouting, from offstage Stand aside everyone, I take large steps!, which cues the music for his song, which includes the lyric I am my ideal! Is William Asher paying homage to Sondheim and Burt Shevelove (who wrote the book for FORUM)? Is it an inside joke? Or is it just plain old-fashioned plagiarism?

While there are plenty of similarities, there were some differences that I appreciated like seeing Annette actually deciding to go skydiving with Frankie instead of trying to talk him out of it like she tried to in BB when it was about drag racing and also that Frankie, while initially not wanting Dee Dee (Annette's character) to do such a dangerous stunt, liked her even more when she did. Also, Jody McCrea's Bonehead-who was too stupid for my tastes in BB-is quite touching here with his romance with the mermaid Lorelei (Marta Kristen). I especially found funny the way he measured her body for a dress and the way she said, Do it again! There's also some amusing physical bits from Buster Keaton, some witty lines from Paul Lynde, another nice song from Donna Loren, a couple of good duets from Frankie and Annette, a pretty good solo from Frankie (though I wonder why Annette didn't have one this time around), and a charming number from Harvey Lembeck as Eric Von Zipper with his rat gang. Lembeck himself is hit-or-miss with his shtick though Timothy Carey provides some hilarity as occasional nemeses, South Dakota Slim. Then there's Linda Evans as singer Sugar Kane (did writer/director William Asher intentionally steal that name from Marilyn Monroe's character in Some Like it Hot?). Her innocent sexiness comes through in each of her scenes especially when she gets kidnapped by Von Zipper and says Marvey when he teaches her to play pool (Puss and Boots also provide some amusement when they make fun of her). And her mouthing the singing of Robin Ward sure fooled me! That said, Beach Blanket Bingo is only slightly better than Bikini Beach as once again, Don Rickles seems wasted here even when he's allowed to do a brief insult act in front of Frankie and the gang. Deborah Walley faking a rape was also pretty tastless here. And the speeded-up chase at the end is only slightly more amusing here due to Keaton and some water gags done on Lembeck. And I wish the Bonehead/Lorelei romance had ended like Splash but I guess that wasn't to be since Bonehead would appear in another sequel. All that said, I enjoyed Beach Blanket Bingo a little more than Bikini Beach and seeing Buster and dancer Bobbi Shaw at the end with some other girls doing their moves marked a very cute way to end this silly A.I.P. beach movie musical...

Odd because these movies put an end to his dominance of the Malibu surf as hordes of surfer wannabes flooded to the beach, inspired, in large part, by these movies. Another extra is Beach Boy supreme, Brian Wilson. Another oddity because the movie plugs the contrived band, the Hondells, while Wilson, hot off the number one song in the world in I Get Around and charting high with Help Me Rhonda, mulls in the background in crowd scenes. The non-casted girl extras were, in fact, the real surfer girls who roamed the SoCal beach scene at the time- including the original and real Gidget- and were featured more prominently in the shots than the male extras because- they looked great in bikinis. Mike Nader- primal surfer and buddy of Dora's- incredibly wound up co-starring with Linda Evans, 20 years later, in Dynasty.

The scenes with Buster Keaton were really stupendous and it was great to see him in several scenes and not just a one-shot cameo. The Don Rickles insult bit in his club was priceless, the singing wasn't outstanding but wasn't bad either, and the slapstick was a nice throwback to the old Mack Sennett comedies that you scarcely see today. Frankie and Annette made seven beach party flicks together not counting an NBC pilot which aired in 1978. Their last teaming in 1987 was more of a nostalgia trip than a real story and they played different characters than they had in the American International studio's series they made in the 1960's. They appeared in six films in the 60's, with just one (1964's PAJAMA PARTY) wherein they played characters different from their better known five-film series with the Von Zipper gang,Deadhead, etc., for AIP. As such, this series continued a great tradition of movies with continuing settings and stock characters, that hearken back to the good old days of Andy Hardy, Dr. Kildare, the Thin Man and Tarzan. Even more recent times has seen the trend of continuing characters in familiar settings going forward in the James Bond, Rocky, and Batman stories, just to name a few, besides lesser vehicles like the National Lampoon and Police Academy series in the 80's and 90's. In Hollywood, nothing succeeds like success, so the sequel will always be with us and some will go on and on. It will be interesting to see if the new Nancy Drew film will spawn a series of sequels as it did two generations ago. If it's successful the first time around, don't bet against it.

After years of watching, I could never grow tired of Annette and Frankie doing their little girl-friend/boy-friend thing while frequently interrupted by infectious surf music.The actors deserve our respect for not only agreeing to work for peanuts, but also for filming during the chilly days of November so the film could be released the following spring, all so the American public could enjoy watching these kids' seemingly happy summer vacations. This was never meant to be a serious project to impress the Motion Picture Academy, just plain Summer fun with great 60s California Sound, just prior to the sudden impact of Flower Power, Mama's & Papas, etc.Beach Blanket Bingo also features the talented singer Donna Loren in a bit part as herself.

As you can tell, this movie is not dealing with reality...but it's fast, funny, very colorful (if you see a good print like I did), very campy, and also has Paul Lynde (hilarious) and Don Rickles (pretty bad...but the material just isn't there for him).  The songs are actually pretty good and the dialogue is (I assume) purposedly laughable.  Frankie and Annette and the other teens can't act (or sing, or dance) but they all look great in bathing suits and there's buff guys and gorgeous girls for everybody to enjoy.  The only low points  Lembeck is stupid and unfunny as von Zipper, the movie really falls apart at the end with a real speeded-up car chase and poor Buster Keaton is reduced to chasing girls around.  Still it was a lot of fun!  You have to see it on a wide screen and bright color to really enjoy it.  Otherwise, it isn't worth it.

The score is perfect early-60s pop (with everyone singing in full reverb), and the various comedians (Paul Lynde, Don Rickles and Buster Keaton) are allowed to play off their strengths.By this point, the series is beginning to look for new areas to explore (having already dealt with surfing, water skiing, body building, etc., in earlier entries), so that's why this beach film seems to be so focused on sky diving.  In fact, the shift away from the beach scene to the hippie scene in the late 60s would spell the end of the series only a year or so later.Beyond the sky diving, the film actually extends some of the supporting characters beyond the limited schtick they had been given previously.  Stock villain Eric von Zipper (Harvey Lembeck) is given tons more screen time--and even gets his own musical number for the first time! And Bonehead (Joel McCrea, Jr.) not only gets his own subplot, but his story veers the film into a sort of bittersweet romance--something most people would never expect to see attempted in the broad farce that structures these films...much less pulled off!Beach Blanket Bingo is no masterpiece--but, of its kind, its pretty great!

Plenty of it here as Von Zipper and his gang of fools kidnap a girl singer that Eric falls for. Meanwhile, Bonehead is falling for a mermaid, while Frankie and Annette are staying jealous of each other, as usual. Lots of singing and shaking out of the 30 year old teens keeps the action going, while Paul Lynde makes faces and gags it up. A dumber film would be hard to find, but I still found myself laughing at this really, really stupid picture. Eric Von Zipper made it well worth seeing, as did Lynde, one of my all time favorite comics.

However in the interest of maintaining a well rounded view of cinematic achievement, I caught this today on Turner Classic Movies. Boy, was it dumb.The host on TCM stated that each of the Frankie and Annette beach party movies were shot completely in a few hours, and then took about forty minutes to edit. It didn't sound like he was kidding about that, and judging by Beach Blanket Bingo, that formula is probably pretty close. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if the film makers were working without a script too, because the situations and dialog at times appear to be completely at random, with no help from editing. For example, there's a scene where Bonehead (Jody McCrae) begins to pine after Lorelei (Marta Kristen) as she swims away in the moonlight, but instead of allowing the situation to build with emotion, the scene abruptly cuts to one of the skydiving sequences in bright daylight.It also would have helped if Dee Dee (Annette Funicello) and Frankie (Frankie Avalon) managed to stay in character from scene to scene. With Frankie scanning every babe to pass into view throughout the film, one minute Dee Dee is jealous, and the next the pair are lovey dovey. It doesn't help that Frankie epitomizes male chauvinism with his 'boys are different' philosophy, as much as stating that Dee Dee should concentrate on staying in the kitchen instead of learning to sky dive.It would be hard to come up with the movie's low point, but the leading contenders have to include Rickels' monologue when he tells Annette he never did like her anyway, and Zipper's (Harvey Lembeck) song lyric 'We'll give them the finger now. For me personally, it would be South Dakota Slim's (Timothy Carey) trip to the 'booby shack', by that time I felt like Jack Nicholson after the lobotomy in 'Cuckoo's Nest'. For my money, Slim is in the running for the most pathetic movie character ever.But hey, at least Linda Evans has that Lesley Gore thing going for her in a couple of singing numbers, which I would have bet were dubbed but weren't. And I did like the description of Von Zipper's 'Rats' as Carbon Monoxide Commandos; that was about the most thought put into this flick. But come on, you know you saw that 'fish out of water' line coming from a mile away.I know I'm in the minority here based on some of the other posters for this film, but nostalgia only goes so far. When the final scene came down blessed by that 'Fin-ee', I could only scratch my head and repeat one of Frankie Avalon's lines from the picture - You know, I just don't know.Oh yeah, Buster Keaton is in the movie too, but I just don't believe it.

This idiotic junk has the beach party gang involved in skydiving AND kidnapping with neither plot-thread even remotely bearable. The opening musical number features a typical non-song lip-synched by Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello, both of whom had to be sick to death of these movies by 1965. Avalon is particularly annoying bickering with Paul Lynde, who plays the proverbial adult square. The final chase scene, shot in fast motion as if the filmmakers wanted to stop this nonsense as quickly as possible, is moronic. With the usual assortment of Z-grade talent Harvey Lembeck, Deborah Walley, Jody McCrae and, in one of his last and most thankless appearances, Buster Keaton.

As I get older, I see crap that appeared in the 60s and 70s gain classic status. Now, people talk about the wonderful shows and movies of this bygone era (such as I dream of Jeanie, Gilligan's Island, Bewitched, etc.) and I think I must have lost my mind! I mean, even in the time they were being produced, these TV shows were seen as, at best, meaningless fluff. Movies, it seems, have also undergone this revisionism. Rotten old duds are now seen as great fun or classics. I HATE the word classic--it no longer has any meaning as it seems to apply to ANYTHING as long as it is old--by that standard, Plan 9 From Outer Space is a classic!.So why did I pick this particular movie to review? There surely are MANY grossly overrated pictures but this one gets the nod because I just opened by Leonard Maltin guide and found he gave this movie 3 stars. That's like hanging a velvet Elvis painting in the Louvre!! Come on folks--don't be fooled. This is American-International Pictures AND Annette Funicello AND Frankie Avalon! There can't be a greater recipe for dreck than this!

Beach Blanket Bingo is an eye roll-inducing piece of swill about a gaggle of sexually inactive teenagers trying to protect a mermaid from a biker gang. How tragic that they wasted a potentially hilarious plot on something so stupid. If nothing else, couldn't they have waited a few years so that they could have thrown in some sex?! I mean, THEY HAD A MERMAID AND THEY COULDN'T DO IT WITH HER?!!!!!!!!! WHY?!!!!!!!!!! And isn't it more chic to portray biker gangs as cool? Anyway, the fact that Buster Keaton appears in this just goes to show how far he had gotten reduced. I don't doubt that the two people from Bewitched (director William Asher and co-star Paul Lynde) probably prefer to be associated with that show and not with this. It's no accident that Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello never became A-list stars (unless you count his appearance in Grease). Nowadays, I think that we only know her because she has multiple sclerosis, the same thing that afflicted Richard Pryor. MST3K really should have shown this flick; Mike, Servo and Crow could have made some great comments. "}]
