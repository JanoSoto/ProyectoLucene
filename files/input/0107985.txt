[{"Title":"Very funny baseball comedy","Date":"4 December 2000","Score":"10 out of 14 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Fantasy","Review":"  Rookie of the Year is one of my favorite baseball movies. One of the things I liked the most about this movie is that it's set in Chicago, my hometown. Most of the action in the film takes place at Wrigley Field, home of the long suffering Chicago Cubs. It's about a clumsy 12-year-old boy named Henry Rowengartner, who loves to play baseball. However, the kid can't do anything right on the field. One day, trying to impress a girl, he tries to catch a fly ball. But ends up slipping on a baseball lying on the ground and in the process breaks his right arm. After four months of recouperation, the cast comes off. Afterwards Henry's mother gives him and his two best friends tickets to the latest Cubs game. The three boys are sitting in the bleachers when a home run is hit. The ball lands close to where they're sitting and one of Henry's friends recovers the ball. The fans sitting nearby yell at the kid to throw it back on to the field. The kid doesn't want to do it and gives the ball to Henry's other friend who ends up giving the ball to Henry. He agrees to do it. Then an amazing thing happens. Henry not only throws the ball back on to the field, he throws the ball all the way to home plate! The crowd is in stunned silence after seeing this. Who threw that ball? is the question on everyone's mind. When the owners find out it's Henry, they ask him if he would like to pitch for the Cubs. Henry goes bonkers and agrees to pitch. After throwing some practice pitches, the owners and managers discover that he has a 100 m.p.h. fastball. They think this could be the perscription the Cubs need since they're already going through another disasterous season (which is all too familiar in real life). Henry becomes the star rookie of the team as the closer. And the Cubs start winning and begin to turn their season around. Rookie of the Year has alot of big laughs and a terrific cast. There are four memorable performances in this film. Thomas Ian Nicholas is wonderful as Henry. This actor has grown up since this film (he was most recently seen in the hit film American Pie), but he's in a role to remember; Gary Busey is also very good as the aging star pitcher known as 'The Rocket' who helps out Henry in certain spots; Albert Hall as the Cubs manager who repeatedly keeps mispronouncing Henry's last name in different formats; and Amy Morton, a Chicago stage actress, as Henry's mother Mary. Some of the most effective moments in the film are with the boy and his mom. Also there are hilarious smaller performances by Eddie Bracken as the Cubs owner; John Candy as the Cubs broadcast announcer; and Daniel Stern (who also directed) in the film's goofiest role as the dim-witted pitching coach. Rookie of the Year has the usual predictable sports ending, but since this film is so much fun, who cares. There is one obvious continuity error in the film. When they fly to L.A. to play the Los Angeles Dodgers at Dodger Stadium, you can tell they're really playing at Comiskey Park, home of Chicago's other baseball team, the White Sox. You can tell just by that, that this film was shot entirely in Chicago. Rookie of the Year is a baseball winner in my book.***1/2 (out of four)  "},{"Title":"A fun, warm film for the whole family.","Date":"17 March 1999","Score":"6 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Fantasy","Review":"  I really enjoy the film Rookie of the Year. I even bought the tape, and I pop it in once a month or so when I need a pick-me-up. It's funny and warm and rewarding as well. I really like the character of Mary, the mother of the boy with the 'rocket fire' arm. A single mother, she worries that her son has no one to look up to, but we learn things about her that gives the finale an extra shot of warmth. Daniel Stern did a very nice job of directing, and he got good performances all around. Gary Busey is great, and the way he and the other ball players come around to liking the kid is fun. I also like the pacing of the movie, there's always a 'moment' just around the corner. The film is full of fun moments, and when I start the tape I have to watch through to the end. Have kids? Have they seen this film? Give it a try, good clean fun family entertainment.

I guess the fact that so many young boys, myself included, fantasize about playing professional sports contributes to the popularity of this genre. I think Daniel Stern did a good job directing this movie because he doesn't ever let it become too kiddy and childish. Sure there are a lot of funny moments, but they can be funny to adults as well as children. The setting of this movie cannot be beat Wrigley Field. It doesn't get any better than that. Rookie of the Year is a fun movie to watch with the family. "},{"Title":"Bringing the fun back to baseball","Date":"20 November 2004","Score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Fantasy","Review":" This movie asks the question What if pro baseball was fun again, like in little league, and not so taken so seriously? The device of Henry's miraculous arm allows the story to inject a kid's eye view into a somewhat cynical world. Juxtaposing the sleazy Dan Hedaya's attempted $25 million trade of Henry to the Yankees with the Henry and his buddies taking a day trip on a boat, as well as Henry's adolescent antics on the field, director Daniel Stern is trying to get us to look at baseball, and maybe sports, maybe life, like we did when we were ten. I think Roger Ebert, although I agree with his review, took pretty poor notes while reviewing this film. From his article When the cast comes off, his dad takes him to Wrigley Field, and he catches a home run ball while he's out in the bleachers, and then he throws it back - all the way to the catcher behind the plate. Actually, he went with his friends, he doesn't even know his dad. And he didn't catch it, his friends pick it up from nearby, and hand it to him because they're scared to throw it on TV and embarrass themselves. Doesn't he have a fact-checker to proof his reviews?Second, he writes Henry becomes an overnight celebrity, and is signed to the Cubs by the team's genial owner. This ignores the desperation of Dan Hedaya, the would-be owner of the team, who sees the publicity and marketing windfall in having a kid on the team. The sell-out crowd is an important story element, as it reinforces the idea that we are all hungry for baseball to be fun again. There's are lots of laughs to be had in this film, although Stern seems to want to indulge in over-the-top hysterics from time to time, such as with the character he was playing. Also, the bilious Jack who gets Henry's mom to sign a contract without telling her it's a trade to NY, is downright spastic in his final scene. Stern shows a lot of promise as a comedy director if he could tone it down just a touch with the tangential characters. Understatement can be funny, as Busey shows with a few choice glares at the right moments. I loved Stern's allusion to the Wizard of Oz, likening the Emerald City gates to the Wrigley stadium gates, when Henry first arrives to play. The Cubs haven't won a Series since 1909. And a little child shall lead them... Every kid should see this movie.

I thought that Daniel Stern as the pitching coach was hilarious but in reality a guy like him would have been fired before the first pitch of the season-at least the late, great Steinbrenner would. It was also nice to see how a young teenager would adapt to the adult world of baseball.This is about a 12-year-old who can suddenly throw a hundred miles an hour after he recovered from a broken arm. Once again, that's impossible in real life. Anyway, he is a midseason addition to the Cubs and he makes them more than the mediocre team that they were.Overall, this is a pretty solid sports movie. There was great acting by the kids. But the ending is all to predictable. I rate this film 7/10. "},{"Title":"A Truly Awful Remake","Date":"12 June 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Fantasy","Review":" Daniel Stern should stick to comic roles, since this film makes clear that he has no talent for directing. It's hard to tell whether the acting is as bad as it seems here, or whether it was Stern's amateurish oversight that made every line go clunk. To make matters worse, there is not a single frame in which the action, such as it is, feels emotionally authentic. This problem is exacerbated by a camera that lingers for too long on each and every shot, especially the numerous and increasingly tiresome slow-motion scenes.Stern appears in the film himself, hamming it up so badly that he actually makes co-actor Gary Busey look pretty good. With respect to the way balls are hit, caught and pitched, and base paths are run, the game played in this film evokes real baseball about as well as William Bendix did on the mound in The Babe Ruth Story.I was eager to see this movie because the 1954 original, Roogie's Bump, was one of my favorites as a kid. Too bad the effort fell so flat. Along with the Danny Glover version of Angels in the Outfield, Rookie of the Year stands as one of the least accomplished remakes of a baseball classic. "},{"Title":"A mostly-vanilla film existing in an already overblown genre","Date":"26 September 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Fantasy","Review":" Rookie of the Year is just about as genial as a baseball movie of the nineties can be before it becomes a tad too grating for my personal tastes. The film dances on a line between being too concerned with ridiculous humor and too fixated on creating a sentimental environment that, between those two things, has difficultly really making one enjoy the fun of the baseball game at hand.The film stars Thomas Ian Nicholas as the ambitious youngster Henry Rowengartner, a twelve-year-old Little League player with dreams of playing in the major leagues for his favorite team, the Chicago Cubs. His dream is often mocked by his friends and classmates, as Henry isn't a very good player and has quite a clumsy aura about him. In an attempt to catch a ball thrown by one of the school's bullies, Henry slips on another ball lying on the ground and breaks his arm, having to wrap it in a thick and relatively debilitating cast. When the arm finally heals, the doctor removes the cast to reveal that Henry's tendons have healed very tightly, with Henry able to cock his arm back and fire a ball with incomparable force.His talents are shown throwing a foul ball back to home plate from the stands at a Chicago Cubs game, prompting the Cubs to contract the youngest player in MLB history as the team's starting pitcher. Henry couldn't be happier, but earns some justified opposition and hesitance from the team's aging pitcher Chet Rocket Steadman (Busey), one of Henry's idols. Despite his good-nature and kind spirits, Henry's presence has the ability to ruffle feathers and occasionally upset his teammates, and also makes him the target for his mother's greedy boyfriend Jack (Bruce Altman), who looks to take advantage of him and his abilities.Rookie of the Year inevitably suffers comparison to Little Big League, another nineties baseball film that was more-or-less eclipsed by the success and familiarity of this film just a year later. While Little Big League did a fine job at illustrating what could potentially happen if an eleven-year-old was left to his own wits to manage a Major League Baseball team he inherited, Rookie of the Year deals with an equally unlikely story in a less interesting manner. Despite all efforts by director Daniel Stern (famous for his role as one of the burglars in both Home Alone films among many other comedies) and writer Sam Harper, Rookie of the Year only manages to be a fair and humbly likable picture, light on its humor elements with more emphasis placed on redundant, and occasionally crude, gags.The nineties was already a time where baseball films were a dime a dozen, with films being made for children and adults alike. I'm holding Rookie of the Year to the works of the era, like A League of Their Own, Little Big League, and, everybody's favorite, The Sandlot. The film's funniest scenes come from the uncredited John Candy, who plays the Cubs announcer always eager to bet against them. With all of this in mind, Rookie of the Year is harmless and cheery, like its protagonist, always bearing a good heart and a clear mind, but admittedly, pretty forgettable.Starring Thomas Ian Nicholas, Gary Busey, Dan Hedaya, Bruce Altman, Daniel Stern, and John Candy. Directed by Daniel Stern.

Certainly not the sort I liked 50 years ago when I was 12. Maybe this sort of movie would appeal to them. I can't say.It didn't do anything for me, but then, as I say, I'm not 12 years old.Instead, it struck me as a boy's version of The Natural, which I didn't get a lot out of either. A guy - or, in this case, a boy - has a stroke of good luck and acquires a magic power that makes him a great baseball player. It's luck, and not the result of hard work. (For that, see The Stratton Story, which is one of my favorite baseball movies.) He has a glorious career until the magic wears out. That didn't do much for me in The Natural, and it doesn't do much for me here. Played as comedy it can work - see It Happens Every Spring - but not, for me, as drama, because there's no drama involved.I don't know if boys still dream about baseball anymore. Maybe those who do, if they still exist, might enjoy this movie. If so, let them so do.But I won't be watching it again myself, at 62.

The desperate Cubs immediately tracks him down and signs him as a pitcher.This is Daniel Stern's only directorial full length movie. He's done some Wonder Years episodes before this. There isn't any glaring directing problems. It's a relatively good effort. Stern must be a long suffering Cubs fan. Only a Cubs fan could come up a 12 year old savior for the long suffering club.Thomas Ian Nicholas is a charming little boy. He encompasses the innocence and the wonder that this movie absolutely requires. The final 3 outs are the stuff of teen boys' fantasy. That's the kind of wholesome entertainment this is all about.

The rest of the cast gave good performances such as Gary Busey playing the player Rockie and Eddie Bracken did a good job playing the Cubs owner. I also liked John Candy's hilarious performance as the announcer for the games. And Daniel Stern also gave a good performance as the goofy player Phil Berquist.

Still, it's worth a few bucks, and may transport adults back to their memories and make them fantasize more than children.  I don't like this film a whole lot, but it's just one of those films that when you see it on TV, you just...watch it! Hard to explain. It's like some cosmic force draws you to it.

(Personally, I'm a Cleveland Indians fan, so I think you get my point.) Yes, Daniel Stern puts in an embarrassing role as a clumsy pitching coach (now, fantasies aside, this clown wouldn't last 10 seconds as a major league coach!), and Thomas Ian Nicholas is OK in the title role but comes off as pretty annoying most of the time.

This one is about a kid who is not the best player in the world and he has an accident. This accident causes his arm to mess up and the tendons to tighten and now he can throw a 100 mph fastball. Well he displays this super ability at a Cubs game where he proceeds to throw a home run ball back into the field of play and before long he is signed with the Cubs giving inspirational speeches, striking out great players and guiding the Cubs to the post season. The Cubs were absolutely not a playoff team when this film was made and to make it out like one kid could turn around the team is completely insane even for movie standards. For one thing he is just a reliever, and a reliever has to have the lead going into the 8th or 9th inning to have any impact on the game and quite frankly I think the Cubs actually had a decent reliever back then. The comedy does not work for me neither did Daniel Stern (who actually directed this movie) as a pitching coach. John Candy is in the film as a play by play guy, but he is not even credited in the cast. Granted I guess if your him you do not need your name to be recognized. On an interesting note you get to see Barry Bonds as a Pirate and before he gained one of those white orbs from Altered Beast and became super big. In fact I think he had actually gotten two of those orbs by the end of his playing days, one more and he would have actually become a wolf man hybrid. Sorry, went off track there, and I am doubting there are a lot of people that will get the reference. In the end, this film might be okay for children. To me though it was just idiotic and just about a complete waste of time.

Therefore it hovers down at a kid's level. Good family movies go above a kid's level so that the younger viewer may actually learn something, and the older viewer might possibly say Hmmm, this is an intelligent kid's movie. Watching this kids learn how to cheat, show off, scream like an escaped retard, and be poor sports. Yeah it's a comedy, so the rules may be broken, but that doesn't account for the terrible acting and asinine writing. I have enjoyed several kid's movies, so the excuse that you didn't like it because you're an adult and this movie is made for kids doesn't hold any water and therefore is eliminated as a legitimate reason. This movie is insulting to viewers with a functioning brain and an IQ over 50.There are a lot of cameo appearances by some good actors in this in a failed attempt to legitimize the film. Even John Candy can't save it, and he hams it up as the home announcer with incredible mediocrity.The worst performance in this mess is Daniel Stern's character, who overacts with such a vengeance (even worse than in Home Alone) that he makes Will Ferrell seem like a shy introvert. Screaming out some of the most unfunny lines in cinematic history, Stern brings the film down several notches. For those of you who actually liked Stern's character in this - you are a supreme bunch of ignorant idiots. Small wonder that he hasn't been called on to direct anything else after this garbage.If you want to see a good baseball movie then try Major League, Bad News Bears (the original - NOT the stupid remake), Field of Dreams, A League of Their Own, or Bull Durham if you haven't already seen them.

Then the day the cast comes off he discovers that his arm healed in a interesting way, during that same day, he and his friends are at a baseball game but when the ball comes near him in the stands he picks it up and he displays an amazing throwing ability. The Cubs owner then ask him to join the team, where he gets to play with his favorite player named Rocket. I liked this movie because it shows that any tries dreams come true.

He loved it, and I thought it was good, too. It was amusing, and sweet, and had good messages (don't abandon your friends, somethings are more important than money, your mom is the coolest).A totally good family film for old and young. (as long as you like baseball). No Academy Award, nothing to write home about, but good with popcorn, and a kid leaning on your shoulder.

Although the director (Daniel Stern) is the stupid type of guy he somehow manages to pull out a funny, comedic movie that is great for the whole family.The acting is pretty dull like Henry, (Thomas Ian Nicholas) the boy who breaks his arm and due to his broken arm it allows him to throw 98 MPH and after this he join the MLB.This is the likable kind of movie for the whole family but if your looking for a movie with good acting I wouldn't recommend this movie.

But I guess you never thought of a child playing baseball with the pros. As, the movie opens, the future owner of the Chicago Cubs Larry Fish Fisher (Dan Hedaya), is told that if the Chicago Cubs, doesn't sell out games for the rest of the season, the Cubs will have to leave baseball. And they get answer when a child named Harry Rowengartner (Thomas Ian Nicholas), who recently had suffered a broken arm, and spent the summer in a cast, gets, out of the cast, finds his arm has become a 100 mph arm. When he throws a baseball to the catcher behind home plate all the way from the bleachers. Which catchs the attention of Larry, the team's existing owner Bob Carson (Eddie Bracken), the team's manger (Albert Hall) and the Cubs play-by play boardcaster (John Candy in an uncrdited role). The Buddy Holly story's Gary Busey plays the team's aging pitcher, Amy Morton plays Henry's mom, and Bruce Altmn plays Henry's mom's boyfriend.10/10                   "}{"Title":"funny","Date":"10 August 2001","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Fantasy","Review":"  Oh dear...It was funny. Yep. I bet since I'm a big Cubs fan and am a softball player, it's funnier to me than some people. I know that other teams suck (but not as bad as the cubs did...before this season...I still can't believe they are in first. For the first month, I kept telling my dad it was a big practical joke. lol), but it wouldn't be the same to me if it was a different team. I'd probably see it as dumb and boring. But since I can go I've been there! and stuff, it's much more fun. I just pass out laughing (almost) when ever they make a lame comment about how bad the Cubs are doing. (You know, like 'The Cubs have their longest winning streak of the season 2 or the credit at the end 'The people of Chicago who never gave up.) It's too bad the couldn't have had a real Cubs announcer do the commentary (Steve Stone or the late Harry Carey). Or have some of the real Cubs in the movie....*smiles* That woulda been awesome! o)If anyone reads this, and you know why Robert Picardo is thanked in the credits, please email me at sarah02134@hotmail.com to tell me. It's driving me nuts!I would give it stars, but see, I have a very weird opinion on movies compared to the rest of the population, so I won't.

It is quite easy to see that the film has been filmed in a very short time, cause the directing of the cast is terrible. A little more time to direct the cast would have been nice, because the cast has a lot more to offer than they show in this movie.

If I want a good baseball movie, I'll flip on Bull Durham, which has more laugh out loud funny lines than this piece of junk. Daniel Stern is out of his league with this film, which shows why he hasn't directed a film since this one.I'm sure kids will enjoy it. It's inoffensive, it's cute and it's easy to get.I can say that you should probably avoid this film, if possible. Daniel Stern shows that films should be made by filmmakers, not him.

So, call me old-fashioned or whatever else you want, but this film was stupid. Maybe if you're kid, you wouldn't think so, but adults - stay away.As for kids, I found way too many OMGs in this film, both by the mother and the 12-year- old kid (played by Thomas Ian Nicholas). This was actor Daniel Stern's directorial debut and he promised publicly to make safe family films. That's great, but this isn't a great start. Oh my gosh, said by the kid would have but a better and smarter example to set to other kids than the other blasphemes. We also see early '90s Hollywood fad of having a mother literally punch out her boyfriend. That's safe family fare? I am tired of Hollywood's PC-feminist baloney of showing women acting tough like Mike Tyson. It just ain't so.The one good part in this film was the role played by Gary Busey. At least he played someone who was a good role model.

There are some real laughs, not just chuckles. Hey, it's much better than some other baseball comedies that have been released. It's good for the family, too. Oh sure, there are some mistakes here and there, but the film makes up for them by being completely entertaining. "}]
