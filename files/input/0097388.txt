It lacks horror, story and qualities of any kind. The fact that the film was released makes me sick. The film drags on a ferry with a bundle of bad acting characters which are all slaughtered off in terrible ways. Then when they finally reach Manhattan which is towards the end may I add, the plot barley even involves Jason and is another half an hour dragging on to complete the film. The film becomes even more cheesy and is not scary what so ever and completely ruins the film when Jason is seen by half of Manhattan chasing the two helpless victims because nobody seems to be doing anything to help them. If you think it could only get better, well you're wrong, as Jason goes to Hell is just as bad!

The change of scenery from the dark, foreboding woods of Camp Crystal Lake to a luxury cruise liner completely ruins Jason's mystique. Jason is a killer made for stalking around the ominous woods, not sauntering through hallways and crosswalks. The kills are numerous and bloody... but don't compare to some of the other installments. Overall, this movie is simply not very scary.For the latter group however, this movie is a gem. Packed full of stereotypes and inexplicably idiotic characters, you can't help but laugh as each one is picked off, Jason-style. With Asian valedictorians, black athletes, and white party girls, the lack of effort that the writers put into the film is clearly evident. It's almost as if the writers got together and tried to figure out how to fit the maximum amount of gratuitous violence and nudity into an hour and a half movie... sheer brilliance.For me? 8/10, one of the best comedies I've seen in a while.

We watched Jason X first, and both agreed that it was pretty bad. And then we watched this..... Oh god this was horrible. To start, the concept is stupid, Jason going to Manhattan. Cities in New York are really over used in movies, no matter how good the movie may be. In the flashback at the beginning, of young Jason drowning, they COMPLETELY screwed up what his appearance is supposed to be. Jason was supposed to look like a bald, deformed child. In this, he has plenty of hair, and he looks like a normal little boy. Another thing, I do believe Jason SWIMS to that cruise thats headed towards Manhattan (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong). Everyone who knows enough about Jason Voorhees and the Friday series should know that he can't swim, and that he's afraid of water. And even if I am wrong about that, why would they make him be on a boat, surrounded by water? And one incredibly stupid is when Jason is chasing those two people IN FRONT OF HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE, Jason scares those kids by lifting up his mask. And finally, the final scene in the sewer, Jason's hockey mask comes off, and you get to see his face. AND THEY SCREW THAT UP TOO. Again, Jason is supposed to look deformed. In this, they make him look like a zombie in those clich√©' zombie movies. I could go on all day about how bad this movie is. Don't rent it. I seriously regret renting it, even if you want to rent a bad movie to get a laugh about it. This is a horrible movie, and I'm never watching it again. The end.

But this movie really takes the cake. It is without a doubt the worst Friday the 13th, second only to Part V A New Beginning. Not even the presence of the (somewhat) well-known Peter Mark Richman and the now-famous Jason himself, Kane Hodder, could make this film make any sense.The movie is flawed in many ways, one of the biggest of which involves Rennie Wickham's constant visions of Jason Voorhees as a young child. Often times she is touched by these visions and yet Jason is either with her at the time or is near her, which makes someone want to ask What is going on in this girl's head?. The visions may have been caused by deep psychological trauma suffered from the events of the flashback seen towards the end where she almost drowns and encounters Jason as a young child. But that flashback is a primary example of how flawed this movie is in terms of the continuity of the series. It is determined in Part 2 that Jason did, in fact, not drown as a child but survived and spent the rest of his childhood in the woods, which eventually leads to him being the fully grown undead serial killer the fans have grown to love.Another major flaw is the ending, in which Jason is drowned in toxic waste. However, seconds before being doused with said chemicals, water shoots out of his mouth almost for no apparent reason. It may have been the intention of the writers to do this to remind the viewers that it would be the second time Jason has drowned in his life, but I highly doubt it. And then the end after Jason is killed, the audience is shown the body of a young boy, which is no doubt Jason Voorhees. This ending would indicate that Jason was always a boy but . . . something, maybe being reborn with a body of swamp algae and barnacles that the toxic waste disintegrated? Highly unlikely once again.And of course, there is the flaw of Jason's apparent ability to change places at the blink of an eye, in which he is seen in one place for one moment and then seems to move with lightning fast stealth in front of the characters almost like Freddy Krueger. How is it that someone in reality who walks slower than Michael Myers can move so quickly off camera, especially if he never seemed to be this quick in the previous movies? The only time we see Jason take a shortcut to get to his destination faster is towards the end when he's chasing Sean Robertson and Rennie Wickham through the tunnels.All of these flaws are the faults of the writers, all of whom may need to reconsider their paths and/or hire their own editors.

Of course Maltin rated virtually every other Friday film a dud, so that's not saying much. In any event, he's wrong. But while this eighth installment is comparatively inferior to most that preceded it, it's not as bad as reputed outside Maltin circles.Jason Takes Manhattan is one of those movies that's impossible to love unconditionally. There are simply too many flaws, from ridiculous plot elements (Jason can teleport???) and an uneven pace to a lack of chills and incompatible attempts at humor. Indeed this entry represents a bitter come-down after the absolutely stellar parts VI and VII.In many ways, Jason Takes Manhattan doesn't feel like part of the franchise. The Jason here isn't scary like we know he can be. His deadly moves, be it the electric guitar impaler or decapitatingly powerful right hook, seem contrived. Kane Hodder looks like a guy in a Jason suit rather than the real deal. Director Rob Hedden fell into the trap of gore for the sake of gore, but that's never been what Friday the 13th is all about. It's all in the build-up, and sometimes, even in low-budget '80s horror, less is more.With all of that said, Jason Takes Manhattan isn't a total loss. The mere sight of the rapidly decaying villain storming through the mean streets of the Big Apple is worth at least four stars. Aside from the change of scenery, the film offers a semi-compelling storyline or two. And the masked one does have his frightening moments, smashing through portholes and firing harpoons at horny teens. As usual, the climax -- this time a chase through the city and sewer -- is the highlight.For better or for worse, Jason Takes Manhattan marks the last true Friday the 13th. This was Paramount's last stab (pun intended) at things before selling the rights to New Line Cinema, which basically destroyed the series with absurd ideas like Jason switching bodies and rampaging through spaceships. Not great, but not godawful, this film carries limited appeal outside of fanboy circles.

The MPAA has done alot to these movies, but they're still grand entertainment at the very least. Jason is taken down several times in the big apple, by Sean and Renny, but he keeps on tickin'. Near the film's finale we see Jason's face, once again and then he is splashed with toxic waste and turns into a little boy again. There has been so much talk about what happens between Part 8 and 9.

The kids in Final Destination flew to Europe, and these kids go on a freaking cruise? I went to Magic Mountain for my senior trip! Oh, well, I guess the payback is that in the movies they all get killed. Magic Mountain sounds a lot better in that sense. By this point in the lengthy Friday the 13th saga, it's clear that even the writers of these movies (generally the last people to catch on when they come up with idiotic ideas) have noticed that a lot of teenagers going up to Camp Crystal Lake to be rebellious and get slashed all up is getting a little bit old, so in this installment they decided it would be a good idea to have the movie take place on a whole ship full of high school students. Moving someone like Jason Voorhees from his home on Camp Crystal Lake to an unfamiliar setting is actually a really good idea for generating more interest in the series, because although it's a given in a series like this, I think audiences always like to see familiar characters come back from other stories. So while you already know Jason is going to be in the movie because it's a Friday the 13th, you at least see him in an unfamiliar atmosphere, which removes a lot of the automatic cynicism that is now being generated toward the teenagers who are still stupid enough to go out to the lake. Now we see Jason killing all kinds of kids unsuspectingly on their school trip and then more people on the streets of New York. Amazing the things we find entertaining these days, isn't it?There are a lot of fairly innovative deaths aboard the ship in the first half of the film, such as a guy relaxing in the sauna getting one of the hot rocks shoved through his stomach, a guy getting impaled on the communication antenna on the boat, and throat slit by a machete, an amazingly botched scene. You would think that since it was so obvious the knife didn't even touch that poor guy, they would at least not have done it in such a close-up.Ironically enough, the part that I was anticipating to be the most interesting was the least creatively done. After realizing what is going on on the boat (meaning, after just about all of them had been killed), the surviving students on board get the life raft and escape, rowing out into the dark ocean in hopes of hitting land. Eventually, they see the New York City skyline and jump for joy. I was anticipating a creative and fun romp through the streets of New York, maybe with Jason confused at his surroundings and therefore going even more nuts, which would create havoc among the population. I mean, LOOK at the guy. He spent the time between the last movie and this one rotting on the bottom of the lake, and he certainly looks like it through this entire movie.Unfortunately, the filmmakers not only revealed the modesty of their budget through the lack of anything really interesting happening, they also displayed a massive lack of understanding of the geography of the city of New York. I've never even been there myself, but it seems like pretty much basic logic that they would not design the city so that the dirtiest slums had the finest waterfront property. Meaning, I doubt you could row up to New York from the ocean, right alongside the Statue of Liberty, and climb up onto land, finding yourself surrounded by endless alleyways full of things like gun-toting rapists and standing barrels of toxic waste. New York is a big city, and all cities throughout the world pretty much have to have things like this somewhere, but generally not right on the water and right next to major monuments. I happen to know, for example, that if you go to San Francisco, you won't find the crime-ridden slums right under the Golden Gate Bridge, and I doubt that you would find open barrels of toxic waste ANYWHERE.But anyway, they certainly find some room for effective comic relief (although notably less than other films in the series), my favorite example of which is the scene where Jason looks curiously at a picture of a hockey player on a billboard wearing exactly the same mask that he has on, a sort of self-realization that has since been overshadowed by the T-1000 pausing to look at a metallic mannequin in Terminator 2. I love that stuff, it gives even the most two-dimensional bad guys a sort of self-consciousness, so that they're not just mindless killing machines but have some semblance of actual thought in their heads, seeing and analyzing their surroundings and pausing when they see something that they don't understand. Makes the inhuman killers more human, you know?Speaking of which, there was also a scene that was really funny for much the same reason, and feel free to make fun of me for seeing it this way. There's a scene pretty near the end of the film where Jason is pursuing the few remaining kids through the streets of Manhattan, and he passes by some street punks hanging out and smoking on the sidewalk and listening to some ridiculous 80s music ('Livin' inna city ain't no big deal, livin' inna city ain't no big deal. If the drugs don't getcha then the hooka's will&#133;.' And so forth&#133;), and as Jason walks by, he kicks their boom-box across the sidewalk. Being tough gutterpunks, of course, they stand up and pull out their switchblades, informing Jason that he just dug his own grave. Jason's response is to turn and face them and lift up his mask so they can see his face. I liked that scene, because like the one above, it shows a self-consciousness. Jason KNOWS that he looks terrifying. He always has, and rotting on the bottom of the lake made it even worse. It also shows that he can deal with people in a way other than cutting them all up and still have it be pretty satisfying to the audience. The climax of the film is bogged down pretty badly by some heavily botched logic and another massive lack of understanding of the underbelly operations of a major city. First of all, none of the passersby up on the streets take a second look at this gigantic, wet, rotting man walking down the street with a hockey mask. I know New Yorkers can be cold and indifferent, but even THEY would not take something like THAT as normal. But even worse, as the kids escape into the underground sewage system (which does not run through wide walkways beneath the sidewalks in ANY city that doesn't want to smell like it's own waste), they run into a sewage worker who informs them that the sewers (in which they are currently standing) fill with toxic waste every night at midnight ('Exactly ten minutes from now!'), and is then killed by Jason before being able to show them how to get out.I won't get into the fact that there is no imaginable reason for any underground pipe system to fill with toxic waste every night at a certain time other than to create false suspense for a movie like this, although that is most of the reason that this climax falls so completely flat. We do get something for the kids to run away from and a time-limit for them to get out of the sewer, and we do get a glimpse of Jason's hideous face as he melts into the waste, but it is a completely contrived setting that has no basis in reality, which is the one thing that always makes horror films (or films of almost any genre, for that matter) more effective. Friday the 13th VIII, obviously, is not very concerned with that, which makes it one of the less interesting installments in the saga, although at least it takes place in a different setting so we have a reason to slap our foreheads other than because there is yet ANOTHER group of morons going up to Camp Crystal Lake to taunt the legend of Jason Voorhees.

The plot and dialogue are also alright for this kind of movie. Like I say, this isn't the best movie in the series, but it's the only later one that I can say I was entertained by. Jason enters the realm of comic relief in this entry in two very funny scenes. One where he smashes through a box holding up some thug's boom box. The thug stands up to fight, and Jason turns and lifts his mask, scaring the thug off. The second where a guy is punching Jason in the face to no avail, and then Jason punches his head clear off his shoulders.The one thing that bothered me about this entry is that the title is the most misleading title you'll ever see.

No success in that, but lets look at this peace of art as a standard slasher entertainment The story is quite pathetic but thats no problem, it always is.

For example a decapitation with a punch of a fist! The movie should be titled instead Jason Goes Sailing as most of it happens on a ship on it's way to New York.

One of the biggest pluses here is that there's plenty of fun slasher moments throughout here which gives this one some absolutely fun scenes here. The repeated nature of the kills here gives this one an incredibly frantic pace here that this one basically runs so constantly that there's plenty of action here, from the opening assault on the couples' boat and the stalking through the ship here that piles up a lot of great kills here spread all throughout the ship in getting in plenty of fun here in the finale where there's the rather fun encounters within the city here which gives this some really fun moments here where this one fully delivers as a slasher film. The chases in the ship here are truly a lot of fun as the frequent confrontations along the way provide the kind of enjoyable kills here in requiring this one with plenty of exciting action down in the boiler room, throughout the cabins and different start rooms and then finally out on to the deck of the ship here as the survivors attempt to flee the damaged, sinking ship with plenty of fun deaths in these confrontations. Even more impressive here is the scenes of them being chased through the city which are incredibly fun as well as the early chases through the dockyard with the junkies, into a crowded diner and through the subway are just some of the fun here that takes place within here, as there's even more fun with the chases through the streets in the police car, the absolutely brilliant boxing match taking place on-top of the building where it ends on one of the series' best kills and finishes up down in the sewers for some tense stalking in this section which makes for an overall fun time. Along with the great Jason look here, these make this quite enjoyable to hold off the few flaws here. The biggest issue here is the film's really tame and near-bloodless kills here that are about as far removed from what should've been seen here as this one cuts out nearly everything to the point of barely containing anything. There really should've been some more to this one's kills where they've really become edited-down badly. Another minor issue is the rather weird inclusion here of the mini-Jason tormenting her whenever she's near water which isn't really that integral to the story since it doesn't give her anything to use against Jason or give him motivation to track her down, as instead it's more of a plot-thread about her guardian so this makes no sense other than stretching out the running time. The only other problematic part here is the single lamest kill here in the whole series of a single strangulation where it could've gone through several other attempts instead of what actually happened. These here are the film's only real flaws.Rated R Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity, a mild sex scene, drug use, and Attempted Rape.

When Jason begins hacking up the repulsive cyphers on board, several believe it to be the deck hand, until he shows up with a butcher knife in his spine. A handful of these obnoxious nitwits are skewered, and a handful of less obnoxious characters survive and escape this now sinking ship on a small lifeboat and head for land, unknowingly followed by Jason. For someone who supposedly drown when he was a small boy, he now swims quite well.But wait, do they land in New York, or Vancouver? I see Times Square for only about ten minutes of the overlong run time.Decent writing, some of the camera-work is surprisingly inspired, and it's always a bit of fun to watch Jason go after annoying teenagers, but this film is really stretching it too thin. After the incredible makeup John Carl Buechler did in part VII, the biggest letdown for this installment is the gooey, slimy, subpar makeup effects. Jason looks like he's been slimed by that little green glob from Ghostbusters, or doused with a tub full of cottage cheese. Another major problem is that there are absolutely no shocks or scares at all. Unforgivable, considering this is a horror movie; those two offenses nearly sink this movie faster than the Lazarus sinks in it.The silly climax reveals that apparently all it takes to turn Jason into a small boy again is to drown him in toxic waste. (*shakes head in confusion*)I enjoyed this movie a bit more when I was younger, but it really hasn't aged well at all.

It gets the job done, and then some. The movie delivers everything we'd expect to see in a Jason movie; a gruesome body-count, cool and unusual ways of dying, and only having one or two survivors at the end of the ordeal. Plus, the movie has a cool and different setting that gives Jason some new tricks up his sleeves.Jason was thrown back into the lake and chained by the end of Part 7. However, his body has been disturbed once again and causes him to rise up from the lake and start his killing spree all over again. This time, things are a bit different as he sneaks onto a cruise boat full of students on their way to a field trip. Even though it is not his usual territory, Jason proves to be a unmerciful killer wherever he is. And the last 20 minutes or so Jason is in New York; a whole new playground for him to spread his terror and bloodshed.I thought this was a pretty neat movie. They went for something different and it worked (unlike Jason Goes to Hell). While it offers a different setting, it's still the good old Jason formula we've all come to love. I wished that Jason could've been in New York more, though. It would've been cool to see him get a chance to increase the body-count rather than just go after the ones who got off the boat (I know, he mainly only goes after those who return to Crystal Lake, but you have to admit it's a cool idea. I mean, he's there already. Why not give him a chance to take out more people?). Besides that little complaint, I thought it was a cool Jason flick.All in all, I found that Friday the 13th Part VIII Jason Takes Manhattan to be a successful addition to the Jason series. While it's not the best one in the series, it is still very entertaining and gets the job done. A very neat effort to make the Jason story a little more different and interesting.

There was camera guy, punk rock chick and hot naked girl with tattoos of body parts on her body - oh don't even try and have me remember any of their names.The deaths are all pretty bland although some stand out. The death in the hot girls bathroom was pretty nice, although I have to say I was rooting for Jason to just kill her anyway he wanted because she got annoying fast. The dance floor killing was pretty subdued but the use of the dance floor made it a little interesting. Oh and near the end where he drowns the teacher in a vat of waste, that was awesome.Jason looks pretty cool as well although I still think his look in Jason X was the best. I don't really know if I can recommend this installment, its pretty much worthless as nothing of interest is revealed about Jason himself and as a film itself its down right terrible.

The guy takes his top off but so what, after seeing that I thought I hope he dies and I got my wish a couple of minutes later.

Lastly he attacks them in Manhattan. There is a great scene where he breaks through this diner door, that was cool. Then he... well i DO not want to give away the whole thing. Good Points There is a brief bit of female nudity in it. Also the women are really cute. He breaks through the door of a diner, that was cool. The soft rock soundtrack was quite good.

It tries to combine several teen exploitation genres together in one movie and fails quite dramatically. Others have reviewed the movie's myriad flaws much better than I can here, but I want to point out something that none I've read seem to have noticed.Where the heck did most of the characters go? There are several points in the film where people simply vanish from the movie. The kids on the boat are gathered in the dance room by the teacher. Then the teachers and the main characters flee the boat without going to check on them. The only thing said about it is there is no restaurant when the teacher asks about the other kids. Also, the female teacher dies in a car explosion for no apparent reason. They just leave her in the car when everyone gets out. I guess she just didn't feel like being in the rest of the movie. Can't blame her.Another simple thing. The makers of this movie must really hate New York people. The people are possibly the coldest and most non-reactive people to ever witness a murder. I lived in NY. This kinda stuff in times square would not stand. One last flaw. Since when can Jason teleport? There were more than a few times when someone was running away only to find him already at the other end of a flight of stairs or on top of a ladder or inside a room when he was right behind them a second ago. There's even one scene where a teen looks up and sees Jason at the top of some stairs, then looks at the bottom and he's there too. He's supernatural, but not that supernatural. It takes away from the running as fast as I can but he keeps gaining on me suspense of a thriller.Overall, this movie had some OK death scenes but no discernible plot or intelligence. The boat was a dumb idea for a location. NY was even worse. The subplot about the girl and her visions and the jerk teacher was dumb and never bore any fruit. Don't even get me started on the stupid attempt to portray a high school graduation party. The ending...what?So 3 stars. Watch for laughs, otherwise don't bother.

Let's face it, the storyline goes like this '¬£@%¬£! Jason's back! Everybody scarper!' in all the movies. Part 8 is unafraid to have a self-deprecating laugh at itself, and uses some interesting settings to liven things up a bit.As such, it stands head and shoulders above the frustrating Jason Goes To Hell and the later but equally annoying Freddy vs Jason, as instead of trying to reinvent the slasher genre (an unwise move at best, never aided if you're a pretentious jerk with it, which is what killed both of them for me) JTM just builds on it and sets it some off-kilter places.The title is a tad misleading, but I find it unlikely anybody truly expected Friday to make it somewhere as upmarket as NY for a WHOLE film. Jason does indeed reach Manhattan eventually, but he doesn't so much take all of it as the docks, a train and a few run-down buildings. All the same, the settings, also involving a boat full of grad students which takes up the lion's share of the film, give the movie a much needed injection of energy.It really helps it, too. This movie is damned infectious. After an initially creaky opening, Jason kicks into high gear, and the movie flies out of the stalls at full whack. There really isn't much time to catch your breath once the movie's going, and only the most miserable of misery-guts could help getting swept along with it. Yeah there's a few clich√© characters, yeah I still really don't know how Jason managed to get up that staircase that fast given he was BEHIND the guy earlier, but this is a horror movie, not a heavy duty drama. As such it excels, and it feels good to be able to say that this is a rad movie, well worth your time.

I first saw this myself several years ago and thought it was appalling but I have now given it the benefit of the doubt and revisited it for a bit of mindless mayhem before I went to bed. And I have to admit, I now see it in a more positive light. Sure, it's derivative and formulaic as hell but it at least attempts to do something different with this franchise. Not only that but it's paced pretty well with a steady stream of Jason antics and ridiculous moments.The story in a nutshell has the supernatural lunatic Jason Voorhees reanimated by an underwater electric cable. Pretty soon he stows aboard a cruise ship of teenagers on their way to New York and you can more or less guess what happens next.The principal differentiating factor with this entry in the series is the move from Camp Crystal to a cruise ship and then Manhattan itself. This change of scenery does the film some favours, ensuring that the usual Voorhees slasher violence has a new setting at least. To be fair, despite this change this is strictly business as usual, with a plethora of killings all carried out in a slightly different way. A couple of standouts being a heavy metal chick killed by a pink flying-v guitar and a boxer sparring with Jason on a New York rooftop only to have his head literally punched off. The cast of characters is your usual bunch of teenage stereotypes and we also have veteran actor Peter Mark Richman put in an amusing performance as a spectacularly unreasonable teacher; at one point in a flashback he even shoves a little girl who can't swim into Crystal Lake &#x96; Boo! Hiss! Overall, despite the fact its derivative nonsense, this is actually quite fun nonsense.

Unfortunately, the results were much less than anticipated, for PART 8 emerged as a renowned disappointment; Jason only arrives in New York for the end portion of this movie, and even then most of the action was filmed in some dirty back alleys of Canada which substituted for Manhattan (though what little footage actually occurs in The Big Apple is welcome). The first hour takes place on a cruise ship where the resurrected masked zombie terrorizes a group of students and their adult teachers en route to New York for a graduation celebration. Kane Hodder returns to the part of Jason for his second of four appearances. His patented methods of murdering his victims are occasionally effective, though they still come off as compromised under the watchful cutting eyes of the MPAA. Young actors Jensen Daggett and Scott Reeves don't show much personality as the ho-hum leads, and even old veteran Peter Mark Richman doesn't act very convincingly. Still, there is something to be said for taking the action away from Jason's same old stomping grounds.

The reason is that the time spent in Manhattan is virtually nil. The last half hour is actually in New York considering how much time is spent hyping it up like its Jason lose in the big city (which is an interesting concept I think.) But this is about Jason lose on a boat of High School graduates on their way to New York. It takes the typical Crystal Lake location and mixes it up by putting him on a boat and then truly mixes it up by dropping him into the biggest city in North America. Such intense change in setting is welcomed and interesting and makes the kills that much more fun. This is also the first time I felt like they added a hint of humour to the series with Jason showing his face to some gang bangers to get them to back off. It also has my hands down favourite Friday the 13th kill ever and perhaps the most ridiculous with the boxer on the roof when Jason takes his head clear off with a hook after being punched multiple times. The characters haven't changed much over the course of eight Friday the 13th films but the setting is what makes this one more fun than the average instalment.Jensen Daggett is our latest scream queen and this was her premier role. She is good as Rennie, the emotionally distraught Graduate whose parents were killed, and who was traumatized as a child by nearly drowning. She has that typical deer in the headlights scared of everything performance we have come to know of the lead female in the Friday the 13th series. Barbara Bingham plays Rennie's teacher and one of the only adults in the film and she is a great character but they don't give her enough screen time. A legendary television actor, Peter Mark Richman plays Principal Charles McCulloch. His character is one of the best and he does a great job in the role. Scott Reeves is the young love interest and hero. I think he is actually one of the best actors that played this type of role in the series. He actually has personality and a strong charisma on screen. And its only right that I mention Vincent Craig Dupree who plays the previous mentioned Boxer who doesn't get a lot of screen time but he is good when he's on screen. Kane Hodder picks up the hockey mask again and proves why he is the best at being Jason. His movements are just so defined and perfect for Jason.Another man from the Friday the 13th TV Series takes the helm, Rob Hedden. He also co-write Jason Takes Manhattan and I think these directors that truly care about this series want nothing more than to try and really give it a story because Jason Takes Manhattan tries very hard to actually have a solid plot amongst the insane deaths and kills. The one thing I could have done without entirely was the constant flashbacks to Jason as a child and the ending which for some twisted reason as Jason melting down back to being a child again. IMDb writers pass this off as visions by Rennie but even still it comes across as ridiculous. Regardless this is one of the best stories and the most fun seeing Jason Voorhees run around a populated city...a fish out of water (no pun intended.)

(like in every Friday the 13th ever) The boy in it tells his girlfriend about the legend of Jason Voorhees, and she is worried. However, he isn't bothered by it. They throw an anchor down in Crystal Lake which catches Jason underwater tied up in loads of chains. The anchor is then hit with lightning, bringing Jason back to life. He kills the two teenagers and then the movie really starts.The next day we see high school grads on a boat on a trip to Manhattan. All of a sudden, the killing start up. Everybody suspects it is Jason, but the trip organiser is not convinced. They round up weapons and try and chase Jason down, but nearly everyone gets killed. Some of the grads and parents manage to get away on a dinghy, but Jason follows them to Manhattan without the people knowing.They arrive at Manhattan, where Rennie (the main character behind Jason) is kidnapped. The rest of the gang try to find here, but along the way 3 of the gang are killed, along with a police officer. The two survivors (Rennie and Scott) manager to avoid Jason for a while, before finally killing him with a bucket of acid to the face then finally being finished off with thousands of litres of water wiping him, turning Jason back to the deformed child he was.All in all, this movie rocked. Great deaths, (such as Julius getting his block knocked off by Jason), great story, great acting, and great setting! This movie definitely deserves ten stars.

Jason","Date":"3 August 2006","Score":"8 out of 15 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":" Friday the 13th Part VIII Jason Takes Manhattan takes a brave step in a new direction, with pretty unintentionally hilarious results. Part VIII is the instalment which most people seem to enjoy slating, however I think that it is one of the better sequels. From the overly stereotypical teenagers, to the fantastically inventive locations and death scenes, Part VIII offers much more than just Jason's gruesome slayings, and is therefore better for it. The plot is very basic; Jason boards a luxury cruiser full of teenage college graduates on their way to New York. As sexual activities and drug abuse ensues aboard the boat, Jason slashes his way through the entire load of passengers, leaving just a handful of characters to roam around the Big Apple as he continues his stalk. The characters in this movie are fantastic; J.J. the weirdly sexy punk guitarist, Tamara the hot bitch, Evie the naive girl-friend, etc. Once again the Friday the 13th series doesn't fail to bring to our attention a wonderful array of weird and hilarious people to watch be killed off. The death scenes are brutal and inventive in this movie, however for a later sequel the gore and blood seems very trimmed, so you are left feeling cheated, as the gore is much more toned down and very tame. We're talking about the annoying way the camera cuts away as somebody is about to be killed, so all we see is a blood splatter, or a shadow, or a pained face, etc., so the gore is a great letdown. The script in this movie is also very painful, and the characters all seem to be spouting a load of unwitty nonsense at times. In this instalment we also get to see Jason as a young child as well, as background and past stories are weaved into the main plot, both between Jason Voorhees and Rennie, the main heroine of this sequel. The soundtrack to this instalment is upgraded to punk-rock, and gives it a less creepy, tense feel, but is actually blended well with the dank back alleys of New York. There are plenty of plot holes in this movie. The way New York is over-exaggerated as being a shithole is quite unrealistic, but it does go well with the whole gruesome, dark Jason theme. Overall Part VIII is rather loose and could have been much better if we'd have seen more of Jason actually in New York.

So the film involves Jason going to Manhattan like in the title but they spend the whole run time and the boat and the last 14 minutes are in Manhattan it should have been called Jason takes a boat oh and Manhattan is at the end. Plus it's one of the most boring films I have seen and no tension is built for the kills and why does Jason teleport is he Night crawler. The characters are stupid and just horrible people and some of the worst characters I have seen in a horror movie and that's saying something about how bad this film is it sucks.So the film has Jason get awoken by some boat and he kills some people the end nope there is more oh god why. Then we see some girl board a ship and Jason just like a bad ass climb up the side fair enough then the killings begin and that's the whole film until the end when Jason arrives in Manhattan and at that point you just want to die why doesn't Jason just kill all the other people in Manhattan instead he wants the main characters who were on the boat. Why there some of the most fake people I have seen in any film and yes the acting is bad in horror films but boy this was dreadful and the ending what happened so Jason is turned into a little boy with toxic goo am done.The film is unwatchable don't put your self though that torture unless you get of to it then sure why not go watch the film but you won't get that 1 hour and 40 minutes of your life back.

Worse yet, Jason just doesn't seem that scary or menacing either walking through the corridors of a cruise ship or stomping around urban back alleys. On the plus side, the fetching Jensen Daggett contributes an appealing portrayal as troubled aspiring writer Rennie, tasty blonde Sharlene Martin has a deliciously snarky ball as stuck-up conniving bitch Tamara, Peter Mark Richman likewise excels as slimy and pompous jerk Charles McCulloch, and the boffo big rooftop confrontation between Jason and cocky boxer Julius (played with swaggering brio by V.C. Dupree) climaxes with a choice juicy decapitation. Passable, but it could (and should) have been a lot better.

And many of these kills are very memorable to say the least.Friday the 13th Part VIII Jason Takes Manhattan has some good talents on the cast list, which includes Kane Hodder, Kelly Hu, Peter Mark Richman and Jensen Daggett.While this is somewhat of a fish out of water, it is still a memorable part in the Friday the 13th legacy.

After Jason kills the captain, the ship is drifting across the Atlantic, set on fire, and only a few survivors make it in a lifeboat to New York where the chase continues...On one hand, part 8 is the best looking sequel so far. Cinematographer Bryan England achieves a great look, obviously influenced by 80s rock music videos. Even if the surroundings are different, a ship and Manhattan instead of the familiar forest, Jason continues his usual line of work and kills in interesting ways. My favorite is the boxing scene on a roof his opponent hits Jason about 30 times, until he is totally exhausted, and then Jason only hits once! On the other hand, poor characters and unlikely story. After part 7 attempted to present a different type of heroine, part 8 goes back to the nice girl in distress who gets good marks at school, opposed to the bad kids who take drugs. And then there are lacks of credibility. The kids are rowing a boat across the foggy Atlantic for many miles, the waters are as calm as in a swimming-pool, and they arrive straight at the feet of Lady Liberty - come on...

Basically a year has passed since previous events, two graduating high school students are on a houseboat on Crystal Lake getting frisky, then the anchor is weighed and causes an underwater cable to snap, and the electric charge causes the corpse of killer Jason Voorhees (Kane Hodder) to resurrect, he finds a new hockey mask and quickly kills the two occupants. The next morning a senior class of graduating students from Lakeview High School, chaperoned by biology teacher Charles McCulloch (The Naked Gun 2¬Ω The Smell of Fear's Peter Mark Richman) and English teacher Colleen Van Deusen (Barbara Bingham), are setting sail on the SS Lazarus, bound for New York City. McCulloch's niece Rennie Wickham (Jensen Daggett) has aquaphobia, and has heard all the legends of killer Jason when he was drowned as a child, every now and then she has been seeing visions of the young disfigured child Jason. Slowly strange and nasty things start happening to the people on the ship, both students and crew, McCulloch does not want to hear that Jason Voorhees is to blame, but of course once he sees the violence for himself and the actual maniac in the flesh, he thinks different. After many killings, the surviving passengers aboard, McCulloch, Van Deusen, Rennie, Sean Robertson (Scott Reeves), Toby the dog (Ace) and Julius Gaw (Vincent Craig Dupree) abandon ship and escape in a lifeboat, leaving Jason behind presumably dead, they are relieved when they finally reach the dock and outskirts of New York City. Of course they are unaware that Jason is still alive and followed them all the way and is stalking them, Rennie ends up getting kidnapped by two punks and the group are split up, the punks are killed when Jason comes along. As the others are killed by Jason, it is revealed that Rennie's fear of water was caused by McCullough, he pushed her into the water of Crystal Lake as a child, hence her visions of Jason as a child, the killer chases his victims through Times Square and the subways. Jason's kills include stabbing with a harpoon barb, impaling, killing with an electric guitar, slamming a sauna rock into an abdomen, an axe in the back, decapitation in a single punch, incinerated in an exploding car, drowning in a barrel of waste and much more. In the end Jason chases the last survivors through the sewers, where toxic waste surrounds them, he is finally defeated by a splash of acidic waste, then the whole place is flooded as Rennie and Sean escape up the ladder, but Jason will return. Also starring Sharlene Martin as Tamara Mason, Martin Cummins as Wayne Webber, Tim Burr Mirkovich as Young Jason, Amber Pawlick as Young Rennie, Gordon Currie as Miles Wolfe, X-Men 2's Kelly Hu as Eva Watanabe, Saffron Henderson as J.J. Jarrett, Warren Munson as Admiral Robertson, Tiffany Paulsen as Suzi Donaldson and Todd Caldecott/Shaffer as Jim Miller. Jason is still sinister, but the moment just after his defeat - seeing him as a child, and a few times throughout in visions, is ridiculous, there are a few good bloody deaths, but not enough, also the Big Apple is only seen a little with the lights in the dark, it is more so set down the dark alleys and beneath, to be honest I didn't find this sequel as good as I hoped it would be, but it's not a bad horror.

He is now played by Kane Hodder, who played him in the last film, and would play him for the next two films with Ken Kirzinger, taking his place as Jason in the crossover between this franchise and the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise, released in 2003, FREDDY vs. JASON.The story is amazing and in fact, if this movie was badly received by critics, I would not have watched this film at all. But I won't hate on it like the critics did, but I will say what is my main criticism is The Friday THE 13th theme by Harry Manfredini is missing from this movie and it is just sad. I will admit the new music by the new composer is simply fantastic and amazing.The costume design and production design is just fantastic in this film, so as the Jason mask for this film. The visuals are fantastic and a lot of people hates this film, but it is really amazing. The fans and critics hate this film, but this movie has it's share of fans and I happen to be a fan of this one.Kane Hodder plays Jason Voorhees again and he does an amazing job with the screen time he has. The rest of the actors are amazing as well, but their acting skills are not as bad, it's just that some of the dialogue written for them could have been better.Overall, Jason Takes Manhattan is my second favorite of the Friday the 13th films and this is one of six films that I think that are really cool and are on my list of JASON films that I like.Here they are &#x95; Friday the 13th (2009) reboot, directed by Marcus Nispel &#x95; Freddy vs. Jason (2003), directed by Ronny Yu &#x95; Friday the 13th (1980), directed by Sean S.

Jason Takes Manhattan however pushed me to the limit, because this one really doesn't make a lick of sense. I know that's a common go-to criticism for a horror movie, but I'm aware unstoppable zombie serial killers who get revived by electric jolts probably don't really exist. I'm talking about the inherent logic of this movie.For one thing I know the filmmakers have been playing around with Jason's pace ever since the beginning, making him appear wherever they want him to. We've accepted that Jason is clearly a lot quicker once he's off-camera, but this one doesn't play fair. The worst offender is probably the scene where the stepfather is running from a strolling Jason, then enters a house only to find Jason waiting for him there. He can teleport now? If you're going to make him teleport, what's the point of all the chase sequences? There's no suspense if Jason catches you whenever he wants to.Little things that don't make sense, but just happen because the movie says so are a real plague here. The very premise is flawed. Jason boards a ship that's supposed to bring a high school class to New York, but why would he do that? Why leave Crystal Lake now, after all these years/movies? And how on earth can you reach New York via a lake? Writer/Director Rob Hedden makes absolutely no effort in providing some kind of explanation to cover all this up, because he's going to put Jason on Times Square by any means necessary.Any means necessary also includes Jason simply swimming to New York once the ship sinks, the remaining characters splitting up in New York's worst neighbourhood because...Lord knows, vats op toxic waste that just stand around on the street, and Jason suddenly being able to walk past herds of people without trying to kill any of them. Killing everything that moves is just about Jason's only character trait, and they couldn't even get that right.All this would be somewhat forgivable if the movie was at least entertaining, but the kill scenes are just boring. We've seen this dude ripping people's hearts out, so seeing him sorta kinda strangle a girl makes him look like he's lost his touch. There's one holy grail is this pile of dung though at one point the token black kid engages into a long boxing match with Jason, with a predictable winner. This movie blows, but that is one of the highlights of the entire franchise.

However, this series made its fortune from repeating the same formula over and over again, so we get the same dull hack-and-slash hokum that came before. A more apt title would be Jason Takes a Boat Ride then Walks Around Manhattan for a Bit at the End. The film begins with a young couple frolicking on a boat, where the young boy tells the girl the story of Jason Voorhees (Kane Hodder), the deformed mass murderer responsible for the death's of many a teenage archetype. Jason, having been left chained to the bottom of the lake at the end of the previous film, is freed when the boat sails over some underwater cables, resurrecting Jason with electricity. Naturally, the young couple are butchered and Jason is on the loose again. Meanwhile, the SS Lazarus is bound for New York City and young aquaphobe Rennie (Jensen Daggett) is boarded, much to the annoyance of her uncle and stick-in-the-mud biology teacher Charles McCulloch (Peter Mark Richman). Rennie is plagued by visions of a young deformed boy, and soon enough the mutilated corpses of teenagers start to appear.Notice how Manhattan is not mentioned once in the synopsis. Whether it was for budgetary reasons or plain bad writing, Jason's feet don't touch land until the final act. So the opportunity for Jason to be let loose in a city that may just be as deranged as he is - leaving a trail of guts in his wake - is wasted, choosing instead to have Jason chase the leads around smoky back-alleys. When Jason finally stumbles through Times Square barely noticed by passers-by, it's an amusing moment and proves what a wasted opportunity this was. The rest of the movie consists of the same slasher routine as every entry that came before, only less inventive and featuring characters even more grating than usual. Possibly the worst in the series, yet the franchise would somehow prevail.

This entry however is no worse than some others, particularly part 5. One aspect of this film that keeps it true to the Jason formula is that is retains the functions of most of the films - Jason going around killing a bunch of teens. The difference is however that it isn't set a Camp Crystal Lake, but aboard a cruise ship and for a short while Manhattan (yes, despite it being called Jason Takes Manhattan there isn't a lot of screen time in New York). The usual rules of Jason are broken in parts 5 and 9 most notably.Heralded Jason performer Kane Hodder returns for his second voyage (excuse the pun), and does his job well. Interestingly, like part 7, this entry also has a demanding male authority figure in that of Charles McCulloch, played well by Peter Mark Richman, and a kind yet uncommanding female authority figure in teacher Collen van Deusen, played by the lovely Barbara Bingham. The heroine and hero in this film are pretty good, particularly hottie Scott Reeves as hero Sean. Jensen Daggett plays heroine Rennie, and while she is not as bad as certain heroines, there have been more interesting ones. Also look out for a pre-fame Kelly Hu as Eva, one of the more interesting teens. Aside from the ill-fated two who accidentally resurrect Jason at the start of the film, the rest of the teens are utterly forgettable.A reason this film doesn't work so well would be the connection Rennie has to Jason, that she saw him drowning when she was just a child. But this is of course illogical, as it would make her over 50 years old. Part 8 even has a crazy deckhand, who takes the role of Crazy Ralph from parts 1 and 2. At times, it is very painful to watch the early 90's outfits and hairstyles, particularly Rennies was awful. There is also a lot of drug use in the film which makes it seem more 80's like (despite the clothing and hairstyles). Like some of the earlier films, there is also a dog in this one too, a rather nice one at that.At times it feels like you are watching a music video especially the opening/closing song (which is quite good), but at other moments in the film as well. This was also the last film by Paramount Studios, which may be why the ending in which Jason is reduced to a child after being covered in toxic waste is ignored for film number 9. I should also point out that there is a lot less sex and nudity in this film than the previous and future. I would seriously advise that if you wanted to watch a Friday the 13th film for the first time, you avoid this and check out parts 1, 2 or 7.

The setting of a cruise ship and a fairly reasonable attempt to replicate New York was a good start, but once again, the lack of a good story or credible actors dooms the overall effect.This was also the last FT13 film that Paramount paid for. One wonders if it was because they were tired of being punished at the box office for their inability to fight with the MPAA, or simply because they were tired of trying to publicise the results. Either way, the dramatic improvement, quality wise, that the series took after it was out of Paramount's hands is quite amusing to note.Either way, this marks Kane Hodder's second outing as the hockey-masked wildman, and it is certainly one of his more credible offerings. Unlike every other Jason, Kane actually looks the part of someone who spent his entire childhood living in the woods, as the canon would have us believe. The problem here is that thanks to the MPAA and Paramount, he is given sadly little to do that sticks in the mind of the audience as memorable.The support cast are once again as convincing as Peter Jackson promising to respect the integrity of a story. Even the stereotypes they follow seem so hopelessly out of date that one wonders if the FT13 writing staff weren't given a chance to take a peek at some Days Of Our Lives plot lines. However, by far the most irritating support character would be McCulloch. One would think that the writers would have watched a few of the Nightmare On Elm Street films and learned how to write unidimensional adult characters. Sadly, it is a trademark of the FT13 series to plaigarise from everyone for every reason, except when they actually should. The deckhand is a good example of this. Did they really think that borrowing from parts one and two would erase the general suck factor of this installment?Another big problem with this film is how little credit it gives the audience for its intelligence. Sewers filling with toxic waste every evening at a certain time is bad enough, but if this really did take place, one has to wonder at how easily accessible our cast find the tunnels. One also has to wonder exactly where the police force would have been whilst this man is wandering from store to store, smashing everything as he goes. I was under the impression that the NYPD was quite substantially armed, and had enough hardware to separate Jason's molecules if so desired.In the end, I gave FT13 part eight a one out of ten. The suitable for everyone plays at gore really wear thin here. It's like watching porn without a money shot. Save your money and see an Evil Dead film instead.

Only for die hard fans.","Date":"23 August 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Horror","Review":"  In 1989 the Slasher genre was living extra time and the Friday the 13th franchise (once the most popular Horror movies) needed a complete re - structure in order to survived. It was decided that the Jason character should have a decent ending so Paramount ended with the franchise with a big budget movie Jason Takes Manhattan. Jason wasn't required in the 90's by the executives so he found his death in Manhattan. Everybody knows that five years later New Line bought the rights of the Friday the 13th movies in order to create the epic battle between Jason and their biggest money creator Freddy Krueger, but that's another story.*SPOILERS* Jason sneaks into a s*** filled with high school graduates and kills them one by one until only three of them and two teachers are left and escape the ship's explosion. Jason survives the explosion and follows the survivors to Manhattan. Once there Jason kills anyone that stands on his way and finds his death in the Big Apple sewers. There's not much to say about this entry. The new thing is that Jason changes his killing location from Camp Crystal Lake to Manhattan. The killings are the same, the teens are the same, and he's even the same.There are some good moments though (may only be appreciated by fans of the series). The storms looked cool and the creepy atmosphere inside the ship was good. Jason looked very mean and his costume rocked. Julius' death is something we've never seen in the series. Jason's morphing at the end is weird and disturbing. How would he turn out into a child again?! Insane and unnecessary. Weird but I don't like it. Kane Hodder reprises his role as Jason Voorhees and I must say that he kicks ass. He gave Jason an attitude and in this movie he shows a powerful display of anger. Jensen Dagget (Renny) is very beautiful and delivers a good performance. The other cast members are just regular. The death scenes aren't very creative but at least tried. There's stabbing, burning, impalement, decapitations, head smashings, choking, etc. There's a lot of job for Jason this time. There's a decent amount of gore, a good score, a good direction, and a nice welcomed atmosphere in the series. The new locations gave fresh air to the tired franchise. Good decision, Jason couldn't stay forever in Camp Crystal Lake and it's nears.JASON TAKES MANHATTAN tries too hard but doesn't manages to stay a solid entry in the series. The late 80's standard for making Slasher movies was high and sadly this movie couldn't top it. JTM is an entertaining Slasher movie that stands out from the rest only for having Jason in Manhattan and being Jason's last movie in Paramount. That's it. Watch it only if you're a die hard fan of the series.7/10 in the Friday the 13th scale. 5/10.

For one thing, a boat is much larger than a plane, and often larger than a train.  You also have multiple paralell means of travel within the boat, so you don't have to spend half your time trying to come up with silly, novel ways for characters to get from one part of the conveyance to another.This movie doesn't make much use of those advantages, however.  Instead, it seems to take place in 3 or 4 spots on the boat, only briefly visiting any of the rest.  When you consider that the ship offers literally hundreds of places for teens to run screaming, Jason to stand menacingly, and general mayhem to take place, it seems absurd that all the characters involved would spend so much of their time concentrated in such a small region.You'd also sort of think, given the title, that Manhattan would play a more prominent role in the film.On the whole, it's just a mediocre film.  Nobody involved seems to be trying, and that leaves you as a member of the audience feeling just a wee bit neglected.

Big mistake on his behalf since he electrocutes Jason back to life (how much more cheese would you like on that pizza?). So Jason kills those two for just plain stupidity on their behalf. He then takes the boat (which is supposed to be in a lake, but we later find out that it is on an ocean or something much much much much bigger than a lake) and plows it into another oceanliner and starts making hell on that ship. One by one that kids die on their senior vacation to the Big Apple. A few students, the teacher and the principle make it off the boat into a lifeboat (which shouldn't be lowered if the boat is still moving and since they didn't stop the engines, that would have caused the lifeboat to be sucked underneath the ship). The somehow pull off making it to New York City where Jason, being the Olympic swimmer he is, meets them there. Now comes my favoriate part of the movie with the hockey mask sign. Tell me that wasn't the funniest part of the movie? It was great. Anyways, as they kids and the adults are trying to find the police, they run into the druggys, which eventually get killed, and finally run into one another and a cop. The cop, which only lasts a couple seconds before being killed as well, was useless. They start taking off down the sewer system which gets flooded by toxic waste every night at midnight (there goes our oceans). What luck these kids have!!! Jason gets 'killed' and transformed into a little kid again by this magic toxic slug. Terrible terrible terrible.I didn't understand how Jason picked up his teleportation thing.

Unfortunately it ended up taking it to a new degree of badness, but they at least tried to stay away from the formula and I have respect for people who try new things.--Jason seeing the poster of the hockey mask was TOO COOL for words!THE BAD--This movie is, simply put, wasted potential. Who else would've preferred to see Jason really take on Manhattan instead of wasting time killing people on a boat and then ending up in Manhattan and not killing hardly anyone? Also, I think the lead character had potential to be a more developed character as her past with Jason was kinda interesting, but it was a hardly used plot device.--The acting and characters were AWFUL. I can put it no other way - I wanted everyone in this movie to DIE. I even wanted JASON to die! His schtick is tired!--Why would the boat even go ahead with the sailing if they knew there was a storm coming? This would be acceptable if the captain and crew only found out there was a storm coming during the sailing, but this captain knew beforehand therefore the sailing should've never even gone ahead.--The kills in this movie are bloodless, unimaginative and boring. Usually I can expect from good kills from a crap Friday movie, but not Jason Takes Manhattan.--I would love to know how on EARTH Jason gets from place to place in this movie. One minute he's in an alleyway, the next at the top of a two-story building. And he's frickin' EVERYWHERE during the scene where he kills Kelly Hu. Also, how the goddamn hell did he get to bloody Manhattan by swimming so fast? Ridiculous! Jason can't teleport; he's still a human/monster/zombie/unkillable thing.--This movie is so boring and slow, it drags on even with a short running time. Did they really need that useless story with the muggers/rapists? What purpose did that stupid, overlong scene with the African-American dude keeping on punching Jason (I felt like that scene went on for two YEARS)?

Friday the 13th Part 8 Jason Takes Manhattan is...well, it's Part 8!  Jason doesn't quite take Manhattan.  In fact, he hardly spends any time there.  They did get him out of the woods though.  Jason sets sail aboard the cruise ship Lazarus (appropriately named) with the Crystal Lake graduating class, which gives him a lot of victims.  I do like the fact that it takes place on a boat.  It presents certain claustrophobic elements.  You simply can't run away from Jason so you have to face and attempt to kill him.  But, that element is never used properly.  Sadly, this is the only Friday the 13th movie I owned when I was younger so I watched it over and over again.  It's only now that I realize how terrible it is.  The how's of Jason's resurrection, his magical ability to appear and disappear at will (in the Kelly Hu death scene), and Jason's own death are pathetically explained.  Part 7 may be my least favorite, but this one is the worst film (Jason Goes to Hell doesn't even qualify as a Friday the 13th movie).  Kane Hodder is just as menacing in this, but the make-up guys can't match the look of the last film.  Any semblance of continuity ends here.

Since it was made in 1989, it has that retro 80's look. Once the 80's were over, it was the end of an era and the Friday the 13th movies were part of that.

Richman is known to me for his nice polite 1960s guest roles in TV like QM's The Invaders, The Outer Limits and Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea ... often acting with monsters and sci-fi hardware. The world has changed in 1989 (but oddly enough Richman has not aged that much?) and he has a scene with a woman and once he finally gets to New York some young thug calls Richman Dad, a rude remark about his age. Scenes of Richman running around 1989 New York, still after all these years being chased by fantastic evil ... that is something I remember with joy.When being viewed today, young people should be aware of what other fantasy material was being put out in the 1980s...well next to nothing was coming out, 1980s TV was the land of Dynasty and Dallas, so any cinema release that contained just some sci-fic, like Friday The 13th, was seen as special because TV had so little good fantasy material. This film would not be so special today.Other 1989 cinema released films such as Batman, Edge Of Sanity and Star Trek 5 The Final Frontier put 1989 in the position of being the best movie year of the 1980s.

In any case, it was kind of nice to have something different then the same old camp ground setting.The cast was nothing to get excited about, they did a pretty good job, given the subject matter.  I did really like Jensen Daggett as Rennie Wickham though, she is quite the looker!  Also, it was cool to see a young Kelly Hu in the film, best known perhaps for her role in The Scorpion King and the upcoming X-Men 2.  I've noticed that a lot of people seem to praise Kane Hodder's performances as Jason Vorhees.  I've got to ask What is there to praise him for?  All he does is walk around and kill people.  What kind of acting talent does that take?  I personally can't tell when Kane Hodder plays him or when it is someone else, I have to look at the credits to tell.I'm not really sure where I would put this one in comparison to the others.  I can't really say it was better, but I can't really say it was worse either.  There's some cool stuff to see in this film, but if you didn't like any of the previous films, I doubt you are going to find this one to be any different.  If you are a fan of the previous Friday the 13th films, the go right ahead and give this one a look.  I hope you enjoy it.

It isn't terrible at all! It has Kane Hodder playing Jason superbly, a great change of atmosphere and setting and a high body count. People also say it's virtually goreless. I can assure you that it's not. It's gorier than part 6 and part 7! The story has an electric cable bringing jason back to life and Jason boarding a ship on course for New York. He starts killing right from the start with some good deaths including a sauna rock shoved in the stomach, a head punched off and a head smashed into a pipe! Jason has super speed and is more brutal than ever as his body count reaches 18 by the end! The acting is terrible by the leads but in the 'Friday the 13th' tradition of starting off careers it introduced a young Kelly Hu who went on to star with Sammo Hung in 'Martial Law'. Great scenes include the fight between Jason and Julius, and future Jason, Ken Kirzinger, being thrown across a New York cafe into a mirror. Overall, it will keep you entertained throughout no matter how dodgy you might find it.

But it isnt the change of venue that kills this film, most people dont care where its shot as long as they get to see Jason hacking up some teenagers, but what is there to say when you dont even get to see that?!? Now the version i saw was the DVD release from paramount, and believe me, they`ve done more slashing than Jason ever has. Theres not any gore in this movie, not thats worth mentioning anyway, and the death scenes are hacked to pieces. It`s probably not that hard to get a hold of an uncut version of this film and if you do please watch it! But do not, NOT! Waste your money on the dvd, just rent this movie or buy it uncut if you can. This movie probably has the worst and most stupid old guy that tells everybody that theyre gonna die actor i`ve ever seen in a horror movie and that says a whole lot ;) And what the hell is with the morphing?!? Has Jason entered a secret pact with the star trek enterprise or something? One second he`s right in front of you the next second he`s 20 feet above you!

However, what you do get is one of the better sequels in the series set on a cruise ship for the most part and alot of screen time given to jason always a good thing. Kane Hodder is back as jason and gives his most menacing perfomance to date from the three films he had starred in up to that point. Despite some negative reviews and complaints about a low body and gore count, the film stands out for being the only film to take jason away from crystal lake, and is all the better for it. Anyway, the body count is high enough clocking in at 20 kills, the second highest of the series if i'm not mistakenand some kills quite inventive, one of the best being the boxing match on a new york rooftop. True the gore is low compared to previous films but there is enough to satisfy. The film also moves at a fast pace jumping straight into the action, after a small flashback sequence jason is re-animated by an electrical shock from an underwater power cable and begins his killing spree. There are some complaints about the film to be made though,1 like the fact that on a number of occasions jason seems to be able to appear in different places at the same time, ExampleJason appears at one end of a hall to scare a soon to be dead teen, said teen turns around and runs down a set of stairs to another floor, turns a corner and there jason is ready to kill. 2 The part of the bitter uncle was also annoying and deserved a much more gruesome death than he got. 3not enough nuditycome on, this is a jason film and I expect major boobage. 4I missed Harry Manfradini's classic music score. On the plus side, Jennson Dagett is REALLY hot the hottest heroine of the seriesand gives a good performance. Jason is in this movie alot a mistake made by jason goes to hell was to not not have him in it for most of the movie So to sum up I would have to say that this is on par with part 6 for being the best of the sequels have not seen jason x yet but i can't waitand most certainly not as bad as some people would have you think. 7.5/10  "}{"Title":"Help","Date":"8 June 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Horror","Review":"               Jason returns to kill love struck diapered teens again.This film is one of the weaker of the ten films.The orginal camp is full of shadows,woods,etc.The fear of Jason behind every tree or brush made parts 2-4 the best of the series.The film has a few scares but not enough.The uncle is horrible to watch.

In this movie alone he survives being shot 5 times, being stabbed in the eye with a pen, being hit with a car(!), being electrocuted and being punched repeatedly in the face and body.2- For a boxer, Julius has remarkably low stamina. He should have been able to go on for a least a little longer with Jason. Maybe he was tired3- Nobody seems to notice Jason (or care) as he walks througha) a (somewhat) crowded subway trainb) Times Square How could you not notice a very slimy, probably quite smelly, creepy looking guy with a hockey mask.4- Has Jason suddenly become Darth Vaders long lost cousin? His breathing throughout the movie seems to indicate this.With the above comments aside I found this to be a most entertaining and watchable movie with some hidden humour. The body count may be low and the gore, nudity and sex somewhat minimal, but its fun neverthless. Especially memorable is the scene were Jason goes one on one with Julius, the boxer and literally knocks his block off. A most fun way to spend and evening.

As a horror movie, it sank quicker than the Titanic, because a lot of things just don't hold water for Jason fans.  To begin with, Jason leaves Crystal Lake.  WHY?

If he leaves his territory, what right does he have to kill on New Yorkers' territory, hmm?Plus Jason is on a boat with teens, whom he is stalking.  Does this sound like the antithesis of Die Hard, or even remotely like Under Siege to anyone?  Hey if Segal and Willis can do it, why not Jason?The make up job on Jason stinks as well.  When do eyes migrate?  Any Friday fan will tell you that Tommy Jarvis hit Jason on the left side of his head with a machete, resulting in the loss of Jason's LEFT eye.  In parts six and seven, the continuity showed us that Jason has one working eye, and it's the RIGHT one,  BUT in part eight, it shows the scar left by the machete that took his left eye, but when h pulls off his mask, we find that he still HAS the left eye, and his RIGHT one is gone.

I think the biggest problem is that a prospective viewer might expect a lot more Manhattan action because of the title. If it had been called, say, JASON TAKES A CRUISE, your reaction after seeing it might have been wow, that's a neat change of pace...and I think it was really cool seeing Jason in Manhattan at the end! I didn't expect that! If a good movie like GONE WITH THE WIND had been called something like ADVENTURES IN HAWAII (I know I'm exaggerating) would that change what was actually in the film itself?Jason continues doing what he does best dispatching teens in inventive new ways for no reason other than that's what he likes to do. This is all I expect from a FRIDAY film, and it is what I got from this one. I also like the ways Jason gets revived in the later films. It reminds me of the old classic Frankenstein films.The acting is weak in this one, that is for certain. There are some goings-on which don't seem to make sense, like the boy image of Jason which keeps popping up. To my mind, I think that this is the way the lead girl views Jason. Whenever she thinks of him, she sees a boy version of him. If you look at it this way, the ending makes more sense because it's only in the girl's troubled mind that she sees the image of a boy. To anybody else that would view the body, it's just our favorite hockey-masked thug. When Jason meets his end, for our leading lady it also ends her hallucinations.It's true that the movie doesn't deliver when expecting more from its title. But as a person living close to the city, I'm glad they filmmakers tried a different approach in the Big Apple.

Thats what made this Friday seem disconnected, having Jason so mean.  Ok, so he wasnt nice to begin with, but at least he sent his victims to a quick grave which is what made the filmsfun. Here he's more heartless than usual, a big mis-step by writer/director Hedden.  People slowwwwly drowned in toxic waste, or slowwwly choked, or the girl who has her head slammed into a mirror and then has Jason hover over her with a glass shard raised in the air as she screams forever until finally killed.

In the old days his victims didnt have the chance to scream let alone say no.  Only two kills remotely resemble the old Jason, the head-punch-off and the sauna rock to the gut.

If you  look at it from that stand point then the  movie is going to be dumb. But I believe  that Hedden wanted this 7th sequel to not  be a typical slasher film like the ones  before it. This is why I think it is the  best of the series and a decent horror  movie. In my opinion this movie has tons  of irony and symbolism. If you notice,  each character Jason hacks off has  something they want to become. This is more of a  film about dreams, Jason seems to be  everywhere in this movie and he, more or  less, represents fate. It is there anytime  any place, you can run from it and it will  always find you. The dreams of these young  people will not happen and that is what  Hedden wants you to see. All  of this could be coincidence, but  let's look at the ending. Jason turns into  a child again. That has to be some kind of  symbolism otherwise it wouldn't make any  sense. Just like all the rest of the  people who parished on the Lazurus, this  shows Jason as being young and the fate  that led him up to that point.

Sound familiar?  It is.But Rob Hedden has directed what is perhaps the best of the Friday the 13th films with more style and imagination than earlier outings.  The Jason character is cast as a sort of anti-hero in this update of the series, and the result is a campy good time.Crystal Lake's graduating class are shipping off to New York for their class trip, and when Jason is accidentally revived from the bottom of Crystal Lake by an anchor which snags a power line, he climbs on board for the ride.  What ensues is a cruise to mayhem as many of the teens are slain en-route to the Big Apple, and the boat eventually sunk.  There's a lot of energy and kinetic camera work in this piece, nearly enough to revive the series to presentable level, and many of the killings almost come off as gags.Kane Hodder, affirming that he is, in fact, the *real* Jason Voorhees, resumes the role he took over in the previous film, and hams it up a bit on the streets of New York while remaining a menacing figure.  He frightens the dickens out of a street gang, proves that you should never touch the third rail of a subway, even marvels at his likeness on a New York Rangers billboard.The ending in the sewers is questionable at best, with Jason dissolved in acid while the spray never harms his cowering quarry, but Hodder is fantastic lurching around the subterranean corridors while clutching his steaming, monsterous face and wailing in pain.  Do zombies feel pain?Jason Takes Manhattan gives a fresh perspective on the old formula, with good, solid performances and a core cast of believable characters.  The fact that it *is* an old formula weighs greatly on this otherwise acceptable film, and the result is a middle of the road thriller that can finally stand almost eye-to-eye with other suspensers not cursed with a VIII in the title.On a side note  hardcore F13 fans typically despise this film, perhaps for its change of venue or relatively low body count.  Regardless, this is a film that delivers its share of frights and laughs, and of course, a measure of oh, yeah, rights.

Most of the characters are awful people, and as a viewer, you can either care more or less whether they live or die (half of them dies), but eventually, a small portion of the teenagers live and this leads into a decent ending in this film.Jason Voorhees is superbad in this one and he's not just a horror icon in this film and he is mad as hell. He is now played by Kane Hodder, who played him in the last film, and would play him for the next two films with Ken Kirzinger, taking his place as Jason in the crossover between this franchise and the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise, released in 2003, FREDDY vs. JASON.The story is amazing and in fact, if this movie was badly received by critics, I would not have watched this film at all. But I won't hate on it like the critics did, but I will say what is my main criticism is The Friday THE 13th theme by Harry Manfredini is missing from this movie and it is just sad. I will admit the new music by the new composer is simply fantastic and amazing. The costume design and production design is just fantastic in this film, so as the Jason mask for this film.

So one by one, the man in the hockey mask goes about doing his best at decreasing the surplus population. Of the entire series, this one is the most polished and professional-looking. Some of the deaths are really elaborate. There's also quite a few hallucinatory dream sequences involving Jason as a boy. (As a side note Why hasn't anyone ever questioned how Jason could drown as a boy, but come back as a hockey-masked adult?) Eventually, Jason and the survivors DO reach the Big Apple. But we only get to see Time Square once. The rest of the time, the cast stumbles around the seediest wharfs, the grimiest sewers, and generally just runs away helplessly from Jason. One teen actually tries boxing the crap out of him. But to no avail. Though I'm griping, this film is likable and entertaining. And it does bring things to a satisfying conclusion. If the studios hadn't made another sequel, this would've been a good place to leave the Jason series.

No surprise really as it's a classic case of a film with a completely misleading title. Having the undead masked serial killer, Jason Voorhees, slashing his way through New York sounds like a good idea for a film, right? Yes, you're right. However, the 'money men' behind the film didn't agree.For budgetary reasons they couldn't afford to shoot in the Big Apple until the final twenty minutes, leaving pretty much the whole film set on a boat heading to the city in question. Here we have the typical 'slasher' film, only on a boat instead of the traditional camp in the woods.So, fans were more than a little annoyed at the misleading nature of the film. Also &#x96; for no reason at all &#x96; Jason can now 'teleport.' One minute he's a hundred yards behind you, then next he's standing in front of you. Yes, he's a supernatural being, but no explanation is given for this new talent. Plus it does tend to spoil the 'chase' between killer and victim when no matter where and how fast you run, he just appears in front of you every time.So, Part 8 is a bit of a let-down in general. Yes, there are a few nice touches here and there and if you're a die hard fan of the series you'll probably appreciate it. However, although it's definitely watchable (if you're into this sort of film) it's not one of the better films in the franchise. Even the writer agrees that not enough time is spent in Manhattan and agrees with fans. Apparently, it was all down to the film's producers that they weren't allowed to spend enough time there.

Jason Voorhees gets resurrected again (I think by electricity or lightning), and continues his murderous rampage. This time he makes his way onto a ship which is hosting a graduation trip to New York for a local high school. Many of the characters are awful people, and as a viewer, you really care less whether they live or die (most of them die). Eventually, a small portion of the group latch onto a raft and float to New York City. Jason somehow gets to NYC (I think he must've walked there underwater or something). He kills a few more leading to up a decent ending in the sewers of the city.Jason Voorhees is super human in this one folks. He manages to move from one place to the next in the blink of an eye. One minute he's on the deck of the ship, the next he's standing in New York City. He like many other horror icons at this time, is no longer scary. He's a complete joke, a cartoon. There are some good parts to it though, like a guy getting his head punched off by the masked madman. And the scenes in Times Square and the New York subway were fun to watch. But getting through over an hour of Jason stalking the corridors of a cruise ship gets tedious after twenty minutes.The back story of Renny being pulled underwater by a young Jason when she was a kid makes little to no sense. Jason's age would have had to have been altered drastically for that to have been real. The finale in the sewer was the best thing in the film. Jason's face was very grotesque in this one. Friday the 13th fans, like myself, will slightly appreciate this for being a fun cheesy mess.

Finally you get to see the slashed scenes and that what was cut in order to get an R-rating. (from the 'evil empire' MPAA- I hate censorship !). But Part VIII wasn't trimmed as heavily as Part VII. The effects weren't so good to begin with. I LOVE the Friday The 13th franchise, especially the first four movies are awesome. (Part 1 and 4 had fantastic make-up effects by master Tom Savini). Part VII could have been better received but it was for many viewers a little bit of a disappointment due to the lack of bloody killings/special effects. A few minutes of gore was cut due to the MPAA. When you see those deleted scenes, it becomes an entire different (and way better) movie !! That cannot be said when it comes to Part VIII. It isn't a good movie to begin with, especially for the Friday fans there's a lot out of place here; - Young (and old unmasked) Jason looks nothing like the previous and especially first movie. - Jason can't swim, but here he seems to be in form. - Jason seem to move faster than lightning in this movie. - 4 people in danger decide to split up (?? really) - A black guy hits Jason's mask numerous times (?? how dumb is that) - Jason Takes Manhattan (only in the last 20 minutes..)So a couple of things were removed to get the R-rating, but it's nothing shocking. Even the scene of the darts-in-the-eyes can be seen which was eventually replaced by another scene. But it's just a couple of seconds of gore you get to see, like a close-up shot of the first murder. Or the girl in the shower lying with pieces of glass in her back. Friday VIII has annoying characters and little tension. Most things in the lame story make no sense at all. Thank God for Kane Hodder who plays Jason once again very well. But he can't save this movie for being below average. A lot of people don't like Part V, but I do, I thought that one was an excellent slasher movie. And really, Part V was way better than this one. But again, it's A Friday The 13th Movie so I own it.

You can see the slashed scene's on the disc but there wasn't that much gore in it as part 7. But for me the biggest mistake was as I told before bringing back young Jason.

In the first part, for example, the lake was entirely surrounded by deep woods, whereas in the third part, the area looked more like a swamp. Still, none of the films gave the impression that Crystal Lake was connected to any other waters, let alone a river that connects to the sea. Well,... guess what Good old Jason is resurrected once again by a teenage couple in a boat on Crystal Lake. After butchering the two lovebirds, Jason takes the boat to a nearby coastal small-town, where a bunch of teenagers as well as two teachers are planning a trip to New York on a cruise ship. Jason sneaks on board, of course, and his presence quickly reduces the number of teens on the ship...The Friday the 13th series is mainly a product of the 80s, and, shot in 1989, Friday the 13th Part VIII Jason Takes Manhattan is the last 80s Friday film. This film's setting on a cruise ship (which, considering its size, carries only very few people) is actually a good thing, in my opinion, as a ship is one of the most inescapable settings imaginable. And, at least in the beginning, Jason does what he does best with acceptable results. Sadly enough, Friday the 13th Part VIII Jason Takes Manhattan is once again relatively gore-less (which also was my main complaint about the previous part, New Blood. Most of the murders either let camera slide away when the good stuff happens, or are virtually gore-less. This is too bad, because, at least in my humble opinion, gore was probably the one thing the earlier entries to the series had to offer. Kane Hodder plays Jason again, which is good as he gives him a creepy and intimidating look. Jason's look is generally creepier in the later entries to the series, but the gore is still way too tame in this film for my tastes. The few gory sequences are pretty cool, though, especially one in which Jason punches a guy's head off his torso with his bare hands. Also, one could (once again) care less about any of the protagonists, as a viewer one isn't scared for them but eagerly waits for them to get butchered. The Jason makeup underneath the mask isn't impressive (it was very good in the previous part). Oh, and the ending is the stupidest thing ever.Personally I have always thought of the Friday series as extremely overrated by many of my fellow Horror fans, and this eighth part is one that can easily be skipped. The one thing that is applaudable is the new setting, which at least brings some kind of change. 3.5 out of 10 "},{"Title":"A poorly made film.","Date":"15 June 2009","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":" After the masterpieces that Part 6 and 7 turned out to be, I really had some high hopes with Part 8.

Eventually it gets boring and that will happen before they get off the boat.When Jason's on the cruise though, he doesn't seem to like to use his signature machete and chooses to kill with random things and objects that he finds lying around and plenty of them aren't even inventive.Have I mentioned that everyone in the movie are terrible actors and they provide the movie with so much unintentional humor that you will never take the movie seriously.When they finally get into Manhattan, everything about it feels fake.

For instance, it's very unlikely that the New York sewers fill up with toxic waste every night at midnight. ADSURD! I like Kane Hodder but he's makeup was really very awful.

Two teens on a yacht talking about the legend of Jason, they start to make out while there boat accidentally awakens Jason again with some electricity. Jason (Hodder) quickly dispatches them, grabs the kid's hockey mask and is on his way. We meet the main characters the next day about to board a cruise ship headed for New York. Rennie (Daggett) the main character, talks about her future with her favorite teacher Miss Van Deusen (Bingham). Her uncle, the principle Mr. McCulloch (Richman), the big ass of the film starts to rag on Rennie about everything and how he is disappointed about her coming. Meantime Rennie's man Sean (Reeves) is the captain's son, who is also disappointed with the youngster about not wanting to be a boat captain, sue me dad. So Jason climbs on board and some janitor of course knows more then the others to tell them they are all doomed. Soon we meet heavy metal girl and a nerd, the nerd is a must for most of these films. The metal chick goes to jam in the lower decks and soon has a flying v in her skull. In the meantime Rennie continues to have these silly visions of some boy and fear of drowning all connected to Jason. Even sillier is McCulloch on the senior trip asking for various forms of homework while they are supposed to be partying. The slutty girl of the film gives him a short biology lesson before she is cut to ribbons. Eventually Jason goes the through the kids one by one and after throwing the nerd on some electrical stuff, which starts a fire, those who are left have to abandon ship. After finally arriving in NY some thugs kidnap Rennie, but Jason also is there and kills them. Before going after her he boxes with Julius (laughable scene) and Jason punches his head off. Rennie escapes with Sean, confronts McCulloch about almost drowning her as a kid and they run off, while McCulloch is drowned head first in some toxic waste, one of the better parts of the film I might add. Jason start's to chase them through time square, diner, sub way, and eventually the sewers. Rennie manages to throw toxic waste on Jason's face making him melt and cry like baby, hilarious. The sewer cleans out, Jason wines like baby (laughable) the water drowns Jason and when it subsides he is transformed into a kid. Makes no sense but who cares Rennie and Sean walk off into time square with her dog to live anther day.Overall a bad film and one of the weaker ones in the franchise, however I admit that for some reason I tend to enjoy this one. One of the big problems as everyone mentions was the lack of Jason being in NY. Most people know that director Rob Hedden did not have the money to film in NY so much of the film is on a boat or in Vancouver for the city shots. And I think for the most part that works, but again Jason is there for maybe the last 20 minutes, so it's somewhat of a letdown. The acting as usual is really bad, even for a Friday film, with a few exceptions. Peter Mark Richman as McCulloch is the one who stands out. He plays the jerk of the film to perfection and his death is enjoyable. Most of the others seem to walk through their roles, Especially Scott reeves as Sean. He wines the whole time and is not believable for a second. For instance his dad is laying dead on the floor and he barley acts that upset. As for Hodder, I was never really big on him as Jason. I rather like the actor more then him as the character. But he is good in this.The story is weak as well, with the kids on the boat most of the movie, just a few survivors make it to NY. The worst part of the story is the nonsense with Rennie having flashbacks of her drowning and supposedly Jason was dragging her down as a kid while McCulloch her uncle, watched. It never works out and I think Jason would have been an adult when she was a child. The end is stupid too with Jason being turned into a kid at the end of the film. It makes no sense and looks likes crap. And how funny is having the principle come on the trip and asking for school crap and acting like he is the boss? As always the deaths are what people talk about and there are only a few good ones in this. I think most people like when Julius, one of the better characters from the film, eventually has his head punched off. Stupid but good. Let's see, toxic waste drowning, the steam rock in the gut, the wrench, the nerd on fire, but many more were just generic because they toned the whole movie down, not Robs fault. The MPAA edited up to much so again it's not Hedden's fault so I give him a break. The movie is better then Jason Goes to Hell, which was awful.

Not only is this film not well made or scary; It's not even entertaining! The movie starts out with an opening around New York City. The opening of the movie is actually pretty good, but it just makes the rest of the film seem terrible. We are then deported to Camp Crystal Lake when we see a young couple having sex on a large boat on the lake. Well, what do you know, Jason comes back to life AGAIN in the cheesiest, cheapest way you can imagine. Then the plot evolves, if you can even say this movie has a plot. Jason somehow ends up on a cruise ship that is somehow going from Camp Crystal Lake to New York. This is one part of the movie I couldn't get at all. It is not once mentioned in the series that Camp Crystal Lake is a bay or a river. How could a bout possibly get from a lake in the middle of nowhere to New York. It doesn't make sense to me.We are then introduced to a group of characters, who are the worst in the entire series. The acting isn't good at all. I expected much better acting considering the budget and the hype this movie had behind it. I think the only thing that made this movie good was the hype. Without the hype, this movie would definitely be considered the worst of all time. If I had to compare this movie with another slasher film, I would have to compare it to a watered down version of Slumber Party Massacre (which was terrible to begin with).The entire film actually takes place on a cruise ship, rather than New York City. New York isn't actually introduced until the last 15 minutes. This is another part of the movie I couldn't get; When there's a big guy walking down the sidewalk wearing a hockey mask and holding a bloody machete, wouldn't people panic? Guess not. Whatever. Well, because the plot (if you can say this movie has one) moves so slow, I found this movie to be incredibly poor and boring. I actually fell asleep on this movie 5 times.The only entertaining piece scene in this mess of the movie are the scenes in New York, which I somewhat enjoyed.

It wasn't such a bad idea because, let's be frank, seeing a psycho in a hockey mask kill naughty teenagers gets old after a while.

Fred Mollin is no Harry Manfredini, but his score gets the job done. A few great set pieces and scenes on the streets of Manhattan.

The opening kill scene is over- acted and not inspired, personally I could have done without the girl's annoying screeching....and that's the first 10 minutes!Then, the rest of the damn movie takes place on a boat. Except the last 15 minutes, in which Jason finally gets to New York, and even then nothing exciting happens.After forcing myself to sit through this one several times (thanks to the From Crystal Lake to Manhattan box-set), I still can't see it's appeal.

But i (along with everybody else who has seen the film) did feel lied to by the films title. If the title says Jason Takes Manhattan then how come only the last 36 minuets of the film is actually set in Manhattan. But this is still a very good movie. This is the one of the about two or three Friday the 13th films that even attempts to have any actual characters instead of just stick figures that get slaughtered in VVVVVVEEEEEEERRRRRRRYYYYY gruesome ways. The fact that most of the film is set on a cruise ship actually builds up the moment of the movie shifting to the streets of New York City.The death scenes are not as good or gorie as usual but the cruise ship is a great and fresh new setting for Jason to kill his new batch of teens who has previously limited to just a broken down summer camp. when the film finally does shift to New York the filmmakers do a very good job at showing Jason having a hard time trying to kill the remaining teens and also being confused by his new surroundings.the scenes of Jason chasing the remaining teens through Times Square (the scene where Jason knocks over the gang's boom box is great), the New York subway, and the sewers are outstanding.one thing that bothered me is that when the only 5 passengers on the ship that are still alive finally leave the ship they are a little to late. if they where smart they would after left the ship after maybe 2 or 3 of the passengers where found dead they would get the *fuck* of the boat immediately. The climatic scene where Jason is killed by toxic waste and the two survivors walk off into times square is strange but good none the less.I have heard so many complaints from fans of the series about this film not about taking place in New York that i will right this wrong by writing a version of the script that will be set entirely in New York.

But this time, Jason is going to take a trip to the Big Apple. When he aboard on a cruise ship with a full of graduating high school kids.Written and Directed by Rob Hedden made an flawed but surprisingly well made slasher film that is certainly less bloody than most. This one is nicely shot, well produced and even nostalgic. Some might called this, the best or the worst of the Friday the 13th series. But Hedden's script is preposterous, the connection between Rennie (Played by Jensen Daggett) and Jason doesn't always make sense. Unless she's graduated attending her 30 year Reunion (!) as a example. This would be the last Friday the 13th film to be produced at Paramount. Then later Jason Goes to HellThe Final Friday, Jason X and Freddy Vs. Jason was produced by New Line Cinema.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.851) transfer and an good-Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround Sound. DVD doesn't have no extras but the DVD Box Set from Friday the 13th series, it has an interesting commentary track by the director, interviews with the director & actorHodder and the original theatrical teaser is a hoot. This eighth film might have been more successful at the box office, if the movie was re-titled Jason Takes on a Cruise Ship. Which the director explained in the interview from the DVD extras that in his original script, the movie was supposed to take place 2/3 in New York City and then the last third in a Cruise Ship. The plot got flip over because of budget reasons.Because of that, the picture was mis-marketed and it was lowest grosses of the series for Paramount. The film is quite long, heavy handed at times and it has an unsatisfying conclusion that nearly knocks it down but the movie is pretty good, visually clever at times and it has amusing sense of humour. Die Hard fans of the series won't probably enjoy this one but director Hedden did the best he could with this one and brings the best performances from his cast. Which makes this most well acted in the series. Watch for an young Kelly Hu (Best known for The Scorpian King and X-Men 2 as Yuriko Oyama/Deathstrike) as one of Jason's victims. Canadian StuntmanKen Kirzinger appears in a cameo in the diner scene. Which Kirzinger went on to play Jason Voorhees in the already camp classic hit Freddy Vs. Jason. (***/*****).

This is a film that should mostly be watched for it's camp value much as you would watch any Ed Wood movie or Snakes on a Plane. This movie has no real value in it's characters, it is just one 98 minute gag. I love the movie for trying to do something different as I know by 1989 the old Jason in the woods scenario had been played out. But what follow up directors of this series have neglected to understand is that it has now been almost twenty years since Jason stalked the woods of Crystal Lake. He's been on vacation since 1989. He went to Hell in 93, Space in 02, and Elm Street in 03. Let's bring him him back to the camp, he needs it, he belongs there. I'm not talking about a remake like the evil Michael Bay wishes to push on us but a new entry in the saga that could end where Freddy vs Jason left off and bridge the gap to Jason X. Give us this film and let Michael Bay go as he does not know what the fans want but only what the stupid jocks and cheerleaders want along with the rap crowd. While that was a little off topic I had to say it as the down fall of Jason began with this film. If Jason Goes to Hell had done better and had more continuity with the Jason story line than the series would most likely be reaching it's twentieth film and not it's 12th. Friday The 13th Part VIII Jason Takes Manhatten is a fine film but it should have been a one off and then went back to the Masked One being violent and scary again as he was in the first four films and part seven.

In some ways, this movie is actually more creative than the previous sequels. In other ways, the movie misses out on many things.In this movie, Jason Voorhees is shocked back to life and climbs aboard a cruise ship filled with college students. The ship is heading for New York City, and Jason starts killing most of the people on board. Then later on, some remaining people survive and arrive at New York, with Jason following them...I must say that I love the very beginning of this movie. There are nice shots of New York City at night, as well as a great 80's song to begin the movie. However, the film doesn't really begin in New York; the scene shifts away to Camp Crystal Lake, where Jason is about to be resurrected by an electric shock from an underwater electric cable.Later on, the film introduces us to the characters that will board a ship, which Jason climbs aboard as the ship leaves for New York. Most of the film's run time is spent on the ship to explore the characters, while Jason hunts many of them down and starts killing them.The problem with this time spent on the ship is that it can get pretty boring just seeing the characters do dumb things. Thankfully, Jason kills them off quite well, although in not as good a fashion as in the previous sequels. There was just too much time spent on the ship and on useless characters.Another problem is the portrayal of New York City, when the few survivors (and Jason) finally get there. New York is a really dangerous place in the movie, with drug dealers and dirty barrels of toxic chemicals everywhere on the docking bays. I have never been in New York, but I'm sure the docks weren't that bad. I guess the film-makers had to make the docking bays look horrible so that the movie can remain a horror film.There are some good points, though. The idea of Jason being in a big city is fascinating, since Jason can finally get a taste of city life, rather than the usual forests on the outskirts of New Jersey (namely at Camp Crystal Lake). Also, the film seems to have borrowed elements from the Nightmare on Elm Street films The lead female character actually daydreams about a younger Jason in various parts of the movie.Overall, the best part of the movie is when the action happens in New York City. It's really interesting to see Jason stalking his victims in the Big Apple. If you're a fan of the Friday the 13th movies, then you might like this movie. However, don't expect it to be better than the sequels; it's just more creative than the sequels. Fast-forward to the last 30 minutes, when Jason & his victims are in New York City.I give this movie a 6/10.

All this amounts to the second worst Friday installment (nothing can top the 5th entry).The loopholes here are major league, even by Friday standards. Jason gets from one place to the other at lightning pace and that's just irritating as hell. Some technique director Hedden was trying out, even comparing this film in some places to the work of Hitchcock! To me, it's just irritating. Yes, some people have made a big deal out of it's visual style, but the fourth entry has a lot more style than here. Hedden also makes silly changes in the legacy of Jason and the ending totally blows everything, the worst ending possible to tack onto this film.The characters are uninteresting to say the least. The film's leading lady is intolerable and her uncle (one-dimesional anyone!) is pretty tough to take. Some of her actions are so far out there (like sitting down, taking a breather and feeling sorry for her abuse since childhood while Jason is just around the corner) that I was nearly in tears. Ahhhh, there's so much incredibly stupid things to point out here that I can't even recommend this film to fans of the series. The others are sometimes stupid but none compare to this.On the plus side; it's quite funny at times, with some clever dialogue and a few chuckles when Jason finally arrives in Manhattan. It was the most expensive Friday up to that point and it shows, every technical aspect well handled.In short; Not recommended.

As Jim and Suzy make love, Jason boards the boat and kills the two teenagers.The graduating class of Lakeview High boards the SS Lazarus, bound for New York City. Boarding the ship with her teacher Miss Van Deusen, Rennie Wickham is accosted by her uncle (and trip chaperon) Charles McCulloch. Despite his obvious displeasure at her attendance, she boards and meets up with her boyfriend Sean Robertson. Sean also has problems with his father, Admiral Robertson, the captain of the Lazarus. But their personal problems are about to become secondary to one big problem - Jim's boat drifts by and the Lazarus picks up an unwelcome stowaway...Soon JJ is killed by Jason when she goes below decks to jam on her guitar. Rennie is assailed by visions of a young Jason, and her dog Toby runs off. Elsewhere, Julius pummels a hapless opponent in a boxing match. Above, Tamara and Eva watch the match, and then head off (at Tamara's request) to do some cocaine. They are interrupted first by Rennie, then by her uncle. Jason kills Julius' opponent in the sauna while Tamara, afraid of being ratted out by Rennie, knocks her overboard. Rennie can't swim, and is first hit with visions of a young Jason as she flails in the water, and then again in the restroom after being rescued by Sean.After Tamara gets Wayne to tape McCulloch in a compromising position with her, she is stabbed with glass shards by Jason.

The others split up to look for help, and Jason kills the two thugs. Rennie escapes but Julius runs into Jason. After a valiant fight, Jason literally knocks Julius' block off, sending his head flying. The others find each one another, along with an cop who lets them into his cruiser. On the dash sits Julius' head, and the cop is dragged away by Jason. Rennie takes the wheel and slams the car into Jason. But when she tries to run down a vision of the young Jason, she rams into a wall. The car explodes, and Miss Van Deusen is killed.The trauma forces Rennie to remember her childhood, when her uncle took her out on Crystal Lake. He pushed her overboard to teach her how to swim, and she had a vision of Jason then. Sean and Rennie run off, leaving McCulloch to be killed by Jason.

Despite the films intentions, things didn't turn out good critically or financially. As everyone knows, the title for is somewhat misleading. While Jason does indeed appear in Manhattan, the film is close to being over & even then the endless possibilities of the things Jason could do is trashed by the simple fact that film hasn't got the budget to fulfil it's premise. Instead Hedden has his characters upon arrival, roaming down back alleys & subway systems & sewers looking for help (an odd place to look for an authority figure if you ask me). For many years, Friday fans consider PART 8 to be the weakest film in the franchise. Failing to deliver on what it's subtitle promised & the fact that the film, despite a small sprinkling of blood, fails to deliver on the gory thrills, however I honestly don't believe it was the directors fault. Several things were already up against the film right from the get go, like the actual cost of filming the majority of it in Manhattan became to much to spend on a Friday film (especially on a series that had dwindling box office returns since PART 5) & that forced the director to rework his original story. It's here though that I feel if we couldn't have Jason in Manhattan for the majority of the running time, that the title should have at least been changed to something else. Hedden's strength is in his writing & that's very evident here as the dialogue & characters are quiet good. Unlike the teens characters we seen in the Friday films before this, the teens all have personalities & back stories, not to mention goals & felt more real & while yes they may be the same type of characters cut from the same cloth (the nerd, the mean prom queen etc.) we actually care for these characters & Hedden has chosen an attractive & talented cast, as well as delivering excellent shots of New York and a much more polished look than the previous instalments. Another thing that runs through one's mind while they are watching the film is this, in previous entries, Jason always had a reason for killing his victims, here it makes no sense, why would Jason ditch Crystal Lake & head down the river to stalk kids on a boat bound for Manhatten? still I applaud Hedden for trying to do something different with this series & his directing is good. Another thing fans have kicked on is the films somewhat confusing ending, that sees Jason somehow transformed back into the 11 year old kid he was when he drowned on that terrible fateful day at Crystal Lake in 1957, in my eyes I don't believe Jason did, if you remember early in the film you'll see that Rennie kept having visions of Jason as a child many times before, both in his human & rotting forms, & what I think what director Hedden was trying to bring across is that Rennie saw that Jason was finally at rest, which is what the human 11 year old Jason symbolized, it was just another vision of Rennie's. As for the scenes where Jason can oddly teleport himself ahead of his intended victims, I never did understand fans complaints over this, Jason did the very same thing in Part 6 to some of his victims & nobody complained! If only Hedden had been able to get the budget to make his vision of the script come to life, box office failure or not, I can't help but think how the conversations & reviews of this film would have different. I mean can you imagine Jason stalking his victims through central park? killing somebody in or near the statue of liberty? fighting Julias one of his many victims inside Madison Square Garden? tearing up Broadway? or terrorizing The Rockettes? fighting or killing hookers & pimps? the possibilities are endless! & sadly we'll never know the alternate reality of what a real JASON TAKES MANHATTAN could have been. In terms of time line, the film although appears to be set in 1989, contradicts the time lines set in previous sequels & as a result of budget constraints, the film set almost entirely on a boat, is really the same old, same old, we seen in the previous seven instalments & fans looking for several shots of New York will be disappointed to learn that the film spends most of it's time in subways, alleyways & sewer systems & is actually Vancouver & what's up with the large boat to accompany just a handful of graduates? (The majority of whom disappear, never to be seen or heard from again as the film goes on) All in all, though I still recommend you see the film, my advice be that you push the somewhat misleading subtitle out of your mind & give the film a chance. Director Hedden manages a few funny moments most notably when Jason gets hassled by a street gang, that he scares off by showing them his face & another where the kids run into the diner & say that a maniac is trying to kill them, to which the waitress replies, Welcome to New York! as if Jason is just another maniac the city has to deal with, no biggie!

Yes, it is more ridiculous than a zombie killing machine fighting Freddy Kreuger, a creature of dreams (zombies dream?). Yes, it is even more ridiculous than the Mr. Smith Goes to Washington crossover that is in the works, where Jason kills Congress (this is really in the works) (not really).That said, this is a stupid movie. Jason is awakened from his death in Part VII (he was at the bottom of Crystal Lake) by a lightning bolt. Apparently, Jason just needed a jump start. As usual, Jason decides to kill the naughty teens of the Crystal Lake area. However, this time, the kids are taking a senior cruise. On Crystal Lake. To New York City. They went from a lake to New York City by boat. Of course, Jason starts killing people well before they land in New York, and the kids are forced into lifeboats that drift toward the city in a way that allows them to pass the Statue of Liberty. So, I guess the geography lesson we learn in this movie is that Crystal Lake is located in the Atlantic Ocean, because they certainly came to New York from the East.Another interesting tidbit we learn in this film is that Jason doesn't hate people or teens...he hates CRYSTAL LAKE people and teens. When Jason comes to New York, he doesn't just start a killing rampage, he tracks down the six people from his home town and proceeds to kill their faces off. What does this teach us about Jason? Obviously, he spends his time between murder rampages being a private investigator. He was able to find six people in New York City in one night with absolutely no problem. I would like to see this idea made into a movie. It would be like a cross between Shaft, Shaft in Africa, and Shaft is an Unkillable Zombie (Sucka!).Another fascinating part of this movie is the fact that Jason develops the ability to teleport. Well, there is no attempt to explain how he moves faster that some of his victims, so I suppose it's closer to Droopy-portation. You know how...you can run to the top of a mountain, lock yourself in a safe, and Droopy (you know, the cartoon dog) will still be right behind you. Jason takes a page from Droopy's book in this film. A kid might be climbling up a ladder with Jason on the ground below him, but through the magic of Droopy-portation, Jason appears on the top of the ladder, ready to kill.For added fun, try to identify the city this movie takes place in. It is clearly not New York. My best guess is Detroit, although it could have been filmed in a garage, too.

Most fans disliked it, partly due to its new settings, but I found it a refreshing, long-overdue change of pace. After the six previous sequels, I was getting tired of that same old summer camp, and I suspect even Jason might have felt that way by this point. It's an entertaining movie if not taken too seriously, especially the final act, where he chases potential victims all over the back alleys of New York City. The sewer finale is what a Jason movie is like at its cheesy best; pretty goofy if held up to the light of day, but fun to watch if you're in the right mood.Actually, its subtitle is a bit misleading. Much of the film takes place aboard a small cruise ship filled with students. That makes things a bit more interesting, due to their isolation in a confined space; it's not like they can just get up and run off. Perhaps it's too convenient that the bodies remain undiscovered for so long, but logic was never a priority in most slasher movies. Another point of consternation among fans was Jason's new teleporting ability, but that didn't bother me too much. If he truly has a supernatural hellspawn living within him, as the next film would reveal, it only stands to reason that he has other supernatural aspects that have not yet been touched upon. The bizarre subplot about the heroine's telepathic powers (shades of Friday 7) are not adequately explained, but exposition never fit comfortably in the series. If it makes things more interesting, why not include it? All in good fun.On a technical level, this is arguably the most polished film in the series (with the possible exception of Jason X). More effort than usual was put into the lighting, and the camerawork is smooth and assured. Most of the time, it doesn't even look like a slasher movie. Though most of the Manhattan scenes were actually filmed in Canada, director Rob Hedden manages to preserve the illusion by a couple of brief, carefully inserted Times Square scenes. The acting is much better than usual for this type of film, especially a strong supporting performance from Peter Mark Richman as a coldhearted, overprotective uncle. Jensen Dagget is likable as the troubled heroine; overall the performances are credible, if not outstanding. At the very least, the characters are not nearly as obnoxious as they were in previous outings. Even the obligatory slut character is somewhat more tolerable than usual. The most ironic part is that the Big Apple is portrayed in such a nasty light that Jason himself doesn't seem too bad in comparison. Kane Hodder still makes him a compelling killer though.

Meanwhile the electricity line underneath the water connects with the boat anchor, and they both touch the slain body of Jason Voorhees and he soon comes back to life. He climbs aboard the boat, adournes a new hockey mask and kills the teens.        The vessel bound for New York get's loaded up the next day. A young girl, Rennie, arrives with her teacher and her dog, Toby.Her uncle the principal, a mean old grouch named Charles McCulloch, isthere too. He's always being bossy and ordering people about. He alsothinks the legend of Jason Voorhees is a load of malarchy. The teensinclude a mean girl named Tamera, Dwayne-a geek with a camcorder,Julius-a cool boxer, and Sean-the son of the captain. Sean takes aliking to Rennie, even gives her a Statue of Liberty necklace. Butthere's a stowaway on board Jason Voorhees. So this gradulation trip toNew York becomes the ultimate voyage of the damned. Jason murders everyteen he can get his hands on. Soon, the ship runs into a terrible storm. The surviving kids, Rennie, Sean, Julius, Mrs. Menduzan, and Charles McCulloch climb aboard a life raft and soon arrive in New York. They're first caught in a fog and McCulloch offers his criticism and really doesn't help at all! They dock in New York in aplace that McCulloch calls sarcastically, a fine place. They meet up with pick pockets, who kidnap Rennie. But soon after, Jason arrives in New York!! For once, Jason actually saves a life rather than takesit. When the pickpockets force Rennie to take heroine and attempt to rape her, Jason kills them. Hooray for Jason! Rennie escapes and meets back up with Sean, Mrs. Menduzan and McCulloch. Julius had a run-in with Jason and began to box him, but when Jason took his shot, he took Julius' head right off! Now poor Mrs. Menduzan is killed in a caraccident that has flaming results! Someone else did Jason's job! In the fire, Rennie saw a vision of when she was a little girl and her uncle Charles took her to Crystal Lake and scared her by telling her fables of Jason at the bottom of the lake that pulls down kids who can't swim. So it was because of him that she's terrified andhallucinates about Jason. So Sean and Rennie leave McCulloch...At the mercy of Jason! Good old Jason grabs McCulloch and drowns him in arat tank. Once again, Jason kills someone who deserves it. He's killed people in the past who have deserved it, but McCulloch really deserved it! Jason then chases Rennie and Sean downtown. In the subway, in a restaurant, even meets up with punks who are scared stiff at what Jason shows them underneath his mask.         Rennie and Sean hide in the sewer and dice him with toxic waste. Then the sewer floods with it and when it clears, all that's left of Jason is a little boy. Rennie and Sean, and now Toby, are left together in the big good old New York city!         This film was good. Original. But I hated Charles McCulloch and Tamera. What's good about horror movies is that if there's a jerky character, he or she will be killed, but not in any other movie. Not a comedy anyway. So if you saw the first seven parts, see this one too! It's followed by JASON GOES TO HELL THE FINAL FRIDAY, but we all know it wasn't, for JASON X is coming out next year.

The film's duration time was 96 minutes and when I was watching it, it seemed to go on for much longer it seemed like it was sitting there for 3 to 4 hours. It dragged too much.

The protagonists are pretty standard, I don't really like or dislike them. The character of Tamara is pretty much exactly the same as Melissa from Part VII, and the deckhand character is the same type of doom prophet like Ralph from the first two films or that guy with the eyeball in Part III.Once the protagonists and Jason get to New York City, it gets really great, and more time in the film is actually spent there than some people's complaints would lead you to believe.

Director Rob Hedden manages to write a fairly imaginative story here with the beautiful Jensen Dagget as heroine Rennie, dealing with her latent psychic powers, as it seems that fate has decreed she will be the one to break the curse of Jason, destroying his body and freeing his soul once and for all, which was the intent of the thoughtful ending.Of course, this is still a routine killing picture, with the expected violence(though not as graphic as usual) and supporting characters quite similar to Part VII, and this film does not stray that far from formula, but it is IMO the best of the sequels(not the popular view I know!)which at least attempts something different, and brings the series to a fitting end...well, at least as Paramount is concerned, though sadly another studio would get its hands on this franchise, in a series of films I choose to ignore!

We start out all right (once we get past the opening credits and the annoying music), with a couple of kids on a yacht having sex. The boat anchor gets snagged on an underwater power line and pulls it into Jason's submerged corpse. Yadda yadda yadda, the kids wind up dead. Pretty good up to this point, but then we start meeting the kids that are going on their senior trip - a cruise to New York. For some reason the director decided to make the rest of the movie with a very morose attitude. The characters act gloomy, dismal, the whole atmosphere is one of sorrowful bleakness. The movie grinds to an immediate halt as soon as the lead female pulls up in a car and we discover that we're no longer watching a Friday the 13th movie, we've stumbled across a Lifetime Movie of the Week! Our lead character is deeply troubled because of something bad that happened to her in the past. She spends every waking moment filled with anxiety and hopelessness. She goes through an entire Lifetime Movie of the Week story arc, eventually facing her fears and overcoming them! Oh, for pete's sake. This boring melodramatic crap drags the whole thing to a standstill, while every time Jason shows up for a quick kill, the movie lurches back into gear. Then it stops, then it lurches. Repeat throughout movie.It doesn't help that among the adult characters, the female has absolutely no personality whatsoever, and the male is a jerk with a capital J, E, R, and K. That guy gets unbearable after a while.Oh, but wait, here's a cool rock 'n' roll chick! Maybe this movie will be fun after all! No, 60 seconds later she's dead. Then there's the prom queen, a nasty little tart who provides what little entertainment there is in the movie. She has one scene where she seduces the teacher. It's fairly indicative of what's screwed up about the rest of the movie, so let me tell you about it. For one thing, the teacher is a JERK (as previously mentioned). For another thing, he's bugging her to hand in her biology project. Like, who the heck turns in homework in the middle of a senior trip? Then miss prom queen strips to her undies, which you might think would be nice, but she's got this stupid stuff drawn all over herself - pictures of her organs. She's her own biology project, get it? It's dumb, it's distracting, and it's completely unnecessary considering she's only trying to get pictures of the teacher in a compromising position with her. And just to really cap it all off, the teacher does a horrible job of acting during the scene. In other words, this scene is a microcosm of all the errors committed in the rest of the film.Anyhow, Jason kills most everybody in very boring fashion. With so few people on the boat, why does it seem to take so long for everyone to die? Well, because there's absolutely no suspense; somebody is walking somewhere, you know perfectly well what happens next, Jason all of a sudden appears and instantly kills them. No suspense, no scares, just boring redundancy. The survivors paddle a rowboat to Manhattan, everything is filthy, there's a stupid ending, and then you're done. One funny part is when Jason punches a guy and knocks his head clean off.Overall, I'd recommend watching parts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 10 instead of wasting your time with this one. It's not fun, it's not scary, it actually is fairly boring. There's not even a decent amount of T&A, not that it would help. And that's gotta be one incredibly bad slasher if T&A wouldn't have even helped.The bottom line is that the folks who made this committed the biggest mistake you can make in B movie making They didn't have the talent to make a good movie, but they didn't have the humility to make an enjoyable bad one.

The title of this movie is so misleading that it may make you upset if you were hoping to see Jason taking hostages and making all sorts of demands that could never possibly be honored. No, this movie is primo garbage in a bevy of different ways, not the least of which is the almost complete absence of gore. Apparently they cut it all out. Not that it would have helped the movie much but it would've been a more involving experience. There are one or two creative deaths, the take your best shot scene being the most memorable. Chances are, anyone who's seen this funky sock of a movie will remember that scene as well.The one thing you will hear the most about the movie is that about three quarters of it takes place on a boat. What?, you say. Believe me when I tell you that this is indeed a sad yet true fact. Most of the people that die get it on the boat. I don't remember the details but somehow the boat gets messed up pretty bad and the survivors escape and float over to Manhattan, where they are immediately greeted by the best that the city has to offer, i.e. drug dealers, bums, street gangs, etc. Jason mangles a few people and it's edited down to a watery flavor whenever it happens. There's one part that will probably make you laugh and it's when Jason, about to skewer our heroes on a train that is unlike any Manhattan train I have ever ridden in my twenty eight years (and believe me, I've ridden them all), loses his balance when one of the kids pulls the emergency brake and slides across the entire car on his back. And then he gets up and does everything short of ask the passengers in the crowded car if they saw him bust his ass. It is the best thing about this movie. Sigh.Anyway, I think my biggest gripe with this flick is that they manage to make Manhattan look like more of a cesspool than it actually is. There's a scene where two people running from Jason on Times Square (!) turn a corner and END UP IN A DEAD END ALLEY. From Times Square! What the hell is that all about? Anyway, I'm gonna stop here.

Jason is not supposed to be in the city, he is not scary there.  He is supposed to be in the woods away from civilization where he can terrorize unsuspecting kids in the forest or at a cottage.  By putting him in the city it takes away the element of fear but more than that, it makes you question how any of these people could die.  Hello, New York is one of the biggest cities in the world, how hard can it be to get away?  Could you imagine Indiana Jones in the same world that The Matrix took place in?  Kind of hard isn't it?    There is no suspence, no terror, no wondering or caring about who is going to live.  There is just idiocy.  And I know the Friday's are famous for their lack of continuity but please, how could that girl have possibly been attacked by Jason when she was a kid?

Also the first 'Friday' film to have comedy override the suspense. Some bad special effects such for lame kills and the worst Jason face in the series combined with poor acting and film decisions makes this installment edge out part five as the worst in the series to date.

Whenever Rennie sees him, however, he suddenly looks like he has down syndrome and like somebody beat him with a 2x4 made from every ugly branch they could get a hold of. On top of that, he pretty much has a different appearance every time Rennie sees him. Then there's the whole Crystal Lake leading into the ocean thing and the ending. Heavens, the ending is just a cluster of retardism. The script isn't so hot either. Julius is probably the best example. After Wayne asks him what weapon he's going to take after they realize Jason is on the ship, Julius replies, Nothing, then pauses for a moment before following with, ...but this gun. The kills were also lacking. Jason takes a guitar to a girl's head and throws a guy onto an antenna. That's about as inventive as we get this time around.

In this one Jason kills a lot of kids plus the ships Captain then leaves the ship, which is sinking, to Manhatten to kill some more people. Manhatten in this film seemed strangely empty of people except what was left from the ship...In any case avoid if you can.

With that kind of foresight this deckhand could have had a better career on stage and late night talk shows. Also before launching off they are warned of a coming storm coming their way soon.In this episode Jason is not happy with slaying his usual Crystal Lake residents but migrates down river and boards ship by scaling up the anchor.Doesn't take long before Jason trims down his cast mates, in a contrived twist of events Rennie conveniently is psychically linked to the young boy Jason Voorhees begins suffering visions of the boy drowning or pleading for his life.When Sean's father the captain of the vessel is discovered dead, the students begin to buy into this Jason crap but the professor Charles suspects it's that crazy loony deckhand (honestly I would have made the same deduction but oh well). Everybody arms themselves and choose to divide and conquer hunting Jason down to kill him before he kills them never mind he is a walking zombie corpse.This choices only seems to hurt their chances of survival and during the course of this action more bodies pile up and Jason even succeeds in destroying the engines. Soon the ship is taking water and the survivors board a life boat and escape.Luck is on their side, they dock at a New York harbor, begin discussing their next set of actions when they held up by some lowlife crooks who abduct Rennie. The gang flees the scene to find help and meanwhile Jason emerges out of the bay onto the dock (either he is an incredible fast swimmer with an on-board GPS device or he teleported?).In his pursuit of the gang, he does something heroic for once and kills the pair of crooks that were going to rape Rennie.Once again our intrepid gang decides to divide their efforts to find the cops.In this movie New York is about seven city blocks large because everyone has no difficulty finding each other through the labyrinthine alleys and streets of New York neither does the instantaneous teleporting Jason. Yet they can't find a single damn cop anywhere. And Jason has to be the stupidest one of all, he can kill the whole city of New York but chooses to chase our gang of grad students and teachers (maybe it's his on-board GPS device?).With the students dwindling, Rennie has sudden recollections of her uncle Charles cruelly using Crystal Lake and the tale of Jason as a motivational tool to help Rennie learn to swim as he is one of those stern figures that encourages success and achieving important goals. Rennie believes she seen Jason while she was drowning under the watchful eye of Charles and that the boy had tried to pull her under. Here is our link! Eventually it's just Sean and Rennie with Jason close behind in pursuit after a couple of near misses and dead ends they find themselves in the sewer with 10 minutes left before its flooded with toxic waste. The end is predictable.I have rated F13 Parts VI-VIII incredibly low I find nothing respectable about these films, they are strictly catering to the popularity of Jason Voorhees and these films were for the fanbois to set their panties in a hanker.1/10 "},{"Title":"it's funny but no Kubrick please","Date":"20 April 2009","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":" yes, I would have said this was the best part of the whole Friday the 13th series, but the strange ending messed up my positive ideas about it. so it's weird, that's nice. it's a bit incestuous (with that uncle), it's got heroes we already know and the best of all Jason is so cool! really, in this episode, Jason steals the show. he's funny (the gang in New York sees his face and they run away scared as hell), he's intelligent (he doesn't kill everyone he sees), he's a menace (he destroys a lot more than in the other pictures of the Friday series), he's a monster (creepy effects), but...

Then they also put some new stuff the new scenarios (ship and New York). I guess it was something nice to be different, unlike the Part VII when they tried to innovate with the paranormal phenomena, and I found it really absurd and out of context to a JASON flick. Unlike the title might induce the major part of the plot is not passed in New York but inside the ship which was traveling to there. So JASON just took a lift to travel a little bit!) I think this film is more suspenseful than other titles in the series and it fits in a type of horror movie which has more to do with the 90's and recent horror films that to the 80's flicks. It's clich√©d of course, but with the clich√©s of the 90's and not so much of the 80's, like the previous films. Besides, it also has a subtle but effective humor (like that scene where JASON takes his mask and show his face to some New York street kids, or the other one when a guy says give me your best shot, and JASON rip off his head...), unlike the Part VI, where it was totally forced and unfunny.

We've already learned in previous installments that Jason is an unstoppable and un-killable monster with enormous strength. But wait, 'VIII' now shows us he can teleport as well! No wonder while all his victims run fast, he can always catch up with them without much effort. In a lot of the scenes on the ship and a few in Vancouver, Canada (Oh, sorry, they're saying it's Manhattan, USA my bad,) he seems to just disappear and reappear right in front of the soulless characters. Despite a few unique kills (true meaning to knocking one's block off and vanity kills,) most are just stale or just simply odd &#150; toxic waste is just left in barrels in alleys? And speaking of which, I have wondered why we never see Jason eat, but 'VIII' seems to show a Freddy Krueger side &#150; when he kills, that seems to be soul-capturing, or nourishment to him, I suppose. Again, in this 'Friday' installment are the usual suspects scenes that don't make sense (an anchored ship drifts off (??) with Jason on board, and he doesn't seem to want to get off, despite he was at his home where he always tried to get to), sex and dumb characters with dumb ideas. However, there were a few highlights the soundtrack was pretty good (for the time,) the billboard scene was hilarious and the getting him out of the woods for once and into the city was interesting. Again, unfortunately, only expect that for about a half hour of the film, just like 'Jurassic Park 2's dinos in San Diego.

To be honest I don't think any of the Friday The 13th films are bad I found them all great. Being the huge Jason fan for as long as I remember I really enjoyed Jason killing off teens on a cruise ship a little different, as you don't see many slasher movies set on cruise ships.Although there were a few things I was disappointed with in this film, some of the deaths weren't shown and others weren't that good This sequel also slaps in new gimmicks and they don't really work. I'll start off with the teleportation vibe. What was up with that? This entry has Jason being able to materialise anywhere he wants, which is just stupid and the back story involving the main heroine and Jason was just pointless.Jensen Dagget (Rennie) is good at playing the female lead and plus she's stunning, Peter Mark Richman (Charles) excels at playing the cruel headmaster/Rennie's uncle you just love to hate him, Scott Reeves (Sean) is good and easy on the eye as the good hearted hunk, VC Dupree (Julius) is amusing as the tough guy, I enjoyed the scene where he keeps punching Jason then Jason takes his head of literally, Barbara Bingham played the kind hearted teacher Miss Colleen Van Deusen well very likable but ends with tragic results Sharlene Martin (Tamara) plays the one-dimensional slut to perfection.

I wasn't to familiar with the Jason flicks other then seeing part 1, 2 and part 6, but this one looked really interesting to me at the time. Mainly, because Jason is suppose to take Manhatten. The whole thought of it seemed like a lot of fun and was a good time to take advantage of the body count. Of course, as all of us Jason fans know, this movie was a big let down. Jason is in New York for the last 30 minutes of the movie and certainly doesn't take Manhattan.For those of you that don't know the storyline on how the heck Jason even gets to Manhattan, here it is. There is a High School trip on a cruise boat heading out towards New York. Jason, still underwater from the last film, awakens once again and boards the ship. Of course, he starts killing off the High Schoolers one by one in various different methods. About an hour into the film the remaining people on board decide to ditch the boat and head for shore on a row boat. And were do they end up? In Manhattan of course! Some how, Jason has followed them to Manhattan (I just can't see Jason swimming) and starts stalking them on the streets and alleys of New York.This really could have been a fun film, with the whole change in atmosphere and what not. There are a lot of problems with the film, though. Of course, what I stated above in my first paragraph about Jason only being in the City for about 30 minutes. This didn't really give Jason enough time to go on any real rampage. Sure, he kills some dead beat heroin addicts and and a few other people, but I wanted to see Jason really tear up New York and make them remember the name Jason Voorhies. Instead, he just decides to terrorize the last remaining people from the ship.Also, the music for the movie was pretty bad at times dating the movie. The nice thing about the other Jason flicks is a great and unforgettable soundtrack. What we get here is a lot of hair rock. But, they may have done this trying to change the format. It just doesn't work, though. Instead, it adds an extra bit of humor to this already silly film.I think with this movie it is important not to try and take it so seriously. Yes, this is a poor excuse for a Jason flick, but, it certainly is a laugh riot at times. And I think that is what you have to do. Ignore the fact that Jason can magically teleport about and laugh about it instead. Laugh at how silly Kane Hodder looks with his heavy breathing. And laugh at the death scenes, as they are quite funny even if they aren't all that bloody. And finally, laugh at how stupid Jason looks without his mask on.I have to defend this movie as a horror fan and as a Friday the 13th fan. Certainly, it is not a good movie, but it is still a lot of fun. 7/10 "},{"Title":"Jason's Night On The Town.","Date":"15 August 2006","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":" Friday the 13th Part VIII - Jason Takes Manhattan is the eighth (yes, eighth) sequel in the series. The film opens with a couple of young adults on a boat on Camp Crystal Lake. The boyfriend, with intent on scaring his girlfriend, begins to tell her the story of Jason Voorhees, who is now somewhere below the waters of the lake, chained down after Tina Shepard sent him there in Part VII. Well, with a lightning strike, Jason is revived, and of course, slaughters the couple on the boat. From there, we are introduced to a girl named Rennie, an aspiring writer who is boarding a small cruise ship with her graduating class for a fun night in New York City. But little do they know, Jason is onboard also, and he begins killing the kids off one by one. A very small group of teens, including Rennie and her boyfriend, escape the ship at the NY dock, with Jason hot on their trail. It's Jason's night on the town, and he reprises his reign of terror on the city.It was different to see Jason in such a different setting here, all of the other films featured him stalking innocent (and not so innocent) teens in the woods around Crystal Lake, so the change of scenery was a bit refreshing. Kane Hodder returns to play Jason, I think he's the best, most convincing actor to take the job of playing such a maniac. It's good fun to watch him stalk the teenagers in alleyways, streets, and the underground tunnels below New York. It isn't until the 40-45 minute point when Jason and the teens actually arrive at the city, but the rest from there was complete fun. Jason actually does good in this film too, unintentionally saving Rennie from two inner-city guys who are about to rape her. Of course, they get theirs from Jason. Speaking of deaths, the body count in this film is quite large, possible one of the largest counts of the series. Well, maybe. The deaths are gory and gruesome, plenty to please the hardcore gorehounds. The acting was so-so, but one doesn't expect much from a Friday sequel.Overall, Part VIII Jason Takes Manhattan is semi-brainless fun. It's a nice change of scenery to see Jason do his thing in the inner-city, and I'm sure all of the hardcore fans of the series will enjoy watching it all happen. Entertaining and fun all around. 6/10.

Jason Takes Manahattan is one of my favorite sequels of the series and I find it strange that there are so many negative reviews from fans for this installment. Aside from the weird ending, part 8 actually treads new ground successfully(in my opinion) and definitely delivers it very entertainingly. This is one of the only sequels in which we know other things about the characters than just their names. For example we have the main character Rennie who has a mysterious secret throughout the film that she is terrified of the water because when she was a little girl Jason tried to pull her down under the water while she was drowning we also have Wayne the aspiring film student and Tamara the beauty prom-queen type and Sean the guy who doesn't want to follow in his fathers footsteps. All in all it just seems as if the script cared a little bit more for its characters unlike some of the previous films. Not too much more, but enough to elevate the story above average.I hear a lot of people complain that too much of this movie takes place aboard the cruise ship. And this is true and sort of misleading because the title states that Jason takes Manhattan when in reality he just goes there and kills the rest of the survivors from the cruise ship. This DID disappoint me at first but I got over it. I like this movie. The soundtrack and songs are great, it has a good opening, and all the characters are pretty likable(except for Rennie's Uncle and Tamara). There are also a few worth mentioning death scenes in this installment which is an improvement over Part 7's excruciatingly censored farce. First off there is the fairly violent strangulation scene on the dance floor of one of the would-be grads. Then there is the scene in the boats basement involving a guitar which I think is pretty awesome. And last we have the boxing scene in NYC between Julius and Jason himself which is classic stuff.The NY scenes(the last quarter of the film)were all well executed and definitely worth the wait. I like the scene where Rennie and Sean are pleading for the waitress to call the police claiming that a maniac is trying to kill them and she replies welcome to New York just as Jason busts through the front doors. Yeah, this ain't nothing from New York honey!! The finale in the sewers is great. Jason's execution in this one started out just fine/Rennie throws a drum full of toxic waste straight into his eyes, blinding him, and he ultimately drowns again after the sewer floods out. All this would have been a nice end to a fun and energetic sequel until they show the shot of him reborn as a little boy. What?? It makes no sense at all. They should have skipped that and had the last shot be the one of his acid-melted mask floating by. That would have been great. But hey, its all good. 8/10 is my vote. One of my personal faves!!

It would not be the last, the best or the worst. Jason Goes to Hell was the worst, Freddy Versus Jason the best. This film is also the last go around from Paramount which sold its rights to New Line, not sure why. This film cost the company only five million and grossed 15, so while not a super hit, it made money. It is the last film in the series to really try to follow the story set in the previous film too, as New Line completely ignores the ending here and completely made a crazy film that was more science fiction than slasher. So for me, this film was not exactly good, but I always thought part six was actually the most entertaining and the films declined until Freddy Versus Jason livened things up again.The story here has Jason being shocked back alive again after being left dead in the lake again. Seriously, he is like the Hensei version of Godzilla, where if he is put in the water he stays harmless until provoked again. Well he gets a new mask, kills a couple of idiots and then makes his way onto another boat full of dumb graduate teens that is heading for New York! Though one has to wonder how that is possible as I always imagined Camp Crystal Lake being landlocked and nowhere near the Atlantic Ocean. Well, whatever, I can roll with it. Well you keep waiting for them to get to New York and for Jason to take Manhattan, but for the most part the film is set on the boat. Maybe 15 or so minutes are actually in the Big Apple. If the film had been titled Jason Takes a Boat to Manhattan, people would not be quite as upset with the film. A couple of stupid plot points involving the main girl and her previous encounters at the lake add nothing and the ending is kind of ridiculous. Gunshots do not harm him, electricity revives him and toxic waste apparently turns him back to a child...what? The film is not boring and for that I give it a few more stars than it probably deserves. Honestly, the coolest part of the film is that rather good song they sing at the beginning and end as it is the best song in the series after Alice Cooper's Man Behind the Mask. You have your kills and you have your nudity and for maybe a bit of the movie you have the location promised.

OK, so it's false advertising to a degree.  We see a great opening shot of Manhattan, and we don't see Manhattan again until the final 30 minutes.  And other than the Times Square footage (which you can't fake), it was all shot in Canada!  And probably any real New Yorker (like myself) can tell the difference.  But who cares?  That's not the issue!  You think the director of a Friday movie is gonna be meticulous about detail?  Get the hell out of here! The point is it's a fun movie with cool death scenes (i.e.  the fighter getting his head literally knocked off by Jason's powerful punch), characters you can give a damn about, actors who are moderately good and even some moments of humor.  There was no gratuitous nudity, but I was having so much fun that I really didn't care.  I gotta say, the methods of bringing Jason get back become more pathetic by the sequel (Jason Goes to Hell is the most prime example), but once you get over that, you should have tons of fun.  It definitely has its memorable moments, like when a group of thugs plan to attack Jason.  Once Jason lifts his mask (and it's made funnier since we don't see Jason's face and instead we're fixated on the thugs' reactions), the thugs quickly run off.  Hell, it's convincing to have someone like Jason roaming the streets of Manhattan and have no one give a damn.  In Manhattan, you got much more deadly people than Jason roaming around, who look weirder than a tall guy in a hockey mask.  Psycho in hockey mask walking the streets of Times Square?  What else is new?  Die-hard fans of the Jason series may find a boatload of flaws with this eighth installment (I once heard someone complain that one of the actors who played Jason didn't show enough expression--WHAT FREAKING EXPRESSION???), but anyone who's simply a fan of good B-horror should appreciate the film.

This movie also has good flashbacks, they bring you up to speed if you havent seen all 7 previous Jason movies and establish a supernatural presence at once. This Jason also has the regular Jason/Michael Myers basic elements, taking shots from a wide variety of firearms, explosions, rudimentary teleportation, stabbings, drownings and futile pleas for mercy. However F13#8 has endearing qualities unlike any of the other Jason films, the almost funny scene when he stands next to the billboard with his exact likeness and when he disses the street gang and scares the hell out of them instead of killing them, showing that he takes priority over those who step near his lake.

Look I mean I was close on giving this a 4 though it picked up a little bit with these things Kane Hodder did a great job at being Jason Voorhees. He truly does a menacing, stunt like, risk taking monster.In this film there is intense music and the theme Darkest Side Of The Night is enjoyable to listen to.The Kills like any Friday the 13th are awesome and fun to watch.The Story line is OK though it could of being more high up like the other Friday the 13th. The other Fridays had a creepy side and this one just doesn't come level and razor with it.Noiw I'm going to talk about the things that could of been improved on and the things that are an utter fail This film is too Predictable. Every time someone is somewhere, we just see Jason sneak on them. With the girl with the rockin guitar for an example, it was obvious that when she went down to the boiler room, Jason was going to go after her. There are many other scenes that do this and that's why I found this film predictable all the time. The Other Friday the 13ths where never predictable. It was a long wait and then Jason would just attack, but here all we have is Jason on a gory rampage.The film is also very unrealistic. I believe that this 13th film is shitty in the way it's trying to be realistic. In any Horror film, we see one Horror icon in the corner, and then seconds later, we'll see it behind a car or in front of a tree. But it only happened from time to time. Here it's a major problem. They keep up this thing that I've just talked about though they are making Jason move from one place to the other every 5 seconds and in different scenes, it just keeps happening. For example I found it stupid when the Asian woman was getting chased by Jason. Every corner she turned he was there. When she tried another corner, he was there quick before her, WTF!?, and then Jason chasing Remmie's uncle/principal. Jason was standing near a trash pile and the principal ran away, and into a building. As he gets in there Jason is already there and throws him out of a second story window. That's just stupid.There is also bad acting and some of the things that relate to this movie are weird.This film is also a blow up because it's not set at Crystal Lake, and it doesn't have that chilling, eerie feeling because it's not set at Crystal Lake.Anyway that it. I'm going to be fair because even if this film shits big time, there are small elements that make the film alright.

Until the series reboot in 2009, which set out to take the troubled franchise back to year zero, Jason films after this one would have stand-alone titles that ostensibly separated them from the Friday films. It's certainly telling that Part VIII is so stupid and insulting to F13 fans that no one wanted to officially follow it up for two decades.Director Rob Hedden is so clueless in his handling of the relatively simple Jason character that one suspects he either chose not to see any of the other films in the Friday series before setting out to make this piece of crap, or he simply thought that discarding every element that made even the most marginal sequels fun to watch would somehow strike filmatic gold. Jason's primary purpose throughout this series is to kill people off in gruesome ways, right? However, in this film, for every creative kill (such as the admittedly original sauna rock meets chest cavity gag), there is a rote piece of minor mayhem that would be more at home in a PG film. After watching Jason use cutlery and brute strength in fascinating ways for 7 films, seeing him limit himself to a strangulation and drowning here is quite a downer. Even the scene where Jason literally punches someone's head off, which should be cool since it has someone's head getting literally punched off, plays out with an air of idiocy on par with the rest of this wretched excursion.Aside from spitting in the face of Friday fans with the absence of gore and the borderline blasphemous change of scenery, the sheer absurdity and disregard of anything resembling coherence here is beyond anything we've previously seen in a series already well known for testing its audience's ability to suspend their disbelief. Our heroine Rennie is haunted throughout the film by the ghost of Jason as a boy (?!) for no apparent reason, which sets us up for a climax where Jason as we know him is caught in a flood of toxic waste that somehow transforms him from our lovable murderous behemoth (who, pathetically, looks and sounds like a stillborn Muppet when his mask comes off) into the sniveling little boy we see in Rennie's visions. To further make this bit of nonsense difficult to digest, young Jason appears throughout the film with almost zero facial deformity and a full head of hair, which, short of Rennie seeing a little girl instead, couldn't be more ignorant of the Jason mythos. But, wait, it gets better! In one of Rennie's visions, lil' Jason manifests as the bald and misshapen lad we're familiar with, only to magically grow his hair back and lose his disfigurements the next time we see him. Make up your mind, Rob...The tone of the film is particularly disjointed, utilizing almost no intentional humor yet reveling in the absurd with such abandon that we're almost certain by the end that Hedden was setting out to make a comedy. The fact that the film opens and closes with a badly aged 80's song that sounds more like a Miami Vice plot-summary montage tune certainly doesn't help matters either.Even the actors seem confused as they go through the motions. Consider the emotional apex late in the film when Rennie recounts the story of finding out her parents were killed in a car accident, to which her boyfriend replies, that's not going to happen this time. Good call, dude. It's good to reassure Rennie that being chased through the alleys of New York by Jason is not going to cause her parents to somehow come back to life and die in a car crash for a second time.While the film doesn't succeed as an effective Friday The 13th sequel, or even as a watchable movie, it does provide some truly fascinating little known facts about New York. For instance, did you know that in New York City, there are barrels of toxic waste just sitting around in alleyways? To be fair, this is one of the few points that is consistent with the film's concussed logic, since a sanitation worker tells us later that the sewers become flooded with toxic waste every night at midnight (??!!).We are also illuminated on a few fallacies that the series to this point had failed to illustrate. Like the fact that Crystal Lake isn't a lake at all, but is actually attached to the Atlantic Ocean, thus allowing Jason to cling to the departing cruise ship most of the film takes place on and set sail for New York. Thanks for filling us in, Rob Hedden! Still, you have to sympathize with hapless Rennie, who throughout the film endures the deaths of virtually everyone she knows, gets stalked by a merciless killer, nearly freezes in a life boat for hours, then gets mugged, kidnapped, shot up with heroin, and almost raped by two thugs IMMEDIATELY after finding the relative safety of New York. The poor gal certainly has a legitimate claim for worst day ever. Appearing in this steaming pile of pig-vomit certainly doesn't make things any better for her either.If all of this ranting makes this film sound like a so bad it's good contender, don't be misled. I cannot stress enough how awful this film is, or how ineptly the makers of this tripe handle material that should pretty much write itself. Jason Takes Manhattan is an abomination, and a definite contender for the Worst Film Of All Time Not Starring Rob Schneider trophy. Now THAT'S scary... "},{"Title":"Go Jason!

Unbeknownst to her and the rest of the passengers, Jason Voorhees, recently resurrected and VERY PO'd, has already boarded the ship and is looking for irresponsible teens to slaughter. Rennie, her boyfriend, her sadistic jerk of an uncle and a very small handful of survivors manage to escape the ship and dock in New York harbor before Jason can kill them too...but Jason is not so easily left behind. The huge and hulking hockey masked killer follows Rennie and her friends right into Times Square.This is yet another semi-brainless installment in the never ending teen slaughter-fest that is Friday the 13th, and yet I really enjoyed this 8th sequel. It's nice to see Jason taken out of Crystal Lake and transplanted elsewhere for a change. Kane Hodder is and remains my favorite incarnation of Jason Voorhees and his performance here is nothing short of amazing the man somehow manages to make Jason express explosive rage, childlike curiosity, impatience, disgust and even dry humor, all from behind an expressionless hockey mask. My favorite scenes are all of him Jason peering up at a billboard advertising a hockey team, Jason flipping his mask up and revealing his rotting visage to a group of punks, Jason knocking a guys head off, Jason throwing Ken Kirzinger (the future Mr. Voorhees) across a diner and into a mirror. Jason Voorhees has never been more frightening and cool than when played by Hodder, and watching Jason plow through back alleys, a subway train and the New York sewer system is exhilarating great fun! You'll be rooting for Jason in several scenes, such as when Jason unintentionally rescues Rennie from rape or slams the jerk of an uncle head first into a rain barrel.The body count is high and bloody, the teens one-dimensional and vacuous - the better to enjoy the slaughter - and the action unrelenting. And though it is true that Jason spends far more time on the cruise ship than in Manhattan itself, its a forgivable mishap. Once Jason enters Times Square you'll have forgotten about the ship anyway. Longtime hardcore fans of the series will probably enjoy this offering of cinematic junk food and appreciate it for what it is - harmless fun. 7 out of 10 stars for Jason takes Manhattan.

My appreciation has nothing to do with nostalgia since I didn't become a fan until I was well into adulthood when I saw 1985's Friday the 13th Part V A New Beginning on TV one night in the early 2000s. I think I like these movies because they typically involve young adults in a fun camp-type environment in the woods, which naturally stirs fond youthful memories (not that I'm that old); the presence of a lunatic unstoppable killer &#x97; who increasingly becomes an infernal monster &#x97; just adds an air of danger and suspense to the dramedy and adventure. Add scores of gorgeous females and various filming locations around North America and you have a fabulously entertaining franchise that has yet to end. It's the camp-like settings of most of the series and the unstoppable malevolent force that is Voorhees -- Jason, his mother, or anyone under his diabolic spell -- that especially sets Friday the 13th apart from similar franchises.The first two films are serious in nature with the expected antics of youths on vacation in the woods, but the franchise introduced a campy element with Part III, which pretty much plagues the rest of the series with the exception of maybe Part IV, Part VII and the reboot in 2009. Not that I'm complaining much, as these films are only quasi-believable anyway.Released in 1989, Friday the 13th Part VIII Jason Takes Manhattan is a nice change of pace as the series was suffering from banality at this point; the previous two installments and Part IV are prime examples (people complain about Part V but at least it had an interesting new kind of story with Tommy Jarvis going to the halfway house in the woods seeking succor for his psychological trauma, etc.). Not that I dislike those entries, but the basic Friday formula was getting tired and they needed to try something new. Part VII tried something new with the Carrie-like protagonist, and that entry has a great finale, but it was hampered by a subpar cast of women and forgettable dramedy. Part VIII changes things up by switching the normal location of Crystal Lake (and surrounding area) to a ship going to Manhattan with a group of high school kids and adults aboard. Of course, Jason also gets on board and starts systematically wiping out the youths. A handful of them make it to Manhattan, but so does Jason! I have to admit to enjoying the different settings of Part VIII. The story is split into four parts The prologue takes place on Crystal Lake and features Jason's resurrection -- a great opening. The brief first act takes place on the shore of Crystal Lake with the youths and adults boarding the ship. The long second act takes place on the ship and the final act involves the surviors on a lifeboat and their adventures in Manhattan chased by Jason.Jensen Daggett stands out as the heroine Rennie and places as one of my top 3 or 4 Friday girls. Peter Mark Richman is also notable as Rennie's peculiar stepdad and Scott Reeves as Rennie's sort-of boyfriend.Sharlene Martin is a highlight as Tamara and the filmmakers show off her curves, but she's so devious that she's a turn-off despite her good looks. Kelly Hu is also on hand.The main complaint I hear about this entry is that it's called Jason Takes Manhattan but only the final act takes place in the city. This criticism never made any sense to me as the film spends more than enough time in the big city, at least 35 minutes. The fact that the entire second act occurs on the ship keeps the movie from being one-dimensional.One thing that spoils the continuity and believability of the series is that this installment reveals that Crystal Lake isn't really just a small lake with camps and houses sporadically scattered around it; it's actually some kind of inlet since cruise ships can dock there and go out to sea -- why sure! Interestingly, Jason's facial F/X (shown at the end) aren't as good as the previous two installments, but they're serviceable.As far as locations go, Part VIII was shot in Vancouver & Britannia Beach, British Columbia; Los Angeles (the alley way & warf scenes); and Times Square, Manhattan (the ending).Many people find these films scary and shocking and the first two movies have some slightly chilling aspects, some of the others as well, but &#x97; with the exception of the 2009 reboot &#x97; I don't find these movies particularly scary, although they have loads of jump scares. They're sometimes creepy, sometimes suspenseful, sometimes exciting and always fun & entertaining, but not very scary, for me anyway. In fact, I usually bust out laughing at the inevitable death scenes.BOTTOM LINE Part VIII is a worthy entry in the series and is notable for trying something new by placing the main cast in a cruise ship environment and the big city, plus Jensen Daggett is a highlight as the female protagonist. It's actually better than the previous installment and Part III. The film runs 100 minutes.GRADE B- "},{"Title":"Garbage Sequel","Date":"30 June 2014","Score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":" Friday the 13th Part VIII Jason Takes Manhattan is the worst Friday flick from the Paramount era - Beating out Part 7 for the dishonour!

And a film that doesn't exactly live up to its title. A better title for this woulda been Friday The 13th part VIII Jason somehow manages to hi jack a cruise ship and kill everyone whilst defying logic. Either way, I can imagine people sitting in the theater in 1989 thinking to themselves This has gotta be IT!. And unfortunately, it kinda was. One thing I noticed this time that I never did before is how Jason kills only 6 or 7 teenagers on the cruise ship. yet before all the mayhem begins, it's shown that there are indeed more than just 6 or 7 of them. An entire class, in fact. Where did they all go? Did Jason kill them off camera? Or did they all get tuckered out from their 80's style partying and go to bed early? Doesn't matter. No one in this movie seems to care about anyone elses death. Not even their own, really. I love how near the end while the four remaining survivors are in a cop car that crashes, and then explodes seconds after three of them hurry out, while they leave the one female teacher in there to burn to death, with nearly no acknowledgement whatsoever. Then, they just stand around while the down there and it screwed her up. So, now, Jason is apparently the same age as this teenage chick. Despite the fact that 15 or 20 (or 30?) years have supposedly passed since part 2, when he was already a grown man for quite some time. Nevermind the fact that we still haven't even made it out of the 80's yet. So, we get what? Less than 1/3 of the movie taking place in Manhattan? Brilliant! The ending was stupid, yet sorta satisfying at the same time. Jason's new frog face was hilarious. His look of Horror when he saw the toxic waste heading for him was just epic. And then in a shocking twist, after Jason , the main chick's , that she was looking for way back on the ship, shows up out nowhere just to make it an even happier ending. You gotta be kiddin' me!But while watching the last few minutes, it occurred to me that the next installment, Jason Goes To Hell, coulda been taken a little more seriously had there been one more F-13 to link the 2 films. I think such a movie could still happen. I always wanted an Friday the 13th part IX which ignores Jason Goes To Hell and everything after it. But what about a Lost F-13 which makes all the ones after 8 make a little more sense? It could even be officially listed as a 1991 movie. Unlike Friday The 13th Part VIII, that could actually work! 5/10 "},{"Title":"And here we go again...","Date":"20 November 2004","Score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":" I really wonder what the hell was wrong with American teens back in the eighties.

I have no idea why, I have just always had an uncertain fondness for this instalment in the so far, 11 part series. For some strange reason it is surprisingly watchable. As it essentially consists of a pointlessly re-awoken, unexplainably slimy Jason plodding about on a cruise liner heading for the big apple, knocking off one by one, each nubile teenage passenger in various inventive ways until just a select handful are left. Just from that brief outline I think we can all safely assume that it's not one heading for the Oscars, but it is very entertaining. With a body count of over 20, each of which are pretty memorable and a length of just under 90 minutes....well you do the math. This proves that there is never a dull moment throughout and those with a sweet tooth for comic violence will be in movie viewing heaven. A definite guilty pleasure.

The particular acting of Scott Reeves who plays Sean Robertson and Peter Mark Richman who plays Charles Mculloch is especially criminal. I'm lost for words what paramount were thinking when they decided to do this movie. They should have left the series, which seems now to be going into a 10th!, at part 6. Part 6 was a cool movie, I have also commented on this so check it out and I guarentee that reading my comments will be better than settling down and watching the shambolic part 8.What particulary amuses me is at the start of the movie, when Jim and Suzie are on Crystal Lake in their boat and Suzie asks Jim what the matter is. He then replies, Just remembering this summer camp, where all those murders took place..... She then unbelievably replies What murders?!. WHAT MURDERS???!!!!, is she and the writers of the script and storyline insane???!!!. In England, everyone has heard of Jack the ripper, and how many murders did he carry out?. Not many. In America, there have been many serial killers that have gone on a insane rampage and how many have they murdered?, possibly in extreme cases 10-15 and American people have heard of those unique cases. It's different though with Jason Voorhees though isn't it. He must have killed over 200 people up to part 8 and she's acting like she has never heard of him!. Rather amusing.Well, I wasted enough time watching this movie so I'll spend no more of my time commenting on it.

The gimmick to set this in New York city is just that as a good portion of the run-time is set on a ship allowing Jason to do his typical routine of killing mostly teenagers one-by-one without there being too many people around to do anything about it. The strange thing is though is that the ship is void of almost all staff members. The kitchens are empty, the engine room is unmanned and there's no cabin crew, so either the company that runs it is soon to go bankrupt and this is the last voyage, or the movie has nothing but contempt for its audience. The movie improves somewhat when Jason arrives in the city, but the fact that a slow moving killer can go about his business with millions of people about is more a desire to add something new than an actual good in itself.

This is the already 7th establishment in the commercially successful Friday the 13th movie, that started out in 1980. That means that almost every year a new Friday the 13th movie got released. This of course goes at the expense of the quality of the movies and the series mostly consists out of stories and moments that repeat itself. This movie tries to be different by setting the movie at a new location. No, it's not really Manhattan, at least not until for the last halve hour of the movie but it's a movie that for most part is set aboard a ship, with a school-class aboard.The change of settings doesn't help to make this a better movie though. Even more so than other Friday the 13th movies, this movie just simply consists out of the one killing after the other. Its story and characters just aren't exactly good or interesting enough to make this a good or original enough entry in the series. It just no a movie you ever really get into.Guess the movie in its essence showed some potential. I mean an horror movie set aboard a ship should be good enough to provide the movie with a couple of claustrophobic and well build up horror sequences. But none of it. As an horror this movie falls flat and it just purely relies on its graphic killings it seems.The movie does get better though the moment the movie hits New York. It shows that having Jason roaming around in the big city can be just as good and effective as having the movie set at a camp, somewhere in the woods. Guess this movie also made the creators realized this and later movies in the series would also be set outside of the woods. It took them only 7 movies to realize this though.Not a very good or interesting done movie, until its final 30 minutes.5/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Silly bit of fun","Date":"29 January 2009","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":" So, forget Part VII, we're back to the over the top stupidity of VI.

An electrical hose is damaged by a teen couple's yacht anchor awakening Jason from his slumber thanks to a charge that refreshes his corpse. After finishing them off and snatching a brand new hockey mask the male on the yacht had appropriately enough on board, he secretly hitches a ride on the cruise ship Lazarus(appropriate title for a cruise harboring a killer who understands the meaning of returning to life)with a graduate class of obnoxious teens to slaughter in various ways(..not to mention the ship's captain and assistant). A good portion of the film consists of Jason killing people on the cruise because director Rob Hedden had to back paddle when he was informed that budget costs limited his work in New York City. Hedden does what he can with Vancouver to at least convince us those nasty alleys are smoking Manhattan streets with druggie undesirables as perfect fodder for Jason to destroy.Even if you think his methods corny, Hedden at least attempts to return a human face to Jason with the added sub-plot regarding the heroine Rennie(Jensen Daggett)reliving a terrifying childhood memory of nearly drowning thanks to Jason, the boy pulling her under after Uncle Charles(Peter Mark Richman, who is perfectly cast as the overly protective biology teacher on the trip always scolding everyone and barking orders to his students. He's quite an intolerable character)pushes her in trying to teach her how to swim. On the cruise ship, Rennie faces reminders of Jason, whether it be the child banging on a port hole begging for help as water fills his lungs, or the shivering child appearing as an apparition in her room. This sub-text feels inspired..at the very least, Hedden tries to inject life into a tired franchise fresh out. I think it's when he feels obligated to retreat at times to the slasher formula with rather uninspired kills(such as the first female victim who doesn't even swat the harpoon spear Jason is slowly closing into her torso, or the hot high school bitch Tamara who gets stabbed, off screen, by a shard of glass from a mirror Jason shatters)than Hedden often fails. And, I know many have a problem with the closing sequence inside the sewer, but I admired Hedden's effort to end the series once and for all in a unique way..as the toxic waste flushes through the sewer, it, in a sense, removes the evil infirmities where we realize that truthfully within this sadistic monster is a frightened child now able to die in peace.There's an element of fun here if you're not too dependent on logic, or aren't too disappointed in the fact that the film doesn't cash the check as it proclaims on the poster and title. But, there's an energy behind the camera-work(love how they zoom in on Jason, particularly on the subway and in Times Square)and some good humorous bits such as when Jason finds a hockey sign(the way the camera frames Jason in front of it is a treat for horror fans of the series), when a group of wannabe gangsters retreat from their plan to mess Jason up for destroying their jukebox when he reveals his face to them, or the inspired diner scene where Rennie and boyfriend Sean(Scott Reeves)ask for help because a maniac is after them, with the waitress' response being, Welcome to New York. My favorite kill would probably be the way Jason murders a rock chick with her guitar. And, that kill with the steaming sauna rock..OUCH! "},{"Title":"Wow, not good.

Here we see Jason catching a ride with a luxury cruiser (the appropriately-named Lazarus), come ashore in Manhattan and continue his trek to slaughter almost everything in his path (though for some reason he does nothing to the dozens of people on the Subway). This was the eighth and final film that Jason Voorhees appeared in for Paramount Pictures before being picked up by New Line Cinema (and saved, in my opinion). Written and directed by Rob Hedden, who is known for practically nothing. He worked on a variety of television shows in the 1980s and 1990s for one or two episodes, and often times nothing really worth talking about (Knight Rider 2000 and Simon and Simon, for example). With all due respect to Mr. Hedden, I am under the impression he was given this film because he was about the least expensive writer and director available. But sadly, he also had the capability to make the film completely worthless even by low-budget standards.I don't think it's a big surprise that this film failed. There was basically nothing new going on (watching a guy walk without dialogue and hack things up is fun, but eight movies in a row?). No new mythology. No great death scenes (in fact, these are almost the weakest and least gory death scenes in the entire series).Jason's ability to teleport reaches an all-time high in this film. Even after getting a quarter-mile behind his victim, he still magically teleports ahead of them, sometimes even up a flight of stairs and then back down to the bottom. Sure, he can run when he really wants to, but not quite that fast.The victims weren't worth caring about. The dad or principal or whatever his role was supposed to be... annoying, to the point that nothing could redeem him. He would make a great vampire, but he's awful in this movie. The two heroes (the young lovers) didn't give me any reason to care about them. Everyone else was forgettable or unlikable. The heroin from the gang members (or whatever that stuff was) did not play into the film nearly as much as it should have. Apparently, it doesn't do anything the first time you inject it and driving a car is still relatively easy. I could point out a dozen other flaws and continuity errors. And sure, I could say it's a horror film and that's to be expected, but they really put no effort at all into making this one streamlined.Two best parts the boxing scene (though still not as good as the fight scene in They Live), and when Jason fights the cook. (The cook was played by the guy -- Ken Kirzinger -- who would take over Voorhees from Kane Hodder many years later, so it was almost like a Jason versus Jason moment. At the time this film was released, that meant nothing. But looking back, that's a fun thing to watch for.) The boxing scene is what most people remember from this film, I believe. And it's not bad, but if you're sitting through the whole thing waiting for that moment, you're going to be let down.I should also point out this is the film debut of Kelly Hu, who plays the very 1980s-dressed Asian girl in this movie. She's easy to miss, as her role is rather small and of no real consequence. But Kelly would go on to much bigger and better things (and thankfully become more attractive with age). You might know her from Strange Days, X2 or Cradle 2 the Grave... I absolutely adored her in the 2006 horror film Devil's Den alongside Devon Sawa and Ken Foree.If you like Jason Voorhees, you'll probably be okay with this film since you'll be getting what you've come to expect. But the thrills are smaller, the deaths less violent, the plot runs a little thin. This is possibly the least of the 11-part series, or pretty close. Watch the next installment Jason Goes to Hell, the best in the series, by far. That's the only cure for this failure.

And actually I had quite high hopes for this part, especially from promising title, even earlier two were so awful I thought it was that worse it could get. But I was wrong. Firstly the name is completely misleading, first hour we spend the time with Jason on a crappy boat and rest of the time in Manhattan's sewers. I expected this movie would be about Jason on Manhattan killing and chasing people but no, its about Jason on a holiday cruise, highly censored (and I'm not talking about MPAA cuts but showing style of killings in movie) so we don't even see most of killings. Plot is quite stupid and movie is boring. So I think its quite failed in its purpose, it wasn't entertaining or scary. I don't think this is Friday the 13th about all, its just a stupid and lame sequel. And I don't understand where they put 5 million in this movie (its highest budget on this series) there's nothing special in it, not in decoration, actors or anything.

He follows the waters until he hitches a ride on a cruise ship hired for a graduating high school class. There he finds a whole new set of young people to slice and dice.The cast and characters are mostly unknowns and forgettable. Peter Mark Richman is probably the most recognizable as teacher Charles McCulloch. The good part is that the kids mostly look like kids. Killing them is slightly more fascinating than the older 'college' kids from the other movies.Going all the way to Manhattan is a mistake. It takes a workable horror premise into silly camp territory. This gets really campy with the ruffians in the crumpling docks. That's the point where the whole endeavor completely collapses. The rest of the Manhattan stuff is just a waste of time.

I had said the 7th film was the worst so far. Actually, it's this one that's the worst. Everything is wrong with this movie, even the freaking title. Jason does not take Manhattan in this movie. All he really does is chase two people the entire time he's in New York. Anyway, that's the least of this movies' problems. Wanna know how Jason comes back in this movie? It's the most ludicrous one yet! He comes back by being electrocuted by a random electric pipeline on the bottom of the lake and the only reason that pipe shocked him was because some random people on a random boat just happened to drop the anchor in exactly the right place to cut the pipe. I'm not making this up, though I wish I was. Next we have Jason killing people on a cruise boat. I don't know why he decided to get on a cruise boat (probably because the script called for it), but that's not the main issue. Jason is literally never seen, despite the fact that it's a fairly small ship and despite the fact that he killed like four people. HOW DID NO ONE SEE HIM!? It kills me to even try and think about it! Okay next we have bad acting blah, blah blah, the standard Jason won't die, blah, blah, blah, and of course the idiots being idiots. Typical Friday the 13th formula with a few extra bits of awful. Just stay away from it and you will be perfectly fine.

The shipboard antics don't generate much interest or excitement - but when the scene shifts to New York, it becomes tolerable enough (with even a number of amusing bits such as Jason - wearing his trademark hockey mask - coming face to face with a large billboard with an ad for an ice hockey match, his being accosted by junkies and street gangs, and the scene where the heroine dashes into a bar screaming that a maniac is stalking her - followed by the unalarmed female bartender's quip, Welcome to New York!). The climax in the sewers - with Jason drowning during a flooding of chemical waste - is effectively handled as well.

Actually, as slashers go; this ridiculously silly effort isn't all that bad, and it certainly isn't the worst film in the series. The familiar Friday location, Camp Crystal Lake, evidently was worn out by the time of this film; and so we've got a location change to Manhattan. Actually, this is a bit of a cop-out, as the vast majority of the movie actually takes place on a boat bound for the Big Apple. Naturally, this boat is full of teenagers and Jason has stowed away on it. The film kicks off with a ridiculously silly sequence which sees a kid whose almost about to get laid distracted by the fact that he and his girl are at Camp Crystal Lake, where a bunch of murders took place. After a convenient and extremely ham-fisted flashback which serves as an excuse to educate anyone who has found themselves in an eighth instalment of a series they know nothing about, we see Jason resurrected by way of an extremely tacky electrical sequence...Despite the fact that it takes place in New York this time, part eight is a Friday the 13th movie like any other. The body count is ridiculously high and sees Jason Voorhees dispatching his victims in a variety of grisly ways. Strangely, the death scenes involving the girls seem to run the same course every time - namely, we get the girl screaming as Jason is closing in, and then he proceeds to kill them anyway. Why don't they just run away? Anyway, while a lot of people get killed in this movie, it's never very shocking. Somehow, director Rob Hedden has managed to create an ultra-violent movie that feels like something you'd have no problem letting your kids watch. Kane Hodder takes the lead role as Jason, and does just as well as any other big guy in a hockey mask would have done. The make-up on the killer under his mask is typically crappy and hard to take seriously, much like the rest of the film. The loss of Crystal Lake as a location does spoil it a little, as that's the place that is associated with Friday the 13th, and the rural atmosphere fits the tone of the series well; but since this is the seventh sequel, it really was time for a change. I can't say that I recommend this film, but there are worse slashers than this one and at least Jason Takes Manhattan is fairly fun to watch.

I still have a lot of hatred towards the film but this isn't because of the actual film. The film itself isn't too bad and you've got to respect the fact that the director was trying to add new life to a series but the series had already been worn thin. The biggest grip I have with the movie is that they didn't take advantage of a wonderful idea.Another problem with the film are all of the characters who are so obnoxious that you can't wait for Jason to get them off the screen. This film and the previous were trying to do different things with the story yet they continued to use the typical teenagers. The performances are all rather dull, especially the leading lady, which has to be one of the worst in the series.

A group of college graduates from Crystal Lake are about to set sail on a trip to New York but they have an unexpected passenger as Jason decides to gatecrash the party in a way only he can... A rock chick named J.J Jarrett (Saffron Henderson) becomes Jason's first victim when she has her head bashed in, the first victim but far from the last if Jason has anything to do with it...Written & directed by Rob Hedden this is the eighth film in the long running Friday the 13th franchise, I have to be honest & say I'm a fan of the series & while Friday the 13th Part VIII Jason Takes Manhattan isn't exactly the best film in the world I found it enjoyable & entertaining if nothing else. The script tries something a bit different this time around, it's the first time the series really dared to do something radically different from the original Friday the 13th (1980) all those years ago. Jason's still here, the hockey mask is still here, the mindless teens are still here, the killings are still here & the only thing that's changed significantly is the location. This is still a Friday the 13th film as far as I'm concerned. There's even a bit of The Poseidon Adventure (1972) hiding in here as well as the boat runs into trouble & starts to flood & the film is pretty cool when it gets to Times Square & to see Jason strutting his stuff there. I thought there was a bit too much unnecessary & pointless excess character development in this one, like Tamara Mason (Sharlene Martin) who gets a lot of screen time during the first half but is then killed off & forgotten, nor did I like the way Rennie (Jensen Daggett) had lots of supernatural encounters with the young Jason & it's never explained properly whether these were in fact 'reality' or just in her head. Anyway, it moves along at a nice pace, there's some decent kills, Jason's in it a lot & I personally liked it, it's not the best Friday the 13th film but it's a lot better than the next instalment Jason Goes to Hell The Final Friday (1990).Director Hedden does a decent job & the film looks OK, there isn't much style to it but the kills are reasonably well handled & Jason is as cool as ever. As with most of the Friday the 13th's this was cut to get a certain rating right down to one scene being totally re-shot & another shot five different ways & Hedden being forced to use the least gory take. What's left is a little on the tame side, a few impalings, some stabbings, a hot rock shoved into someone's stomach, a cool decapitation, a bloodless slit throat, someone has a needle pushed through their body, someone has their head bashed in with a guitar, someone is electrocuted & there are a few dead bodies. We also get to see Jason's rotten & mouldy face at the end when he takes his iconic mask off, a scene which contains some neat special effects.With a supposed budget of about $5,000,000 Friday the 13th Part VIII Jason Takes Manhattan is generally well made & competent throughout although some of the scenes supposedly shot in New York obviously aren't. The acting isn't up to much in this one & Scott Reeves makes for a dull hero.Friday the 13th Part VIII Jason Takes Manhattan is an enjoyable entry in the series in my opinion, it's not the best Friday the 13th but it's not the worst either. A must for fans of the series, like me so maybe I was prepared to cut it a bit more slack than most folk would.

I consider all the Friday the 13th sequels to be guilty pleasures (except that dreadful fifth installment) and I don't really support all the people who criticize them. The Friday series never were intellectual cinema experiences and it probably doesn't take you 8 film to find that out. So I see no use in bashing these film and if you hate them, just skip them. All of Jason adventures are amusing money-makers, intended for the fans. And this 'Jason takes Manhattan' perfectly fits in this slasher-structure. This film should better been entitled 'Jason takes a boat ride', as more than half of the film takes place on a cruise ship on its way from Crystal Lake to New York city. And, when arrived in New York, Jason doesn't get much further than the docks and the rancid slums. A group of high-school graduates are on their way to Manhattan for a city-trip and Jason cheerfully joins them as a stowaway. Our hockey-masked friend wanders around the boat and violently terminates everyone he comes across. The best characteristic about Jason is that he's the least discriminating killer ever! Whether a NY purse-snatcher or a young steersman who just informed us about his 19-months-old son&#133;.Jason Vorhees annihilates them all! Talking in terms of plotting, part VIII is weaker than the previous installment (The New Blood) that desperately tried to bring some creativity into the routine franchise. This film connects to the original by the main-heroine, who suffers from visions of young Jason pulling her down in Crystal Lake. But&#133;don't worry too much about the plot as the killings offer more than enough amusement and horror-fun. Favorite sequence definitely is when Jason takes about hundred hits from an amateur-boxer and then simply beheads his attacker with one clean smash! Go Jason, go!  "}]
