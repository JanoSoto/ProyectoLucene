[{"Title":"Some Credibility Gaps But A Fun Fugitive-Type Tale","Date":"1 April 2006","Score":"35 out of 40 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Mystery, Thriller","Review":" With two really good lead actors and people I like to watch (Tommy Lee Jones and Ashley Judd) plus an on-the-run-Fugitive-type story, I expected a lot. I wasn't disappointed, either, although it's a bit hokey.This is a very intense, involving story, a la the above-mentioned The Fugitive, except this time it's a woman chasing down her ex-husband who set her up for murder. Once again, we see Jones in his familiar role of chasing down the supposed-criminal.As interesting as the story is, there are some credibility gaps such as why Jones didn't have a picture of the ex-husband in the first place or the always-annoying hesitation-before-shooting at the end which saves the good guy...and a few other things like that which are unrealistic. Will Hollywood ever stop that nonsense? However, clich√©s aside, overall it's very entertaining and always fun to watch no matter how many times I see it. Both Judd and Jones are excellent in these kind of roles.

Sounds logical, since you can't kill someone twice. But when your dead husband suddenly shows up and you want your revenge, you can get that since you've already had the punishment. These are the circumstances Libby Parsons (Ashley Judd) finds herself in after she is released from prison, six years after her conviction. How and why the husband (Bruce Greenwood) framed her is not really important, he just did. Now Libby tries to track him down with Matty, their son, as her main reason. The problem is Travis Lehman (Tommy Lee Jones), her parole officer who is strict in his rules. He does not believe her, but of course we understand this will slowly change.'Double Jeopardy' belongs to the group of thrillers where you expect certain things to happen and you will see you were right. That is not a bad thing, but it means the road to those predictable moments must have something to offer. This film has some things, one of them is Ashley Judd. Maybe it was because I always like Ashley Judd, but for me she was the reason this film entertained me. She plays the clever Libby in way that keeps her serious but sometimes quite funny as well. Especially the sarcastic little remarks made me smile more than once. Tommy Lee Jones is reliable as always, especially in 'The Fugitive' kind of roles like this one is. Scenes between him and Judd are entertaining on themselves. Greenwood turns out to be a nice villain.Simply said if you do not expect too much of 'Double Jeopardy' there is a good chance you will have a really good time.

Ashley Judd plays Elizabeth Libby Parsons who loses her husband, Nick, during a Yachting trip with him. During the police investigation it is discovered that Nick was in a financial crisis at the time of his death but left a two million dollar life insurance policy collect. Suddenly a whole set of evidence is produced to reinforce the allegation that she had a motive to murder her husband and she is convicted of murder. There is a plot problem that in reality she would have to wait seven years if he went missing from a boat before the claim was paid and it would be unlikely she would be convicted of murder without corroborating witness testimony from an independent party. Nonetheless somehow she is convicted of her husbands murder and it provides the intrigue. In prison Libby studies law in order to prove her innocence and when she phones her friend Matty who has custody of her 4 year son she accidentally stumbles on the fact that her husband may still be alive. The insurance claim has been paid to her son and her friend can use the money in his care apparently. Libby also learns that once convicted of murder of someone that you cannot be sent to trial again over the same murder and its called Double Jeopardy in legal terms. Libby is determined to hunt down her Husband for what he has done when she is released. Libby is released into supervised sentence under parole officer Travis Lehman ( Tommy Lee Jones) but escapes custody and sets out to track down her husband to prove her innocence. There is lots of action and Ashley Judd is such a great actress that you become emotional attached to her battle through the film. Tommy Lee Jones also performs well in his role as he breaks ranks to assist Ashley in quest to be reunited with her son in freedom.

Ashley Judd is just annoying for the first hour or so of the film, and it isn't until the fugitive style chase begins that the movie gets really interesting. And this, of course, is where Tommy Lee's excellent acting is the most entertaining and fun. He has unfortunately been somewhat typecast since his spectacular performance in The Fugitive, but at least he has been typecast in a role that is always fun to watch and that he can always pull off excellently.I think it's pointless to try to argue whether or not the whole double jeopardy law can truly be handled in the way that it was described in the film, but as a crime film Double Jeopardy was pretty good. Judd's husband in the film is one of those characters that's easy to hate, and not only because of what he did in the movie. You just look at this guy and you immediately don't like him. That's good casting, but it also completely voided any effectiveness that his `auction' might ever have had. And how about that coffin scene! Who cares that no one gets buried in a coffin that has plenty of room for two! That was one of the creepiest things I've seen in a movie in years.Clearly, there is nothing spectacular about Double Jeopardy. It's not going to win any awards and it probably won't be remembered for very long. But it has a certain charm that can unfortunately only be appreciated if you're in the right state of mind when you watch it. Don't expect it to be as good as The Fugitive just because Tommy Lee Jones is in it (really, are any movies as good as The Fugitive?). I mean, let's face it, Double Jeopardy isn't even as good as Under Siege, but as far as a moderately entertaining crime thriller to kill a couple hours, you could definitely do a lot worse.

Judd plays a wealthy wife and mother, living in a waterfront home where she bonds with her sweet little son. When her husband (Greenwood) surprises her with a luxurious sailboat and takes her on a romantic jaunt, she begins to believe that their once-shaky relationship is on the right course. However, when she awakens in the middle of the night covered in blood and alone, she soon finds herself the target of a murder investigation. From this moment on, virtually everything that occurs in the film is preposterous in the extreme. Ludicrously, she is found guilty of murder, even more ludicrously, she only serves 6 years for it and most ludicrously, when she finds out that Greenwood isn't even dead, she believes that since she has already killed him once and been tried for it, she can do it again and not be prosecuted! The entire premise and title of the film is completely inane and impossible! That said, the result is still a fairly gripping and intriguing experience. One is advised to completely abandon all notions of logic and reality in order to wring some enjoyment out of the proceedings. Almost nothing that Judd's character does is either plausible or sensible. She finds out her husband is alive only a month or so after being sent to prison, yet she rots for 6 years and never seeks any sort of legal aid? Her stint in prison is laughable. Two burly bitches, who likely would be raping her nightly, instead bake her birthday cakes for her missing son. She is out of the clink about 25 seconds when she is missing her curfew and breaking and entering a schoolhouse. She then breaks away from her parole officer (Jones) and is on the run all over the US from then on, desperately trying to retrieve her son and kill her dead husband. Jones is somehow able to completely abandon his post in order to follow her everywhere she goes. Scene after scene of thoroughly unbelievable and unrealistic situations come up. And the biggest surprise of all? Somehow Jones and Judd make it work! This film was a big crowd-pleaser and, in fact, it does provide a considerable amount of entertainment. Jones is just playing a less-confident, less-powerful version of his Oscar-winning role in The Fugitive, but he does it well. Judd somehow manages to take the audience with her (especially the female audience) as she single-mindedly pursues her cretin of a husband. Greenwood does an effective job as the deplorable spouse. The outcome of the film is predetermined. The story is so full of holes it actually hurts. Yet the film still comes through out of sheer audience manipulation and actors' charisma. It was downright shocking to see Judd, in a DVD featurette, asserting how rock solid the story is. This woman is going to want some serious help with script choices if she plans to remain a star (and if Twisted is any indication, she's on the wrong path!)

I loved it. Easily in my top 20 all time and maybe top 10. I think it's a Mind Thriller. The ingenious way she gets Angie's phone no. The scene at the BMW dealer where she gets Angie's new address. Later, she obtains Nick's new and latest name and his address through a Kandinsky painting. She recognized the painting from a newspaper article about Angie's accident. It had been hanging in her house. She knew that all Kandinsky paintings were registered and used this to find Nick' New Orleans address.I'm aware of the relatively low rating of this film. I've read most of the reviews and many of them are not so complimentary. Many of these people have rated the movie as a 0 or a 1. This is one reason why the rating is so low. I will now address some of the most common complaints about the movie1. Double Jeopardy doesn't exist. The main plot point of the movie is that you cannot be tried for the same crime twice in America. Many - apparently knowledgeable - people have said that this is not true as a point of law. I'm not a lawyer but I would like to ask a question Has it ever been proved in a court of law? Has anyone ever murdered someone, paid their penalty, got out of jail, found the still alive person, and the killed them? I doubt that this has ever happened. If it does, I venture to say they would find the second murder justifiable.I have always assumed that Double Jeopardy does in fact exist. Even it it really doesn't, then what is the problem? In U.S. culture, it does exist. It is used as plot points in many movies. Why did Charles (Terry Thomas) give a gun to Stanley Ford (Jack Lemmon) in How to Murder Your Wife.2. No credibility. There are many action scenes in the movie. Each one is believable. Taken together, I guess one's credibility must be stretched. But, what is the problem? This is a movie that exists for our entertainment. Is it really so important that - although she was initially handcuffed - she swims to the surface in the bay, hits Tommy Lee Jones over the head with his own gun, and then swims to shore, is hard to believe. I enjoyed the scene. While watching it, I was not thinking that it's not credible. Was Barry Kane (Robert Cummings in Saboteur) more credible when he, while two hands were hand-cuffed together, jumped off a very tall bridge, and somehow swam to shore while police officers were in pursuit?3. Cops out of Double Jeopardy. The complaint was that although she initially wanted to kill Nick, she eventually only wanted her son back and thus reneged on the Double Jeopardy plot point. My response is that she changed her mind after she realized that Simon Rider had killed his wife. She now knew that he was more dangerous that she thought. She reverted to the no. 1 priority which was to get her son back. This is not spelled out in the movie and so it's a little like Hitchcock, isn't it? He loved to make the viewers think for themselves.Speaking, of Hitchcock, I have wondered, what if this movie was exactly the same except he was the Director. Then what would the IMDb rating be? I maintain it would be close to 8.0.4. Too Predictable. Yes, I admit it was predictable. I knew the moment she went to prison that she would get out and eventually be reunited with her son. So what? The ending was one of the most satisfying I've ever seen. I watched High Noon for only five minutes and knew that the Marshal (Gary Cooper) would have a gun-fight at the end of the movie and that he would win. Didn't stop Gary from winning an Oscar at all.5. Lacks Suspense. Suspense is not a concrete thing. I can only answer this complaint by saying that, for me, it was very suspenseful. When she found Angie Rider's new address in Colorado and, before going to the door, preparing the gun - was this not suspenseful? Many situations in the movie were suspenseful. 6. The Annoying Hesitation Before Shooting. When Libby (Ashley Judd) and Travis (Tommy Lee Jones) confronted Jonathan near the end, I agree that it was annoying that Jonathan hesitated before shooting. This allowed Travis to jump on him and eventually, allowed Libby to kill him. I didn't like it either but it didn't bother me. This seems to be the Hollywood way. In summary, Double Jeopardy is great entertainment. It's clever, suspenseful, and has a tear-jerking ending.

( she says with a valley girl tone and a glistening smile )So seeing as that is not the case in real life, then logic dictates that they would have to ask for some form of ID in order for the name change to be legal, and if that is the case then this movie is impossible right from the get go.  Simon or Johnny or Nick or whatever his name is in the film is a successful business man and he therefore has to fill out tax forms and that means that he has to have a SIN and he probably travels so he has to have a passport.  Wouldn't the authorities then wonder why his other ID was that of a dead man?  You would think they would.  That is just a hunch.  But again, all this is heresay as you can overlook tiny errors like this if the film is redeemable.  Sadly this one not only isn't redeemable, it down right stinks.  And I mean it stinks badly.As everyone has mentioned before, the trailer for this film gives it all away.  Why should anyone even see this film when you know that she is convicted of a crime that she didn't commit, you know she goes to jail, you know she is hell bent on revenge, you know she is going to have a confrontation with her husband and do the talking killer thing explaining to him that she can't be convicted of the same crime twice and you know that a resemblance or an ersatz Samuel Gerard is going to chase her around the country only to finally be the only one that believes her story.  I was honestly waiting for Newman to go fetch him a chocolate donut, the ones with the little sprinkles on top.  Or for him to say  do you know that Devlin and McGregor made 7 and one half billion dollars last year?  That company's a monster.  Or for him to say.... well you get the idea.  Tommy Lee Jones has the same everything that he did in the fugitive, only in here he is one dimensional and he is pathetically boring.  His character had a chance to be interesting because they briefly gave him a background and then they inexplicably forgot about that background.  To the makers of the film, Tommy's chance at character development goes no further than showing him in a bar sipping a shot of whiskey.  Just because his eyes are black like a doll's eyes, it doesn't exempt you from interesting dialogue.  Sometimes a dark and frustrated stare can work wonders in the right place, but not when I know nothing nor will I ever know anything about what makes Jones tick in here.  And that is the scripts fault for being so incredibly shallow and thin.  Actually thin is complimentary.  This script was anorexic.  I actually forget what Jones' name was in the film!Double Jeapordy is the kind of film that has nothing going for it.  When you have a film that can't even utilize Jones properly then you have problems.  He is in the class of actors like ( IMHO ) Bill Paxton, Sam Elliot, Kevin Spacey, Michael Rappaport and Omar Epps, guys that can keep you interested in a bad film just by their mere presence.  But not in this one.  Jones can do nothing to make his character work and consequently there is nothing that can make this film work.  I mean please, are you going to tell me that when you stuff someone into a coffin, you are going to keep them alive and just let them die over a period of what? seven or ten days?  If you were so concerned with this person, why not kill them first and then stuff them into the coffin?  This is just one of the tiny discrepancies in the film.  And as a reviewer and as a reader of reviews, you know it is a bad sign when you start cutting up tiny things like this.  This film is awful and the saddest thing is, it had so much potential to be a great film.  It had a good director ( Beresford ) and two really good leads ( Jones and Judd ) and a good supporting role by a vastly under appreciated actress (Gish) who is basically window dressing, she is given nothing to do.  The only reason this film opened strongly is because of Jones and my bet is when American Beauty is released North American wide on October 1st, it will bury this piece of garbage in the same cemetery that they found this script.  This is truly an awful film that leaves a stench so bad that it may be right outside your window right now.  Can you smell it?  I know I sure can. 1/10  "},{"Title":"What's wrong with you people??","Date":"2 August 2002","Score":"5 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Mystery, Thriller","Review":"  I couldn't belive it when I read these comments and most of them were negative.

Since I'm a student, I didn't have to pay a dime. I had wanted to see this movie a few months ago when it came out, but time didn't permit.Previous writers have written in on the gaping plot holes in this movie, the recycled performance of Tommy Lee Jones, and even the absurdity of the title, considering that the Double Jeopardy clause to the 5th Amendment to the Constitution has nothing to do with wrongful convictions, only acquittals. They're all right. The premise of the film started out as ridiculous, and the plot was contrived beyond believability. I read the comments above and shrugged and said So what? In most of the movies I've seen Tommy Lee Jones in, he is essentially the same character, with just a few tweaks here and there. Take a good long look, and you'll notice that Travis Lehmen in this movie is a carbon copy of Brad Little from Firebirds, Sam Gerard from The Fugitive and US Marshals, Mike Roark from Volcano, Agent Kay from Men In Black. Jones CAN stretch his style when his scriptwriters give him something that calls for it, (see Under Siege, Batman Forever, JFK and April Morning), but most casting people seem to want to give Jones the gruff and taciturn roles. Scriptwriters meanwhile bless him with lines that can be hilarious, inflammatory or dead serious, but will all be delivered in Jones' trademark semi-bored voice, usually without his face cracking a smile. If Jones is okay with this trend, I'm okay with it. It doesn't do much for variety, but a little familiarity is good every now and then.As for Ashley Judd well, I thought she was enjoyable to watch while she was hyperventilating on the dock. Granted she might get sick at any minute, but she'd look good doing it. I'll refrain from commenting on her acting, since I'm obviously biased, sucker for a pretty face that I am. Whether it was good or bad, it will almost always be good to me. Bruce Greenwood played his part well, as an utterly contemptible money grubbing scoundrel. By the time the action moved to Louisiana, I was actively rooting for his violent death.The movie has a heroine that's lovely to watch, a hero that's fun to watch, and bad guy that's easy to hate. Couple that with a few good one liners, and nice photography of the boat and of Louisiana, and I think it's an enjoyable movie. Granted it's silly and unrealistic, but I for one can look past that, given it's assets. I'd recommend this movie for Judd fans and Jones fans, just not for serious crime drama fans.

Double Jeopardy is a dramatic thriller that is based on the legal premise that a person cannot be tried for the same crime twice.  As to the actual legal feasibility of this concept, you might want to contact your local prosecuting attorney's office, but I wouldn't count on it holding up.Ashley Judd, who is really turning some heads in the press with this movie, is a wife married to a husband too clever for her own good.  Libby Parsons (Judd) is neatly set up by her strikingly good looking husband, played by Bruce Greenwood.  If you get that feeling of I feel like I've seen him somewhere before it's probably because he's done numerous, if rather unmemorable roles in movies and TV for years.After the seemingly happy couple embark on a little overnight cruise, Libby is discovered by the Coast Guard in the middle of the night, standing on the deck of the anchored pleasure boat.   A bloodied knife in her hand, bloody foot and handprints decorating the boat, and no sign of her husband anywhere send Libby on a downward spiral into what we can see is a nicely framed conviction for murder.  Realizing that she doesn't want to see her son become a ward of the state, she blithely puts him in the hands of the child's young and pretty teacher, Angela, who is  played by Annabeth Gish (Mystic Pizza and Hiding Out are her more well-known films from the late 80's).After a couple of tearful visits to the prison with plexiglass separating them, Libby loses contact with her son and his newly-adoptive mother.  Her need to find her son starts her on an investigative and resourceful path to locate the woman with whom she entrusted her only reason for getting through this nightmare situation.  She locates Angela and her son by phone, and brushes off the woman's lame excuses for disappearing, demanding that she put her son on the phone.  Suddenly, a man walks into the apartment, and the boy shouts Daddy!, followed by Libby being abruptly cut off as the other phone is ripped out of the wall.Realizing that she would sound just like every other person in the prison system who claims to be  innocent and/or the victim of a frame-up, she continues to track them as best she can on her own from behind prison walls. Her despair is turned into motivation when a fellow inmate (who used to be a lawyer before she trespassed against the law) enlightens her on the legal premise of double jeapordy.  She contends that if Libby's husband really is alive she could truly murder him without worry since she's already been tried and convicted for his murder once.  Thus inspired, revenge fuels her into training like an Olympic athlete hopeful to wile away the time until she can get out on parole to even the score.When that blessed day arrives, she calmly moves into a half-way house that is run by a no-nonsense Tommy Lee Jones.  His character, Travis Lehman, has a less than pristine past himself, but seems determined to repent by keeping the house of female convicts on the straight and narrow.  The combination of the two stubborn but clever characters of Judd and Jones is entrancing and hypnotizing to watch.  Libby is hard not to like since she's a smart and resourceful woman who does what needs doing to find her son, and gets the pleasure of making her husband squirm in the process.  Jones' role as the less-than-angelic convict custodian, Lehman, is also likable since he is eventually able to tell the difference between what's right and what's justice.Although this is by no means an Oscar caliber film, I certainly found it to be quite entertaining and worthwhile.  It's very clever and yet has enough emotion and ironic humor involved to offer most everybody what they might like in a movie. Tommy Lee Jones is terribly talented and always a big draw, but I will admit to feeling that the whole concept of him chasing various fugitives from the law may stale quickly if they try to draw from that well again after this one.

This is a riveting portrait of revenge.  The villain is up-to-date and bad; the heroine, cunning and driven by the reclamation of her son.  From the last frame to first, I was glued to the screen.  You will be too.Ever since Ashley Judd portrayed a crack whore in SMOKE, I've been smitten by her.  I tried not to let that persuade my judgement, so I confess to it up-front.  Tommy Lee Jones is excellent as always.  When you pair the two, I am bound to enjoy the outcome.  So in deference to my bias, I awarded 3 stars by starting with 4, then subtracting for flaws.The major flaw involves the prison environment.  Perhaps I've seen too many H.B.O. OZ episodes, but her subsequent parole halfway house seemed more prison-like than the prison depicted. After 6 years there, Libby (Ashley) seemed relatively unaffected by the experience.  I have to imagine cold-blooded murderess country clubs are few and far between in Washington state like anywhere else. . . . 1/2 a star, denied.Minor flaws accounted for another 1/4 star's deduction.  The cemetary coffin result was illogical to me (though admittedly possible.)  The trial scene was contrived yet critical to delivering an acceptable plot.  The unwinded elderly art dealer catching up the well-winded, younger Tommy Lee after his fugitive chase didn't make sense.  There are others, but you can see them for yourself.  Minor stuff  Nothing to impede your enjoyment trust me!The cut to the chase scene following Ashley's burglary is top shelf. She's on foot vs. the police Jeep's pursuit through beach sand and surf.  It is unique and keeps the high tension on the wire. Terrific!All of the daytime Washington state outdoor photography is spectacular. The film is paced well and the scenes naturally fold from one to the other.  I enjoyed this film in a relatively full theater.  We gasped, laughed and squealed in all the right places.  A handful even applauded at the end. (But I can't tell you why, obviously.  See for yourself)For those doing the star math en route to 3, I deducted a quarter for my bleary-eyed  acceptance of Ashley and Tommy Lee for matters confessed in the second paragraph above. Deal with it.  See this movie at your first opportunity.  It is worth every minute invested.

Her husband (Bruce Greenwood The Sweet Hereafter) is a successful businessman, she has a precocious four year-old boy, and her child's nanny is a caring, loving woman who places the child's needs before hers. Out on a weekend retreat in a boat on a nearby lake, Elizabeth wakes up one quiet night covered in blood, with footsteps leading outside to the water. Her husband is missing and Elizabeth is suspect number one. Sent to jail for the murder of her husband, Elizabeth pleads her innocence and becomes increasingly aware that she might have been framed. Upon parole six years later, Elizabeth begins to track down the suspects who might be able to explain what happened on the boat that night and why she cannot find her son. In pursuit of her is a crusty old parole office (Tommy Lee Jones) who also becomes aware that Elizabeth just might be telling the truth about her innocence.Directed by noted filmmaker Bruce Beresford, it should be established that even this man has a spotted record. For every brilliant Driving Miss Daisy, Mr. Beresford has made a Silent Fall to bring his ego back into check. He can be a powerfully manipulative director, and as junkily tangy as Double Jeopardy is, it's also a return to form for the director after past failures.You can think of this film as Fugitive lite. A thriller who's conventions are nothing new, but approached with a freshness and grace that many other contemporary films cannot seem to muster. Shot with gorgeous widescreen luster and written with some cleverness by Douglas Cook and David Weisberg, Jeopardy is the kind of autumn diversion that makes moviegoing so much fun. You can't really tell what's going to happen next, but you know exactly where you're headed.The screenplay by Douglas and Weisberg gives star Ashley Judd exactly what she needs right now. One of the more naturally gifted performers in her age bracket, Ms. Judd fits perfectly in the role of convicted murder Elizabeth. It would be hard to top her career defining performance in Ruby In Paradise, and lord only knows she's been floundering ever since. Jeopardy puts Judd front and center, right where she belongs. Granted, the film does feature some awfully abrupt plotlines. A small one involving Elizabeth never really fighting the charge of murder, and her subsequent time in jail are handled rather poorly, as if the filmmakers wanted to get going right away, liberally tossing aside narrative to get there. It's to Judd's credit that this familiar material works at all. She's a fine actress, and the right role will make her a superstar.With Tommy Lee Jones, the appearance in this picture is a bit dumbfounding. Quite literally the same Sam Gerard role he played in The Fugitive and the spin-off U.S. Marshals. Jones seems to be slumming for a paycheck in Jeopardy. I'm at a blank to describe any other reason to why Jones would appear in such a role. He's a unique actor with such a loyal fan base, I can only imagine a nation of fans feeling bored by the actor's work here. This isn't his finest moment.Besides the obvious Fugitive parallels, Jeopardy also features a very specific nod to George Sluizer's The Vanishing. Anybody who saw that film will easily recall the horrific resolution to the picture. While Jeopardy doesn't end anywhere near as downbeat as Sluizer's classic, one scene involving a coffin and a familiar camera move will surely drive the audience wild with claustrophobia. It's tough to tell if it's homage or stealing. Either way, it's that kind of moxie that makes Jeopardy rise above the conventions and remain a satisfying movie.Paramount Pictures seems to be the only studio in town to have an incredible knack for churning out decent to great adult-themed fare (Kiss The Girls, Payback, Simple Plan) for the off weekends of the year. Double Jeopardy should be yet another mid-priced success story for them. A reasonably competent thriller with a good cast, a watertight script, and a director with a definite affinity for the conventions of the genre. You cannot ask for much more than that.----------- 8/10  "},{"Title":"The Ultimate Movie Review! - http//tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078","Date":"27 November 2013","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Mystery, Thriller","Review":" The law of double jeopardy states that once a person is convicted or acquitted of a crime, they may not be tried for the same crime again. So, when Libby Parsons (Ashley Judd), discovers that the husband she's been convicted of killing is actually still alive, she goes on a mission to hunt him down. There is one problem though, her parole officer is determined to stop her. This is one of those films that for some reason you easily forget about. I saw Double Jeopardy when it was in the theaters and totally forgot about it, until it was on TV last week. It's only then that I remembered just how intense it is. Ashley Judd is truly a fantastic actress when she's in the right role, and trust me, a scored, lonely woman is the perfect role for her. Tommy Lee Jones has a somewhat smaller part than we are used too, but he's as amazing as he's always been. The chase for Libby easily brings back memories of Marshall Samuel Gerard. The only knock against this film is that it is unfortunately somewhat predictable, if you're looking for a shocking twist in the story, you won't find it here. The extreme nature of the story and the terrific acting more than make up for the predictability though and the film is perfect for those times where you just want to be entertained without having to think too much.

Nick, however, is in big financial trouble, and they are about to lose everything; and Libby knows nothing about it.  Under pretense of buying her a boat, Nick takes Libby sailing, alone.  During the night he disappears, leaving behind evidence of his apparent murder, and orchestrating it to incriminate Libby.

Adamant in her quest to locate Angela by tracking her through a series of phone numbers, she finally succeeds; and also discovers that Nick is still alive.  And with Angela.  Frustrated in her attempts to get someone to listen to her story, Libby can do nothing but serve her time, and wait.  After serving six years in prison, she is paroled, and begins searching for her son, armed with a useful bit of information she learned on the inside  The law of Double Jeopardy; since she's already been convicted of killing her husband, she cannot be tried for it again, even if she shoots him in front of a crowd in the middle of Times Square.  She does have one more problem, though.  Her parole officer, Travis Lehman (Tommy Lee Jones) is out to track her down for violating her parole, and If he catches her, she'll go back to prison. 	Outstanding performances by Judd and Jones highlight this film, along with some nice touches by Beresford in keeping the tension high while moving it along at just the right pace.  Judd makes Libby believable, infused with a vulnerability and determination that makes you pull for her; she's a strong woman who's been wronged, and you desperately want to see her get her life put back together.  Jones is convincing as the hard-as-nails Lehman, who doesn't see parole as a second chance, but as a `last' chance.  Beneath it all, however, you know that this is a man who also believes in justice, and will do what he can to make it so.  Greenwood gives just the right touch of boorishness to Nick; he's like the successful used-car salesman you never want to have to deal with, and you wait for the moment when Libby will finally get her crack at him.   	The supporting cast includes Annabeth Gish (Angela), Michael Gaston (Cutter), Roma Maffia (Margaret) and Davenia McFadden (Evelyn).  In a world in which the unjust too often prevail, it is gratifying to at least see the attempt made of putting things to right.  `Double Jeopardy' does just that; it takes you on a wild ride and gives you hope at the same time.  Maybe it's only a movie, but it's a good one.  And sometimes, that'll just have to do.  I rate this one 8/10.

Judd plays the wife of a multimillionaire businessman who is framed for the murder of her husband (an ersatz murder, by the way, whose logistics are never explained either to Judd or to the audience), spends six years behind bars and then, when released, goes in search of not only the husband she now knows is alive and well but the son whom she has not seen in all that time.  Tommy Lee Jones co-stars as her parole officer who, at first, attempts to inhibit her search then, becoming convinced of her truthfulness, joins her in her effort to exact proper revenge.The film sets up its framework on a very shaky premise.  We are expected to believe, idiotically, that Judd is free to murder her husband for real this time with full impunity, covered by the double jeopardy legal argument that one cannot be tried twice for the same crime.  Any film that believes its audience is that gullible is unlikely to win over too many converts.  Similarly, are we really to swallow the fact that a man as professional as Jones' parole officer appears to be would leave the keys in the ignition while his prisoner sits in the car handcuffed to the door handle while he goes looking for a cup of coffee?  And would a man who has managed to eliminate two wives so successfully and establish himself as a pillar of the community under several different aliases allow himself to be fooled so easily into confessing his crime into a concealed tape recorder?  Such lapses in logic permeate this entire film. The movie does deserve credit for keeping the Judd/Jones relationship a strictly platonic one, thereby avoiding the romantic cliches that could truly overwhelm the proceedings.  And Jones nicely underplays a role that, in other directorial hands, might have lent itself to hyperbole and bombast.All told, however, I'm afraid that one's enjoyment of Double Jeopardy is predicated mostly on how willing one is to suspend critical judgment and go with the facts as they are presented.  Unfortunately, the film is not tightly edited or suspenseful  enough to allow the audience to ride over all these crests of incredibility.  The result is a watchable, but neither compelling nor memorable, piece of pulp fiction tripe. "},{"Title":"Great!!!

Her son is kept under supervision but one call leads to the suspicion that her husband isn't dead after all. This all boils down to revenge fantasy outcome.

After released she searches for answers and we all know where that leads. Tommy Lee Jones is ideal because he pursued Ford in The Fugitive, so he can merely recite. Bruce Greenwood as her so-called deceased husband is indeed despicable and nearly kills her. He will be placed in a difficult position when rendered to a choice. It is unfortunate that one of those choices wasn't choosing a different script to act in. Annabeth Gish plays Judd's friend whom she leaves her son with. This role is small yet pivotal and hopeless.

She accidentally discovers that Greenwood and Gish have betrayed her and run off with the kid.Six years go by. Judd is paroled under the supervision of the hard-nosed Tommy Lee Jones. But she skips, and by means of some tricks discovers that Greenwood has murdered Gish and moved to New Orleans where he is now a pillar of the community. This greatly irritates Judd, who tracks him down, with Jones in hot pursuit.There are some pretty good action sequences. It's not often an escaped prisoner, manacled to a car door, will start the car and race it off the ferry's aft ramp. And there are other exciting moments. At one point, Judd is knocked out and wakes up to find herself locked into a coffin in one of those above-ground mausoleums in New Orleans' famous All Saints Cemetery.Judd isn't bad. She gets the job done. But she's been able to do more than that in some of her other work, most notably Heat. Still, it's enthralling to witness her features at times turn into a pageant of fleeting expressions. Tommy Lee Jones, an inventive actor, is more or less wasted in a reprise of his role as the obsessed and gelid representative of justice in The Fugitive, some five or six years earlier. Too bad.As thrillers go, this one isn't as repulsive as many others. Is there a car chase? Are you kidding? The double jeopardy business is a lot of hooey. The attempt to jack up suspense -- leaving open the question of whether Judd will walk up to her delinquent husband and blow his brains out in public -- interferes with the purer motive that these commercial enterprises require -- namely, a mother's desire to raise her baby.

Double Jeopardy is about a beautiful lady called Elizabeth Parson (Ashley Judd) who 'apparently' murdered her husband on a yacht on one particular night. She has been prosecuted for her 'alleged' crime and served many years behind bars but during those years behind bars, she strongly suspects that he could still very well be alive, and she sets out to seek the truth and bring justice once she finishes her sentence. Problem is that despite serving her sentence, Elizabeth also known as Libby (Ashley Judd) is under parole for a further 2 years under the watchful eyes of a parole officer called Travis Lehman (Tommy Lee Jones) so Libby (Ashley Judd) has a very tough task in seeking out the truth about her husband despite her release. Like I have mentioned, the film was good which will keep the viewer interested, but plot to me seemed a tad weak and could've been a lot better. One of the major things that makes this film good is that it is emotional, you the viewer will strongly feel for the character that Ashley Judd played - Libby and will instantly support her mission in seeking out truth and justice. From a personal point of view, it is hard to swallow that an innocent and caring woman can be locked behind bars for several years, but the beautiful thing about it is that the character Libby can keep her composure and be so patient to seek the truth. I didn't want these sort of things to happen since I'm too emotional, even though its only a movie, but yeah it does get to you and this is what makes the film pretty good.

This makes sense to me. When in prison, Libby is informed by one of her 'ex lawyer' convict sisters that as she has already killed her husband, and been convicted, she can do whatever she likes to him and not be convicted. She takes this on face value, and sets off on a variety of montage scenes to show her gaining fitness so she can accomplish this very task. Up to this point the movie seems like its setting up for an interesting story line.This is were it all starts to fall apart. Libby is released on parole after serving 6 years in prison. 6 years for a murder sentence? Sometimes you just have to accept these things in films so i will. Following this she makes what is possibly the longest list of stupid decisions I've ever seen a character make, including breaching your parole to steal a document from a school, making it extremely obvious which document you stole to directly identify you, getting on what is the most ridiculous chase scene from the police I've ever witnessed, including a beach buggy flip scene for chasing a suspect on foot, driving a car which you are handcuffed into in the river, and selecting a cemetery as the scene for which you meet your husband who is out to kill you. After these ridiculous amount of breaches in all logic from the main character who is suspected to be the one 'in control', she than continues to flirt with her ex husband, demanding her child back. Wasn't the whole point of getting out to commit your revenge? As a final touch to an already ridiculous series of events, they are going to fake her death and indict him with it at the end as some form of threat? By this point in the movie i was just watching one ridiculous scene after another take place with no obvious common sense from any of the main characters. This movie on face value really does seem like one of those classic 80's mystery thrillers, and i must admit, despite the ridiculous plot i was entertained, and its worth seeing, once.

The plot is unrealistic, but as most of the films I see out of Hollywood tend to be unrealistic, this was no better or worse than many. I like Ashley Judd and Tommy Lee Jones, and they did their best with the inadequate script. I have read the other comments on this film at this site and most have been scathing. I think that's a little unfair, I can think of far worse films than this. For a Sunday afternoon thriller, this film entertains and gives enough plot detail to keep your attention. I'd rather have a slightly second rate thriller with Judd and Jones, than a dozen silly comedies or dull romances. The 'double jeopardy' of the title - where you can't be tried twice for the murder of a person - is an interesting concept, and it was good to see Ashley turn the tables on her diabolical husband.I have to say, I enjoyed this film, and I liked Judd's efforts. She tries very hard with her material - she just doesn't get good enough parts. Tommy Lee Jones is always good, if predictable. Having seen Judd in Frida and been impressed with what she did with a very small role, I am looking forward to her Linda Porter in 'De-Lovely'.

Yes there are a few alterations, but it's a vaguely similar plot with Tommy Lee Jones trying to find the person on the run&#133; again. But despite these similarities, Double Jeopardy is an above average (if not predictable) cat-and-mouse thriller.The lead role goes to Ashley Judd who plays a woman trying to find her son after being imprisoned for six years, though she didn't seem to age at all, and find her husband who framed her. Judd gives her breakthrough performance and is quite convincing aswell. She got the role when a pregnant Jodie Foster pulled out (who would have delivered the role with equal oomph). Tommy Lee Jones plays the parole officer/policeman trying to track her down (does that not seem a tad familiar). He's standard for the part but didn't exactly jump off the screen. The film keeps you on the edge of your seat up until the end, but after watching it you'll probably instantly forget it. There's nothing really wrong with the film, but it's just not very memorable.

Double Jeopardy was one of the movies they happened to grab during a going out of business sale at a local video rental house. And let me tell you what a find this was.  It is, perhaps, the worst pile of crap ever made or thought of.  Here's the recipe You take a writer who comes across a term like Double Jeopardy (that's concept) and decides I'm going to turn this concept into a story.  The only thing is, concept does not = story.  Ever.  Never never never.  So, he spends 100+ pages trying to weave this concept into the culminating moment where whats-her-face squares off against her ex-husband who faked his own death and got whats-her-face (ah, yes, Ashley Judd) put in prison.  Since she was tried and convicted of his murder, she can't be tried again, and she goes to kill him when he finds out it was all a big set up.  And, somehow, Tommy Lee Jones is drug into the mix.How?Well, let me tell you.  You see, he was the head of a half-way house for women, and when Ashley Judd escaped, it, for some reason, became HIS job to chase her across the country.  Now, I was asking myself  Jeff, what happened to all those badass women that he was supposed to be looking after and disciplining?  Apparently, nothing.  I assume when he got back to his real job, the women would have been gone.  But, the writer, and the director, and the producers all figured The hell with it.  What's one little hole?In the end, all this movie turns out to be is drivel.  A moron writer with a concept that had to piece together the concept with a climax and the melodramatic lines something to the tune of You're going to kill me? Double Jeopardy.  I can't be tried for the same crime twice. Bang. Roll credits. Seven dollars well-spent.Not.

Well, to my surprise the training scenes lasts only about 3 minutes and she definitely smokes the sucker.

First of all, I have some serious doubts about the truth of that particular interpretation of the double jeopardy clause.  I'm not a lawyer, so I'm not an expert, but then neither are the filmmakers.  Secondly, I had a very hard time sympathizing with Libby as she did so many stupid things early on in her parole (breaking into the preschool and wrecking the car on the ferry come to mind).  Being back in prison for violating parole wouldn't have helped a bit. I kept thinking, why didn't she just go to the police as soon as she had any evidence that her husband was alive, and nail him legally?That said, I did enjoy the movie more as it went on, especially once she arrived in New Orleans.  The auction scene was a brilliant idea, and the scenes with the husband were tense.  Of course the audience is onto the ploy in the cemetery early on, but still it works decently because of its chilling development. I was pleased to see the way things worked out with the husband, and the ending is touching -- maybe a little sappy.  Those who don't have children will probably find it sappier than those who do; I always find enough in that sort of scene to identify with, to forgive the over-the-top emotional tugging going on. I don't imagine that works for people who have no basis for comparison.Overall, this is a movie worth seeing if it's the kind that interests you, and you can suspend your disbelief for a while.

Of course in Hollywood, nothing this good can last, and for Libby her ordeal begins when she awakens on a sailboat to find her husband gone, leaving behind only a knife and a whole lot of blood.  The coast guard quickly arrives on the scene to find Libby holding the murder weapon (talk about perfect timing!) and she is soon charged with the murder.Of course Libby is convicted, thanks to woefully inadequate counsel and an unbelievably lenient judge--lenient to the prosecution, that is.  With Nick dead and Libby unwilling to put her son through the hell she went through in her parents' house, Libby's friend Angie agrees to take Matty in and adopt him.Does this sound contrived enough yet?  Wait, there's more!  Angie skips town with Matty, and Libby tracks her down through some clever detective work.  While on the phone with her, Matty to call out, Daddy!  Is Nick alive?Fueled by rage and realization that the fifth amendment would allow her to legally murder her husband in cold-blood, Libby connives her way through a parole hearing after six years' imprisonment  (or is it eight?) and hits the streets searching for her not-so-dead husband and more importantly her son.  Assigned to a community house under the administration of one Travis Lehman (Tommy Lee Jones), she quickly violates parole and leaves Lehman up a creek (literally) as she races off on her quest.What follows is nothing more than a remake of _The Fugitive_, and we soon come to realize that _Double Jeopardy_ is essentially standard Hollywood fare with a gimmick that ultimately has very little to do with the story line.  But where _The Fugitive_ was cleverly written with compelling characters and motivations, _Jeopard_ is packed with coincidence following unbelievable coincidence until the entire movie feels too contrived to be enjoyable._Jeopardy_ also suffer from the nagging plot holes.  For example, it doesn't matter if Libby can be retried for her husband's murder; she violated parole and will never be allowed to live with her son in peace.  Also, despite Libby's lament of her childhood, she visits her mother who treats her kindly and even helps her financially.  Why was it she wouldn't let Matty live there?_Double Jeopardy_ refuses to allow us the necessary suspension of disbelief because the flaws are so obvious we can't help but notice them.  Thankfully Judd's resolve and Jones' wit, combined with a healthy dose of action and suspense, are enough to keep our interest until the unfulfilling showdown.

She was very believeable in the role, even though the plot around her was full of holes and moments where you were required to overlook certain things (such as, How come no one ever seemed to recall that this guy whose picture was undoubtedly in newspapers during her trial was still walking around?).  But that's just a minor quibble.Tommy Lee Jones, with his sad puppy eyes and kick-ass attitude, makes for good watching as always.  His role is a little too much like Sam Girard in The Fugitive and U.S. Marshals, but I'm sure screenwriters have a hard time distancing him from roles like that which he does so well.

That is absurd. Did the makers of this film attempt to contact any constitutional experts? Double Jeopard prevents the state from trying anyone again after they they have been aquited of a crime. It does not protect you if you commit the same crime against the same person twice. Even if you never have committed the first crime it does not excuse the second crime. The film fumbles over the simple idea. Ashley Judd is pretty good in this movie, as a woman who desperately wants her kid back. Tommy Lee Jones plays a less effective character, who is pretty well played but his motivation to follow the woman is lost. Everyone else in this movie is pretty ineffective, including the evil husband who apparently didn't even change his looks from his previous identity.The first third of this movie is okay. The trial is hardly believable, with 2 major atributes, the fact that a body was never recovered and whether the blood was even her husband's on the boat, never discussed. Then in jail, which is so great her hair stays the same, she finds during a phone call that her husband is still alive. The best parts of this movie are her in jail.Six years later she's gets on parole with a parole office who's very strict played by Tommy Lee Jones. Not wanting to wait three years she goes on the search. She uses clues which at first was interesting, but the clue that finally leads her to her husband is so unbelievable, why couldn't they think of something a little more smart and realistic. All this way her parole officer follows her even though he knows nothing about her except that she may have a son. It seemed like there was a bread crumb trail everywhere she went cause he was always right behind her. How does he even know who her supposed husband is, an obvious flaw. The ending isn't an entire disappointment, but it's utterly predictable, and hardly thrilling. No surprise this movie ends with her and her son in her arms. Double Jeopardy has good elements but it hardly works as a thriller with it's utter obsurdities. It could of at least of been a little more smart and less predictable. This movie is not terrible but it is a thriller to be forgotten. I give it a 5 out of 10, not too low mostly because of Ashley Judd's performance.

When she finds him in New Orleans, she just asks for her son back. She spends six years in prison and is on probation for three and she doesn't want any revenge on him. Hard to believe!!Another thing that I didn't understand is why Nick didn't alert the authorities as soon as he saw Libby in New Orlean. If she gets caught by the police down there, she goes back to Seattle, he doesn't have to worry about turning over their son and she's out of his life for good.Another thing that was stupid was that despite the fact that Seattle and New Orleans are fairly big cities, Travis Lehamn (Tommy Lee Jones)surprisingly kept running into Libby on the streets and around town. Wow, What a small world.There were a lot of other things that made no sense, but it would probably take me forever to list them.

Don't get me wrong, the movie is entertaining and I like it a lot, but the story just annoyed me.  One thing before I start-  Ashley Judd was horrible when she cried in court (it was about as fake as it gets.)   Most of the positive comments on this movie have said something about Judd being a great actress...but let's be honest.  Besides horrible actors, most other actors are about the same.  I mean, there is a notable difference between say, Alicia Silverstone and Judd, but they both act about the same.  The only difference is the fact that Judd get's alot better roles to show off her talent.  Anyhow....let's go on. First off, like someone pointed out in the goofs section of this movie's page--double jeopardy does not work like this.  It works for the plot, because most people don't realize this.  Most states in the United States have laws where if convicted of murder in one state and aquitted or in this case- the guy turns out to alive in reality, you CAN be convicted of murder again...if you leave the state to do it.  She did leave the state, so it's quite possible that Louisiana could convict her again.  Even if the state didn't have such laws...she would go back to prison anyhow.  First off, she broke parole (that probably wouldn't matter if the original charge was dropped) but...you have to think about it.  If she goes and kills her husband with a guy, she'll get 20 years for the weapons charge alone!  So, this entire idea is ridiculous. Secondly...how on earth does Judd get away every time?  I know that if she doesn't, the movie sort of has to end, but come on!  Give us some realistic situations here.  No way she would be able to escape Jones everytime like she does.  It's so bad, it's funny. Next, when Jones goes to New Orleans and talks to her husband...he doesn't know it's him, because he changed his name and all.  BUT--He was Judd's parole officer...I'm sorry, but he would have had some sort of access to the records of her case and subsequent trial.  All he would have to do is get his hands on those files and find the guy's picture, and realize it was him the whole time. Fourth--No way Judd would just go to New Orleans and expect her husband to hand over the kid like that without a fight.  She tells him she just wants her son, and she'll let him go.  If she did that, she would go back to jail, because she couldn't prove he was still alive!  Not to mention it's a bit hard to believe that she would just go there, trust him to keep his mouth shut and give her the kid without any problems.  In the cemetary, only an idiot would believe that was really her son!  And, there is no way she would follow the kid all around, while losing sight of the husband that framed her for murder! Next, you're telling me she found her husband's location by seeing a TINY piece of a painting on the wall in a newspaper clipping?  I don't think so. Maybe I missed something, but how did she find out who painted it and the name of the painting so quickly? Another thing.  She supposedly killed her husband, she gives custody to the family friend, the family friend takes the kid away, moves in with the supposed dead guy, but no one discovers any of this?  That's a bit far fetched. Finally...in the end of the movie Jones and Judd are in her husband's office in New Orleans.  They get the evidnce they need to frame him, and tell him all about it. He knows if they get away, he'll go to prison forever...yet Jones walks Judd to the door and they completely take their eyes off the husband, giving him time to get a gun from his desk and shoot. Nice..... Like I said, the movie is entertaining, but there are so many plotholes, you'll be screaming by the end of it all.

It was a movie that kept me intrigued and entertained, its story was very well-written and original, while the acting was brilliant, Ashley Judd is an absolute winner, and the directing and production of the film finished it to just about perfection. There are hardly any faults in Double Jeopardy, it has the right length, good certification, but it is a bit flat on the lines sometimes. But I promise, you'll hardly notice it. Ashley Judd is Libby Parsons, a young mother of 1 who has taken a relaxing trip with her husband (Bruce Green). But it is not as relaxing as she had hoped, when she finds a trail of blood on the deck of the boat early in the morning, and it looks as though her husband has committed suicide. Yet the police see a different story. They think Libby has killed him, and sentence her to jail for 6 years. When she gets out, she has only one thing on her mind. To kill her husband. Because according to the Double Jeopardy law, you can't kill someone twice.

Main thing that was a drag the trailer gives the movie away completely. I mean, the big PAYOFF scene (and line) is even in it! Another reviewer said it best-I felt like after seeing the trailer, I was watching the movie for the second time upon first viewing. Execs have argued, 'well, the trailer got the audience into the theater bigtime, so there'. That's no excuse...I guess for the execs, it works out great, but for the audience who pay to see a movie and want at least a TINY bit of surprise or suspense and feel let down, it's just not fair. There were a few good scenes; most not given away ahead of time. My favorite moments were those that were not in the trailer; the scene where a cute young guy shows Libby how to use the internet and then tries to hit on her, and she gets rid of him by telling him exactly how she has spent the last 6 years very openly and cheerfully .Though it was a good scene, I couldn't help thinking, come ON lady, you haven't got any action in 6 years for Chrissake and this hot, adorable young guy is asking you out for a drink (the guy was great-looking, friendly, and most single women who hadn't got laid in a month or so would have gone for him at the drop of a hat)what the hell, are you made of wood? I also liked the scene where Libby finally tracks down her evil husband and stages her first meeting with him for maximum dramatic effect, and is dressed to kill to boot. I loved Judd's two tough prison pals, though at the start I expected the bigger one to end up making Judd her (insert typical Prison Babe Movie cliche here). Tommy Lee Jones is always fun to watch. Even though he played pretty much the same character/storyline as he did in The Fugitive and the sequel, I'm not complaining. The movie is worth a rental, at least, if you are bored. It does entertain and I did find myself rooting for Judd a few times. But again...if you've seen the trailer, you've pretty much seen the movie. I wasn't too impressed.

Ashley Judd did an excellent job; her mama-on-the-mission role was very convincing. The Double Jeopardy law does confuse me, though. In this case, it wouldn't necessarily be a problem for her to murder the SOB and get away with it, since he probably deserved it anyway. But what if it was a case where someone was raped, the guy was sent to prison, and then 10 years later he got out and did it again to the same person? Would that be okay with the law, or is it really the SAME crime, since it's a different occasion? It's something to think about, anyway. But my compliments to the directors and actors of this movie.

According to the movie, Judd goes to a car dealership (I think BMW) and asks a dealer to run a credit  history check on Angela Green (by giving him her social security number)  as if she was wanted to buy a car. I have no problem with that - it's actually a smart way to lookup a person's address BUT later in the movie we find that the mistress (Angela Green/Ryder) has been dead for 3-4 years. Now, I would think that the credit report or whatever report a car dealer gets would say DECEASED or something similar. The dealer seemed not to care the woman who came to buy a car is dead (or obviously impersonating).This might seem like a small thing but it just kept eating me throughout the movie.

The plot of Double Jeopardy closely resembles that of The Fugitive but doesn't parallel it exactly.  Tommy Lee Jones, also a supporting actor playing a cop in The Fugitive, is her parole officer after Judd is accused of murdering her husband.  The prison scenes seem alarmingly short for a six year span and Judd's character doesn't seem to age at all, physically or mentally.  She doesn't play the prison-hardened, desperate con too well; her face is too innocent.  Towards the end the plot is rather predictable, but the action scenes are engaging and keep you following the movie.

Most of them have already been discussed by some of the other viewers who have posted here, so I'll just do a brief enumeration of some of the ones that stuck out in my mind (and this is far from a complete list)(POTENTIAL SPOILERS)1. Most obviously, the film's ridiculous misinterpretation of the double jeopardy laws...this might have been acceptable if it was just Libby's misunderstanding of how it works, but the movie has not one but TWO ex-lawyers presenting it as correct!  (I guess that's why they're EX-lawyers...)2. The idea that an insurance company wouldn't at least look into Libby's story, especially on a $2 million policy.3. Libby has a car dealer run a credit check on another character's social security number, while impersonating that character.  The credit check turns up that person's last known address, but not that she's been dead for three years.4. Travis leaves his prisoner alone in the car with one hand free, and the keys in the ignition.5. Nobody on the ferry notices as Libby noisily bumps into several of the cars around her, not even when she knocks one of them overboard.  However, when HER car goes over, everyone comes running.6. Libby fails to notice that the youth she's following in the cemetery is not only considerably older than her son would be, but is also carrying a beer.7. After knocking Libby out, Nick doesn't bother to make sure she's dead before dumping her in a potentially-escapable coffin and leaving her.  (Shades of Dr. Evil & Austin Powers!)8. After going to so much trouble with his evil plans, Nick casually (if vaguely) confesses to someone he barely knows.And those are just a few of the errors and plot holes.  However, the movie is far from a complete disaster.  Beresford's direction moves the proceedings along smoothly, no matter how far-fetched they are, and the performances of Ashley Judd and Tommy Lee Jones are highly entertaining.I wouldn't say this movie was worth the effort of renting or going to the theater, but if it comes on cable or if a friend picks up the tape (which is how I saw it), it could make for enjoyable escapist viewing.

I expected to find a film where the husband was always looking over his shoulder, not unlike the Julia Roberts character in Sleeping with the Enemy.  Instead, having used this concept as a hook to draw me in, they virtually ignore the idea, to the point where the husband seems more annoyed at having ex-debtees find out he is still alive than worried that is wife can kill him.  Bummer.  I never felt that the husband felt threatened by Ashley Judd's character at all.Now then, being a Washington Ferry Boat rider, I simply have to take offense that the car drove facing forward off the back of the boat.  Not often do they have you back onto the ferry--maybe it was a Southworth run on the Vashon ferry.  Not very likely.  Also, one heck of a lot of people simply sit in their cars, reading the paper or snoozing.  If some idiot were driving back and forth smashing the cars ahead and behind, then pushing one off, there would be attention paid immediately to the situation.  AND, that chain across the back (front?) is pretty firmly anchored in the deck with posts.  Oh well.I am also amazed to believe that Driver's License photos from people believed deceased are available six years after the death.  My, the Washington Dept. of Trans. is really an efficient organization.  NOT!!

Umm.. Wrong! With a premise like that, the credibility of the movie goes way out the window. The legal term 'double jeopardy' means one cannot be convicted of exactly the same crime twice, not just the charge. If I were accused of killing a man at 830 in a bookstore in New York on November 13, 1996, then I can never again be convicted of killing that man at that time in that place on that date. All of the specifics need to be the same, not just the I killed a man part. But obviously, since so many people watched and liked this movie, the actual veracity of the plot is mostly immaterial. My personal opinion is that with so many rotten ex-husbands in the world, any movie in which one gets killed TWICE is going to make beaucoup bucks! So forget the implausible plot and focus on the action and the drama. Ashley Judd is Libby Parsons, the accused woman in question. Judd turns in another of her fine performances as a woman who will do almost anything to get back to her young son, who of course was taken by the seedy husband. Tommy Lee Jones is her parole officer (!) who seems like a bit of a jerk at the start, but lo and behold comes to believe in her cause. Actually, Tommy Lee's character is a little tough to figure out. Is he a good guy? Is he a bad guy? Does he have ulterior motives?

Libby Parsons(Ashley judd) is convicted for the murder of her husband. she is later sent to jail but soon finds out that her husband faked his death for reasons you have to find out when you see the film. so when libby gets out it's a cat and mouse chase. because libby has all the cards on her side. supposedy it's a 5th amendment right that you can't be convicted for the same crime twice. so basically from her own words she can shoot him in the middle of mardi gras and no one can touch her. Sounds good right? but there are some flaws.Some aspects of the story seem very unbelievable. this is the kind of film that might sound good on paper but when it is executed you realize how ludicrous it is.But this film does entertain despite a bad script. there is plenty of action and good pacing. everything happens fast so you're not bored with the film.The acting is what keeps this movie from going to hell. Ashely Judd proves that she can carry a film on her own. she is a great actress and she has great screen presence. very strong femlae actress. all the credit goes to her. she carries this film.All in all pretty entertaining but with this film you just can't get buy all those flaws that keep it from being a great movie.

I wasn't sure I would like Ashley Judd in it, though. I had seen her before, of course, but she hadn't made much of an impression. It was to my pleasant surprise to find she is what I liked most about the picture. She is not a great beauty, but that works to her advantage, as she is better able to convey her role as a tough, everyday Mom (though filthy rich), caught in a very difficult, emotionally-draining situation, with greater conviction.And, hey, she's certainly not that bad to look at. This is basically an action thriller, with one basic twist it's a woman who is the purveyor of this action. I can't think of many movies with this twist...Nikita comes to mind, as does Barbarella, but not many mainstream Hollywood movies; and not with this same feeling of realism. Ashley Judd pulls off the action sequences with aplomb. It was a little tough to find some elements of this movie credible, but an exiting story, a slick production, and a good performance by Judd, easily overcomes this. Oh, and Tommy Lee Jones plays his usual self as her pursuer.

Through a rather silly legal loophole, it transpires that since she can't be tried twice for the same crime she can now hunt him down and kill him in broad daylight and walk away scott free. Ashley Judd, who is greatly changed since her Star Trek appearance, carries off her r√¥le with ease and style, and Tommy Lee Jones (perhaps getting a little type-cast) is very good as always. Bruce Greenwood is very good at being evil and switching in and out of a New Orleans accent - pretty much all his character calls for. A slightly weak premise, and occasionally pithy scripting don't really take away much from this movie. It's not a deadly serious intellectual movie, and isn't meant to be.

Why does that matter? The movie is meant to entertain audiences, not take them on a school field trip.I found the movie to be riveting. Ashley Judd pulls off a wonderful performance as Libby Parsons, a woman wrongfully accused of murdering her husband. Tommy Lee Jones plays the gruff parole officer with whom Judd convinces of her innocence, but not before first taking the viewer on action packed getaway scenes. Judd, who is becoming the prototypical, strong willed woman who gets even with all the wrongdoing put forth onto her, pulls you into the emotions that Libby is feeling. Especially the love and frustrations concerning her son.

Ashley Judd plays Elizabeth Parsons, a woman falsely convicted for the murder of her husband. While in jail for this crime she finds out, fairly unrealistically, that, oh my god, HER HUSBAND ISN'T REALLY DEAD!  After the filmmakers shoddily push her through six years of jail, she goes about trying to find her husband and her child.  Sounds pretty, you know, average.  It is.The story never really finds anything to focus on. We don't get a really good chase down the fugitive story, because we don't ever really get to care about Tommy Lee Jones character.  A side point, the best part of the movie for me was the way that Jones played the character.  He was gruff and amusing and was the only character that I was really excited about. The directors never seemed to be able to find one place that they really wanted to go with the movie.  They bring up the whole double jeopardy thing...but, it's only brought up...and then sort of discussed at the end of the flick again.  Also how can you make an interesting fugitive movie, if the fugitive is only running from her...parole officer?Ashley Judd is a beautiful actress, that's no doubt.  But she seemed to struggle with making the character anything but generic.  It was fun to look at her, but she's no one I'm going to remember in a week.Overall, the story was slow and had problems going anywhere.  Tommy Lee Jones helps to save the movie, and so does the cinematography in the movie, wide, expansive; a different take on filming a boring genre.I'd have to give the movie a 6/10.

He just needed to brake her neck or to strangle her. Also How come he did not check her, just to verify she has not a weapon or a document with her? Beresfor made Nick Parsons stupid just because the film needed Libby alive.Another one since Lehman knew he was facing a cold-bloded murderer...... how come he did not watch Nick? This is not a proper attitude for an experience cop. I am not a cop, you are not likely a cop, but you would keep an eye on a murderer.For last, I did not like Ashley Judd.

But it was half price Tuesday so I decided it would be a good two hours' entertainment for the money. Double Jeopardy is a perfect example of getting what you pay for. For half price Tuesday it was just right. The premise is a bit doubtful, but then I'm not a lawyer so it may be realistic. Unfortunately it tends to overwhelm everything else in the film - characters, storyline and action. Many of these elements are far too contrived for sustained believability and end up getting sacrificed so the idea can live on in shining glory.One of my pet hates are scenes where the hero/heroine is the only one in the entire cinema who can't see the bleeding obvious, such as the graveyard scene. There are numerous examples of character stupidity - Libby wandering around New Orleans in full view without the least attempt to disguise herself. It's strange that Lehman, being so interested in Libby's case, doesn't know what her husband looks like until a convenient plot point. And yes, she couldn't have swum that far without somebody noticing. In these situations the film descends into genre cliches. Which is a pity because there are real moral dilemmas here to be explored, but Bruce Beresford seemed determined to make a light easy-on-the-eye piece of fluff to entertain the masses and make the studio money. He is capable of better than this. It's not a bad film, but it's not memorable. Ashley Judd looks exactly the same throughout the whole thing, not like a woman who has had to endure 6 years of prison. No wonder her son had no trouble recognizing her. If she kept calling me kiddo like that I'd disown her anyway. Tommy Lee Jones is just Sam Gerard again which is a major disappointment.There are some fine scenes - the coffin scene really does evoke horror and a wrenching empathy from anyone who has suffered claustrophobia. But it's far too predictable and hackneyed. And the ending was a complete copout. Where are the themes of personal revenge versus parental love for Libby, duty versus personal involvement for Lehman, individual rights versus social responsibility etc?

And also, Tommy Lee Jones follow the fugitive to get her back in prison. It seems to me a little familiar.When we look at the trailer, the film seems interesting because of the subject and also because we know another law that we cannot be guilty two times for the same crime.  The main character will chase her husband and it's quite fun.  It surprises me.  But when I think more about the script, it looks like The Fugitive and other movie where innocents sent in prison get out to chase and to find the real killer, and they always succeed.  It is not realistic, but it's entertaining.The characters are normal and almost dull but the actors give them a pretty good interpretation, especially Ashley Judd who was very convincing.  It's a bit different for Tommy Lee Jones, not because he wasn't good, he is always good, but this character is too much like the one in The Fugitive.Bruce Beresford did a great job for this movie.  Most of the time, I do not like action movies because they are always the same.  But there are beautiful images in it and most of the action scenes are captivating and there was rhythm.

The film stars Ashley Judd as a woman framed for the murder of her husband and sent to prison, only to discover her husband is still alive.  If anyone knows what the legal term `double jeopardy' means, you can probably guess where this movie is heading.  This isn't a bad film, but it's not a great one, either; I liked it.  I liked it because Ashley Judd is my favorite actress and she gives a strong performance here.  I thought her last major motion picture, `Kiss The Girls,' was a much better showcase for her and the film, as a whole, was more successful.  The director, Bruce Beresford (Driving Miss Daisy), creates a nice mood throughout the picture.  One of the few problems with `Double Jeopardy' is that it's more of a drama than a thriller because there isn't much suspense.  Ashley Judd made a very sympathetic character, which brought this film up from total oblivion.  Her co-star Tommy Lee Jones was, more or less, playing his Oscar-winning role from `The Fugitive' but to a lesser degree.  I did like the fact that there wasn't a tired love story involving Judd and Jones' characters.  In a film like this, her objective is most important and there isn't time for an additional romance.  I also liked the look of the film, the cinematography in the beginning of the film was gorgeous, and Judd simply looked stunning in a black dress near the end of the film.  In conclusion, yes, I liked the film.  It had some rather interesting scenes and a nice connection between the leads.  Some of the prison scenes are good and Ashley Judd has never been better.

In the year where the 100th anniversary of Alfred Hitchcock's birth is being celebrated, here is the germ of an idea on which he would have put his indelible stamp of creativity. The film as publicized in trailers and TV teasers persuaded many moviegoers to want to see it. However, the advertising has given away 90% of the plot. What's left is a flatly photographed and flaccidly directed yarn with so many holes in it that the audience was audibly making comments as the heroine, Libby, gamely portrayed by Ashley Judd, begins her journey of frustration, determination, and revenge.  One of Hitchcock's ongoing themes is the wrong person caught up in events beyond his/her control (North by Northwest, The Wrong Man). Here Judd's character is wrongly accused and framed for the murder of her husband (Bruce Greenwood). Once she has an idea that he is not dead at all, why didn't she just call her lawyer? This is just one of the ridiculous holes in this Swiss cheese of a plot.  When one of her prison mates, the wonderful Roma Maffia, explains that she cannot be tried again for the murder of her husband (the double jeopardy of the title), Libby patiently builds herself up physically to exact revenge on him. Tommy Lee Jones is her parole officer who doggedly pursues her, first to recapture her, and later to help vindicate her. There is lots of action, pursuit and some suspense. Jones can play this role in his sleep. He is almost the same character he ably portrayed in `The Fugitive' and `U.S. Marshals'. The pity is in what could have been. Director, Bruce Beresford (Driving Miss Daisy) has definitely seen better days.

I think that Ashley Judd had a few marbles rolling around upstairs in this movie, but who wouldn't with some crazy husband trying to kill you.  I have always liked Tommy Lee Jones, but it seems that the movie doesn't pry into his personal life much.  It states that he has a mysterious past, but it never really goes anywhere from there.

But a 50-year-old movie would at least have some nifty film noir lighting and a few utterances of baby, swell and jernt to carry it along. All Double Jeopardy has is a preposterous premise, plot holes big enough to drive a Packard through, and dialogue that sounds like it was written five minutes before the cameras rolled. A serviceable Ashley Judd stars as a wife and mother who is rather expeditiously convicted and sentenced for the murder of her smarmy husband, only to discover a month after landing in prison that he is alive and well and living with the babysitter in another town. Honestly, if you were Judd, would you a) scream your head off to anyone who'll listen that you know the exact street address where your dead husband can be found right now, or b) elect to spend the next six years in a hellhole waiting for the possibility of parole so that you can track hubby down and kill him without repercussion?

But occasionally, by sheer force of will, appealing actors and slick direction can make even the most hackneyed script almost  watchable.Such is the case of Bruce Beresford's latest opus, Double Jeopardy, which is a showcase for the talents of the great  Ashley Judd. Judd plays Libby Parsons, an affluent wife and mother, who is charged with murdering her husband and sent to prison. For those of you who haven't seen the needlessly revealing trailer for this film, I will not give away any more of the laboriously twisty plot except to say that the holes in this swiss cheese of a script are big enough to drive a truck through.Fortunately for the filmakers, Judd is such a naturalistic actor that she gives a full three dimensions to her USA-movie of the week character. You find yourself suspending disbelief for the sake of Libby and her(implausible) quest for justice.Adding marquee value to this dreck is Tommy Lee Jones, who is playing a slightly seedier version of the character he played in the Fugitive and U.S. MarshalsIf you are a hard-core Ashley Judd completist, by all means, see Double Jeopardy.

The biggest ones I noticed were1) Double Jeopardy itself YES, you can be prosecuted twice for killing the same person, as numerous real lawyers have pointed out. Double Jeopardy protects you only from being tried twice for THE SAME OFFENSE. If Ashley's character killed her husband again in 1999, that would constitute a separate offense at a different time and place from the first murder in 1993. Pity that  she relied on such bogus legal advice from the two lawyers in the film. I assume that neither the writer nor Paramount Pictures bothered to do 5 minutes research on this key plot point.2) The plotting husband apparently had no difficulty getting his hands on his son's $2 million trust fund, which contained the life insurance payout, to fund his luxurious lifestyle.3) Ashley's character was paroled after only 6 years in prison for cold blooded murder. 4) After she broke into the school, the pursuing police vehicle turned over so violently that anyone inside MUST have been killed, badly injured or at least temporarily stunned - yet they had no problems scrambling out of the upturned wreck, resuming their pursuit of our very athletic, uninjured young heroine and arresting her.5)The heroine had the advantage of having the dumbest parole officer on the planet - he handcuffed her to the car while it was parked on the ferry deck, left her alone (what would have happened if the ferry started to sink with her cuffed to the vehicle?) and of course he left the keys in the ignition so she could start it and attempt to escape.6) No one on the ferry apparently noticed anything when Ashley started her parole officer's car and rammed the bright red car off the deck into the water.7) The heroine apparently had no difficulty getting the gun aboard the airliner for the flight to New Orleans.8) She also had the benefit of the dumbest murderer in the world. Her husband did not bother killing her quickly when she was completely at his mercy - he simply shut her inside a coffin at the cemetery, with a lighter and gun so she could shoot her way out.9) Her parole officer seemed at times too stupid to find his own backside in the dark, yet he had no problems keeping track of our rapidly moving heroine as she raced around the country. Of course, he had no problems finding her again and again in a crowded, rain soaked New Orleans, where just about everyone seems to be concealed beneath an umbrella.10) The apparently by-the-book parole officer cooked up a bizarre blackmail scenario to entrap the husband, instead of simply handing him over to the local police, along with the overwhelming evidence of his guilt.In a genre of movie which depends so much on clever plotting, the above defects stuck out like a gorilla in a kindergarten.   As compensation, the Pacific North West scenery is magnificent, the New Orleans street and cemetery scenes are wonderfully atmospheric, the art gallery and other interior sets are splendid, the cinematography is top notch, and Ashley Judd and Tommy Lee Jones are very talented and watchable. The technical and artistic workers deserved an infinitely better script as the basis for their obvious efforts.

The story line was doing well but, I was a bit disappointed in the extent of realism that went into the bloody scenes on the boat. Perhaps I had more problems with  story not picking up on the strength of the our now female heroine, Libby,  done wrong. Her steady developing realization of the events were well done and the audience was always moving with her.I had a bit more trouble with the lack of character strength that it seems to me was never written for Elizabeth. I was always excited that she made distinctions regarding what needed to happen in order for her to pursue the injustice of her husband, Nick.I would be remiss not to recognize her compassion for her son but later in the cemetery, I was disappointed that she would expose herself to terror so blindly. Again she should have by then been written as a stronger character. I'm getting ahead the story. Travis Lehman is developed as a believable parole officer, whose past has similar injustices as Libby.  Again my criticism, the screen writer continues to give a disproportion of strength to male roles. Also the intensity of the subplot chase within the search for justice, plot, never developed moments for passion that might have prepared for an expectation of more affection at the end.I really don't believe the balance of the character of parole officer had to be the level of our heroine Libby Parsons.  In the least it a lost opportunity for the screenwriter. The biggest weakness, in an otherwise remarkable story line, is a powerless Libby character not being savvy to her well-being in the cemetery. I really felt ambushed by script for Nick Parsons disrespect for the banal bashing of Libby on the stone mortuary. That was a major audience insult. I wanted Elizabeth to be a strong character for the sake of the compassion for her son, Bobby. The story line evolved to a close with Libby, the screenwriter weakened Elizabeth.  > If the director filmmaker, Bruce Beresford, could have developed the expectation of a long painful prison infirmary as Nick Parson just reward, and perhaps more important, built an increasing depth of character for Elizabeth I would have felt more satisfied.The movie had a great female heroine story line potential and for that I will treasure my experience.

Libby Parsons (Judd) has led a good life; she is married to Nick (Greenwood) she loves, a son named Matty (Clark) she adores and her best friend Angie (Gish) that she can rely on. However, the good life will become a nightmare as Libby is soon thrust into the spotlight and stands accused of her husband's murder while on a romantic weekend of sailing. Libby is convicted of Nick's murder and is sent to prison. Rather than have Matty become a ward of the state, Libby asked Angie to adopt Matty. After only one meeting between mother and son, Matty is taken to San Francisco where this film takes a surprising twist. This twist, which is the re-emergence of Nick Parsons takes Libby through emotions that give her a reason to get out of prison and find Matty. 10 years in prison and Libby is paroled to begin her mission to find Matty. One person stands in the way and his name is Travis Lehman (Jones). Filmed in Vancouver British Columbia, the first part of Double Jeopardy was enjoyable; however, it faltered in the latter half when it became apparent that it would be just like The Fugitive. Also, Judd's performance as the betrayed mother was overplayed and should have focused equally if not more about taking revenge on Nick. Director Bruce Beresford deserves credit when he changes the stereotypical combination of male cop versus male villain to having a vileness for a fugitive. As good as this film was, Jones needs to move on to pursue roles other than a federal marshal in pursuit of a fugitive. Double Jeopardy is worth the price of admission if for nothing else the reaction of Nick when Libby finally locates her dead husband. Double Jeopardy is rated R for language, a scene of sexuality and some violence.

Ashley Judd (who surely should have had top billing because of story, role, and acting) was strong in each facet of the character and circumstances of Libby Parsons.  Stunning visual impressions (for example, that sailboat we see as the camera lens swoops smoothly around it) and ways in which the visual told stories were exceptionally good.  In fact, I find I can almost overlook or forgive the other shortcomings of the film for these pleasures.  Almost.  You know the story already -- if you have been to another movie in the last few months.  After the faked murder, we don't get much insight into the trial, which seems to have been conducted by the family's (civil) attorney, which I suppose is appropriate considering the misinterpretation of the law which is reflected in the movie's title.  I guess the producers forgot to hire a real attorney to check the law.  We get a few vignettes in the prison and are reminded how easily the judicial system is influenced by contrition, whether real or feigned.  Next we have the female version of The Fugitive complete with Tommy Lee Jones (this time playing Travis Lehman) running after the runaway running after the not-really-dead husband.  Twists and turns of the plot give us mostly predictable actions. Let me say again....  Ashley Judd is a joy to watch.  She brings intelligence and depth to the character in the context of a flawed script.  I recall being captured by her performance (Ensign Robin Lefler) in Star Trek The Next Generation.  She is truly gifted.  And I want to see more, more, more of her in some good films.       Beyond the flaws of the movie itself, I also want to voice my objection that through the movie's title and the many previews, I already knew the story and had guessed most of its turns with only a few minor surprises.  I do feel it is an injustice of the movie industry to reveal pivotal scenes in advance promotion.  Some trailer scenes do not even appear in the final cut!  I am reminded of one of the BEST trailers I have seen  Albert Brooks talking about the film Mother several years ago.  He sat on a stool and told us about his relationship with his Mother (played by Debbie Reynolds).  We didn't see any scenes clipped from the film; we got a flavor of the theme instead of the actual movie.  While Mother is not one of the world's greatest movies (I did enjoy it), it's trailer is one of the greatest.  There is a current trailer (for Magnolia) which is also excellent  the members of the cast introduce themselves in character.My overall feeling of Double Jeopardy (essentially negative) is colored by the high marks for the two highlights  Ashley Judd and the cinematography.

There was no suspense of who did it or will he get away with it.All that can really be said about Double Jeopardy is that it had potential--great cast and good story idea. However, it just never came together. Part of this might be attributed to the marketing of the movie.

Double Jeopardy got me with all three.   The premise of the film being if your convicted of murdering a person you cannot be convicted for murdering that same person again therefore you can legally murder someone under these unusual and unlikely circumstances.  This offers a good starting point for a good thriller unfortunately the producers failed to find a competent writer to put together a plausible screenplay around the premise. It took about five minutes into the film for me to determine that DJ was going to be a turkey. To start with Ashley Judd just happens to wake up just a few minutes before the coast guard shows up so they can see her pick up the supposed murder weapon of her husband aboard a newly bought yacht . I guess we can assume film characters playing framed murders never watch TV or movies since this clich√© has only been used about  500,000 times and yet they keep picking up the murder weapon !! I'm not a lawyer so perhaps I don't know what I'm talking about but isn't a body required for a murder conviction !? So now we move on to Ashley in prison and her son & girlfriend caretaker have disappeared. Ashley is a smart woman and tracks her down and wants to talk to her son and then she hears her son call for his father and now Ashley knows her husband is alive ! Does Ashley call her lawyer and have him investigate the disappearance of her son & caretaker who have now run off with her husband ? NO, She decides to serve her term and go after her husband with the knowledge giving to her by a prison mate ex lawyer about double jeopardy !  Yea I guess I would stay in jail for 6 years too since I know I could track down my husband instead of trying to get someone else to do it for you so I could get now ! If you bought that one your brain dead !! My favorite one was when she gets out of prison and breaks parole and goes home to mama. Of course the police  would never think of looking for her there !? Mama has a nice wad of money stashed for her so she can finance her way around hunting down her lost husband. Oh I forget to mention her loser parole officer Tommy Lee Jones his ex wife screwed him and took off with his child that he hadn't seen in years ! Just a coincidence of course. Tommy's not too bright leaving his car keys in the ignition with an escaped parole in the car. Tommy is only stupid enough to keep letting Ashley escape his grasp but he gets smart when trying to help track down her husband and help her in the end.  You would think at some point in the film there would be an explanation for how Ashley gets setup but it never happens and all were left with is a silly chase film. Ashley doesn't even want to kill her husband she just wants her son. Well why did she sit in jail if not to use the DJ rule to seek revenge on her betraying husband ?! She ends up shooting him in self defense  not for revenge  like all good guys & girls are supposed to .  I enjoyed Tommy Lee Jones as he seems to always be good no matter the film and Ashley Judd is a doll but she is never convincing playing a character that should be far more dark and bitter considering what she was put through.

I KNOW I've seen some of these people act well before.  It's just like when I saw Runaway Bride - EVERYONE FORGOT HOW TO ACT there, too!!!  Is this intentional?  Are directors requesting that people become less real?  Maybe they're trying to dumb everything down to fit today's movie viewers???  I don't know what' going on, but I want answers. I have to admit, Ashley Judd's emotional reaction to finding herself covered in blood and then learning that they weren't able to recover her husband's body was incredibly convincing.  So many times I think actors just aren't there with really heavy scenes.  However, every other line she delivered, as well as the rest of the cast, was patheticly done. Oh - and how many times did we have to hear her call her son, kiddo?  Was that supposed to make us think that she's some really nice, great mom who could never kill anybody?  I think that's what that was.  Oh - here's a good one  When her friend brings the son in to see mom in THAT REALLY SCARY PRISON (ha), she tells Judd (I can't remember the names...I so much did NOT care) that she's taught her son the ABC's, I just cracked up!  I would certainly hope that that kid knew his ABC's WAY before he was like, 4!  That was clearly about a 4-year old child in the way he looked, spoke, etc.  Later, they show her celebrating his 8th birthday, and the next thing you know she gets out of prison and supposedly spent 6 years there.  Um, are they trying to tell me that that great big kid was 2 YEARS OLD when she went to prison????  I guess somewhere along the line, while the writer and director were spending all their energy on that great script of theirs, they just sort of forgot how old that kid was supposed to be. The most annoying thing, by far, about this movie was how incredibly EASY everything was.  There was not ONE MOMENT of tension.  Everything pretty much went exactly like everyone wanted it to go.  The husband's splattering of all that blood all over the boat AND his wife (heavy sleeper I guess) - (by the way, I've seen more convincing fake blood at Ben Franklin for 59 cents) -- Judd's successful request for parole -- her success in tracking down all of these people (she should start her own Missing Persons Bureau) -- oh yeah, Tommy Lee Jones was real good at finding people too -- do guns really keep on working after they've been submerged in salt water for a while?  Apparently they do -- it's a good thing, too, because it sure came in handy inside that coffin!

It was quite snappy and witty and well-written in spots, and the strong woman thing was obviously a factor, but there's a difference between strong and bionic.There are too many rolling, crashing cars in this movie but the worst comes when Libby (Judd) is handcuffed to Layman's (Jones') car and decides to break away, and they end up in the ocean.  Keeping in mind she is HANDCUFFED to a sinking car, Layman unlocks her, she manages to grab his gun, they swim to the surface (air not being an issue for either one, and it IS actually quite a cool shot as they come up).  They rise to the surface barely gasping, she tries to swim away but he keeps grabbing her, a struggle ensues, she cracks him in the head with the gun THEN swims to oh my God, where did that beach come from? and instead of collapsing on the shore, RUNS into the forest.

In the touristy thriller Double Jeopardy, Nick Parsons (Bruce Greenwood) proves himself a wealthy art bore by browbeating a young man who mistakes Nick's Kandinsky for a Picasso. This is reason enough for Nick to meet a violent end. Photogenically, he happens to have bought a nice new sailboat for the occasion. Libby Parsons (Ashley Judd) wakes up to find blood all over the boat, Nick missing and a telltale gory knife lying on deck. She clutches the knife without benefit of gloves. This is enough to get Libby imprisoned for murder. And that setup is enough to send Double Jeopardy roaming from the coastline of Washington State to the French Quarter of New Orleans, once the third piece of the puzzle has fallen into place. Nick has been having an affair with Libby's sister (Annabeth Gish) and he has run off with Libby's son.  He merely faked being overboard and dead. Now Libby, who has managed to look princessy even while wearing a hairnet and stirring a vat of prison gruel, is out of the slammer and out for revenge. As directed by Bruce Beresford, the film moves mechanically through these early stages. It shows so little true momentum that lines like I feel like I've grown in the past six years are all that signify the passage of time, as opposed to change in the characters. But Ms. Judd is a so talented actress that you forget the context and you care only on her character, Libby. She transforms Libby as a mother and not as a victim. A mother who has the will to get her child back. Ms. Judd's work is beautiful  as an actress she is able to incarnate with finesse a mother. The first and the last scene are one of the exceptional example of her work. It is so rare than an actress could performe in a way that the audience will be moved by her  work and will consider the silly plots and the direction as a secondary background. It's a real miracle which is difficult to explain how with a so bad material an actress could save by her own talent and work, how she could give to a movie a character who will be a part of audience's mind during a long time. It's so rare that the filmcritic will probably not understand the reason of the success of the film - they will think about the marketing , or the similitude with Fugitive , or the beauty of Ms. Judd. But they will never understand the extraordinary result of her dainty performance as it is.The latter part of the film invokes Tommy Lee Jones as another weathered sourpuss with a knack for barking orders. A coed homage to The Fugitive is part of the desired effect.Of course the film has Ms. Judd driving demolition-derby-style, hurtling a car off a ferry, becoming a computer-smart  investigator and stealing an Armani evening gown which are written and directed so badly than you ask yourself how difficult it should have been for Ms. Judd to keep her character on track.Though the action revolves around Libby's legal right to whack the odious Nick (see title), the lawyers and investigators who might have sent Nick to prison are conveniently absent from the story. Jones' role, that of a law professor turned probation officer who (like Libby) is heartbroken over a lost child, seems to have been devised by a plot-o-matic machine. Jones continues to hone the fine art of the acid wisecrack, combining it with an attractively gruff, paternal side.

I fully understand the concept of suspension of disbelief, but too much of the plot here is simply unbelievable.

"},{"Title":"","Date":"26 September 1999","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Mystery, Thriller","Review":"  WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEADThe primary problem with `Double Jeopardy' is that the television trailers give the whole story away.  Based on TV commercials, we know there will be a standoff between Judd and Greenwood where she describes here freedom to shoot him since she already served her time for his murder!  Well, then why bother showing up for the first 90 minutes of the movie? The only suspense in the entire film is whether Jones will end up dead. ÔÇ∑ Judd wakes up covered with blood on a sailboat---we already know it has to be a set-up.ÔÇ∑ Judd's courtroom trial begins---we already know she's going to jail. ÔÇ∑ Judd is trapped in a coffin---we know she'll escape because the over-advertised `shoot you in the middle of Mardi Gras' line hasn't happened yet.A second interesting problem is that the movie left the distinct impression that a fugitive that has been wrongfully accused of a crime (where have I seen that plot line?) who also happens to be an attractive women should steer clear of other women (unless they're in prison). Instead, focus on the men, who will bend over backwards to help.  Here is a short list of the women in this film who were antagonists to Judd. These include the nanny (extramarital relationship with Judd's husband, stealing her child), the lawyer (the `aliens did it' monologue), the head-mistress (not divulging her child's whereabouts), the receptionist in the hotel (wouldn't provide information on Greenwood's schedule), and the gift-shop clerk (not offering to help and then questioning Judd's dress size).  At the other extreme are the men in the movie.  This list includes Jones (basically risks everything because he believes Judd), the French Quarter bartender (who provides Judd an escape while holding the `WANTED' posting in his hands), the library Internet guy (who teaches her how to search on-line while hitting on her), and the BMW salesman (who run's a credit report based on a stolen SSN and name).Unfortunately, the complete lack of suspenseful situations coupled with many unrealistic plot twists (couldn't a women of Judd's means afford a better lawyer?) left me feeling that the $5 matinee price was still too much.All in all, a disappointing movie for all involved.

But the movie feels like a typical Hollywood studio movie circa 1999 written and re-written by committee, re-shot to death, scenes added solely for their look or action content and others deleted because they make it impossible to play the movie in theaters five times a day.Personally, I would also like to know why the studios continue to promote their thrillers with the punch line and the payoff shot in the trailer?  If you have caught the television trailer for this movie (and anyone who has watched 30 minutes of TV in the last two weeks has) you know that Judd is set up for a murder she did not commit, that her husband is actually not dead, and that in the end she blows him away!  It would be OK if the movie was clever enough to keep you riveted through its running time wondering just how she's going to do it, but this movie is so-but-oh-so predictable, the whole enterprise of seeing it seems pointless.  One more question does this movie represent the creme-de-la-creme of the scripts Ashley Judd is getting, or did the movie she originally signed on to make never see the light of day?  I would like to believe the latter, because Judd is too talented a young actress to be settling for this level of script or movie.  Had Double Jeopardy had the script it deserved, Judd might have pulled a star turn of the same caliber as the great star turns of all time.  But star turns do not happen out of context and on the basis of star charisma alone.  They need a substantial film around them to be memorable, and substantial this movie ain't.Teach the Hollywood suits behind this waste of time a lesson and don't waste your money on it!

Her husband is nowhere to be found and in short order she is convicted of murdering him and pushing him overboard.  We know she is innocent, but this is not a courtroom story.  After the conviction she has her best friend take care of her son and they soon vanish.

If you're a junkie for that kind of thing, bring your bowl of ice cream to the theater and enjoy yourself.The rest of us will be scratching our heads, wondering why there are so many holes the story.  The biggest goof happens when our hero discovers while in prison that her best friend and son have vanished.  She learns of solid evidence that could get her out of prison in a hurry, but never calls anyone for help.What gives?

Tommy Lee Jones played the same character he has played in every movie.Although this movie had great potential, the script was not written well.  You know that Judd's character is convicted of murder, but not what degree of murder.  This leads to the question of how a convicted murderer gets parole in just 6 years.   There is a point where Libby (Judd's Character) learns that her husband (whom she was convicted of killing) is still alive.  Rather than trying to prove he is alive and prove her innocence, Libby gets herself in shape so she can track him when she gets out.  In order to get out, she admits she killed him and throws herself on the mercy of the parole board.  I can't help wondering if these are really the actions that a woman would take in this situation (especially a woman with an affluent background).Double Jeopardy had a lot of potential.

Basically Elizabeth 'Libby' Parsons (Bug's Ashley Judd) is happily married to Nicholas 'Nick' (Swept Away's Bruce Greenwood) and has wonderful son Matty (Age 4, Benjamin Weir), and then after spending the night on their boat, Libby wakes to find Nick gone, blood all over the place, and a knife covered in it. After an investigation and trial, it is discovered that Nick had a two million dollar insurance policy, and she was in financial trouble, so they charge her for murder and believe she killed him for the money. In prison Libby allows her friend Angela 'Angie' Green (Annabeth Gish) to adopt Matty, and during a phone call to him, she hears him call to his daddy, Nick is alive and has set her up! She also learns that because she's already charged with a murder she cannot be convicted for the same crime (or victim) twice, this is known as double jeopardy, so she keeps this in mind that she can kill Nick and there is nothing the law can do. After giving a compelling statement to the prison officials to apply for parole, Libby is put in the custody of parole officer, and former lawyer, Travis Lehman (Tommy Lee Jones), who knows himself what it is like to lose a child. As she is on parole she has a certain set of rules to follow from Travis in terms of curfew, but she ignores all of this and when she can tries to find a way to trace Angie or her son. After she is caught breaking into Angie's school to get her record she is to be taken somewhere more secure with Travis, but she manages to escape when she causes an incident on the boat they are travelling. While Travis is trying to track Libby down, she has found out that Angie died, but she traces the routes through some art work, and eventually she tracks down Nick, under the new name of Jonathan Devereaux. Instead of planning to kill him she confronts him at an auction evening, and she demands to have her son back, and he agrees to meet her in a cemetery, but just when she thinks she has found Matty again he has hired a fake kid and knocks her out. Libby manages to escape her coffin in the mausoleum, and even though Travis catches her going back for Nick, he is now convinced, having followed her movements, that she is telling the truth about her innocence. In the end Travis and Libby confront Nick about his crimes, and after demands and blackmail he does tell them where Matty is, but it turns into a violent fight and he ends up shot, with Travis wounded as well, but Libby does finally get Matty (Age 11, Spencer Treat Clark) back. Also starring Jay Brazeau as Bobby Long, John Maclaren as Rudy, Edward Evanko as Warren and Bruce Campbell as Bartender at Party. Judd gives a believable and compelling performance as the mother put through a nightmare and wanting revenge and her son back, Jones gets his moments as the parole officer chasing her and eventually swaying to her side, and Greenwood is rather a nasty villain as the cheating husband that fakes his death. I read that this was a big hit in America, and no wonder, it is a little bit of a preposterous idea, but at the same time you can go along with it and have a great time, it is full of exciting and entertaining, a most watchable action thriller.

Even though he always plays the same roles, he's just really good in those roles.However, he is not the only reason why I love this film as much as I do. You can't forget the leading lady. Who, is also the main focus and star of the entire film. Ashley Judd. From beginning to end, you feel in some small part that you are her, and that the things she is going through, you are going through with her.How would you feel if after a romantic night on a boat, out in the middle of the ocean, you woke up to blood all over you, the boat and there is no trace of your husband. You'd be pretty scared, right? And you would certainly never suspect that you'd be going to prison for murdering him, would you? Well, this is the set up towards the beginning of the film and what proceeds, is sheer excitement, and fear.Certainly not just a one time watch, and there is some humor in it if you like a thriller with a little bit of a humorous attitude to it.Ashley Judd kicks my socks off the couch in this movie, and I recommend it to everyone!

It's the kind of the movie, I'm normally into, so I expected to like it, but not as much as I did. There's a great screen-play here and the movie is just very exciting.Ashley Judd stars in the movie, she plays Libby, a happily married woman, who has a son, Matty, and just a very good life-style. Until, one day, she and her husband, Nick, are on a romantic trip on a boat, (Matty is staying with Angie, a 'friend' of Libby and Nicks.) when in the night, whilst Libby is asleep, Nick has supposedly been killed, or so she thinks. As when Libby wakes up, she sees blood all over her and the boat. She walks into the kitchen and then outside the boat, when she picks up a knife from the floor, the police come.  The story continues, when the police think Libby has killed Nick. They also can't find Nicks body. Now, even though she obviously didn't kill Nick, she can't convince the court that and is sent to prison. She tells her friend Angie, to adopt Matty. Angie agrees. For a while, Angie and Matty come to visit her in prison, until after a while they stop coming to visit. Libby knows something is up and when she finds out that Angie has moved, she gets her phone number and when she calls Angie up, she realises that Nick, her 'dead husband' is still alive and in the house with Angie and Matty. Angie and Nick are obviously together. (The thing was, this movie had the type of screen-play, which even though was great, I knew straight away, that Nicks death was planned and that Angie and Nick, would be together and in on the plan, etc.)Now, a friend Libby meets in prison tells her that if she tells the court again, that she did murder her husband, Nick and that she's a changed woman, etc, they probably will end up letting her go. They do. So, after six years, innocent Libby is free. She's on parol though and has to stay in a special house for a couple of years, until she's allowed to live on her own. This house is looked after by, parol officer, Travis played by Tommy Lee Jones, who ends up Libby after a while.   Seeing as Libby is free woman, she plans to get her son back, on the way, she finds out that Angie has supposedly died, in a gas leak in her home. It's obvious to Libby, that Nick really killed her. Anyway, It's quite hard for Libby, to find Nick and Matty as Nick keeps changing his name, all the time. She ends up finding Nick though and ends up killing him, but not in the Double Jeopardy way. And, of course she gets Matty back, which is basically what happens at the end of the movie. Oh, and she becomes good friends with her parol officer, Travis.Ashley Judd and Tommy Lee Jones are both great here and were perfectly cast in there roles. (Judd was a tiny bit unconvincing though at the beginning, when she crying.) Double Jeopardy is a movie for everyone and I give it a 10/10, so see it now. "},{"Title":"Kill him twice.

The basic premise is flawed.  Even if the double jeopardy law allowed Libby (Ashley Judd) to kill her husband without penalty after serving her time (which it doesn't), she would still go back to jail for parole violations (possession of a weapon among other things).  The plot line is threadbare from overuse.  This is a cross between `The Fugitive' and `The Pelican Brief';  innocent girl chasing after the bad guy while everyone is chasing after her.This film asks the viewer to leap chasm after chasm of incredulity.  Let's examine some of the malarkey they ask us to swallow.  Do they expect us to believe that Libby wakes up covered with blood, sees a knife on the deck and doesn't expect foul play?  Is there anyone on the planet stupid enough to pick up the knife and make themselves the prime murder suspect?  When she's in jail and suspects that her husband is alive, why isn't she calling her lawyer, the prosecutor, the press and anyone else she knows who could hire a private investigator to find him?  When Travis (Tommy Lee Jones) caught her, are we really supposed to believe that he would leave his keys in the car with her inside?  And after she crashed four times into other cars and knocked one off the back of the ferry, no one noticed?  And my favorite; why didn't Nick (Bruce Greenwood) strangle her before stuffing her in the coffin with her knapsack with the gun in it?  Even if he had forgotten that Travis told him that Libby had a gun, don't tell me he couldn't feel the weight of a handgun in the knapsack.Tommy Lee Jones was out of gas in this film.  Between `The Fugitive', `US Marshals', and this, he has played the same character in the same situation so many times in succession that he has grown flaccid from boredom. Ashley Judd was actually excellent, and was the only reason to see the film.  Her athleticism as well as her intensity impressed me.  It is seldom that you will see a female actress agree to do her own stunts, especially one that involves escaping from a submerged vehicle.Acclaimed director Bruce Beresford proves that a big budget, bankable stars and talented filming cannot save a trashy script.  The filming of this movie was technically excellent, containing good suspense, thrilling stunt work, great chase scenes and plenty of plot twists.  But Beresford must have decided that all the plot holes didn't matter, since he didn't demand rewrites.  So I place the blame for this tripe squarely in his lap.I think I was being generous in rating this film a 5/10.  Anyone who rents it on video needs to check their brain at the door if they hope to enjoy the ride.

First came U.S. Marshals, in 1998, which, like The Fugitive, detailed an innocently convicted man tracking down his enemies and starred Tommy Lee Jones. Now there's Double Jeopardy, which contains a plot so close to the other two, its a shame the filmmakers had to go and break tradition with generating this film an R-rating. Neither of the other two films were this coarse, and that's the only thing keeping Double Jeopardy, on its own level of comparison.The movie opens by introducing the happily married couple Nick and Libby Parsons, who seemingly has it all; a wealthy living style, a well-behaved nine year old son named Bobby, a strong matrimony, and even a great big sail boat that Nick recently borrowed for Libby and is ready to purchase for her. In the heat of the decision, the two of them arrange a baby-sitter, long time friend Angie, to watch Bobby for the night while they have the time of their life exploring the waters nearby.Everything looks wonderful from the sailboat. The waters calm and the sky clear. Libby and Nick go under deck when night falls. The two of them relax, make love, and then go to bed. When Libby wakes up hours afterwards, the entire sailboat is covered with blood, showing signs of a struggle. The boat is deserted, with her being the one on board. Where's Nick? What happened?Libby will have plenty time to think about these things when she is accused of murdering her husband with a knife. She is wrongly convicted and sentenced to prison, where she learns that her husband is off living another life with Angie and Bobby, and the two million dollars in insurance money. She then learns of the concept of double jeopardy, from a jail mate. It is the fifteenth amendment on the constitution. The prisoner explains to Libby that the state already said that she killed her husband, so if she gets out of prison, and actually kills him, regardless of how many witnesses or the evidence, she can't be charged twice with the same crime. This is exactly what Libby intends to do.Double Jeopardy has a perfect setup in the structure and story. The first act is pretty solid and confident. The scenes relate to each other and are well constructed.  The external problem is the seemingly murderous act against her husband. The internal problem has to do with her missing son. Proper complications follow the conflict, such as Libby's prison sentence, the discovery of her husbands secret plans, her parole officer (Tommy Lee Jones) and his strict rules which are broken, her escape, all that build up to a rather predictable, but admirable, conclusion.The film runs into trouble in the second act. The story turns from skillful setup to scene after scene of Libby and her parole officer, Lehman, chasing each other. The Fugitive got away with that, and I am not necessarily saying that Double Jeopardy is a total failure in its chase sequences. The scenes are well made and somewhat exciting. But it is a shame to see such a wonderful first act lead to such a conventional story line.The are many good qualities and bad qualities about Bruce Beresford's suspense thriller. The take off in the second act is full of excitement and high energy. The sailboat scene, where Libby awakens to a bloody mess in the middle of the night with her husband missing, is really suspenseful--but there is no momentum build up. The trials in which Libby is charged with are one sided, making perfectly clear that the film is going somewhere unexpected. The scene where Libby learns of her husband's secret life on the phone in prison is a golden moment, as is the slammer atmosphere altogether. There is a nice production design involved with the film as well. But what about the $10,000 Libby spends on clothes as she confronts Nick for the first time in years? That is the question I kept asking myself throughout the third act.The performing talents existing in Double Jeopardy only prove what a shame it is that the characters aren't better understood or developed. Tommy Lee Jones doesn't get to do much here except chase Libby. Not to mention the fact that his character is developed through situations, rumors, dialogue and personality clashes, never being introduced to us appropriately. This is not a major catastrophe, and to some extent, under the circumstances, kind of effective--but his performance is never anything he is capable of producing with a better developed script.Ashley Judd's performance and character is a different story. Her character is entirely realized and empathized with. From her motives to the increasingly dramatic situations she is faced with, all offer profoundness and realism. One big problem, however, is the intelligence  of her character, which seems to vary from scene to scene. For example, in one incident she might be so cleaver and tricky that her keen senses can associate troubles nearby. While in others, she is prone to walk right into an obvious trap. The key in developing profound characters is keeping them profound throughout the entire production,  and the way to do that is consistency.Even if Double Jeopardy wasn't a virtual clone of The Fugitive, however, it would probably have failed still. You see, the movie's individual scenes seem fragmented and scattered.  Like Stigmata, the production has a hard time fitting together in order to make a good overall piece of work. So, no, even if you haven't seen or heard about The Fugitive or U.S. Marshals, this film still isn't worth seeing. Sorry--a close call in my case, but no recommendation here.Brought to you by Paramount Pictures.

One night on board they're yacht after a night of passion, he seemingly falls overboard after a violent struggle and leaves an incriminating 911 call.Who else could it incriminate but Judd and she's tried and convicted of her husband's murder. Her best friend Annabeth Gish adopts her son, but then Judd discovers that Gish has moved out of their Seattle area and then she inadvertently finds out that her husband is still alive. It takes six years, but she's granted a parole, but she's not about to wait in a halfway house. She's busts her parole and goes on the hunt with her parole officer Tommy Lee Jones on her trail.Her legal advice comes from Jones, a former law professor and Roma Maffia a disbarred attorney she meets in the joint. If these two had been her attorneys she might have been acquitted. Maffia especially gives a memorable performance in a very small role.Double Jeopardy has a number of flaws in it. Firstly if I had been Bruce Greenwood I sure would have fled the country with my ill gotten gains and not lived so public a lifestyle as he does. Could not wrap my head around his recklessness. Also Judd specifically does not want her son to go to her mother because they didn't get along. Yet it's mom played by Anna Hagan comes through in the end for her with quite a roll of bills to help her in her pursuit of Greenwood. And the whole concept of what Double Jeopardy means is open to question. I recall a Law And Order episode where someone was killed by a person who had committed a crime for which they had not done the deed and most emphatically that did not grant him the newly freed perpetrator a murder on the state.It's unfortunate because I think Double Jeopardy had a role lot of potential that was wasted.

In fairness, it was written by the team behind The Rock and produced by Aaron Spelling's ex-partner Leonard Goldberg, which would explain a lot.Even without that knowledge, you still have the fact that this is the kind of film that works best if you don't know much going in. Alas, a lot of the preview information did reveal enough to give you a basic idea - Ashley Judd, the Jeff Bridges to Wynonna's Beau (that is, as one UK critic said the talented, slim and attractive one), is convicted for murdering her hubby on circumstantial evidence, finds out that he's alive, is told by a fellow inmate and disbarred lawyer that she can find him, kill him and escape scott-free under the concept of double jeopardy (I'm no expert on the American legal system, but I'm sure it can't be that simple. And as another person here noted, taking legal advice from a convicted murderer isn't a good idea), and eventually gets out of prison on parole with the goal of finding her husband and getting her beloved son back. That means that the rest of the film is a bit predictable, but it doesn't mean that Miss Judd, unlike the ever-professional Tommy Lee Jones, has to let her obvious (though not unreasonable) disdain for the script shine through a bit too often; nor does it has to be increasingly ludicrous (sample plothole how does a parole violator manage to get from Washington State to New Orleans so easily?). Another problem for British viewers is the name of Bruce Greenwood's character - it's hard for Brits to take seriously a thriller where the heavy is called Nicholas Parsons (though in fairness, I wouldn't expect Americans to know he shares his name with a veteran UK game-show host). Not that it would have been easier to take seriously if he had another name, mind.At least Judd and Jones don't become a couple, and it does keep the attention (she certainly makes a more sympathetic heroine than, say, Demi Moore), but in the end you wish it had had more suspense and a bit less silliness. Although that said, compared to the last movie in which Tommy Lee Jones pursued an innocent fugitive (U.S. Marshals), this is pure Les Miserables, even if Victor Hugo's protagonist doesn't have a bottom as nice as Ashley Judd's.

She learns that she can't be tried for his murder since she already has been, and begins to plan his death and how to get her husband back.Despite that fact that the whole film is summed up in the title I decided to watch it anyway. So really there is very little drama for much of the film as we all know what she's doing and where the film is going. The plot could have been lifted from any number of video thrillers - all it needed was a little nudity and it could have been an erotic thriller for late night TV! As it stood, the bigger budget, higher production values and bigger stars helped the film actually rise a little above the material and seem to be much glossier and impressive than it actually was. The stunts and effects worked well and the direction was of a higher calibre than you'd see on the bottom shelf, but it is still a very ordinary thriller if you strip all the polish away.The cast try hard but they have little to work with. An unnecessary role from Tommy Lee Jones helps keep the film's pace up by turning it into a cat and mouse chase of sorts, but mostly it is pretty dull. Judd is OK in the lead but doesn't do anything to justify her fee I reckon. Support from Mafia is so lame that it looks like she is almost falling asleep while giving her lines! The film relies on pace and tension which it mostly gets by flipping cars around for little reason and for putting Elizabeth in slightly (!) unlikely situations then getting her out of them. The legal interest in the plot actually falls to pieces when you think about it, but the film is clever enough never to take it's central idea further than a few lines of dialogue before rendering the argument null and void.Overall I was struck by just how ordinary and dull the whole film was. If I had seen this film as a low budget video thriller I still wouldn't have liked it but I may have accepted it for what it is. This film just exposed it's own weaknesses by virtue of pushing to be a product much grander than it's plot deserved.

A friend of mine who knows something about legal theory (I know next to nothing) points out that one can nevertheless face the same CHARGE twice.  If I am convicted of stealing Fred's car it's just not true that the law can't touch me if I steal his car a second time - in the eyes of the law, which is not a complete ass, I have committed TWO crimes, even though they both bear the same description `stealing Fred's car'.Let us suppose, though, that it's different in the case of murder, at least in some jurisdiction somewhere.  (It's easy to see why murder might be a special case.)  Suppose that Libby Parsons, falsely convicted of killing Nick Parsons, now has the legal right to REALLY kill him.  What of it?  Murder is the ONLY crime Libby is at legal liberty to commit; but how does one commit ONLY murder? It's just not possible.  In order to murder Mick, Libby must break any number of other laws she must inflict grievous bodily harm, or damage property, or endanger someone's safety, or carry a concealed firearm, or create a public nuisance, or loiter, or jaywalk - I'm sure there are enough laws on the books to keep her locked away from precisely as long as if she'd simply been convicted of murder a second time, and a good thing too.It's hard not to think of this when she JUMPS PAROLE in order to go in search of her presumed-dead husband.  What's the point of this detail?  The film wants to wave what it supposes to be a clever gimmick in our faces the fact that Libby can commit murder within the law.  If she then breaks a law - which she needn't have done, and which the film certainly needn't have been constructed so as to make it the case that she needed to have done - what's the POINT of the double jeopardy routine?  I don't know that there was much point anyway.  Do we really want this woman to break out of jail and murder her husband?  Of course not.  We like her.  She's not yet a killer and we don't want her to become one, even if killing her husband is in her interest, which it isn't.  This would have been a better film if Beresford had at some point halfway through made it clear to us that the legal principle Libby had heard from her friend in jail was but a distortion of the truth.Anyway this bugged me.  But it's not to say that Double Jeopardy isn't otherwise a well-made thriller, distinctly enjoyable to watch.  It has Tommy Lee Jones doing his schtick, for one thing.  I actually prefer his character here to the one he bore in The Fugitive.  Everyone remembers his reply in the earlier film to I didn't kill my wife I don't care.

If she killed her husband, the double jeopardy clause wouldn't protect her because it would prove that she hadn't killed him before, thus making the previous conviction null and void, or she'd be tried for killing someone OTHER than her husband, if it couldn't be proved it was indeed him she'd killed. Plus, since she would have killed him on a different date, time and possibly way than the first time, it would be counted as a different crime anyway.Basically, these thoughts kept ricocheting around my mind as I watched this movie, totally destroying any possibility of enjoying the film. If you're going to make a movie like this, get someone that can at least open a law book to consult the screenwriter. Maybe then they could make a script that didn't talk down to me and insult my intelligence.I give this movie 4 out of 10 stars, the only saving graces being the acting and editing. I really can't recommend this film just on the sheer incompetence of the script.

One night she finds her husband dead and she is the suspect. When she is found to be guilty she gives her child to her best friend and it turns out that a couple of months later they've disappeared off the map and when she tracks them she finds out that her husband was alive the whole time. She then finds out from a prison friend that she can kill her husband again and she can't be convicted for it or in any way legally harm her (Um... I'm not American but I'm going to call bullshit on this one).Once she goes on parole six years after she started doing her time, she then decides to set out and find her son by any means necessary, even by abusing her parole. Through this her Parole officer runs across the country to find her and stop her (Wasn't this almost exactly Tommy Lee Jones' role in The Fugitive too?).I think some of the acting was pretty... Well it was kind of on and off. I'm not just talking about how some performances were good while others were bad (although some of the supporting players do a consistently okay job) I mean with people like Ashley Judd. I mean at some points she did a convincing job while other times... you could tell she was reading from a script. Although to be fair I might consider this bad directing/editing than I would bad acting if they were okay with using some of these takes.And the writing does get a little weak in places. For example Libby's sole defense for not killing her husband is You have to believe me, and as I said I'm pretty sure the loophole that she could kill her husband for real and there will be no legal repercussions is a really dumb plot point and there's a scene where she pretends to be her friend who adopted her son to buy a car (or learn her social security number) and a scene later we find out this friend died a few years earlier in the story... How come the Car Salesman didn't call out on the fact that she's using a dead woman's social security? It would have been better if that was revealed then.Okay now based on those complaints I think I should say what I liked. I actually think the cinematography is okay. The chase scenes are well directed and the premise is actually interesting enough to get me through the story and as I said some of the acting from people like Tommy Lee Jones is actually quite good.So I guess if you like something that isn't that smart yet has an interesting premise, good acting and good chase scenes then I would certainly recommend this movie. If you are looking for something else then I haven't really seen another movie like this (not even The Fugitive) so I can't really pass a recommendation there so as I said if you're looking for a movie that has a good premise even if some of the writing is weak then this is for you.

I must compliment the choice of actors that was chosen.

Double Jeopardy gets interesting when her son answers the phone and inadvertently calls out daddy. Libby becomes steamed and begins her search for her dead husband.The first half of this film was interesting and enjoyable; however, it deteriorated to another version of The Fugitive. The scene I enjoyed the most in this film was the reaction Nick gave Libby when she finally located him. This particular scene is what made Double Jeopardy definitely worth seeing.I thought that Judd's performance was overplayed because it tended to be focused more on the fact that she was betrayed by Nick.Although, Tommy Lee Jones was excellent in the role of Travis Lehman, I question his choice of scripts. I hate to see an actor with the caliber of Jones pick a role that has been done; much less a role the same actor did in a previous film only under the the guise of different title.The director of Double Jeopardy, Bruce Beresford deserves credit for changing the stereotypical roles of cop and villain.

This irritating thriller relies on the characters being completely brain-dead, and the audience too. A few points of idiocy (SPOILERS)  1) Ashley doesn't bother to consult any lawyers about her husband being alive, altho we see her on the phone with the insurance agency! The first people you'd call, right? The advice she follows is to take several more years out of her life before seeing her kid!2) I'm not a lawyer like at least 2 characters in this film claim to be, but I've seen enough law shows on TV to realize that this interpretation of double jeopardy is complete B. S. The term applies to being found innocent of a specific charge, not to convictions that may be overturned or separate incidents. Ashley should have asked herself why her legal advisor lives behind bars.3) Speaking of people doing the exact opposite of what sane humans would do scumbag hubby, who won't stop at murder, has her alone at his mercy unconcscious, unknown to anyone, so he kills her, right? Of course not--that would solve his problem! Instead he pulls some bizarre tedious garbage with a coffin, like he's in a parody of an old serial, and conveniently includes her bag of tricks so she can escape. It did him no good that she was so dumb as to fall for this pathetic ruse in the first place. 4) After the foregoing, this point is almost too minor to be mentioned. Tommy Lee somehow is conversant with her whole husband alive story and that she supposedly intends to kill him, altho we never see them have any such conversation, nor does it seem likely that they would. She would tell her parole officer that she's just trying to locate her son but not the crazy story about the husband after she admitted her guilt to get parole.I had to get this off my chest b/c the movie is just insulting.

That's my opinion, because that's how I felt. I understand why so many critics despised it and why so many moviegoers watched it and it became the biggest box office hit on North America spring, before the release of Oscar contenders. It has everything the critics hate plot holes, clich√©s, factual mistakes, situations that would never happen in real life. And it has everything the big audiences like superficial, harmless entertainment. But anyway it is entertainment. You may be thinking that I liked it very much because I was entertained, but I'm giving it a C+ and 59 out of 100, because this is not a great film by any stretch of thought, but also not an awful one. I would never praise and recommend it highly, but I wouldn't feel bad if I had to watch it again.Almost every good action scenes and some plot twists were already revealed by the trailer, so I'm not spoiling when I resume the plot. Libby and Nick are a wealthy couple who live a perfect life with their child. However, this happiness is over after a night when Libby wakes up at their boat and finds blood everywhere and a knife, which she picks up (DUH!), but doesn't find her husband. After some investigations, she is blamed by his death (and of course we know she is innocent). She goes to prison, leaving her son with a friend, Angela. One day, Angela stops visiting her and she starts to search for her. She is living in another city and while his son is talking to her guess who arrives... Nick. The child mentions his name and Libby hears. Now she has a strong feeling of hate. One of the women on prison, who was once a lawyer, explains to her about double jeopardy. According to the lady, a person can't be considered guilty for the same crime twice. So Libby can kill her husband on Times Square and she won't go to prison again. Is that so easy like that???????? I guess not, but after six years Libby leaves the prison and is now by the responsibility of a state worker, Travis Lehman, whose job is to take female prisoners back to an ordinary life. But Libby won't give up of her revenging plan.With a story like that, DOUBLE JEOPARDY couldn't have been much better, but some situations could have been more difficult to happen. Libby does everything she plans. She travels by plane, finds Angela's new address, buys an expensive dress at a hotel store, saying that she is one of the hotel guests. And the cops never catch her. Situations like that are almost laughable. There is one that is the worst of the whole movie Nick throws a thing at Libby's head and puts her into a coffin. When she wakes up, there is a body by her side, but (as a superhero) she can get out of the coffin just using her gun. Smart girl, uh? However, the biggest implausibility is about the double jeopardy law. I don't know almost anything about the Brazilian Penal Code, so what would I say about the American? But killing a person and be considered not guilty in a blink of eyes is just impossible. I can say the same about Nick's situation, who pretends that he is dead, changes his name a dozen of times and goes on with his life cheating everyone. I think that the writers should have studied these two situations deeper before writing a screenplay for a Hollywood film. American lawyers may have been even ashamed of this.The people who praised Ashley Judd's performance should also reconsider that. She is not awful, but has got much to learn. She was awful in her first films (HEAT, A TIME TO KILL), pretty bad in KISS THE GIRLS, quite better here. I can't say the same about Tommy Lee Jones, who has a good chemistry with Judd, even if they don't have an affair. Director Bruce Beresford does what he can. This is certainly much, much better than his last suspense effort SILENT FALL, a muddled and almost unwatchable so-called mystery.The superficiality, the plot holes, the cliched, unbelievable and laughable situations, the sentimental ending and the trailer which showed everything that could have been considered as a plot twist make this film awful, right? No, just because it is fun to watch and never boring, a thing that doesn't happen in GONE IN 60 SECONDS, which is everything I said and also not fun and monotonous. I barely recommend DOUBLE JEOPARDY. It represents everything I like and hate about movies (attention! Movies, not films). It's better than I thought, but Hollywood should start to worry about factual errors in screenplays.

It's a case of Hollywood telling us who is good and who is a star without controlling quality.First of all, the film is a waste of time.  If you've seen the trailer, or even read the video box, you know the plot.  She already did her time for killing her husband, so she can't be convicted again...  Legally, she could serve more time, and that fact was verified before the movie even came out.  You know how it'll turn out, and it's not even fun to watch the ins and outs up until that inevitable point.  It's entertaining if you just like to see characters do action-like things on screen, but there's no meat to it.  Please, just turn the TV off and read a book instead.  You'll like it more.Second, the movie is unbelievable.  My friends say oh, you have to suspend disbelief, which I can do for something like Star Wars or Ninth Gate, but there's just too much to ignore here.  I don't want to post spoilers, but I'm going to border on it, just to show anyone who hasn't seen this why it's unbelievable and why they should see something else.  Ashley Judd gets out on parole, so technically she can serve the rest of her time if she kills her husband again.  Parolees can't cross state lines.  Parolees can't carry a weapon.  Parolees in this film have to be back in Tommy Lee Jones's boarding house  by a certain time or they go back to jail.  Ashley Judd breaks all those rules yet no one seems to notice those obvious flaws.  She pays for a plane ticket with cash too, which I thought was pretty funny.Thirdly, the acting was embarrassing.  Ashley Judd doesn't change facial expressions throughout the movie.  She's determined to kill her husband no matter how illegal, illogical and just plain unrealistic it is.  Tommy Lee Jones has done so many other great films but it looks like he's just going through the motions and he looks weary of the plot.  The hard nosed parole officer suddenly gets a heart of gold and wants to see a man killed?  That don't add up.So this film is the Emperor's New Clothes.  Everyone will rave about it but they're raving about something with no substance.  Frustrating and unbelievable, uninspired and overpraised, Double Jeopardy is a bad movie caught up in the Hollywood press machine.  You'll like this if you enjoyed Boys and Girls or any other movie Hollywood likes to force down our throats with big stars and not much else to them.

While there she learns that her husband is not dead, and when she is paroled six years later she goes on a hunt to find her son. The Movie's title comes from the often bandied about Double Jeopardy law, which states that you cannot be tried for the same crime twice. Thankfully everyone in this movies seems to have a legal degree, so the point of the movie is driven home over and over.Judd does a fine job in her role, and is convincing even though there is very little character development. Greenwood is also very good but gets very little screen time. Jones is the big mystery -- he's an accomplished actor who, I must admit, blew me away in The Fugitive, but in this film he does little more than reprise his role as Sam Gerard only with far less gusto.The many plot holes were what destroyed this movie for me. We were breezed through Libby's trial and prison stay. Matty apparently never bothered to find out more about his mother, and seemed unsurprised to be united with her again at the end of the film. Further, everyone, including the boy and the New Orleans police, seemed to be delighted by the fact that a convicted murderer was finally able to kill the wealthy, respectable socialite.Overall, this movie is better than watching paint peel.

Thats it it simply makes up the cinema numbers. What shall we watch if that Sixth Sense movie is sold out? We'll watch that Jeopardy movie, the trailer looked good.The formula is so simple and being that the whole plot was given away in the trailer there was no surprises, twists or plotting which would come as a surprise. The film itself was structured with 10 minute flashes of action which takes us from one place to the next. Beginning, demise, prison, then so on and so forth. There is no flow or equilibirity to the telling of the story.Ashley Judd is given the lead role in an industry where women are continually complaining about equality, and then no soonerhave we settled down to watch this womens plight then they introduce a male lead who takes up the pro-ceeding action. Less of a double act and more of a two pronged attack, the predictable plot and dialogue begin to annoy you as you second guess whats about to happen. More often than not we are correct with what is going to happen.When you begin thinking about the film in your head rather than thinking about the film on the screen it means that attention is lost.There are a few moments of cleverness, in Jeopardy but the fact is there is no indivuality to the piece. Cardboard characters and set pieces, which almost anyone can imitate are all that we are shown and maybe a revenge movie with a lead female charcter would have been a better end result.

The film, although somewhat enjoyable was weak from start to finish.Ashley Judd, exceptional as always, and a surprising performance by Bruce Greenwood as the husband/ bad guy, saved this from being a total flop (don't you just love to hate the bad guys!).The story line moves along at lightening speed during the first 20 minutes... wham, bam, thank you ma'm, she's tried, in jail... then out... all covering six years! No explanation of evidence, sentencing or details of her life in jail. Once out on the street... the character does everything possible to try and return to jail! But in the end justice prevails and she's let off scot-free (no charges for wrecking cars of assaulting parole officers).This is a film that would have benefited greatly by an additional 30 minutes. Most times, directors include too much film and lose their audience in overdrawn scenes and plot lines. But this one could have used some in-depth character development and scenes in jail to show this woman's right to be so bitter and seek revenge.I would not recommend spending the $8 at the theater on this race to the finish. Wait for the video release and hopefully the director's cut with the additional 30 minutes of needed story lines.  I give it a 6 out of 10.

But no, the film went ahead, and unfortunately (fortunately for all involved, however), Double Jeopardy was released during that time of year when studios dump their unsalvagable projects, and this film managed to be one of the pieces of flotsam that floated to the top.If you've seen the trailer or the TV ad for the film, rest assured that you know the entire plot.  I was hoping against hope that the film would be a little more engaging, somewhat more endearing, and much more action packed than the commercial, but I was disappointed on all counts.  And because of the plot-revealing ads, all traces of suspense are swiftly bled away, leaving you to play connect the scene until you've seen the last scene (and yes, it is the one with Judd aiming a gun at her husband).  The film traipses along without rhyme and less reason, hoping to distract you from the glaring plot holes by adding periodic kindling to your rage for revenge and giving Tommy Lee Jones wisecrack lines to deliver in his patented deadpan.I can't even begin to ennumerate the volumes of non sequiturs, plot inconsistancies, sketchy leaps of logic, and loose ends scattered about this film.  Ashley Judd wakes up on a boat covered in blood. Fine.  How do the authorities know it is the blood of the husband she purports to have murdered?  Weare not told, though such a procedure is mandatory.  Yet the film demands that you assume the forensics team overlooked that detail The prosecution offers as evidence a tape of a distress call allegedly made by said husband, I've been stabbed. But if she was really stabbing him would she allow him time to make the call?  Shouldn't we hear her somewhere in the background trying to finish the job?  Of course not.  And so on and so on, ad absurdum. In its attempt to raise your miscarriage of justice dudgeon, the film makes the trial, and all subsequent injustices, howlingly and vapidly ludicrous. Even the bad guy, played unconvincingly by Bruce Greenwood, can't even take a lesson from past movie villains.  His inexplicable relapse into the Auric Goldfinger school of I-am-going-to-put-you-in-my- machine-of-death-and-leave-you-to-die-Mr. Bond is inexcusable.  Why do bad guys always leave the death of their foes up to fate?Judd tries hard, real hard, to be an emotional center and to give her quest the gravity it deserves. Unfortunately, the film won't give her time--it's too busy rushing her through the post-murder grieving, the trial, the jail time, and the parole in order to get the the real business of the plot the incredible (as in not credible) quest to track down her undead (meaning, of course, not really dead) husband.  Even turning off your brain doesn't work here the chases are banal, what remains of the suspense is tepid, and the only thing that really looks great is the not-so-subtle plug for Armani and Judd's dazzling entrance to a swank Nawlins shindig.But the logical fallacies don't end here.  Somehow, this flick has made a lot of money and has raised Judd's salary to something like $8 million. But coming from a film where a fat roll of twenty dollar bills appears fortuitously in a tomato garden, I suppose anything can happen. "},{"Title":"Double your pleasure? Double your fun?

The scene I enjoyed the most in this film was the reaction Nick gave Libby when she finally located him.

Normally they haven't got a cast with any known actors in it and then they call it a TV-movie, but this time they were able to get Ashley Judd and Tommy Lee Jones for their movie. Not that it helped the movie to get to a higher level. It's still incredibly predictable.It all starts with the perfect little family. Man, wife and one kid who all live together as happy as possible. They've got a beautiful house at the beach and are going to buy a sailing boat. Of course they first want to make a little trip with it to be sure. And than it all happens. They have a little party and get drunk. Later at night she wakes up, her husband is missing and she is covered with his blood. She finds a knife on the deck and picks it up. Of course the coast guard spots her exactly on the moment that she's got the knife in her hand. His body is never found but they do find out that he had a life insurance worth 2 million dollar. She is convicted of murdering him and has to go to jail. Because she is no longer able to take care of her son, she asks a friend to adopt him. After a few months she never sees him again... her friend has moved and didn't let her know where they are now. She finds out that her husband isn't dead, that he lives with her friend and her son in San Fransisco... She's furious now and wants her kid back and wants to take revenge on her husband... which is exactly what she will do the day she is free on parole. What follows is a catch-me-if-you-can game between her, her husband and her parole officer which is so predictable that you think you wrote everything yourself. Of course she finds him, kills her husband and is reunited with her kid who doesn't ask too many questions about the fact that his mommy came back from the death to rescue him out of the claws of his evil dad...My advice to every person that likes a good thriller only watch it when you are able to switch off your brain for a couple of hours. Otherwise you'll be annoyed by all the flaws in the script and the many sugar sweet moments. The only thing I liked was the funeral with the brass band in New Orleans, that was really cool to watch.

You'll probably keep watching to see what happens but what happens isn't much different than a hastily shot television drama. Ashley Judd is excellent if not transcendent here as the leading character, and she plays a variety of kinds of woman (the same woman, but in very different circumstances). Tommi Lee Jones is excellent and not transcendent, as well, and is only in parts of the second half in a role that's sort of too familiar if you've seen the much better The Fugitive.So what gives it anything worth the mutton? A promise of clarity and retribution. Judd is accused, we assume incorrectly, of killing her husband. The authorities decide to go along and throw her in jail for six years for murder even though there is no body.Naturally it's not so simple. And the pursuit, after her release, is part revenge and part, Oh, come on. What it lacks in believability it tries to make up for in excess (the cars on the ferry for a start). Give Judd credit, she makes the most of the action. She is steely and determined in a way we like. She's our hero, after all.The sensational follows the unlikely and eventually all is resolved, with a couple last unimpressive twists. Yeah, you get the idea, it's about the twisting and not the terrible fact that this woman lost years of her life and can't get back together with her son.

If not for the looks of Ashley Judd I may have actually walked out. Notice I said looks, not acting ability.Judd plays Libby Parsons, a woman with a young son and a successful husband. But one night while on board a small boat, she wakes up to find her husband missing, and herself accused of killing him. After being convicted of his murder and being sent to prison, she finds out that he's still alive. So when she gets out on parole 6 years later, she sets out to find her husband, kill the b**tard, and get back her son. I suppose written that way, the movie doesn't sound too terrible. But the name of the movie is Double Jeopardy. As we all know, either from actual knowledge or watching enough cop and lawyer movies, double jeopardy means that you can't be tried for the same crime twice. There are exceptions of course, but in simple English, that's it. So while in prison, a compassionate murderer tells Libby that since she's already been convicted of her husband's murder, she can rightfully go kill and him there's nothing the government can do. Well all I have to say to that is WRONG!!!First, since she didn't really kill him the first time, if she kills him for real, she's not really being tried for the same crime. Different act, different circumstances, different murder. Second of all, she was initially convicted in Washington state. If she kills him in another state, she can be convicted in that state since the two states are separate sovereigns. Third, she could be tried in federal court for Civil Rights violations (think Rodney King beating). Also, if you have a $2 million insurance policy on your husband, with you as a beneficiary, if you kill him, you're NOT getting the money! No insurance company would pay you for that, it's ridiculous even thinking about it. How many more people would kill their spouses if they knew once they got out of jail they're have money waiting for them? And how the hell is she out on parole after only 6 years? Every time a legal issue was brought up it was brought up wrong and it annoyed me more and more. I am the king of suspending beliefs when going to see a movie, but when the main plot point, the title of the damn film, is flawed, it burns me.So, you might ask, all that legal stuff aside, how was the film? Well, it still stunk. Ashley Judd may be one of the most beautiful actresses working today, but I never realized until now how lousy an actor she is. None of her emotions and facial expressions ever matched the scene she was in. Her range as an actress needs to be expanded somehow before I could ever believe that she was capable of any of what happened in this film. And the dialogue? A sampling Do you know who I am honey? They told me you were dead. No, I'm not. As a friend of mine said, If I were 10 years old, and someone I was told was dead all of a sudden turned up at my soccer game, I'd be running the other way in a hurry. The scenes in prison seemed unrealistic. I've never been in a women's prison before, but I can't believe a bunch of murderers, female or not, are going around baking cakes for each other. Tommy Lee Jones was the only saving grace in this film and he wasn't even in it that much.So overall, I thought Double Jeopardy was a waste of time. I apologize if this review sounds biased based on a flawed legal premise, but I think even if I was able to get past that, the movie was still bad. I'd suggest seeing something else instead.

There's no secret here, so I might as well lay it on the line. The whole premise here is that Libby is convicted of murdering her husband, but was actually set up by him. She goes to prison, he assumes a new identity. She gets told that once she gets out she can just seek him out and kill him and no one can do anything about it because she's already been tried for his murder and can't be again. Double jeopardy. Wait a minute! Double jeopardy means not being tried for the same crime twice, but surely if he's still alive and she murders him again that's a different crime. She can't be tried for the killing on the boat again but anything else is fair game. So, that just really irritated me the whole way through and made the premise of the movie ridiculous.As to the rest of the movie, quite honestly it came across to me as a sort of Saturday afternoon made for TV movie (except that it was big screen), with a bit of a silly plot and performances that were average at best. In a way it's sort of a remake of The Fugitive, with Ashley Judd playing Libby, the convicted murderer on the run trying to prove her innocence, and Tommy Lee Jones as Travis - as in The Fugitive a law enforcement official (this time a parole officer) out to get her.

The actors were great, but lacking great direction. Now, if Alfred Hitchcock had stepped in as director, this film would have been as good as To Catch a Thief or Rear Window. But no, it sucks because the director sucked. He had no insight on how to make a good suspense film flow correctly. Ans how could anyone not have realized working on this film that you can't take a gun on a plane? I know this was pre 9-11, but even before that you couldn't take a gun on a plane. Was she just so cute that no one thought she would have a gun? Yeah, right!And the whole Matty story plot was sooooo fake. I did not feel the chemistry at all. I don't know whether Judd is a mom or not, but she sure didn't act like a mom towards Matty. And who the heck calls their kid Matty? It was annoying! Also, he was suppose to be 2 years old in the opening scene and he looked more 4 or 5. So it just wasn't cute to have the kid singing his ABC's when he should already know them at 5 (plus, the kid actor looked annoyed he was even in the movie to begin with). This film did a poor job depicting prison and I feel they skipped over the most essential part of the film- her six years in prison. She wouldn't be the same Elizabeth within those six years. The movie could have expanded on her prison life for more than 3 scenes. I feel like the scene where she is running in the courtyard and using the weight machines was just thrown in as an after thought. Oh, she's gotta get tough now so she can kill her husband. Yeah, okay. Lame scene. Plus, we never see any guards???? Were they just at a big summer camp for criminals???The whole beginning scenes were poorly written as well,and once again, there was just NO chemistry between Judd and that Bruce guy. (he is old). Yuck, the idea gives me the shivers. A suspense film is suppose to leave the audience in suspense but the audience knew what was going to happen every step of the the way! It was lame, and so tiring to watch that I got a headache. I would only watch this fluff if you like to watch Ashley Judd. Otherwise, it's a big waste of your time.

You'd think she was sent to the time out corner instead. Judd portrays the same character leaving prison as she DOES when she enters. Wait, I take that back. Her character does do some sit ups to prove that she's tough now. Please .And you'd think this was another in the Fugitive series like US Marshalls was. Tommy Lee Jones needs to watch out that he doesn't make another movie where he's chasing a convict, or that's all he's going to be known for. Jones is a great character actor, and I love his work, but nothing he can do can help this lame duck of a script.The final nail in the coffin for me was the finale, which is shot in New Orleans. I'm from Louisiana, so perhaps I'm more sensitive than most, but few movies get the accents right. One of the few movies that come to mind that does get it right is Heaven's Prisoners. Suffice to say that Double Jeopardy butchers the accent. Not to mention the fact that everything is set in the French Quarter, as if that's the only thing IN New Orleans.Overall, this film is nothing but a series of cliches and cop outs. None of the characters have any depth. They are simply cardboard cutouts set against a paper thin story.

The result was a sore disappointment. Watching it in my law class, I noticed that I was more and more fascinated by my desk than the film.The film has its redeeming qualities a rather neat stunt is pulled off on a ferry (it delivers minimal, if any, thrills, but is sort of neat), and a complicated car manoeuvre in traffic is successfully pulled off. The redeeming qualities end there.A huge complaint I have is the film's ridiculous premise. An inmate tells Libby about double jeopardy and how she can use it to her advantage, claiming she was a lawyer. I barely managed to refrain from bursting out laughing. Ridiculous! As someone with a slightly above average knowledge of law, the film's premise was ridiculous. You are tried in a court of law on a certain charge based on certain facts. Example you have been convicted of killing Bob Jones on April 16th, 1987. Change the circumstances, and a new charge surfaces. Example You killed Bob Jones on January 27th, 2001. The film's premise is, therefore, hard to swallow, and emerges as preposterous, not something that a mere suspension of disbelief will cure.Now, let me address the film and its problems in general. We open as Mary Sue&#x85; I mean, Libby, is given a present by her husband a fishing boat she's fallen in love with. On the romantic cruise they take, the husband is killed. So far so good. Here is where Libby's Mary-Sue-ishness comes into play she bursts out uncontrollably in tears at all the right (i.e. dramatic/emotional) bits and is cold and emotionless at all the other bits, other than one or two bits of Mary-Sue-ish, giggly laughter. Far from complex, she is a ridiculous cardboard caricature who is hard to sympathise with. After being found guilty (of course), she goes through a ridiculously fast, female version of The Shawshank Redemption (consider two black women bet cartons of cigarettes as to how long she will last in prison. Of course, in the 2 minutes Libby is at the prison, with no transition, they become immense friends, one of the women even making a cake for her son's birthday. When she exclaims she is innocent, the women react with false cheers of support. The six years in prison, where the psychological damage to her could've been shown in a powerful way, is glanced at in passing in a few minutes. We see Libby train herself physically once she finds out that she can actually kill her husband.) She then falls into the hands of Tommy-Lee Jones as her parole officer. She makes the stupid move of trying to break into a school to find out where her son now lives. Tommy catches her, and a chase ensues, where it shows that all of Libby's training has been completely useless. Gosh. A shame, ain't it? Libby naturally escapes custody (in a neat concept for a stunt off a ferry, but one that delivers no thrills). She then goes off to pursue her son. Long and short of it is she eventually kills her husband (who tried to kill her earlier and then one more time right before his death) in self-defence. (Of course, she's painted in rather jolly colours, as she doesn't plan on killing him, giggling with glee when her gunshot misses him.) The film ends on a sickening, syrupy-sweet reunion moment between Libby and her son.The Verdict Alfred Hitchcock, the master of suspense, came up with his infamous bomb theory, distinguishing between shock and suspense. Double Jeopardy walks around wearing the label of a thriller, but its only shocks (not thrills) come from a) gunshots the audience knows are coming, but not exactly when OR b) Sudden, noisy appearances of the bad guy that are obviously coming, but again, the audience doesn't exactly know the precise time. Poor performances from Ashley Judd and Tommy-Lee Jones (who reprises an essentially identical role from The Fugitive, chasing after an innocent person) add to this incompetent mess of a movie.Overall Rating 2/10 "},{"Title":"So very bad","Date":"17 August 2008","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Mystery, Thriller","Review":" Dear Lord in heaven do I hate this film! There I said it! To misquote Mystery Science Theater 3000 I want to hurt this film, but I don't think I can hurt it as much as it has hurt me.There is not a second of this film I cared about Ashley Judd's character, even when she was accused of her husbands murder... of course she didn't actually do it but I still would have loved to see her sent to the chair, does that make me a bad person? Anyway, when it all looks like it could be going south in her murder case she asks her BFF to look after her son. Sure her parents are still around but apparently they are such hideous creatures we don't even need to be told why the very idea of leaving him with them is unthinkable.Ashley is found guilty and goes to jail and after a few months both her friend and her son disappear. After tracking down a phone number Ashely calls her (former) gal pal and demands to talk to her son... only to have her son shout Daddy when Ashley's supposedly dead hubby wanders through the door.Ashley then turns to the worlds worst lawyer (who is also doing time... most would consider this as a big clue as to how bad this woman's legal advice would be) who tells her that, because of the legal principle of double jeopardy she is now free to kill her husband, as she has already been found guilty and served time for the crime. I cannot even begin to explain all that is wrong with that statement... just look it up for yourself.Armed with this new and INCREDIBLY incorrect knowledge Ashley get paroled and sets off to find her hubby, her slut former friend and her unattractive child. First stop of course is her parents for money.Hang on! Is this the same parents that she appeared to have cut out of her life and refused to let have custody of her son earlier? Apparently yes... and despite living what appears to be a small and slightly run down farm Ashley's mom comes through big time, handing over her life savings without so much as an I-told-you-so! According to this film people who work hard and will give you the shirt off their back are to be avoided...Anyway, Ashley tracks her husband down (on the way finding out that he may have killed her former friend in an insurance scam), takes a few photos, sends them to the authorities and clear her name. She sells her story for millions and goes on Oprah to promote her autobiographer.... just kidding.Of course what you would really do in this situation is confront your two timing, probably murderous spouse and promise to leave him alone as long as you get your kid... even though it means both you and your child will be on the run for the rest of your lives for breaching your parole.... Oh and did I mention that you agree to meet up to discuss the details of the arrangement in a graveyard? For God's sake, hubby should have gone for broke and demanded she meet him in a fireworks factory, covered in petrol and holding a lighted match! The film drags on to it's conclusion, with the only real entertainment being the discussions you have with your friends as to whether Tommy Lee Jones was actually ever on set, or if they just edited in scenes from his performance in The Fugitive directly into this piece of crap "},{"Title":"A Howler","Date":"15 June 2008","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Mystery, Thriller","Review":" I watched this film with my son and we howled at the clumsiness and the transparency of the plot progressions and the stupidity of the characters. I don't usually like to figure out where a movie is going, preferring to let it take me along for the ride. But in Double Jeopardy there is no ignoring the foreshadowing and you have to sit and wait for these dumb-clucks to figure out what's going on or blunder around to move the movie along according to the screenplay (was there really one for this mess?). Examples include Libby picking up the bloody knife just as the Coast Guard arrives to arrest her; Libby learns her husband isn't dead by placing a phone call to her best friend who has custody of her son, where the son blurts out Daddy! as the father enters the room at that moment; Maddy, the son must never wonder why Mommy is in prison after visiting her there; Libby doesn't contact her attorney or anyone else after learning hubby is alive to help her beat what turns out to be a 6 year 1st degree murder rap (6 years?); Libby's confession at her parole hearing, which is held in a gymnasium, with her confession convincing the parole board to release her; her mother (why wasn't she taking care of the son?) digging up money from her veggie patch to give to her fugitive daughter; getting names and addresses to trace culprits using the flimsiest of charades; characters just wandering New Orleans and discovering one another. These are but a few of contrivances used to sell this film. It was good for laughs. I stopped laughing though when I found out this film grossed almost $120 million dollars. There are, apparently, suckers born every minute.

It's impossibly contrived, melodramatic, and just plain boring.Ashley Judd's character is wrongfully imprisoned for the killing of her own husband (who changes his name, moves across the country, and enjoys the comforts of a sizable fortune).  Out on parole, she discovers that, having already been tried for the murder, the 5th Amendment will allow her to execute him without legal consequence.  A reasonably intriguing premise for a film that has a lot of potential for discussing the ethical dilemma of revenge... unfortunately, that opportunity is wasted for the sake of cheap soap opera drama and stupid plot twists.  Only the most naive in the audience will be able to stomach any of it.To attempt to find a positive thing to say about this trainwreck of a film is difficult.  The best aspect you'll find is probably Ashley Judd, who does the best she can with a character of little intelligence and no development, surrounded by equally imbecilic supporting characters, in absolutely inane situations that require a superhuman suspension of disbelief to swallow.  The worst part is that the film seems to think highly of its own intelligence.  If it were intended as a parody, it may have at least had some comedic substance.  Alas, all the comedy is unintentional.This may possibly be the worst film I have ever seen. "}{"Title":"How does this movie suck?

Pretty, sexy and smart, especially when she talks dirty.But please, Mr Screenwriter, how about something a little riskier and a little more realistic. It's a foregone conclusion that Ashley is going to win and get her boy, but does she have to lay waste to everything and everybody that gets in her way? And suffer no adverse effects? Ashley was innocent to begin with. I'll give you that. However, her very short (6 years) prison stay for MURDER is questionable. She certainly is clever in finding leads on her dead husband, but how lucky can a girl get? Doesn't anyone else get any good fortune, even a bad guy? Interesting that Ashley knows exactly where the hinges are in her casket so she can blow them off easily. Also, her wonderful and stupid husband decides to kill her off but doesn't. He just stuffs her in a casket alive. Doesn't he know that she can easily get out of that one? But then that would be the end of the movie, right? What got me the most was her gross lack of gratitude to her parole officer. He saved her life literally twice and helped her to get her child and all he gets is thank you? And that only after she hit him over the head with a pistol right after he saved her life in the sinking car and while he was treading water and destroyed TWO of his cars and many, many other things. I don't suppose that he was in any danger of drowning was he? That would have put a new wrinkle on Ashley's plight now wouldn't it.We all sympathize with Ashley's character, but Tommy and the public did not do anything to justify the wake of destruction that she created.C'mon guys, lets do these things right from now on.

The crisis comes when she and her husband Nick are spending one weekend together on their yacht. Libby wakes up to find herself covered in blood and Nick missing. To make matters worse she is arrested and charged with his murder, the presumed motive being to profit from his life insurance. Although no body is ever found, Libby is convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. While in prison, Libby comes to suspect that Nick is still alive, that he faked his own death and that he framed her for the crime in order to start a new life under a false name with her best friend Angela, to whom Libby entrusted the care of her son.The title Double Jeopardy relates to the rule of law which states that the same defendant cannot be tried twice for the same crime. It normally relates to situations where a defendant has already been acquitted of a crime, and means that he cannot be tried again for that crime even if fresh evidence of his guilt comes to light later. It also means that a defendant who has been convicted of an offence and punished cannot be re-tried and given a second punishment. The film-makers here, however, seek to give the doctrine a radically new interpretation. It is seriously suggested (by two characters who are supposedly legally qualified) that Libby, having been convicted of a crime which never actually took place, is now at liberty to commit that same crime in reality- in other words she has a licence to seek her husband and kill him.This is not an interpretation which any lawyer would place on the double jeopardy rule. (I note that no legal adviser is listed in the credits). I wondered if the film-makers had simply found an impressive legal-sounding title (possibly inspired by the classic film noir Double Indemnity, which concerns a woman who actually does murder her husband for insurance money) and then tried to concoct a plot which would fit it. Certainly, Libby, on being released on parole, does try and track Nick down, but we are never sure if she really does intend to kill him or merely wants to be reunited with her son. The novel legal doctrine is never actually put to the test in court.The obvious lack of care taken with the legal aspects of a crime thriller is symptomatic of what is wrong with this film. The whole thing is a derivative example of film-making-by-numbers, full of implausibilities and plot-holes. Why does Nick evolve such a complex plot in order to arrange his own disappearance? Why was a woman convicted of such a bloody murder given parole after only six years in jail? How does Libby manage to escape so easily from her probation officer? Why does he follow her all the way from Washington State to New Orleans to try and track her down after she jumps parole rather than leave that task to the police? The answer in each case is simply because the plot requires it.It was doubtless a blow to the filmmakers when Jodie Foster had to withdraw from the film due to her pregnancy, but I doubt if even an actress as gifted as she could have saved this film. The main problem is not the acting (all the actors, including Jodie's replacement Ashley Judd, were perfectly adequate) but the implausible plot and creaking script. Tommy Lee Jones has given some good performances in films such as The Fugitive and Heaven and Earth, but here, as Libby's alcoholic probation officer (and a former law professor)he seems wasted.The director Bruce Beresford is one of those foreign-born directors who seem to get trapped in a rut on moving to Hollywood. In his native Australia he was responsible for some original and challenging films such as Breaker Morant, an intelligent exploration of the morality of war; since moving to America in the 1980s he has made some good films (notably Driving Miss Daisy)but too much of his output is standard formulaic Hollywood fare. Double Jeopardy falls firmly into that category. 4/10 "},{"Title":"Dreadful, Predictable, Little Legal Research","Date":"23 February 2005","Score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Mystery, Thriller","Review":" I guess I should say, out of an abundance of caution, that this contains a spoiler in the last paragraph, although it doesn't really since this is a spoiler only in a very general, broad sense.

I just couldn't bring myself to give it more.The acting by Tommy Lee Jones is pretty good, as I would hope, and he is the only really good point about the whole movie.Otherwise, the basic plot is tired and it is thoroughly predictable.The one twist that they try to throw in, about double jeopardy protecting someone from being prosecuted twice for the same crime, is poorly used, poorly researched, and a rather weak addition which alone cannot save the otherwise lame plot. This is especially true since someone may also be able to kill another in self defence, a fact which, considering the bad husband's tendency for violence and self-preservation, logically could obviate the need to rely on the double-jeopardy protection at all. Therefore, by only turning to double jeopardy rather than self-defense to make the film original the makers are making only a meaningless, superficial change. Moreover, anyone with any legal education or knowledge of US government will understand the meaning of the title from the start and realize where they are going. Finally, had they really done their research, the makers might have discovered, and utilised, the fact that in the U.S., general police powers (for handling crimes such as simple murder) are vested in the states, and that while each state must apply the double-jeopardy rule for all crimes/convictions within its boundaries, they do not all apply it where the original crime and conviction occurred in another state. The makers ignored this point and yet they could have utilised it to make a much more interesting movie with an unusual ending.
