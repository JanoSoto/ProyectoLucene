It has incredible pace and flair, with both the script and the direction demanding equal attention. And it just works so well on so many levels. Whilst it is a political satire, it also stands well as a story in its own right. It's great to see Matthew Broderick in a good film. Reese Witherspoone turns in what I consider to be a career-best, and Chris Klein is wonderfully endearing as a jock with a heart of gold.What I really love about Election is the way its pace doesn't let up at all. By the time you've finished you feel like you've seen a good two and a half hours of movie. It's the only film I know that seems longer than it is in a good way.This film made me laugh out loud more than any other I can remember that isn't just a dumb comedy. But Election also doesn't take itself too seriously. The direction can accurately be described as deadpan - with Chris Klein, stripped of his ability to play football, gazing soulfully out to sea, and falling asleep over a book on philosophy. The way that each major character is afforded a voice-over, giving us an amusing insight into their psyche, is a wonderful technique, and the freezeframes of Reese Witherspoone's contorted facial expressions truly are moments to treasure.What more can I say? Election is smart, funny, and biting. It maintains its brilliance for the entire duration of the movie, and the ending is wholly satisfying. In fact, I can't actually think of one word of criticism. You'll have to search long and hard to find a better film anywhere, which is why I'm giving it a stellar nine out of ten.

And his two more recent films--Sideways and About Schmidt--have been much gentler (thought still terrific) than his earlier efforts. Before Election, Payne had already made Citizen Ruth, a caustic, bracing satire of the abortion issue, and Election continued his penchant for harsh, uncomfortable comedy. I mean that in a good way, though. Payne's movies are funny, but they make you uneasy for laughing at them, and they have sharp, intelligent insights into the attitudes that drive American values.In Election, Payne uses a high school class presidential election as an opportunity to lampoon everything that's goofy about the American political system. Just as in our national elections for president, the winner is not necessarily the person with the most integrity, and honesty is a liability, not a virtue. The person who is willing to play dirtiest comes out on top, and elections aren't about who is most qualified but rather about who is most popular. And, the best part about the movie is its acknowledgement of voter apathy. Most Americans don't really give a damn, something that makes them not so different from the majority of high schoolers who don't even understand the point of having a class president to begin with. In fact, in the film's best scene, the assembly at which each candidate gives her/his campaign speech, one of the candidates (who joins the race out of spite) gets the best reception from the crowd when she encourages everyone not to vote at all.Reese Witherspoon gives a wonderful performance as Tracy Flick, the school's most likely to succeed, whose goodie-goodie exterior hides the fact that she's willing to do just about anything to get ahead. Matthew Broderick is refreshingly unlikable as a social studies teacher who would like to see Tracy fail just once, until the fact that his own life is falling apart turns this wish into an obsession. And Chris Klein has some fun as the dopey, Jesus-following popular guy who becomes Tracy's arch rival, but never really even knows it.Payne doesn't tidy up his film's moral messages. On the one hand, Tracy is obnoxious, and we want to see her fail as much as Broderick's character does. But she does know how to play the game, and isn't that part of what makes someone a good leader? We sympathize with Broderick up to a point, but his motives really are driven by a personal vendetta, not by any altruistic ideal of right vs. wrong. So if you normally need someone to root for in order to enjoy a movie, you're probably not going to like this one. But who expects a hero?...I mean, come on, we're talking about American politics here. Grade A "},{"Title":"Alexander Payne's uncompromising look at highschool politics. Foul-mouthed, sharp and funny","Date":"28 October 2006","Score":"36 out of 51 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" With me, Alexander Payne can do no wrong. Before he entered Hollywood's big league of directors with ABOUT SCHMIDT and SIDEWAYS, he made this remarkable film about a highschool election. But this is hardly your average highschool flick, this is an intelligently written, foul-mouthed film, filled with colorful characters and plenty of laughs in the process. In a pitch-perfect role, Reese Witherspoon is Tracy Flick, one of those irritating girls that are always in the front row, always raise their hand and wanna do something for the sake of the school, read, for their own resume. Tracy Flick is one of those, a fiercely calculating careerist who will stop at nothing to get the main prize, the office of student body president at Carver High. Since she's running unopposed, nothing seems in her way at getting what she wants, again. History teacher and student government adviser Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick, Ferris Bueller reversed) seems content with his life, but is worn out by his love-less marriage, and by the plight of his best friend and colleague, sacked for sleeping with consenting but under age Tracy Flick. With the coming elections, McAllister is appalled by the prospect of working closely with this little nagging career bitch, and charged with overseeing the proceedings, discreetly sponsors a rival candidate, dumb but popular jock Paul Metzler (Chris Klein), to enter the election. But when Paul's sister Tammy (Jessica Campbell), an embittered and unpopular girl announces her candidacy, the election becomes a really back-biting and nasty affair, with Jim McAllister getting more than he bargained for.I think this film might appeal even more to adults than teenagers. If you like Alexander Payne's uncompromising approach to his subjects, this will definitely be up your alley, with everything from lesbianism to adultery thrown in the mix. Ideally casted all the way, with Matthew Broderick, after a number of uninteresting roles in lame movies, really making his mark. He gives his role a sort of understatement that makes Mr. McAllister a hopelessly tragic, but utterly lovable loser.Camera Obscura --- 9/10 "},{"Title":"An outstanding satire","Date":"1 February 2005","Score":"61 out of 102 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" Ethics and Morals I'm not generally a fan of excessive voice-over and quirky, stylised direction but here it's all done so well.

That film was a satire on abortion, with Laura Dern as a pregnant homeless woman with several children already taken away by social services, and who is caught in a tug-of-war between pro-choice and pro-life activists.  I've never seen an abortion satire before, so that was fresh, but all the characters where instead caricatures, so it was difficult for me to laugh.  And the points were made with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer swatting a fly.ELECTION suffers somewhat from that problem, but most of it works.  Much of that, of course, is due to Matthew Broderick and Reese Witherspoon.  Both of them embody their characters down to a T, and while they show us their flaws and their laughable parts, they also made them human beings.  As much as we're meant to dislike Tracy, for example, I actually felt sorry for her when she talked about being lonely.  And how events proceed between them is logical and well-told.Less well-done is Chris Klein as the jock who runs against Tracy.  He's likeable at times, but I could see Klein condescend to him and make him a boob at times(as his sister Tammy, on the other hand, Jessica Campbell makes a good impression; I was actually surprised at an action she took, though it does make sense).  I also thought the sexual repression stuff was obvious and overdone, especially when Broderick sees and hears Tracy when he's making love.  We got that already.  Nevertheless, this is often funny and biting.

Genius and overachiever Flick (Reese Witherspoon) acts like a chirpy angel on the outside, but look closer and she's vindictive, mean spirited and sexually precocious. Teacher Jim McAllister, who enthusiastically helps his students and school, is no better, as he cheats on his wife and embarks on a plot to ruin Flick's electoral chances. And on and on it goes, Payne peeling back pretence to reveal a cast of nasty, predatory schemers. Teachers suck up to students for sex, students selfishly run for candidacy in an attempt to get kicked out of school, and others merely take part in the election because they were manipulated into running. The point life's a political rally, everyone has an ulterior motive, everyone's a spin-doctor, everyone's constantly maintaining their own little user generated political campaigns, designed to mislead, sucker, curry favour and win votes of confidence. Open your mouth and you're playing the game too.Election does well to depict human behaviour as a cycle of neural elections, biochemical ballots held in our heads in which conflicting aspects of our messy personalities vie for what we say and do. But there's no democracy in our heads, and often instead a predisposition to tyranny; a kind of soft, interior fascism. Payne traces the damage and consequences of this, each of his characters unwittingly leaving a trail of pain and destruction in their wake. They all pretend to mean well but no one means what they say, self-interest trumps altruism and altruism masks darker, swirling emotions anyway. It's a hopeless film.Election was released a year after Wes Anderson's Rushmore, a film whose plot it heavily resembles. But Payne's tone is closer to Todd Solondz and to a lesser extent the follies of the Coens, Neil Labute and Woody Allen. It's a conceited film, too impressed with its own cynicism, pessimism, and cast of cartoonish cretins, perverts, jerks and losers, but Payne is also perceptive in the way he forces you to continually reassess his characters. Little Flick, for example, seems like Payne's villain, but on the other hand she's a marginalised, lonely, sexually abused girl whose drive to succeed is the result of external pressures working on her. A similar inadequacy fuels her teacher McAllister, who sabotages Flick's campaign because his own life is in shambles. McAllister rationalises his actions as being ethical because Flick sabotaged the campaigns of other candidates &#x96; and on one level he's right to do this &#x96; but Flick's plot to exclude the other candidates, which echoes McAllister's plot to exclude Flick, itself merely echoes the social exclusion (deleted scenes further highlight that Flick lives in poverty) or alienation that drives Flick into politics. It's a kind of feedback loop, selfishness and jealousy breeding selfishness and jealousy, in which every subject justifies their action as being ethical because the other has no ethics.Election is often touted as a satire on political campaigns. But the film is barely a satire, and has very little to do with politics, other than its broad jabs and your typical US candidates. In this regard you have the stuck up conservative who is secretly liberal in her private life and eventually reveals herself to be a kind of joyless Orwellian freak. Then there's the rich airhead candidate who's privately moral and upstanding but nevertheless knows and stands for nothing. Meanwhile, another candidate embodies a form of very modern, impotency and apathy. She eventually ditches the system to make out with her lesbian lover. Matthew Broderick, formerly known as a youth star of 1980s high school movies, is well cast in a somewhat ironic adult role. In the 80s, his characters typically rallied against the type of character he plays here.8/10 &#x96; Worth one viewing.

There are three candidates, and they couldn't be more different Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) is an annoying, over-intelligent, overambitious, spoiled girl who wants nothing less than the best and is willing to do anything to obtain it (if Lisa Simpson and King Kong's Carl Denham had a kid, it would be her), Paul Metzler (Chris Klein) is an ex football champion who thinks he can do good things for his fellow students, as well as gain some popularity, while his sister, Tammy (Jessica Campbell) is running for president only because Paul stole her girlfriend.

Election was released to a small box-office intake, but a hugely positive critical response, which has since made it a cult film. It launched the careers of actors, such as, Chris Klein, who after his debut performance in Election went onto to star in the teen-garbage of the American Pie series. Yet, dead in the water actors like Matthew Broderick found that the film re-launched his career, notably due to the polar-opposite casting choice when you look back at his Ferris Bueller days. Then you have actress Reese Witherspoon who provides an unmatched performance (in fact one of the best I have ever viewed) in Election, which warranted all the critical acclaim it could muster and was the perfect display of acting needed to launch her continuously expanding career.Election has what the vast majority of high-school films do not, which is a profound aptitude of control and dissection of politics. Adapted from a novel by Tom Perrotta, Election creates a contrast of high-school politics against western country politics. Reese Witherspoon embodies the personality of Tracy Flick, an ego-driven, overly ambitious and obnoxious go-getter who &#150;as with everything educationally related- decides to run for the school president elections (certain that she will win). Matthew Broderick plays Jim McAllister, a teacher who has grown to resent Tracy for obvious reasons, as well as deeply-seated personal grounds. Tracy is the only student running for president and because Jim does not want to see Tracy succeed yet again he decides to bring a little competition into the game by persuading Chris Klein's character Paul Metzler to run for presidency too. Paul is one of the most popular guys in the school, meaning that Tracy feels a sting of competition due to his popularity advantage. From then-on-in the story starts to convey the personal trials and tribulations of each character as they desperately attempt to succeed in some form or another.Alexander Payne crafts not a comedy, but a satire on corruption and the clash of morals and ethics. Built on a screenplay of sarcastic, cynical hatred for a flawed system, Election puts school into an entirely unique, yet distinguishable perspective. On first viewing of Election (I have always been very fond of it) I felt the narrative was slightly unfocused and heavy-handed at times, but on a subsequent viewing I decided that, in fact, it is not. The editing is the primary key to the film, automatically engrossing the viewer to become engaged with a narrative which is recited through four diverse character perceptions. The body language of the characters is another fundamental element of the picture, being that it echoes a considerable amount of information on the traits and general persona of each person.Technically, the school is an allegory for the parable of school life being so prominently like that of the real world, but just not quite as unforgiving as that of the outside world. Many subtleties are littered throughout the film, for example, I noticed that seeing fruit within a scene would mark the perception of an unfortunate incident soon to occur (as well as the joke of Paul Metzler contradicting his choice of favourite fruit when he picks a banana from a fruit bowl). The non-linear tone of Election is what gives the film its instantly recognisable trademark style. It is the detailing of the subtleties and subtexts of school life which makes the viewer become engaged, since you want to digest everything the film is stating on the battle of justifying one's morals, while retaining society's ethics.Election says so much about school life, it enabled me to realise just how much a teacher knows about their pupil, and ultimately that they can read a pupil like a book, which is fairly intimidating. I cannot begin to express how much I recommend this to anyone who can appreciate the peculiarities of high-school personalities and the consideration of thought-provoking comedy Alexander Payne has poured into this modern masterwork. Do believe the hype.

Election contains at least as many plot twists as your typical mainstream thriller, but the film is given an additional depth because its characters--clichéd as they may be--become truly three-dimensional through their pitch-perfect interactions (they may not always be likable, but they are brilliantly performed). But I am ignoring Election's key strength--its hilarity. While Payne has a snarky tendency to mock his flawed characters off-screen, it's hard to imagine a group more deserving of mockery, especially McAllister. As played by Broderick, he is a truly tragic figure--a man we can empathize with, even when his actions are misguided by the standards of modern morality. He turns a swollen, bee-stung eye and the beating of a motel vending-machine into bits of tragicomic gold that should have earned him an Academy Award nod.

It's not often a comedy comes out that presents us with both really good acting, good directing, but also a decent script and intelligent humor. Matthew Broderck and Reese Witherspoon shine with such humor and insight into their characters, it's almost as though they were born to play those roles. The story is very unique and makes no attempt at being pretentious, and just tells it the way it's meant to be told. Witherspoon's character, Tracy Flick, remains one of the most memorable characters in the history of comedy, as well as her own performance, which was snubbed at the Oscars for a nomination.The movie is about Jim McAllister, told from his perspective, as he takes us through both his life and the school's most vicious students. McAllister is a respected high school teacher who partakes in many extra curricular activities including student council. As his own life slowly falls apart, Jim McAllister becomes obsessed with ruining Tracy Flick (Witherspoon) and her reputation as the smartest girl in the school by making her lose the upcoming election for school president. Chris Klein and Jessica Campbell co-star as Paul and Tammy Metzler who both run for president, ruining Flick's chances of winning.Acclaimed director Alexander Payne creates a subtle work that communicates a highly typical and hysterical idea about jealousy, lust and betrayal. There's much more to the story than a simple back-and-forth feud between the teacher and student. The deep psychology of the characters often becomes the motive of a much bigger problem. McAllister's lack of luck is a result of his own clumsy behavior, proving that revenge is not always the best choice. Tracy Flick's troubled past comes into play to fully produce a character who's stuck-up and perfect in every way. And although Election is a satire, the goofy antics of almost each scene makes you scream in laughter. Truly, a movie to watch to uplift the mood.The unique style of Election makes it one of the best movies of 1999. The simple, yet sophisticated screenplay and Reese Witherspoon's career-best performance keeps the movie really high on the list of Best Movies. Each second of the movie is entertaining and it never seems to be too much. Avoiding clichés, Alexander Payne found a way to tell a typical story and intertwine some pretty funny ideas about society, as well as hilarious characters that we just love to hate.

However, the only student running for the position is the overly keen Tracey Flick &#150; a driven student who he feels is callous and blames for his best friend being fired for falling in love with her. Desperate to prevent her becoming president, James convinces injured jock Paul to run, prompting Paul's love-scorned sister to also stand. Where once the presidency was a good clean-cut race, Tracey takes the competition badly, and it descends into something a lot more sinister.I wasn't totally sure about this film but I had heard good things about it and, even though the fact that it was an MTV Production put me off a bit, I decided to give it a try. The film is quite clever for the most part and takes the worn genre and clichés of high school movies and makes them into a quite good little political satire of sorts &#150; albeit one that is rather downbeat at times. The comedy is not laugh out loud funny and maybe that's a problem, but I enjoyed the parallels with modern politics (and sexual issues) and found it to make some good points in a funny way. Of course the end is rather downbeat but only because it is sadly believable.I must say that I was rather put off by a couple of different things. The first was the amount of sexual material in the film &#150; not a real problem but I was a little put off by how graphically the subject of underage sex was dealt with. This was a minor problem (if you can pardon the pun!) but what I found a little worrying was Payne's apparent misogynistic touch on the film &#150; all the men were hapless saps and the women held the real power all the way; I'm not saying this is not true but Payne has little sympathy for his female characters and they may come off better overall but there is no love lost for them.The cast opens with an amusing bit of role reversal that sees everyone's favourite high school student become a teacher in the shape of Matthew Broderick. Hardly having the best run of roles for a while, he is actually pretty good here even if some of what happens to his character doesn't seem to fit very well. Witherspoon is annoying but the difference here is that it is intentional! She easily fits into the character and her role has a great touch to it &#150; I'm not saying it is easy to enjoy her performance but she is good. Klein does his usual dumb jock thing but is fortunate that he has the material to support (this time) but I felt Campbell was left with a sympathetic character that was placed on the sidelines too much.Overall I enjoyed this film but it had its limitations. It isn't hilariously funny as many coming to this genre may expect but it is quite cleverly written. The story struggles a bit as it goes along, with threads left hanging that stop it being as tight as it maybe could have been but generally I enjoyed it but can see why some others have problems with it.

But is very clear what Payne did here. He picked 'stereotypes' of the Republicans and Democrats, and put them in the election candidates. Since the start is pretty obvious who is who. The characters are superbly developed, despite being often by means of narrative, which I personally don't like at all. Payne uses it in a stylish and creative way for about 50% of the time, and the other 50% of the time the voice-over is just pointless and annoying. But still, the story can be easily followed with paid attention.But what is important The way how it depicts this 'election' metaphor. The behavior of the students are exactly like how the people behaves in a presidential election. They get bored and knows that all the speeches are untrue, and they adore radicalism and ideas where the 'people' has the control of the situation. See the reaction of the students when they listen to Tracy's pompous speech, Paul's inapt speech and then Tammy's subversive speech. Is just fantastic, and so true.Alexander Payne's Election had everything to be considered a masterpiece, but unfortunately it abuses way too much of voice-overs and messy editing to the point of being annoying and distracting. I think there is definitely an overuse of the technique. But anyway, an excellent film and sure, one of the best of this great year that was 1999. 9/10 "},{"Title":"Pick Flick","Date":"30 December 2013","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" A high school teachers life begins to spin out of control as he advises and helps run a student election where a student shows that she will do anything to win.A very hilarious dark comedy that is truly an under appreciated film.

There are lots of exaggerated high school types (stereotypes) here, and the acting is generally wonderful. The election of the title is the voting for the school class president, and in this middle America setting there are lots of things to make fun of.The star is not one of the students, who are generally terrific, but a teacher who was in the middle of the action, Matthew Broderick. He's a decent presence, but depends on under playing things for laughs, and he's a lovable type. More interesting (and exaggerated) is Reese Witherspoon as the overachieving student who at first seems set to win the election hands down. She's funny, and convincing (even though she's a 23-year old playing a 17-year old).The challengers in the race are unlikely, funny underdogs. One is played by Chris Klein, a nice guy, a really really really nice guy (this comes into the final turn of events before the results are counted). I'm embarrassed to say I identified with him (which is not good for career development, believe me). He is also really likable and has lots of friends (I don't identify with that part), and so he's suddenly in contention. Then there is his sister, thrown into the race as a wild card, taking the stance that elections are stupid. Of course, her voters all probably boycott the balloting and you know how many votes she gets.But it gets vicious by an odd twist, and things get bad for everyone, somehow, including the teacher who tried to correct the results and, well, you'll see. It's all very funny, and silly. There is a subplot (a teacher-student fling) that intends to spice up the whole thing and this probably gets some laughs but it's forced and isn't followed up.You can easily draw flimsy parallels to our national elections with its own comedy, but this isn't a parody. It's just a situation ripe with low-hanging jokes. Which is pretty fun.

His most recent film is definitely one of my favourites of this decade and the previous one to that is almost as great as Sideways with a terrific performance of Jack Nicholson. I just watched recently and finally Election. Simply another gem of Payne, for sure I had big expectations and I'm not disappointed at all. I watched it without knowing a single thing about it, only that Payne directed it of course, and I think that was absolutely great.Anyway, it takes a subject that is simple and that should have been simple for the persons involved, a simple school election, so simple that there was only one candidate, the only student who felt a real interest for that election, something that was even an obsession for her. To begin we know two characters that somehow found in that election nothing but a messy situation that they still remember. These two characters are teacher and student, they are Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) and Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick). She is that mentioned unique candidate for the school election and he is a dedicate teacher who seems to be where he always wanted. A chapter in the past will be relevant in these present days, a chapter that is a secret for most of the people but that is not important when that chapter is in the mind of Jim and Tracy. In the end of the film we see that Jim has found a total new life in New York, new job and a new lady after the extremely messy school election. He sees Tracy, he is intrigue, it seems that Tracy has found the success and the power. For sure Jim will not forget Tracy for a long time but not just due to that moment that happened during his visit to Washington, D.C. but because as soon as Jim sees someone with initiative, someone who seems to know it all he will see Tracy, no doubt about it. The case of his best friend marked him, is that mentioned chapter, he was even paranoid, he knew that as soon as he spend more time with Tracy he was closer to the place of his best friend. Upon that we have in Jim a man who will end with any of his problems just to open a bigger one. Is great, I loved the moments of happiness, there were moments when Jim felt that everything was just fine, that he could even start a new chapter in his life and for a reason he ended living in New York City. There are some interesting things; we always have a narrator that will expand our vision. We can trust in all the narrators and even that we feel that, as soon as they start talking, we can know many characters we will only know more about four characters the mentioned two, Paul and Tammy Metzler (Chris Klein and Jessica Campbell). With the candidates for the school election we can see three classic types of students and that is resume in the speech. Definitely one of my favourites scenes of the film, we see the student who is just an expert so the majority will find useless to debate with her. Other is the popular and likable character, he is funny so is not very important if his speech is just not good. And the other is the one who will connect with the majority because she is saying what a lot wanted to say. She is my favourite and she is part of another interesting take on a subject the family. She is sister of Paul and we have in both two narrators. We see with both how they see the other and how they don't know a lot of the other. But I was a nice ending for them and for Tracy but for Jim? Again is interesting since in the beginning he says to us that working as a teacher is the thing that he likes to do. What happens to a man when he loses everything? Everything he's worked for... everything he believes in? Driven from his home... cast out of society... how can he survive? Where can he go? New York City! For centuries people have come to New York seeking refuge from their troubled lives. Now I am one of them.So I really liked this film, it is funny and extremely entertaining. Most of the actors and actresses are unknown to me, I found some terrific acting. Finally, Payne is still great for me.

At least that's only one of the reasons.She plays one of the greatest and sinister characters from a high school movie, which I shouldn't title this underrated masterpiece. I would never put it in the same category as AMERICAN PIE or IDLE HANDS. Witherspoon's Tracy Flick is so unbelievably on target, which goes well with the rest of the marvelous cast (just study Matt Malloy's portrayal of the vice principal). She's the popular loner, cursed with Macbeth-sized ambition, that she doesn't care about meeting friends or having fun in highschool. She cares about getting ahead of everyone else, bing on top, and above all, being noticed. She even gives RUSHMORE's Max Fischer a run for his yearbook club memberships.Matthew Broderick has also been an many special-effect extravagant duds, it is more than refreshing to see him here as the sincere, bored and down-on-his-luck Government teacher.I think it was sheer brilliance for director Alexander Payne to make you root for Broderick as he tries to sabatoge Tracy's chances of winning class president, even though you find that in retrospect it's no big deal. The reason kids vote for Tracy isn't because they're good friends or even like her. They just don't care. The only person who cares about the election is Tracy.This is pointed out by another wonderful character, Tammy Metzler played by fresh newcomer Jessica Campbell. Campbell doesn't only play one of the best gay high school characters on film but gay characters period. I'm not a lesbian, she states in an interior monologue all the main characters share. I believe everyone needs someone to card for, and I just happen to like girls. Well, that's not exactly how she says it, I'm paraphrasing. But you get the idea.The reason why Payne uses so many interior monologues is because he doesn't want his film to be looked at with one point of view. He's not that kind of satirist. Maybe a very ambitious and spoiled teenager like Tracy will see this film and feel sympathetic toward Tracy as her life is almost ruined by Broderick's teacher. Maybe someone, like myself, will cheer Broderick on and hope that Flick learns her lesson and that there is such a thing as defeat and you shouldn't trample over people and abuse your power. Or maybe someone will be like Tammy Metzler and not even care of the outcome. Just enjoy the hilarity of it all.Also check out Payne's CITIZEN RUTH, another great comedy on the different sides of the abortion issue.

I thought this was a very good movie, not what I expected at all, very different from the typical teen oriented movie although I'm not even sure I should lump this in as a teen flick since so much of the film is about adults, particularly Mathew Broderick. Whatever genre this film falls into I liked it and thought it was above average.The school election is one of the main plot points but it is by no means the only focus of the film and that's what's really striking about the movie. It's about the election and it is not at the same time. It really explores the psyches of the characters and who they are as people. It not only shows the good and bad in them but the viewer also gets to see some of the forces that forms them. I think the movie is unique in a way and really distinguishes itself as more then just another little high school flick. Definitely a movie well done.The performances were for the most part excellent. Reese Witherspoon was great as Tracy and brought a lot to the role. But I think Mathew Broderick also deserves kudos. I've never seen him stand out as much in a movie as this one but this was a role that fit him well and he was very good. The believability of the movie was one of it's strengths along with the fact that the characters could inspire so many conflicting emotions in the viewer. There are a few scenes that are deeply poignant and tough to watch such as the scene between a sobbing Tracy and her mom after the election. The movie also stays interesting and there isn't one dull moment in the whole thing.Despite the Positives I wouldn't call it perfect. I did think to much time was devoted to the teacher and also to little time to some of the other kids besides Tracy. The ending was sort of flat. Not because It wasn't a happy happy joy joy ending, but because it simply seemed to rush over the outcome of almost everyones' story except Broderick's. Some of the supporting cast were very strong and not enough time was given to them, both through the movie and at the wrap up at the end. That to me, was the film's biggest weakness.I would give the movie a strong 7.5 of 10 and recommend it especially for fans of any of these performers or people who like teen movies with edge.

Amen. Tracy (Reese Witherspoon) is an overachieving senior in suburban George Washington Carver High School (where the student body is all white). What Tracy wants, she gets, using a combination of single-minded hard work, bright smiles as phony as a television infomercial, eager volunteering and a ruthlessness that varies between chirpiness and squinted eyes. As Tracy says, quoting her Mom, The weak are always trying to sabotage the strong. Then one of Tracy's teachers, Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick) decides the world needs to be saved from Tracy. He talks one of the school's popular football athlete's to run against Tracy. From now on Jim has his hands full trying to sabotage Tracy's relentless campaign, impregnate his wife, convince himself his next door neighbor, a recent divorcée, is really going to understand him if they can only check into a motel for a couple of hours...and deal with the consequences of everything he set in motion. Election, written and directed by Alexander Payne, is one of the funniest, darkest satires of human behavior since Jonathan Swift recommended that the poor should simply sell their children to be eaten by the rich. There are a lot of teenagers in this movie, but it's not just another teen-age movie. We're looking at the ludicrous depths to which ambition and good intentions, when mixed with politics, can take us. If that seems ponderous, it's about as ponderous as Tracy Flick's mom writing compulsively to people like Connie Chung and Elizabeth Dole asking for advice. (Never give up on your dreams is the usual reply.) The script moves from the exaggerated to the outlandish with great style. The actors deliver the goods with deadpan sincerity and self-serving honesty. Reese Witherspoon as Tracy Flick hits the bull's-eye with unnerving accuracy. She is so sincere in her insincerity, which is, in Tracy Flick's own way, completely sincere, that Witherspoon makes us smile and shudder at the same time. As outstanding as she is, Matthew Broderick is the heart of the movie. Jim McAllister is part lech, part nebbish, but mostly good guy. It's a funny, almost poignant performance. Payne's script and Broderick's acting give us a perfect ending that's just as brittle, cool and amusing as the rest of the movie. I like Election a lot.

However, when compared to the other high school comedies such as the abyssal American Pie series, it runs rings around its competitors. The humor is much darker and more cynical than a simple plot explanation would suggest.

Matthew Broderick is an actor thats likable yet with a seemingly limited range. However, he manages to create a sympathetic character. Even better is Reese Witherspoon. As an actress, Witherspoon is only as good as the material. Shes been stuck in a lot of crap like Legally Blond and Cruel Intentions. However, if shes given a good screenplay such as this or the one in Walk the Line, she can be quite impressive.Still, the film is deeply flawed. The use of multiple narrators as usual doesn't work. Also, many of the supporting characters (such as the lesbian high school outsider) aren't developed enough to be as compelling as they're initially presented. Also, while I appreciate the films use of darker and more cynical humor, there's a shortage of actual belly laughs in it. But, like I said above, its far better than it has any right to be.

Part of what you write has to be so exceedingly familiar, so that viewers can get established with the basic physics of the world you introduce them to. But to make it engaging, you've got to introduce quirks, and twists, and ironies, and comic annotations and reversals.You've got to make that first choice about what is ordinary before you even think about being clever. The two most accessible experiences for the largest demographic (at least in the U. S.) are high school and obsessive sex. With a few words and images in each, you can register which common scenario you are in, before the voyage begins.The setup here isn't particularly deft, but it doesn't have to be. High school. Simple people. Simple motives, in fact every dramatic turn in this project is triggered by some slight impression or annoyance. Each trigger leads to the extreme infatuation or obsession of some type. Each trigger (dumbly noted by an apple) leads to a downfall except for the two clueless kids, and I suppose the tragicomic point is that they have no idea of the damage left in their wake.The twists and turns were pretty edgy I thought. More clever than Wes Anderson and less visceral than Harmony Korine. But all this is of the same school which is anti story architecture, pro capricious twists. The twists have to seem that they just happened to the writer based on random selection or happenstance, not deliberation, like say the stream in `Go.'Witherspoon is good enough, but the part doesn't demand much. All her comic timing is from the playbook, as it should be because of the setup. She, with Julia Stiles is part of a post-Ricci crop of moon-shaped flatfaced actresses.

By assembling a fine ensemble, giving them outrageous yet credible dialogue and interactions, and including enough surprises to keep everyone guessing until the very end, Payne creates a highly amusing scandal out of a seemingly innocent scholastic tradition. Reese Witherspoon's devious overachiever and Matthew Broderick's frustrated burnout are the highlights of many outstanding performances, most of which are characters equally sympathetic and despicable. It's fitting that all these anxious adversaries become so dependent upon the outcome of something as trivial as a student body election, to the point where their obsessions take as much of a toll on their lives as the ballot box results. A few times Payne goes a bit too far and falls flat, including an unnecessary bee sting, but those instances are easily forgiven when so many of his risks are rewarding. The tangled web of incompatible motivations is entertaining and diverse, as demonstrated by the hilarious trio of pep assembly speeches given by the presidential candidates. Election is both an important chapter in the evolution of Alexander Payne and a welcome addition to the district of nonconformist high school films for both teens and adults that includes Heathers, Clueless, Dazed and Confused, Fast Times at Ridgemont High and their peers.

And if you try to interfere, the same thing's just going to happen anyway, and you'll just suffer.Election is Alexander Payne's sophomore film and many consider it to be his best work since it uses some slick and witty dark humor to make a satirical political comedy. Payne manages to mix this political satire with High School life by using the school elections as a metaphor for American politics and in doing so the film is rather successful. Just like that famous short essay written by Robert Fulghum All I Really Need to Learn I Learned in Kindergarten where he claims that if we sticked to the basic rules we learned in kindergarten we would live in a better society, here Payne compares politics to High School elections and shows how corrupt the system actually can be and how selfish these people are. The dirty campaigns all begin in High School and these people seem to be doing things for themselves rather than to help others. I think this is what works best in Payne's ambitious film. I enjoyed the scenes that took place in the High School, but when Payne takes us out of the school to the characters homes it kind of loses its magic. I didn't care very much about their lives outside of school. One of the things that Payne does best is create interesting characters and that is why the actors give engaging performances because they have a lot to work with. These characters are usually dislikable, but somehow we end up routing for one despite all their flaws. Reese Witherspoon's character is so annoying that we actually want Matthew Broderick to succeed despite all the immoral acts he is committing. They both give strong performances, although compared to other Payne films I thought they were the weakest characters. Sideways still remains as my favorite Payne film, but his work here obviously opened a lot of doors for him. Payne is one of the best when it comes to creating Midwestern American characters.Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) is a very driven and ambitious student from Carver High who has high goals and expectations for her life. One of those goals is becoming class president, and despite the fact that she is running unopposed she still dedicates most of her time in school to achieving this. Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick) is one of her teachers, but he doesn't like her very much because she had an affair with his best friend, Dave (Mark Harelik), a former teacher who got expelled from school when the director found out. Jim, who is married to Diane (Molly Hagan), decides to complicate things for Tracy by convincing the school jock, Paul (Chris Klein) to enter the race. When Paul's lesbian sister, Tammy (Jessica Campbell), discovers that he is campaigning for class president, she decides to run as well to pay him back for dating a former love interest of hers. And soon what seemed to be a simple election becomes chaotic as the dirty campaign begins. Will Tracy achieve her goal or will her teacher crash her dream?The film has each character describe the events that are going on through voice over narrations. At first I thought it didn't work very well as it took me out of the story, but then I understood what Payne was trying to achieve (or at least this is what it transmitted to me), by letting his characters narrate what they were experiencing we understood what they were trying to achieve, the way they wanted others to see them, but of course their actions were completely opposite to the way they wanted to be perceived. It was like their own mask, because they were nothing like what they wanted to be perceived as (take Jim for example who considered himself a likable and influential teacher, but really he ends up being quite the opposite). The characters in this film are very well developed, but they were probably my least favorite from a Payne film. I wasn't a big fan of Chris Klein's performance, but the rest of the cast was pretty strong. The dark humor was witty, but it just wasn't my cup of tea and didn't care for any of the characters. Election may be one of Payne's most ambitious and satirical films, but I would rather sit through Sideways a hundred times than seeing these characters again.

Alexander Payne's Election works on many levels because he knows how to tell this story from a directing, editing, and writing point of view, and never loses sight on the real issue here, which are the tactics taken by the rational and the irrational when a big choice is about to be made.We get three people's stories told wonderfully all in a concise runtime, with development and intelligence to assist them. Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) is your textbook, overachieving high school senior, who is determined, no, hellbent on winning the school council election and become the president - a rather petty, useless honor. Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick) is a teacher at the same high school, and knows Tracy's secret side, where her seduction and relentless passion got her in cahoots with his best friend, also a teacher, resulting in a teacher/student affair costing him his job and a divorce. After Tracy reminds him that when she wins the election, they will be spending a lot more time together, Jim, being a man with an ability of rational, critical thinking, feels he can dismantle her chances by persuading another student to run. This student is the slow-witted, but big-hearted jock, Paul Metzler (Chris Klein). Because of a skiing accident that left him with a severely broken leg, Paul is unable to play football this year and possibly the rest of his life, and feels his purpose in life has been discarded just like that. Mr. McAllister informs him that he is capable of a lot more than he believes and reminds him how unanimously liked he is with the students. Paul finally decides to run against Tracy, who was previously running unopposed, much to her dismay. It isn't long before Paul's revenge-hungry sister, Tammy (Jessica Campbell) joins the race, boasting a campaign on nihilism, saying that if she were elected, she'd put an end to school government to spare the class the trouble of sitting through another one of these stupid assemblies. Mr. McAllister works around the clock to assure Tracy's chances of winning are gone, and this is where the satire part kicks in. We see how worked up the man gets about a ridiculous school election which, SPOILER ALERT, winds up practically ruining his whole life.But, oh, what fun it is to watch everything unfold. The film will be more fun if you can fill in the characters, or perhaps be given the rare ability to connect with one of them. Within the first few minutes of the film, I scanned my head to try and pick a Tracy Flick I knew in school and was keenly reminded of the smarmy, annoying qualities she possessed.Election is given further amounts of care and attention because of its graphic emphasis on style. For example, all four characters, Tracy, Jim, Paul, and Tammy, get vital speaking time during the film, so it doesn't feel like a satire with caricatures instead of characters. Not to mention, performance-wise, the film is surprisingly observant, with Witherspoon giving her most involved and hilarious performance to date, Broderick doing some very funny work, and Chris Klein giving his most sentimental acting job in a while.As one can imagine, this is not your typical high school film. Its goal isn't gross-out gags or crass humor, but a comedy of intellectual heights and a satire on how a reasonably intelligent man, a teacher nonetheless, succumbs to such low standards just to tarnish a young woman's chances of winning a school election. While I vaguely sympathize with the Tracy character (Payne is careful in this department, not making one character intolerable or unlikable), I can't say I didn't crack a smile during scenes of her dismay.Starring Reese Witherspoon, Matthew Broderick, Chris Klein, and Jessica Campbell.

That's what the whole movie relies on, that's what's keeping you hooked. Alexander Payne is mainly known for directing Sideways and About Schmidt, but his style was already in full development here. He makes a beautiful analysis of some of the uglier American values here, it would actually be pretty depressing if most of the movie wasn't so damn funny. The movie managed to catch me off-guard several times and kept surprising me right until the ending, it's very unpredictable and thus highly entertaining.

It focuses on the lives of Paul and Trish Metzler, Tracy Frick (Reese Witherspoon), and their teacher Mr McCallum (Matthew Broderick). I will first analyse each of the characters, and then comment on the film as a whole.McCallum is the teacher that handles the student government body and the elections. At this time Frick is the only candidate but he does not like her. The reasons I will discuss later, but simply put, he simply found that there was a really nasty side to this apparently studious girl. As such he tries to rig the election to destroy Frick and promote the school jock Paul Metzler. Though one may think that McCallum has noble reasons for doing this, it could simply come down to the tall poppy syndrome. But then that is not really in line with his character, because McCallum is not the type of person that gets jealous. He loves his job and does not want anything more.This does not mean that he is not a content individual. He says at the beginning that he loves his wife, but it becomes quickly apparent that he does not. We actually see that there is a distance between them, and this is shown even more when he goes down into the basement to watch his porno movies. He is not an adulterer, but rather a man who has entered into a relationship that has turned stale. It is not clear if his wife feels the same way, but she really does not seem to be that concerned about what happens to him, and takes the first opportunity that arises to get rid of him. Tracy Frick is ambitious. She is the one that has taken opportunities to rise in fame and status in the school. This status has its draw backs though and that is that she has no friends. She is not hated she is just the ambitious one who has no time for friends. There are the few students that detest her, but generally she simply is too caught up in her work to step back and enjoy life.The reason the McCallum hates her is because one of her teachers, Dave, who happened to be McCallum's best friend, was destroyed by her. It began as a simple friendship and quickly blossomed into an adulterous relationship. When it began to get to hot for her, she used the fact that she was a student under Dave's care to completely destroy his career. It is this cruel and malicious side, a side that will do anything to get to the top, that he is fighting against by pitting her against Metzler, the school jock.In the end we are given the impression that Frick really never gained anything. She is seen with a politician, and it appears that she has actually climbed far, but the question is what did she lose out on and is she pained by it. The question is no for in college she realised that those who want to rise to the top rise to the top alone. It is that moment of epiphany that she realised that she wanted power and for that she had to forgo friends. Even though we only see a glimpse of her college life, we can see that she simply becomes the bitch and thus alienates herself more from her peers.Paul Metzler is the guy against Frick. He is opposite to Frick in almost every way. He is popular, wealthy, stupid, and most of all humble. As we are allowed into the minds of the characters, we see how Metzler thinks and we see a man who cares not only for others but for his sister as well. He finds this whole presidential race a little game, and isn't really concerned if he looses. Metzler finds that friends are far more important than power, and would rather give up chasing power and simply enjoy the company of his friends.Finally there is Trish. She is far more dangerous than Frick. Where Frick is callous, Trish is able to use her cynicism to work into what people hate and use that to raise their spirits. During the speeches, Frick gives a typical politician's speech, Paul a very poor recital of a speech written for him, and Trish then turns around, in a fit of emotional passion, uses the dislike of the whole election process to bring all the students to her side. In the end if she had been allowed to run, she would have destroyed the entire student government committee. As such, the teachers planned to destroy her chances and influence and ended up removing her from the school.This is a fairly good movie. It allows us to enter into the heads of the main characters. There are numerous important minor characters, but the characters that I have explored here we see into their minds and understand what they are thinking. As such these are the characters that we should focus on when trying to understand the movie. What it seems to show us is society in a microcosm, and the whole election process in a microcosm. There are the puppets (Paul), the ambitious ones (Tracy), and the destroyers (Trish), and then there is the power behind the throne (McCallum).

Basically at a suburban high school in Omaha, Nebraska is overachieving senior student Tracy Flick (Golden Globe Reese Witherspoon) who may be beautiful, but does have a vindictive and sexual side, she was caught having an affair with teacher Dave Novotny (Mark Harelik), but while he was fired and divorced by wife Linda (Delaney Driscoll) she did not get any punishment. Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick) is the Social Studies teacher at the high school with a good attitude on the surface, but he has hidden frustrations, and this includes in some ways towards Tracy. He is especially horrified that she is running for the upcoming student body president election, and deciding that she needs to be taught a lesson he decides to get a student to campaign against her. He chooses simple and sometimes slow but polite and popular football player student Paul Metzler (Chris Klein), who has been getting over his depression, having a broken leg that stops him playing, but this president idea has given him a sense of purpose. Paul's younger sister, lesbian Tammy (Jessica Campbell) has been dumped by her sweetheart Lisa Flanagan (Frankie Ingrassia), who said they were only experimenting together, and wanting to stay heterosexual she quickly hooks up with her own brother. Tammy becomes mad with this recent breakup and her brother's actions, so she decides to register for the election herself, but she is going with the point of view that the whole thing is a sham that will not amount to anything. It comes to the assembly to hear the three campaigns, Tracy gives a confident speech that gets a polite applause, Paul although rushed with a written speech gets a good reaction, but Tammy steals the show with her defiant speech saying that the election will not change things, no matter who is voted, and that there is no point to it, and this gets a rapturous standing ovation from the students. Tammy is soon suspended and ejected from the election, with fears that the school would lose its integrity and if she was elected she would bring down the student government body, and Tracy meanwhile tears all the posters campaigning for Paul in a moment of rage, Tammy sees her trying to dispose of them. Jim confronts Tracy after this happens and accuses her of tearing the posters down, but strangely Tammy takes the blame for it, and she is transferred to a parochial school for girls, this being her intention of the fake confession. Jim meanwhile is married to Diane (Molly Hagan), but is secretly attracted to Linda, as he has been helping her, and after kissing she asks him to rent a motel to get closer, and he quickly dashes, giving his class a pop quiz, to prepare the room ready for her arrival. After his class he goes to pick her up, but she is not at her house, so he waits a while at the motel, and then he finally decides to go home, and that is when he spots Linda talking to Diane, he realises he has been found out. During his attempt at sleeping with Linda, Jim got a bee sting on the eye in the process, and the next day he has to oversee the election vote results, and when the ballot is totalled one of the students counting says that Tracy has won amazingly by just one vote, this being Paul's honest vote not for himself but for her. She sees the reaction from the counting student and knows that she has won, but Jim spots her doing this, and when it is his turn to count the ballots he deliberately deducts two papers from Tracy's vote, and Paul is named the winner. Paul is ecstatic and excited to become the new student body president with some ideas for events and stuff, while Tracy is extremely distraught after thinking that she was going to win but didn't, however this may change after the janitor discovered the two missing ballot papers. With the Principal and other teachers and election staff knowing his deception, Jim resigns from his job, he also gets divorced and humiliated, but he bounces back after leaving Nebraska for a new life in New York, with a smaller and expensive apartment, and working at the American Museum of Natural History as a tour guide. We also see that Tracy was accepted into Georgetown University, Paul went on to the University of Nebraska, Tammy stayed at her school with a new girlfriend, and Jim recounts the last time he see his nemesis Tracy, and he may have a new irritant in the form of an overeager little girl asking and answering questions in his tour. Also starring Phil Reeves as Walt Hendricks, Matt Malloy as Vice-Principal Ron Bell, Donnie Darko's Holmes Osborne as Dick Metzler and Jeanine Jackson as Jo Metzler. Broderick, who keep in mind famously played high school rascal Ferris Bueller, does a great job playing the teacher with his own ideas of morals and standards, Witherspoon is also inspired as the student who thinks she can get everything and anything, and Klein is a good giggle as the nice guy student going against her. This is not only a great near teen movie and high school movie, but it serves as a fantastic insight into how election campaigns (for anything) go down, we can relate to the situations seen here, such as the system of voting, how results can be altered, and how many times there is no point or good result to them, whether the voter gets what they want or not, a very insightful, very funny and highly watchable satirical comedy.

It is a film telling the story of a handful of people both innocuously placed into situations they have no right in being anywhere near, and at once delivers a telling account of those whom go out of their way to both exploit and destroy the lives of certain others. Alexander Payne's film is a brash and often funny, in both a blackly and morbidly so sense, film depicting those caught up in an event spiralling out of control and eventually coming to ruin each of both their own, and most everyone else's involved, in the process.When one outlines that the film, in its barest of forms, is a piece about the behavioural patterns exuded by an array of different people of varying ages and genders brought about by an election, one is rushed into thinking that such an outline might put the majority of audiences off. In spite of this, Election comes to form a wondrously tight comedy/drama doing remarkably well in its exploring of such a thesis in a taut and intelligent manner. It is about the pratfalls of free-world politics; about the idea that anybody, from any background and of any nature, can run for something and have an opinion on things, but a film exploring such a notion through the lens of an American high-school inhabited by those less than pleasant once the exterior shells have been stripped away.There exists three principal characters without there necessarily being any specific lead; their interactions and dynamics coming to formulate the nucleus of the film and their behaviour driving the plot. The film is entirely liberal in its addressing of each of these people, wondrously remaining so in spite of its overall sending up of liberalism. There is a lone narrator initially guiding us through proceedings before certain others begin to get involved in his life much more than he would like. This person is Jim McAllister; a teacher at the high-school but an athletic man, a precise man and a meticulous man that is established through the film's opening scenes. McAllister is played by Matthew Broderick; if people whom were old enough to remember Ferris Bueller's Day Off when it was released didn't feel old when watching Broderick play that of a nuclear fallout scientist in the previous year's Godzilla, then chances are they might have done upon seeing the individual whom played that titular rouge back-in-the-day now teaching at a high-school.His introduction is inter-cut with that of Reese Witherspoon's Tracy Flick, her additionally concise nature in laying out numerous paraphernalia for her upcoming election campaign highlighting degrees of similarity in their coexistence's and priming us for the ongoing tussle which will later play out. Flick is an achiever; always first to answer the class question, she excels in numerous fields of performance, journalism and foreign languages and appears to just stand out when she sits in class amidst the rows of other classmates, as if glowing or radiating out from the rest of them and their less than enthusiastic, less than prominent features. If McAllister is aware of her, it is because a colleague of his lost both his job and his dignity at the hands of her and the ill-judged extra-marital affair his colleague got caught up in. Third in line is the student polar opposite to Flick in Paul Metzler (Klein), a big guy with a penchant for contact sports more-so school work whom, in McAllister's own opinion, is somewhere nearer the bottom of the student spectrum of greatness. Paul's sister Tammy (Campbell) even decides to run in the election herself, a decision motivated on a personal rather than a professional level when her bisexual girlfriend leaves her for Paul.Metzler comes to run for the election up against Flick when McAllister falsifies his belief that he has the ability to do so, a low blow aimed towards school-star Flick in what is an attempt to derail her ambitions and performance. There is an amusing instance in which Flick stares at him and his campaign table as he attracts the attention from the other students; he may not have the ability, but he is certainly popular &#x96; her disgusted gaze captured with some Morricone-like spaghetti western-esque musical tones reiterating a sense of conflict; a sense of these people, include McAllister if you will, caught up in a melting pot of tension and antagonism without necessarily being able to exteriority show such things prominent the American high-school equivalent to a Good, a Bad and an Ugly neatly summarised in this fleeting composition. Where that remains one instance of these parties clashing and coming up against one another, the film itself is a more than apt collective whole depicting sleaze and fallouts circumnavigating this election; a neat and timely alternative to your more typically adolescent high school caper which works.

Director Alexander Payne (Sideways and About Schmidt) manages to find a beautiful balance between intelligent satire and compelling drama in a way that never stops being comically enjoyable. It's as peculiarly captivating as Little Miss Sunshine and as innocently entertaining as Ferris Beuller's Day Off.Election time for Washington Carver High School is right around the corner and Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) already has her eye on the glorious prize&#x96; the position of student body president. Tracy hasn't even the slightest reason to worry. She's a confident and hardworking overachiever who has become a part of every major organization the school offers; she'll happily raise her hand to answer any question in any class; she evens arrives to school extra early to prepare to campaign for the student signatures she needs to enter the election- a campaign complete with a corny slogan and a manipulative bowl of gum for enticement. And most important of all, Tracy has no competition in the election (not that that stops her from taking the whole matter as seriously as if it were our nation's presidential election itself). In fact, there's really only one tiny tidbit that could potentially harm her chances&#x85; She recently got out of a secret, but very intimate affair with a teacher who was subsequently fired after the administration found out.Enter Mr. McAllister (Matthew Broderick)- a young teacher whose life has played out just as he had hoped. He's everyone's favorite teacher, he's involved in the social scene of the school, and he's one of the most highly valued supporters for the athletics department. Tracy Flick just might be the one thing that dampens his days, with her boring and rigid personality that frames her goody two shoes attitude. Even if he can't explain it, there's just something about her that rubs him the wrong way.So naturally, when Tracy becomes the leading (and only) candidate in the election, Mr. McAllister, the student council administrator, can't help but be disgruntled by her overwhelming involvement in everything. In the hopes of adding a more democratic element to the election, the three-time Teacher of the Year winner convinces injured football star Paul Metzler to enter the race, assuming that his popularity will give Tracy a challenge. And as if by domino effect, a third candidate joins the two opponents. Paul's sister, Tammy, sees her participation as a perfect opportunity to get revenge on her brother for stealing her beloved girlfriend. Ironically, the student body responds most emphatically to Tammy's anarchic tendencies and apathy towards school issues.Tracy's stress level reaches a whole new level as her desire to win nearly drives her over the edge, Tammy displays her passion for vengeance, Paul shows his embarrassingly pitiful political skills, and Mr. McAllister gets tied up in a complicated affair; all the basics of your typical high school election are carefully mixed for a remarkable end product.The quirky atmosphere of the small town and its dysfunctional inhabitants never relents and the story utilizes such simple stereotypes in an unconventional way that makes the characters' interactions a joy to watch. Comedic dialogue and entertaining twists around every corner, this caricature-driven work is wholeheartedly a fun film that will be especially enjoyed by those who prefer intelligent comedies with just a dab of drama. And perhaps most admirable of all, Election introduces a new type of high school comedy that drops the sleaziness and instead develops an experience that engages audiences with a story that creates plenty of laughs for those with the required number of brain cells. Not to mention, if the comedy ever falls short, it's amusing enough just to draw parallels to the juvenile affairs of the politics of our own government and certain recent presidential elections in the U.S. "}{"Title":"A satire of electoral and scholastic politics, Election may have been set in high school but it was not just another teen film.","Date":"9 July 2010","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" A bitter teacher (Matthew Broderick) sets out to derail the plans of an obsessively ambitious teenage girl (Reese Witherspoon), an academic star who wants to be student president at a Midwest high school.Election is brilliant comedic fun, underscored by obvious parallels with electioneering in national politics.

This is the first thing by Payne that I've watched, and I'd like to see more. With biting satire, this tackles love, ambition, and politics. As a dark comedy, this is hilarious, if it does get a tad hard to believe in a couple of places(never so much so that it takes you out of the enjoyment of the whole, however). It all revolves around a high school election. The plot is great, and it moves along very nicely. This has a solid pace, and you're not bored for a second. The narration shifts smoothly back and forth. This is quite well-written. The script and the dialog are excellent. There are several clever, quotable lines in this. The characters are well-developed and credible, if occasionally psychotic. It is a blast, as usual, to see Chris Klein parody himself and his physical size, something he must be rather comfortable with. The acting performances are very good. Matthew and Reese show a lot of range. There is plenty of strong language, as well as a bit(I'd say most of it is spoken or referred to) of sexuality(as this deals with frustration of, well, the meaning of the metaphor that comprises the first image of this is unmissable), and brief explicit imagery in this. The DVD holds an interesting director's commentary, though he can't stop praising Broderick.

It is a set during the election for the student presidency, with only one candidate Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon).

However, the history teacher running the election, Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick) does not want to her to run away with it because of her tendency of destroying people, including McAllister's friend who was sacked. McAllister brings in a ringer, Paul Metzler (Chris Klein), a nice but dim jock who had recently broke his leg and one of the most popular students at the school. As well, a third party candidate, Tammy (Jessica Campbell), Paul's sister. She wanted revenge because her girlfriend broke Tammy's heart and started going out with Paul. Tammy becomes the popular candidates because of her anti-student government ticket. This upsets the school and throughout the campaign dirty tricks breakout. A sub-plot of the film is Mr. McAllister is unhappily married, resulting with him watching porn and fantasising being with other women. He becomes attracted to his wife's best film Judith. Slowly his life in Nebraska falls apart.The director Alexander Payne, musts have had fun making this film, and it oozed stylist tricks which added to the visual effect of the film. The film also uses a voice over for all the characters which gives you an incite to all the character's thoughts, similar to the comedy show Peep Show. They are also a number of subplots which gives all the characters a chance to develop. It is a sharply written film, with good dialogue and has a interesting look at American High School. It is dark, looking at some dodgy subject matters and doesn't pull any punches. It's humour is subtle, and has a good at relationships, suburbia, high school and the American education system and American politics.A worthy film.

The sex and porn scenes feel unnecessary, is this a side to Jim McAllister that needs to be seen? It feels more an attempt to make sure the audience doesn't get too fond of Jim, who is still the main character despite three competing narrations, he isn't squeaky clean like Paul. In this vein, the Linda plot is excruciating to watch once the audience knows where it is going. Why is Jim so obsessed with her? Fair enough, his marriage is loveless, but what is so appealing about Linda? Although his home life disintegrating, and being stung in the eye by a bee are there to physicalise the stress Jim is under, it does feel a little like Jim's revenge on Tracy has more to do with him having a bad day, than a genuine desire to take her down a peg after everything he has seen her do.Clever, witty and fun, Election is a highly polished gem, but the nastiness running through the plot does leave a bitter aftertaste.

Each one is well-developed with just enough of a kernel of truth to make you care about them, even if you don't like them.The adults were well done, too.

But looking past that, I have to say that the movie itself was good, but different too.The story itself is well written. An overachiever named Tracy Flick (an excellent pre-Walk- The-Line Reese Withersoon) is running unopposed in an upcoming election for school president. One of her teachers, Jim Mcallister (an equally lovable Matthew Brodrick) feels that the idea is illogical to his view of ethics and morals. This, along with his light hatred for Tracy, leads him to convince a slow witted, but good hearted football star named Paul Metzger (a well cast Chris Klein) to run against her. Things get more complicated when his lesbian sister Tammy (Jessica Cambell) joins the election to get revenge on him for stealing her mate. Meanwhile, Jim feels uneasiness when he is attracted to his ex-best friend's ex- wife, even though he's married.The acting, as an ensemble, is well done. As I sort of said above, Brodrick and Witherspoon are great in satiric and compelling roles. The rest of the actors fit their role quite well too. Director Payne's direction is a little cheesy at first, but is really quite appropriate for the story as it moves along. There is also quite a few funny jokes and moments in the movie (my favorite is the end for Matthew's reaction to seeing Tracy in New York).If the movie has any flaws, its that it leaves you with a weird feeling at the end. Its not that it's a dark story, its just that everyone gets what they want in a way that's not exactly how it should have been (anyone who saw Sideways will know what I mean). Also, it's kind of pathetic to see Brodrick's character dive deeper into to his attempt for an adulterous affair that when everything happens as it does, you get that feeling of you should have seen it coming Jim towards him.Still, I recommend it for anyone who like intelligent stories and humor.

It's easy to see why. It's smart and intelligent as well as being very funny. It's a brilliant satire on the way American political campaigns are run and it's set in a high school. (It's probably more effective than many other political satires set in real seats of Government). Tracy Flick is the ambitious, (and ruthless), student running for student president. She has the brash confidence of someone convinced they are always right. She talks in clichés and quotes Thoreau. If she could put into practice some of the things she pulls from books she might actually make a half-decent leader but Tracy is oblivious to everything that is real and human and fallible. Tracy, in other words, is bad for people and the only person to see it is her teacher and it's his job to oversee the election.In these parts, Reece Witherspoon and Matthew Broderick are pitch-perfect. Witherspoon had yet to establish herself and Broderick's career had stalled. Election put both of them on track and I doubt if either of them has given a better performance. In this film Payne was honing that serio-comic tone that would come to fruition in Sideways but already he was proving a master at establishing mood and a brilliant director of actors. He is so good at the serious stuff, in fact, that you would like him to jettison the comedy altogether, though here you're glad he doesn't. This is laugh out loud funny. What it isn't is another American High School Comedy. File it next to Rushmore.

(It can't really dodge its hostility towards women by claiming to be seen from a fearful male's point of view--the narrative is driven by multiple voiceovers of both sexes.) Reese Witherspoon, who manages to retain her dignity even while director Alexander Payne shoots her in the most unflattering ways possible, stars as an ambitious senior running for class president who finds opposition from a genial jock (Chris Klein, playing essentially the same decent guy he would in the `American Pie' series) goaded on by a vindictive teacher (Matthew Broderick) and the jock's lesbian sister (Jessica Metzler), running on her own agenda. Payne brings a seemingly snappy irreverence towards his subject's surface, with a take-no-prisoners attitude about the pathetic little individuals he so detests, but he has the smarts to create a universe fraught with serious consequences that carries a power enough to unify an audience. The screenplay, by Payne and Jim Taylor, based on a novel by Tom Perrotta (unread), is witty, perceptive (in spite of its dismaying tendencies) and articulate; the ensemble acting is outstanding, especially Broderick's, whose recent endeavors find him becoming quite adept at finding challenging roles (in films such as this and `You Can Count On Me') that allow him to dig beneath his all-American charm and uncover some unexpectedly quirky truths about the characters he plays.

It would be sort of like making a film about how American Presidents tend to resemble monkeys obvious. Let's make no bones about this Election is twisted, bitter and it wants to bring everyone down with it. Every character that we encounter is a self-serving, morally corrupt charlatan. The only possible exception to this rule is Paul, Chris Klein's muddy brained jock, a guy who wouldn't know what ethics were if they jumped up and bit him on the cajones. He betrays a certain kind of idiotic innocence that makes him simply the least worst candidate for President, a criteria that has been used to elect many a President into the White House.Although the direction is not particularly unique it's very, very subtle and does a superb job of manipulating the audience's perceptions of each character by making them look... well... horrible. Who didn't want Matthew Broderick to take a fall after he got that ugly bee sting on his eye. I'm no fan of the guy, but his transformation from twee over-achiever to evil, adulterous wasp-stung warrior of doom is just brilliant.Likewise, the audience is encouraged to detest Dave Novotny after they see his ugly attempts to play Hendrix with Mr McAllister at the beginning of the film.

Erroneously perceived as a send-up of school politics, it's really an excoriating character portrait of a grown-up hypocrite.  Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick) initially appears to be the hero of this story, partly because his is the first narrative voice of the film, partly because of his clean-cut good looks, and mainly because his adversary, high school senior Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon), is irritatingly perky and ambitious.  Over the course of this brisk, unpredictable, and embarassingly well-observed film, McAllister is unmasked as a shallow, self-deluding, unreliable, and dishonourable man.  The beauty of the ending is that he never understands this, continuing to think of himself as a reasonable, sensitive, nurturing, and successful individual, despite all evidence to the contrary (like the shouts of asshole that follow his retreating back).  The likelihood that any man (like your humble reviewer) could bumble down the same path, led by horniness and hubris, merely multiplies the comic/horrific effect.Witherspoon is terrific -- I've rarely seen someone act so well with their nostrils -- and so is the rest of the cast.

These students usually have to be nudged when the final bell of the day rings so they know it's time to go home.Election, based on the novel by Tom Perrotta, adapted for the screen by Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor III, and directed by Payne, captures the high school experience better than any John Hughs film of the 1980's.  Don't get me wrong-Ferris Bueller's Day Off and The Breakfast Club were excellent films.  But Election was so close to reality it brought me back to my own late '70's and early '80's high school days.Election focuses on the over-achiever, Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon), and the history/civics teacher, Jim McAllister (Matthew Brodrick), who recognizes her for what she is the student who will stop at nothing to achieve that $125,000 a year job.  Motivated by his negative feelings for Flick, a crises in his own life, and revenge for an incident involving his best friend Dave Novotny (Mark Harelik) who was a teacher also, McAllister decides to gain revenge on student Flick using the student body presidential election.  I won't reveal what the incident was concerning Dave, but it is clear Tracy Flick is a stick, hell, a *bundle* of dynamite waiting to go off in the face of anyone who gets in her way.  What irritates McAllister most about Tracy Flick is her attitude of It's my way or the highway.Sucked into the whirlpool of McAllister and Flick's relationship is Paul Metzler (Chris Klein, in a role I could easily see Keanu Reeves playing 10 years ago), the well meaning, popular jock (an achiever) who has broken his leg in a skiing accident and needs a shot of self-esteem.  McAllister talks Paul into running for student body president against unopposed Flick. Further away from the revenge whirlpool but still an essential ingredient to unfolding events is Paul's adapted sister Tammy (Jessica Campbell), a young, under-achieving woman confused about her sexual orientation.  Tammy is severely emotionally hurt by a close girlfriend who she loves but does not respond in kind, and in fact is very unkind.  Downright mean, actually. The girlfriend is not lesbian and in an effort to reaffirm her own sexuality and hurt Tammy, she begins to date Paul.  Tammy, in an effort to hurt her and Paul, decides to run for student body president.  All of this comes as a surprise to Tracy Flick, who expected to run unopposed (and win by default).Reese Witherspoon is excellent as Tracy Flick.  She has a cute, radiant, affecting smile on the outside but has a drive and ambition with the weight of a steamroller on the inside.  When she purses her lips and squints her eyes in anger because something doesn't go her way, even the strongest of the strong get a shiver up the spine.  Matthew Brodrick is great as Jim McAllister, a good man with a simple way of looking at life (held in secret contempt by Tracy) who ends up making one or two bad judgment calls.The script is dark humored, extremely funny, and insightful.  Jim, speaking of his best friend Dave, remarks He became a high school teacher because he's one of those people who never wanted to leave high school in the first place.  The characters have depth and are complex.  I was also impressed by how the school facility was handled by the script.  They do not come off like clueless adults who are one step behind the students (as in most other high school films).  Rather, they are intelligent and mature, as demonstrated by Vice Principle Ron Bell (Matt Malloy).Payne's direction is stylish and he has a wonderful grasp on the narrative. He is very creative with the camera and exploits the visual, using freeze frames at key moments of character introduction with brief voice over narration, cutting to events in the past and returning to the original freeze frame when the intro is over.  Payne also uses the freeze frame technique at key plot moments like a writer uses an exclamation point.Election is an examination of what's really important in life.  In some ways, it reminded me of the high school version of American Beauty. Overall, Election is as sharp and real as they come.

He successfully broke the mystique of Mr. Clean Shaven. All aspects of unpleasantness, dirty, ugly, lowly tricks despised by society, he played it all in this Alexander Payne's snappy movie Election. You will not find a smartly dressed Broderick image -- it's heart of suburbia, and the unthinkable of situations happen to Jim McAllister (Broderick's character) in all sorts of embarrassing appearances with no apologies. He looks so comfortable in his role -- in spite of the fact that he goes through worse events than what Bill Murray did in Rushmore 1998.We're first introduced to Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon's character) and her spunky energy shines. Then we see McAllister (and don't forget the custodian that briefly appeared -- all characters, no matter how small, play an important part in the whole scheme of things), the teacher adored, the man who's in control of his own faculty. However, he has a certain grudge towards the all too confident image that Tracy Flick exudes, and here lies the seed of unkindness contrary to what McAllister stands for in the eyes of his students and peers (or us the audience for that matter).Writer-director (w-d) Alexander Payne delivered a story that is multi-layered and definitely not your ordinary teen flick. The tone of the movie feels like Mike Judge's Office Space 1999, there's a comic strip like quality to it. Yet it takes a responsible approach to the subject matters at hand and deliberate consideration shows through the sharp dialog and the various comical (painful farce) situations of Broderick's character. Yes, Payne manages to provide laughter throughout the movie. It is very entertaining.The two supporting characters, the Metzler brother and sister, Paul and Tammy, were aptly portrayed by Chris Klein and Jessica Campbell. The latter included display of lesbian inclinations. For more in-depth description of teenage sentiments in this category, try w-d Maria Maggenti's The Incredible True Adventure of Two Girls in Love 1995, or, more mature (non-teenage) portrayal, try w-d Patricia Rozema's When Night Is Falling 1995.Besides this movie, Witherspoon has another tour de force performance in w-d Matthew Bright's sharp modern day fable like film Freeway 1996, opposite Keifer Sutherland (NFE language and subject matter for mature audience).Broderick's counterpart Meg Ryan in Addicted to Love 1997, also has broken her sweet face romantic lead image in several films. She's a hooker in Hurlyburly 1998; a disheveled looking woman in an asylum in Restoration 1995; a brave wartime pilot in Courage Under Fire 1996; an alcoholic wife and mother opposite Andy Garcia in When a Man Loves a Woman 1994 -- a Luis Mandoke poignant film on co-dependency relationship.

This is why high school life has never truly undergone an appropriate cinema vision.  We either get The Substitute or High School High.  Either way, it's a sad collection of overdrawn clichés that don't work anymore.This is where Election drawns it's thin line.  Every character in this movie is a person (or persons) that you know.  We've all met a Tracy Flick, Paul Metzler, or had a teacher like Jim McAllister.  Although each character may be taken to extremes in this movie, you feel for them cause you know them.Hands down, Reese Witherspoon has proven herself an incredible actress. She can play all the roles she wants, without typecasting herself, be it school slut(Pleasantville), innocent virgin (Cruel Intentions), or, as Election shows, Conniving Overachiever.  This may be her best role yet as she makes you both hate and love Tracy.  You can't stand the fact that what would be typically a very flat character has so many levels to her.  It's so refreshing.Matthew Broderick is the most underrated actor of our time.  He needs recognition already!  And don't give me any of that Ferris Bueller and Glory stuff.  And don't mention Road to Wellville and Godzilla either. For such a horrible person as his character tries to be, you can't help but feel sorry for him because he fails at everything and you know that streak just isn't gonna stop.I will confess, I am a gifted student in my high school, and I know a lot of Tracy Flicks.  My classmates are Tracys.  My best friends are Tracys.n In fact, I'm a bit of a Tracy myself.  So this movie was so refreshing cause it was so accurate.  Right down to the clubs she was in.  And several of my teacher's are McAllister's too.  Giving all their time to the school and then getting nothing but gray hairs in return.  It's really quite sad.As for the writing and directing, I'm no expert, but the odd way of telling the story through 5 or 6 different character's and yet also from an omnipotent point of view, just may be the funniest thing ever.  What a work. Freeze frames, little notes on the screen, stock footage...I want to see more works like this.  This is great movie making at a new point of finesse.Bottom line is this school has never looked so real on the silver screen. MTV Films needs to stay independant and stay in the present (to avoid any 200 Ciggarettes disasters again).  I swear, this movie is practically a real life documentary.  Even the bathroom pass made of wood that Tracy has rings true.  At least to me.  But then again, exiting the movie you seem to learn something about morals and ethics.

But some decisions carry more weight than others. Election deals with the morals and ethics we try struggle with in our everyday lives in a way that causes us to truly reflect on our own decisions present and past. Alexander Payne has created a film that through great character development and the unraveling of a universally adult message becomes something that is both humorous and smart. Ultimately, it makes us understand what it takes to reach (or crush) a dream. What's the difference between morals and ethics? We are first introduced to Mr. McAllister (Matthew Broderick) as the teacher of his US History class as he is asking them this question. He struggles with the answer himself all the way through the final scene in the movie where he throws a slurpee at Tracy Flick's limousine in rage and bitter disgust. When we see Tracy Flick's (Reese Witherspoon) hand shoot up in the air in the classroom and hold it high as if she knows that no one can answer this question better than she can, we know we are in for a clashing of titans that can only end in disaster. Tracy is running for president, and is the kind of girl that is so over zealous and over motivated that it tends to make those around her who aren't, either hate her, or feel bad about themselves. We see both. Mr. McAllister has a loving wife and a modest job, but through a series of flashbacks where we see him teaching the same thing every single year, we begin to think that he is lying when he tells us he loves his job. He drives a small hatchback that looks like it probably ran him about a thousand dollars and came off the line in the early 70s. Immediately, he enlists Paul Metzler, (Chris Klein) the injured star quarterback to run against Tracy. He can't bear to see her get what she believes is her 'destiny' just because no one is opposing her. This underhanded partnership will bring to foresight Mr. McAllister's shadowed misogyny and deep unhappiness he has for his life. He along with others in the film will be forced to a moral and ethical crossroads of which the implications for the decision will undoubtedly be big. Tracy's other nemesis to world domination is Tammy Metzler (Jessica Campbell), Paul's sister, who is just running because her previous bi-curious girlfriend is just dating Paul to get back at her. She takes a stance during their auditorium speech that fuels the fire of moral decisions to the brink of ruin. She tells the whole assemble that she doesn't even care about the election, and that nobody should vote. This brings to light the true importance of school-run extra-curricular activates, and in foresight, even our modern day government. Who really has control and who are we supposed to think has control? What kind of social order are our schools teaching our students, and then how does this play out as we become adults? We see Tracy with a Nebraska senator near the end of the film, which really ties this line from a dysfunctional fake school organization to real life. Something that we, as CNN-watching Americans become unaware of too quickly. Because of this hotbed of events, each character is set out to confront a moral dilemma. This is set up at the beginning, because we hear about Dave Novotny, (Mark Harelik) a teacher who flew too close to the sun on wings of an underage student (Tracy) and ultimately lost his job and family. Tammy must decide between allowing Tracy to win and ultimately causing her brother to lose, or creating her own happiness by taking credit for Tracy's sabotage of Paul and getting herself expelled. Paul, the overly nice, innocent jock must decide between voting for himself, which will win him the election but he believes it is 'wrong'; or voting for Tracy, which will lose him the election but he believes it is right. Tracy must choose between stepping on everyone around her to accomplish her dreams, or risk being number two. And Mr. McAllister must risk losing his job and family for something that 'feels' right to him, or do what he knows is right and continue with his mundane existence. All very difficult decisions for our not-so-simpleton Nebraska high school. Payne puts a magnifying glass and a jury to the decisions we make everyday and the people they effect. Election will make you laugh and cringe, because it is so dark and goes so deep into the insides of what our own lives may very well be like, and ultimately how that translates into how we live and what decisions we are constantly confronted with in life. You will see moments of yourself in one of the broad spectrum of characters, and ultimately contemplate your own drive and what lines you set or cross to get where you are going.

This is an intelligent, witty and scathing assault on high school presidential elections. Its got a wonderful cast. Superb direction by Alexander Payne. And a very clever, masterful screenplay to work from. This is how teen movies should be made.Not since the days of John Hughes have I seen a teen film so astute. Election is a film that is scarily realistic about the inner workings of the high school caste system. And Payne has an imaginatively assembled cast to carry the film off with aplomb.One of the most inspired touches to Election is the fact that Ferris Bueller himself, Matthew Broderick plays the part of a teacher. It seems that Ferris has gone from skiving off school to teaching at one! Broderick plays Jim McAllister, a popular civics teacher at Carver High. He seems an affable chap who gets along great with the students. Well, except for one.There is one student in Jim's class who really gets under his skin. And she's a nightmare from the moment you set eyes on her! Tracy Flick, the next in line to be class president. And she's brought brilliantly to life by Reese Witherspoon.Tracy is one of these ambitious, eager overachievers. People who are so full of the greatest intentions. And a bit full of themselves at the same time! She's bright, perky and very assured. She's also pushy, manipulative and a monumental pain in the arse!Jim can't stand her. And for more than one reason. Jim's best friend, Dave Novotny (Mark Harelik) used to be a teacher at Carver High. But he made the rather questionable decision of initiating a quiet relationship with Tracy. She returned his advances, but then turned him in to the school board.Tracy got off scot-free, and Dave's reputation was destroyed. He never taught in a high school again. Jim knows that Tracy is not the picture of innocence she makes herself out to be. And when she enters the student presidential election unopposed, Jim doesn't want her to win. Not only because of what she did to Dave, but if she wins, it means Jim will have to spend more time with her. And if he does, he may wind up sharing Dave's fate. Doesn't say much for his willpower does it?!So Jim sets a plan in motion. Paul Meztler (Chris Klein) was a former high school jock. Captain of the high school football team, he was big man on campus until a skiing accident ruined his leg, and put an end to any more footballing. Jim convinces Paul to enter the running and play on a sympathy vote from the students, which will throw a spanner in the works for Tracy's campaign.But there are unforeseen complications. Paul's lesbian sister enters the election too out of sheer spite, when her bisexual girlfriend left her for Paul! This only serves to make Tracy even more determined to win, leading her ambitions to become more and more crazed. And Jim's carefully calculated plan slowly begins to unravel.I can't begin to tell you what a pleasure it was to sit through Election. Everything about the film feels so right. Not only the writing and the sharply acute dialogue, but every actor suits their character right down to a tee.Reese Witherspoon has always been an intelligent performer to me. And she has seldom been better in anything else. She may have won an Academy Award for Walk the Line, but her performance as Tracy Flick is just as Oscar worthy.Witherspoon doesn't so much play the part. She embodies it. She walks around the set with a dominant personality hidden behind a faintly aggressive pleasant demeanour. One of these insufferable teenagers who firmly believe that what's best for them is best for everyone. Tracy speaks in upper case. Her gaze is never short of penetrating. She has an endless supply of put downs, insults and veiled threats. And Witherspoon pulls it all together with style and grace. Its a criminally overlooked performance on her resume.Matthew Broderick is equally impressive. It seems that with Election, Ferris Bueller has finally grown up. And although he plays Jim as a decent guy, he has his flaws. He must have a bit of a petty streak otherwise he wouldn't want to scupper a straight A student's ambitions to be class president. And he cheats on his wife too. You can certainly sympathise with Jim at times. But he's not always likable.Alexander Payne has directed a really outstanding teen film. The way it highlights the evils and backstabbing that forms the sinister underbelly of the US public school system is right on target. His films are always true to life. Something he would recapture in his following film, the superb About Schmidt.And the ending is terrific. Its not at all what you are expecting. There are no clichéd moralistic speeches. No good triumphing over evil. No we see some ugly sides to human natures in this film. And there's no cop-out ending either. There's that all too important residue of realism to Tracy and Jim's fates and futures.A superior teen film of the genre. And I really like the film's moral.

While most of the male characters have weaknesses (like Jim, the teacher) some of the men, like the principal, are purposeful. In the end, it is the janitor and two male students that bring Jim down. The women have strength which Jim admires and fears- much as he both admires and fears Tracy. It's never explained why Linda changes her mind about Jim, turns to his wife, and claims he took advantage of her loneliness. Women in this movie use their power to destroy. Linda destroys Jim's marriage she didn't have to tell his wife about Jim's waiting for her at the motel (a meeting that she suggested in the morning, following his clumsy suggestion made days earlier). Tracy and her mother destroy the geometry teacher's career and his marriage, although he said he loved Tracy. Tracy and Linda reject the men's love, watch while the men's lives crash around them, and emerge from the scandals undamaged and unregretful, speaking of their admirers callously. Even Lisa turns on her ex-lesbian lover Tammy, deliberately sleeping with Tammy's brother Paul. Tammy reacts by trying to hurt Lisa by running her own campaign for student body president, becoming competition for Paul. She then wrecks Jim's attempt to make Tracy account for her actions. The only leading male character who isn't devastated by women is Paul. Lisa ultimately hooks up with one of his football buddies, but his good nature keeps him from being broken hearted by her or by Tammy's hostility. He votes for Tracy, believing it isn't morally right to vote for himself in the election, and his vote causes Tracy to win. Ultimately his kindness costs him the election. He says his senior year was wonderful and he's happy, but is he? The only people who seem to end up truly happy at the end of the film are Tammy, who has found a new girlfriend, and Tracy both appear satisfied that the ends justified the means for them to arrive at the schools they wanted and the relationships they are perusing. Election is a witty comedy, but these undertones suggest that it's not just Tracy who should be brought down a peg, and discouraged from stepping on others in her race to realise her desires and dreams.

I went back to review Citizen Ruth and About Schmitt, and found myself amazed in the subtle execution of loss and despair in the stories and characters. Alexander Payne has a good thing going in his work.In Citizen Ruth, Election and About Schmidt we perhaps have a trilogy that arcs through the life cycle of a human being..Citizen Ruth...conception, birth and childhood.Ruth seems to embody all three...physically and emotionally (pregnant, but child-like in mind and action). The subtle sub-plots involving the child of Life Savers Norm and Gail Stoney (played by Sebastian Anzaldo III) is possibly the saddest depiction of a loss of innocence I have ever seen in a film, worthy of Stanley Kubrick (who filmed a similar theme in the first half of Full Metal Jacket). When Ruth hits the child, suddenly the wind is also knocked out of the film. The illusion of choice in the conception and birth process of mortal existence is all over this film.Election...youth and the middle aged...The youth struggle to grow up and the middle aged reach for a happiness lost in youth. I think Reese Witherspoon's character, Tracy Flick, goes through a steep learning curve, a process of change and understanding that benefits her and helps her come to terms with her loneliness, however damaged she may still be. She actually comes out better than the other characters IMO. Mr. McCallister, in contrast, spirals out of control...his inner creepy crawlies, hidden in the dark corners of a classroom for years, are suddenly brought out by the searing light of Tracy Flick.About Schmidt...old age and death.Regrets and redemption by proxy (the best gifts can be given and received in ways that we can never imagine...without us even knowing about it). Death is seen quite early in the film...and the bell tolls for Warren's life(as the clock strikes 5pm to announce Warren's retirement). While Warren is going through crisis and he desperately tries to make a difference by saving his daughter from marrying a loser, a 6 year old child in Africa is deeply affected by Warren's $22 a month donation. Warren is redeemed? I think Warren is redeemed after his Wedding reception speech earlier...it is also his burial...his last will and testament. The 6 year child's drawing is a sign that the circle of life will begin again...brand spanking' new.These films are so amazing I feel as if I'm participating in each. Great cinema.

After Tracy postulates for president, Mr. M presents another student for president Paul Metzler. After this, Paul's sister, Tammy, postulates for president too. That's because she wants to revenge from Paul since he's dating Lisa, the girl that Tammy loves. So, what started as a simple election finishes as a real battle; and Mr. Mc Callister life finishes ruin after trying to cheat on his wife, Diane. Great satire about power relations. Great performances by Matthew Broderick as Jim Mc Callister and Reese Witherspoon as the neurotic Tracy Flick (She deserved a nomination to the Golden Globe as Best Actress in a movie Comedy/ Musical in 2000 for this role).

I was more than pleasantly surprised at what a smart and highly original black comedy this was. Reese Witherspoon gives a razor sharp performance as Tracy Flick, an over achieving high schooler who plans to run for student body president unopposed until a faculty member persuades the school football captain to run against her. To say much more would just give away too many of the delightful twists and turns this story takes. Suffice it to say that the journey is more than worth it in this smart and stylish black comedy that holds surprises at every turn. Matthew Broderick, in a refreshing change of pace, scores a bullseye as the faculty member, who turns out to have a dark side you don't see coming and Chris Klein makes the most of his role as jock turned politician. Attention must be paid here and if you think you know what's going to happen, you're probably wrong and should just keep watching. A minor classic that is worth repeated viewings.

(It can't really dodge its hostility towards women by claiming to be seen from a fearful male's point of view--the narrative is driven by multiple voiceovers of both sexes.) Reese Witherspoon, who manages to retain her dignity even while director Alexander Payne shoots her in the most unflattering ways possible, stars as an ambitious senior running for class president who finds opposition from a genial jock (Chris Klein, playing essentially the same decent guy he would in the `American Pie' series) goaded on by a vindictive teacher (Matthew Broderick) and the jock's lesbian sister (Jessica Metzler), running on her own agenda. Payne brings a seemingly snappy irreverence towards his subject's surface, with a take-no-prisoners attitude about the pathetic little individuals he so detests, but he has the smarts to create a universe fraught with serious consequences that carries a power enough to unify an audience. The screenplay, by Payne and Jim Taylor, based on a novel by Tom Perrotta (unread by this reviewer), is witty, perceptive (in spite of its dismaying tendencies) and articulate; the ensemble acting is outstanding, especially Broderick's, whose recent endeavors find him becoming quite adept at finding challenging roles (in films such as this and `You Can Count On Me') that allow him to dig beneath his all-American charm and uncover some unexpectedly quirky truths about the characters he plays.

In an institution as authoritarian as the average American high school, elections for the student body are exercises in tokenism. This doesn't stop one Tracey Flick (Reese Witherspoon)  from putting her all into getting elected president. She has some competition from a dim jock, Paul Metzler (Chris Klein), who is put up to it by teacher Jim Macalister (Matthew Broderick). Macalister wants to revenge his former colleague Novotny who fell foul of Tracey's charms and was dismissed but instead he gets himself into lots of trouble.Good dialogue, a fast pace and a cynical attitude help to make this an effective satire. Political correctness is seen as just another way of keeping people in line, and when it is incovenient it is ignored. When Metzler's lesbian sister decides to run in the election on an anti-authority platform the principal immediately suspends her for no good reason. The school, named for a distinguished Afro-American agricultural scientist, George Washington Carver, has hardly a black in the place (though this is Nebraska). Clever use of voice-over from several characters rounds out the storyline nicely. The eternally sunny weather is faintly menacing, somehow. The only weak point was the ending, something of an anti-climax I thought.Reese Witherspoon plays Tracey the human tornado with just the right amount of occasional hesitation to remind us there is a human being inside there somewhere. Matthew Broderick as the teacher sucked in by her vortex makes his character's predicament look inevitable. Chris Klein (in his first role - he was `discovered' for this film) has a downhome Keanu Reeves style just right for the part.  He and the director Alexander Payne both come from Omaha, Nebraska, which was used for location shooting, though I don't think the Chamber of Commerce will be inviting them back. Middle America comes across as a pretty tightly buttoned-down place with not a lot of tolerance for odd-balls.Anyway, it's refreshing to see a high school comedy with verve and bite, and a good antidote to `American Pie', in which Chris Klein also appears in a paler copy of his role here. This film has some parallels with another school comedy `Rushmore' but here the satire is sharper and the story more absorbing.

Broderick plays Jim McAllister, an earnest and well-meaning teacher who is responsible for overseeing the campaign, while Witherspoon is Tracey Flick, the whiney, over-achieving and over-zealous frontrunner who always - much to McAllister's dismay - gets everything her own way. And so, McAllister recruits the injured star of the school football team (Paul Metzler, played by Chris Klein) to run against her. Metzler is then himself challenged by his own sister Tammy (Jessica Campbell), who wants revenge against him because she feels he stole away from her the girl that she was in love with. Related to all this is the account of the devastating impact all these shenanigans have on McAlister's personal life.Overall I liked this movie. The subplot around McAlister's troubled marriage was a part of that dark dimension I spoke of earlier, and added a serious touch to an otherwise rather silly story. There was also an ongoing and thought-provoking issue of the consequences that have to be faced when people abuse their authority and take advantage of those who are more vulnerable. In a sense, I guess, that has partly to do with why I only rate this movie a 6/10. I found it difficult to really like a movie that used an affair between a high school teacher (Dave Novotny, played by Mark Harelik) and a sophomore high school student (Witherspoon's character, who as a sophomore would have been 14 or 15?) as the opening to a comedy. I'm sure the intention wasn't to take such things lightly, but I thought the whole thing was a little bit in bad taste.Setting that aside, though, Election is an enjoyable enough movie. "},{"Title":"Another 'youth' movie co-opted for middle-aged angst.","Date":"4 October 1999","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  The problem with films like HEATHERS, which purported at last to give an undiluted approximation of teenage experience, was that they were afraid to go all the way.  Nihilistic energy and rebellious apathy, say, was allowed to be amusing, but never defining it was something we grow out of.  This was patronising and offensive, and the way such films had a hidden, moral, 'parental' agenda was a complete betrayal of those for whom they presumed to speak.   HEATHERS is a fun film, but it leaves a nasty taste in the mouth - and I'm not talking about the murder spree.Lately, though, films have come along, which, like  LES 400 COUPS, relate adolescent experience from an adolescent point of view, coloured by an adolescent framework.  This is not to say the films aren't adult or complex, it's just that the grown-ups' memories have not a mocking 'mature' commentary undermining them.  RUSHMORE is the most obvious example, although SOUTH PARK is perhaps the idea's apotheosis.All of this is by way of saying that ELECTION seemed to be continuing this trend.  We are offered four voiceovers - four points of views - which leads us to expect a splintered, cubist view of experience, an unloaded battle between youth and authority as well as youth against youth (much more dramatic).  Unfortunately, there aren't really four points of view at all, just one - that of a self-righteous, feckless loser of an Ethics teacher (although the irony of having former youth star Matthew Broderick playing him is very funny).  For all its youthful sheen and energy, this is yet another white man's mid-life crisis.This is all the more surprising considering the film was made by MTV. There was a lot of sneering at this, as if the film would be just a glorified pop-video, filled with no-brainer tricks.  As it is, ELECTION is funnier, more clever and better made than most of the rubbish churned out contemptuously by major and indie alike this year.  The main problem is that the style isn't worked out properly.  The film fairly bounces along, with day-glo sets, stylised performances and dialogue, smart, oblique situations, breezy pacing, funny editing, sketch-like construction, odd camera angles. This is perfectly in keeping with a film about adolescent crises, but surely not with the story of a burned-out, washed-up, frustrated failure.  It could be argued that the style represents manic youth impinging  on his life, but the fact is that his problems have nothing (directly) to do with his pupils - they are the archetypal traumas of a man his age.ELECTION is still a very enjoyable film.  The individual teenagers are a clever microcosm of America, with the go-getters doing well, but the dorky rich kids doing just fine too.  The figure of Paul is the (unscathed) object of the film's best satire - he is the archetypal football jock - rich popular, an absolute idiot, who takes everything in his beaming, moronic stride, knowing that everything's going to be just dandy, whatever setbacks pop up.  He is such a braindead goofball, you revel in Tracy's every attempt to thwart him - better the hard-working go-getter than the smug parasite.She's a bit frightening too, though, and it's typical of the film's older male bias that she's plainly a caricature, only saved by Reece Witherspoon's brilliant observation of the neurosis, fear and anxiety behind the brittle confidence.  The story of Paul's sister is the film's most appealing and moving, a rare case of an actual human being getting through the net, although we could have done with more of her.ELECTION is quite clever on politics too, on the overwhelming, yet perfectly understandable, even admirable apathy of a generation.  Tracy's new conservatism is a joyless Orwellian horror, while the smug liberalism of Mr. M. (surely a nod to Fritz Lang's study of the corruption of childhood) is an ineffective fraud.  The film is quite bleak about modern US politics; there is a brilliant running metaphor concerning rubbish and votes, about the confusion in the US between signs and signifiers, that says more about contemporary America than a thousand self-satisfied BOB ROBERTS' ever could. Still, a disappointment.

It isn't absolutely a presidential or legislative election. Simply, this election takes place in an American high school and it must elect a student for the following role the president's board of the students. This is what Reese Witherspoon would like to become and she stands in this election. But one of his teachers, Matthew Broderick isn't prepared to accept that and in order to stand in her way, he asks one of his students, Chris Klein to stand fin the election. Broderick asked him to do this because he knows that Klein is very appreciated in the high school for his good mood and his happiness. And so, things get hard... It's obvious that Klein hasn't got Witherspoon's ambitions. He comes from a wealthy family and aspires to a quiet and idle life. Whereas Tammy Metzler, Klein's sister, well it's more in an idea of revenge and jealousy against her brother (he unvoluntarily charmed Metzler's lover who is a lesbian) that she applies for being president.Election is, of course a satiric comedy that deregulates the bases of an election. All in all, people and especially teenagers don't get interested in it because it brings nothing to their lives. It inspires them indifference and boredom, the same feelings that shine the Americans towards the political life. When Witherspoon and Klein are making their speeches (that use all the processes of the rhetoric. like political men, they're talking for saying nothing) in front of the pupils, these ones are laughing at them whereas Tammy's one provokes their happiness and enthusiasm because it's all the contrary of a banal speech. Moreover, Klein will prefer to vote for Witherspoon rather than him, this last one will find out before the verdict in front of the pupils that she won. Due to this, Matthew Broderick will try to unsettle the election's final results. As far as Matthew Broderick is concerned, well we can say that this election is the beginning of the end for him Witherspoon's despising him, he can't distinguish his private and professionnal life any more and his real intentions towards Witherspoon will earn him the personal's hate and his departure from the high school. Reese Witherspoon is really talented and her character doesn't really attract the liking. Moreover, Alexander Payne tries to underline his ambitious side by making her ridiculous (her speech of candidature is ridiculous. She should conclude that no matter the way we take, we always find obstacles and nothing's far from certain. So at the end, it would be difficult to find a negative point to this comedy and however, I found one it remains to deplore the vulgar and heavy side of the comedy which is nearly common in American comic films.

But it fails to do anything on any dramatic level.  On paper, it seems full of drama; many characters have their lives turned upside down, there is revenge, forbidden love, and ruthless ambition.  But it all seemed boring to me.  I'm not sure why, but I couldn't really connect to any of the characters.  They did whatever they felt like doing and had no qualms about doing it, they only worried about being caught.  They seemed ultimately without the moral conflict (ironicly considering several scenes where the class discusses ethics) that even Michael Corleone had to wrestle with. Nor were they amoral in an interesting, frightening way, like Hannibal Lector. It was basically like watching five-year-olds fight over toys.  I simply couldn't bring myself to care what happened to any of the main characters (only Tammy's storyline had any emotional impact), even a little bit.

By making the usually sympathetic protagonist unsympathetic by the end, and the standard antagonist the more sympathetic one, Election manages to put our heart to sleep, while forcing us to watch it with our eyes and minds, but the problem is the eyes ultimately dupe the mind into believing that we are watching something worthwhile; only if one dutifully thinks about the film later, can one come to some conclusions regarding what it's actually trying to say, and how many people are willing and able to do that? The truth is they shouldn't have to.Election is really about two things, it's about Jim MacAlister's downfall due to an unethical decision, and Ms. Flicks ascendant victory. What Election is really about is the impotent man, but it fails as a film for several reasons. In making the antagonist so sympathetic, Mr. Payne may have launched Mrs.Whitherspoon's acting career, but he did not do much for his film. I personally was confused after the first viewing about who the protagonist actually was. And since in the film Mr. MacAlister's downfall has only a tenuous, at best, cause and effect relationship to Ms. Flicks triumph, with no real cause and effect at all, only correlation, the film does not manage to cast even slightest glaze of irony on her victory.A classical definition of a comedy is not that it has to be funny, but that it end well. A closer look at this film would reveal that it is neither a comedy nor a tragedy, but a hybrid of both. Although this film professes to be a comedy, there are few laughs, and we have to question if the film fulfills that promise by ending happily. Clearly Payne Suggests that all does not end well for Jim McAllister, and the film, at best, ends with murky tones.It is somewhat ironic that Mr. MacAlister gets what is implied by the director essentially the shaft in the end. In making him so sympathetic throughout the film it sets up somewhat other expectations for this character, whom Broderick's persona infuses with the utmost sympathy. Tracy, on the other hand, who has been an annoyance throughout the entire film, ends up ascendantly triumphant, despite this. It is a strange strategy for a filmmaker to employ these constructs. More than anything, the film confuses with an unclear central message. Film Critic Chuck Rudolph goes to write Exposes the dullards who praise it as the very suckers who promote the divisions among people under the pretense of virtuous moral insight. And that's the problem with Election, at the end it comes off as a film which tries to say something positive, but in fact is attempting to say something in the negative sense. We want to see someone, anyone, learn a lesson by the end of the film, and we don't. There are no character arcs in this film. I won't be the one to steadfastly quote and stay within the rules and confines that are considered correct narrative; the stuff they teach you in film school, but if a film doesn't work for me, I find it instinctively useful to look at the rules which govern classical drama for guidance.Beneath all of its veneer Election has no core or soul, at its weak heart it is just pure entertainment. And the real message of the film, if you care to look that deeply, is that the most soul cringing myopia and anality can pay off, big time, if the stars line up correctly. This film, which is so plot driven, has to know exactly where it is going; no amount of visual stylings and visual nuance can make up for lack of insight in that direction. One can imagine it playing differently and better in the book were some different laws of narrative can come into effect. Nine out of ten critics thought well of this film, although it is certain that the film did not reach its expectations at the box office. The emperor's new clothes have taken on a new meaning; this time, instead of being just completely naked, what a few of us see, finally, is a warped aneuploid character that is a bit uglier than a vague-vain human form. Such are the mechanics of our art, and the ironic times we are living in. I think, though, that a general feeling might get through to some that, simply, all is not well in the landscape of America, even if the audience are not exactly sure what the reasons are... But most probably, I consider, the one question that will be lingering in their minds while leaving the theater is the same question that Jim MacAlister asks us at the end of the film, ...And what is she doing in that Limo?

The stock high school comedy characters all all here; the hyperactive know it all student, the dumb quarterback, the moody depressed teen, the nerds, the creepy teacher. At first I found it hilarious that the teacher's face would be the one crumpled up in tears (and there is a great bit of misdirection with the loopy handwritten love note), but also surprising that the roles had been reversed and the adult had becomes the perceived victim (later we learn that Dave was a frequent bed wetter, even more prominently displaying this theme). But we trust what is supposedly Broderick's character, the good natured history teacher Jim, because his voice-over sounds so soothing, so mature. The slight of hand is gradual. Opposing him we have the bane of every teacher's existence, the enthusiastic Tracy Enid Flick, who busts up and down and on the spot at every question, hand firmly thrust up in the air. As if that was not annoying enough, it's even suggested that Jim blames her for seducing his former best friend, and is anxious that he is her next target, which is visualised by these seductive whispers in his mind, and speaks a lot more of him than her. Another technique that Payne likes to use is the sudden freeze frame, which warps Tracy's facial mannerisms into something ugly and demeaning, no doubt the same process that is churning away in Jim's mind, and dismissed her speech. Reese Witherspoon's performance is perfect - she toes the line between enthusiastic and annoying, but that line itself is warped from Broderick's perspective, and little actions become large annoyances. The screenplay is based on Tom Perrotta's novel, but Payne's vision is so much more appropriate for showing us just how lively these characters are. When Tracy first discovers Paul's campaign for student council, the soundtrack flares up like some Spaghetti Western with Morricone's Navajo Joe, and it is clear just how little she is used to being challenged, and Witherspoon's voice-over and the music both speed up in intensity as her angers grows. The same soundtrack later slows to a grinding halt as Jim proposes the widow Linda, and we like her are incredulous that our good guy image has been shattered. Broderick's stupid little grin is telling; he shoots for the little pleasures, and daydreams incessantly - in a green-screen sequence, he imagines himself driving a luxury Italian car, before the graceful backing track stops as he steps out onto the school parking lot. And on the pivotal election day, the music is once again key, the slow beats of the bass drum providing tension that would not be out of place before a large scale battle in some war film. Tracy seems to think so. We have the naivety of the teenagers pronounced via voice-over, with a complete sincerity that makes it funny but also a bit sad; Tracy insisting that she does not miss a father figure before perfectly describing one in Dave, Tammy musing on how she's not a lesbian even though every single one of her love interests have been female, Paul's various good natured ramblings about others and the gift of his penis...and of course his monotone, face- down speech delivered without an ounce of showmanship that Tracy possesses, but which Jim eagerly applauds anyway. And after it all? He is barely affected by the whole ordeal and has an awesome senior year. An early scene has Jim absent-mindedly tossing the food of his colleagues out of the teacher's fridge, with even less care for where it lands, splattering sauce onto the floor as the janitor shakes his head. Later, the same janitor is part of the visual assault on Jim as the cuts between their dead-straight stares speedily bore into Jim's conscience. Election's triumph is that it almost manages to make us feel a little for him; the breakdown of his marriage, the bee sting, the fury at Tracy's little celebration victory dance. And as he narrates his new life at the close, his happiness at being an educator, the new woman, and the modest yet lovable apartment, we think he is well adjusted, and content, and we are instinctively drawn to movie endings like this one. And he almost manages to fool us with his voice-over, his disappearance of contempt for Tracy Enid Flick. And for what? For tearing down a poster and denying it? For aiming further and higher than Jim will ever experience? His crusade becomes so sad and funny as he flees the scene, but I'm sure in his mind he has won.

The ending is so bleak that for me it dwarfs all those funny moments that had been established previously. Although bleak and contradicting, the movie depicts characters in extreme sides which sometimes are found in real life; the over achiever who turns out to be a friendless person, the responsible teacher who sometimes also falls into the pits of temptations, the kind person who is often clueless of life itself, and also the one who becomes a rebel after a rejection. The acting overall is a neat job. All the actors can portray their characters to the needed hyperbole. Matthew Broderick's simpleton acting gives good life to his character. Reese Witherspoon's overachiever character fits right to her face.

Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick) is the conscientious civics teacher. His best friend and fellow teacher Dave Novotny gets into serious trouble having an affair with Tracy.

Jim convinces rich popular football player Paul Metzler (Chris Klein) to run against her after his injury sidelines him. Paul's sister Tammy gets too obsessed with girlfriend Lisa. Lisa breaks up with her by having sex with Paul. That drives Tammy to run in the election against her older brother.This is a hilarious black comedy from Alexander Payne. Reese is so aggressively aggressive. She is absolutely brilliant. Chris Klein is also funny as the clueless jock. Broderick is sometimes on and off. He's not quite as funny in comparison. He's more in the pathetic area. I prefer the hilarity of the younger kids.

One particular scene highlights one of the teacher's lessons as he tries to squeeze out the students's idea of morals and ethics. Perhaps an early insight into Alexander Payne's screen writing style, Election will look to test these ideas and how humanity uses them in practice. The backdrop for this basis is a student body election that will determine the next student council president. The early candidate is the ambitious Tracy Flick (Witherspoon), who will stop at nothing to guarantee a bright future. In charge of the election is Mr. McAllister (Broderick), who resents Tracy for getting his colleague and friend fired due to an inappropriate relationship. Given his sour feelings, McAllister will persuade a popular jock named Paul Metzler (Klein) to run against Tracy in an attempt to get revenge for his friend. From then on, madness will ensue as McAllister experiences work and family problems and Tracy deals with the challenge of having competition.Election is, in essence, an exercise of how a human being acts in order to achieve what they rightfully believe is the common good. The dynamic of the movie is mostly supported in the head-to-head between Tracy and Mr. McAllister, but also with other characters. In the end, both of them end up being completely misguided in their actions. With that being said, it's the movie's ending that confuses me the most. I must warn you here that this final analysis of the movie may lead you to predict the conclusion of the referred film, and if so, you probably should stop reading here. Continuing with the review, by the movie's wrap up, it seems that, despite everything that happened, all our characters seem to have surpassed this simple school election, and are now living the lives they planned for themselves. Although it doesn't necessarily spell out if they're truly happy, it feels kind of weird that the message I get from this story is that if you do something wrong, you'll end up being fine, something that I don't entirely believe, after completing this movie. Give it a try, and see what kind of ideas you get from it.Rating 8/10 "},{"Title":"Gimme More Posters","Date":"2 January 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" Well, I must admit this is one of the BEST movies I've ever seen. Election is a extremely well made films for plenty of reasons. The story is miracle well written; all the characters are smart and unique their own ways. Tracy is a decisive girl who seems to be doing almost anything to reach her plans. I don't think the writers portrayed her in a bad and dishonest way; they showed that she is able to achieve what she wants, despite the loneliness it may cause. It's up to you to consider if her way of being is good or bad-- in my point of view, it's good, since I tend to much like her in some aspects. The movie doesn't really try to show who is the right person on the story. In fact, there is no right person; everybody has their own opinion and are free to do what they feel like doing. Furthermore, the movie is filled with many funny scenes, such as the speech, the confession, the paid holidays and the limousine attack. For some moments, I noticed this picture has some similarities with 1997's In & Out, given that both movies are ironical, smart and funny. This is surely very different from all the dumb high school movies you've repeatedly seen out there! Alexander Payne really surprised me and I'm looking forward to seeing other of his works.

The story, the characters, the humor, the soundtrack, everything and everyone seemed to be so perfectly in place, I just couldn't get enough of it. Of course, at some point, I stopped watching it - there's other films, too, you know. Now I watch it every once in a while, and it remains a great film. Recently, I've seen it with the audio commentary from director Alexander Payne, which was a lot of fun. I can hardly believe that, during all the times I've watched it, I hadn't noticed that there was só much garbage in it...I also hadn't realized that so much thought and effort had gone into the authentic (Nebraska) settings, the clothing, the use of a high school with actual students, the 'interludes' (like the typing of all the newspaper articles by Payne himself) and the 8 dollar haircut for Matthew Broderick. All of this contributes to this labor of love that truly shines, be it that it shines its light mostly on some darker matters of The American Way(s). I did however, before hearing the commentary, figure out that the bees were very likely digital. And just now I found out that bee sting is also a slang word which is even in a way appropriate for 'Election'...The story is so cleverly built up that it is over before you know it. There are several main characters (although Broderick and Reese Witherspoon lead), with loads of voice-overs, so I can warn you that keeping up with all that is key. But - if hopefully you liked it - you can always watch it again... and again, and again. At some point I have seen this film just too many times to be able to enjoy as much as I did the first times, but to defraud 'Election' of any points for that reason alone, would simply be... a travesty!

However it takes place in a high school, but that's certainly not who the satirical jabs are aimed at. The brilliance of Payne's work is how he is able to place a political message into such a bizarre context such as high school. Having Matthew Broderick and Reese Witherspoon as the leads doesn't hinder things either. There is a youthful, kinetic energy about this movie that is refreshingly original, if a bit overplayed at times.

Witherspoon plays Tracy, a perky, smart, goody-two-shoes who is running -- unopposed -- for class president. Broderick plays a high school teacher, Jim McAllister, whose best friend's life was trashed when it was exposed that he slept with Tracy. McAllister doesn't like her. At all. He encourages the star football player, Paul Metzler (Chris Klein) to oppose Tracy in the race, and then Paul's gay sister (Jessica Campbell) decides to run as well. McAllister's involvement and obsession with bringing Tracy down soon begins to affect his life negatively as interest in her did his friend.Good satire, with excellent performances by Broderick and Witherspoon, both in his/her own way deeply unlikable. Witherspoon's Tracy does have moments that show us that her overachievement has cost her friends, and she's a lonely girl for it. Broderick is very good as well as a slime of a teacher, who goes too far in his plot. The rest of the characters are stereotypical.There isn't a particular moral to the story except that the best candidate doesn't always win the election; it's the one who plays the game and is the biggest sleaze. And the movie couldn't have been timed better - we were faced the next year with the hanging chad debacle. Where was Matthew Broderick when we needed him.

Its all the more amazing when such a movie deserves such critical attention without succumbing to the obvious explicities of nudity, violence or drug use. Election, after all isn't about youthful indiscretions, it's a referendum on good 'ol American values like fidelity, democracy and Ferris Bueller.Mr. McAllister (Matthew Broderick) is a civics teacher at a suburban Omaha high school who aspires to be the best educator he can be. He has a loving wife, contributes to his community and commands a room full of precocious learners. Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) the class know-it-all however, may be a bit too precocious for his taste. While Tracy at first runs unopposed for student council President, McAllister recruits well-meaning jock Paul Metzler (Chris Klein) to act as a cog in her political machine. Things however start to get complicated when McAllister's personal life begins to unravel and Paul's sister Tammy (Jessica Campbell) jumps into the race.The characters from the original book Election written by Tom Perrotta were originally composites on the personalities of the 1992 presidential election. It translates slightly but each actor makes their part their own. The story is told from the multiple perspectives of its principle cast which stuffs the film's script with more irony than the phrase democratic republic. They each have significant flaws that make them unlikable yet fun to watch. Witherspoon's Tracy is especially enjoyable to see as she vigorously pursues her goals to the point of fanaticism. Broderick likewise shows his acting chops playing an anti-hero whose actions become increasingly more loathsome.There are tiny details in certain films that create a richness that, if nonexistent would be sorely missed. For 1999's Election, it's the score provided by Rolfe Kent. It punctuates important moments and highlights subtle frictions between characters often to hilarious effect. The moment Tracy finds out about Paul's candidacy the sounds of tribal chanting and shrieking is heard in the background as her face turns into a glaring scowl.I thoroughly enjoyed watching Election. The acting is top notch, the satire has a marvelous way of taking pot-shots at every sacred cow it can, and the details director Alexander Payne inserts are as poignant as they are rib tickling.http//theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Clever, satirical black comedy about high school and politics.","Date":"1 July 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" A little gem clearly meant to be a sleeper hit (it's much too quirky and clever to be classified alongside mainstream efforts), Alexander Payne's ELECTION takes a neat concept for a high school comedy and turns it into a sly, cynical look at current politics. And with great performances, sharp comedic dialogue, and a neat premise, you just can't help but love it.Reese Witherspoon (in a spunky enjoyable performance) plays the over-achieving and slightly obnoxious know-it-all Tracy Fink, who is the fore-runner for the candidacy for student council president. This social studies teacher Jim McCallister (Matthew Broderick, in his usual performance only more unlikable) won't allow. In order to establish a more democratic election (and mostly to get that Fink girl out of the way for some reason), he requests former jock Paul Metzler (Chris Klien) to run for presidency, due to his charisma but with complete disregard for his lack of interest. In addition, Paul's tomboyish sister Tammy (Jessica Campbell) also runs purely out of spite, since her girlfriend runs off on her and hooks up with her brother instead. While all this is brewing, McCallister has problems of his own. Whilst happily married, he's also fooling around with his old friend's ex-wife. It's not a gratuitous subplot; it just adds to the crazy complicated world that Payne (along with screenwriter Jim Taylor) has created and it adds to the silliness and cleverness of it all.This is not your typical Hollywood teen movie and very much every cliché in the book is ignored here. Payne's high school is not simply surrounded with easily distinguished stereotypes. In fact, the good and bad guys aren't easily distinguishable here. There's a cunning, scheming side most of the characters here, and yet Payne and Taylor does a great job of actually making them likable (sort of). For example, we hate Mr. McCallister because he cheats on his wife and he would stoop so low to make sure Tracy will lose. And yet, part of us wants him to succeed, just because that Fink girl can easily get on our nerves for being obnoxious and rather b*tchy. Paul on the other hand is a rather nice guy; in fact too nice. He's a sardonic look at those candidates that may know very little about being a leader but somehow manages to get people's votes just because of how popular or nice they are. Meanwhile, his sister's campaign is a simple who cares?, a not-too far cry to what some members of society would choose to think. And this is what the whole movie's about It's about how messy and silly politics today can be and how messy the election of officials can be since mostly everyone plays dirty just to get what they want. It's not just America, but in other countries as well (including here in the Philippines).A neat little gem with some funny performances and a bitingly satirical premise, ELECTION has my vote. See it!

It's a satire with no heroes or villains, only a series of petty grievances that add up to one ridiculous and barely noteworthy story. The treatment is what makes this film stand out, considering the story itself is very predictable and simple. So there isn't much surprise or awe, but a grim sense of understanding and belief.Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick) is the popular social studies teacher in charge of overseeing the election for student body president, and Reese Witherspoon is an overzealous candidate who gets under Broderick's skin and inspires him to meddle. What's interesting is that McAllister's decisions have the broad stroke of an ethically defensible decision but morally the results are repugnant and embarrassing. He must stop her before it's too late -- really he's just upset that she'll probably climb much higher in life than he has. The sense of justice is what leads to his undoing. I also liked that the one deciding vote was cast for Tracy by her opponent, the hopelessly naive and good-hearted quarterback Paul (Chris Klein). There's something tragic in the way that he treats everyone around him so lovingly but he's treated with scorn because everyone resents his success as well (except again the dubious McAllister, who can't possibly resent someone with no brains).All in all I'd say this was one of the freshest comedies of the late 90s, more prescient and original than all the Austen/Shakespeare teen movies floating around at that time, more like Heathers in the late 80s or Lord Love a Duck in the 60s. In this film, the high school is a primal battle ground where the rules for adult society are borne out of blood and toil. The director even uses one of Morricone's creepiest and most intense death-knell soundtrack bites (from the forgettable Burt Reynolds Western Navajo Joe) to emphasize the instinctive violence at play in the power struggle. No setting is too small for the grand emotions, no human decision important enough not to be sullied by pettiness and sad yearning perhaps intermingled (as in McAllister's barely comprehensible loyalty to his dorky friend who slept with Tracy).

And I haven't seen it in almost as many years. Finally, re-watching what I considered a 5/5 star film back then and one of my all time favorites, it still holds up today. I remember admiring how great Witherspoon was in her pivotal role, and though loving Broderick in the classic 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off,' I gained deep respect for him as an actor from his role. Nothing changed. In fact, if anything, I love the movie more. Perfectly filmed, great cast &#x96; everyone did their part extraordinarily well, excellent comedic timing and lines, powerful story and filmed to make sure we felt every bit of their small Nebraska town. I truly felt as if I was living there. Mr. M (Broderick) believes he has the perfect life as a 3-time teacher-of-the-year, and so, as his ego grows, he feels one of his students, Tracy, deserves a downfall. He singlehandedly attempts to take her down in an uncontested student-body presidential race while inadvertently setting off a series of events that will affect his life as well as all those involved. All characters are flawed, all but a few &#x96; namely Paul, played pitch-perfect by Klein, channeling Keanu Reeves, except with realism, whereas Reeves is just plain dumb in his roles. Note, this is not a kid-friendly movie, it contains enough (statue) nudity (in the closing,) sexual innuendoes and simulated scenes, pedophilia and language to earn a hard-R. However, what I feel is so powerful in this original film, is the pure blend of teen-comedy, adult situations and realism. I've read a lot of criticism concerning the amount of adult humor and scenes whereas people were duped into believing this was a John Hughes update. No, this is strictly for adults&#x85;yearning for something fresh, original and sadly, funny about true life, in school or out. "},{"Title":"Vote for Election (I know, painful. Or should I say Payneful.)","Date":"14 June 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" Election is a film that grows on you. The first time I saw it, I liked it because of its mix of teen and adult themes, both narrow and wide. But this time I looked at it from a few different angles, and it became all the more intriguing.This time I focused on the three candidates for student body president Tracy Flick (in a deviously effective performance from Reese Witherspoon), Paul Metzler (played by an equally effective Chris Klein), and Paul's sister, Tammy (a forgettable Jessica Campbell).What I focused on, was what these characters represent. What I found -- which didn't take a rocket scientist, but required a look at the big picture -- were the party alignments for each candidate. In order to recognize this you need to step out of the high school universe that's built for us in Election, and focus on the American government, in general.Tracy is the republican representative. She's conservative, old-fashioned, and wholesome on the outside. On the inside she desperately craves victory, so much so that she's willing to sacrifice her integrity. The extent of republican corruption we'll never know, but it's there nonetheless. It's there in all political parties.Paul is the democrat. The People's Choice, so to speak. When Paul gets up to make his pre-election speech, the crowd goes wild because of his background as an athletic hero. The people like him because they can relate, they feel that he's in touch with the experiences and concerns of the masses. Tracy, on the other hand, is distant. She's in her own little bubble. And still, after Paul's nervous and ultimately empty speech, the crowd is stunned. Maybe the democrat isn't the best choice, after all.Then there's Tammy. Despite the weakest acting performance of the three candidates, Campbell's character is arguably the most important. Tammy represents the wild card, the Third Party philosophy. She sees the pointlessness and silliness of it all, and uses that to appeal to the crowd. Her tactic works, as she quickly becomes the most popular candidate of the trio. We find out, in fact, that she wins the election despite being eliminated from the ballot.That seems to be director Alexander Payne's message the two-party system is limiting, and put not-so-eloquently...dumb. Payne wants more from our government; more options, more reality, and less bullshit. But he knows he won't get it. That's why he's put his name to Election -- to ease his frustration.That frustration can be seen in Jim McAllister. "},{"Title":"Payne erases everything you know about high school comedies","Date":"11 June 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" Good storytelling and high school comedies seem to never go hand-in-hand, especially when MTV is involved, but Election breaks that barrier. Sure, it helps that it's more dark comedy and involves adult topics and situations, but Alexander Payne has crafted a film that surpasses high school clichés. He skillfully juggles four highly developed protagonists at once, three of them high school students, and manages to squeeze something more than a coming-of-age story out of them.Adapted from a novel by Tom Perrotta, Election centers around the titular event, in particular one for high school president. Overachiever Tracy Flick (Witherspoon) expects to run unopposed, but student government adviser Jim McAllister (Broderick) strongly dislikes her after her affair with another teacher, one Jim was friends with, got the teacher fired. Disgusted by the idea of her getting another something she wants without consequence, Jim inspires the injured quarterback of the football team, Paul Metzler (Chris Klein), to run against her. As if that weren't enough, Paul's younger sister Tammy, a sophomore, decides to run when her best friend ditches her and starts dating Paul.Payne's screenplay calls for a lot of narration among these four characters. We get inside their heads to learn of their conscious desire for why they're running or in Jim's case trying to ruin Tracy, but what we see on screen, of course, are some major subconscious motives. For example, everything going on in Jim's personal life -- his inability to get his wife pregnant and his eye for his recently divorced friend -- bleeds into his conduct at school. His narration says life was going good, when we see he's already making the choices that will lead to a foreshadowed end. Payne executes narrative here the way it's supposed to be done. It might seem overwhelming with four characters, but the transition is logical and often times clever.These are four great characters too, with the perfect actors in their parts. Each is given a clear portrait, characteristics that we like and dislike. Jim is an excellent, award-winning teacher with a sound moral compass, then again he denies issues in his personal life. Broderick's boyish looks but good dramatic skills have always helped him play double-sided characters. Tracy is ruthless and cares way too much, but we see her lonely side too, her fear when she crosses the line as portrayed well in her inner-monologue by Witherspoon. Klein plays an excellent Paul, dumb and naive, but well-intentioned and lovable. Then Tammy, with her rebellious exterior, seems to be the most honest.Unlike most high school comedies, the dark nature of the humor in Election keeps the events of the film mostly unpredictable, the surprising actions taken by the students and Jim throughout the story to get their way can be startling, unsettling or even emotional at times. This isn't your typical high school revenge story, the characters make choices based on their personal lives, their deep character issues, not strictly for laughs or because their jock or goody two-shoes stereotype calls for it. Payne establishes that this film is really about the democratic ideas of the election, the choices we make in our lives and the underlying moral or morally questionable desires that guide them in sometimes irrational ways. Whether in high school or older, we still make those choices all the time. To Payne, we can actually find meaning in high school drama in addition to humor.

The editing is solid.The characters are immensely amusing and very relatable. Who hasn't met an annoying girl like Tracy Flick who always raise their hands to answer a question. Who hasn't known a the good-hearted naive popular dude like Paul Metzler? Who hasn't come across a no nonsense careless soul like Tammy Metzler? Who hasn't had a teacher like Jim McAllister who seems to have no life outside school (at least from the student's point of view)? These are all people we have once known about in highschool.Matthew Broderick's Jim is a total loser but Broderick makes him lovable and you know that his deeds are MORALLY wrong but you want him to get away with it. Even after decades of being in the movie industry, the actor remains underrated. Reese Witherspoon stretches her versatility as the pathologically ambitious and manipulative Tracy Flick. It's another achievement in her boastful resume. This is one of the few good movies in Chris Klein's filmography and the actor plays the naive popular dude to the T. Jessica Campbell is a pleasant discovery who should be in more films.Though Payne is more recognized for 'About Schmidt' and the amazing 'Sideways', 'Election' easily ranks among his best.

That's why you buy films like 'Election'.But this took me severely by surprise. Because the plot wasn't predictable and the characters weren't 2 dimensional, this was a genuinely good film.It draws you in from the start with the introduction of the central characters; Tracy Flick and Mr. McAllister (or at least I think that's what his name was) Tracy is certainly intriguing as a completely obsessive workaholic and quite detestable in every way. Mr. McAllister is a lot easier to relate to, he's a normal person with normal faults and normal vices and you can't help but feel sorry for him stuck in the same building with Tracy and soon to be struck in one to one council meetings with her once she is elected as school president or some other odd title that slips my mind. You can see why then that he goes about persuading a far more popular sporty boy who has recently broken his leg to stand as an opposing candidate.You think you have them all sorted in your mind as the typical stereo-types but they aren't for example the opposing boy really is genuinely very nice and thoughtful if not very bright.Incredibly well directed and edited making good use of voice-overs freeze frames and the like it is in fact a surprisingly good film also filled with delightful surprises in both the characters and the over-all plot.Definitely worth watching.

Election though is a completely different matter, a dark, acidic comedy that never compromises. Not really a high school film except in the sense that it is set in one, the film works best as a satire on politics in general. Tracey Flick is the candidate who offers nothing other than her sense that she is entitled to win - the dual meaning of election as chosen may be significant here. Tammy gets the biggest cheer for a speech of mindless populism and Paul is a popular jock. Payne cynically seems to suggest that choice here is no choice at all - and he may very well be right. The heart of the film though is Matthew Broderick, never better, as a teacher whose deep hatred for Tracey may well mask attraction. Not a likable character his actions destroy him rather than Tracey, and the audience can both cheer and sympathize. Special kudos to Reese Witherspoon who makes the deeply unappealing Tracey both human and funny. None of this would matter though if the script was not as excellent as it is.

That's all still there when you see it again but it doesn't save this from being a smart and creative dark comedy but one that is only mildly entertaining and hardly the masterpiece many would claim it is upon first viewing.7/10 "},{"Title":"Who will you vote for?","Date":"5 May 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" One of the best written teen movies made,this film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay as well as a Golden Globe for Best Actress,Election is truly an underrated yet humble comedy and drama.Reese Witherspoon stars as Tracy Flick who is essentially an A-grade student who wants to win an upcoming election to determine who will become the next school president of Carver High's student body.However,popular teacher Jim McAllister(Matthew Broderick) has his own agenda;to derail and destroy Tracy's obsessive overachieving by having an opposition candidate by the name of Paul Metzler(Chris Klein) to run against Tracy.However,because on an incident relating to the incident which is found out by Larry Fouch(Nicolas D'Agosto) who is the committee chairman.This ruins the reputation on Mr McAllister.Good work by all of the cast.

Not too promising, is it? But it's a surprisingly engaging tale of morality -- not just among teen agers but adults as well. Nothing spectacular in the direction or the acting. Mathew Broderick is fine as the geometry teacher at Carver High School. Reese Witherspoon does nicely in the part of the tight-lipped, friendless, ambitious bitch, and the rest of the cast is at least up to professional standards.It's the writing that lifts this story out of the ordinary. The machinations of the high school students (whose characters vary from smart and selfish to too dumb to be anything other than generous) are paralleled by the sins of the adults, the chief one of which is Broderick having a fling with a colleague's wife. Not that there are a lot of cute zingers in the dialog, as there are in Pretty Persuasion. The comedy is distributed in dribbles throughout the development of the plot. And if the comedy is figure, the ground is always moral drama. A slight adjustment of the viewer's perception and what we're watching isn't really so funny.There are lines in the dialog that embody a piquant irony. The night before the SGA election, the three most prominent candidates get down on their knees and pray to God. The fustian Witherspoon's prayer runs along the lines of, You know I hardly ever ask You for anything, God, but in this case I must insist. The angry lesbian's prayer goes something like, I don't often pray to You, but that's only because I don't believe in You. Can you punish my enemies? The rich, stupid, gangling skiier says, I want to thank you for all my blessings. I have a new car for my 16th birthday and a new watch and, I've been told, a big penis. I won't go on, I guess. Things turn out more or less as they might in real life. People pay for their inadequacies and live with the consequences. Except I have some doubts that a teacher fired from an Omaha high school for moral terpitude would find a lucrative job as a guide at the American Museum of Natural History.That aside, it's not a bad movie, all sugary-looking on the surface but unleavened bread underneath.

In the meantime, we learn that Reese's character had an affair with a married teacher, resulting in his expulsion.Chris Klein is stripped of his title, and it goes back to Reese Witherspoon.

This relationship just seemed very strange because this man was married and he had to go to a high school student to get what he needed. He must have known that Tracy was a lonely student because then he knew that she would not say anything and it would be easier to keep it a secret. Also it seemed that Tracy had no respect for herself because she was seeing a teacher that she knew was married. But I guess this sort of thing happens often. I believe that a teacher and student relationship can be one that you can joke with them and act friendly with them but not one that you would sleep with them. Also the age difference is something that would bug me too because you are both on two different maturity levels, even if you are smart for your age.

So...my husband and I settled in to watch it and I could tell he had his doubts and thought it was going to be some teen comedy. I wasn't sure, myself. But we immediately engaged with it and both loved it. Very smart script..sometimes the narrative voice-over reminded me of Jack Handey's Deep Thoughts...silliness parading as thought provoking philosophy. Loved when Jim McAllister, having been set up as a stable family-oriented teacher, digs down into the family hope chest and pulls a video out of his collection of porn. And when Paul Metzler is shown having fallen asleep reading The Celestine Prophecy. And when Jim loses his wife, his home and his job, ends up in a $1550 per mo (plus utilities) apartment in New York training docents at the Museum of Natural History and characterizes his life as exciting and dream-fulfilling. It spoke volumes about what drives people to make decisions and how far they are willing to go to satisfy their own needs. A strong political statement disguised as a wacky teen movie? Much much more than that. It had the best of what I look for in a film... intelligent script, memorable characters, well-paced story, great performances, and a gift of something unexpected.

It's funny, witty and the script is what every screenwriter should aim for- dialogue that keeps you listening throughout the film without any chance for your brain to break off into other thought.Now the acting!! Matthew Broderick is excellent as the average teacher with a dark side. He is funny, believable and brings across the character perfectly. I couldn't imagine any other actor playing his role and being more perfect than he is. Reese Witherspoon, who soon became a personal favourite of mine after seeing this movie, is perfect to say the least. This is by far her greatest achievement in acting and she really deserved the Golden Globe that she was nominated for. The voice, the face, the actions all combine together to make her a perfect Tracy Flick. The other actors involved (including Chris Klein and Jessica Campbell) are brilliant as well and don't deserve to go unmentioned.After seeing this film I knew that Alexander Payne would go on to be a well respected and recognised director and screenwriter and it is great to see that he has. Even though he is probably best known for his excellent comedy 'Sideways' and has achieved the awards for that film, Election is a masterpiece that shouldn't go unrecognised.

Brodericks character, by example, highlights one of the percepts in philosophy one doesn't operate at the highest ethical level at all times in all situations. Broderick's character does what anyone could do act in a manner that will drastically after one's life. All actions have consequences, some more than others, but nonetheless actions speak louder than words.

Witherspoon, not exactly the Glen Close of her generation, gives the performance of a lifetime as the grasping, greedy student while the ever-reliable Matthew Broderick as the obsessive teacher appears to be Ferris Bueller all grown up here.

Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) is a manic overachiever who is running unopposed for the position of student body president at an Omaha high school. Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick) is the student government adviser and history teacher who decides that she needs some competition, so he talks popular, dumb jock Paul Metzler (Chris Klein) into running against her. When Paul's younger sister Tammy, a lesbian, sees her lover take up with Paul to hurt her, she decides to throw her hat in the ring as well. The election becomes a farce the more the players get involved, even tumbling into their personal lives, and causing some of them to make decisions they normally wouldn't make, putting careers and reputations on the line.Election is hilarious from beginning to end. Payne's screenplay (adapted from the Tom Perotta novel of the same name) is sarcastic, biting and dark, yet at times these characteristics are so subtle that my internal sarcasm meter didn't know where to go. Several times I thought, Oh come on&#133;. Then realized that it was all part of the joke, which is sheer brilliance, considering I live for dark films like this. All of the main players are fantastic, primarily Witherspoon and Broderick. I am hardly a fan of Witherspoon, or her films, but she played the part of Tracy Flick brilliantly. Unfortunately I will always picture Matthew Broderick as Ferris Bueller, but this worked in his favor this time, because I really enjoyed seeing him playing a teacher (and a twisted, vindictive one to boot) in this film.Payne's direction of Election is just so good. After seeing this film for the first time a few years ago, I wanted to check out About Schmidt, and because of my extreme liking of those two films, I was anxious to see Sideways this year, which I loved. He is not afraid to be unusual, particularly when his subjects are so&#133;ordinary. His use of hilarious music, (that hilarious tribal shrieking when Tracy gets her ire up never fails to make me laugh) and split screens, coupled with cinematography that is rife with primary colors are just a couple of the factors that have made Alexander Payne one of my favorite modern directors. I would recommend this film to just about anyone, as long as they can keep an open mind and remember not to take everything as seriously as things may be presented. Remember to turn on that sarcasm meter and watch Election &#150; it is sheer brilliance. 9/10 --Shelly "},{"Title":"delectable","Date":"11 June 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  this is one of those rare films I find that kept me hoping it wouldnt end, the laughs were so many and good.

And if the latter, how sweeping is it's intent? First, Election is definitely a black comedy, a pretty damn successful one at that. It's funny. Furthermore, it's original. And it's not puerile, but sophisticated.Election tells a story of, well, a high-school election. But it's politics taken to the extreme because the main players are exaggerations of what we can imagine to be real-life people with strange tendencies. Reese Witherspoon's Tracy Flick is a highly-obsessive over-achiever with neurotic attention to detail and terrifying determination towards good ambitions. She wants to win the election and is confident she will. Then we have Jim McAllister, performed so well by Matthew Broderick you'll be surprised, a popular teacher who a) does not like Tracy and b) is about to face a severe mid-life crisis because of meddling with her. Add to that a pair of siblings, Paul and Tammy Metzler, each of whom also run for election (Paul because Mr. McAllister wants Tracy to have an opponent, and Tammy to get back at Paul), the latter of which is not a lesbian, but loves people who just happen to all be girls.And they all clash, in strange, unknowing, darkly comic ways. The truly funny thing about it is the amount of accident and fate involved in the entire process. A theme runs through the story of the importance morals and ethics (a comic, underdeveloped theme of course, but a theme nonetheless) which, due to chance in large part, are shunned. The only person who, in fact, remains moral and ethical is Paul who is so nice and so incredibly dumb he could not hurt a fly because it would not occur to him.The real war, however, is between McAllister and Flick, not Flick and her opponents in the race. They are archenemies and they fight dirty. All this stems from McAllister's dislike of Flick and Flick's undying resolve. And, like I mentioned earlier, it's all really truly funny.But is the film more than just a sharp comedy? Election does in some sense satirize high-school elections and politics in general. It suggests the complete destruction of the democratic process which the election contestants and judges constantly invoke. At one point, in a scene bathed in irony, pertaining to the counting of ballots, it reveals the meaninglessness of the entire election. I'm inclined to believe, however, that Election is not a great satire of politics or the electoral process, and if it seeks to be one, it gets highly distracted. That's not a bad thing though since Election's swerving from the political theme is done to shed light on the strange, imaginative characters about whom, in the end, Election is actually about. And the film is fair to these curiously annoying people; it doesn't judge them. It presents them in their twisted weirdness, with their obsessions and their ambitions and their conflicts. While a hope of understanding between McAllisters and Flicks is childish and futile, watching them misunderstand each other is rarely this amusing.

Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) is merely a foil used to highlight the failings of anti-hero Mr. McAllister, who convinces himself he hates Tracy when he is secretly jealous of her ambition and success.  As in Payne's other films, the main characters in Election lie to themselves about their feelings, motives, desires, et al.  The viewer's recognition of these contradictions is integral to their understanding and enjoyment of the film.  It's not funny ha ha, it's funny cause it's true.  We are all jealous, dishonest, deceitful, sexually confused, inappropriate, misguided, bitchy, good-intentioned, etc. And so are these characters.  How anyone can construe this as broad is beyond me.

With staple actors from the teen pulp genre, like Reese Witherspoon and Chris Klein, it would be easy to write it off as merely another school holiday flick.  However, the issues dealt with include sexual relationships between teacher and student, and marital infidelity; subjects more suited to adult fare.The story is centred around an ambitious and perfect student (Witherspoon), and the teacher (a woefully miscast Matthew Broderick - stick to the slapstick, buddy) who decides to meddle with destiny and stop the rise and rise of Tracy Flick.  His solution?  To persuade another, more popular student to run against Tracy in the all-important election for student president.  What he doesn't foresee is how the election will change his own life forever.It is a comedy that works very well in some places.  Never again will one be able to consider a cupcake, without thinking of the 280 Pick Flick personalised cupcakes.  And the collection of sports jocks, nerds and sundry other students, whilst highly stereotypical, are good for a few laughs.  It is when the movie *tries* to be funny that it fails.  A bit of special-effects make-up slapped on to resemble a bee-stung eyelid isn't all that amusing, and seems out of character with the rest of the film.  Another notable aspect is the voiceovers done by the characters.  These are funny and very clever, in that the viewer gets a lot more by reading between the lines, than taking what is said at face value.Election is certainly worth a watch on an idle Saturday afternoon.

Reese Witherspoon rips posters down and has slept with one of her teachers.  I can't see how this is going to stop her from being a good student body president.When she finds out she has lost the election, I felt just awful for her. I say that Matthew Broderick is the bad guy here.  He reminds me a lot of a sleazy CIA operative doing a lot of illegal things behind the scenes that subvert democracy for his own selfish needs.

The film follows under early narratives of the three main characters to give the audience a preview of things to come. Mr McAllister (Broderick) is the most popular teacher at Carver High and has won Teacher of The Year several years in a row. One thing that really gets to him is the annoying overachiever Tracy Flick (Witherspoon) who is always first with the hand up to answer questions in his History class. This is also thrown in with the fact Tracy had a fling with a teacher called Mr Novotny, one of McAllister's best friends and thus had gotten Novotny fired.Tracy decides to run for student body president and McAllister doesn't want to see Tracy winning everything. He will do anything to stop her and that includes getting Paul Metzler (Klein) to run against Tracy and hampering with the ballots for the student president. Throw in a few other, rather uneeded sub-plots such as Metzler's lesbian adopted little sister Tammy who decides to run again Paul for dating the girl she believes to be her soulmate, and you've got the basic view of the film that director Payne aimed to achieve.I recently purchased the DVD after a year or so of first seeing the movie. I found this to be a very entertaining film with many funny scenes and all round fun - even though others disagree. Tracy is extremely irrtating and you love to hate her - this is Reese Witherspoon after all, one of the most charismatic, funny and charming actresses of this generation. I rate this her second best performance behind the 2001 hit Legally Blonde.4 stars out of 5.

Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick) is a twelve-year veteran of teaching Civis/History classes at George Washington Carver High School. He looks a little young, but maybe I can't get the Ferris Bueller image out of my mind. Anyway, he's also chairman of student council. He loves his job and has won three teaching awards. However, there's also Tracy Flick.Tracy (Reese Witherspoon) is an obnoxious overachiever whose hand is always straight up whenever a question is asked and gives dictionary definitions. McAllister can't stand her, since she's been student president for three years now, and she has no plans of not doing a fourth term. Even though she is running unopposed, she still puts up posters and buttons and cupcakes (!). So McAllister tries to sabotage her running in various ways, including sending in jock Paul Metzler (Chris Klein). Of course, things don't go as planned.Election has many funny parts, as well as many poignant parts, also. At times it could be bittersweet, and other times it could be a little mean-spirited (but still in a comedic tone). Most of the jokes aren't for today's teen comedies (although this movie did come out just four years ago), since they don't have to do with gross body functions. This is one teen comedy, however, that you'll want to own on DVD so you can watch it over and over.There is heavy narration (except for the middle-end), which I love, told by the four major characters McAllister, Tracy, Paul, and Paul's sister Tammy (Jessica Campbell), who may be a lesbian. She doesn't think so, stating, `It's not like I'm a lesbian or anything. It's just that all the people I've been attracted to happen to be girls. This makes for an interesting subplot that gets over her head. It seems like Payne (who also directed About Schmidt) likes to intertwine his stories McAllister's colleague Dave Novotny (Mark Harelik) has an affair with Tracy who gets fired; McAllister wants to have an affair with Novotny's wife Linda (Delaney Driscoll), and it goes on and on. It's actually quite funny to see how it all turns out.However, it can't all be good. Klein is way too old to play a high schooler (and he looks a lot like Keanu Reeves), and Broderick is too young to be a star teacher. The script, though always biting and sarcastic, doesn't really make us know why McAllister hates Tracy. They get us to like the characters (though all of the pratfalls McAllister befalls-it seems like Jeffrey Jones is getting back at him from Ferris Bueller), though.Payne must have some obsession with mouths; there are many close-ups and references to mouths. And the poster has a mouth. The music is simple yet elegant (but sometimes it sounds like the music comes from TV's Survivor). The pace is kept throughout, but gets bogged down towards the middle and lets its comedy take a breather. It does add dramatic effect, but it would have been easier to sit through if they kept the humor coming. I really had no idea what was going to happen at the end, and I was surprisingly satisfied at the conclusion, though I can understand where some people wouldn't.During the way of the movie, I was repeatedly reminded of Ghost World, because of its quirkiness, black humor, poignant drama, and Thora Birch decided not to take the role of Tracy (she'd also be perfect). It seems like the mocking of high school was dead on.I though Broderick was perfect (despite his age), and Witherspoon did an excellent job. Klein was also great, and supporting characters (like Colleen Camp) were good, no matter how small the role. So, I would very highly recommend Election, no questions asked.My rating 8/10Rated R for strong sexuality, sex-related dialogue and language, and a scene of drug use.

She is unopposed until another teacher (played by Matthew Broderick) recommends that Paul Metzler, the football team's quarterback who has had to quit sports for a while due to an injury, run against her. Tracy doesn't take Paul seriously, feeling he is unqualified (and he probably is; he doesn't seem too bright) though he is popular.  Paul's sister, who is in a lesbian relationship, ends up running against her brother when the other girl leaves her for Paul and she gets jealous.  The sister is the one to worry about; she gets the most applause of the three when the candidates address the students because she promises absolutely nothing and doesn't care.  Meanwhile, Broderick's character gets a little too close to the wife of the other teacher after she kicks out her husband.  The second half of the movie means consequences for some of the misdeeds of the first half, and new ones you'll simply have to watch to see.

"}{"Title":"A big let down; very average film.","Date":"12 November 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  I was not at all taken with this film. I had high expectations, from all notices and such like; praise, adorned with phrases like incisive satire, stood out. A shame the film so singularly fails to match the plaudits.Anyone with a real interest in political satire or indeed, just in politics, would be strongly advised to look elsewhere. The Manchurian Candidate, Primary Colours, The Candidate, Bob Roberts and numerous others have far more to say. A main problem with this film is its anonymous, far from distinctive direction. There is no linking, imaginative vision holding together and underpinning the film. There is a painful contrast for this film, with virtually any made by the Coen Brothers, Wes Anderson, David Lynch, Terry Zwigoff, or indeed Donnie Darko's new director, Richard Kelly. There is not even the feeling that this is work compromised by committees and Hollywood marketing; the basic idea and execution are just nothing special. That this kind of film is so masqueraded as an incisive political satire is quite laughable; its message is far from new, and it consciously avoids any real political conflict. No issues are really raised, bar those of personality, for the main candidates.Matthew Broderick frankly irritates; this is no performance of stature; it's an example of unkempt, unsubtle acting lacking in nuance. It's just a turn and not one that really entertains. The thing is; the part could have been well played and carried a bit of impact, but it is squandered here. One really is not made to care about stopping Witherspoon's character, as the alternatives and the diffident Broderick hold no greater appeal.There ought not to be much said about the ill-judged forays into physical comedy; very mediocre stuff. It's all a shame really, as Reece Witherspoon is really quite impressive, albeit in a sure-fire role, that of high-flying, strutting, style-over-substance Miss Tracy Flick. It's not a teenage part of the depth or nuance of Donnie Darko or of Max Fischer, and it's really a shame more sides aren't brought out in her. But, and it is a considerable but, Witherspoon plays the fairly limited role to a tee; all saturnine flicks of the hair, ice maiden moral penury and gamine grimacing. One could say that Ms. Witherspoon overacts, but at least she is entertaining with it.It seems very much that she's gone on to a curious assortment of roles; ill-fitted playing Wilde; almost self-parody in Legally Blonde, as a bumptious, bitchy, indeed blonde; taking a supporting role alongside Sandler... It doesn't seem a considered career path on her part.There are stray good lines and ideas, but nothing really adds up; the plotting is inadequate and very predictable fare. This film is the sort where one is expecting so much more involvement, incident and intrigue than is delivered. The ending all too readily sums this up &#150; an easy, `moral' conclusion, showing Reece's character in a very simplistic light. It all comes across as glib rather than poignant, as seems to have been intended, not helped by the `knowing', pseudo-confiding smugness of the voice-over. So many post-modern films just resort to the voice-over tactic without any real reason; it's just a cover here, for lack of drama. The whole ending is a complete damp squib that thinks it's something profound, where it's really just one-dimensional and dramatically flat. Part of the problem is that no real case is made in favour of other characters than Tracy Flick; they're all irritating, limited or stereotypical. Indeed, many are easily forgettable; many are just plain annoying, and mere plot devices such as the rival candidate, dredged up to take on our Tracy.  But, we cannot really feel that much sympathy for her, due to the stridency of Witherspoon's playing; focused, but perhaps one-note acting that portrays the character as a preened, vacuous careerist without any tangible other sides. Dear Ms. Flick's just not human enough, or eccentric enough, shall we say. Basically, Election is a simplified faff that ought to have raised its game considerably. This film had a lot of potential, but we end up with a far from engaging, routine picture, possessed of a heart as hollow as those of its characters. It is content merely to preside over Broderick's dullard pratfalling and peruse over Witherspoon's impish person.Rating- ***/*****  "},{"Title":"A Look in the Teenage Life","Date":"22 September 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  The movie Election was one of the funniest and most clever movies I have seen. With a great cast and wonderful acting, this movie about a high school election gone wrong has combined humor, intelligence, and real life situations that the viewer can relate to relay its main messages to the viewer. Election seems to capture certain realities of teen life in the early to mid 1990s fairly well. For example, not everything is perfect in any teenager's life, and each teen has his or her own issues and problems that they are dealing with; Tammy is fighting for acceptance in school, and in finding a companion. In addition, the affairs that take place throughout the movie are becoming increasingly common these days, even between students and teachers. Finally, everyone has wanted something so badly they could almost taste it, and although the viewer may not want to understand Tracy and her motives, one can put themselves in her shoes and feel sympathy for her. The main message that Election seem to convey to its audience is that you cannot always get what you want and therefore, you should not try to interfere with what is going to ultimately result. Take for example, Mr. McAllister's affair with Diane, as well as his interference with the election results. As Tracy stated in the beginning of the movie, interfering will only make things worse. Overall, Election was a worthwhile movie that provides comic relief and aunique technique of allowing the viewer to see inside the character's psyche by giving each of them a voiceover; this is why I give Election 8 stars out of 10.

I think that her role as Tracey in this film brings out alot of her own personality.She is running for president of her class, and certain that she will acheive it. As the highest achieving student in senior high - she's been in every club and the president of everything possible. She manages to incense one of her teachers, played by Matthew Broderick. He's lost his best friend due to her intellectual attachment that turned sexual to his former best friend and teacher at the school, and is irritated at her rabid go-getter attitude and the sense that she feels better and more deserving than anyone else. He wants to bring her down, and enlists a very popular student who was the school's best athlete to do so.I really am not a fan of Broderick, but he does alright here as a caring teacher who wants fair play. The innocent boy he enlists win, but only by a vote, because Broderick has thrown a couple of ballots away which would have made Tracey the winner.This movie is FUNNY, due to Witherspoon's intense competetive Tracey, who CANNOT accept defeat, and the things that ensue after she is found to be the winner after all.There are other stories going on, a lesbian affair by the popular boy's sister that turns out miserably, with her moping and strange thoughts, Brodericks unfaithfulness to his wife, and believe it or not there is the driest humor and wit in these stories as well as in the main one.I thought this the only good teenage film worth watching at all besides Clueless in the past decade.As the so very aggresive and positive Tracey, Witherspoon shined.

Her pursed lips, big eyes and bouncing blond hair are enough to make one vomit (in a good way!) She's terrific in every sense of the word, and she deserved every award she received in this, the most complex and daring role of her career thus far. A pity that she hasn't had such a fun and simultaneously dark role since (somehow, although I loved Carrie-Anne Moss, I think Reese would have been great as the manipulating Natalie in Memento... do you agree?)Onto the movie itself -- Alexander Payne does a fabulous job of pulling us in to his intricate camera work and witty cinematography (who can stifle laughter at Witherspoon's freeze-frames?), telling the satirical story of a high school election gone amuck. Matthew Broderick is pathetic and funny as Jim McAllister, and Chris Klein is hilarious as the absent Paul Metzler (you betzler!) All these characters are either corrupt, insane, or just dumb, confusing the viewer and making us wonder -- who should actually be caring about in this movie? The teacher? The obnoxious over-achiever? The football jock softy? The confused little sister? Or maybe it's the disgusting former teacher whose life was also ruined by Tracy... the confusion here brings out the satire all the more.One of the parts about this movie I find most humorous is the fact that Jim McAllister's life really is ruined by the election, and Tracey's reaction as she learns her defeat would suggest that her life is ruined too. But in the end, the antagonist prevails, leaving you upset and gritting your teeth -- and that's exactly how Payne wants it.

When this unentertaining, God-awful piece of dreck finally came to the end credits, I had never felt more disappointed or P.O'd at a movie. It was a boring, cynical, and exaggerated movie that seemed to scream Look at us, we're proving something!! in every scene. Now let's get down to the REAL griping. Election tells the story of Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon, talented as always, but not likable here). Despite her cherubic face, innocent curls and perky demeanor, Tracy is a budding tyrant underneath it all, with a bloodthirsty ambition to lead everything in high school (her list of extracurricular activities is ridiculously long), including being class president. Matthew McBroderick plays Tracy's teacher, Jim McAllister, who's fed up with this compulsive hand-raiser, and decides to have someone run against her in the election to take her down a notch. McAllister seems like the kind of guy Ferris Bueller would grow up to be, but he isn't. McAllister is the most hapless, hypocritical, morally bankrupt loser this side of Seinfeld's George Costanza. He finally finds a competitor for Tracy in Paul Metzler (Chris Klein, who's actually pretty good). Paul isn't the brightest color of the rainbow, but he agrees to do it. Another person who competes is Paul's lesbian kid sister, Tammy. Tammy is supposed to be the voice of wisdom, but she's really nothing more than a self-obsessed, whiny delinquent.Election's biggest problem is that it's a satire that tries too hard to be a satire. It tries to prove too much, but fails miserably. It's short-sighted and vague much too often. For instance, the only character who's blessed with honesty, integrity, and self-discipline is Paul, and yet he's the dumbest character in the movie. Doesn't that imply that moral people are half-witted numbskulls? I thought it was a huge misstep that Tracy won the election. It not only defeats the purpose of the movie, but it also makes no sense because it's very obvious that Tracy isn't popular enough to have won in the first place. Too many things are also unexplained why does McAllister constantly cheat on his wife? She doesn't seem bad, and they never delve into a clearer reason. I liked McAllister's punishment, but the wrong people got comeuppance. I won't go further than that, but please do yourself a favor and skip this wasted opportunity of a movie.

I didn't read them all, but I did notice one trend that I thought was interesting almost every review from a foreign poster was negative.  This engenders the following question Is this movie too American to be appreciated?  I think it may be.  Without the American High School experience, you may not be able to relate.This is a brilliant, subtle, comedy that is paced with details and satire, and for my money is only slightly behind Raising Arizona as greatest comedy ever.  The character development is OUTSTANDING!  This is achieved through clever narrations and adroit irony (a shot of the teacher leading Tracy to his bedroom is covered by a voice over in which she says What I really miss is our talks and Mr McCallister claims that he really likes Tracy over a shot of her hard-earned signature list in a dumpster).  The side issues are delectable and come out of nowhere- the lesbian revenge, the bee sting (not to mention that clever twist that Broderick, as a teacher, has his most memorable role as slacker Ferris Bueller).The film is unbelivable percptive.  There is a grain of truth in many or the implications Teachers do dislike some students, some teachers do choose that occupation because they really didn't want to leave HS, and some teachers are manques of some sort who underachieved and may be jealous of overachieving students (who go to much better colleges) and that we all often loathe successful people.  In other words it shows humans as real and flawed.Broderick is, of course, great, but Witherspoon (who she did the fill me up scene with a strait face I'll never know) and Klien, as the credulous jock are equally up to par.Ultimately however the stength is the ludicrousness that we all know a high school election to really be.  Tammy's speech sums it up and is fantastic.Highly recommended.

Midlife crisis, spliting up with his wife, trouble with a teen...sounds a lot like American Beauty to me.

I thoroughly enjoyed it &#150; so much so that I sat and re-watched it several times (and liked it more with each viewing). Now I'm beginning to wonder just what my problem is (!). 'Cause I have to admit, this movie shouldn't be a likable movie at all as others herein have rightly noted, it does have a rather dark thread running through it, and it touches (but doesn't dwell) on a lot of off-color issues such as adultery, teen sex, sex between a teacher and student, plus lying, cheating, extreme self-obsession, and, oh yes... vote tampering. So how could this possibly be an enjoyable story?Well, I enjoyed the heck out of this movie, and I think it has a lot to do with the relative credibility or believability of the main characters. (By the way, the teenagers in this film *really* seem like highschool-aged teenagers, not twenty-somethings pretending to be..). In spite of the personal shortcomings in virtually all of the characters (with the possible exception of the high school principal, Dr. Walt Hendricks (played by Phil Reeves), who was a genuinely decent guy), you can't help but see a little of yourself in each of them. Flawed, yes, but they're all just oh-so-human, and oh-so-believable. Sad but true, we really do live in a world such as the one portrayed in Election, and the movie merely has some mirthful fun as it skewers that reality.On technical merits, I think this movie is quite well put together. I really like the way the story moves at a lilting pace, steadily gathering substance and volume, with nice little twists and turns thrown in with careful timing.  You'll appreciate the way the plot inexorably develops, grabbing your interest more and more, with additional little layer after carefully measured layer of increasing plot complication thrown into the mix. You actually care about the final denouement of the story, because as the story unfolds, you really do start to care about the players as human beings, and you can't help but become interested in their individual destinies. And when the final denouement does arrive, well, I just like the way the movie wraps up it's neither a happy ending nor a sad ending. It's kind of both, and somehow the way the story ends seems enormously satisfying, and very fitting. This movie works for me on a number of levels. There's so much to comment on, I could go on and on... I'm sure if you want to spend time on it you can pick out wonderful subtleties, metaphors, symbolism, allegory, etc. And if you've seen Ferris Bueller's Day Off (which also starred Matthew Broderick), you can't help but pick up one or two subtle parallels and reminders of that film. In short, go see it &#150; just keep an open mind about the dark thread - and enjoy the ride.  Oh yeah, forgot to add Jessica Campbell (the young actress who plays Tammy Metzler) is so cute that I have decided to see every movie she ever appears in. Forever. No, really, I'm not kidding here. She's just that adorable!! And I really liked that cynical speech she gives in the film in front of the entire student body. I laughed so hard I was literally pounding my knees. (That's one of the reasons I watched the film several more times &#150; just to watch her give that speech.) Out of the three candidates, I would have voted for her hands down! But since I can't do that, I'll just go watch every movie she ever plays in. How's that for devotion?

Sure, I chuckled a few times, but I expected so much more from a presumably hilarious sleeper comedy.  Many scenes seemed gratuitously lax, something in which keener wit could have fixed.  Overall, the script was not taut and seemed rather expulsive & lazy.  Even Dead Man on Campus (another MTV production) was funnier than this one (You have to admit, the latter had it's moments). Caricatures (the overachiever, however, was portrayed pretty good) permeate this movie.  Nothing memorable here.  Now, I'd like to have seen Tammy Metzler's life unfold.

Election is a winner !","Date":"23 September 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  minor spoilers... I have not seen a more hysterically funny satire than Election. The wry observations and sardonic look at people left me bent over in agony from so much laughing. It may be futile to summarize the sublime beauty of Election so permit me to just make some of my own observations on why it works so well Tracey Flick's persona is nailed by the filmmakers. The goody-two-shoes in high school always took everything way too seriously, and they recognize that. While everyone else realizes its just a student body election, she approaches it like it is a senate race. Case and point, the speech student body presidents never make any real changes, does she really think there are lunch issues to be ironed out in some all-night meeting ? In her mind probably yes. Its only a matter of time before she starts calling in her legal team and so when Mr. M tries to lecture her on the prudent course of action, she turns the tables and puts him in his place, refusing to go on without her lawyers present, for a student election no less! Notice how the sex issue worms its way into Mr. M's life, Flick inserts a few odd statements like harmonious and productive into a seemingly casual conversation, and Mr. M does exactly what all trapped men would do in the situation he goes straight for the porno stash in the basement. Hilarious. Also, notice how there is no mention of his salicious desires for Flick, yet while making love to his wife, her face suddenly appears on screen egging him onward and invigorating him. Wonderful ! Matthew Broderick's portrayal of Mr. M's downward spiral into the vortex of corruption is terrific, complete with a earnest hopefulness and ho-hum attitude, you never think he could possibly crack as he winds his way further and further into betrayal, reminiscent of William H. Macy's character in Fargo we see the cracks, but the dam never really breaks. In fact he turns out ok, with his life seemingly in order, despite having to leave his past in shame. In fact, I found all the characters in Election to be refreshingly upbeat and hopeful, an ironic twist that their daily lives are filled with a calm vengence. I think the filmmakers had that in mind, if you notice the movie is shot in winter, every shot looks clean and tidy like just after a rain; the streets, the school grounds, the houses, et. al.  but of course its just clean and happy on the surface, while underneath, in the sewers, its a dirty rotten mess of humanity, but who needs to go there when you've got the American Family Inn on the interstate where adultery is as easy to obtain as the cheesy razor and toothpaste kit in the vending machine (a definite sign you've hit rock bottom). Each character even has their own pleasant resolution again reiterating the point about hopeful and earnest futures (a common theme in elections).  You don't see too many movies with such a funny look at daily life yet Election is able to combine the mundane, the scandalous and the banal into an trenchant fable, again much like Fargo. I wouldn't go so far as to call it scathing because there is just too much pleasure and happiness in all this and there should be! If you can find such humor in the daily grind, you may have stumbled on a secret of living a happy life !

Elections are coming up and at first, Tracy is the only one running, until another student at her high-school, Paul Metzler, (Chris Klein.) ends up running too and then his sister, Tammy,  (Jessica Campbell.) decides to run up against him for revenge. So, who's going to win? This is the type of the movie, which leaves you thinking, 'Who cares.' I sure didn't, which was a shame as I thought I'd like Election. Also, Matthew Broderick who plays, Jim McAllister a teacher who doesn't really get along with Tracy, tries to find a way not to get Tracy elected. Yawn!Now, the brilliant Thora Birch was actually supposed to play the role of Tracy Flick and she sure would of done a much better job, considering, she's a *really* great actress.

This film is more than a great, biting story with lots of insight into people, politics and rejection -- it's a dead-on depiction of the current generational shift from Gen-X to the GenY/Millennial group (those born after 1982).Reese Witherspoon is great at displaying the 'dark side' of Millies -- confidence and faith in authority mutated into absolute assurance that she will get what she wants. Why? Her mom told her so. People have been predicting that the new generation will be more 'civic minded' than Xers, and the film examines the consequences.Matthew Broderick is also great as the alienated, cynical Xer teacher. What makes him hate Witherspoon so much? I think he sees himself as having been ignored at her age.  Now he sees a new generation coming in to finish him off. The final scene confirms this. The young Millie zooms off with the old (Boomer) Congressman, leaving Xer Broderick in the dust. Compare to Dr. Evil's rejection of his Xer son for 'Mini-Me'. A parable of the ongoing shift in our culture.

Even the central character that Broderick plays is being hugely mocked - you may at first think it is sympathetic to his plight in a sense - but you only need to fleetingly consider what is actually going on to realise that he is just being laughed as each aspect of his life crumbles to the ground. Reese Witherspoon plays the obnoxiously swotty teen to perfection and probably delivers her best performance yet. Chris Klein is also worthy of a mention for his almost too natural portrayal of a popular football player. The scene where he drafts campaign slogan ideas whilst driving home is genius, as well the breakdown by Dave Novotny when he's found out for sleeping with Tracey - we're in love. Jessica Campbell is also delightful in her small role as the rebellious Tammy Metzler. Combining a very fast pace with an equally quick witted script, Election delivers high school satire far cleverer and much superior to the likes of American Pie and the awful 10 Things I Hate About You. 9/10 "},{"Title":"High School bashing -- FINALLY!","Date":"3 August 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  I hated high school.  In my opinion, it is a shameful aspect of the American culture.  Overconfident students, complacent teachers.  The popular kids, the scapegoats.  High school cultivates many of human flaws in young people, the worst of which is hypocrisy.  What's needed to get ahead in high school  a big mouth.  That's all.  And then there are all those activities.  What is the purpose of all those extracurricular activities, except to beef up one's college application?  Why not invest the extra time and energy into learning?  No -- instead, students engage in meaningless after-school activities, whose beneficial value is absolutely zero.  I think individual reactions to this wonderful movie depend on personal experiences of viewers; as a top student in academics in my high school, I was often pressured by school administrators not to devote quite so much time to studying and to do something for the school.  It is a strange suggestion, coming from a supposed place of learning.  Not surprisingly, I really enjoyed the movie.  It shows just why American high schools produce students who think themselves the smartest, while they are in fact, the most ignorant.

It didn't rip off the classic 1950 Bette Davis movie, it just has the same since of character. Tracy Flick is a high school student who's only concern, no matter what is to be number one. She has so much of her future laid out ahead and she knows it. Jim McAllister is one of Tracy's teachers, he's at the opposite side of the life pole. He's made choices and is now where he is. Jim McAllister hates Tracy, and he doesn't even know it. But the comedy starts when we see Jim trying to tack control of his life, when in reality he has none.There are a dozen sub-plots that all work well within the movie, because they all relate to either Tracy or Jim.If your in the mood to laugh at all the mistakes you ever made, watch Election, or if your in the mood (and young) to see how one gets ahead, once again watch Election. ***1/2 (9) "},{"Title":"A good film (if you overlook the novel) SPOILER ALERT!","Date":"16 July 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  This was a great movie. On my list, it was one of the top films of 1999. Reese Witherspoon was great. I don't know why she was overlooked at the Oscars. Except for some editing glitches, the film is almost flawless. However, there is one major problem with this movie. It is grossly distorted from the novel. In the novel, Paul & Tammy's last name is Warren and the school is Winwood. The ending in the novel is completely different from the movie. In the novel SPOILER ALERT, Dianne forgives Jim and the two stay married and live together. Jim then gets a job at a used car dealership (how convenient.) Meanwhile, Tracy and Paul (who had never broken his leg in the first place) are somewhat friends. On the last day of school, Paul & Tracy sign each other's year books. Tracy later goes to the car dealer to see Jim. Tracy test drives a car with Jim and drives to the school to get her year book for Jim to sign, and all ends happily like in Gilbert & Sullivan's The Mikado. There are some other distortions as well. Tammy wanted to go to Immaculate Hart because (while she was suspended) she saw this girl who went to that school and got an instant crush on her, although she falls for someone else once she starts going there. The rules for counting ballots called for three independent counts. Tracy tears down Paul's posters because she wants to put hers in the same spots, and Tammy frames herself although she has no proof. Despite these distortions, the movie is still very good. Don't get me wrong. I love this movie.

Watch it again. It works on many, many levels, and it gets funnier every time you watch it.A few clues to some of the idiots who have slammed this movie.  Matthew Broderick's character isn't SUPPOSED to be sympathetic.  It's called an everyman.  He's not plastic and heroic, he's HUMAN.  We identify with him because he reminds us of ourselves  we all have noble intentions, we all try hard, but we also screw up and we're hypocrites sometimes and sometimes our so-called noble intentions lead us to do rotten things, things we never dreamed we would stoop to.This movie doesn't let any of its characters off the hook.  No one is blameless, and no one is unredeemable.  It's human comedy.  If you like cookie-cutter characters and simplistic plotlines, go elsewhere.  The fact that Scary Movie made twenty times as much money as this movie did makes me cry for America's Youth.  America's Youth also made Alanis Morrisette's song Isn't It Ironic? a hit when there wasn't one ironic thing in the song.THIS MOVIE, on the other hand, is full of irony.  Sweet, hilarious irony. I mean, you're talking about a high school ethics teacher who engages in blatantly UN-ethical behavior.  Why?  The levels go very deep  1) He believes in democracy  2)  Reese's character slept with his best friend and got him fired  3)  He's secretly attracted to Reese and he's scared that she'll seduce him too  4)  He can't get his wife pregnant and he hates himself for it  5)  He's stuck in a thankless, dead-end teaching job and all he has to comfort him are his lofty principles (return to #1 and repeat endlessly).A lot of people have slammed Matthew Broderick's acting on this comments page.  I have no idea what you're talking about.  Rent a few of his best movies  Brighton Beach Memoirs, Wargames, Name of the Rose.  This guy is a broadway-trained actor who chooses offbeat, solid roles and he takes the risk of not looking like a hero all the time.  When he did play a hero, Ferris Bueller, he created an icon.

Unlike movies such as Network and Hospital (that are brilliant examples of satire), Election is not outraged by what it is parodying. It revels in its portrayals of greed, avarice, licentiousness, betrayal, et al.

The reason why I probably enjoyed the movie so much was because I can relate to it.The movie is set in highschool and not in republican and democratic headquarters,which the average guy like me can't relate to.I believe that everyone can relate to the character of Tracey Flick which is so beautifully played by Reese Witherspoon,who was also in Pleasantville and Cruel Intentions.Either you can relate to her because someone like her was in your highschool or maybe you were like Tracey.Every school has its Tracey Flick,the straight A student who seems to be part of every school club,who is quick to raise their hand at every question asked,the type of student who becomes very very friendly when they're running for school president.This is the whole basic story of the movie.Tracey Flick is the type of girl who has that only born to win mentallity.She'll do anything to win her school election. Mr.Mcallister which is played by Matthew Broderick is one of her professors.He dispises her but in a weird way still cares about her.He doesn't like her,know it all mentality and he'll stop at anything in order to make her lose the election.He even convinces a dim-witted jock to run against her for school president because he knows that he might win based on popularity.What also works for the movie is that it only doesn't focus on the election but it also focuses on the individual lives of each character and that is what makes this movie so great.I don't want to explain much more because I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone who hasn't seen it.Once you see it you'll understand why it got the R rating.All in all this movie gets a 9 out of 10.Guaranteed laughs from beginning to end.

This is an exceptional comedy, which reflects in itself the atmosphere of war of thousand of other kinds of elections.

This film has the setting of a high school presidential election.  Tracy Flick is an over-achiever and the leading candidate; she is the only candidate in the school's election.  Reese Witherspoon plays her to perfection.  She is perky, spirited, smart, and in the eyes of one teacher (Matthew Broderick) demonic. Tracy has already inadvertently gotten one teacher fired by having an affair with him.  Mr. McAllister (Broderick) tries to steer clear of Ms. Flick, but being her teacher and head advisor of the student counsel, he finds that task rather difficult.  To try and keep himself from any possible danger he seeks the help of the high school's ex-football star Paul Metzler. Knowing full well that Metzler will never play football again he encourages him to run against Tracy in the election.  Chris Klein plays Metzler with such a goofy charm working for him that I would find it hard to believe that anyone couldn't like him. The third party is Tammy Metzler who is only running to get back at her brother and his girlfriend, Lisa.  You see, Paul doesn't realize it, but before he was dating Lisa she was dating Tammy.  Angered, and love-scorned, Tammy runs the type of campaign I remember from Brewster's Millions, and tells the voters not to vote at all.  She is very funny and very malicious, with what one might call a soft spot. Election also explores McAllister's home life, which is a little boring, and so is his sex life.  His wife wants a baby and is using sex solely for that purpose.  However unromantic the sex scenes are, they are quite hysterical. He fantasizes about affairs with a friend of the family and Tracy Flick. Matthew Broderick is in a small way horrifying to watch in this role. Remember that he was once Ferris Bueller.  He is often disgusting, and pitiful, but always there to laugh at, and very loudly at times.  The best scene of the movie is Broderick staring in desperation into the large face of a vending machine. This film works on many levels, not one of which would be as a teenage comedy.  This is not She's All That, nor is it Never Been Kissed.  It is darker, and it knows it.  As far as political-satires go, Election is the best I've seen, and to think, it's school-political-satire.  The levels of the performances are outstanding.  Matthew Broderick has recently had a very bad spell (Godzilla, and Inspector Gadget).  Here he hits the right note playing the teacher mildly and seriously.  Reese Witherspoon smothers the screen with her huge smile and striking personality, even if it persuades you to hate her.  Chris Klein who also stars in this year's American Pie (almost the same role), reminds me of a young Keanu Reeves in films like River's Edge and Parenthood. Like most of the films I mentioned in the above statement Election is not for everyone.  Some people will be disgusted, some will be offended, and some will turn it off.  I believe in the realism of this movie.  I believe in a world unbound by censorship and an industry able to make this art, imitating life, imitating art.  Perhaps one day we will all understand the significance of these movies.  I should have run for class office.

For many filmmakers this has become a tired formula  See people.  See them fit into tidy little stereotypes.  See their quirky character traits exaggerated and mocked.  See the bad ones get what they deserve.  Roll credits.Alexander Payne's Election is much too smart for that.  It builds a broad social commentary around a farcical and nasty school election, while deftly dodging all the traps that similar movies fall into.  Although the characters' quirks are exaggerated for laughs (most memorably Reece Witherspoon as the conniving overachiever Tracy Flick), they are still well-developed 3-dimensional human beings.  Payne forces us to understand these people and sympathize with them, even as we watch them do very, very bad things.  The four interwoven narratives show the events of the movie from each main character's perspective-- a fresh idea that gives Election a unique quality.Movie cliches are smashed left and right, and we are never quite able to guess what's going to happen next.  The acting is generally outstanding, particularly from Witherspoon and Broderick.  The humor ranges from extremely subtle to outright slapstick, from cute and sweet to merciless and black.  Everyone gets what they deserve... or do they?  The ending is at once hilarious, unexpected, and somewhat fitting.  Election is the sort of comedy that hits uncomfortably close to home and makes us laugh (and squirm a little) at that which is all-to-familiar.  In other words, it's a satire in the truest meaning of the word.  And that's a real treat.

The film portrays itself as a comedy. However it also seems to be tackling some deeper issues such as lesbianism and coping when everything you love has been stripped away from you. I therefore couldn't find anything particularly amusing about it. All this would be fine though if the film tackled these issues well. Unfortunetly it doesn't. These things are just glossed over, nothing is gone into in any great depth and at no point do you feel that the film makers have taken an issue as far as they could have done. Also we are left in some doubt as to how we are supposed to feel about the various characters. I assumed that I was suppose to like and empathise with at least one of them. It was a real shame that I couldn't do that because they are all characters who you grow to hate or find annoying as the film progresses. Ultimately Election is a film which tries it's hardest to be funny while at the same time dealing with some issues and giving a message.

I rented this movie expecting the standard American High School / Teen movie, but my original perceptions of the film were crushed early on, and I found a very moving and dark film. Broderick was superb, you couldn't help but feel sorry for him when he was in a state despite the two major downfalls in his judgement that led to his &#150; somewhat temporary- demise. I expected a Wetherspoon movie, but we were shown deeper into Broderick's character and this was the high point of a very good film. I don't usually get into analytical ramblings about films, I usually sit on the fence and enjoy a film for what it should be, a source of entertainment. But for some reason this film drew me in deeper and deeper. The humour was very subtle and dark in places but it was the sort of humour that different people draw from in different ways. The whole election plot really took second fiddle to Broderick's characters life, and although good performances were put in by Chris Klein and his on-screen Sister, as well as Reese Wetherspoon, Broderick really took this film for himself and his character was so deep and interesting. I'm amazing myself about writing in this way about a film, especially this one, and although this film will never win any awards and may be ridiculed by many. Many of the reviews I've read have centred around Reese but Broderick's performance stole the show for me, the inclusion of nice little techniques such as the freeze frames and frequent voice-overs added greatly to the film. Overall I was expecting very little but I came away with so much from it.

Witherspoon is exceptional as always as the ambitious, and possibly evil, Tracy Flick who will do anything and destroy anyone in her ruthless pursuit of power. Her uptight mannerisms and facial expressions are worth the rental fee alone as she works night and day to achieve her goals. Set against her is three-time teacher of the year winner Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick) who, seeing her rise to said position of power because of the mostly apathetic student body, sets out on a noble yet ultimately self-destructive course to stop her at all costs. Though the school itself is full of people it often appears like there are only two combatants locked in a struggle for supremacy, each with their own agenda and methods. Witherspoons character comes across as equalling determined and manipulative as she is pathetic and needy. Broderick on the other hand sees his life spiral out of control as his all-pervading crusade to stop her eats away at his otherwise feeble and easy-going nature. The supporting cast also perform superbly with Chris Klein (Who looks and sounds more like Keanu Reeves every day) earning particular praise for his nice, deadpan yet intelligent jock who, under Brodericks guidance, plans his own campaign. This is where the film elevates itself above normal teen movies with the very morals and ethics so subtly woven into the film early on becoming the most important part of this titanic struggle. As Broderick falls deeper into the dark side in his effort to stop Witherspoon he loses the decency and even-handedness he so valiantly displayed at the beginning. Is he really right to use Flick's own dubious ethics against her, even at the risk of becoming what he most despises? Depending on whether you're an ambitious go-getter or a couldn't-care-less daydreamer you might find the answer a little less than straightforward. The ending itself is brilliantly surprising and just when you think it ends it doesn't quite. Fantastic.

As some other viewers have noted, it has certain similarities to To Die For; Election doesn't have quite as much technical and verbal brilliance, and its humor is more low-key, but on the other hand it doesn't caricature its characters quite as much and has a little more warmth.  No belly laughs here, but plenty of understated humor that bristles with intelligence and psychological insight.  (In one scene, an alienated, rebellious lesbian teenager is being lectured by her parents; her silent reactions to their comments are quietly hilarious.)The fact that there are no real good guys in Election, no one you can whole-heartedly root for, may be a turn-off to some viewers, but it's also what gives the film its complexity.  To some extent, we identify with Jim McAllister's loathing of the grasping, humorless control freak Tracy Flick. But when Tracy says that Mr. M. resented her so much because he felt stuck in an unsatisfying routine while watching many of his students go on to far more glamorous and successful lives ... well, she has a point, doesn't she. (Incidentally, I thought that using multiple narrators was a great touch!) And we also see that to some extent, his hatred of Tracy is driven by frustrated sexual desire.  While Jim McAllister's plight elicits sympathy, to say that his actions aren't admirable is an understatement.On the other hand, Tracy isn't just loathsome; her loneliness occasionally makes us feel sorry for her (though that side of her -- the yearning for human contact, which was obviously the primary motive behind her affair with the teacher -- isn't developed enough).  We also see that her single-minded determination to succeed at all costs is to some extent born of desperation, coming as she does from a relatively disadvantaged background as the daughter of a lower-middle-class single mother.  One can even understand her resentment of dumb (but nice) jock Paul Metzler's easy popularity.At least one IMDB reviewer has complained that Election puts down the work ethic by turning Tracy -- the only character with ambition and determination to make something of herself -- into the closest it has to a villain.  I disagree.  I personally dislike the term overachiever, which implies that too much achievement is a bad thing.  However, true achievement is about following your dream and excelling at something you love to do and something you have talent for.  The very fact that Tracy is involved in so many activities strongly suggests that she has no real passion for any of them, she just wants to get ahead in any way she can.  She's not an achiever so much as a status-seeker, a politician in the worst sense of the word -- adept at using cliches like I care about each and every one of you and when you vote for me, you vote for yourself, obsessed with things like perfect campaign posters, and sincerely convinced that her fellow students should be grateful to her for meaningless work like cleaning up group photos for the yearbook.Some people have compared the Tracy Flick character to Bill Clinton.  It's not a perfect analogy -- Bill is far more charismatic and much better at making people believe he actually cares about them.  But I guess you could say that Bill drives his enemies crazy in a way they can't fully explain, just as Mr. M. says of Tracy!In addition to a good script with crisp dialogue, Election is distinguished by excellent performances all-around.  Matthew Broderick is at his best here, showing his range an actor (very refreshing, after execrable trash like Godzilla and The Road to Wellville).  Reese Witherspoon is simply wonderful.  I've enjoyed her performances even in movies I didn't care for, such as Cruel Intentions and Fear.  She is one of those actors who can convey a lot just with their body language and facial expressions, and she certainly shows it here, in a role that often requires her to shift from sunny perkiness to grim rage in the blink of an eye.  Her facial expressions in the scene where she thinks she has been caught doing something that will cost her the election (I won't give it away), and her reaction when she realizes she can blame someone else, are priceless.Chris Klein was touchingly goofy as Paul, and Jessica Campbell did an excellent job as his alienated adopted sister Tammy.Another thing I liked about the film is that many of the characters are average-looking.  In today's Hollywood, this kind of realism is refreshing.Looking at the comments on IMDB, I noticed that a number of people complained either because the movie was too sexually graphic, or because the sex scenes weren't really sexy. Come on, folks.  This movie is rated R so it's not exactly like you weren't warned!  A lot of teen sex comedies are far more explicit (and far less intelligent).  As for the sex not being very erotic, that was obviously on purpose.  The movie, after all, is a satire. The dullness of the marital sex between Jim and his wife underscore the overall drabness of his life.Election is not without flaws.  The subplot involving Jim McAllister's extramarital affair dragged a bit, and was rather predictable (though hardly incidental to the main plot the fact that his personal life is unraveling is part of the reason he allows his hatred of Tracy to goad him into taking a highly imprudent step).  The scenes at the end showing Jim's new life were too long -- but I loved the finale!

It was refreshing to see Matthew Broderick get back to doing some good work for a change.  I'm referring to the lousy job he did in 'Godzilla'; in my eyes he desperately needed to revalidate himself, which he managed to do in 'Election' in an exceptional form (speaking of form has he been working out? those upper body muscles really looked good on him too!). Reese Witherspoon was terrific, I loved hating her! Though I don't consider myself to be an expert in the field of screenplay and cinematography and the likes, I thought the various scenes where images were frozen gave a special dimension to the movie; especially the scene during the counting of the vote, that was absolutely my favorite. The movie in itself, of course, is about more than just high school politics.  It's about real life, in all its dimensions of good and bad, innocence versus deviousness, justice and injustice.  That's what makes this movie so refreshing.  For once the official critics (see External Reviews) were right an overwhelming majority seems to agree that this is one great movie.

(Excuse me, but that IS what this movie is about, isn't it?)  For my money it is high time movies started doing this, paying more attention to ethics, and this is one movie that really cuts the ethics debate.  Trust me, this movie will be studied in high schools for years!  And I should know; I'm one of those people who really see the stuff of 'Election' from an adult persepective going on every day.  I'm a high school teacher. What hurts about having seen this movie, though, is that all too many will watch Election, and laugh at the loser for sleeping with Traci (and I agree, it serves him right!), yet secretly admire Traci for her tough-mindedness, determination and ultimate victory.  Does anyone REALLY despise her for her naked ambition?  No.  Does anyone REALLY really think for a second that Mr McAllister has a dog's chance in hell of stopping her?  No.   Does anyone care for two seconds that Tammy's de-railing attempt of the election all stems from her 'rejected lover' angst?  No.  And how many high school kids identified with the cheering mob at the possibility of no more student elections?   Millions?  Who cares?  Don't get uptight about it!  It's just a movie!  It's not like it's real for crying out loud! But what is real, is that many viewers (and not a few reviewers!)flatter themselves with; Oh yes, clever me...

I think those with this attitude aren't doing the movie justice.Facts are, this is a damn fine movie...and not just because Reese Witherspoon and Matt Broderick portray Manipulator and Out-of-his-depth Romantic so well.  Nor because of its clever direction and sharp editing. It's great because its screenplay is a worthy adaptation of a damn fine novel with deep insights about human weaknesses. The movie's been called a black comedy - but it isn't, unless by 'black comedy' you mean it is a kind of tragedy.   And the tragedy here is that one evil (naked ambition) brings out all the worst everywhere else (lust, pride, misplaced idealism). And what's really sad, is that the message we're left with is that to be untouched by evil, you have to be a likeable dumb jock. This movie cuts.

This school looks like a school and the characters look like teachers and students--costumes, houses, cars, and haircuts.  I later watched the film with Alexander Payne's commentary and discovered that this film was made in a working high school in Nebraska, and most students and teachers in the film were actual students and teachers.  Election looks real.However, what makes Election an excellent film is its characters. This is not a film which gives us a good vs. evil with one character who we can root for.  Rather, every character is both good and bad.  Each character has good and bad traits.  This is real life.  Especially standout are the performances by Matthew Broderick, Reese Witherspoon, and Jessica Campbell.  But every supporting role deserves accolades for their contribution to one of the most solid casting jobs in any recent film.

There is also a subplot focusing on Matthew Broderick's personal life which I found pretty boring (yet underdeveloped). The main strengths of the film would have to be its humour, the direction is also good with some innovative ways of introducing the characters. The characters, although stereotypes, are well drawn, pleasing to watch, amusing and well acted. Reese Witherspoon is spot-on as the prissy overachieving Miss Perfect and Chris Klein reprises (or pre-prises?) his American Pie role of a dumb but very likeable sports star.

Here again he shows his subtle hand at understated comedy.  He is just fine as the teacher who is drawn into a high school election,  simply because he cannot stand to see the annoying, overacheiving,unopposed candidate for student body president win without a race.  That candidate is played by Reese Witherspoon, who is totally believeable as the high school senior with one thing on her mind;WIN...WIN...WIN.  THE injured bodies she leaves in her wake as she pushes through to her goal is what this movie is about. And in examing the price of success the movie examines much of what is wrong with a society that places its only value in success.Witherspoons impact on all those around her leaves them all damaged.  If they challenger her they are beaten down, threatened, and forced to submit.  After they are dispatched and she has moved on to the next contest, they are forgotten, irrelevant to the immediate goal. And they are left to repair whatever damage she has done. That is not to say the injured parties are not responsable. They are.  Their own weakness causes their eventual downfall, not Witherspoon. But when a problem rises up to confront her it is the amoral singelness of her purpose that gets her through.  The others fall because they have a morality.They have an occassional weakness of the flesh.  She does not. This of course speaks volumes about our current politcal system.  Dont we all feal that most of our leaders, those that have risen to the top are nothing but a bunch of amoral, issueless, pointless, driven, self-centered,attention seekers, whos opinions change with the latest public opinion poll, and who wouldnt take an unpopular moral stand on anything even if their lifes depended on it.  This is Witherspoons character. Her whole being is one of connections, networking, and using people.  If your own board great. Until you are no longer needed.  If you oppose her she will try to crush you for no other reason than you stand in her way.  A great social commentary on what I believe we all feal about our political leaders.  There is not a real person in the bunch. Ironically her two opponents in the election eventually get exactly what they have always wanted.  Thats because they were no real opposition to Witherspoon.  They were just there as something of a joke.  For Witherspoon its real,  and she knows who the enemy is, and the enemy pays. And once the enemy is dispatched........well its on to the next contest.  She never looks back.  And cares nothing about the consequenses of her acts.  Thats because there is no morality in her game.  There is only one thing;WIN...WIN...WIN. Great charecters and a great script make this a good move.Not in the top 250 of all time...and I suspect as it ages it will disappear from the list. Still a good movie and worth an EIGHT......

These actors and actresses looked and behaved as the situation would dictate. Though the movie is called a black comedy, which it certainly is, I think too often a movie that depicts realism is passed off as a so-called black or dark comedy.

Alexander Payne's film focuses on a variety of topics, such as ethics and morals, ambition, and maturity. However, despite Election's examination of these more profound motifs, the movie lacks a center to combine these themes.  The film's story revolves around a school election that affects all of the film's characters in different ways and that ultimately dramatically influences their lives. While this election is the movie's main plotline, the film tends to wander off into the lives of the main characters outside of the election, especially Matthew Broderick, who plays a teacher in the school who has a somewhat peculiar interest in influencing the outcome of the election. Reese Witherspoon, on the other hand, is a student who is the leading candidate to be elected school council president.  Witherspoon gives a very convincing performance as a workaholic, fiercely determined student whose ambitions dominate her life.  Broderick's character is perplexing, as his actions concerning the election and his behavior in his personal life often lack rationality.  There are a few witty and politically satiric moments in the movie, but on the whole, the script is not very comedic or intelligent.

This movie sets the standard for mixing teen angst, adult themes, and wonderful performances in a comedy that's more real than we would like to admit.  The picture, using unique camera movement and a witty script, takes the people we all grew up with and runs them through the farce that is the process of allocating power in America. Broderick plays the everyman masterfully.  Witherspoon shines as the passive aggressive, over achiever.

But in scene after scene it keeps breaking out of the limiting stereotypes. This is a great film about life taking in its ups and downs.One thing this very good script shows is that people often do things and don't really know why. From being an over achiever and running for a school office or falling in love to having an affair many characters make decisions or are driven to do things which they can't explain. Another insight is that people's lives often collide with very unpredictable results. Love, respect or resentment can come and go very quickly because someone with little warning shows up or leaves. Mixed up with this is the unpredictability of getting caught or not breaking the rules and how this can completely change a life.The boredom of a midlife crisis is well played by Matthew Broderick as a teacher. Reese Whitherspoon does a fine job as the over achieving student who may be looking for a father figure and seems to have been seduced by her former instructor. Both characters are afraid and resentful of each other but can't admit it half the time. Included are well written supporting characters from the jealous lesbian to her clueless good hearted brother with all the main characters giving their point of view and getting swept along in a plot with many surprises.It is refreshing to see a movie with teenagers and not have someone pretending to be in charge or to have smart kids and dumb adults.

Election is a savvy and funny satire about urban life, a very entertaining film indeed; twanging sharp tipped arrows into all sorts of targets and most of them bite deeply. Sexual politics and the type of people who become political candidates get a big but affectionate serve.	Tracy (Reese Witherspoon) is a final year student at an American high school who savagely wants to win her school election and become the president of her school student body.	She's fussy, aggressively conservative and above all extremely ambitious. She's the type who's got her arm up eagerly begging to answer every question during class. She hasn't got many friends but recognises this to be the price of greatness. She's calculating and a world beater.	Her teacher Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick) is a little dowdy, mindful of his career, reasonably happily married and not overly ambitious. He's proud of the fact that he's been chosen as the teacher of the year three times and cares about his students. He's slipped into a pleasing routine which includes running the student election.	Things start to go wrong when the teacher develops an intense dislike for Tracy, a feeling that would probably not have developed except for some fairly unrelated but torrid personal reasons.The teacher decides to try to stop Tracy being elected. He reasons that if he can stop her now well maybe he'll ring one bell for the nicer, more caring people who might want to get into politics.	Election takes a good deal of its strength from the way its told. Director and co writer Alexander Payne (Citizen Ruth 1996) has structured it with voice overs such that many points of view are given. He allows the satire to flow in all directions. A disabled fellow in a wheel chair is elected unopposed as Vice President to luke warm applause. Someone else professes his love for a sibling in spite of that person having been adopted.	No one is sacred, although the tone is never nasty. Tracy is even likeable in many ways for all of her faults.  	If it's true that there are three types of people in the world those who make things happen, those who watch things happen, and those who wonder what the hell happened, then Election gives good examples of all three.Sometimes two hours of film seems to gather within it a good deal of life's experience.For example the consequences of having sex with the wrong people in Election are disastrous, just as the consequences of deceitfulness and ambition can be fruitful. On the other hand it's obvious that not having much of an idea about what is going on can be a definite positive advantage.The satire in Election is heightened by a scintillating performance by Reese Witherspoon as Tracy Flick. Man In The Moon (1991), Freeway (1997) and last year's Cruel Intentions has signaled an actress with an ever increasing range and effectiveness.She's still doesn't look too old for these parts and certainly wasn't out of her depth in Election where as I've said we were able to still sometimes like the niceness that was somewhere hidden beneath her pleated skirts, brushed down hair and forcefulness.Election also accepts that people's motivations for their actions are often murky especially to themselves, as well as being multi faceted. Films that lurch sometimes uncomfortably beyond single issue decisions and personalities is a delight and makes for very good film making.I expect that not everyone will enjoy Election; it's far too lethal for that, but it's a relief to see these sorts of films pop up every now and then on the mainstream circuit.

It was much more painful than I expected, especially Matthew Broderick's emerging cluelessness the part where he's preparing the room at a dead run was so painful I had to grit my teeth to not yell You're heading for disaster!!! at the TV (I watched this on video). Even at the end he's unaware of what really happened. There are a couple of points I haven't seen others mention the first is the lack of sympathetic female characters. I wonder if the script seemed as misogynistic to anyone besides me (though, come to think of it, none of the men are very likable either). Both of the wives are completely unforgiving (and understandably so, but still ...) and all the teenage girls come from the Cat Scratch school of teen girlhood. The other point is how this film uses the same material as the much-ballyhooed American Beauty. Of course the plot is a different pattern, and the other film is much more startling (though not really any more original), but many of the issues are the same high-school girls, older married fellows surprised by their lack of control over their libido, the dark side of teen society, the seamy underbelly of middle-class America, yadayadayada. Here, the humor has a different flavor; this is a black satire and the other is a comedic tragedy. I didn't like this film so much as I admired it.

ELECTION has all the sophisticated humor of RUSHMORE crossed with the fatalistic sardonicism of AMERICAN BEAUTY.Flick pits SGA candidate Flick (Tracy, by name - played superbly by big DICK star Reese Witherspoon) against average joe teach Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick, in a casting triumph).  Over-achiever Tracy is confident that she'll make her student opponents eat dirt.  Sharing the ballot are knockout newcomers Jessica Campbell as a teen lesbian who seeks to upset Tracy's apple cart and Chris Klein as a dumb jock at loose ends from a skiing mishap.  Klein is so wonderfully earnest he can convincingly thank God for what I'm told is a large penis during his nightly prayers without making it seem jokey or out of character.The nightly prayer sequence, while certainly not new, feels surprisingly fresh under Payne's lens.  Payne also incorporates images of straight lines for the angular Tracy and round circles for the dulled-down McAllister. Also watch for the garbage motif.  No, Payne is not obsessed with the Nebraska Waste Disposal System.  As confessed on the DVD alternate audio track, Payne is foreshadowing the major turning point in ELECTION with trashy visual hints.  Honest Abe and The Garden of Eden's taste temptation are also subliminally drawn into the proceedings in a sly way.Payne's most dramatic device, however, is the casting of former Ferris Buehler teen-rebel icon Broderick in the turnabout role of the hapless teacher.  Payne's final fadeout is a hilarious hoot of a tribute to FERRIS BUEHLER and his Ben Stein educator.  Yes, boomers, as Payne-full as it may be, our Ferris has grown up.Ballot box stuffers should remember to vote for ELECTION during the Oscar race.

You have to be clever yourself to appreciate all the funny things about human nature that take place in this movie.

The only difference is that Adam (Matthew Broderick) wants to prevent Eve (all of them) from her corruption.  You don't believe me?  Look for all of the apples strategically placed throughout the film.  I count three.  How about you?In addition, the film is a social satire.  Everyone had these kids in their high school.  Some of you may have been these kids, come on, you know who I mean.This movie is hilarious in both style and gender dynamics.  The style is brilliant with its freeze frames, interludes, and complete acts of seeming-randomness all in the name of set-up.The gender dynamics are also hilarious with Broderick's temptations by women and how he gives into them one way or another (whether it be sleeping with them or rigging the election), he can't win. For example (and this film is filled with them), Broderick is tempted to sleep with a friend of the family (actually he is seduced) and then she tells his wife that it was his fault. Is it?  Yes and no.  After all, she seduced him also.  The bottom line, are men pigs or is it just our weakness for women's temptations?  I'll choose number two.

What makes the film Election stand out is that the characters in this story don't make it as far as the White House, the Senate or even City Hall.  The election race in this story is for high school president.Matthew Broderick plays Jim McAllister, a political science teacher at Carver High.  He oversees the electoral process of which Tracey Flick (played wonderfully by Reese Withersppon) is the only candidate.  Tracey fits somewhere on the spectrum between Marcia Brady and Atilla the Hun. She is perky and pretty, but she is also self serving and far too ambitious for a respectable midwestern girl.  Tracey isn't popular at school but this doesn't seem to bother her.  We learn early on that even a nasty little sex scandal can't hold her back.One can assume that McAllister doesn't like Tracey very much, and one can see that he doesn't trust her.  He recruits Paul Metzler, (Chris Klein) into the race for presidency.  A former football hero, Paul's sports career came crashing to an end in a skiing accident.  It seems like Paul would be a shoe-in, not only for his heroism, but also because people feel bad that he is a has-been.The story moves along very quickly.  Subplots are cracked open at every turn.  Paul's sister, Tammy (played by Jessica Campbell) claims she is not a lesbian, but rather, she just happens to be attracted to women.  When Paul inadvertantly steals her current girlfirend, she retaliates by running against him for president.The characters are constantly struggling to deny their true feelings, in favor of the supposed high road.  McAllister knows that Paul's victory would be based on a popularity contest, but he rationalizes that this is best for the school and even for Tracey.  Tracey is furious about Paul's last minute decision to run against her, but she assures herself that this challenge is a good thing.Broderick stepping into a classroom (this time as a teacher) is reminiscient of the classic film, Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  In several scenes he asks a question of his students.  While he waits patiently for a student to respond (of course Tracey's hand is up all the time, much to his discomfort) I kept waiting for him to utter the line Anyone?  Anyone?Tracey Flick emerges as a new kind of villain.  She is a career-hungry student not to be messed with for she knows the game.  While McAllister dislikes her, he treads lightly for she is dangerous, and any misunderstanding could be career limiting.  Flick believes in her own self-righteousness, and anyone who might disagree cannot be a good person. As she states at the start of the film, 'this would never have happened' if McAllister didn't 'get involved.'While the character of Paul was well played, it remains for me the only unoriginal aspect of the film.  The football jock who runs for class president claiming he should be elected since everyone considers him 'well proportioned', is clever, but it has been done before.  Even cut down to size by a broken leg, the dumb jock feeling sorry for himself (but still getting by with the babes) isn't  memorable.On the other hand, the character of Tammy, Paul's sister, is something we haven't seen before.  Like her brother, Tammy chases after the girls. Unlike her brother, she is smart, bitter and hugely unpopular.  Her campaign slogan I'm not going to do anything for you.' sums up her anger.Election is quirky little dark comedy.  This film isn't for all tastes.  As with other black teen comedies, (Heathers and Scream 2, for example) a twisted sense of humor would be an asset.

It's difficult to imagine a high school satire/ allegory that's more vicious than Heathers. Election comes very close.Election is one of those rare films that manages to do just about everything exceptionally well from its acting, its intelligent writing, and its hilarious direction, nearly everything functions flawlessly.Its greatest accomplishment by far is the depths to which it stoops in creating one brutally vicious satire (the bathtub scene, in particular). The film effectively lambasts the cut-throat, back-stabbing nature of Ivy League aspiration while serving as a nice allegory about the pervasiveness of self-aggrandizing behavior in today's society. It's also quite amusing to apply the characters that are so complexly developed here to the current candidates for US president. I won't name any names, but you have the ruthless if personality-deprived competitor, whose every move has been meticulously pre-calculated to ensure success, the not-so-bright guy who happens to ride a wave of popularity, however unfounded, to heights of achievement. I could go on, but this movie is about much more than that. And Reese Witherspoon, in some shape or form, manages to embody just about everyone with whom I went to high school. Some people have criticized this film for being unrealistic, but I don't think I've EVER seen a movie that so perfectly captured just how stupidly and unnecessarily competitive high school can be. Seeing this movie in the early summer made me realize how ECSTATIC I was about being a college freshman this fall... Things can get terribly ugly in the top 5%, and Election fully realizes and ridicules this fact. It's just a pity that the Oscar Gods will fail to recognize the depth that Witherspoon, an actress whom I had previously found unremarkable, brings to the nefarious Tracy Flick. It's one of the best performances by an actress of ANY age that I've seen in quite a while. If Helen Hunt can win an Oscar for her work in As Good as it Gets (which I am NOT bashing-- that's a great movie with fine performances...) then Witherspoon should AT THE VERY LEAST earn a nomination. Her performance is really that amazing.And the other performances are no less effective-- Matthew Broderick especially, in his most anti-Ferris role to date. And both Election itself and Chris Klein get bonus points for creating a 'jock' character who isn't the stereotypical misogynistic prick; Paul Metzler actually has a conscience-- a novel concept for a cinematic football hero NOT portrayed by a certain Dawson's Creek troll.The ending is also a most pleasant surprise-- while it is, in one sense, a happy ending, it also leaves some uncertainty; each character, in some way, is left with an emptiness because of the things that have occurred. The reason that the satirical element of Election works so well is that NONE of the characters is able to pinpoint the source of their emptiness, if they recognize it at all.Rating 9 out of 10. By far the best comedy of the year, and hands-down the best movie ever to have an MTV Productions logo at the beginning. But don't let that fool you-- unlike its parent company, Election actually knows how to be pointedly intelligent. Much more than a mere 'high school' or 'teen-oriented' film.

Still, I'll try.Election has the illusion of being a more-than-slightly perverted high school comedy, while it is, in reality, a stunningly sharp work of satire whose aim is far, far beyond any election for student council president.  It's an especially good piece of film because of how realistic the characters are, for the most part.  We know people like Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon), the type who always has their hand raised first, and knows full well that they know the perfect answer, the overzealous overachiever.  We also know people like Paul Metzler (Chris Klein), dim-witted Mr. Popularity, the guy who everybody loves and can do no wrong, and of course, his jealous sister (Jessica Campbell) who is always in his shadow.  We also know people like Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick), the hard-working, dedicated high school teacher who wants nothing more than to reach the students, to really make a difference.Or do we?Election is about that question, I think, because everyone of these characters has a tragic flaw.  Actually, tragic flaws, because there are quite a few.  Initially, these inconsistencies are presented in ways that take us so off-guard they can be nearly offensive if one isn't ready for them.  And yet, do we really dislike any of the characters?  I didn't, that's for sure.Compare this criteria to contemporary politicians.  Take, for example, Bill Clinton, a dedicated, lovable sort of guy who everybody really likes.  Oh yeah, and there was that little Monica Lewinsky thing.  It's that sort of thing that turns the Election characters inside-out, realistic and unbelievable at the same time.There is one more thing I really must point out, because I didn't realize it immediately after seeing the film.  What you should know is that the film has a nearly happy ending, which is why the ending seems to stretch out for so long.  Every character has, in a way, accomplished their real goal, their dream.  And yet, there is certainly more than a little emptiness inside all of them, and they realize it too, of course.**** out of ****.

And while I'm glad that Hollywood is realizing that high school is not like that, I'd also like to hope that there is a happy medium between that and this. First of all, the sexual elements were so in your face that I was embarrassed. Anybody with any morals whatsoever would be, I hope.This movie did have some redeeming qualities. Chris Kline (I think that's his name) did a good job in his debut as the dumb, yet lovable, jock. Matthew Broderick is a favorite of mine, so anything with him in it isn't too bad.

Bored with his own life, he tries to punish Tracy for. . . perhaps for refusing to be a victim. Broderick's performance is without ego, a gift, the image of a soul in purgatory.  Reese Witherspoon is a perfect foil.  Combine these two talents with the direction, story, and script (Alexander Payne and Tom Perrotta) and you have a tale of Biblical implications.

Witherspoon was chosen for the role of the ghastly Tracy Flick, but she can really act (which was a surprise especially after Cruel Intentions and Fear).  Matthew Broderick's character was more hilarious, though, because the manner in which he attempts to drive morals and ethics into his students minds and later attempts to have an an extra-marital affair is breathtaking.  The movie ends on a note that I wasn't sure about, but upon more thought, I do believe it made its point.

I saw a special sneek preview and the theater was packed with high school teenagers who attended the school where it was filmed, just to see if they were in it. I sat down and as the movie began, I was laughing pretty early in. I thought the freeze frame on Reese was hilarious and I was having a pretty good time. The film had its shocking ( sex scene where Broderick is picturing Witherspoon, and many others. ) I laughed because I was in a good mood, and who knows, maybe I had a perverse mind state but I was reasonably happy. Then it turned toward Broderick having an affair, and the movie gradually fell flat for me. It became slow and all together unenjoyable, despite the scene where the lesbian sister takes blame in order to get into an all girls school. I didn't laugh to much either. I myself would say it was okay. The other teens in the audience were loud enough to let me overhear and 90% said that they hated it. I guess I was a minority. So, I suppose I'd reccomend it to adults or mature teens. it's a morality tale and a satire which has good performances, yet has its downs placed in especially Broderick's affair. It's not the usual teen movie, and surprisingly it's from MTV which brought us the brain dead and unbelievably crappy Joe's Apartment. See it, yet don't have too many expectations.

But really, that's how people talk in real life (not me, but people I know ;)).  I was also a little embarrassed for the women sitting in my row during some of the overtly sexual parts.Most telling for me was how I felt at various times during the movie. Without giving away critical plot points, let's just say that despite the poster incident, I found myself on Reese's side after the election results were announced.  I felt that what Matt's character did was wrong, despite the un-likeability of Reese's character.

Broderick perfectly varnishes the hidden desire and rage inside a principled nobody; and Reese Witherspoon gives a great performance as a resentful, pit-bull-like go-getter whose button nose, narrowing eyes and helmetlike hair are like a turtle's carapace, blocking the world's aggressions.This picture--probably the best-written comedy since BARTON FINK--is full of delights, like the rich, popular jock (usually a figure of terror or mockery in American movies) who turns out to be a flawlessly saintly sort of holy idiot. And Payne makes the fluorescent-lit classrooms, chain dining experiences and bit players look the way they look in life, not in dressed-up studio movies, without being strainedly realistic. The picture combines intelligence with a rampaging, chaotic sense of fun in a way that seems mostly lost in contemporary film; the movie seems to have been beamed in from another era. It was bunglingly sold by Paramount and quickly squashed by the work of George Lucas; Alexander Payne, like his protagonist, like his mentor Bunuel's heroes, must by now have learned the hard way that nice guys finish last.

Already this year there have been countless inserts into the genre that completely fail to entertain. I can count on two fingers the number of those films I actually  enjoyed. Election, is a one of a kind production, not necessarily fitting into the adult or teenage category.I refuse to call this a teen based movie. However, teens may enjoy the film just as much as adults. It is not limited in its point of view as many are seen only though the eyes of teenagers in a high school glamorizing sexuality, drugs, violence and profanity. Don't get me wrong, there is a lot of sexual content, profanity and some drug use in the film, along with rebelliousness and disrespectful attitudes. But what I rave about is the fact that this movie isn't about how cool it is too do unmoral things, it's a movie of profundity and the message that there are indeed consequences for actions.Election is a smart, razor sharp satire with much in common with the 1997 comedy Wag the Dog Both movies take a serious subject and turn it into a comical situation with enough wit to success several movies. Wag the Dog was a little on the political side, however, and Election is focuses more on the life of a particular man rather than an entire nation. Never before has a movie contained such an easy to relate to thought line of events, understandable character motives and an involving script with such naturalness.

Director Alexander Payne also shows his mastery at utilizing music and audio effects to punctuate his characters' hysteria and/or paranoia.  There is an endless array of original comic treats here(the riotous freeze frames, the internal primal screams of Reese Witherspoon's go-getter Track Flick), a tribute to Payne's craftsmanship, which are a breath of fresh air given today's saturated teen comedy flicks which assume we are some kind of moronic drones.After being spoiled by Seinfeld and The Simpsons, I think we finally have a 90 minute film where the laughs are abundant enough to make you forget the time.Don't be mistaken, the theme of corruption here applies to the global political plane, too.  Who can seriously picture an honest Washington election?  Ultimately only one character is able to expose the high school election for the hypocrisy it truly is as even Matthew Broderick the high school teacher succumbs to violating his own standards.By the end of the movie, Broderick(and almost every character in the film) would be hard pressed to honestly answer his own question to his class at the inception of the movie, What's the difference between morals and ethics?Don't let the MTV Films label throw you.

This is actually in response to the comments that Election is vulgar, too sexual, and blunt.This is NOT a movie for children, though it is ABOUT them.  I am reminded of another ADULT film about teenage situations which might be perceived as a teenage film The Opposite of Sex.  Both films have teenage appeal, but are not meant to be seen by younger people.I would like to note that the film IS rated R.  I would also like to note that -- were this film set in a college or workplace instead of a high-school -- much of the sexuality and language would be dismissed.What sexuality, you ask?

Freeze frames with voice-overs hold the moment so we can reflect on it in retrospect with our characters, delve into the history and pick up our story later on.Reese Witherspoon shines as the outrageous Tracy Flick, the psychotic over achiever who seems to want nothing more than to be high school student council president. A clever sound effect is employed each time Tracy begins to lose her temper, giving us the feeling she's capable of anything in revenge. I never knew anyone remotely like her character, but if I should meet someone like that, I most certainly wouldn't take the time to get to know them better, but rather put some distance between them and myself. Having said that, I'm sure there are a lot of Tracy Flicks out there, with low self esteem and a confident, self assured veneer.Matthew Broderick's character is more realistic and therefore more engaging. He plays his part to near perfection. I unfortunately found myself wondering if the gray hairs added in were indeed fake, or simply let out for authenticity in the role, as Matthew does seem to be getting older.For teens watching this film, don't worry, it'll soon be over.

This isn't a high school in the vein of 90210, the actors wouldn't make it in Tommy Hilfiger ads. Shot almost entirely on location, it appears that almost nothing was changed- no repainting, building or reimagining of the buildings, no designer outfits for the actresses, no extras from central casting.Alexander Payne carefully injects the venom of the script, employing a smattering of techniques  aspect ratio, stock footage, freeze-frames, titles, split-screen, camera angles and framing.  The narration, intermittent and from several characters, is the most effective in a movie since Badlands, serving as ironic commentary (as opposed to unnecessary summation  ie, Gattica).  Thanks to these elements- and owing a debt to some superb editing -the film's multiple points of view enhance rather than detract.Election is more than a great high school comedy, though- it's an indictment of hypocrisy as lived out by middle America.  None of the characters are fully conscious of the consequences of their actions, and they all pay a price for being so oblivious.But something about the movie, brilliant as it is, troubles me.  While it does retain sympathy for its characters, my suspicion is that the audience is permitted to feel superior to them.  Election seems to be a confirmation of, not a challenge to, common perception and stereotype.  Waiting for Guffman, another brilliant film, gave me the same feeling, Both movies produce in their audiences laughter derisive and, ultimately, dismissive of their characters.Still, not since Guffman can I remember being so wonderfully uncomfortable at the movies.

For most of us, the words are interchangeable; for him, _ethics_ = a system for values and behaviors that you work out intellectually, and _morals_ = a system handed down by Authority, like the MORALs of old fables, or Christian morality.ELECTION asks what the difference is between morals and ethics and asks us to think about what we elect to do.What bothers me about the film is the alternative possibility, voiced-over by the overachieving antiheroine, that what counts is Election your destiny (in secular success and failure) as it is handed down from ... whomever or whatever, and which you accept--or resist and destroy yourself. More exactly, what bothers me is that the film may *endorse* this Calvinist view.Matthew Broderick's high school teacher may fail so utterly not so much because of his choices and self-deception but because he's unElected natural man, like the proto-humans in the museum he ends up at. His guilt is his desire and his struggling against the dull, boring life in which he finds himself.I hope I'm wrong, but I think MTV just funded something fairly rare puritan satire of the Zero Tolerance/Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God variety, only without God.  The fate of Mr. M. would be a just punishment for an aging Ferris Bueller, but it seems like cruelty to some poor schlemiel of a high school teacher (schmuck, to be more exact, if IMDB will use the word), a guy whose misdeeds are far less than those of characters in the film who end up much better off.

Election, though it's not as daring a film, tackles the same themes more subtly.  Watching it a second time would be as enjoyable as the first time because the story is packed with intelligent detail.The film veers suddenly from everyday high school trivia to lurid sexual fantasy and perversion.  Sometimes this is awkward and raunchy, but more often its hilarious and, one of the best parts of the film, weirdly erotic.The underlying desire of the secretly vengeful do gooding civics teacher (Matthew Broderick, excellent in a role that's a welcome change of pace for him) for his wound to the squeaking point, seemingly virginal class presidential candidate (Reese Witherspoon, funny though over the top) drives the plot and makes for a bizarre but on target probe into the seamier side of main street Americana.Election succeeds because, while it doesn't shy from its characters depravity, it also doesn't judge them for it.  On the contrary, that seems to be the point of the film  your average high school class president and your everyday tax-paying, teacher of the year, neighbor next door are just as big a cauldron of steaming hatred and perversion as you underneath it all, that's what makes them so much more interesting, likeable and hilarious than what usually makes it through the Hollywood movie mill.

And it is an MTV productions movie too!!  When I saw that spaceman, I thought, on no, a brainless high school movie, but it turned out to be smart.  The best part about this movie is that it is relatable.  Who has not seen somebody obssess over anything trite and meaningless?  Who has not seen somebody who is nice, but hell-bent on revenge? Who has not hated somebody for being little miss perfect?  These are all people that you will see in Election.  I am not sure that everybody will like this movie.  In fact, I think that those who cannot think for themselves, or those who strive to be the absolute best, will even laugh at this movie.  The people who push everybody else over to be the best, while still kissing butt, will take offense.   But...the rest of us do not care because we hate that type, or at least I do.  This movie was not brainless, moronic, and actually took on many aspects of today's society. Tammy Metzler, and Mr. McAllistar were not exactly stereotypical, and the movie was the better for not having everybody be static.  Paul, and Tracy Flick (Grrrr!) were stereotypical, and static, but you do see these types in high school life.  Those of you who are sick of tear-jerkers, happy happy movies, whether they are comedies or not, and the typical action movie should see this, especially if Star Wars is sold out.  This should be your second choice, although I wanted to see this more than Star Wars, and feel it would be better. See this movie.

A funny, but plausibly impaired, comedy that begs the audience to think for itself.Matthew Broderick might be a dream on the Broadway stage, but lately the film career seems to have been working against him.  With Election, Broderick proudly returns to the performances we all love him for.  As a sex-starved high school teacher, Broderick and Payne make sure to form the character about as real as cinematically possible.  This is a comedy, but Broderick does a great job showing the character's many colors. Reese Witherspoon is no favorite of mine.  Repeatedly, I have winced at her performances.  She's certainly one of the least talented of her peers. Yet this film actually asks Witherspoon to stay within the confines of a character.  She does a nice job as Tracy Flick - perpetual overachiever. She plays with Broderick well, and she creates a memorable performance. The real star is director Payne.  With Citizen Ruth, Payne displayed a rare gift for satire and originality.  Election continues this streak with inventive camerawork, bright performances, and a distinctly sour screenplay.It's nice to see typical characters like the high school jock (a wonderful Chris Klein) and the blossoming lesbian treated with a slight spin.  They turn out to be the two sweetest characters in the whole movie. It's also nice to see actors and extras with imperfect beauty.  Zits, bad teeth, scary hair, it's all delightfully here. What makes Election quickly turn ugly is the refusal to end.  The movie has about 19 climaxes, 18 more than it needs.  I wasn't fond of the resolution of the film, only for the movie to take forever to finish. I doubt we needed such a lengthy summation. It damages the film's final impact. Payne has a bright career ahead of him.  I look forward to his clear vision in the future.----------- 7  "},{"Title":"well-acted,funny,and entertaining!","Date":"8 May 1999","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  election is a good movie.it's  well-acted,and entertaining.it's also  funny,and dark.this movie has a great  character study to it.something you don't  see very often in a teen movie.but that  doesn't mean it's more entertaining than a  couple of teen movies that came out this  year which are varsity blues,and ten  things i hate about you.however election is  the type of movie that gets better every  time i watch it.i might like this movie  more,and more each time i watch it.like i  did with the breakfast club.the more i  watched the breakfast club the more i liked  it,to the point that it's the best teen  movie i ever seen.election is not really a  teen movie.even though teenagers are in  it.election is a little better than  rushmore.it has more humor than  rushmore.and i think it's better  written.my rating for election could change  because like i said it's the type of movie  that gets better every time it's  watched.but for now i give election *** out  of **** "},{"Title":"funny as hell","Date":"8 May 1999","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  Fabulously funny movie that is much deeper and darker than any plot summary may suggest.

A movie about teenagers that isn't focused on pre-graduation soulsearching, make-overs, or prom night.  It's hard to believe but MTV has backed up a movie with a real message to it.  Stranger things have happened.I recently saw 10 Things I Hate About You.  I didn't find 10 things to hate about it and it was a fun little romp.  The main character in that movie was supposed to be cynical, but this movie is downright blackhearted. I enjoyed the fact that this film skewers all sides it presents to us. Yet while it distances you from the four main players you can still see where they're coming from.  I loved the monologues that the four main characters give at different points in the movie.  That shows us that all of them are in such denial about what is really going on in their lives. The 1990s are the perfect target of this film.  No one seems to ever want to accept that something they have done is wrong.Matthew Broderick surprised me.  He turned 180 degrees from his Ferris character.  He plays a high school teacher, Mr. McAllister, living a smothering boring life.  His clothes are drab, his wife and even the woman he fantasizes about are all plain.  He drives a car not even four clowns could fit into.  Did any of my favorite high school teachers regret the life that they chose, seeing their students on to lives that they wish to have themselves?Reese Witherspoon steals the show as Tracy Flick.  A raging hurricane of ambition, resentment, and pride.  She even has her own jungle cry theme music whenever someone crosses her.  I thought I would dislike her character from reading the reviews but I understood her motivations better after seeing the movie.  It's hard not to resent people that get things easily in life while you have to struggle.  It's hard to not be truly appreciated for overachieving.  She even begins to question whether her goals are even worthwhile.  However, she plans to win the student body president election at all costs.The second candidate, the stereotypical dumb jock is the only character that is pure of heart.  You think you would dislike his character but he is just TOO nice of a guy.  He cynically shows us that nowadays, it seems you would have to be an idiot in order to have any scruples.  His sister Tammy, miffed that her girlfriend left her and  hooked up with her brother decides to become the third candidate.  She wants to abolish the student government, saying it truly has no purpose.  While there is no contest to that, her motivation is questionable.Just watch this movie to see how events turn out and you won't be disappointed.  So many subtle touches were put into this movie.  The principal after learning of Tammy's proposal from her speech labels her as a dangerous element and suspends her.  Thinking back I'm sure that similar things happened at my high school, corrupt officials manipulated things to suit themselves.Election deals perfectly with one of the greatest teenager themes of all, infatuation.  Infatuation makes the characters so blind that they can't even tell whether their actions are right or wrong.  They justify the things that they do under the pretense of love and don't realize there are consequences to their actions.

However, I found the acting a bit too over the top. With a satire like this, I think you cannot waver at all, and I fault Matthew Broderick a little bit in this regard. He was good, but you can tell from the start that he doesn't believe in his character. The script also could be a bit more subtle in this way. But I DO like him taking roles like this. As for Reese Witherspoon, she's way over the top, but almost succeeds by just NEVER EVER wavering from the pitch she has set her character at.

Underage Tracy Flick is a bit of a sexual firecracker as well, and gets McAllister's best friend and fellow teacher fired after she has sex with him. (Reese is supposed to be only 17 here.) Witty, funny and clever, but not as much fun as I expected--and also dirtier. When Tracy Flick won the election, she should have turned a cartwheel, don't you think?

Her competitors in the election, the popular football player with a broken leg and his adopted sister with lesbian tendencies, contribute to the drama, but I didn't get some aspects of the sister's rebellious angst; yes, she'd been dumped by the girl she fancied who then got off with her brother, but why did she suddenly pursue a nihilistic, anarchistic cause during the election, ie Vote For Me & I Won't Do Anything....other than abolish the school council, something highly popular with the students.And Broderick's crisis, following a dozen successful years as a teacher.

I'd have thought it would have taken more stress to knock him off his stride, it certainly does in my case. It's all a matter of thresholds; you'd have thought it would have needed at least a couple of parking tickets or an eye-opening experience at a massage parlour. Nevertheless, reservations excepted, this is a witty, erudite movie which is pretty on the eye and shouldn't put you off student politics, at all. Here's power to your elbow.

Here is something closer to Citizen Ruth,a mock of politicians and politics,set in the very universal setting of a Midwestern high school.Teacher Jim McAllister(MAthew Broderick,now more remembered for his stage work than films anymore) loves his job as a high school history and government teacher/track coach. He is dedicated,principled and a true believer in the idea that democracies can be born through the young and malleable minds he works with. He also supervises the student council elections,where on one particular year,one particular student,one Tracy Flick(Reese Witherspoon,just another fantastic performance here),is not only a strong candidate to win the senior class president office,but in all likelihood,she's the ONLY candidate to run for it. Disturbed by Tracy's over-achieving persona(And a few other issues that cut deep for him,and that's all I'll give away about that),McAllister devises a plan to create a type of competition to break Tracy's hold on what would other be a forgone conclusion of a win.

At first she doesn't have any competition, but one of her teachers, James T. 'Jim' McAllister, has another plan. Because he wants the election to be more democratic and partly because he wants to satisfy some deep personal anger towards Tracey, he convinces Paul Metzler to run for president as well. Paul Metzler is a football player and one of the most popular guys in school (of course, who else? I'm European and not familiar with American schools, but if we have to believe the movies, than every popular student in high school is either a football player or a cheerleader). Of course Tracy isn't too happy with that, but to make things worse Paul's lesbian sister (don't ask me she why she had to be a lesbian and couldn't be straight) will be the third to start campaigning.Overall this movie has a weak story and an even worse plot. It's all too obvious and far from original. It really has nothing intelligent to offer, and to be honest, nothing funny either. In fact, I guess the only good thing about the movie was the acting.

That being said this is still a fun ride, and Reese Witherspoon deserved a Best Actress nomination for her hilarious portrayal of an over-achieving high school nerd, who if anything looks at high school as a high-class career, complete with backstabbing and jealousy.Election takes place in Omaha, Nebraska and tells us the story of how one teacher (Matthew Broderick) got fired for rigging a class election. He can't stand Tracy Flick (Witherspoon) because she's always trying to take over in everything she does, and this won't do. Election almost tries to see high school like the primary elections, where everyone is a sneak and everyone is fake. It even gives us the necessary affair Broderick has with his wife's best friend, which causes even more plot tribulation.Witherspoon's gifts in this movie are that her limited screen time enables her to come off even more brilliant. Simple gestures with her body language and hand gestures tell us she had come along way from Cruel Intentions and Pleasantville. And she plays a character we all can relate to. Every high school has at least a few perfectionists who take everything they do so seriously they irritate those around them.

For instance, there is a cleverly subversive scene where schoolteacher Jim McAllister asks school football star Paul what his favorite fruit is. Paul says, Pears. No wait! Apples. Mr. McAllister then proceeds, Great, now say that everyday you had an apple. An apple, an apple and more apples. You probably thought that apples were pretty good, even if you got a rotten one every once in awhile. Then one day there was an orange. Now you can choose, do you want an apple or do you want an orange? That's democracy. Paul then delivers the key line, I also like bananas. Indeed, every line is key. In some sense or another, they are all satirical punch lines. Each character narrates, so what we get are indeed apples and oranges. In their own unique ways, they let us know their take on each turning point that concerns them. Then when they all converge, like in a campaign rally scene in the school gym, we are aware of all contexts and perspectives, and what gets a reaction out of the student body and what leaves them quiet and bored hits several satirical bull's eyes at once.We recall classmates like Tracy Flick, the egghead who invariably has her hand in the air, while the teacher hopelessly scans for someone else to call on. She's one character in Alexander Payne's Election, an expert send-up about an election for student government president, a post Tracy craves to conquer to go along with her accumulation of every other prize in school. Tracy is played by Reese Witherspoon, who gave the seminal performance of her career in Election as a driven, calculating climber who tells Mr. McAllister she hopes they can collaborate harmoniously in the next school year.Jim McAllister's subsequent deception is the ironic and catastrophic truth that stands as the metaphor for contemporary US politics. He is in charge of organizing the student government, and begrudges Tracy for personal reasons, so he puppeteers the dim-witted, polite and hugely popular jock Paul, who can't play football this year, by pitting him against Tracy to draw out her vindictiveness. McAllister is played by Matthew Broderick, who narrates the film in a pitch tempered between awe and revulsion, and his performance is great in the sense of maintaining that equilibrium. Paul is played by Chris Klein in what might be his only truly good performance. Instead of a sweet walk-on hunk in a shallow teen movie, Payne exercises all of those qualities in him, the result being that he is perfect for the role.Perhaps my favorite character is Paul's sister, Tammy, the kind of student who is so completely her own person, so wise beyond her years, practically invisible in the shallow haze of Midwestern social mores, but that's no bother to her. She is dumped by her lover, classmate Lisa, who says that she is straight and was just experimenting. Lisa turns around to suddenly be Paul's new girlfriend and campaign manager, mostly to hurt Tammy. In response, Tammy runs for president too, with a platform that student government is all b.s. During the school assembly to hear their speeches, after Tracy merely gains a golf clap and Paul gets a strong reaction simply for his quarterback stardom, Tammy effortlessly voices an audacious speech reproaching the election and that she will get rid of the student government if elected. Thunderous standing ovation, followed by a total hair-pin turn in the story.Few commercially successful independent filmmakers of the 1990s cared as much about the incisive political realities of the Midwestern United States as Alexander Payne. Payne is a satirical filmmaker who doesn't take basic aim and bombard it. He stations in the center of his story and ambushes on all sides. Election is by no means just about a scandalous student. It's also about a weak teacher, inflexible authority, and a student body that is predominantly just coasting along until it can go out into the world and overrun useful room. The movie is not nasty about any of its characters. I kind of liked everybody some of the time (loved Tammy!), and even felt a little sorry for each one. Payne doesn't take pleasure in scapegoats and derision. What he's shooting for is an allegory for elections overall, in which the voters have to pick between the sorts of people who have been running for office ever since high school.

An added background of manipulating and manipulated people who are trying to live their perfectly normal lives just makes this the funniest thing since that last root canal.  Oh, I have no doubt that this movie was produced with a humorous objective.  Perhaps it is this new generation X humor where attempts to trash someone's life or property is so darned humorous.Actually this is a pretty good movie if you ignore the comedy billing.  I mean not only do criminals do their thing but each criminal in the move gets punished.  And in spite of the criminality life goes on for those who keep working at it.  The manipulation of time was seamless and superb.  The acting was excellent and the direction produced believable interactions.  I especially liked the role of the janitor character in the issuance of the coup de grace to the films protagonist(sic). Maybe, like BladeRunner, a directors cut of this film will remove the narration.  Then the jerk protagonist of the film will be relegated to his true, uncomedic, role.I rate this a 4 out of 5 for an excellent slice of high school life genre.  Witherspoon is always a must see.

Mat Broderick stars as a teacher, which scarily dates those of us who would have expected him to be playing one of the students. The teacher, supposedly a 9-year veteran who loves his job, for complex personal reasons attempts to sabotage the results of a student council election. This could have been a great film, with all manner of devious bastardry and backstabbing, and funny to boot.But something odd happened to this film. It seems to be aimed at a very young and dimwitted demographic. Why else the grotesquely exaggerated sex scenes (interesting, none of the adults portrayed in this film has what could be termed a healthy and satisfying sexual liaison - the teens get off relatively lightly, which bears further comment beyond the scope of this review), the extreme foul language, and the constant voice-overs that interrupt the flow of the film. The voice-overs, revealing the thoughts of all the major characters, are this film's major weakness. Why do we need them to know what the characters are thinking and feeling? These are actors, dammit, it's their job! It would be possible, I swear, to sit through this film with your tongue in the ear of the person sitting next to you, and you wouldn't miss a thing, the voice-overs save you from having to give the movie more than cursory attention. The denouement is also an exercise in the obvious, for anyone who had their eyes open in the first five minutes of the picture. Ditto the flimsy plot device that renders Broderick more physically grotesque as he carries out his devious work.Honestly if this film were any dumber, it would be a silent movie (Ouch! Am I allowed to say that these days?). Sheesh, it's even got a Keanu Reeves lookalike (Chris Klein) in the role of the dumb but decent quarterback turned candidate, Paul Metzler. Saving graces are robust performances by Reese Witherspoon as the nauseating frontrunning candidate Tracey Flick, and Jessica Campbell as Paul's troubled and troublesome sister, Tammy.

Matthew Broderick, fresh of the success of Godzilla, plays Jim McAllister.  Jim is a high school teacher who seems to be a little scared of the world around him.  Reese Witherspoon, Tracy Flick, is a senior at the same high school and running for student council president.  Tracy is the type of person that will do anything, and anyone, to get ahead.What this movie lacks in plot, acting, and directing, is also absent in EVERY other aspect of the film.  The only good thing that I can, and will, say about Election is that the director most certainly introduces us to each and every character thoroughly, which allows us to form our opinion of them almost instantaneously.  We learn that Tracy is a conniving little b*tch who like to kiss ass and then backstab to get her way.  We also feel sorry for Jim having to live his atrocious life of not being able to impregnate his wife, and eventually loosing his mind because of Tracy.I especially don't see the point, or maybe I am just missing it, for the bee sting to Jim.  It is completely irrelevant to the story, and completely unnecessary.  Not at any point in this movie could you hear my laughter.  I don't know what the director (Alexander Payne) was trying to do with the film, but I certainly didn't get anything from it.

My brother uses an expression whenever he finds something immature or lacking substance  He says it's So High-School.  And this perfectly describes Payne's way of dealing with the goings-on in his Election.Tom Perrota's story is wicked, and Payne is just the sort of moviemaker to bring it to the screen.  The ethics vs morals questions they pose are clever, but they don't echo in your head, because neither is serious about them.  Ethics or morals doesn't fit into a movie that is really about gamesmanship, who stands and who falls, who prevails and who doesn't, and the game is really so trivial, so high-school. That's why the character that really stands out is Paul Metzler (played ingenuously by Chris Klein). He is the only one in the story with any genuine feeling for Carver High and whatever principles it may stand for.  The laughs take on a whole different dimension, when Klein is on camera.  It's as if the smart, hip, cynical people did each other in, and when the smoke rises, all that's left is the tender-hearted jock with dreams of school carnivals, and student-made Haunted Houses dancing in his head.I take exception to the suggestion that all-girls schools are breeding grounds and potential hangouts for young lesbians.  Doesn't anybody go to school in the movies anymore for an education?  Even when I laugh at Tammy Metzler's election speech, the humor feels hollow.  Jessica Campbell has the best female role in Election, but where can you take a shunned gay teenager once she's dumped on a hetero-dominated club like co-ed high school?  Catholic school, of course; where else?As Tracy Flick, the overachiever with faculty in her past, Reese Witherspoon is too pinch-faced to be funny, and Matthew Broderick has aged badly.  He's half-slack-jawed, half-adolescent.  And he plays Jim McAllister broadly.  He's the one that should be pinch-faced and sneaky.  (He was at least sneaky in Ferris Bueller's Day-Off.)  Then we might see that this cold war that's being played out was between two of a kind.  Instead we're meant to hate one and love the other.  And why should that be when you expect a teacher to know better and a conniver like Tracy Flick to be incorrigible anyway?  For odd teenagers in commune, I like TV comedies like Dobie Gillis and Square Pegs more.

But it isn't going to be that easy.3-Paul Metzler (Chris Klein) he's a silly, very silly rich boy. He is popular, handsome, but just silly.

Reese Witherspoon and Matthew Broderick collectively symbolize and deride ambition, civic leadership, and a carefully cultivated veneer of respectability.  Mr. McAllister earned the love and support of his students and administration by always doing more than was expected, and by treating everyone fairly, but he was not a happy man.   When he tries to grab a little piece of happiness by bending the rules, he finds that he is no match for the monster of social propriety that he fed and clothed for many years.  You can play with it, you can set it to attack your enemies, but you cannot cheat it for very long without getting eaten alive by its rabid minions.Watching McAllister fall apart as his nemesis prospers is excruciatingly funny.  Matthew Broderick has a gift for playing clever but ordinary heros who react to rather than direct events around them, and his approach to this role is absolutely perfect.  He is an appealing comic hero symbolizing the nebbish hiding in all of us.  The slow pan over the woebegone visage of a museum caveman was the funniest sequence I can remember from any movie.Reese Witherspoon's Tracy Flick was just the type person Charles De Gaulle warned about when he said to never get between a dog and a lamppost.  She displays an amazing vibrancy in her performance.  It isn't that she is merely intense; she almost glows with energy.  There is no question that every molecule in her body is focussed on her life plan.  No wonder she makes her amiable classmates uneasy.  Witherspoon took a lot of risks with this character as the film is loaded with slow motion shots of unflattering facial expressions and exaggerated mannerisms.  She deserves high praise for her gutsy straight performance of the queen bee of over-achievers.There were no false or overplayed scenes in this film.  The presentation was tightly controlled and the actors remained low-key, letting the script present the comedy.  I did not expect to ever see a better high school satire than Heathers, but  Election was smarter without the bitter undertones of that film.  A story like this renews my faith in humanity.  The worst thing that could ever happen to our little crooked timber of human existence would be for it to look in the mirror and decide it was straight after all.

That seems really weird.I think they should have followed the story in the book.In general the movie moves too slowly and has too many voiceovers (and sex scenes). It might have gone somewhere, but as it is, it's falls flat. There might be a message in there, but it's buried in all the other trash piled on top of it.

Alexander Payne's direction is great, Jim Taylor and Payne's screenplay is near perfection.They portray these essential losers and all around shallow individuals to a perfect t.Reese Witherspoon is Tracy Flick the Miss Good Girl who is extremely smart, hard working, and knows who to sleep with.Chris Klein plays Paul Metzler and he is, well, he is good natured, but he lives in la la land and is a complete moron. And he stole his sisters girlfriend. Weird family.Matthew Broderick is Jim McAllister. Well, he is the most screwed up of them all. He has a good life. He has a good job, loving wife, and all that good stuff. Sure it is a little dull but most everyone's life is a little dull. But he isn't pleased with good. So he throws his life away. He is bitter and resentful, even if he is right. He is Kevin Spacy's character in American Beauty minus the balls.And this movie circles around them and a few other losers. It follows them through the school election for class president.As we watch this dark comedy and laugh at all these miserable beings destroy their lives and/or those around them, I can't help but wonder if that is healthy.Anyway, I think Election is a good movie. But I just didn't enjoy it. I liked no one and perhaps that is the point. Unlike Rushmore I couldn't look and see something redeemable about these people, nothing for me to at the very least like them in some small way.So, I give Election a 6.5.

To the extent that Payne has the courage to deliver a positive message at all, it's the one best expressed by Ambrose Beirce `It's not enough to tell me that you worked hard for your gold - so too does the Devil work hard.'But he muddies his message and dulls the story with needless cynicism.  The story is this Tracy Flick is running unopposed for school president, and teacher Jim McAllistar, unable to stomach her winning, `interferes with destiny' by convincing the school football star to run against her.  This simple scenario takes a while to set up, partly because it's narrated from four points of view, and all four of the narrating characters refer darkly to the dire consequences of McAllistar's interference.  After the tenth such reference we expect the consequences to be pretty damned dire an extended French bedroom farce culminating in an apocalypse is about the least that will satisfy us.  Needless to say, the denouement is a let-down.  It needn't have been quite so much of a let-down as it is.A lot of time is devoted to McAllistar's marital infidelity.  All of this time is wasted.  The story Payne is trying (or ought to be trying) to tell is one of a man whose life is derailed by that irresistible force of nature, Tracy Flick.  But most of the damage is done by things that take place outside the school and have nothing, whatever, to do with the main plot.  This isn't a true tragedy at all.  A true tragedy would have seen McAllistar done by a SINGLE character flaw manifesting itself in ONE train of events - and it would have been a better story.  But McAllistar is loaded with half a dozen flaws that don't even seem to be part of his true character.People who liked Gus Van Sant's `To Die For' should love this movie.  At any rate, they damned well OUGHT to, for while `To Die For' was contemptible rubbish, `Election' takes one or two of the more promising elements from the earlier film and actually makes something of them, if not something completely successful.  One thing that IS completely successful is Reese Witherspoon's portrayal of Tracy Flick.  Quite apart from the fact that any film with Reese Witherspoon in it must be worth watching, she conveys pure Flickness here all innocent eyes, menacing smile, clenched teeth and flared nostrils.

Why not just stick to the main story? Which is supposed to be the election...Instead the story drifts off into silly side stories about lesbian affairs, student/teacher love, and a man cheating on his wife with his best friends ex lover etc.....There is no need for these at all, as the main plot would have been strong enough to carry the movie through! My second complaint is that Broderick's character gets the majority of the screen time, therefore overshadowing Witherspoon and Klein's characters.....In fact you may at times forget you are watching a movie based on a high school election, as it seems to be a portrayal of the life and times of teacher Jim Mcallister (Matthew Broderick). Paul Metzler (Chris Klein) really suffered from this, and had minimal screen time.This film was supposed to be a comedy, but yet i rarely found myself even cracking a smile....It just wasn't very funny at all.Other flaws and plot holes are as follows....1) The chemistry between the lead characters was almost non existent. Broderick, Witherspoon, and Kleins characters were barely on screen together, which made it hard to get a feel for the movie.2) Brodericks hate towards Witherspoon was just unconvincing. She had not done enough in the film to warrant being disliked by him so much, that he would risk his job to fix the results of the election. Once again, they were rarely on screen together, and there was no chemistry between them.3) Chris Kleins character Paul was just not convincing enough as being 'Mr Popular'. He was too slow and dumbed down to gain much respect from anyone, and the character was under used and poorly written. The potential for this character could have been great.4) The scene where Tracy lost the election to Paul could have been so much better. Tracy barely showed any reaction to losing at the time, when what you were really expecting was for her to go completely nuts in front of the whole school. We were denied the pleasure of seeing this, and instead 'treated' to seeing her crying her eyes out at home.5) The ending was just ridiculous. Dragged out and boring. By this time the film really had lost its direction, and the ending just seemed like it didn't know what to do with itself, or which way to go.The film was OK in parts, but it just wasn't very good. And I am actually 'amazed' that there are so many positive reviews for this movie. Im actually baffled.....Did we watch the same movie?

She's extremely overbearing (and it does show in her actions), yet she's popular enough to win an election. She was a hard-working nerd, yet she sleeps with a teacher.

The overachieving Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) is a scheming witch. Loveable star athlete Chris Klein (Paul Metzler) is a dolt who doesn't have a clue when he's not playing sports.  His iconoclastic sister Tammy (Jessica Campbell)is a spiteful troublemaker. Granted there are a lot of real life students like Tracy, Chris, and Tammy. But there are also a lot of real life students who are nice AND intelligent. By ignoring these people, ELECTION presents a distorted picture of high schoolers.Teachers don't fare any better in this film. Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick) so pathologically despises Tracy's Machiavaellianism he descends to chicanery to ensure her defeat in the election.  His fellow teacher Dave Novotny (Mark Harelik) has an affair with Tracy. No well adjusted teachers are employed as major or even minor characters to balance McAllister and Novotny.What ultimately dooms ELECTION, however, is its aura of unpleasantness. The only decent major character is Chris Klein and his decency seems to be mocked as a sign of idiocy.  The filmmakers bombard the viewers with gratuitous graphic sex that brings the scenario (such as it is) to a halt.  Especially offensive is a scene where McAllister starts making out with Notovony's wife Linda (Delaney Driscoll) with her baby watching! Even worse, this scene's played for laughs!  Also played for laughs is a bit where a handicapped student runs for vice president!ELECTION reveals very little about high school.

There's no one in the movie remotely likeable.  Sure, there are people we can identify with, if we examine ourselves, for a little Tracy Flick flickers inside every one of us.  But of all the characters in the movie she's the only one who exhibits any laudable traits, lacking only one thing  any real kindness.  Although she's supposed to be the manipulative one, everyone else in the movie is more manipulative than she, and she herself is manipulated and abused by more than one character.  Although Broderick, in a fine, understated performance, seems to be meant for the emotional center of the film, he's a bigger jerk than Flick.  That there was not one minute of pathos for the corner of loneliness Flick painted herself into shows poor writing.  She never had one minute of self-examination or illumination;  and that's all that kept her from being one of the all-time great movie characters.  And it's too bad, too, because she was the only character in this confused and unpleasant road-kill of a movie that was in any way worth saving.  It shows what a lousy pass we've come to in this country that people who want to make something of their life and have any sort of work ethic are so casually abused and hated by theatre-goers.  Perhaps that's why there was, eventually, no introspection for Tracy Flick that led her to any  random acts of kindness, or any genuine feeling for another human being, (for which, surely, her mother was more to be blamed, another manipulator on poor Tracy Flick), she would have been *right*.  It seemed to be the point of the script that anyone who wants to actually accomplish anything, whether from selfish or unselfish intentions (we never saw any of the latter in this movie from anyone) can ever be right.  If Reese Witherspoon hadn't done such a good job on Tracy, who should've been the emotional center of the film, it would be poorly considered now;  and in a few years, save for that one performance, it will be deservedly shelved and forgotton, gathering dust on video-store shelves until its obsessive fans can buy all remaining copies from discount bins.
