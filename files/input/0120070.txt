[{"Title":"Quaid will make you cry.","Date":"29 January 2003","Score":"82 out of 86 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, War","Review":"  I suspect that for most Western Europeans and Americans the name 'Bosnia' is now no longer simply the name of a country, but also carries a subliminal implication of atrocity and ethnic viciousness.  I doubt, then, that many people would approach this film with any false expectations of what it will contain.That said, viewers should not come to this film for a political explanation of why and how the war happened - for that, it's probably best to read a few books.  This film does attempt to give a human explanation of how and why wars like this one happen and continue to happen, though.Inevitably, some have accused Savior of bias; though an American film, the director is a Serb, and it was filmed on location in Montenegro; with such emotive subject matter partiality would hardly be surprising.  Indeed, the film does not flinch from discussing atrocities committed by Bosnian Muslims.  Those who accuse this film of being pro-Serb, however, should consider that one of the most hateful caracters in the whole film, whom we witness carrying out pointlessly vicious acts of cruelty and mysogyny, and who happily admits to being a serial rapist, is himself a Serb.Viewers should instead look to the human heart of this film.  Dennis Quaid gives us a superb performance, rendering a character of some complexity (look at his expression when one character tells him 'You are a good man'). He is ably matched by Natasja Nincovic's complicated, battered portrayal of a Serb woman - and not merely a 'rape victim' stereotype that we know from other films.There is a religious subtext for those who like looking for such things - plenty of Christ imagery, chiming nicely with the title.  There is a special irony in the cross Joshua carries; apparently a Catholic, he has come to Bosnia specifically to kill Muslims in revenge for the loss of his family in a terrorist bombing - yet by joining the Serbs he is also aligned against the Catholic Croats.  Perhaps this says something about the self-destructive nature of his revenge, and about his own internal conflict.  This is a film about a man divided against himself, in a country divided against itself.It is particularly effective that the main character in this film is an American.  We are tempted to comfortably see him as 'one of us', a decent man in the midst of a barbaric war - but we are not allowed such passive comforts.  Eaten by revenge and pain, little seperates Joshua from his barbaric 'sidekick' Goran, whose mindless cruelty he meets with contempt but also inaction.  His own conduct is difficult to stomach, but nonetheless presented as the actions of a human, not a monster.What Antonijevic's film does, then, is look at the line between those who have, and those who have not, become indifferent to the suffering of others - it is in this way that the perpetuation of war is explored.  There are no politics, no discussion of religion, or of 'age old ethnic hatreds'.  The focus of this strong film is the simple human cost both in lives extinguished and lives mutilated by war.  Indeed, for those not very familiar with the details of the war in Bosnia, the practical anonymity of the different soldiers throughout the film will heighten the sense of War as something soldiers do to Civilians.People who respect and appreciate this film should steer clear of the recent Behind Enemy Lines however - it reuses fragments of the Lake scene in Savior to simplistically anti-Serb effect, completely bastardising the intent of the people who originally created those images.Nonetheless, despite what has been done to it Savior remains beautifully acted, tragic, mature film-making.

Probably it is in some way. I'm not from the Balkans, but I live very near and I remember very well that war in front of my door and I was against the Serbs. This movie was made by a Serb director and show his point of view. Anyway I think that in this movie you can see what was that war for civilian people, any side they were. I found it a true document about the war, and, in the end, I was not disturbed by the fact that it was a movie from a Serb director. I think that this demonstrates that it's a good movie. After watching this movie, you don't hate the Serbs, the Croatians or the Bosnians, you hate the war for the consequences on civilian people.

You can either see what they have to say, or see the next assembly line CGI garbage. I suggest that any mature moviegoer give this a look.  There is some unexpected humor, a lot of horror and carnage and heartache, and I do suggest you keep the tissues close by for a some incredibly emotional scenes. There is not a whole lot of dialogue which is also much appreciated. Most of the time actors are better when they have nothing to say but alot to express.  The actors in this movie are all very natural and real.  Not the least of which was the baby!  One of the best performances by a new born I've ever seen..this child is beautiful. Thanks to Dennis Quaid who probably made the equivalent of cab fare for this one..you did a great job in an invaluable movie.

Having seen his wife and son murdered by Muslim terrorists, Guy has become bitter and hard and is fighting as a mercenary for the Serbs.  When a prisoner exchange sees his partner take a girl he knows and try to kill her and her unborn mixed child, Guy is forced to kill him to protect them.  However he then finds himself in a bitter war with a woman and child that no one wants.I have seen this movie twice now and can find little to dislike about it, but also realise that it is not for a fun evening in with friends.  The film is unrelentingly bleak and depressing as it is a look at the bitter and cruel war fought in Bosnia.  The subject matter is framed around Guy, as a man who has been turned hard by the horror he has seen and it works well for this reason.  We see it through the eyes of a man who has seen it all and has no more hurt left to feel.  The film doesn't simply act out atrocities for us to watch but frames them within this story &#150; however we know that nothing is made up or exaggerated in terms of the bigger picture.The film lacks any sort of traditional American cop-out (it's no spoiler to say that Guys wife and child don't turn out to be alive after all!), only the opening `this is why he's like this' 10 minutes are a little too neat and could have been dispensed with &#150; I didn't need it to explain why he was dead inside, only that he had become it due to war &#150; which was partly true.  However this doesn't really take away from the film, only slightly weaken the character.The cast are pretty good but the film is 99% Quaid's.  He gives a great performance which is subtle and very downbeat.  His eyes are where most of the acting occurs and he does it very well &#150; his character is very unsympathetic and has only a marginal redemption to look forward to but yet Quaid mixes it very well.  Kinski is out of the film before her name has even appeared on screen, while Ninkovic does a good job, again despite a unsympathetic character.  The rest of the cast are OK but hard to judge as much of the dialogue is in Serbo-Croatian and their performances are hard to judge.  Faces such as Skarsg√•rd add interest, but I did wonder why he had bothered for such a short time on screen.Overall this is not a fun film to rent on Friday night but a bleak anti-war film that will leave you in no doubt that the conflict in Bosnia (and perhaps everywhere else) is of no value when compared to the enormous cost in terms of human life and suffering.

Usually what Stone touches turns to gold and this is no exceptionThis film will move you to tears; mark my words. I wasn't ready for it, or at least wasn't expecting it. Realism is the key to its power.While some viewers may focus on which ethnic groups are committing what crimes, for the wider audience I think it has a commentary on the human race in general and what it is capable of. Quaid performs his part from top to bottom, which drains the viewer of emotion, making one actually process information that has previously just been news broadcast.A good mix of local and international filmaking skills also present what I would consider an accurate picture of the racial and religious groups depicted in the movie. I'm sure insiders will disagree, but from my time spent in the region, there was not a scene or individual character where I was skeptical of objectivity - from the bus driver to father.There is so much to be said about Savior, and it is a must see for any international audience. It may unearth a conflict of opinions among serbs, croats and bosnians, but perhaps they would be reading too much into it...

His only chance to find it is the last place he intended it to be. Within himself.Savior tells the incredible true story of Joshua Rose (an always brilliant Denis Quade), a man, who after seeing his wife (played by the stunning Nastassija Kinski who unfortunately doesn't have a lot of camera time) and child  brutally murdered by an extremist group, goes on a murderous rampage to avenge their deaths and fill the emptiness that they have created within him. But instead of making the wrong things right and alleviating the emptiness, Joshua too is now an extremist killer who must flee the country and assume a new identity as Guy, a member of the French foreign legion. Here he takes refuge and joins a cause in hopes that he can redeem the wrongs that he has committed. But as the war progresses for this sniper, he just gets deeper in to the darkness. Until, however, he is called in to do a refugee escort mission and meets Verra a beautiful surbian woman who is pregnant with her Muslom rapist's child. After having a scuffle with his partner over the woman and then subsequently murdering him, Joshua, Verra and her infant son embark on a powerful journey of hope and redemption through the war torn plains of Serbia.Remarkable is the only way I can start off my review of this movie. This In my opinion is the most underrated drama of all time. The characters are so beautifully created by the great actors playing the roles that you actually believe these experiences are happening to these people. Quade who I mentioned earlier is an amazing talent who is truly one of hollywoods best shines, like the north star. Next is the ultra talented and little known actress Natasa Ninkovic who turns in a performance so brilliant I would have nominated her for an academy award had I been on the committee. Director Peter Antonijevic creates a movie so powerful that scenes seem to actually come out of the television and literally pull on your emotions. I must admit that I really hope hollywood uses this virtually unknown director much, much more in the future.Writer Robert Orr knows how to put together a movie, his script is first rate and just glows with realism. He also boasts great ideas and shows how brutal war can be. For instance a scene where Quade must sit and watch a bus load of people either get clubbed over the head with a choice blunt weapon from a golf bag or get moad down in firing squad fashion. The journey that he takes the characters on delves so far in to the black, take for instance the scene I recalled earlier wich happens to occur within the first five or ten minutes in which Rose get's the appalling opportunity to see what his family looks like after they've been charred to a crisp by a devastating explosion, that you can't even begin to think that Quade has any chance of finding the good in the world or even in himself for that matter. But through twists of fate and a little compassion Rose start's seeing a chance and so does the viewer.To Finalize this without giving this movie the exact credit that it deserves would be an absoloute sin. This is the most powerful Drama I have ever had the pleasure of viewing, and had it had a couple of more scenes in wich the viewer was able to witness a little more of the war aspect of that torn country I would have given this piece of artistry a perfect ten (and I almost and I stress almost never give out that mark). I would personally like to thank everyone involved in this movie especially co-producer Oliver Stone and the great cinematographers who captured the feel and landscape of the country beautifully, for allowing me the pleasure of enjoying this priceless gem. Now drama's are actually at the bottom of my film category list just due to the fact that they are all seemingly soap opera's that run in the same direction, but to all of those reading, for the drama genre and movies in general this dynamic film truly is a Savior.Overall Rating 9 out of 10 "},{"Title":"Man - I wish I never saw this movie","Date":"23 June 2000","Score":"19 out of 22 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, War","Review":"  I was stumped at the video store - had basically narrowed the DVD search down to 2 - Sphere (yeah, I know..) and Savior, this interesting looking title on the bottom shelf.Thank goodness I chose this one.What a brilliant, gut-wrenching, agonising movie...Other comments have said it was a low budget job, but the DVD version I just saw didn't even make you think about the mechanics of the movie - just the characters and events that this film portrayed.The cinematics - beautiful scenery etc (to show that man really has no sense at all - he can be surrounded by some of the most amazingly beautiful surroundings and still turn the place to hell) and sound (the gunshots / ambient stuff etc were very well done) were all spot on..For the actual plot, the other comments posted are a lot more lucid than mine, so I won't bother trying to explain the premise of this flick.I really don't know what else to say - some of the scenes containing brutality were brilliant (in a really horrible way) - none of the usual hollywood (tm) bad guy finally gets it in the end type stuff - cliche - it really just showed how pointless these kinds of conflicts are. clicheOh man - this film is going to stick with me for quite some time.

The dark odyssey of the soldier (Dennis Quaid) begins in tragedy--the death of his wife and son, whom he has been neglecting because of his military duties) in an alleged Muslim extremist cafe bombing--and leads him on a rocky, suspenseful chase to redemption. On the way he works as an assassin/sniper for the Foreign Legion, and as a mercenary-sniper for the Serbs. He commits cold blooded murder regularly, hard-heartedly, until he shoots a peasant teenage boy. This is his turning point. His conscience seems to reinvent itself. He intervenes in the savage beating of a pregnant woman, delivers her child, and thus begins the redelivery of himself into renewed morality and humanity. An important part of the journey of the baby girl, the mother, and the wounded savior is the effective and affecting portrayals of these characters by Quaid and the (I think Serbian actress) young woman. She has been cast out by her family and is very reluctant to accept the child or Quaid. The story moves along a perilous road with many painfully tense--and unpredictable event (not a cliche in the picture, unless one thinks beautiful babies and weeping rescuers is maudlin--moments and tragic scenes. I don't think this film is well know in the states; what a pity. I don't think Quaid (and many fine European actors) garned awards and recognition for this film, I do think Mr. Quaid created one of the finest characters/performances I have seen in the movies.

But other comments here point out that the baby was his savior as well -- from his own misery and alienation. He and the baby saved each otherThe acting and directing were first-rate. The scenic photography was excellent too, but sometimes the tight budget showed, particularly in the sound quality. Still, the technical quality was generally quite good. The mix of English, subtitled local languages, and untranslated local languages was quite effective -- subtitles were used where they helped tell the story, but left out where the American's non-comprehension was the main point.In spite of the mildly optimistic ending (which I found appropriate), it was a very gloomy movie. But it's such a good movie that you should see it, when you're in the mood for a very sad story.

When I saw it, I simply could not take sides... was it the muslims or the serbs to blame? I guess neither... Yugoslavia was of no use anymore... communism was down in Eastern Europe, there was no need for an western-oriented outpost behind the Iron Curtain... so NATO decided it must be somewhat erased, diminished... I am ashamed to admit that at a certain point during this war, the leaders of my country sold out to NATO like prostitutes and allowed Alliance planes to cross Romanian territory en-route to the conflict zone... OUR NEIGHBOURS.So, the main character should be viewed as a basic person who lost his family and is loosing more and more of his soul as time goes by and he pursues his vengeance... as soon as you attach a Citizenship (American) and a Name (Guy) to his personna he becomes the representative of a nation that has been policing the World for its own dirty purposes for the better part of the 20th century... and then it becomes much harder to root for him... too bad ... Why is it that in every movie, the main characters have to be Americans? There are some moments during this movie that made my heart stop, like the massacre near the bus... such pain, such rage, such unrelenting hatred against the humanity itself...Either way, the film is very powerful and it depicts only a small amount of the atrocities that took place during that war...

I agree without hesitation, but it's important to remember that, particularly in its conclusion, SAVIOR is also both heart-warming and gratifying. I have seen very few films that juxtapose these various qualities so well.This is one of Quaid's finest performances as Joshua Guy Rose, a former U.S. Army officer who joins the Bosnian Serb Army for the simple reason that they are fighting against Moslems, a religion that, for reasons the film reveals, he's come to hate. He soon finds himself the unwitting savior of Vera, a Serbian woman played with utter conviction by Natasa Ninkovic, and her child conceived through rape by former Bosnian captors. The symbolism of the half-Serb, half-Bosnian child shines through very well. Settings are also worthy of note The Bosnian sequences were filmed right next door in Montenegro, and the whole sense-of-place adds as much immediate realism to this film as the superb acting.There are some rather heated debates on IMDb's Discussion Board regarding what SAVIOR supposedly says about the war in Bosnia and how it portrays Serbs, Croats, and Moslems. Obviously, way too much has been read into the fact that the director is Serbian-born. Certain events and portrayals will inevitably upset citizens of the former Yugoslav republics who were victimized during the wars in the 1990s. However, the basic focus of this film is as nonpartisan as it can possibly be. If anything, SAVIOR overdoes the point that Bosnian Serbs, Croats, and Moslems all committed acts of both horrific cruelty and extreme compassion. In the words of one character, I am Croat, my wife, Serb. Before the war, no difference. Now, stupid!

They rush toward it, enduring one conflict after another along the way, losing friends and sometimes the hero himself. In commercial pap, Rambo races towards the goal, is captured and tortured, escapes, and wreaks revenge. And Errol Flynn, no matter the tribulations, will wipe out the Japanese radio station and take the airfield.This movie, about the tribal warfare in the former Yugoslavia between the Serbs, the Croats, and the Muslims, doesn't adhere to the usual conventions. Dennis Quaid, older and lumpier, escapes American justice and finds himself a mercenary for the Serbs while in the French Foreign Legion. The ethnic cleansing that goes on is so general that at times it's hard to keep track of who's expelling or executing whom.One of his assignments is to pick up a Serbian woman who has been held captive by the Muslims and was deliberately made pregnant by them. Her pregnancy is intended as an insult to the Serbs and especially to the woman's family. Quaid's Serbian companion receives the insult exactly as intended. They stop the car in a tunnel and the companion kicks the woman brutally in the stomach, bringing on labor, and is about to shoot and kill both her and her baby before being shot by Quaid.Quaid drives her to her family's humble farm. The father, finding her with a Muslim baby, throws her out. The goal has been achieved. As in a typical action movie, Quaid has escorted his ward and her baby from Point A -- the prisoner exchange bridge -- to Point B -- her home. But the movie isn't nearly over. It's barely begun.Quaid drives her and the baby away, not quite knowing what to do with them, and they're both a big problem for him. The mother -- an entirely ordinary-looking woman -- hates the baby and refuses to breast feed it. She doesn't speak at all. And the baby girl herself isn't the cute kind that is likely to milk sympathy from Quaid even if not from the mother. It's a nuisance. She cries constantly because she's not fed, until Quaid improvises an instrument out of a milk bottle and a condom. She soils her wrap and Quaid curses while he washes the garment in an icy river.I don't think I'll go on with the plot. There's very little gore but an abundance of savagery and murder. And it all takes place on gravel roads, wet streets, and skies the color of dirty wool, whipped by an frigid mid-winter wind. It was mostly shot in Montenegro, near the Albanian border.I was in Albania once -- for about thirty seconds -- but it was summer, the skies were blue and the sun was warm. Nothing looked as dreary and unpromising as this. I was in Yugoslavia too, when it was one nation and Tito was in power. There wasn't this sort of insanity going on because Tito would never have permitted it. All the rules seemed to be observed. When a wedding party and its band marched through the streets of Skopje, nobody stepped off the sidewalk because a police officer would dash over and bang the miscreant's shins with his baton. Yugoslavia was a socialist dictatorship. Yet, watching this, one wonders which political arrangement is better. Maybe Thomas Hobbes was right. In some countries anyway, a strong leader is required to keep the public from each others' throats. Maybe a certain level of political evolution is necessary before ethnic or regional allegiances can be subjugated to those of the nation itself. There is, of course, no guarantee. America had its own Civil War.At any rate, I've never seen such a powerful anti-war statement before, or any movie within the genre that's quite so original in so many ways. There SHOULD be a developing romance between Quaid and the woman he's trying to save -- and there isn't. The woman herself should at least be saved -- but that doesn't happen either.It's a film made for adults and you're likely to forget in a hurry, or at least try to. Anti-war movies are supposed to end with the good guys winning. The audience should never have to leave the theater confused, as they do here and, rarely, in movies like The Bridge on the River Kwai.

The violence, although frighteningly real, exists in the film as both the problem and solution for the main character. Indiscriminate hatred and violent atrocities against all humanity provide the locomotion, propelling this gripping drama to a bitter-sweet ending. There is alway a bias from those who have actually lived the history of these times and they feel it is incumbent on them to point out the factual errors--and perhaps they should. I know a few people from New Orleans who hated the exaggerations and misinformation in the movie The Big Easy. I am not from New Orleans and enjoyed the film. Movies are not documentaries unless they state they are documentaries--and even then you can never be sure of unbiased facts (Michael Moore). Savior may have used the Balkan violence as an environment to place his story about Guy. It could have been Korea, Germany, Iraq and been just as effective.

She was a teenager at the time, and she once told me that no one believed that the war would actually escalate so far, until before they realized it, a battle was being fought in the neighboring town a few miles away. Her parents made a wise decision to drop everything, grab the kids, and head for the border...

The concept of a 'war hero' I consider to be a dangerous pitfall, which many movies of the genre are only too happy to fall into. Probably because it makes the horrors of war slightly more meaningful - and thus bearable - if they are construed as 'obstacles', which the 'hero' must overcome in order to achieve his ultimate aim.In 'Savior', there are only victims.The movie explains this by describing war as a state of society where the ones most likely to survive are those who have let go of all values. Notice how neither Guy nor Vera - the main characters - ever fully manage to reach this state of total cynicism even though they both try. This is why a quest to regain their humanity is sure to end up victimising both of them.In summary, the main achievement of 'Savior' is in making tangible the viewpoint of Thomas Hobbes, who said that war must generally be avoided, because in war, human life is 'brutish, nasty and short'.Natasa Ninkovic deserves praise for her frighteningly believable performance as Vera.

Once free of his commitment to the Legion, he becomes a mercenary in Bosnia, where he continues his vengeance campaign against Muslims.But as Quaid finds out, his allies can be scummier than his foes; this is the setup of Savior, wherein Quaid redeems his humanity to save a helpless baby, yet another victim of the nameless war.One thing that Roger Ebert doesn't mention The guys with the hammers are Croats, not Serbs or Bosniaks (Muslims).

Vera was raped by the Muslims and got pregnant, and Goran, who knew her family and her before the war, does not accept her pregnancy and decides to kill her, kicking her belly. Guy shoots Goran and saves Vera and she immediately delivers a baby girl. Vera does not accept the baby and her family expels Vera and the baby from their home and Guy decides to get them to an UN camp. In their journey, Guy recovers his humanity through the contact with that rejected baby girl. Yesterday I saw this spectacular movie for the third time.

The bitterness, pain, and grief that she communicates wordlessly, the utterly credible movement of the heart as she begins to relinquish it, her heroism in the end, I found so devastating that it would be very hard indeed to find anything comparable in the films of the past few years. (It seems worth adding that she is also incredibly beautiful, one of the most haunted and haunting faces I've ever seen.) The tension between Quaid's character, for whose emergent humanity she feels as an intrusion on her grief, and this ravaged soul who struggles against her own decency, strength, and capacity for hope, are striking for the sparenesss of the way it's enacted, and are sufficiently memorable that even in the midst of the carnage, hate, and cruelty of a war that seems to originate in a collective pathology, the goodness of the these two people are what I will remember from this tragic, beautiful, honest movie.

For me the essential take from this movie was that there is still a place for film to convey a strong message rather than simply to entertain. Personally I found the contents far too shattering to find this film entertaining in the conventional way. It is a pity that this important film seems to have slipped rather effortlessly beneath the water and plunged to a great depth where only movie fans wearing diving suits and oxygen will be able to raise it for the occasional airing. Performances are even and Dennis Quaid manages to put across a man who having  abandoned the human race finds it again amongst the sheer mindless horror of war. It is also appealing to find actors willing to to understate their performance so that the essential message isn't over powered. Saviour is a move that sets out to reveal the blackest side of the human experience and never flinches from the responsibility of taking on such a task.

It resonates much like the Dance of the Wolves. Even though it doesn't have a big budget, it succeeds extremely well in illustrating the Bosnian war, the brutality and the blind hatred, and one man's journey from the death of his loved ones to his redemption at the end. The plot is not very complex, but the story is very complicated. There are many symbolisms and messages that you will need to pay attention to; there is a lot more to the movie than what meets the eyes. Every scene has a special message that you will really need to analyze in order to understand why they are showing you what they are showing you. There are also a lot of conflicts on ideology and ethics in this film. I also thought that Dennis Quaid is superb in this film. He succeeds in brining a subtle emotional depth to a person who is supposedly numbed by his experience with deaths. However, if you just sit there passively, this movie will really try your patience. If I want to make a criticism, it will be the budget. This film was probably (surely...?) made on a limited budget and it showed. Other than that, this is a great film!

I decided to watch it because it was about the war in Bosnia, and I had recently read some books about the breakup of Yugoslavia. The first 20 minutes of the film had me worried that it would descend into some kind of action hero claptrap. Dennis Quaid's character is an American military officer who loses his family to a terrorist attack, commits some atrocities of his own, and becomes a hard, unfeeling mercenary. After a tour with the French Foreign Legion, he finds employment helping the Bosnian Serbs kill Muslims. From this point on the movie really begins to shine. Quaid, who I never before thought of as a heavy hitter among actors, does a great job portraying a man slowly recovering his humanity amidst inhuman madness. The Slavic cast also gives wonderful, believable performances. Especially Nastasa Ninkovic (Vera). This movie has scenes of horror and despair, as well as scenes of compelling poignancy and basic humanity. It's also one of those rare movies that breaks away from the usual Hollywood storytelling stereotypes.I couldn't stop thinking about Savior for days.

There's very little humour (the odd comic line seems misplaced) and, as befits a polemical film, the director hits his message home hard. My only question would be the ending. The redemption of a main character by a chance meeting is too convenient and very American in its attitude. Perhaps the film should have ended differently, but then it might have been too much to cope with for the audience. Recommended to anybody with an interest beyond populist cinema.

Also the supporting characters are at their best. I don't know what the Balkans look like but I guess they should be kind of similar to what is shown in the movie. Even the prop is great.The way it shows the hate relation between Bosnians and Serbians makes you think, wether they actually could live together in one country. The violence they treat each other and the coldness they treat their own people after being in contact with the enemy is also something to think about. Yeah, maybe, at least I think so that the subject the movie is about, how to co-habitate with the people you are told to hate. Besides of not generalizing, specially after 9/11.

He turns his back on the French foreign legion, and makes it his mission to keep the mother and her infant alive.

How can they possibly make it?This is among the best anti-war films, up there with both versions, 1930 and 1979, of All Quiet On The Western Front. It is brutally honest about the numerous atrocities of the conflict, including the fact that both sides took part in them - this does not take sides, nor does it paint anyone as good or evil. The rape of the enemy's women, leading to them getting cut off by their family, the mass executions and the sheer random luck of it all. It uses powerful contrasts, such as life and death. It's no wonder that Oliver Stone produced this, otherwise leaving the work largely to those from the region. This is mostly silent in the middle, and does not subtitle the non-English spoken unless one of the Westerners understands it, making it all the more effectively alienating.

Very overlooked war film that shows war with no filter, no glossy heroics. Just what it is.

After seeing this he turns into a mercenary of sorts and loses all emotion.  Until he comes upon a woman pregnant from a rape.  Quaid feels a bit of compassion and takes her to her home after he is forced to deliver the baby himself.  She is kicked out of her house and Quaid again decides to take her, this time to a refugee camp. It is on this trip that Quaid regains his feelings for life as he begins to bond with the woman and child.  This description might make the film sound like a bit of a feel-good movie.  It's not, their are several disturbing scenes of violence, including against chldren.  Still the film is rewarding as it does give you a glimpse of some of the horrors of the middle-east and allows for you to see a man change.  I have always liked Dennis Quaid and here he gives what might be his best performance.  He is good, but not great as the emotionless mercenary, but once he meets the woman and baby, his performance becomes superb as the character changes.  I read a couple of early Oscar reports that had his name mentioned for this movie.  Although he didn't receive a nomination he probably deserved one, though not the Oscar itself (nothing could beat Edward Norton in American History X).  Highly recommended.

First of all, it's an excellent war movie, tough as reality can be, without all the stuff and all the magnificent heroes usually shown by Hollywood movies (We were soldiers, etc.). But, after the movie was finished, I had to watch it again because the story sounded strange... The movie deals with the war in ex-Yougoslavia and illustrates all aspects of it. Serbs, Bosniacs, Croats have victims whatever their belief and their culture, suffering from the madness of war... and the slow progression of the main character, trapped in an insane 'will to kill', from hate to humanity, is truly moving. But, apart the fact some elements are merely commercial (the beginning with N.Kinski, the US nationality of the main character) made to attract US watchers, the movie has a main drawback  the balance is not fair.- Excepted the old man married to a Serb, the only Croats depicted in the movie are barbarians committing a mass murder (the climax of the movie). - Bosniacs, as Muslims, are the ones who initiate the war process in the movie (bomb attack in Paris) and are shown killing civilian Serbs (mass murder in a village) - Serbs are also acting vs Bosniacs but never a serb is directly shown as a killer  the old woman is, factually, killed by the helo bombing ; the muslim child on the bridge is killed bu a US wardog. Above all, the acts of violence committed by Serbs stem from an honor code (most of time Serb versus a Serb) or are partly justified because the victim is not a real innocent (the raped muslim girl is the daughter of an exploiting man ; the Muslims killed in Paris during the prayer had weapons, etc.). there is a Serb bad guy but he looks like a ordinary student turned mad by war, aimed at protecting his land...So Savior is an excellent movie about the redemption of a man who, because he was inspired only by hate was out of humanity but perfectly adapted to a world without humanity. It's moving that the most he becomes a man, the most he suffers... But Savior is not the movie that surveys the war in ex-Yougoslavia.

What's more cynical then moral equalization between victim & executioner, how tries to whitewash narrative of war & crime itself, while rewriting history using apologia & ambiguities. I will admit, though, O.Stone made a good decision when he sent his script to Belgrade based director. Story goes, he noticed him for his eye & photography earlier. Indeed, film is visually beautiful & moody - that's about all that is good about it.At the beginning of this propaganda film viewers are immediately introduced to common Islamophobic trope, so prevalent in todays discourse it paint adherents of Islam with a one broad brush, regardless of their race, ethnicity & cultural background - basically, Muslim here is absolutely identical person to Muslim everywhere. Because of Islam, you see. Islam is supposedly so inherently evil, so corrupt, that it turns persons into clones of each other, into some sort of zombies. So, without any background elaboration, viewer is lead to accept that main character logic isn't flawed, although his action upon that logic might be wrong, when he connect act of terrorism and people from the other side of the planet who committed it to people in Kosovo and Bosnia, only because both people happened to be Muslims, so he decides to take revenge on Kosovars and Bosnians. Of course, viewer will react with rejection of his actions, but only because it's a revenge, and revenge is bad, while much, much lesser number will reject it because this logic is actually very flawed, this connection between terrorists and Bosnians is bogus - film & its author won't allow it anyway, you see, that's deliberate framing of both Muslims everywhere & Bosnians & Kosovars on screen Bosnians are equally evil if not worse then those terrorists them self. From here underlying moral equalization gets worse with every frame.Some noticed how others complained of possible (certain) pro-Serbian bias, they ask why, & don't get it. Others try to explain how authors meant ant-war-this & ant-vendetta-that. As one reviewer writes even if it carries pro-Serbian bias, as long as we see one Serb is sadist, all is OK. He writes Inevitably, some have accused Saviour of bias, though an American film, the director is a Serb...; with such emotive subject partiality would hardly be surprising. Indeed, the film does not flinch from discussing atrocities committed by Bosnian Muslims. Those who accuse this film of being pro-Serb, however, should consider that one of the most hateful characters in the whole film,...is himself a Serb. Another writes I am surprised & saddened that there are still some folks here at the forum fighting over its anti/pro Muslim/Serbian credentials. There is no winner in any war - only despair & death & at times, a faint glimmer of hope. Reading through comments you will hardly be able to draw that conclusion about how people perceived it. Actually, most (re)viewers thinks exactly what I said before everyone are equally bad & responsible. And that's what this film makes a propaganda. One reviewer said you don't hate Serbs, Croatians or Bosnians, you hate war. Of course, we all hate war, & little by little, we think everyone is equally responsible for its beginning, all suffered equally, & civilians on both sides were stricken equally by its horrors - all of a sudden it must be everyone are equally bad & responsible!

After Quaid's character shoots an unarmed Muslim child who is trying to fetch a goat on the wrong side of a bridge, one starts to wonder if this movie is trying to show the Serbian point of view without criticizing it. There is a weak explanation for murder of the child, but again the overly violent and completely unnecessary act is not redeemed in anyway.The Serbs and Muslims agree to a prisoner exchange. For over thirteen Mujahideen Muslims (which were not likely to be in Bosnia anyway, although it did happen), the Serbs trade one pregnant woman who they immediately try to kill because she was raped-of course, by a Muslim.Even the Serbs are treated unfairly in this film. If you accept Oliver Stone's story and setting you might believe that not one house in all of Bosnia has ever had electricity. It's bad enough that they all have a collection of various goats and sheep.Regardless of the genocidal tendencies, the plot seems to be made up as the movie drags along.
