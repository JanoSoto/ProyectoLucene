They're not dolls in this movie, but rather five special puppets, crafted with love to be the companions of an old, lonely man. Jester, the quiet puppet, and last to be created, who sits back and watches is by far the most interesting. It's cool to watch his head spin around (it's made up of three distinct sections) when he changes his facial expressions.These puppets have been lost for nearly fifty years when the story begins, and a bunch of psychics come to investigate the hotel. The death scenes in this movie are unique -- no one can commit gruesome murder quite like tiny little people. But even though they're rampaging the hotel, these toys aren't evil. They set a standard followed in Puppet Master II (a movie that, while tolerable, is no where near as good as the original) in that the puppets have no choice but to follow their master, who will eventually reap what he sows.It's a fabulous movie, from the scenery of the old bed and breakfast at the Bodega Bay house, to the almost sweet-looking puppets (who just happen to like to murder people), and all told, I think I would have to give this movie an eight out of ten. Sure, there's simulated sex, but it's not all that bad. The movie itself is pretty tame -- there's language, humor, gratuitous (and fairly strange) sex, and violence, but it's not marked by extreme gore (well, there's a questionable part right at the very end that is a little disgusting).One of the best reasons for watching this movie is the cast, particularly Paul LeMat as Alex Whitaker. He's excellent as the peace-keeper in the movie, as well as the first of the psychics to have a really good clue what is going on in the household. Unfortunately, even he, in the end, jumps to the wrong conclusion.Viewers who enjoy this movie will enjoy Child's Play, Dolls, Demonic Toys, and Dolly Dearest, among other horror films. Although Puppet Master isn't quite as demonic as the others mentioned, and has no aspects of Satan-worship, voodoo, or demonic culture, it's still another of those inanimate objects come to life movies. A definite hit!

Good. My brother picked this movie up for me on DVD, because he knows of my love of horror movies. My first thoughts as I inserted the disc was that it'd be a cheesy, laughable pile of 80's horror rubbish. So I was in for a pleasant surprise. If you can get past the initial presentation of the movie (it feels every bit as low-budget as it is), you'll find it to be creepy, intriguing, and above all, great fun. The puppets themselves could have been a whole lot worse. The effects are hardly Lord Of The Rings, but through a strange combination of live-action and extremely well-animated stop-motion, the puppets don't make you cringe every time they show up on screen. They're probably better actors than some of the live actors even, it's difficult to tell who's more wooden. But it's hardly a character-driven story. It's an unusual story nontheless, and it definitely interested me enough to watch it right through - and then pick up the first sequel!If you ever saw the movie Child's Play, with which comparisons are inevitable, you'll know already whether you can suspend your disbelief enough to enjoy a movie about killer puppets.

Puppet Master was the first and arguably the best example of Full Moon's 90s style, a style that included a heavy use of puppetry and stop-motion animation that showed the progression of an idea that he started in his 1987' production Dolls (directed by Stuart Gordon).During World War II, a secret group of Nazis were sent to Bodega Bay, California, to capture puppet maker Andre Toulon (William Hickey), a mysterious old man who had the secret of giving life to inanimate objects. He commits suicide before being caught and so his secret goes with him to the grave. Until nearly 50 years later, a group of psychics lead by Alex Whitaker (Paul Le Mat) are contacted by Neil Gallagher (Jimmie F. Skaggs), a former colleague who apparently made a big discovery in Bodega Bay before committing suicide under mysterious circumstances.Directed by the tragically underrated David Schmoeller, Puppet Master is a very different films that its sequels. Schmoeller plays with the suspense and atmosphere of classic goth films, and successfully mixes those elements with the more graphic shock and gore that was the rule for horror films of its time. With a great eye for the visuals Schmoeller makes great use of his Gothic locations and the terrific camera-work enhances the carefully crafted suspense. The special effects wizards create very good looking effects for the budget and together create what could be called a gothic slasher.Schmoeller gives life to Band's story and this mix of fantasy and horror ends up as one of the best screenplays developed at Full Moon. Each puppet has a personality of its own and that is what gives the movie life; the human characters are also very well-defined and for the most part well-acted. Despite the silly premise of a killer toy (already explored in Child's Play and Dolls), Scmoeller and Band make the work and craft set-pieces of haunting atmospheres. Richard Band's eerie score perfectly showcase the mix of horror and fantasy of the film and it's probably his most famous work. It quickly became the trademark of the series.As written above, the acting is for the most part good for a movie like this, and while no one really stands out, they all make an efficient job. Paul Le Mat is quite good as the lead character, although the rest of the team soon prove to be more interesting characters. Despite his limited screen time, William Hickey makes a small but charming job as Toulon, and look out for a Barbara Crampton small cameo. As a side-note, it was refreshing to watch a movie where the main characters are middle-aged adults instead of young teenagers.The movie's main problem (and one that marked the series since its conception) is that the puppets quickly became the focus of everything. This lessen the importance not only of the final villain, but also of the heroes of the movie. While this problem didn't affect that much this movie, it became more notorious as the series started to grow and eventually, the puppets would become the main characters of the movies.Puppet Master may not be everyone's cup of tea, as its premise and the mix of fantasy with horror may turn off some movie goers. However, it is a quality film that proves the talents of both Band and Schmoeller, in a film that has become a cult-classic. 8/10 "},{"Title":"Entertaining, old fashioned piece of feel-good horror!","Date":"29 December 2005","Score":"9 out of 11 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" Puppet Master is a wonderful, good-hearted slice of old-fashioned horror nonsense from the imagination of Charles Band.

None of these are as good as this first outing, although part 2 deserves note for it's flamethrower toting Torch puppet. When I initially saw Puppet Master I was fairly new to the Horror genre and thought it was fantastic. Three years on and with the benefit of hindsight and perspective, Puppet Master is okay, but isn't going to set your world alight.So long as you don't lose sight of the fact that this is Straight-To-Video trash in it's purest form, you'll never have any trouble fully enjoying what Puppet Master has to offer. The bad acting, cheesy music and noisy splatter effects are all part and parcel of what you should expect from American B-Movie horror, but there's a great charm and knowing sense of fun about the movie lacking from a lot of movies with more money thrown at them.Most of this is the result of the painstaking work put into bringing the puppets to life. The puppets are a mix of animatronics, pure animation and some improvised techniques, and as a result have a life all of their own, making them far more watchable than the cast. Although Irene Miracle and Paul LeMat put in fairly decent turns, the rest of the cast are shocking (and not in the good way you normally associate with horror) and hopefully people you've never seen in anything else, meaning you will spend the movie rooting for the puppets.All in all, for a movie so utterly riddled with problems, Puppet Master is still a fun ride. I certainly have no qualms recommending it for a quick rental or a rainy day, but I'll warn you one last time, it is cheesy, gory and trashy so it won't be for everyone.

The film was a huge hit on video shelves & also allowed FULL MOON the chance (for a few brief years in the 90's at least) to expand into the reigning king of successful & recognizable B movie film companies on the thriving direct to video market & allowed the company to get not only bigger budgets for future projects, but begin to sell soundtrack tapes in major chain outlets, T-Shirts, posters, comics, cards & more...Some have called PUPPET MASTER a CHILD'S PLAY rip-off however I disagree with this statement. FULL MOON founder CHARLES BAND had been making mini killer doll & monster movies long before that film. PUPPET MASTER was just another film in his mini diminutive killer cannon. It's certainly understandable as to why fans would think the film was merely trying to cash on CHILD'S PLAY success, since the film emerged onto video store shelves a year after that films release date & although PUPPET MASTER isn't as good as that film (arguably) it still has many moments to help elevate it to be just as worthy & because of it's attempts to scare audiences, it remains thus far the flag ship of FULL MOON. The stop motion effects by the late great David Allen are very well done. PUPPET MASTER also gives hot blooded horror fans what they want, namely a few nice bloody kills, creepy puppet POV shots, suspense, tension, atmosphere & nudity & many creepy moments, such as a headless puppet looking for it's head, crawling out of a coffin & another effective scene where it is tossed down the stairs by it's intended victim, who escapes in an elevator, only to find it waiting for her on the floor she has selected to land on. The puppets themselves are a creepy bunch. RICHARD BANDS Carnivaleque horror movie theme, gives the film a really creepy edge to it. Another thing I liked about PUPPET MASTER besides director David Schmoeller's excellent direction, is it's fresh story, rather than a simple recycled CHILD'S PLAY'S plot & that's why I think in large part, the film has continued to thrive as long as it has. The puppets themselves are also presented in a different light. Unlike a lot of killer dolls, these puppets are not evil, but only do the will of the maker who has given them life, be he/she good or evil. Director Schmoeller also cleverly plays on a few mind twists, you're not really sure if some of the scenes in the film are real, or a dream at times. Unlike the latter sequels, PUPPET MASTER is a pure horror film, it's a mercilessly effective horror item that works on it's own intended level, it's a very scary horror film, unlike the latter sequels & to be truthful that's all that really matters in the long run. The puppets really don't serve the plot much at all, but their presence is certainly felt throughout the films running time. Their merely a window dressing for the films actual plot, which in itself is a very interesting. Using the puppets sparingly allows the film-makers to create a sense of dread throughout the films running time.The characters on the other hand are a rather bland bunch. Their so bland in fact that the puppets actually give better performances! Only PAUL LeMAT as a Yale University teacher, stands out as the only psychic that doesn't appear to have sex on his mind because the other three psychics (& in a flashback Gallager) are obsessed with it. Heck even the puppets are revealed to have a sleazy side to them, as they peek through a key hole, as a couple has sex!. The pacing also tends to drag on in a lot of area's. The back story on Toulon is also disappointing, we never do learn how he came upon the secrets of eternal life, nor why the Nazi's wanted with him (this would be later answered in th sequels) & another problem I had was with Gallagher's explanation for dispatching the puppets, to murder his friends & why he killed himself, which is to live forever, but when he finally does get killed, he dies just like a normal human being would if being murdered, he feels pain & bleeds (though a green liquid instead of blood) so how would this serum make him immortal if he can be killed like a normal human being?

Puppet Master is one of those films, that if you're a horror fan, you hear ripples about all the time. I'd read about it on the Internet and heard about it in countless other places, but had never got round to seeing it. I really wish it had stayed that way, because this is without a doubt one of the worst films I've ever seen.Now let me first say, that I'm not a film snob, I enjoy dumb fun as much as the next horror fan. Some of my favourite films include things like Friday the 13th and I recently saw a film called Monster Man, a very low budget horror-comedy which although terrible, tickled me in the right places. Carrying on from there, Puppet Master is still an extremely bad film, even from a trashy, gore fiend's point of view.Now I'm not going to even bother complaining about the acting in the film, because lets be honest, no one sitting down to watch a film about a group of murdering puppets expects great acting. The acting was believable, lets leave it at that, it's the most you can hope for.The direction however was one of the worst things about this film. There are a lot of overly long, drawn out sequences in this film and it's not until about 45 minutes in, halfway through the film, that anything happens. The worst example has to be the opening sequence where Toulin (the Puppet Master) is collected up all his puppets and hiding them away, as someone is after him. As we see him do this, it is inter-cut with two men in black making there way to him and at the same time, one of his stray puppets trying to do the same thing. This went on for about 10-12 minutes, it was just the two guys walking and a point of view shot from the puppet running around trying to get back to his master. About 2/3 into this sequence I was shouting at the television, as I was so bored and frustrated that the film wasn't progressing. Another example is the scene at the end, where the puppets turn on their new master and attack him in an elevator. It went on forever! It was not scary or particularly violent and quite simply bored the ass off me!There are also a lot of ideas and concepts within the film, which might have sounded good on paper, but do not work at all in the film. The first thing that springs to mind is the female puppet Leech Woman, the whole thing of her regurgitating leeches which suck her victims dry, is both utterly unconvincing and totally retarded. For a start, the effects used for this scene are abysmal! You can clearly see that it's just either a real leech, or a fake, being forced through the back of a rubber head and out the mouth. I mean, come on, the rubber puppets head even distorts and bends as the puppeteer struggles to force the leech through the mouth. Another is Pinhead (Hellraiser already took that one morons), it is never once explained why on earth a puppet has a pair of what are clearly human hands. It looks ridiculous and the fact that we have no idea why he doesn't just have puppet hands makes it seem all the more ridiculous!All in all, Puppet Master is an awful film and I cannot begin to imagine why it has such a cult following. The vastly superior Child's Play had already covered this ground the previous year anyway, so I guess the keyword here, is POINTLESS. It is badly directed, the acting is average and the effects show the age of the film like nothing I've ever seen before.When I borrowed this film from a friend, I also borrowed the sequel Puppet Master II, I somehow don't think I'll be bothering!

Then there are the Full Moon films that stick with you despite their faults. The Puppetmaster belongs to the third group. To this day, this film has held a place for me where so many have fallen to the wayside. It's one of those few in its genre that has a lasting effect. The script is banal and FARRRRR from spectacular, and yet I can remember most every line of it even though I haven't seen it in six months. The special effects are indeed B-budget, but even so they capture my imagination in ways that some CGI movies today couldn't hope to; the puppets involve me rather than detach me. The theme, performed by Band's brother Richard, cannot be repelled from my mind, while many Big-budget show-tunes escape me only days after I hear them. There's something about this low-budget film that really grabs you. So is not to say that this film is without any flaws. In fact, it's rife with them. On the surface, there are many technical goofs in the film (the scene in the elevator, with Tunneler's arm rods being vaguely visible, is an example.)More internally, the script is weak in one major respect its characters. None of the film's characters feel very real; each feels more like a caricature, made to cater to a certain stereotype or mold. For example,we don't learn much about the character of Dana Hadley, played by Irene Miracle,other than that she's an alcoholic witch. The same can be said about the characters of Frank Forrester and Carissa Stamford; we are led to believe that they are both brilliant minds and lovers, yet all we see are a couple of sex-crazed numb-skulls. The protagonist, Alex Whitaker, played by Paul Le Mat, is one of only two characters that doesn't quite ply into a stereotype. Instead, he's sort of an uninvolved character, who doesn't say much to reveal anything about his personality.And thus, he's sort of a weak protagonist. This is Puppetmaster's biggest problem while the film has the air of mystery and spookiness, the scares aren't as strong because we don't care too much about the characters. The motives of these characters are fairly well-clarified, they're just missing something emotion. I don't recall a single human emotion, other than fear or distaste, being shown to me. And the characters lack that third dimension because of it. If the movie had characters that you could like and feel for on top of its other elements, it would be better twofold because the scares would be more potent. The flaws in character don't mean that Puppetmaster is a bad film. In fact, I very much enjoy this film as well as the series as a whole, and I would recommend at least giving it a try, especially if you're a horror fan. After all, it's only 83 minutes long, and moves quickly. As for me, I'm actually in the process of finalizing my own script for a remake of The Puppetmaster, if only for my own satisfaction in doing so. A remake where you enjoy the puppet master atmosphere, that mystery it has about it, but also feel for the characters, scaring you even more when they are offed. I think that's what any knowledgeable fan would want.

I remember watching this when I was a kid and now I just re-watched it after having bought a collection of the films (as well as the Killjoy trilogy, which I have yet to see) and I got the same excitement as I did as a kid.It is scary in certain ways, some scenes at least. It's more of a movie your going to watch in awe because it's so much fun to watch. As a kid I was terrified and as an adult I was in awe.Watch it for a good fun night!

Over the past thirty years or so, he has made a name for himself and his film companies by making some of the most memorable cult flicks. And his work ranges from horror and sci-fi to fantasy and even children's movies. Amazingly enough, he must have inherited those marvelous traits from his father Albert Band, who made the wonderfully creepy I BURY THE LIVING. Even his brother, Richard, has inherited some of those traits. In particular, he's provided nifty music for many of Charle's films. Anyway, when talking about Charles Band, you'd have to include the PUPPETMASTER series, the DEMONIC TOYS series, the PREHYSERIA series, as well as the incredible adult BEAUTY AND THE BEAST retelling called MERIDIAN. And that's just to name a few. At this moment on IMDb, under PRODUCER credits, he has a total of 244 films under his belt. If that's not a monumental achievement, I don't know what is! Now the review. Back in the 1940s in a hotel, a brilliant puppet master named Toulon learned how to bring his creations to life. However, when Nazis come to seize his discoveries, Toulon kills himself. Flash forward about fifty years and now a team of psychics come to the old hotel. What they discover is grisly as one by one, the aforementioned puppets come back to life and start claiming lives. The stop-motion puppet effects are seamless and lifelike. Each individual puppet is so unique. Some sport hooks and one even has a drill on the top of its head. Though I find the plot meandering, it holds your attention. From this modest little production would spawn ten movies to date, including PUPPET MASTER VS DEMONIC TOYS. Clearly Mr. Band is taking a cue from Universal Studios, having two successful movie monsters battle it out. Not to mention the numerous Godzilla and Gamera movies. Acting is pretty good, though a couple performances are a little wooden. No matter, the real stars are the puppets and special effects. So I advise you to sit back and enjoy, with or without popcorn and/or beer!

I worked nights so didn't have much of a social life. Because I didn't have access to the great IMDb, I had to go by the VHS/DVD (I still have both machines haha) box art and cover descriptions. As a result of this blind movie renting, I got to see a lot of what turned out to be some really REALLY crappy horror films. As the numbers of these bad films I'd seen went up, I finally began to realize my biggest disappointment always occurred with FULL MOON productions. After seeing maybe 6 or 8 FM abortions, I stopped renting them. No matter what the box art or synopses told me, if I saw it was produced by FM, it was back on the shelf with blinding speed. Because of this, I managed to not watch PUPPETMASTER until just today. Odd that this one was the only FM film I actually enjoyed - to a point.I said I enjoyed it to a point. Yes. It was well directed and for the most part well-acted except where the people and the puppets were interacting. I'll tell you, if I saw a foot-tall puppet (even without with hooks and knives where its hands should be) walking across a floor towards me, I'd be *FREAKING* not just breathing a little hard. So, yeah, acting was a bit weak at times when it should have been more convincing.I must say, for a fairly low-budget effort, the puppet stop-motion effects were astounding and even the obvious optical compositing (usually the weakest part of a cheaply-made film) were done quite well. I liked the location. That large hotel/mansion or whatever it was had a lot of character in and of itself but I feel as if it was underused. I liked the fact that the cast were all adults and not a gaggle of barely-legal teens recruited from a first year college acting class. I also enjoyed the music/score a lot even if it was a shameless rip-off of HELLBOUND - HELLRAISER II (at least the opening and closing credits).The story itself seemed to lack a serious sense of forward momentum... kind of wandering from one set piece to another with no real feeling of urgency especially in the last 20 minutes or so when things should have been pretty hysterical.In spite of my seemingly negative comments about this movie, I did actually like it. At least I was able to watch it all the way to the end without FFW or just plain giving up as I did with many of the other FM films I've rented. For a horror movie, it was fair. For a FM production, it was fantastic and for that reason alone, I find myself able to recommend it.57/100.

Haunting music from Richard Band, sometimes stilted but always watchable acting from the leads with a great cameo from Barbara Crampton at the funfair too. The story is straightforward this time (later films in the series are more jumbled) with Nazi officers coming to get the secret of life from Andre Toulon when it all goes wrong and the puppets are forced to look after themselves.

It's a film you thought more would come of it, but it did become a popular cult item that managed to spawn numerous sequels. The film has a crisp, polished look and a creatively charming collection of puppets by David Allen, but for a story that bases itself on the whole mystery angle it's too skimpy and does too little by stringing along one set-piece after another to show off some unpleasant and outlandish deaths. We're left with too many avenues which are brought up, and never expanded on clearly enough. Although the sequels would go on to do so. Director David Schmoeller's able craftsmanship rightfully lets the dolls leave an impression, and in doing so effectively projects the suspenseful attack scenes with full-blooded shocks. Some sequences and imagery are eerie and sinisterly warped, and there's an odd kinky tone in the plot, but the slow pace doesn't help. It didn't need to be lightening fast, but some tighter handling would've worked well amongst the vivid Gothic atmosphere that the grand creaky seaside hotel bestows. Leading the way and probably most memorable thing about this feature is Richard Brands' boundless, titillating music score that playfully sets-up the strange, dreamy air that smothers the foundation. The dolls work in stop motion animation, stunt puppets, and rod puppet designs that surprisingly come off very well. Performances are fairly interesting and lift up material, with some recognizable names in Paul LeMat, William Hickey and Irene Miracle who illustrates a fun bitchy turn. Also Barbara Crampton appears in a delightful cameo.

I'm not kidding, this film has a sex scene, puppets (yes this movie features puppets) killing unsuspecting people and gruesome deaths, that involve actual blood. Directed by David Schmoeller, whom is more of a hero here, and written by Charles Band and Kenneth J. Hall, a masterpiece was born on that one fell year of 1989.Starring Paul Le Mat as Alex Whitaker, whom is the soul survivor, and William Hickey as the puppet master Andre Toulon, the movie starts off well with a long scene of a puppet, one known as Blade, running through the hotel called Bodega Bay Inn trying to reach his master before two Nazi thugs do. Sadly, the puppet master is reduced to a gun that shoots a hole in his head that kills him instantly. The Nazi's wanted his secret to how he made his puppets live.The film shoots forward some years (the film started in 1933) and brings together four physics that helped this one man named Neil Gallagher (Jimmie F. Skaggs) find the old puppet masters secret stash of secret puppet juice. Dana Hadley (Irene Miracle), or the white witch, Frank Forrester (Matt Roe) and Carrisa Stamford (Kathryn O'Reilly) go to the hotel where sadly all are eliminated.A character known as Theresa (Mews Small) is the first to die. She is bludgered to death in front of the fireplace (of which Dana the white witch told her to stay away from) by Pinhead (voiced by Ed Cook). To be true, she really needed to go. She had this creepy girly voice that creeps up your spine.The second and third to die is Carrisa and Frank. Carrisa was in the process of a sexual contact with Frank. Blade (vioced by Bert Rosario), the leader of the puppets, sends in Leech Woman (voiced by Linda Cook) and Tunneler (voiced by Tim Dornberg) to finish the lovers. Tunneler drills his head into Carrisa and Leech Woman vomits live (yes live) leeches onto Frank's body.Dana is the last, well really she isn't but I'll say she's the only good person to die, to die. Lets just say that Pinhead breaks her leg, punches her in the face and before he can finish her off she tosses him over her shoulder to the first level. Blade then comes in and chases her to the elevator that takes her to an awaiting Pinhead. He gets in two punches then is thrown to the side. Blade jumps in and slashes her throat, and Jester (voiced by Michael Laide) twirls his head in excitement.The ending comes to soon, Neil Gallagher shows his undead self and starts fighting Alex. His wife Megan (Robin Frates) tries to intervene and is thrown away. The puppets (after witnessing Neil throwing one of them to the floor) attack their master and kill him. Blade cuts his fingers and then pushes his knife blade into Neil's hand and holds Neil's mouth open for Leech Woman to vomit a huge leech into Neil's mouth. Pinhead is pressing Neil's temples hard while Tunneler drills his head into Neil's neck, thusly breaking his neck.Special effects were done perfectly by Mark Rappaport and Patrick Simmons, and the music score was done nicely by Richard Band. Visual effects perfectly made by Dave Allen, Paul Gentry and Justin Kohn. The screenplay was written by David Schmoeller.Watch this through four, you'll wish for more afterwards but trust me don't try anymore than four. Five is good, but not as good as the rest.

One by one, the visitors are killed by a collection of creepy supernatural puppets, that were created 50 years earlier by André Toulon, the puppet master, who held the power to give life to inanimate objects.Nasty killer dolls are hardly a new idea in horror, but with the diminutive characters in Puppet Master sporting such attributes as a drill-bit head, over-sized hands, and the ability to spit leeches, this film definitely had the potential to be a little different. Unfortunately, thanks to a rather dreary slow-moving plot, some terrible acting, and minimal gore, the film doesn't realise its full potential.Although the puppets themselves are beautifully designed, with each definitely being imbued with its own distinctive character, the manner in which they move, however, is less well executed much of the film is seen from the dolls' point of view, with the camera swerving around furniture and between peoples legs, which is a little cheesy (and it's hard to believe that they are never spotted); some of the puppetry is rather awkward (too often, it is easy to picture a hand out of shot, manipulating the doll); and the stop motion that makes some of the more difficult moves possible is hardly brilliant.Paul Le Mat, as the film's hero Alex, is uncharismatic (and he sports a seriously dodgy hairstyle), whilst the other psychics are pretty unlikeable, making it hard to feel sorry for them when they are bumped off by the tiny killer marionettes.The first in a series of Puppet Master films from producer Charles Band, this film isn't really deserving of the cult status it appears to have and only leaves room for improvement.

I still remember how the VHS cover art gave me major chills just to look at! It was the coolest most scariest thing, right there on the shelf of Rent-A-Tape, the puppets in their crate just dripping with menace and the promise of grisly puppet death, and for me this was always one horror movie that actually lived up to its awesome box art. The tiny terrors are definitely an iconic and lovably horrid bunch. Blade is the slick little death assassin and is probably everyone's favourite, the teeny-headed bald guy with the strangling human-sized hands is the muscle, Leech Woman is the doll-sized deadly temptress, good lord, how could I have never clicked-on as a kid as to what the symbolism of her nauseating trick actually means!? I find the Jester interesting. He may not kill anyone, but he's the only one that can really display emotions. While it's very artistic and beautiful to watch, I fail to see how his expression changing is physically possible, unless of course it's a part of the magic process that gave him life in the first place.. And the Driller is the one I find the spookiest because what he does is downright mortifying and messed-up! And while they may be creepy as all hell, I like the rule that the puppets aren't actually evil, they just do evil things if commanded to do so by the Puppet Master... I dearly love the excellent music which is very memorable and really does add a ton of depth to this movie all by itself and gives it a completely unique feel. Eerie atmosphere and tone is where it really does come out on top, and a lot of the unnerving quality of it is the classic kind of things.. What's hiding under the bed, what's scuttling around in the shadows that you only just miss as it rushes by.. It builds up the suspense and tension really well. But that said the plot is irritatingly hazy, convoluted and barely makes sense, and it gets boring and surreal at points. The focus is mainly on the people and not so much the puppets, and it does feel more like a mystery than a horror. Yet for me, overall it still works. It's hard to follow what's going on for a lot of it, especially if you don't pay attention during the opening sequence. So there was the real villain, the Puppet Master, who when he was alive was a greedy rapist asshole who wanted to live forever so he married some girl just for the money and worked together with a group of psychics of various kinds to help him find the hidden lore of the late Andrei Toulon and he got what he wanted, and then he lures the psychics to the foreboding Bodega Bay Inn by their dreams to have his new puppet servants slaughter them one by one so that no one will ever know his secret. It's just very sloppy and confused storytelling, I think they should have dropped the psychic nonsense as a flick about killer puppets is bound to be pretty weird however you go about it. However, it's really gotta be the highlight of the whole thing and is mighty gratifying when the grimacing villain eventually ticks off the puppets when he hurts one of their own by contemptuously throwing it across the room - which then for him spells disaster, as the puppets turn on the master! Oh you know he was in for it after harming poor Jester, never mind that four people are already dead because of the guy! The madness reaches such a magnificent crescendo in that scene, I love it, it's so gruesome! And then there's more vague oddness at the ending which sees the dull as dishwater woman staying at the inn as its new owner, and judging by her dog she's figured out a few tricks. They never say what happened to the puppets, which is annoying, and then it ends on a weak note, but I still find it a very worthwhile movie. Most of the actors like the Beethoven- looking fella with the huge head are just boring, the only one I liked was the sassy fortune teller who foresees her own death, she was the only one to me that seemed to be trying to have a little fun with it. I think the best thing about it is the special effects, the puppets, both model and stop-motion animated look really good and hold up surprisingly well, I hadn't seen this for several years until recently and I think they still look impressive, you can feel it when they're attacking somebody. I love how much individual detail and scariness is put into each one. I do hope they never remake it, because there'd only be like ten thousand CGI puppets, they'd all be ten feet tall, and Marvel superheroes would appear to defeat them. So while it may not be essential viewing to everyone, I consider this movie and its sequel to be real distinctive gems of the horror genre and they're both really close to my heart! There's a certain charm there that always makes me love it, flaws and all. It isn't trying to be anything else than what it is, which as far as I'm concerned is pure, unadulteratedly entertaining schlocky horror magic. So let's hear it! Three groans for Puppet Master!!!

Currently there are nine films in this campy and purposeless franchise. The first of these low budget films was released in 1989 to minimal success. Although it does have enough of a cult following to spawn so many sequels, this is one cult that hasn't brainwashed me into following. The movie starts at the Bodega Bay Inn in 1939. An old puppet maker who has the ability to bring his creations to life is being hunted down by two guys in sunglasses and trench coats. After hiding the dolls in the walls (hey that rhymes) he kills himself. There is this long puppet POV sequence of him going through the hotel and for some bizarre reason nobody seems to notice him. This is really the least of the movies many, many flaws. Ancient Egyptian spells, witchcraft and telepathy fill in the so-called plot. It seems to go for more of the campy B movie horror then for real terror and suspense. The puppets themselves each have there own distinct look and personalities, which is probably the films only good point. The animation of the puppets is also very strong. The human actors should have followed the puppets lead. The film looks very 80's in the clothes and hair styles, but good character development and story is never out of date.

The story concerns a puppet master named Toulon who has found the ability to give inanimate objects life through some Egyptian parchment bury his life puppets in the wall of a hotel. Years(at least 30) later a group of psychics and other magicians arrive at the same hotel to attend the funeral of one of their kind. Death is the reason they are there and the future that awaits most of them as the puppets inexplicably(at first) reek havoc on them. We get an interesting assortment of puppets a tunneler that has a head like a drill that drills the face off of a truly lovely woman(Kathryn O'Reilly). A female doll that grunts and coughs up leech-like creatures. A maniacal puppet with a hook and a blade for hands. And a strong-arm puppet complete with giant hands and a small head(Pinhead). The deaths are fairly graphic and there are a few suspenseful moments. The plot isn't much, but the acting is acceptable with Paul Le Mat and Irene Miracle as two of the magicians doing rather well. O'Reilly bears her soul literally and what a soul she has to bare = bear I mean. There is also a nice little performance by Merrya Small as a maid. Director/writer David Schmoeller does a pretty decent job given the budget he has to work with and the expectations that come with a direct-to-video film like this. Puppetmaster has some exciting moments, some horrific scenes, some inane situations, a dreary, predictable plot, and a stuffed dog - why I still don't know. It also has some very innovative scenes and special effects given its budget, and hey William Hickey is there briefly and rather lethargically too. I haven't seen its sequels but the first one deserves a viewing.

She's Ms. Leech, and the major delight of Puppet Master I is watching her and her other pint- sized companions, Blade, Pinhead, Jester and Tunneler do their stuff. We meet them in the Bodega Bay Inn when a small band of psychics arrive to learn why they seem to be getting strange mind messages from a former colleague, a man named Neil Gallagher. But it turns out Gallagher is dead...we see him in his casket. We also see him sitting in a chair and waltzing wearing white mask. We see him at the head of the table when his friends gather for dinner. Could it be that Gallagher discovered the secret formula an old puppet master named Andre Toulon used to bring life to his puppets? Hmmm. All we know for sure is that 50 years ago, at this very same Bodega Bay Inn, Toulon hid his puppets in a secret compartment, then fired a bullet into his mouth as Nazi agents burst in his room. And now, in 1989, in the dead of night and in this deserted Inn, Blade, Pinhead, Jester, Tunneler and Ms. Leech seek out the visiting psychics and the Inn's lone maid to slash, smash, strangle, burrow and regurgitate them to death. Only Alex Whitacre and Megan Gallagher, Neil's wife, will survive that night. They find themselves at that same dining table, this time with the bodies of their friends slumped in chairs...and with a live Neil Gallagher maniacally announcing his hideous plot to bring life, not just to puppets, but to corpses. But what's not to love about murderous little dolls? If a cult film requires a silly but amusing plot, home-spun acting that brings smiles, a stuffed pekinese that shows a lot of talent and death charging at you at ankle level, then Puppet Master is one of the best of the cult films. Among my favorite characters were Irene Miracle as Dana Hadley, a whiskey-swigging voluptuous psychic; Jimmie F. Skaggs as Neil Gallagher, a thin, prancing actor with a face like one of his puppets; Ms. Leech, of course; and Tunneler.

This was not so bad because this movie had cool puppet that each had their own powers and ways to kill a person or thing. Like Blade-he has a blade that can cut deep to kill his victims. Leech Woman-she throws up leeches and puts it on human-body and sucks their blood. Tunneler-has a driller attached to his head and drills into a person and kills them. Pinhead-has a buffed body and tiny head,has a great grip. And Jester-a jester that turn three pieces of his head when a person dies, helps some of his team-mates. And this movie was not so good because the kills weren't so bloody and didn't make so much sense because that is not the first Puppet Master series,it was the three one.So I give this movie one and a half thumbs up, but not bad of Charles Band's creation.

A group of colleagues, all with some sort of psychic powers of their own, try to track down secrets that the puppet maker left behind with the mindset of harnessing the ancient power of raising the dead.The Good Okay, so for starters, this is pretty cool concept for a movie. There is a lot of good back-story with the character of Andre Toulon (which has far too little screen time), the puppet maker with a gift of breathing life in his puppets... which he just happens to make look kinda creepy... and with weapons for hands and heads and stuff? Uh, okay... I guess so. Anyway, the fact that there is a lot of mysticism and psychic power type of stuff going on all over the place is enough to keep your attention. I actually wanted to know what was happening and how it was all going to unfold. For a cheesy puppet-kills-people movie, the story was intriguing enough to keep my attention until the end. There's a little bit of a who-dunnit type mystery aspect to this movie and I guess I wasn't expecting that. It was a nice touch to the script, which isn't awful.The Bad The acting is a bit over-the-top and not in a good way. I wouldn't call it bad, just not great and it's distracting from the characters, because they are somewhat interesting... even if it is only from the standpoint that you want to know what their secret power is and how it relates to the overall story. Also, the puppets themselves almost become secondary to the story and at times, the writers almost forget about them... which is a bit odd. Are they good? Are they evil? It's almost like the writers couldn't figure it out. Maybe they are neither, I don't know. It was like, Okay, I guess this is supposed to be a horror movie, so let's throw in a scene where one of the puppets does something nasty. They really seem to want to tell two stories, but don't blend them well enough to tell them both simultaneously, so it focuses more on the humans and what they are after - which is the ability, not the puppets, so the puppets become a side show instead of a centerpiece. The puppets themselves are not scary and the movie isn't overly gory, but they are kind of cool and unique to an extent, I guess.The Blind? Are all the people in this movie blind? It's funny how no one can actually SEE the puppets running around. There are far too many scenes shot from the view of the puppet (running around on the ground, etc) and no one sees them. It wouldn't be so distracting if they didn't take a hey, look at the cool camera trick we are doing to make it look like you are the puppet running around every five minutes. It takes some of the believability out of the movie (and yes, I know that's an oxymoron). "},{"Title":"This film is one of my guilty pleasures. It is by no means an puppet masterpiece, but it entertains me for some odd reason.","Date":"8 June 2013","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" It's mindless fun written by Charles Robert Band, the Founder of Full Moon Features, an company known for its direct-to-video B-List horror & sci-fi movies. Full Moon's first franchise was Puppet Master inspired from an earlier Empire film, Dolls, and United Artists' success with Child's Play the year prior. Directed by David Schmoeller, the first movie start off in 1939 at a hotel at Bodega Bay, CA where the puppet master himself, Andre Toulon (William Hickey) who commit suicide to escape being captured by Nazi spies for his knowledge of reanimation dead people and putting their souls into his puppets. Bodega Bay will be used for the settings for a lot of the Puppet Master movies. The actor that play Andre will most likely be remember to most people as Uncle Lewis from 1989's National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. Anyways cut to 1989, where a bunch of psychics are invited by a former colleague, Neil Gallagher. (Jimmie Skaggs) who they believe has been sending them visions of the future. Only to find that Neil Gallagher shot himself and they have come upon his funeral. If they were really psychics, how on earth did they not see that Neil killed himself? They must have not been the best of their trade. The first 40 minutes dragged on without any puppets on screen. Finally all of the psychics are attacked or killed by the puppets that remain at the hotel. Only two of them will find the connection between Andre Toulon's puppets and what happen to Neil Gallagher. Without giving away too much of the mess of a plot, the film is a bit confusing and made absolutely no sense. I watch it, a number of times, and it still doesn't. It didn't explain enough in the film, to the point, I have to guess just to fill in the blanks on the plot holes. Metaphysically speaking Neil killed himself. Okay that really tells us a lot about why there's puppets running around the hotel killing people. What did the new puppet master had against his own friends and quickly turn against his puppets? How was he able to bring himself back from the dead, when he was dead? Wouldn't it make sense if his wife use the formula to bring him back? What ever happen to his wife in the end of the film? Anyways it's never answer, and the whole heavy use of psychic power was never explain in the other films. The other thing, good about the plot was that they at less, gave the victim characters a little bit depth. Plus, the puppets seem to have more free will than the film lets on and can quickly turn sides unlike other movie monsters. They can play both the villains and the heroes. The movie got a cult following so the puppets were turn the good guys in most of the subsequent films, fighting various enemies including Nazis and inter-dimensional alien puppets. One of the treats of the movies is when new puppets are introduced, although it's always kind of sketchy as to how they come into existence considering Toulon is dead in most of them. The best thing about this movie are the puppets. Each of them having an interesting way of killing people. Blade looks like a small version of the Fisherman from 1997's I Know What You Did Last Summer with a hook. Pinhead is a Conehead lookalike muscle man mixed with Addams Family Uncle Fester who punch and strangles people. Tunneler has a drill on his head, that drills into people. Last is Ms. Leech who is a Leech-puking doll is originally terrifying. Also there is Jester who pretty much just there to be there. He's pretty useless. Overall Puppet Master was enjoyable, but I never bought the struggle between man and puppets. Too much rolling around. Chucky from 1988's Child's Play was certainly the superior murder toy. The puppets themselves are magnificent though, but I just wouldn't see how people in this film can't overpower them. Their stop motion movement was always fantastic and creepy. Lending the film a unique eerie presence that couldn't be accomplished with CGI and this is coming from someone who thinks people are too hard on CGI. Would've been nice to see some elaboration on the sequels considering there are so many of them, but this was nice none the less. I was left scratching my head for about 90% of the movie and the other 10% of the time, I was freaked out by the puppets I do like the music. It fits the mood indeed. The movie is full of 1980's and 1990's stupid horror clichés. Following the age-old formula of people wandering off alone and getting killed one by one, stupid scenes of nudity, and pointless scenes that make no sense. It's watchable, but give up your hopes for a serious horror movie here. It's not that. So check it out if you want to.

Said team falls prey to Toulon's five killer puppets. Writer/director David Schmoeller relates the entertaining story at a steady pace, creates and maintains an effectively eerie and enigmatic atmosphere, makes good use of the sprawling mansion location, and stages the grisly murder set pieces with real aplomb. The sound acting from a capable cast helps a lot Paul Le Mat as the easygoing Alex Whitaker, Irene Miracle as flaky and bitchy fortune teller Dana Hadley, Robin Frates as the sweet and charming Megan Gallagher, Matt Roe as amorous researcher Frank Forrester, Kathryn O'Reilly as Frank's horny and sultry partner Carlissa Stamford, and Mews Small as loyal servant Theresa. Late, great character actor Jimmie F. Skaggs almost steals the whole show with his marvelously creepy portrayal of evil and cunning villain Neil Gallagher. Barbara Crampton has a funny bit as a gullible ditz at a carnival. Moreover, the puppets are splendidly grotesque and colorful, with the oddly alluring Leech Woman arguably rating as the spookiest of the deadly bunch. In a refreshing break from the tired teen horror norm, for once it's adults in jeopardy instead of the usual teens in peril. Making two of the psychics kinky sex freaks is a nice and inspired touch, too. Sergio Salvati's polished cinematography boasts plenty of smooth gliding ground level Steadicam tracking shots. Richard Band's shivery score hits the shuddery spot. David Allen's funky stop-motion animation likewise does the nifty trick. A fun fright flick.

Basically Andre Toulon (William Hickey) was a puppet master who had Nazis threatening to steal his Secret of Life, so he shot himself in the head at Bodega Bay Inn. It is there, fifty years later, that psychics Alex Whitaker (Paul Le Mat), Dana Hadley (Irene Miracle), Carlissa Stamford (Kathryn O'Reilly) and Frank Forrester (Matt Roe) have come to see former colleague Neil Gallagher (Jimmie F.

As time goes by, strange things start happening in the inn, and not just sensing past events, but with some puppet toys coming out to kill the psychics one by one. These toys, Blade (voiced by Bert Rosario), Pinhead (voiced by Ed Cook), Leech Woman (voiced by Linda O. Cook), Tunneler (voiced by Tim Dornberg) and Jester (voiced by Michael Laide) all belonged to Toulon, and have been awakened by something. Eventually, Alex and Megan are the only two left alive, and they discover that Neil is not only still alive, but used the Puppet Master's secret to get the puppets to do his will. In the end though, the puppets are out for themselves and kill Neil in the elevator, before disappearing, and Alex and Megan get out safe and sound. Also starring Merrya/Mews Small. The gore amount isn't as much as I would have expected, the puppets are a little tame but amusingly brought to life to kill, I think this is more for the fans than me, a silly horror. Adequate!

But it certainly did make for an interesting series of films starring killer puppets.  A film made only for cult film horror fans with a specific taste. When viewed upon in that light, only then can one see the real appeal to this film.  Or just weirdos with a fetish for toys.Without giving away the meat and potatoes of the movie, here's a short summary of the film.The picture starts out in California 1939.  In a very rich looking hotel an old man (William Hickey in a cameo, I mention his name because I can't remember any of the other actors in this film.) is seen painting the face of one of his puppets along with other wooden creatures that he created.  When gazing out his hotel window he notices two men with trenchcoats and fedoras.  The Jester he's painting spins his head in a fearful disjointed look.  The man, identified as Andre Toulon, comforts his creations and hides them in his now infamous trunk. He hides them in a secret passage in the wall and just as the men (nazis) knock on his door, Toulon puts a gun in his mouth and pulls the trigger.  We cut to the present (1989) where a group of psychics come to the now empty and abandoned hotel in order to solve a former colleages death.  Where are true stars of the film await them.If you're wondering why the last sentence of that paragraph is so brief.  It's because the opening is the most dramatic part of the movie. The characters in the film are quite cliiched as far as psychics go. There's the slightly normal but tortured one, the slutty one, the eccentric one, the slimy ladies man, the shy innocent one.  Actually they seem just like any other cult movie cliche.  But older and more sophisticated looking. As one might have guessed, Toulon's friends are there to cause more than a little puppet-related-psychic-deaths.True to cult movie fashion, guess who the real stars of the movie are. The actors read through out there lines with real genuine boredom.  The script actually has some pretty good twists put in it.  Especially near the end.  While the puppets are very emotional and entertaing.  The actual puppet work is done to such good effect as to give the little wooden creatures almost genuine emotion.  I find it quite ironic (if you will pardon the pun) that of all the characters the actual actors are the only ones giving wooden performances.  Which gives the film accididental protagonists and a quirky sense of humor.   Which Band must have tuned into at the end of the film.In conclusion.  This film is predictable at times.  The acting is hollow and emotionless, even during the sex scene.  But the actual puppets play there little hearts out.  So for the cult film lunatics with doll fetish's.  This is a good start to what became a quite marketable franchise.

Also, the recently deceased homeowner might not quite be dead.Here's another film from my childhood that comes back to haunt me as an adult. Expecting this to be one of Full Moon's better films, I watched it and found myself immensely bored, at one point almost falling asleep. Paul LeMat (Golden Globe winner) was an interesting character with interesting hair, but his acting was horrible. And Barbara Crampton shows up, but not nearly long enough (she has a cameo as a carnival attendant).The first hour of this film drags, focusing way too much on back story and characters that are not important and are not interesting. The next fifteen minutes is a bit better. The final ten minutes is decent, but does not redeem the extreme boredom of the beginning. And to think there's like eight or nine sequels to this picture! You know, I like Charles Band (the producer) and I think Ken Hall (the writer) is a great guy, but wow... this film was not half as good as I recalled it being. The number one reason the puppets get the least screen time. Should I blame director David Schmoeller, whose previous work, Crawlspace, puts this film to shame?Blade needs more screen time, and some of them -- Jester, for example -- seem to have no purpose being in the movie at all. Leech Woman was pretty good and rather disgusting, although I wonder how often her power is actually useful. Tunneler was cool, Pinhead was cool... but again... I needed a lot more of them on the screen. The humans were just not worth caring about. Sure, there's an interesting sex scene... but that isn't character development.No Strings Attached featurette is seven minutes, with very brief interviews with David Schmoeller, Paul LeMat, Charles Band and puppet genius David Allen and his crew. It is not particularly revealing, though at seven minutes I guess one cannot expect much. Charlie Band's 5-minute introduction is actually more informative, and you can never get enough of him saying dude. Also, as of 2010, the film is now available restored and remastered -- though it does nothing to make the story better.This film might best be left unwatched for those who want to keep the mystique of Puppet Master alive. Not that the film is awful, but it is not the amazing legend many have made it out to be. Richard Band's cheesy score does not help. A remake would do wonders for this film, as long as they kept within the boundaries of the Full Moon feel. A bit tighter writing, but with comparable special effects, and this would have been a timeless film. Now it is just another memory of mine destroyed and spread throughout the countryside.

Most people will at least get some entertainment out of it whether its fear or laughter. There were minimal effects but the scenes were shot pretty well and you don't really think about it. I think at some point I will add this movie to my collection b/c of its originality. Thats really all she has to offer. If you like fairly cheesy horror flicks go out and rent this movie.

I came to the film relatively late in life- reading other IMDb entries people often talk about it as the stuff of nostalgia, something they caught as a kid or teenager, and that worried me- I didn't grow up on these films, how would I find them as an adult viewing for the first time? Truthfully it's a lot of fun. It's an intriguing little set up, where some interesting characters find themselves in a grand hotel with killer puppets on the loose. Whether it's deliberate, or the side effect of a low budget, we do get a lot of character development and some exploration of the different manifestations of psychic ability in the lead characters. Some nice moments of snappy dialogue too- special mention has to go to Irene Miracle as Dana, who has some wonderfully cutting one liners.The inevitable twists are silly and hammy, but you get the sense that this is all done with a self deprecating sense of humour. While it's far from slapstick, there is a camp sense of humour in this film- after all it IS about killer puppets! The movie is certainly worth a rent- but be in the right frame of mind for it. I wouldn't say it was a party film, it's a quiet little film that isn't afraid to take its time building up the situation and characters, so perhaps more for a quiet night in and a change of pace from modern, loud, ultra slick cinema.I have to mention the stop-motion effects used to animate the puppets. I found this to be really effective, rather than dated as other reviewers have mentioned. I find in these days of CGI, it was a real treat to watch, and did have a certain realism you find missing in computer animation today.I luckily managed to get hold of this much discussed Puppet Master 1- 7 Box Set from Full Moon- even more surprising as I live in the UK! I'm actually really curious to see where this series goes over the next few chapters. All in all though a very encouraging start!

Puppet Master has to be one of the best straight to home video horror movies of all time. I even think the sequels are some of the best straight to home video movies of all time(except for Retro-Puppet Master, cuz that sucked bad and I haven't seen Puppet Master 4 & 5). Even though Retro-Puppet Master should be burned, I still think the Puppet-Master Franchise is one of the best franchises of all time. I think in part of the reason why Puppet Master was such a good movie, was because it wasn't scary. It was good entertainment to watch mindless victims fall prey to these pint-size demon dolls. I highly recommend this movie to anyone. Personally I think it's better to watch this movie on a day when it's real rainy, therefore you know you wont step outside the house. You people know you hate the rain!!! But yeah watch it during the winter times or on weekends because those or the best days where you can sit, watch this movie and experience the great fun that is Puppet Master.

Now we gotta start shooting this damn thing! DO something, DO SOMETHING!! So they hand some poor lad a typewriter and tell him to make something up double time. And the poor lad has to make it all up as they go along.

I bought the entire set from Blockbuster a few years ago, and somehow they got put into my basement. So, I just recently found them and watched them all. And I must say that PUPPET MASTER is one of the better horror films that I have ever seen.A bunch of the sequels are pretty good also, but I like this one the most. The next best film in this series is PUPPET MASTER II. The puppets are classic horror villains. The evil puppets are some of the most ingenious killers to ever hit the screen. I even have a little doll of the Blade puppet. If you want a decent horror film with some half-way decent acting and plot, see PUPPET MASTER. This is one of the better horror films.

It's the series that really got them off and running and put Full Moon on the horror map.  Now they're a permanent fixture as a studio dedicated to making genre pictures.  Puppet Master will always be their trademark film though.  Part intelligently shot thriller/part standard slasher flick, our story centers around a puppeteer, Andre Toulon, who holds the secrets of eternal life and a group of psychics who are assembled to find these secrets.  Several aspects make this an enjoyable B-movie and really set it apart from your average fair.  The first is the score.  It's one of my favorite from Richard Band, a haunting, carnival-esque sound that really drives the film.  The setting, Bodega Bay Inn, is superb for a horror flick and the camera work is brilliant.  I love when the camera view is in the eye of the puppets.  It's fun and appropriate.  A few familiar faces never hurts either.  Some of these faces include William Hickey, Paul Le Mat, Jimmie F. Skaggs (Ghost Town), and Barbara Crampton (Re-Animator).  The fifth aspect are the puppets themselves.  Blade, Jester, Pinhead, Tunneler, and Leech Woman are all incredible and each have their own identity.  They've all become very familiar to horror fans.  Puppet Master would go on to spawn many copycat films and Full Moon themselves would try to recreate this tale of killer dolls on several occasions (countless sequels, Demonic Toys, Ragdoll, Blooddolls, etc.). Note for genre buffs  The film takes place in the same locale as Hitchcock's The Birds, Bodega Bay, California.  Also, the film Dolls, also produced by Charles Band, is seen as almost a prequel to the Puppet Master saga.

To say this movie far surpasses Child's Play is just absurd.  No way does it even come close to the suspense and chills Child's Play delivered.  Puppet Master is the First film to come out of Full Moon Entertainment.  It does have so good elements that will eventually make it a classic cult horror film.  The Puppets look great, the story is slow and too drawn out, the effects are okay, and the acting could be a lot worse.  Charles Band did a very good job with this film...Too bad he got much much worse after his departure from Paramount.The ending is rather complicated, only because the second doesn't really explain too much of what happened.  It seemed there was something we were supposed to pick up on, but we were never given the oppurtunity.  Still a decent horror film that is Out of Print, and hard to find except on Ebay.  the DVD set has been recalled, and no more on on sale. Check this movie out if you haven't...Don't expect too much and you will be pleased with this low budget horror flick.6 out of 10 "},{"Title":"Good for a laugh!!!","Date":"29 July 2001","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" Well what can you say?

Granted this version is cut for cable and commercials(argh!!), but most of the film is from what I remember.Four psychics, including Paul Le Mat from Strange Invaders, come to a manor on a cliff near a shore where Andre Toulon, a famed puppet maker, was living and subsequently died. They also attend the funeral of a colleague(Jimmie F Skaggs)after an apparent suicide. One by one, they are being murdered by an array of creepy puppets, many of them equipped with various weaponry such as the one puppet with a drill that bores a hole in a woman's face, one female puppet likes to spit out blood-sucking leeches, one has not only a knife blade on one arm, but a hook on the other. The funniest puppet has this massive torso and hands, but very tiny head, not to mention a court jester puppet whose face spins three ways.The film is merely an excuse for people to be massacred by puppets with a little plot that deals with possible life after death..something Neil Gallagherthe colleague who killed himself)was studying from the late Andre Toulon's notes.The cast tries to rise above a very mediocre screenplay which is meant to simply obliterate people in various ways with minimal development given to the characters who perish. Some unique killings from the wooden psychos is pretty much the reason to see it.Though, I really do need to see the film without interruption from commercials or people's censoring.   <div class=yn id=ynd_1507226>  <form method=get    action=/register/login  > Was the above review useful to you?   <input class=click linkasbutton-secondary type=submit   name=ynb_1507226_yes value=Yes    rel=login   > <input class=click linkasbutton-secondary type=submit  name=ynb_1507226_no value=No   rel=login   >  </form>  </div>  <hr noshade=1 size=1 width=50% align=center>  <div> <small>0 out of 2 people found the following review useful</small> <a href=/user/ur22556039/><img class=avatar src=http//ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2OTU5MTM0Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTE3ODU2OQ@@._V1._SX40_SY40_SS40_.jpg height=$avatar.image.size width=$avatar.image.size></a> <h2>Skip a few..</h2> <img width=102 height=12 alt=5/10 src=http//i.media-imdb.com/images/showtimes/50.gif> Author <a href=/user/ur22556039/>Jennifer</a> <small>from Sweden</small> <small>31 August 2011</small>  "},{"Title":"Skip a few..","Date":"31 August 2011","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":""},{"Title":"Puppet Master Rocks!","Date":"20 February 2005","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":""},{"Title":"* * out of 4.","Date":"31 May 2002","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":""},{"Title":"EXCELLENT WATCH!!","Date":"27 December 1999","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":""},{"Title":" THESE WERE VERY BAD PUPPETS!!","Date":"23 May 2004","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":""},{"Title":"Spawned the Best Series of Horror Movies!!!","Date":"19 January 2002","Score":"3 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":""},{"Title":"Surprisingly classy and enjoyable little horror film.","Date":"9 November 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":""}{"Title":"And So the Series Begins....","Date":"9 October 2011","Score":"1 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" Puppetmaster (1989) ** (out of 4) A group of psychics gather at the former house of a puppet maker (William Hickey) who killed himself back in 1939. In the present day, the psychics try to figure out some of the mysteries inside the house but they're soon attacked by his puppets who are alive and well. Charles Band and his Full Moon Pictures released quite a few movies straight to video back in the day and I think it's safe to say that this here is one of the few that managed to gather some mainstream attention. The film would eventually set forth a ton of sequels and even a few rip-offs but watching the movie I was a left a little curious as to why. There's no doubt that there's some minor appeal to this thing but for the life of me I didn't see anything overly special that would make me think that we needed a ton of sequels. I think the best thing the film has going for it is the low-budget because this manages to help build up a nice atmosphere that runs throughout the film. I thought director David Schmoeller did a nice job at building up this atmosphere that at least made you feel as if you were in some sort of fantasy land where these puppets could actually be alive. With that said, that's about the only positive thing to say about the picture. One of the biggest problems is that the so-called mystery is so poorly done that you're bored within the first ten-minutes and it's nearly impossible to build up any excitement in regards to what's going on. Another problem with the screenplay is that it really doesn't develop any of the main characters and in the end you have a very hard time caring for any of them and you really don't care if any of them live or not. I thought the special effects were fairly decent considering how low the budget must have been but there are a few moments where the puppets just seem to be much bigger than they actually are. There's one scene with a puppet whose head is ultra-small has its small hands around the neck of a woman and for some reason the hands are big enough to fit around her large neck. This scene doesn't work because it's obvious the hands belong to someone else but the biggest issue I had with all of the puppets was the fact that they simply weren't scary. The R-rated film offers up some brief sex scenes, some nudity and some blood but nothing overly memorable. The performances are decent at best but it's always nice to see Hickey but sadly he isn't around for long. "}]
