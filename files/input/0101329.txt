This is one of very few sequels that really deserve the title of the original classics. Fievel Goes West may not have as many touching moments as the original, but that's because it's more of a fast-paced western comedy rather than a heartwarming, sometimes tragic tale (tail?) as An American Tail was. A by-product of the comedic approach is the look of the movie. Instead of the dark, dull, forbidding color scheme of the first movie, the sequel is supposed to be bright, funny, and altogether welcoming. Thus, you get bright sunshine (sometimes a bit too bright from the characters' point of view) and varied color. The animation hasn't changed all too much, unlike The Land Before Time's sequels for video. The animation retains a bit of Don Bluth's touch, though still a bit different. Altogether, the animation is just about as good as it could be in 1991. The film as a whole is a gem, but the one thing truly, wonderfully beautiful thing about Fievel Goes West is James Horner's immortal soundtrack. The songs are just as good as An American Tail, which is saying a lot; besides, you have a brutally edited reprise of Somewhere Out There from the first film, sung by Tanya. Speaking of Tanya, she's voiced by someone different, presumably to allow for her great singing. For proof, all you need to do is listen to Dreams To Dream. Great though the aspiring singer is, the end credits rendition of the song by the crazy Lindstradt lady is beautiful.In Fievel Goes West, our title protagonist is lost on the way to Green River, where he will supposedly find a new lease on life with his family and lots of other hopeful mice. But the dream is shattered when Fievel explores the train, and finds a bunch of cats and a huge spider, led by the smooth talking Cat R. Waul, plotting to befriend the mice before turning them into mouse-burgers by means of a mysterious better mousetrap! But Fievel is found out, and the spider knocks him off the train, leaving him hopelessly lost in the desert. I thought they might have made up something different, not the whole mouse-gets-lost-must-return-to-family routine. I couldn't help feeling they'd done that before. However, Dom DeLuise returns for a bigger part alongside the legendary canine sheriff Wylie Burp.So, overall, what of this sequel? Well, it certainly does the original justice. Yes, it does lack the heart of the original, but having less heart than An American Tail does in no way mean being heartless. Don Bluth might not have had a hand in this, but Fievel Goes West lives up to Bluth's classic story of a little mouse called Fievel.Animation-9/10; Story-7/10; Plot-7/10; Comedy-8.5/10 = Overall-8/10  "},{"Title":"A charming little film...","Date":"25 September 2001","Score":"6 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Family","Review":"  I'm not necessarily one to grab a bowl of popcorn, dim the lights, and plop onto the couch and throw in, say, Snow White.

The lovable Fievel returns once more as his family journeys across the Great old USA in search of a better life in the west. Unfortunately, the nefarious Cat R.

Don Bluth was replaced by Simon Wells, in his directorial debut. As someone who finds Simon Wells' films to be enjoyable but not top notch (especially in the writing department), this is exactly what we get here.Many people will complain that there are very few plot similarities to the original, this is true, the film's plot is nothing like the original, which I thought was a good thing in my opinion.The characters I found to be much more memorable compared to the original, including the villain, played by John Cleese. Dom DeLuise returns as tiger and is much more funny and less annoying than in the original. Feivel the mouse continues to have a lack of a real character but I still thought he was an improvement to the original, possibly because of his maturing voice actor.The film does not contain nearly the same dark elements as the original, but in my opinion, is more funnier and more fun. The songs are either catchy or not at all, the films signature song 'Dreams to Dream', is as good or possibly better as the original's 'Somewhere out there'. The score by James Horner is a treat, just like the original.All real complaints come from the writing, there are small plot holes, a pointless subplot revolving around Feival's sister Tanya, and sometimes the plot seems a little too convenient.Kids will probably like the film, fans of the original may or may not, I personally rate it lower than the original, but by not too much.

I still own both of them on video and still watch them from time to time. In most ways, this sequel is worse than the original. The brief story of Feivel being separated and lost from his family again is really underplayed in comparison to the first one, which revolved purely around this plot. In Feivel Goes West it's almost as though the family are a bit blas√© about losing their only son. It's also hard to top the musical score of the first one. There is a repeat singing of Somewhere Out There that is rudely cut short but without the whole song, it doesn't have the same warming effect. The feature song of this film, Dreams to Dream is very beautiful, however it and the other songs of FGW can't match up to those of AAT.Despite these flaws, there is quite a lot more to enjoy in this film. If you're a fan of westerns as I am, you will enjoy an animated take on the theme, particularly the very enjoyably cartoonist showdown at the end. Secondly, the voice cast of FGW is far superior to that of AAT. Not content with Dom DeLuise as the loveable cat Tiger, they add to that cast for the sequel the likes of John Cleese, Amy Irving, Jon Lovitz and none other than the great James Stewart himself playing the sheriff of a one-horse western town. They're all impeccably cast and pull off a wonderful job.All this said and done, is the sequel better or worse? I have to say I think it's completely equal. Still the same level of childish fun and heartwarming moments, wonderful voice talents and great musical score.

However the dark edge of the movie was a bit too much for me and I felt as a children's tale it was probably a bit too scary.Don Bluth returned in '91 to film the sequel to his last hit, this one a satire of the westerns. Fievel the mischievous mouse returns as his parents are shipping off to Green River to escape the cats, led by Cat R. Wall (voiced by John Cleese).Along the way a spider (voiced by Jon Lovitz) tries to kill Fievel and he falls off the train, into the desert, where he pines for his feline friend from the first film (voiced by Dom DeLuise).Eventually Fievel finds his way out of the desert and finds a dog-sheriff (voiced by Jimmy Stewart) who decides to help train him so that he can fight off Cat R. Wall, who has moved out west to spread his reign of terror.I enjoy this movie more than the first one because it's not as dark (something I just have a problem with in a kid's movie). The satire isn't as strong and the whole WWII edge is lost but it still retains the cats vs. mice, which is a nice element.The animation in my opinion is more classical and the musical sequences are more lively. The voice talents are far more impressive and I love Jimmy Stewart and John Cleese in this movie - talk about great casting! Overall this is better than the original and it surprises me that more people don't actually know about it. As a nice little family adventure film it's pretty entertaining and in terms of animation it represents everything Don Bluth is known for.

It is dark yes, but it is very poignant and heart warming as well. I never fail to tear up during the song Somewhere Out There, marvel at the beautiful animation or while the story is admittedly slow it is a beautiful and engrossing one. This sequel is a perfect example of a sequel that is worth watching. In most ways it isn't quite as good as the original, though there are one or two improvements along the way too. It has its flaws, but it is better than the dreadful Secret of NIMH 2Timmy To The Rescue and the mediocre-but-watchable All Dogs Go To Heaven 2. Also it is one of the better animated sequels out there, and considering how disappointing some of them have been that is saying a lot.My only real problems with the film are that the plot is a little too episodic, and that the film is too short, if anything it could've done with being 5-10 minutes longer. These aside, I liked the fact the story is cheerier and more fast paced. The animation is not that bad at all, it is colourful and well drawn on the whole, and the editing was above decent. Also the musical numbers are very good here. No, not as good as the ones in the original, and even if they did that is an extremely hard task to come by considering how stunning the music in the original was. Dreams to Dream says it all, that song alone pretty much equals the greatness of Somewhere Out There. The Girl I Left Behind is another standout I just loved how upbeat it was. And I would also like to remark that I thought the singing was better here than it was in the original. One of the minor flaws I had with the first film was that I did not like Phillip Glasser's singing voice, I just found it whiny and out of tune. Back to the sequel, Cathy Cavadini does a great job both voicing and singing Tanya, and Linda Ronstadt completely blew me away with her rendition of Dreams to Dream.What made the movie though was the voice acting. There was some truly inspired casting, and all involved did wonderfully. Phillip Glasser is still sweet and likable as Fieval, and Dom DeLuise is absolutely hilarious as Tiger and I loved it that Tiger has more to do here. There is one part when he falls into the sea and he comes eye to eye with a fish, and he says rather flatly Dogfish. John Cleese clearly relishes his role as the villain Cat R. Waul, a villain I preferred over Warren T.Rat, he could be sinister yet funny as well. But the biggest surprise was Jimmy Stewart as Wylie Burp, Stewart was a great actor, evident in films like Vertigo, It's a Wonderful Life and Rear Window, all classics in my opinion, and he proves once more how talented he was voicing a smaller but wholly relevant character and making the most of witty and sardonic lines. Overall, while not quite as good as the beautiful original, it is a sequel worth watching and was much better than I thought it would be. 8/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"Cleese, Stewart, DeLuise, all good...","Date":"20 September 2003","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Family","Review":"  As far as animated movies go, this is one I enjoyed.

Some people thought it was an improvement over the first film, but I wonder why? Sure, the original was sentimental and predictable, but it had the classic song Somewhere Out There written by James Horner, and also a much better, straight-forward story. The second movie seems more of a Saturday-morning cartoon style western comedy. There's very little story or heart. I guess more people prefer the light-heartedness of this movie than the sentimentality of the first. Now I won't knock this movie for some who like it, but I wish the first film was more appreciated by people. See this only for James Stewart's voice.

The best thing about the movie is without a doubt the villain played by John Cleese because it,s well John Cleese anything he's in is going to be a ton of fun. He is a fantastic comedian and actor. John Cleese turned down the role as Cogsworth in Beauty and the Beast to play this role. John Cleese as Cogsworth would have been amazing. But he is great in this movie, and it would not have been half as good without him. Amy Irving is also in the film playing a saloon singer and and her voice fits perfectly. James Stewart is also on hand in his last role as an old sheriff. But even though he is good in the role, his part is relatively small. I could take or leave the cat Tiger played by Dom DeLuise(Robin Hood Men in Tights ,The Twelve Chairs )His character never did much for me and the subplot with the Indians felt unnecessary.The animation is very good as I said before bringing the old west perfectly to life while also having some good slapstick.All in all a very good family film that both you and your children should see,well made and fun. Also although I have not seen the Swedish dubbing, I'm sure it's very good because it is written and directed by the Queen of animated dubs Doreen Denning who has done many of the best Swedish dubs of animated movies ever.

This sequel movie though, while not as emotional, was so much more entertaining for me. It was fun to watch. The movie starts out in the Bronx, the Mousekewitz family find that conditions are not as ideal as they had hoped, as they are still struggling with life. They always being attacks by cats. After one such attack, the Mousekewitz family decide to try their luck out west. While on the west-bound train, Fievel (Phillip Glasser) wanders into the livestock cart to find out a gang of cats lead by Cat R. Waul (John Cleese) is planning something evil for them. Cat R. Waul is a devious but ingenious feline criminal. He pretended to be the champion of a brave new world where cats and mice would co-exist while secretly plotting to use them as slave labor. Then finally killed them off after they outlived their usefulness to him in building a town in the Old West call Green River. After being discovered, Fievel is thrown from the train by Cat R. Waul's hench spider, T.R. Chula (Jon Lovitz), landing the mouse in the middle of the desert. On the way to Green River, he meets up with old friend Tiger the Cat (Don DeLuise) and somebody that might him on the way, Sheriff Wylie Burp (James Stewart). This movie would mark the last movie for James Stewart, and somewhat a tribute to him for such Western roles as the How the West was won, and The Man who shot Liberty Valance. I like all the western tribute in the film, from having The Searcher's Monument Valley type background to naming one of their new characters Miss Kitty as a Gunsmoke show reference. Still, the mocking of Native American with the Indian mice is just ridiculous stupid and wrong. Now the three of them must become western law men, and try to rescue the town mice before it's too late. Surprising, not a lot of people know this, but Don Bluth was not involved in this film as Spielberg and him had a falling out on the direction of the film. Still it's nice to see it is possible to make a sequel to a Don Bluth movie without completely screwing the original over. I have extremely fond memories of this movie from my childhood, but growing up, I notice some faults. I think some moments in the movie are too fast paced like the animators didn't really always see ahead of how it would look like. Like when Tiger hides in the sign, he jumps down and lands on the ground a second after the dog disappears, which is insane. The animation isn't that great, but it's better than most sequel animations. Don't get me started on the other American Tails films after this. The colors are bright. The special effects are nice, the train action was intense. The film plot doesn't get you very emotionally invested in what's happening, especially compared to the first movie. It's pretty so so. While the original is more like an artwork movie, this one is closer to being a cartoon movie. It's a notch down, but still worth all the praises. I adored the singing of the film better than the original. There wasn't that annoying child voice singing in the film, but more beautiful quality singing adult sounding voice. I loved watching the Dreams to Dream sequence with Fievel's sister Tanya. They sure sexed up Tanya's image a lot from the first movie and probably turned a legion of males into furries. James Horner's score is breath taking as well. It's give you that huge Western feel to the film. I forgotten just how funny this movie was for me as a kid. Nothing beats the lazy eye sequence. Don Deluise is just funny as hell, anything he says in the film just makes me laugh. I'm glad they could bring the original cast back for the most part but whole thing, the plot, the characters, etc. seemed a lot more childish. Somehow I've always enjoyed this one more than its predecessor.

Unfortunately the mice are all being led into a trap which only little  Fievel Mousekewitz knows about.Fievel (Phillip Glasser again, although with not quite the same kind of cutesy  voice as he had last time understandably -- well, Glasser was close to teenage  years at this time so the inevitable voice-break was on its way), once again, gets  lost after falling off the train taking the mice West.  Unlike the first movie, where  he just had to find his parents again, this time he has to find them to warn them  of the aforementioned trap they are falling into!  There to hopefully help him are  not only his old pal Tiger (Dom DeLuise again reprising his delightful role), but  also the legendary dog sheriff Wylie Burp (voiced by the late great JamesStewart in what I believe to be his last-ever role in a feature film) -- that is, if  Fievel can get the latter to overcome a little problem he has!Is this a good movie?  Well, I'm in two minds.  Although it lacks the sentimentality  of the original (which will be either a blessing or a curse depending on your  view), it makes up for it with racier slapstick comedy and fun.  Mind you, the cats  don't seem quite as menacing this time around.  Wylie Burp is a joy to watch,  though.Technically it scores highly, too.  The characters are well-defined and sharply  drawn, and a burst of 'Somewhere Out There' from Cathy Cavadini, plus someother nice (and some fun) songs, also add to the proceedings.Basically, if you loved the original you may love this one, although not quite as  much.

It isn't as heart-warming, it isn't as dark and the voice and animation style is noticeably different. It relies heavily on sight gags and less on plot.That being said, I find very little wrong about those issues. I have a very hard time really pining down a solid plot for the first movie to begin with, since it's just a series of a scenes featuring Fievel just barely missing chances to re-unite with his family. In the second movie, he has a more pointed mission to successfully warn/protect the mice from yet another self-appointed sophisticate.The original movie was good and gave kids a glimpse into an important part of our history (immigration) but the theme was too slow and depressing to carry the full weight of two movies.The second movie, in addition to snappy animation and clever gags, brought on another 19th century mind-set, the prospect of the west and a future of not only being in America, but being a PART of America itself.Overall, despite this movie's differences from the original, it is still charming and a great deal higher in quality than other sequels.And let's be honest, what little boy doesn't dream about fighting alongside his hero?

Its good music, brilliant artwork, and fun references make American Tail Fieval goes west something worthwhile to enjoy no matter your age. While their may not be many adult innuendos, do not immediately write this of as something only your kids can watch. let childhood nostalgia fill you as you watch it and as you notice and realize new things about it!Just because something is a cartoon, doesn't mean its only for children.

Even the villain is a lovable character. PUSSY-POOOOOO!!!The animation is also much more unique in this movie. It does its job engaging the viewer to not only pay attention to the characters, but to the scenery as well. Something I felt was lacking in the first.The character animation and voice syncing is far better in the first and the lack of painted background in this one just make it feel on the low quality side, but the presence of shadow and malleability of characters in this one make it a completely different movie.The story is fast-paced and the humor is timed very well. Steven Spielberg brought us a story not like the original...

I think it is brilliant and is one of my favorite sequels, the story is really entertaining from the beginning to the finish. In this second part The Mousewith Family has already succeeded in establishing his new home in New York, after the occurred events in the first film, but the problem is that the dad is not very satisfied with the quality of life they have there, and later to escape a dangerous hunting by cats, they come floating through a tin of sardines to the sewer where they to buy some tickets to live in the west where supposedly cats and mice live together in harmony.Inside the train, Fievel hears some cat's voices in the other wagon and he goes to investigate.Inside, he found that when they reach their destination cats become all mice in mouse hamburgers.Then he decides to save his family and others from certain death.I have seen all the films from An American tail and they are all very interesting and fun but this is my favorite of all. I think that this movie is really great,His songs, the characters, everything is great, but above all his songs. I love the song dream to dream singed by Tanya, powerful and beauty at the same time.the one thing that i don't liked from this second part was the little change was that the design of the characters and the final battle was a little short, but all the other things are awesome.In conclusion, I would like to comment that after seeing so many times the four films from An American Tale Have helped me to create my own version, as I already have 30 minutes he he he and the truth is quite interesting and fun.bye "},{"Title":"Loved it when I was 6 and I still do now at 21","Date":"5 June 2007","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Family","Review":" Growing up, I must have seen An American Tail and feivel Goes West a million times. Recently, I got the DVD in a fit of nostalgia and found that I still knew every line from both movies. But while the first movie is well done and rather dark, this movie is much more lighthearted and has some incredibly amusing moments.The pace is that of a children's movie. I will admit, not a lot of time is spent on atmosphere an the tone of the movie is constantly shifting from serious/sinister (ie. Feivel gets picked up by a Hawk) to goofy (said hawk gets blasted from the sky in a shower of feathers by teeny mouse natives).But despite its pacing, it is quite entertaining. Dom DeLuise is hysterical and really develops a character in this movie. He does the prissy city cat learning to be a frontier dog so well. The animation is much crisper than the first.The song 'Dreams to Dream' caught me off guard. When I was little, I loved the song because it was cute, but watching it again, this song is really an amazing song. Much more emotional and gripping than 'My Heart Will Go On' (another James Horner single). It has that kind of epic, romance novel feel that 'I Want to Spend My Lifetime Loving You' had (yet another James Horner single from The Mask of Zorro). The Linda Ronstadt version is OK, but the orchestral movie version with Tanya singing is really fantastic.John Cleese is wonderful as he always is. Cat R. Waul's fate is classic. His attempts to remain aloof and aristocratic, but his catlike tendency to completely overreact and lose his cool when caught off guard shines through perfectly.James Stewart is great and has some really great moments. His dry, sardonic wit shows through in a lot of scenes that I completely missed as a kid. I never taught him that... when Tiger sweeps Miss Kitty off her feet and the pair vanishes off screen.Kids will love this and parents won't be bored watching it with their kids. Entertaining, brief and a lot of fun.

Even though he didn't start out in westerns (he turned to the genre to save his fledgling career in the early '50s) by the time this film was made he was a Western icon alongside Clint Eastwood or Glenn Ford (and not far behind the Duke).

If you don't see this movie for any other reason, go for the music! Dreams to Dream occurs when Tonya is washing the windows, right after Fievel wanders into the bar and right before Tanya performs, when she sings another great song.

In this one, it's dramatically different. And that sorta ruined it. Despite that flaw, this film is fun. Though it isn't nearly as kind and good hearted as the original, it's still got heart.

His head is filled with dime novel adventures as were many human kids in the 19th century of many western characters. In this case it's that famous legendary lawman, Wylie Burp given voice by another legend, James Stewart. As in the first An American Tail, Fievel Goes West is an utterly charming animated film that will appeal to both children and those reliving their childhoods. The west is just as wild as those novels make it out to be and young Fievel finds that his cat friend Tiger who sounds a lot like Dom DeLuise has gone west also.But not all cats are good, especially to the mouse community. Evil cat, John Cleese is planning a huge mouse massacre and a feast of mouse burgers for his feline cohorts.Will the evil Cleese succeed in his plan. Kids of all age, rent this film and find out.

It was a sad story, but the sadness just seemed to make me cringe-especially when the mice started to sing about it. I just couldn't get into this film.These were not my favourite Disney films.
