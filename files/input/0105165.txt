The plot is compelling and original. It is part love story, part mystery. Every time I watch it I feel transported to a place of mystery and faith. How many movies accomplish putting on the screen the power of love and the vital importance of who we are inside? Alec Baldwin is utterly convincing as he plays the part of the soul-mate who has lost is partner to the body of a dying old man. Meg Ryan radiant as a woman who never sleeps and who by the end of the movie has rediscovered hope. Watching this film should be considered medicine for the body and soul. Are you an optimist? Don't miss this film! Highly recommended.

The key to the movie is in the advice the heroine's mom gives the hero when he talks to her on the phone. The movie is about the nature of love, and whether it means more than just being attached to an attractive exterior. The magical aspect is just a way of confronting this question in a new and powerful way. Also, notice that almost the first conversation the two lovers have is about a book, The White Hotel, which is a depiction of life where the word tragic is maybe an understatement. Like many movies made from plays, the writing is crisp and to the point. Meg Ryan is fine, but Alec Baldwin is riveting when his world falls apart. He is a walking picture of grief, unable even to be civil to the bartender who is a friend. There is a great soundtrack, from the Cowboy Junkies and Lou Reed to Annie Lennox. There is one sublime moment, when the hero rises above all convention and expresses his love, leaving behind all rational, normal ideas of what is okay to do. Well, needless to say I love this movie. But hey, it is not everybody's cup of tea. Especially if you are too dumb and superficial to get it.

It was quite surprisingly a very enjoyable film, for me mostly because of the chemistry between Meg Ryan and Alec Baldwin; I thought they captured the blissful uncertainty of falling in love and thought the subtext was an interesting commentary on love and marriage and what we see in others. It's no great work of art, but it is moving and sweet. I really enjoyed watching the two leading stars. Of course they're beautiful and all that, but they managed to seem human and flawed at the same time (as did the parents) and I didn't feel this movie was overly sappy at all. They seemed to talk to each other the way people do, and less like your typical Hollywood snappy dialogue. There were some interesting and touching moments, such as the contrast between what the old man thought a married couple should act and how Alec Baldwin thought they should, as he looked longingly at the couple kissing in the pool while his new wife (possessed by the old man) chatted away with an older couple.Oscar winner Kathy Bates was totally wasted here though. I wonder if her part had been bigger and then got cut later.

Alec Baldwin and Meg Ryan are perfect together. I especially enjoyed his narration at the beginning of the movie as he describes his first encounter with Meg's character. It's all about soulmates and how they connect and they just know it was meant to be. Then there is the powerful moment after Meg Ryan and an elderly man somehow swap bodies and Baldwin looks at his wife and asks where is my wife?! because he just knows that she is not the same person he fell in love with, even though it was her body and she looked like his wife, there was something wrong...something off....when it came to her spirit and the way she thought and acted. Incredibly original stuff... to show how deep love is actually. That we could tell whether or not someone is our soulmate even if they changed physical form. It also showed how we love and embrace all those annoying little things about our lovers that we complain about and don't agree with. I thought it was extremely cute how he missed all of his wife's neurotic and strange idiosyncrasies. All of her foibles were as important to him as all of her best traits.This is a very underrated movie and a must see for anyone who is a romantic.

This is obviously a fantasy, but the supernatural elements are handled in such an understated way that it is almost believable.The best thing about this movie is Meg Ryan's face. She has never been so adorably daffy, and several scenes where she mugs outrageously are hilarious. Alec Baldwin does his best to act the role of a really nice guy caught in an impossible situation, but he fails to be totally convincing Just under the surface is his true rowdy dude persona fighting to get out.Peter (Baldwin) and Rita (Ryan) are young Chicagoans who meet and immediately fall in love. On their wedding day, their paths cross with that of Julius, a weary, ill, lonely old man. Rita and Julius momentarily envy each other's life for reasons that are surprisingly similar, and magically, their souls switch places. On the honeymoon, Peter begins to suspect that Rita is not the woman he thought he knew. He figures out what happened and this brings together Peter and Rita, now in Julius's body. The film moves toward its climax with all three principals being sorely tested trying to deal with their predicament without being taken for lunatics by their friends and family. Resolution, when it comes, is deeply moving. Inevitably, the film has a happy ending. Younger viewers will be satisfied with the ending, with everyone back in their own bodies. Older viewers will feel left hanging. Wasn't Rita more affected by her experience inside Julius's skin? Wouldn't she want to keep up a relationship with this person with whom she has shared more than anyone ever has in the history of the human race? How will she feel when he dies? Wouldn't a piece of her go with him? Furthermore, it begs credulity to assume that old Julius could figure out so fast how to dress, put on makeup and do his/her hair like Rita. And how does Rita know exactly how to dress as Julius? How does Julius (as Rita) even know which toothbrush is hers on their honeymoon? However, these are minor flaws in a film concerned with bigger questions, and most viewers will feel more or less satisfied at the end of the film.

He took a known and successful play with an original story, cast two well known Hollywood romance specialists to play the leads and let them determine how good the movie is. Alec Baldwin and Meg Ryan, the two leads, deliver quite well, making Prelude to a Kiss one of the more original, thoughtful, geniuately sweet, and overall first-rate romances in recent years. The movie begins with the common cliche total opposites attract. Peter(Baldwin) is a nerdy, somewhat conservative manager of a science information firm. His friend and co-worker(Stanley Tucci) introduces him to free-willed liberal bartender Rita(Ryan). Although the actions of Peter that first night don't exactly show it, Peter has fallen in love with Rita. The next night Peter visits Rita at her bar and after an intital akward period, the two hit it off. For a period of time, they are a couple in love and then about a half an hour into the movie, Peter poses a marriage proposal which Rita accepts. SPOILER ALERT- If you don't want to know the twist that changes the direction of the movie, stop here.Peter and Rita are married. Meanwhile we see a mysterious old man(Sydney Walker, in his film debut) wandering around and ending up at the wedding. He congradulates the bride and groom who acts civily towards them although they have no idea whats going on. The old man asks if he can kiss the bride, Rita accepts and suddenly we see a supernatural occurrence which we soon find out involves the soul switching of Rita and the old man. Eventually, Peter figures it out, and comes to the definate conclusion that Rita, the woman he loves is in the old man's body and vice versa. In quite possibly Baldwin's best movie scene ever(riviling with the memorable I own your asses lecture in Glengarry Glen Ross), he confeses to Rita's body and soon things become a mess. Peter realises he has to find the old man's body, with Rita's spul inside. I've probably given away too much at this point so I will not dare tell you the ending, although it no doubtly it will recieve mix emotions. Personally, I found the story intriguing and thoughtful, sometimes even forgetting that it was a total fantasy. The acting for the most part is wonderful. Meg Ryan's performance is as good as City of Angels, which parts of this seemed similar to. She is able to develop great chemistry throughout. Walker's debut performance is masterable. Although they are brief roles, Patty Duke and Ned Beatty perfectly fit the role of Rita's parents. One criticism I have of the film is casting talented actors like Stanley Tucci and Kathy Bates in completely nothing roles. However, like I said earlier, the key to the movie is Baldwin. In movies like Glengarry Glen Ross, Malice, and even the recent Pearl Harbor, he has been able to portray the cool, calm, man in control. However, this by far is his best performance because it's the only one that has ever let him do great things without talking. His facial expressions are as telling as prime Pacino or DeNiro. When he is overjoyed or deeply saddened, it's so genuine that the viewer feels it. Although Baldwin wasn't in the same league as 92's Oscar Winner Pacino(Scent of a woman, one of the great films of cinema) he neverless should have at least merrited a nomination and in a weaker year he probably would have. Prelude to a Kiss is not a masterpiece and does not try and go overboard in making a statement on society. It recognizes it's job, to make the viewer laugh, cry, and smile, and does it better than most movies in this genre would.Rated PG-13 for a few crude sexual remarks; however, I think Prelude could have gotten by with a PG, this is an appropriate film for kids who are interested....1 hr 50 min a 20th Century Fox release  "},{"Title":"Still a great film after 15 years!","Date":"6 January 2007","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance","Review":" I saw this film in the theater over 15 years ago and decided to revisit it.

Alec Baldwin is brilliant as usual as Peter, who falls head over heels with Rita despite all of their differences. When a strange old man kisses Rita on her wedding day, they switch bodies, and it is Peter who knows his beloved so well that he immediately figures out that Rita is not herself. When he meets the old man and wants to be with him because he knows that his wife's soul is inside the old man's sick and dying body-it's just heartbreaking. Kudos also goes to Sydney Walker, who plays the old man-his monologue about life brought me to tears, and he brings out the true spirit of who Rita really is.

Meg Ryan and Alec Baldwin portray the two main characters who meet, and fall in love. Meg Ryan's character Rita is a lovely and complex woman, frightened by living life to the fullest. On the couple's wedding day, just after the two are married, Rita comes face to face with a mysterious elderly man(Sydney walker), who nobody at the wedding seems to recognize. While everyone is trying to find out who he is, he asks if he may kiss the bride. During the kiss, the souls of Rita and the old man switch and both find themselves in the body of the other.This is no Freaky Friday or Big. It's not a comedy though there are a few funny moments. But by and large it's a love story and a touching one at that. All three of the main leads are great. Baldwin is Subtle and convincing and this maybe the best role I've seen Ryan in since When Harry Met Sally. But Walker is the standout, he being exceptionally well cast as the old man and his performance is absolutely outstanding. This is a strange story but extremely touching and for one who is tired of the same old tired romantic comedies this is a welcome change.One thing that I liked was that the movie makers did not turn this into a thriller. I kind of expected the old man to develop a disease and the movie turn into a race against time to get the souls switched back. The movie, surprisingly stayed fairly light, though there were many serious, touching moments, particularly toward the end.The best scenes, by far, occur after Baldwin recognizes his wife as the old man, and Rita, in the old man's body, learns to stop being afraid. The dialog is very good and I liked this movie. It's definitely unusual and well above average. My vote's 7.5 of 10.

I mean, Meg is adorable and Alec has nice hair on his chest. But I just couldn't get interested. I mean, Meg is cute and kinky (kinky in a nice way of course) and she sincerely worries about bringing children into this troubled world, and Alec's character has had a troubled youth. So their characters have depth, I'm sure. And he meets her parents and gets warm with her mom and watches dear old dad's embarrassing antics with his dog tattoos, and they drink beer out of the bottle and you know it's going to be true love and all that.But somehow I didn't feel any chemistry between them. I mean how would Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn play this? (Would they play it?) How about Tony Randall and Jack Klugman? What the hey, how about Abbott and Costello? And then I saw the old guy who was going to kiss her (I knew the premise) and I didn't want to see THAT. He (Sydney Walker) gets on a train at random and goes to a random destination and is fated to arrive at their wedding at exactly the right time, etc.Anyway, after a while I figured it was probably just me. After all, this is Meg Ryan who is adorable and can still play ingenue types at forty-something (she was only 31 when this was released), not to mention that this is adapted from a hit Broadway show of the same name from playwright Craig Lucas. And I guess I should add that Kathy Bates, who is a fine, fine, underrated actress (how I loved her in the film version of Stephen King's Misery 1990, boy wasn't she a nasty), is going to have a part. (Turned out to be a small part.) But still, let's face it, I'm just not the right guy to fully appreciate such a film.But then, recalling that I am an intrepid reviewer and realizing I have an obligation to my public who need to see cutesy movies trashed--that, and noticing that today's rerun of Seinfeld is one I've seen three times--I flicked the VCR back on and tried to watch with my eyes closed. That didn't work, so I tried it with the sound off. I thought it might be interesting to try and guess what they were doing by just watching. (You can observe a whole lot by just watching, I've been told. In fact, Yogi told me that.) Then I decided I better turn the sound back on because I knew that this kiss by an old man is going to turn the bride into somebody with the mind of the old man or something like that, and I had better catch what's going on.Okay I'm still hanging in there and this is actually getting good. No, I mean it. Meg is now an old man (in her soul) and they're in Jamaica and she's dressing old man weird and loving life and Alec is wondering what happened to the woman he married.I won't say any more except that Meg handles her new persona rather well, and Alec is very professional. Still I have to warn you that it gets syrupy at the end and there's a deep layer of what it means to be in love with someone over and above their sexuality--and that's good. However what really bothered me about this movie was that Meg Ryan was too skinny. She needs to quit stressing and relax a little, have some chocolate mousse and realize it's okay to be thirty-something then and forty-something now.(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

For that matter, her parents should have had more screen time. Yes, I realize the plot did not call for that, but they were funny. Meg and Alec weren't, and then again maybe I am missing the point maybe they're not supposed to be funny.From the moment Alec began doing voice-overs, I knew we were in for a long night. If the acting doesn't explain what is going on, and if exposition would run the film too long, then something is wrong with the story.There is another basic problem Meg, for all her charm and spunk....I hear Lou Grant saying 'I hate spunk'....cannot convince me that she is the ditz of a bartender in the first part. The role was created 15-20 years too late and needs someone like the young Goldie Hawn, a more physical actress.To summarise, BIG is better.

I suspect that she will look back on this movie the way Dustin Hoffman looks back on Ishtar. Meg plays a woman so dissatisfied with her life that simply kissing someone transforms her into the other body. Now this is not a completely unique premise...remember Like Father, Like Son with Dudley Moore? That was actually a somewhat funny movie, however the premise doesn't work when trying to be serious. I think Meg must have been relieved to have success the following year with Sleepless in Seatle...because Prelude was a disaster. In fact, the only reason I'm taking my time writing a review about this horrible movie is to warn you not to spend your money renting it!

What a disappointment this proved to be.The plot had the potential to make this film almost watchable, but they approached it in such a politically correct, timid way that you could see where it was leading from beginning to end. Meg Ryan was as dizzy as ever and Alec Baldwin got more annoying as the film progressed.I don't think I shall be watching this again in a hurry.

Baldwin and Ryan are newly wed when an old man asks to kiss the bride. Somehow, Meg Ryan and the old man exchange souls, and we have another body-swapping mix-up in the vein of BIG, VICE VERSA, 13 GOING ON 30, LIKE FATHER LIKE SON, 18 AGAIN, etc, etc... only PRELUDE TO A KISS never aspires to anything madcap or screwball, like each of those other films. Furthermore, it's not especially insightful or well-written. So the body-swap twist never amounts to much, plot-wise. We never get BIG  laughs, or even 18 AGAIN laughs, for that matter.  By the end of the film, I would have settled for a few VICE VERSA size chuckles. Ho-hum...

Fine. Now think, if your partner or someone very close to you actually did swap souls with someone, how long would it take you to come to such a far-out conclusion. Alec Baldwin's character apparently only took a week to decide the only logical explanation for his wife's strange behavior was that she'd been body snatched! WHAT! I've known my wife for six years and I think it'd probably take me at least a year to even consider soul swapping as a possibility. It's way, way down on the list of reasons why people are acting strange.Yeah.. it just proceeds from there. Though, it was probably better than Steve Martin's A Simple Twist of Fate or Balls of Fury, but only barely.

We even managed free popcorn and drinks. It wasn't worth what we paid. What little bit of the movie I saw showed no range of emotion from Meg Ryan, who, try as she might, can't seem to ever get more than perky in any of her roles, at least, the ones I've seen. Ned Beatty, who I appreciate as an actor gave a stale performance, as did the rest of the case.Although, I left after about 30 minutes, so take this review for what it's worth. It may have gotten much better after we left. However, it bears noting that we walked out of a movie that we got into for free and got free munchies for. "}]
