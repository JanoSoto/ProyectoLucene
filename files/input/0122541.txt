[{"Title":"Wit, depth and beauty - Will Wilde follow Shakespeare to Hollywood?","Date":"18 June 1999","Score":"36 out of 42 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  As I left this movie, someone said How nice to see an intelligent movie!The risk going in was that it would be ONLY an intelligent - or at least clever - piece, all period manners and costumes. In fact, with all the Oscar Wilde wit which sounds wonderfully fresh here, there are also rich moments of emotional depth throughout this amusing but also quite moving film.One theme here - touching in hindsight - is how little it can take to destroy a reputation - Wilde was later to have some of the most painful possible firsthand experience of this.  But the central question here, which anchors the humor and beauty that decorate it, is the cost of rigorous, even rigid, honesty. And the growth of the central characters on this point shines through, even through the dance of wit and farce.Underpinning this is a surprising faith in human nobility, quite in contrast to the ironic persona Wilde maintained.  It struck me while watching it both that Wilde had very French characteristics - a continental finesse, the love of repartee - and yet was profoundly an English writer by virtue of his faith in fair play and the bonds of (platonic) male friendship.In fact, Lord Goring, whose world-weary ways make him something of a surrogate for Wilde, is a distant cousin to Sidney Carton in coming to the defense of a 'nobler' friend even at great (possible) sacrifice to himself. His very lack of seriousness is what makes his efforts on behalf of his friends so moving.With this, the pure visual beauty of actors like Cate Blanchett and Rupert Everett, matched by sumptuous costumes and sets, adds a sensuous element which, in a lesser film, might have dominated the movie. They, with Minnie Driver in cheeky comic form and Julianne Moore sweetly evil and superbly English, make it a delight both to watch and to savor later as tart food for thought.

It is far better than that.  Oliver Parker's revitalizing of Oscar Wilde's classic play is filmmaking at its finest.Every element of this film is superlative.  Wilde's story as adapted to the screen by Parker is witty, intelligent and engaging from start to finish. Seldom can you find a story that attempts to be a romantic comedy, a tale of duplicity blackmail and betrayal, and a drama of political intrigue, and succeeds so well on all counts.The intricate weave of deception, manipulation and double entendre along with comic misperception, irony and rapier witted dialogue are delicious and classic Wilde.  This is a film you will want to see again and again, just to discover all the lines within the lines.I cannot say enough about the brilliance of Oliver Parker's direction in this film.  He has captured late 19th Century aristocratic England with vivid and rich images that put the viewer right into the period.  David Johnson's cinematography is fantastic, with every scene working well as to lighting and color.  The beautiful blend of colors in the costumes and the set always looked like they belonged together.  Parker also provides numerous interesting camera angles that help dramatize the scenes.  It serves to remind us that glorious films can still be made relying on the creative eye of the director rather than special effects.The acting was delightful.  Rupert Everett, as the self absorbed Lord Arthur Goring, delivers an exquisite performance as the unscrupulous rogue upon whom the mantle of truth and honor is laid.Julianne Moore was delightful as the evil and cunning Mrs. Cheveley.  As cold, manipulative and heartless as she is with Chiltern and Lady Chiltern, she is that vulnerable and helpless with Lord Goring, for whom she has long held a flame.  Moore handles this emotional juggling act with great skill and you find yourself simultaneously loving her ingeniousness and hating her treachery.Cate Blanchett turns in another wonderful performance as the oh-so-perfect, Lady Gertrud Chiltern.  Jeremy Northam is also excellent as Robert Chiltern, the man of untouchable character with a scandalous secret in his past.  Even Minnie Driver is charming as Robert's sister.This is a terrific film for the refined viewer who appreciates all aspects of filmmaking.  Even for those not into the art of filmmaking, it is simply great entertainment.  I can think of no negative criticism of it.  It is well written, directed, photographed and acted.  It is filmmaking the way it was meant to be.  A perfect 10.

Goring So my mother tells me.Even if was concocted for the film, that line still contains the essence of Wilde and the essence of all modern British humor, for which, I should say, I'm a major sucker.  While watching An Ideal Husband, I didn't object to the lack of suspense as long as Rupert Everett was working his way around those Wilde lines, which he does as well as anyone I've ever heard.I used to think Stephen Fry was Wilde on earth, but Fry is something wonderfully different -- Everett is Wilde on earth, or at least the actor that Wilde should have had around to deliver those lines when he wrote them. I first saw Everett in The Madness of King George, for which he put on weight.  Every review of that film mentioned this; I thought the attention excessive,  but when I saw him lying shirtless in a sauna, I understood. The man is, shall we say, cut.  I can only imagine the effect of that scene on straight women or gay men -- probably something akin to the effect Greta Scacchi's I think we're alone now smile at the end of The Coca-Cola Kid has on me.An Ideal Husband is full of good performances, with one glaring exception the usually great Julianne Moore.  Her scenes are curiously leaden, and Parker -- whose fault this may be -- has the camera linger over her as though the exposure will convince us how evil she is.  The one exception is her scene with Everett, which has a real Will he sleep with the enemy? tension.  It may be that Moore was just outclassed by the Brits, who are born to this stuff.Cate Blanchett, whom I've seen in three movies, two of which were British period pieces, continues to amaze me with her range.The unsung hero of the movie is Jeremy Northam, who takes a thankless role -- the man in the play who isn't the Oscar Wilde figure -- and makes it emotionally compelling.  He is responsible for the play's only real suspense and emotion, since the rest is word games, more or less.All of which leads me to blame the production's shortcomings on its writer/director, Oliver Parker.  He seems to have squandered an outstanding cast.  The play's final scene is played as a series of French scenes -- a film term for a series of different scenes in the same location -- and this kills any momentum that scene might have had.Three out of four stars, I say, which makes it better than 90% of the movies out there.

Sir Robert's sister Mabel (Minnie Driver) is infatuated with Sir Robert's friend, Lord Arthur Goring (Rupert Everett.)  The dashing Lord Goring, the wealthy son of the Earl of Caversham, is an inveterate bachelor who lives a life of leisure.  Into this already crowded picture drops Mrs. Laura Cheveley (Julianne Moore,) an Austrian socialite with two ex-husbands and a convoluted past.  Not only was she briefly engaged to Lord Goring, but it seems that she possesses evidence that the noble Sir Robert once committed a terrible indiscretion.  Mrs. Cheveley uses this explosive evidence in her attempt to blackmail Sir Robert into voting against his conscience on the floor of Parliament.  What ensues is a fascinating examination of honor and idealism.  We learn that the noble Sir Robert is less than perfect, while the rakish bachelor Lord Goring possesses a surprising level of honor and insight.If Shakespeare in Love deserved an Oscar, this film deserves the Nobel Prize.  It is simply outstanding in every respect.  The first thing one notices is the dialogue.  It is a bit stiff and stilted, as was the custom in London at the time, but it also possesses a razor sharp wit and sly sense of humor.  Every last character speaks with intelligence and humor.  The verbal fireworks, particularly as provided by Lord Goring, illuminate character and motivation while simultaneously producing guffaws from the audience.  The plot structure is a marvel.   There are no explosions, fireballs, or car chases, but the picture achieves a certain breathlessness simply through its intricate layering of multiple characters, all with intertwining motivations, interests, and connections with one another.  A prime example of this is the scene in which poor Lord Goring receives multiple visitors at his home in a single night.  All of the visitors have conflicts with one another, so Lord Goring must segregate them and move from room to room, listening to their problems and providing insights.  The costumes and locations are all excellent.  I particularly liked the manner in which Sir Robert's bright home is contrasted with Lord Goring's dark and cavernous bachelor pad.  The one complaint I have is with the film's music; it seemed too light and frivolous, overplaying the madcap shenanigans element of the picture.  But this is a minor quibble indeed.The acting is first rate across the board.  Jeremy Northam (yes, he could play James Bond) is well suited to the role of Sir Robert.  He exudes intelligence, honor, and duty.  Julianne Moore, as Mrs. Cheveley, seems to relish the conniving and scheming of her character.  Cate Blanchett and Minnie Driver capably bring depth and intelligence to their limited roles. But the true star of the film is Rupert Everett as Lord Arthur Goring. Mr. Everett has had a promising career to this point, but An Ideal Husband is his breakout role.  In this film he is witty, charming, caring, wise, devilish, and childish all at once.  Lord Goring is the kind of man that makes women swoon and men flock around to hear funny stories.  He reminded me of Cary Grant - only better.  Someone give that man an Academy Award.

The story is not unfamiliar --- politics, blackmail, love, and friendship.  What is different however is how these are viewed thru the prism of the Victorian Era, the centerpiece of the film.  The cast was superb from Jeremy Northam, Sir Robert Chiltern the title character, to Cate Blanchett, Lady Gertrud Chiltern his wife, to Minnie Driver, Mabel Chiltern his sister, to Rupert Everett, Lord Arthur Goring his friend, and Julianne Moore, Mrs. Cheveley.  The minor characters of Lord Goring's father and butler were good as well.  Although all were very good, Rupert Everett stole the show.  His character is the one who connects all the others and does so with grace, charm, and wit.  Which brings me to my final point, the film is filmed filled with witty dialogue and double-entendre a la Oscar Wilde.  I went to see this movie twice.  It was that good and appreciated it more the second time. I can not see how this movie could have been better.  Four stars!!!

There is always a Wildean character to reverse a clicheed expression or invert conventional 'wisdom.' Unfortunately, by stripping most of his characters of their stiff formality and rigid social code, the writer and director have removed the butt of the joke and Wilde's comments on absurdity are left without a punchline. The attempt to work in anachronistic social relevance leaves us with a set of feeble characters who fall in love with each other for no obvious reason. Because Wilde's language has been sterilised the actors have to use mugging to express the personalities Wilde created. Result, a charmless and dated 'political' drama as credible as a Jeffery Archer novel. Gertrude is insecure and fretful where she should be smug and priggish- Mabel is arch where she should be caustic- Poor Oscar - gets no 'Oscar'!

That's certainly a thread in the movie, but in the marketing of this version, they made it appear as if it was the entire wardrobe.I didn't see the film when it was in theaters because these ads, with their very modern music and fast cutting, made the film look like a joke.But when it came out on video, I decided to try it, and am glad I did.The film itself is excellent.

It's a masterful job of translating from stage to screen.  It's really so crisply done, and very funny.In years to come people will realise that this is a fine movie version of this play.

If you want to see a much better film set in approximately the same time period in England, go see THE WINSLOW BOY (though it's not a comedy).  If you are in the mood for laughs and wit, go see NOTTING HILL.  Both films did what An Ideal Husband attempted and failed to do.One last point to hammer home-- the close-ups of Rupert Everett's left ear revealed 2 earring holes (an anachronism or at least a reminder that THIS IS A MOVIE).

It's impossible not to enjoy the fire-works of wit so smoothly offered by the Irish writer. Yet An ideal husband almost succeeds to be a boring film.It should be observed that An ideal husband is Wilde's fourth play not only chronologically, but also with respect to the artistic level. In particular, the dramatic turns of the plot and the design of the moral scruples of the characters are decidedly weak. Therefore, to focus on these aspects of the play, as the movie does, is a major mistake. The Oliver Parker's script of the film presents several changes with respect to Wilde's original text. You easily recognize the added lines they are so flat compared with the true ones! One scene is so un-Wildean that it has to be remarked in the Turkish bath Lord Goring (the author's alter-ego) shows his gym-built muscles. Nothing could grate more with the spirit of Oscar Wilde, who always addressed his most ferocious sarcasm against the fashion/mania of sport, gymnastics and physical shape.The acting is surprisingly flat (save Peter Vaughan and John Wood in two minor roles). Actually, Rupert Everett as lord Goring makes an adequate job nothing memorable, though. To compare him with Cary Grant is sheer blasphemy. One can't believe how misfit Jeremy Northam is to play Robert Chiltern he really makes an awful performance. Minnie Driver as Mabel Chiltern is not much better, with her perpetual half-stunned, half-whining expression. Moreover she is ugly (sorry). Julianne Moore is generally considered a first-rate actress I don't know, but here she certainly doesn't show her talent. Needless to say, Moore is unattractive, too. Now let me ask is there a LAW AGAINST BEAUTIFUL ACTRESSES in current movies? Is such a law some form of political correctness? Let some Foundation for Endangered Species preserve Catherine Zeta-Jones for all us...  An ideal husband is a forgettable movie a routine work that produce poor results from Wilde's brilliant matter.

Instead, what they do is create ever high levels of annotation on the situation, each at a higher level of abstraction than before, all the while keeping the plate spinning form the prior effort. This is not a profound vehicle by any means, but it is profound acting.This project is also lovely if you love language. Wilde knew how to form the most succinct quips, much better than Shaw, his only competition. Most of this is framed as dialog that flies back and forth almost too fast. Wilde is where Capra found his notion of screwball, so in a sense almost everything we see on screen is influenced by Wilde's few plays.This project is also lovely if you are into self-reference as the basis of art, that kind of art that defines how we advance our ability to abstract, especially how to abstract cool soft stuff like love. Here, we have Wilde writing about the dangers of the written word; how one committed, words constrain every element of everything that follows. The best we can do in life (he seems to say) is to just begin writing it and adapt to the consequences. (We have a key scene with our friends attending a play, another Wilde one.

Although it contains many elements of a classic Feydeau farce - comic misunderstandings, delicately timed missteps, hairbreadth missed encounters - the film lacks the kinetic energy necessary to allow these elements to completely shine through.  Instead, we are treated to a more laid back, more traditionally British interpretation of the events.  Indeed, the real charm of the film lies in its sharp observation of British gentility thinly disguising the often honey-tongued brutality lying just below the placid surface of this society.  No one smiles more sincerely or maintains such immense social poise while slicing one's opponents to shreds than the elite of England - and this quality director Oliver Parker captures in complete fidelity to Wilde's overall vision.Jeremy Northam portrays a highly respected and happily married member of the House of Commons who is suddenly confronted with a moral dilemma  should he allow a blackmailer to expose an egregiously immoral action in his past, thereby ensuring the ruination of both his career and his marriage, or should he go along with the blackmailer's demands and publicly support a cause he knows to be highly unethical and injurious to both his people and his nation?  Julianne Moore portrays the woman who waltzes suddenly into his life and attempts to threaten him into supporting a doomed canal project to protect her own financial investment.  Rupert Everett also stars as a confirmed bachelor who manages to become intricately involved in everyone's affairs.The film succeeds most when it concentrates on the stuffiness of the stiff-upper-lipped British tradition juxtaposed to the single-minded viciousness of the Moore character.  She delivers a delightful interpretation of an amoral woman utilizing cruelty to achieve her desired ends, fitting perfectly into a morally topsy-turvy world which feasts on scandal and the ruination of its own members, yet where a mismatched tea set stands as the ultimate in moral turpitude.  Wilde, on the other end of the morality spectrum, also subtly jabs at the unrealistic obsession with virtue in the character of Northam's impossibly pure wife (Cate Blanchett);  she erects so high a moral pedestal for her husband to stand upon that it is only after she has been caught in a moral infraction herself that the world these characters inhabit can come back into any sort of balance.The film is probably least effective when trying to cope with the complex interweaving and overlapping of the characters and their situations. Packer simply does not provide the manic energy and chaotic pacing necessary to make such plot mechanics soar on screen.  As a result, An Ideal Husband is more likable as a genteel British comedy of manners than the unbridled drawing room farce it seems so often to want to be.  Still, this is a film to be savored and enjoyed on many levels.

The thesaurus tells me that good replacement words might be intelligent or whimsical, but those don't feel right, no no. Because the character of Lord Goring, whom you will find on the DVD cover played by Rupert Everett, is not bright or smart or even epigrammatic. He is witty, and that is that. He is spoiled and self-indulgent, but one cannot deny his gift of wit - his ability to go through life spinning any seriousness into a joke has given him an inherent superiority over the rest of his community. Life is never a drag, it's always a party. Until it isn't.One of his old flames comes into town to do some business with a close friend, Sir Robert Chiltern, who has much political power. This woman, Mrs. Chevely (a devilish Julianne Moore), happens to know some damaging information about Robert's past and blackmails him into publicly supporting a particular scheme she has invested in. It's really an unexpected turn for a story that starts so light and comical (unless you're already familiar with Wilde's work). The drama between Goring, Cheveley, Chiltern, and his wife is sometimes tense, sometimes funny, and sometimes bittersweet. The story operates not only as a romantic comedy, but also as a political drama and blackmail thriller. One scene that serendipitously brings all of the principals together at Goring's house manages every emotional low and high within the span of a single 10 or 15-minute scene.I must say, however, that much of this tale depends too heavily on coincidence and silence to create its drama. Every story contains some amount of coincidence, and this was originally a play - a cast of dozens wasn't possible, so all manner of problems had to exist between these certain people and those people alone. I can forgive that much even in an adaptation. But so much conflict could have been avoided if these characters simply talked to each other about the obstacles they faced. Too often a character will be about to say something, then stop, as if it would be rude to continue. These silences are not played well. It looks not like a character is so distraught he or she is unable to speak, but merely like they decided to say nothing further, and no one could change their minds. It feels arbitrary, not natural.That's all direction though, not only the actors. For the most part, the entire cast is wonderful. This movie makes me long for more like it, not in setting and subject matter necessarily, but in its wit. Hollywood makes movies based around a catchy concept instead of a cast of characters (unless the character IS the concept, like in Bubble Boy). This isn't anything new, but An Ideal Husband made me see it with new eyes. Maybe I should start up Stage Plays With Mark...http//www.movieswithmark.com "},{"Title":"The perfect wife finds she loves her ideal husband enough to forgive his ethical error thereby becoming the less than perfect wife.","Date":"2 September 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" How refreshing to find a movie for grown-ups!

It is the same in The Ideal Husband, where the viewers know quite many things more than Robert Chiltern does. The dialogs are witty and elegant. The sets are lavish and grand as I would expect from the nobles. The best of all is Cate Blanchett's acting, she is able to delivery a wide range of emotions throughout with relative ease.

Julianne Moore portrayed the conniving blackmailer Mrs. Laura Chevely particularly well; her very pale skin helped to accentuate the character's coldness, in my opinion.

She is such a talented actress.Because the film is set in Victorian England, some might find its pace rather slow and dull, especially those who are action lovers.

This sorry state of affairs is our fault, not Victorian England's.  Look at the works written and set in that age, by, and this is but a list of those I'm familiar with, Charles Dickens, Robert Louis Stevenson, Arthur Conan Doyle, Oscar Wilde, H.G. Wells, W.S. Gilbert, Lewis Carroll, Bram Stoker ... all manner of stories, and it's hard to believe that they're presenting portraits of the same society.  They certainly treat very different themes.  Yet when these authors' works are filmed, they come out identical to one another tedious studies in just how repressed and artificial the Victorians were.  We seem to have a collective one-track mind.This is the exception that gets things right.  Parker has simply, although it's a good deal less simple than it sounds, placed a good story in its proper setting and told it well.  He's also successfully made a movie out of the play (the photography is excellent), which is an added achievement.  He was fortunate in the play he began with.  I hadn't encountered Wilde's `An Ideal Husband' before seeing the movie; it's a much cleverer work than `The Importance of Being Ernest', just as funny when it wants to be, and yet more evidence that the nihilistic Wilde we think we know is a fabrication, dreamed up by people who have only read `Ernest' and the beginning, but not the end, of `The Picture of Dorian Gray'.  Wilde draws his moral clearly and elegantly, leaving us (if anything) delighted at having been so skilfully preached at.  In fact he draws his moral several times in succession, and each time it's better than the last.Even a film so good as this one is likely to have one error of judgement, but luckily we get it over with quickly when we first lay eyes on Lord Goring, as his butler enters his bedroom, we see an out-of-focus naked woman, presumably a prostitute, sneak out.  Presumably this lets us know that he leads a feckless life but we would have found out a few seconds later in any event; and it's not obviously in keeping with his character.  Nor is it really in keeping with Wilde's play.  (How can it be, since it's never referred to again?)  Indeed, this one lapse on Parker's part fails to injure the rest of the film only because we promptly forget about it.

"},{"Title":"A pleasant trip to the theatrical museum","Date":"15 January 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  Oscar Wilde would no doubt be amused and delighted to see audiences enjoying his plays a hundred years later. Theatre is the most ephemeral of arts and few plays, divorced of their time and place, have real impact. There is also the problem of putting a play on film so that it does not look like a filmed play. The director, Oliver Parker here had an adequate budget and uses some gorgeous settings but sticks fairly closely to Wilde's (edited)script. This involves some remarkable timing coincidences which you can get away with in the theatre but often look a bit strange in the more naturalistic film medium.Rupert Everett is perfectly cast as Lord Goring, the idlest man in London, and the most Wilde-like of all the characters. Just in case we don't get the wrong idea about him (he has a pretty lush manner) we are shown a naked woman slipping from his bed as his manservant (Peter Vaughan) enters in the morning with a hangover cure and the Times. Goring becomes involved in the affairs of his friend Sir Richard Chiltern (Jeremy Northam) a rising young politician who has married an old flame of Goring's, the naive and high-principled Gertrude (Cate Blanchett.) Richard is being blackmailed by the dubious Mrs Cheveley (an old school acquaintance of Gertrude's) (Julianne Moore) over some equally dubious past financial dealings involving the Suez Canal. Goring, who has being dallying a little with Richard's sister Mable (Minnie Driver) (Richard's daughter in the play), is being pressured by his blimpish father Caversham (John Wood) to get married. Naturally after many twists and turns and several elegant events all is resolved but Wilde makes some serious points on the way including the very pertinent one; just where is this very elegant rich, powerful and money-mad society headed? A hundred years later we know - to a bloody end in the First World War. So is this just museum theatre, reverently done? The dialogue here is not as uniformly sparkling as The Importance of Being Earnest, a much frothier piece, though a few lines endure (to love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong relationship) and the pace slows down at the end. The acting is generally very fine, though Minnie Driver doesn't quite fit, and Rupert Everett clearly enjoys himself throughout. The rich decore is almost overpowering - everything seems to be on show - and there is even a fragment of a performance of Earnest with Wilde himself appearing at the end to take the curtain call. Well, perhaps that's the point. The original play was written to put bums on seats and amuse the paying customers. These days the customers are likely to be pretty elderly. The film is not likely to appeal to a younger audience in the way Shakespeare in Love did. As for the lust for money being the root of our evils, so what else is new? And who needs an ideal husband? These days we all need wives.  "}{"Title":"Wilde about Oscar","Date":"5 January 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  This a wonderful piece of English Comedy Drama.

The story is very interesting and the ways the characters respond to an unfolding, complex puzzle is sometimes (pleasantly) surprising.

I didn't think that is was too complicated or it was such a bore that you had to concentrate to the max all through the film (although the reviewer is a remarkably intelligent individual ) and I certainly didn't think it was too nice as has been described; Wilde tended to write stuff that was too weird to happen in real life, and lets face it, most of Hollywood would be guilty of the same crime, if indeed it is a crime.However, don't expect too much, and you'll get quite a bit.

In 1895 Wilde was also sent to prison.	It's obvious that Wilde had a keen appreciation of the hypocritical and scandalously corrupt nature of the London society around which these plays were set. This was to large measure the grist for his mill. 	Wilde had a cutting wit and a profound appreciation of the value of secrecy, even if he didn't apply those principals sufficiently well to his own behaviour. Satire can be dangerous for the satirist.But it's also obvious that his personality, or was it his sexuality, precluded him being careful enough. He was doomed by his love of scandal, and of young boys.But was he fundamentally dishonest? How corrupt was Wilde? At least he worked for a living!There's no doubt that Wilde wasn't an ideal husband but it could be argued by the more liberal, by the lovers of his brilliance, that he was an ideal citizen.He was certainly one of the cleverest, one of the most entertaining. The Picture Of Dorian Grey and The Importance Of Being Earnest established that without a doubt.And he could well have been of better calibre, and possessed of nobler intentions, than The Ideal Husband he portrays in his play.By Wilde's thesis, An Ideal Husband was corrupt and rich, as is An Ideal Politician.In the film a politician called Sir Robert, (Jeremy Northern, fresh from The Winslow Boy) is a paragon of virtue.He's introduced to the film as a great orator and leader. He's Prime Ministerial material. He's a loving to his wife and utterly honest.His wife Gertrude (Australia's Cate Blanchett in another terrific performance) is sweetness and purity itself.  Unfortunately years before Robert had been a secretary for a government Minister and had sold secret  information for a huge sum of money. How else could he, a poor man, have got into a position of power? There were no seats in parliament for common men.Mrs Cheverley (American actress Julianne Moore) blackmails Robert with evidence of his sordid past. Will Sir Robert protect his career or give penance for his sins and confess all.All ends well when dear Gertrude in effect takes the money and runs, possibly to become a Prime Minister's wife. Everyone is delighted when even Gertrude joins the club and actually, giggling, confesses to telling a lie.And as for Sir Robert, well he's exposed to those who love him as corrupt and then exalted even higher. Everyone is relieved that he's been sullied. Now they know they can trust him.End of play.There's another subplot or two, cleverly written, as we would expect from Mr Wilde, (screenplay by the film's director Oliver Parker). These involve blossoming love between Robert's sister Mabel (Minnie Driver) and his best friend Goring (Rupert Everett?) but I find these Rule Britannia, London season films increasingly offensive.Australians are soon to vote on whether Australia should throw over England and become a Republic. Monarchists are likely to find An Ideal Husband to be ideal. Republicans I would hope  might find it a little disturbing.

This film, smartly, finds a way to resolve all the woes its characters inflict upon each other in a most honest and noble way.  Of all the fine acting, Julianne Moore's poker face, conniving self is the best.  She repeats what Lord Goring said earlier that to love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance.

In the days when Mr. Bean, Keeping Up Appearances, and other such poppycock are popping up in main stream american public television, this dash of panache and true British wit was truly spectacular.Although a prerequisite for any period film of any genre, the cinematography and scene/set work were brilliant.  From the rugs to the chandeliers to the statues, all pieces fit together to create an atmosphere of aristocratic British society.  Beyond the visual effect, at one point Lord Gorring (Rupert Everett-A Midsummer Night's Dream), in a moment of confusion, delivers immaculately a monologue to a small statue.  The director not only used setting to create an atmosphere, but also for something with which the actors can interact.  On a director/cinematography note, the voyeuristic glance at British parliament under moonlight was stunning, possibly the best visual image all year, next to the Red Violin.As well as cinematography, the costuming for this movie could stand alone. It was like a witty fashion show, parading flowing gowns and Lord Goring's tedious flower decisions in style and elegance.  Oscars perhaps?The script, which I believed was edited/screenplayed by Oliver Parker (Othello), was marvelous.  I was taken back to high school English class and Pride and Prejudice, where double entendre and irony brought feelings of omniscience and joy.

I cared about the characters and thusly cared about their futures, which is necessary.  The public may be surprised that Oscar-caliber performances (Everett and Northam chiefly) have come so early this film year.This movie shone from start to finish.  Combining the elegance of British wit with a superb cast and miraculous technical work, Oliver Parker has redeemed himself for massacaring one of Shakespeare's greatest scripts into two hours of choppy nonsense (Othello).  This romantic period comedy should be indulged like a fine wine, or like one's self, for, as Lord Goring would say, To love one's self is the beginning of a life-long romance.

Margaret Mitchell, as a child, was posed this rhetorical question by her mother, and eventually came to terms with its  disturbing possibilities by writing the pop classic Gone With the Wind; Wilde's An Ideal Husband proposes to answer a similar question by narrowing the scope to enclose a wife's disillusionment with the person she thought was her husband (the husband, Sir Robert Chiltern, she discovers early in the story, rose to wealth and political influence by peddling a state secret that would influence certain market investments). It appears to be an earlier (I'm  guessing) prototype of the more tightly written Lady  Windermere's Fan by the same author; the twist is that Lady Chiltern, unlike Lady Windermere, is not mistaken in her disillusionment, and, whether or not she'll decide to end the marriage, must pass through that membrane that divides her ideal life from the present reality of  marriage to someone she now finds to be utterly human, or worse. Don't be scared off by the darker implications, however this is very much a comedy.Lady Windermere was only halfway out the door when the situation resolved itself as a comic misunderstanding; the comedy at the heart of An Ideal Husband is the realization that one can survive real disillusionment, and, barring a trainwreck or certain  disastrous acts of God, inevitably will live beyond  one's honeymoon with life and get on with being married to reality.If these story elements sound a lot like Ibsen, I think it's that Ideal Husband is intended to lampoon A Doll's House, by confronting a tragic Nora type heroine with a more Coward-ly, Wilde entourage telling her to get over herself and perhaps serve martinis. One element the works have in common is that the conflict is brought to light by a blackmailer,  except that in this case the blackmailer, Mrs. Chevely, is a woman and  her victim, Chiltern, is a man, introducing the  possibility that the  victim's wife, also a woman, is closer to understanding the enemy's devices; also that perhaps society's  private and public  situations are more controlled  by women than the men would normally suppose.To what extent this film is rewritten from an actual Wilde script I can't say offhand. There are moments when the unmistakably Wilde ironic joke formula, a la The  Importance of Being Earnest, leaks through (Did you do something wrong? I certainly hope you did, because people who do right all the time are so stuffy and so on),  perhaps a bit threadbare to regular Wilde fans. At other times the dramatic and comedic pace slows to that of a more realistically-constructed contemporary movie. These latter devices, however, could also be Wilde, who was  certainly more than capable of portraying deeply felt, serious emotions and offsetting them with farcical humor.Cate Blanchett, as Lady Gertrude Chiltern, is effective as someone who makes a transition from bliss to less than bliss, with a careworn look about the eyes reminiscent of Emma Thompson. Julianne Moore is an appropriately chic blackmailer for comedy (take that, Nils Krogstad!). Minnie Driver, in an important supporting role, also suffers  admirably with the same offbeat, haunting beauty that made her a hit in The Governess. As Lord Arthur Goring, the friend to whom Chiltern (Jeremy Northam) turns to help resolve this crisis, Rupert Everett comes the closest to embodying the soul and wit of Wilde himself, as a dandy and a bored, perhaps even occasionally sneering socialite who is, nevertheless, not immune to human emotion nor  compassion toward others. These two men, like the  principal cast as a whole, are attractive, and one scene in a Turkish bath, where they recline perhaps a bit too close to each other, faintly suggests that, as in Wilde's own life, the secrets veiled within a supposedly ideal marriage may have even more levels than the audience has been shown. In general, I'd say this film is less entertaining than Lady Windermere, or some of the Shaw comedies (Heartbreak House; Fanny's First Play) that deal with similar  situations of people getting on with their lives after exposure to scandal or disillusionment. These comparisons are at a pretty high level, of course, and it's safe to say that anything worthy of being compared to Shaw is  worth seeing. Compared to the usual group of film comedies that are out there, this one is genuinely funny, and  therefore a rare experience not to be missed.

The film is based on a story by Oscar Wilde who wrote it over one hundred years ago.  In its charming way, it proves to us that a story can be successful even with time as its enemy. The recent retelling of  William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, certainly has been mistreated over the years resulting in a disastrous event Shakespeare would have been appalled with. With this movie, Oscar Wilde would have been generally proud.The film takes place in 1895 in London. It details a blackmail scheme between Sir Robert Chiltern (Jeremy Northam) his wife, Lady Gertrud Chiltern (Cate Blanchett) and Mrs. Laura Cheveley (Julianne Moore). Laura, a former classmate of Gertrud's who is visiting from Vienna, blackmails Robert into supporting an Argentine canal, a proposal he's ready to damn in Parliament, but that will bring her more riches. If he doesn't obey she will make a letter public containing secrets of Robert's past that did two things 1) made her former husband wealthy in the highest and 2) details the origins of his own fortune.There are other happenings going on at the same time that ultimately keep us intrigued. There is the social reception, Lord Arthur Goring, (Rupert Everett as the Ideal Husband, who was also in A Midsummer Night's Dream,) and his hidden love for Mabel Chiltern (Minnie Driver), his father's desire for Arthur to wed, and many other lesser blackmail gambles that keep the audience at a peek of tension.The movie's structure is generally effective as it brings to our attention a main problem, complications, character issues, gradually raising the tension level, and finally a pleasant solution that is needed for this type of entertainment. In other words the film ultimately works.I think a little more time could have been taken with the blackmail subject, for it was not completely sufficient. The character's lives, which are somewhat irrelevant, aren't really at stake here, although with some social aspects they are. I was not totally concerned of what the outcome was going to be. I knew that either of the two paths it could have followed weren't life threatening, nor were they all that drastic-in my opinion. Thank goodness for the side characters and sub-plots. The movie relayed on the blackmail a little too heavy for what it is worth.The performances were exquisite and appetizing. Rupert Everett recovers from his earlier catastrophe, Midsummer Night's Dream, and is charming and witty. Julianne Moore is a perfect villain as she is deceiving and slyly crafted to a type of hidden evil. Cate Blanchett is a nice looking and acting wife of a major public icon. Jeremy Northam handles his character with the appropriate stress and tension level. But Minnie Driver wasn't all that great, just something about her struck me as a smiling misfit without aim r direction in the movie.I am recommending An Ideal Husband because I think it is an intelligent and convincing period epic. However, I wouldn't choose this film over some of the recent competition. For instance, if The General's Daughter, Eyes Wide Shut or Instinct is playing nearly, chose wisely, because there are many out there that are much better than An Ideal Husband.

The screenplay has been adapted from the Oscar Wilde play relating the tale of five handsome upper class folks of that era when men were still in charge, but women were barely emerging as a force.Sir Robert Chiltern ( Jeremy Northam) and Gertrude, his wife  (Cate Blanchett) are the perfect couple.                           He is a representative in the House of Commons and she the adoring and dutiful spouse. His best friend is the charming perennial bachelor, Lord Arthur Goring, cynically portrayed by Rupert Everett. Sir Robert's charming sister, Mabel (Minnie Driver), has her eye on Arthur.  Into their lives comes the wickedly beautiful Mrs. Laura Chevely (Julianne Moore) with information that may turn their neatly ordered world upside down. She blackmails Sir Robert with some dirt from his distant past.The performances are perfect and the language typically Wilde. Parker even goes so far to introduce Oscar Wilde (Michael Culkin) in a cameo after his play, The Importance of Being Ernest, debuts in London. The costumes and sets are sumptuous. The music (Charlie Mole) is lush. When you leave the theater you have visited with some attractive, intelligent denizens of a bygone era when manners and class were very much what life was all about, but love does slip in bringing the proceedings to a sweet and satisfying denouement.

The studio's name was once synonymous with hipness, freshness, daring; now, it means cut-rate MGM, with high aristocratic gloss and clipped syllables at wholesale prices.This adaptation of Wilde's comic melodrama lacks the Louis B. Mayer high varnish of SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE; it's lush and overstuffed but looks a little tatty and quickly hurled together. Slowish and potboilerish, it details the moral crisis of a self-made MP (Jeremy Northam) agonizing over whether to compromise his principles to avoid the blackmail of his wife's diabolical classmate (Julianne Moore). IDEAL HUSBAND was twice filmed before, but this movie is an object lesson in why it is rarely revived for the stage. The director, Oliver Parker, gasps along from one blockish closeup to another as the exposition sputters out; the film resembles a very early, stagebound talkie. (One moment, when Julianne Moore is seen eavesdropping on a fateful conversation, is like a Gus Van Sant frame-by-frame rendering of a discarded, early George Cukor clinker.)As a hand-wringing wife and her eager-to-be-wed chum, Cate Blanchett and Minnie Driver are the very picture of inauthenticity, but Rupert Everett continues to pose the question why isn't this guy a major movie star? The handsome devil has only to gaze limpidly and emit a few words of dialogue, and the audience melts in a lava-burst of sheer, molten charm. And Julianne Moore continues to tie with Judy Davis for most underused major talent in movies. Earlier this year she was Glenn Close's idjit foil in COOKIE'S FORTUNE; here, she seems to be playing a wry parody of Close. Her sheer presentness is surfeiting; it seems to overflow the tinny, technical requirements of this wicked-grande-dame role, and damn near drowns this gray, clinking movie.

Rupert Everett is superb - made for the part not a stagey Wilde mannered character, but perfectly understated, with langour and apparent carelessness. Cate Blanchett and Minnie Driver are nicely drawn - the one prim and idealistic, the other thoroughly 'modern'; Julianne Moore struggles to give real bite to the evil Mrs Cheevely - she should be of a different world, but somehow it seems accidental rather than intentional. Lavish photography and sets give a real end of the nineteenth century London feel. The film builds well, a little slowly at first but then pushes the tension along with some interesting characterisation. Then at the end it bottles out. Suddenly there's a story to be resolved, characters to be brought into line and it all falls away with some hysterical laughter and a set-piece wedding. Not the right style to finish the film at all.

He is a man of elegant idleness, but he is forced to act when his friend Sir Robert Chiltern (Jeremy Northam) gets caught up in a delicate matter which threatens his rising political career, and marriage to Gertrude (Cate Blanchett).To complicate matters, two women are trying to change Arthur's single status the charmingly persistent Mabel (Minnie Driver), sister of Sir Robert; and the manipulative Mrs Cheveley (Julianne Moore). In amongst this tangled web of lies, temptations and misunderstanding, Arthur Goring must find a way of sorting out not only his friend's lives, but also his own.The reason this film succeeds is mostly due to its base material, a play by Oscar Wilde. Director Oliver Parker has thankfully done little to try and modernise Wilde's work and has thus kept the sparkling dialogue intact and indeed, it is still relevant in today's society. In addition, Parker and Wilde manage to create convincing characters, both male and female, who are beautifully portrayed by the starry cast - all uniformly excellent.The production design is of a very high standard so the film looks good, and the cinematography by David Johnson (who was perhaps the best thing about Hilary and Jackie) is outstanding too.The only flaw to the film is that, for all its charms, it never looks like falling into the bracket of a masterpiece. But, like the character of Arthur Goring, the film realises its limitations.So, to sum up, An Ideal Husband is a delightful film which, whilst not making any serious point, will certainly keep you entertained.

(DVD)","Date":"16 September 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" It's quite a long time that i haven't seen such a perfect movie a highly talented cast, a lavishing setting and a finely chiseled and powerful script.Here, you got an all-star team Driver as the eccentric but romantic young woman (unfortunately a falling star that hasn't shine for a long time), Moore as the Machiavellian lonely woman, Everett as the helpful friend, Sir Robert as the courageous man and ... Blanchet as the lovely wife whom characterization deeply moved me. In my tumultuous life, i was just wondering what's the special gift a woman can offer (me) to fall in love beauty, wit, sensuality, wealth, power? Gertrude has nothing of that but her kindness, her attention, her devotion left me under the spell. She could become easily my ideal wife.Then, the story happens in the Victorian time for which i have also a strong tie. I just really appreciate the British phlegm you can say the more vile things but always with class. Here, you find cupidity, blackmail, lies, ambition but there's nor a fight nor a shout! At last, the script is really well written you don't know if this is a romance, a buddy movie, a thriller or a tragedy. I really like the morals questions the movie asks can a bad action be redeemed? How can a true friend be helpful? Does love live with lies? The answers are not brought in a dull, academic patronizing way but playfully because all the characters seems to orbit around each other! In conclusion, it's a sort of lighter and happier Carlito's way thus a great movie that is maybe really unknown.

He is in Parliament and opposed to an Argentine canal project. Then he is visited by Mrs. Laura Cheveley (Moore) who tries to blackmail him into approving the project. She knows how he gained his wealth and position. If his wife finds out, she'll be devastated. In desperation, he turns to his bachelor friend Lord Arthur Goring (Everett) for help. Goring attempts to help, and for a while, it looks like he made things worse.This witty comedy is given wonderful direction by Oliver Parker, and the production is sumptuous. The actors all underplay, letting the brilliance of the material come through. Especially funny is the scene where everyone is in a different room of Lord Goring's house, with no one aware that the other is present. Most times, you'd see a scene like this with the host a frazzled mess, running around, trying to keep everyone quiet and hidden. Here, Everett never changes his expression and is unflappable, making the situation funnier.Highly recommended as the way a classic play should be filmed.

If you have not seen this version of the play, you would be served well by a viewing.This comedy of manners by Oscar Wilde has been given its just due in the production starring Rupert Everett, Julianne Moore, Cate Blanchett, Minnie Driver, and Jeremy Northam. These actors are excellent in their parts, but Moore and Everett stand out in their roles of the blackmailer with the heart of gold and the shallow ne'er-do-well whose crafty brilliance saves the day.John Wood, who plays Everett's exasperated father, should also be mentioned. One might say that his performance is over the top, but that is exactly what is needed for the part.The film starts slowly, so you must have patience in order to be rewarded. If you are not familiar with the play you might be helped in your appreciation of the film by viewing the featurette included on the DVD. It serves as a worthy preface for the film.It is interesting to note that, about the time this play was being written, Wilde was about to become involved in his trial for being a homosexual the results of which would send him to prison and destroy much of his spirit.How ironic that the social conventions that Wilde so expertly and exquisitely barbed would have such a tragic influence upon his personal life. Enjoy the film as a look at history and as a reminder that social attitudes continue to exert considerable influence upon human behavior.

Each video/film version is good, with different strengths and weaknesses, but of the three I have the biggest problems with this one. First, Rupert Everett plays Lord Goring very low-key, like a man tired of life, which makes the early part of the film slow. Jeremy Brett in the 1969 version (categorized on IMDb under Play of the Month season 4, episode 9) was much better, full of life and wit and energy and imagination. Second, this version, unlike the other two, omits the business with Mrs. Cheveley's broach/ bracelet. I can understand why directors might want to cut it, since it can seem contrived, but cutting it requires coming up with an alternative method by which Goring gets Cheveley to surrender Sir Robert's incriminating letter, and it also costs Goring one of his character-defining lines. In Wilde's original, and in the 1969 and 1998 versions, during the scene between Goring and Cheveley in Goring's rooms, Goring condemns Cheveley most for what he saw as Cheveley's deliberate visit to Lady Chiltern to try to degrade her husband in her eyes, to try and kill her love for him, to put poison in her heart, and bitterness in her soul, and break her idol, and, it may be, spoil her soul. That I cannot forgive you. In the original, and in the other two versions, Cheverley did not in fact go to Lady Chiltern's to do this -- to the contrary, she explains, she went to find her lost broach, and it was Lady Chiltern's insults to Cheveley that caused Cheveley to expose Sir Robert to his wife. That admission clues in Goring that Cheveley was the one who had the broach, and this leads to his trapping her with it and extorting Sir Robert's letter from her. But in this version, Cheveley actually is guilty of going to Lady Chiltern for the purpose of destroying her love for her husband, yet Goring does NOT deliver the crucial denunciation of that act. Instead, Goring kisses and fondles Cheveley in an attempt to get the letter from her, and then engages in a bet whereby he agrees to marry her if Sir Robert supports the Argentine canal scheme. These changes transform Goring from a man who honors marriage to one who treats it as something to be wagered -- making him a fundamentally different character. Furthermore, this version changes the order in which characters enter Goring's apartment during these scenes, also in a way that changes Goring's character. In the original and in the 1969 and 1998 versions, Goring arrives; finds Lady Chiltern's letter that says she is coming; Goring's father shows up unexpectedly; Goring tells his butler a lady is coming who is to be shown into a particular room; Cheveley shows up, butler shows her in; Goring, who never saw her, thinks it is Lady Chiltern; then Sir Robert shows up just as Goring's father is leaving, and Sir Robert forces his way in against Goring's wishes. Thus Goring never intended that Sir Robert and his wife be there at the same time, in different rooms. In this version, by contrast, Sir Robert shows up before the lady, and thus, when Goring tells the butler to put the lady in the other room, he is planning that both Mr. and Mrs. Chiltern will be in his apartment simultaneously, only in different rooms. Thus Goring is taking a terrible risk with her reputation, if Sir Robert discovers her -- as apparently happens. The last major change is that Cheveley sends Sir Robert not only his wife's letter, but also the envelope it came in -- addressed to Goring. Moreover, this version adds a line to the letter -- that her love is destroyed -- which is not in Wilde's original or the other versions. Thus Sir Robert takes it as Cheveley intended, as a love-letter from his apparently unfaithful wife to Goring. Lady Chiltern, Goring, and Mabel then all engage in a series of quick-thinking lies to make Sir Robert think the letter was meant for him. This changes the characters of Goring and Mabel, and not for the better, in order to get a bit of farce into the show. Then, a little later, all three confess their lies to Sir Robert, and he apparently casually forgives and forgets it all. This is neither believable, nor does it show any real insight into human nature or the importance of love, which Wilde's original makes the most important point of the play. The 1998 version with James Wilby (Sir Robert) and Trevyn McDowell (Lady Chiltern) handles this more effectively and with more psychological insight. (The 1969 version avoids the whole issue by ending the play early, with Sir Robert under the impression the letter was meant for him, and with Sir Robert deciding to leave public life).In sum, this version is very entertaining, but it lacks the deeper emotional impact that Wilde's original and the 1998 version sought to attain, and it lacks the sparkling, witty Goring of the 1969 Jeremy Brett version.

Don't leave your mind at the door.Not just a love story, this is more than a romantic comedy, with even aspects of farce. An interplay of sometimes-devious characters, in a historical setting, full of intrigue sufficiently modern to be immediately understood. The plot has enough subtleties to engage and intrigue.The leading character (Goreing) keeps his balance, despite being continually wrong-footed by turns of events. If hereditary peers are that much more able than elected politicians, perhaps the House of Lords had better stay unreformed. Following his plans, actions and emotions as the story unfolds provides enough mental exercise to ensure entertainment, without being too much to hold in the head.I'll accept Goreing is in love with Mabel despite no apparent motivation beyond his father's instructions. (Not that she isn't beautiful!) I'll suspend my disbelief for the geography of the parliamentary scene. (Were all the non-MPs supposed to be in the Strangers' Gallery? Perhaps it was bigger then?) I'll accept Lord Chiltern wore his hat inside the House of Commons. For the sake of the plot I'll happily accept the contrived horseback and open-carriage meetings, and in fact almost anything. The plot is definitely the thing.I like having a puzzle weaved (How will he get out of it? We all know he must!) and then solved by sleight of hand before my very eyes. Reminiscent more of Dornford Yates than of Conan Doyle, this is ideal escapist stuff. No sleaze here the political intrigue is really just for fun.So what was wrong? I don't know, but this didn't quite hit greatness for me. Pretty costumes, good lines, strong actors, a corking plot, but something was missing. I'm not sure what.

And that is how they are marketed.  It seems that no how much the movie is not a comedy or how serious the film is, the execs behind it feel it is necessary to make the film look like it is a comedy.  There are some very serious issues in whatever film it is that they are marketing but instead of trying to market it as a drama or a period piece, they make you think it is a comedy.  They make you think that you are going to walk out with a smile on your face.  In the previews there is always some scene of someone dancing with a huge smile on their face.  It such common practice now that I am surprised that Goodfellas and Schindler's List wasn't marketed as a comedy.  Sorry, that is Scorsese and Spielberg, they actually have morals and values and won't let their films be falsely thought of like that. I say all this because An Ideal Husband really wasn't that funny.  In fact I laughed as much in this as I did in Titanic.  Both were fairly serious films with hints of comedy in them.  But when watching the commercials for An Ideal Husband you are expecting to see a Jim Carrey movie.  And that it wasn't.An Ideal Husband worked for me because I was intrigued by the characters for the most part.  But as the story goes, Robert has been in office in British Parliament for quite some time now.  He is comfortable there and he has a beautiful wife as well.  Suddenly, out of his past comes a mystery lady named Lady Cheveley.  She knows about his tainted past and threatens to expose him unless he supports a bill that is about to be debated upon in the House Of Commons.  She invested a hefty amount of money in some company that will be affected terribly by his speech in the House.  He now has to decide if he is going to do the right thing and stick to his guns or if he is going to acquiesce to the blackmail.The film is funny in some parts, that is for sure.  But the Ideal Husband part of it is really just a sub plot.  There is so much more to this film than women trying to find a suitable husband.  And I wish that was told to us going into the film, perhaps it would be more popular.  I'm not sure.The film is richly acted from all participants and it has some witty dialogue, one of new favourite movie lines now is  No amount of money can buy back a man's past.  Now that is powerful.  What's done is done.  A great line.  But the movie also suffers from people doing things that you know they would not do.  Namely, when life long friend Arthur tries to talk to Robert and explain some of his questionable actions, Robert just walks away and does not even give Arthur a chance to remedy the situation.  When all he had to do was say HEY very loudly,  let me finish dammit.  That would avoid some of the confusion that the friends were encountered with.I did enjoy the film despite my miscomings about it.  Cate Blanchet is a joy to watch.  She lights up the screen.  But on a whole I was disappointed in some areas and it kept me from really enjoying it immensely.  But ya know what?  I'm in my late 20's.  The crowd I saw it with was at least two generations older than me and they loved it.  They even cheered at the end of the film.  So maybe it is a film that is enjoyed better by someone that is not so caught up in the broohaha.  Maybe this is a film to just be enjoyed and that means just sitting in the theater with your detectors off. Just enjoy.  I guess that should be advice to myself.

The people arguing with me made very good cases for Arthur Miller, etc., but I pointed out that there were lots of playwrites in the Victorian era, for that was their highest form of entertainment.  Yet whose plays are regularly performed -- and, if performed well, fresh?  Only Oscar Wilde's, the light-comedy writer.  A nod is given in An Ideal Husband to Wilde's masterpiece, The Importance of Being Earnest, and there's even a brief appearance by Wilde himself, a self-indulgent man whose most selfish act was to destroy himself so that we couldn't get more polished and shining plays from him.  All the fripperies of Wilde's ostentatious Victorian era are on view in An Ideal Husband.  The acting is uniformly good.  The production values are first-rate.  What's missing, oddly enough, is Wilde.  Now, this is understandable -- An Ideal Husband is bad enough for our era is that it's a movie you have to think about and give undivided attention to know what's going on. To have left all of Wilde intact -- for Wilde's plays are really cleverly machined plots hidden in a thin veneer of epigrams -- would have been impossible, given modern attention-spans.  A lot of the chatter of Wilde's characters has been cut, and some lines were added.  Still, this helps make the plot  more lucid.  The problem is, there is perhaps too much focus on the tragic elements of the plot;  and rather than playing them as dark comedy, they are played very seriously indeed;  and then there will be a sudden spurt of Wildean comedy.  The acting is uniformly good.  Veterans like Peter Vaughn and John Wood seem vastly more aware of what they're playing, and it would have been nice to see more old hands from the English theatre, who know exactly what they're doing, on hand.  The young actors, while turning in very fine performances, vary tremendously in their approach to the material and their success.  Only Rupert Everett comes across as thoroughly Wildean.  Every time there's a sag in the play, the makers have sense enough to trot Everett out, and suddenly all is well.  Everett is handed a plum role, the character Wilde possibly identified with -- in Dorian Gray it would be Lord Henry;  in Earnest, Algernon Moncrieff;  here, it is Lord Goring.  And Everett wears the role with a properly flippant seriousness, coming across as truly Wildean.  Occasionally, he appears determined to single-handedly keeping the whole show from sliding into George Gissing territory.  If an MVP award was given for movies, Everett would be on the short list for 1999. The faults that cause Ideal Husband ultimately tofall short of its intention -- to bring Wilde to a modern audience -- is not the production people or the actors, but whoever decided that Wilde's words should be presented (truncated and rearranged though they were) without Wilde's spirit.  Wilde's life was a tragedy, for he was a hero with tremendous tragic flaws that devoured him;  but his plays were funny.  To understand The Importance of being Wile is not to examine him in the Victorian era;  we all find it easy to make fun of Victorian conventions these days, and its code was far different from our's.  To think of Wilde properly we should see a comparable figure today poking public fun at our modern American conventional morality, making comic plays at the expense of practitioners of political correctness, multiculturalism, and other modern sacred cows that will look as bizarre a hundred years from now as the Victorians look to us.  Only, the p.c. crowd can't laugh at themselves the way the Victorians could, and a modern Wilde would be destroyed and fed to the vultures a more quickly.  Perhaps the tragedy was accented to underscore the importance of a proper character in those days;  but it makes the comedy, when it bursts out, more uncertain.  The most important lingering effect An Ideal Husband leaves is a wistful nostalgia for the days when people were willing to risk their lives or public reputations -- or their offices -- to do what's right. Perhaps the best reason to see this Ideal Husband is not to see how silly the Victorians could be (how we need a modern Wilde to hold up a mirror to our own silliness!) but to be reminded of Something that is singularly missing today, not only in politics, but in the arts, where no Wilde is willing to puncture the pompous mores of our culture;  Something that can be more important to a person than a position or popularity or success;  Something that should be revived for a new century and not just redefined by the cultural elites to suit what they are rather than to define who they are by its proper definition  that Something is integrity.  And despite An Ideal Husband's flaws, and also in spite of its character's gleeful underhandedness, the movie is ultimately a long-overdue celebration of Integrity.

The secret threatens to expose Lord Goring's friend Sir Robert (Jeremy Northham) and his wife (Cate Blanchett). Set in 1894 London, and adapted from the stage play by Oscar Wilde, `Husband' is the latest costume drama where `scandal' and `society' are the buzzwords and tedium is the audience's reaction. Oliver Parker directed the 1995 Shakespeare flick `Othello' with a burning pace and a slick cast led by Laurence Fishburne.  That film was deeply entertaining and showed that Parker was capable of making the most mundane work seem fresh again. With `Husband', Parker seems to have forgotten this gift.  Relying on the lame drama, the film utterly fails whenever the actors get serious.  These costume films are just all the same.  The plots seem to bleed into each other, the actors all give the identical interpretations.  I could easily predict how the score would sound, the lighting arranged, and each actor's enunciation.  I am losing my patience for this genre (the recent mega-disappointment `The Winslow Boy') and I pray this well has run dry. I am so used to Rupert Everett's 3 week old kitten purr of a voice,  I immediately thought he was all wrong for the part of a dashing leading man.  Rupert is a very handsome guy, but his acting up to this film has left a lot to be desired. In `Husband', it takes time, but he soon becomes the film's saving grace.  It's a funny performance stuffed with cynicism and wit.  Julianne Moore equals Everett with style and venom. She's in the middle of a real career defining period(`Boogie Nights', `Cookie's Fortune'), and this film adds to the list of smashing performances.  Minnie Driver and Cate Blanchett bring up the rear of actors here.  Ms. Driver looks just about as animated as I've seen her, and Ms. Blanchett looks lovely beyond words.  Both are given very little to do, thus a huge waste of talent occurs.  That is tough to watch. `Ideal Husband' isn't my idea of a good time.  The seniors in the audience that I watched it with disagreed.  I feel very open minded to most intelligent films, I mean, come on, I'm never picky.

This movie, screenplay written based upon Mr. Wildes original work, is quintessentially English in every way, much like Downton Abbey of today's popularity. In fact it takes place in an earlier era, perhaps early 19th century, prior to electricity and horseless carriages, in a time when the English language used in discourse was employed in the highest articulation and most delicate insinuation, respectful of integrity, honor, and sensibility in personal interchanges, but fully pregnant with subtlety, deeper hidden meanings, and wileful if not guileful, wit. The story is not complex, but it is artfully constructed and beautifully played out by the highest quality acting that I have seen in a very long time. Rupert Everett, Cate Blanchett, Julianne Moore, Minnie Driver, John Wood, and even Peter Vaughn (as the butler) all contribute subtle but effective, and memorable performances in this wonderland of high British society. The comedic timing, the perfectly phrased and delivered lines all add to the impeccable artistry achieved in this film. The sets deliver the essence of sumptuously wealthy English domiciles imaginable, and rarely is a bare hand visible, as the ladies and gentlemen find the wearing of white gloves fashionable in the day. Ultimately, it is a story about love, affections, honor, human imperfection, friendship, wealthy aspirations and the ending of a bachelorhood, all woven together into a cloth of varying textures in a kaleidoscope of color, using the finest quality of threads (acting). This is simply a very lovely, very enjoyable, witty and visually stunning tale in a time long since left behind, that I found highly stimulating and fun to fall into for a while.

I haven't seen the 1947 movie of An Ideal Husband, but I did see the 1969 BBC production with Jeremy Brett. I can't imagine any production of this witty, clever and satirical story not being highly entertaining. At the same time, I can't think that any future version will top this 1999 film. The story spectacle is excellent &#x96; along the lines of the big splashy movies of Victorian England. All the technical and production values are first-rate. But it is the directing and acting that stand out most. It is in the dialog, with facial expressions, gestures and moves that one best appreciates Wilde. It is from the people that the author wrings out the great comedy and satire &#x96; amidst drama at times, and romance and suspense.This film has a substantial cast of wonderful actors. Every role is exquisitely played to perfection &#x96; um, make that NEAR-perfection. But Rupert Everett's Lord Goring is something else. To imitate a quip in the play penned by the witty Wilde, Everett's Goring is only slightly less than perfect. It's hard to imagine this egocentric, ego-maniacal character any funnier than in this film.A bonus featurette with my DVD intimates that An Ideal Husband is also a drama. I'll concede to the dramatic moments and undertone. But the comedy thread provided by Lord Goring throughout never lets those elements of drama take hold or last longer than to set up the next pun or witty line. This movie is a wonderful feast of quips, subtleties, face-offs and dismissals. It pokes fun at different aspects of society &#x96; the rich and idle, the wealthy and powerful, the prim and proper, the cunning and conniving, the perfect and the imperfect. It has messages and delivers them with good humor and subtlety. This 1999 version of An Ideal Husband is Oscar Wilde at his best. I highly recommend this film. It's suitable for the whole family &#x96; that opening scene with the blurred background passes quickly. But the young folks may not readily catch or enjoy the humor. The following are some lines of dialog to whet your appetite for watching An Ideal Husband.Lord Goring You see, Phipps, fashion is what one wears oneself. What is unfashionable is what other people wear.Other people are quite dreadful. The only possible society is oneself.To love one's self is the beginning of a lifelong romance.I enjoy talking about nothing, father. It's the only thing I know anything about.Lady Chiltern In the old days, we had the rack. Nowadays, we have the press.Mabel Chiltern Do you have anything you wish to say to me, Lord goring? Goring Um .. No, I don't think so. Mabel Chiltern Then I don't want to hear it.Lord Caversham Do you always understand what you say, sir? Lord Goring Yes! If I listen attentively.Mrs. Chevely And so, my dear Arthur, are you not just a little bit pleased to see me? Lord Goring Oh, my dear woman, possibly even less than that.Lord Goring Did you miss me? Mabel Chiltern Awfully! Lord Goring Then I'm sorry I did not stay away later. I like being missed.Lord Goring Yes, but the fact is, father, this is not my day for talking seriously.

I'm quite aware of my personal inclination over the glittering cast (a combo with British, American and Australian) may overweigh the intricate screenplay and laudable wisecracks, which turns out to be that it can effortlessly appease my expectations. As I haven't read the original book, I assume it's Wilde himself who should take most of the credit. On the other hand, the dexterity of Mr. Parker's talent should not be overlooked. The satirical overtone of the British milieu is undeniably gratifying judging by the taste of a foreign audience, all the twists thoroughly converge into the pyramidical outburst and unleashes a feel-good sensibility which is smooth but hasty, running at a length of a meagre 97 minute, the sparks is penny-pinching.One sure thing is that the competent cast manipulates a wonderful rendition against the sketchy arrangement, the first time of two of my goddess Moore and Blanchett star in the same film (a second time is a sadly under-appreciated THE SHIPPING NEWS 2001, in which they are two parallel lines), the magnificent good Vs. evil collision alone worths the ticket, Moore unstoppably exudes her elegant malignancies in each frame, dominates the entire picture under her grip despite of her not-so-packed screen time. And Blanchett, on the contrary, hides her lioness prowess and accomplishes an easier job as the forthrightly guileless Lady Gerturde Chiltern. Another victory comes from Lord Arthur Goring, who is winningly played by a chiseled Rupert Everett, he is utterly suitable. But Jeremy Northam and Minnie Driver's roles are tedious and uncanny respectively, forgive my taste and frankness, the latter falls short of appeal from any respect in my humble opinion. I give the film an 8/10, a little bit overrated I must say, but I could not resist the pure charisma from the dynamic verbal battles, especially in a language which I am able to understand.

Rupert Everett plays the target of Ms. Moore's intrigue; only one actor could have played the role better George Sanders. What makes this movie even more entertaining is that the Moore/Everett characters mirror one another as each one tries to outdo the other's cynicism, with amusing results. All kinds of embarrassing moments occur as miscommunication leads to havoc which one hopes will be sorted out.

Much of the appeal of a first viewing comes from watching a perfectly cast Rupert Everett traipse through Oscar Wilde effortlessly. Ensuing viewings reveal that both Blanchett and Northam assay their characters quite finely also; although their scenes together are really almost too much to bear without rolling ones eyes (Love me Gertrude! Love me! Hold me Robert..!). Blanchett, although plain, becomes increasingly beautiful as she inhabits Victorian trappings and mores, while trying to hold it all together. As she strives to accommodate all sorts of conflict she grows more and more winsome. The narrative lets her and Robert off the hook. In a bit of ethical dissonance, we're meant to feel that gluing the two back together (in upper class splendor) is more important than reckoning with the loathsome, traitorous source of Robert's wealth, and Gertrude's social standing. They're quite a pair of hypocrites. Ah well, it's the convention of light comedy to share their delusion, and devalue such things.Well past the resolution of the major conflict, the movie lingers over some glorious, goofy moments in the Chiltern mansion. You may wonder why the movie stays so long, but the scenes are there to resolve a secondary plot line. They're droll and underplayed wonderfully. Just about every scene of Minnie Driver and Rupert Everett bantering is a gem; with some subtle face work and reactions. This coda is also shot & pieced together nicely, with even the camera placement being thoughtful and funny (A vain Minnie Driver steams past the camera to await a proposal behind a palm tree. Everett and his disapproving father depart the screen symmetrically off either side. heh he he.. good stuff.) Whenever I think I bought this movie in a moment of weakness, I pop it in and it always makes me laugh out loud.

She is very much in love with her husband, Robert (Jeremy Northam), a rising star in the British Parliament. Yet, an old schoolmate of Gertrude's, the conniving Laura (Julianne Moore) arrives back in town with a mission. She knows a secret about Robert that would bring about his ruin and decides to pressure him to support a government bill that would invest heavily in a Argentine adventure, one she has staked her money on as well. What can Robert do? He turns to a close friend, Lord Arthur (Rupert Everett) for help. Arthur, a rich and witty bachelor, offers what support he can. But, with women chasing him around every corner, including Robert's sister, Mabel (Minnie Driver), can Arthur devote the time required to saving his friend? And, will Gertrude have to be told about the blackmailing, causing her to lose some faith in the husband she thinks is ideal? This film, based on a play by Oscar Wilde, is a sophisticated and charming movie of the highest order. As such, it is replete with clever and mirthful lines, lovely costumes, beautiful sets, and memorable characters. As the principal actors, Blanchett, Northam, Everett, Driver, and Moore are excellence itself, laying doubt that anyone else could have filled their roles in a better manner. Yes, it is a dialogue-driven film but it is never stuffy or boring. If you have enjoyed such movies as Emma or A Merry War, this one is an ideal choice for your next film engagement.

Fortunately for Sir Noel he lived in a slightly more tolerant age and ended up a British Institution,whereas the unfortunate Oscar ended up in a British Institution. Sometimes a talent to amuse just isn't enough. Mr Wilde was what was known in less enlightened times as a Raging Queen,and when he seduced the pretty son of a peer of the realm,the thin veneer of tolerance that surrounded his circle was strained to breaking point.Referred to publicly as a somdomite(sic) by the peer,Wilde, against the advice of his friends,sued in a moment of arrogance he was to live to regret. He is widely regarded as a martyr to Victorian hypocrisy and his posthumous reputation has grown with the acceptance of sexual diversity and now stands at its peak.Future literary critics may take a more cold -eyed view of this minor Victorian playwright with a penchant for borrowing other people's one-liners.Forty years ago Wilde stood a long way behind his near contemporary and fellow Irishman George Bernard Shaw a man of infinitely more depth,versatility and intellectual acuity. Today's sound-byte society is far more comfortable with Wilde's instantly accessible cellophane-wrapped drawing room jokiness. This reached its apotheosis in An ideal husband,which,along with Lady Windermere's fan and The importance of being earnest is surely in production somewhere in the world 24/7 - if not it certainly seems like it. So to the latest movie version,and the first question you have to ask yourself is why?I suppose it's rather like asking why Liz Taylor buys so much jewellery.....because she can.She doesn't need any more diamonds and the world doesn't need another An ideal husband,so go figure. It's not that the film's bad,it's just ....well...unnecessary really. No new ground is broken,none of the performances are more than party-pieces,the costumes are nice,you almost feel there should be a little notice Cigarettes by de Reszke down amongst the wines and spirits........ It's all very clever and highly polished,rather like the characters in the play itself,but just a tad shallow.In Shaw's work the characters speak their own words,Wilde's creations merely parrot his epigrams. With Wilde's star still in the ascendancy perhaps a re-assessment of GBS is overdue,I suggest a prestige production of Mrs Warren's profession might be more of a challenge for Mesdames Blanchett and co. instead of sleep-walking through overfamiliar fare.

The plots are always artificial. The knock on An Ideal Husband has always been that it is not as funny as some of the other plays and that it is overly dependent on romantic love, not a characteristic Wildean pose. Nevertheless, as a film, this may be the best realized of Wilde's plays. The cast is top drawer, including not only the principals (Jeremy Northam, Cate Blanchette, Rupert Everett, Minnie Driver and Julianne Moore as the play's beautiful villainness) but also the wonderful John Wood as the father of Everett's character. Wood isn't especially well known for his movie roles but he is one of the great English stage actors and he steals every scene he's in -- against rather stiff competition. Among the lead actors, Everett and Moore are especially good but they also have the best material to work with. Go see The Importance of Being Earnest, of course, and Lady Windermere's Fan, which are superior dramas. But I don't think they've been done on film as well as this one has.

This is a movie in which one has to pay attention and listen constantly, and many people of my generation sadly seem unable to do this.  I really think that it's a shame because this is a well acted funny movie.To those who are unfamiliar with Wilde, I would recommend picking up one of his plays and reading a couple pages (preferably the entire thing) to get a feel for the pace and style of the movie as it is definitely not something everyone will enjoy.  However, anyone who remotely enjoys Wilde will surely at least be entertained by the film.  The dialogue and plot remain surprisingly fresh after a century or so.  Rupert Everett is wonderful as the typical Wildean dandy, and although Minnie Driver is a bit blunt in her performance in comparison with the others, she's just so adorable only the harshest critic will moan about bad casting.  I laughed out loud in the scene when she falls in love with Lord Goring.  The setting and costumes are very bright and cheerful in fitting with the mood of the play, as is the music.  One can nitpick about authenticity of costumes and camera shots and the ethnicity of the music, but I've always viewed Wilde's plays as sort of witty soap operas with rather shallow moral lessons.  His novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, is a little deeper.  Thus, I think a profound treatment of the plays would be kind of inappropriate.  English majors will be quick to disagree. The only scene in the movie which seemed a bit tacky was the play during which the characters were watching a performance of The Importance of Being Earnest, and Wilde himself makes a cameo.

The film opens out the play and includes a few in-jokes for Wilde fans and it is effective in making for a slick product even if it takes the edge of the actual characters.The witty dialogue is good and it won't disappoint fans of the play.  The direction uses the locations and sets really well, giving the film a sense of period that it really needs.  I am a reverse snob (I know I shouldn't be!) and the spoilt romances of the well educated and privileged upper classes is of no interest to me - but in this setting it works!The cast is impressively heavy weight but the honours are stolen by two main actors.  Everett was born for this sort of whimsy and he does it exceedingly well, making his character playful and fun.  Driver is also great as his love interest and her scenes with Everett are the best of the film.  The rest of the cast are all excellent even if they don't have quite as much fun as these two.  Moore does well while Blanchett and Northam are both good despite not having a fair share of the wit.  Wood and Vaughan both have small roles but get laughs every time!Overall this is a sparky little movie that will appeal to those who love the cut and thrust of well written, witty dialogue and playful to's and fro's between the characters.  I need say no more - the audience for this film already know who they are and vice versa.

The story revolves around political figure Sir Robert Chiltern (Enigma's Jeremy Northam) and his charming friend Lord Arthur Goring (Golden Globe nominated Rupert Everett). Chiltern's life with brilliant wife Lady Gertrude (Cate Blanchett) and support from sister Mabel (Minnie Driver) is perfect. But his and Arthur's lives are turned upside down by the arrival of old acquaintance Mrs. Laura Cheveley (Golden Globe nominated Julianne Moore) with blackmail in mind. It is an incriminating letter that Laura has to ruin the men's lives. Also starring John Wood as Lord Caversham, Lindsay Duncan as Lady Markby, Peter Vaughan as Phipps and The Living Daylights' Jeroen Krabbé as Baron Arnheim. The performances are good, and the visual part is good too, I admit I didn't pay full attention, maybe if I did I would rate it higher, but never mind. It was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Costume Design, Best Make Up/Hair and Best Adapted Screenplay. Good!

I just know he was an Irish born playwrite , was a master at the bitchy putdown and was imprisoned for homosexual activity which left me with the impression I was going to be watching a movie featuring a married man who is cheating on his loving trusting wife with another manThis isn`t the actual plot to AN IDEAL HUSBAND , but I could see a sort of hatred towards women . This of course isn`t a uniquely homosexual thing ( Consider the lyrics of hetrosexual song writers like Matt Johnson and Roger Waters for example ) but the women in this story seem to be portrayed as being a barrier towards men finding happiness with the idea that once a man marries he can kiss goodbye to carefree times . I`m actually having a problem believing that Wilde was ever gay since he sums up the male/female relationship perfectlyAs for the cast the non English actors do put on convincing English accents though the performances are a little stagey while the directing is rather flat and isn`t helped by the fact there`s several long fades to black between scenes giving this cinematic movie a made for television feel  "}]
