[{"Title":"Another masterpiece from Kitano","Date":"29 June 2002","Score":"36 out of 48 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  Takeshi Kitano's Brother is Kitano's masterpiece among his other films. I really haven't seen bad film from him. Brother is set in America as Kitano's character travels to US from Japan, and starts new life there. He has his half brother living there so he has a place to live in. Soon he starts to have new friends and become a leader and member of their new gang/yakuza. Violent confrontations with other gangs and mafia take place as everyone is willing to use violence and vengeance in order to settle things.Brother has all the usual and breath taking Kitano elements we've learnt to see. The flashbacks of events, long shots without editing, character's faces that say more things than 100 words, images of beauty and peace and wry humor, among others elements. The main theme in Brother is loyalty and friendship that becomes even love. The last scene is fantastic and very unusual for Kitano; never has he underlined his message this clearly as he does in Brother's finale. It is so purifying scene and really makes the point clear, but still, most people don't understand anything about Kitano's films, because they are so personal and different compared to Western mainstream films.Brother is like a combination of Violent Cop and Hana'Bi. It has Violent Cop's bleakness and Hana-Bi's beauty and sadness. Brother is very sad film at times, and only last scene gives something really positive and also optimistic. Hana-Bi is very sad and beautiful film, and these two, Brother and Hana-Bi, have much in common. Both were composed by the same guy, Joe Hisaishi, who did fantastic job especially in Hana-Bi and also Sonatine. Violent Cop is very gritty and also pessimistic film, and is very similar to Brother in its overall look of life. Both films are also very calm and restrained and not as visually stunning as Hana-Bi and Sonatine. All these films are masterpieces of Japanese cinema, and it is interesting to see how Kitano mixes elements from his other films and creates always something new and immortal. The violence is very brutal and challenging but definitely not gratuitous or exploitative. Kitano's violence is always very symbolic and sudden, and not necessarily realistic. These films analyze many aspects of violence as a tool of communicating for weak souls. Kitano definitely doesn't justify violence or praise it; he just shows what most people or film makers probably wouldn't even dare to think of, and once the viewer may be thinking yeah, kill that b****rd! the film turns against the viewer and makes him think what he just said and accepted. The more emotionally challenging film is, the more noteworthy it becomes and Kitano's films are perfect examples of that. Brother is also occasionally filled with Kitano's wry and personal humor which was at its taunting in his Boiling Point. Brother has many great personal touches of its creator and every time Kitano's character laughs here, there is something very twisted in his mind and going on. Brother is not thoroughly cynical film after all, and these humoristic touches only add to the great purification of the last scene. The film criticizes yakuza also pretty much and with the director's personal style, as there are numerous scenes involving yakuza rites and codes of honor. Also, there is a great scene involving basketball and yakuza member's attempt to get the ball and be king of the game and have a feeling of being somebody. Boiling Point has plenty of these scenes and tones as the gangsters play tough guy with big guns and thus try to get acceptance. These films really should make yakuzas ask themselves, why?I am totally stunned by cinematic styles Kitano uses in his films. The editing and photography is so incredibly smooth and stylish, and creates the atmosphere of the film. The faces are among the most important details in Kitano's films as there are so many things to be read from characters' faces. For example, there is awesome scene in Brother's beginning where Kitano sees the death of a yakuza boss. Kitano has totally unique sense of beauty, sensitivity and expressing emotions that has no comparison from other films. His character doesn't talk too much in his films, but anytime he says something, he says and expresses more than thousand words. His films are immortal and can be seen over and over again, and still they have plenty of things to offer for the lover of this unique cinema.Brother is among Kitano's greatest films and I definitely give this ten out of ten, because there are absolutely no negative aspects in this film, and this proudly stands in Takeshi Kitano's filmography.

When it was finally released the film played mainly in Art houses and was heavily edited by the old cronies that sit on the M.P.A.A. board.

Although, I'm was a little bit iffy because of the fact that Omar Epps was in it, and I was worried that it would be some piece of americanized garbage. But when I watched it,I was completely blown away. It was intelligent without being terribly confusing, and it was violent without being overly gross. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen, and is quite possibly one of the greatest films ever made. The story concerns Aniki Yamomoto (Takeshi kitano, under the name Beat Takeshi) who joins a very well-to-do yakuza family in japan. But when a price is put on his head, he flees to America, to set up shop there with his younger brother Ken (kuroudo Maki under the name Claude Maki) and his gang, which includes a black man named Denny (Omar Epps). They run into trouble with other mobs in the city, but Aniki's style of war brings them on a steady inclination to the top. Underrated and under-appreciated, this little gem is definitely a good one to own, as it is truly a cinematic masterpiece.

I'm not entirely sure why. I think mostly it was just plain fun. 'Beat' Takeshi was just brilliant in the role of Aniki. It's a sign of a great actor when he can command your attention without really doing anything.I loved its thoughtful pace and purpose, and how there was a real symmetry in the story. In terms of introduction of the characters and their interactions, the story closes in reverse really nicely. I won't say much more, as I don't want to spoil it; it's not major, just nicely done.All in all, I highly recommend it. It's quite violent at times, but if you're okay with that (and hell, perhaps even like it in a Kill Bill kind of way) then definitely check this out.

It has most of the characteristics of the other films - the sudden, shocking violence, the impassive silences, the same supporting actors, the obligatory seaside scene. But the shift to an American location weakens it, despite the excellent contributions of the US actors, especially Omar Epps.But the core, unmissable qualities of a Kitano film remain. Takeshi Kitano must be the natural successor to Clint Eastwood as an anti-hero. Most of the stylised violence takes place off-screen, with a flash of humour, then the after-effects vividly on display. The sound-track from Joe Hisaishi matches the screen action perfectly, at times an aggressive supplement to the violence, at other times hauntingly peaceful.The ending is the film's weakest part, as though Kitano pandered to imagined (or real) American requirements. The out-of-town setting and road movie elements fit uncomfortably with the rest of the film. But if this is the compromise needed to get Kitano to make more films out of Japan, it must be worthwhile.

However, if you like heavy gunfight violence in the style of Reservoir Dogs or Takeshi´s elder Violent Cop this is the right film for you! The body count is higher than in all Quentin Tarantino/Sam Peckinpah films together and even some gore like cut off fingers and heads is brought on here and there. Once more the violent pictures are laid under with beautiful piano music what gives some disturbing aspects as well as emotional rollercoasters to this film. Definitely one of the better gangster movies of the last few years, but not the best as often said. A good film which is a little bit overrated...

Brother is his first overseas production, and to this day his only one, and perhaps its minimal success and marginal fan base is due to its seeming lack of plot, its evasive editing, or something else that Takeshi customarily draws attention to, whether purposefully or not.Brother is not quite his best film, but you will realize that the focus is not on the story but on the themes of its story. Completely unlike its characters, especially Takeshi's stone cold killer, its story is something to feel your way through. These characters do not feel much. They do. The movie is mostly made up of deadpan scenes of bloody violence, occasional dialogue, and quiet medium closeups. The music, which like in all Takeshi films is lush and emotional, directs our feelings.Brother is great for fans of crime movies, gangsters, violence overall, Asian cinema, and even action fans, but Takeshi Kitano's style is a strangely deadpan and very personal approach. It's an acquired taste.

Kitano is definitely glorifying gratuitous violence, I am sorry to say it but it's true. He's smart and chic enough to know that he could be making wonderfully poetic films for the artsy crowd but perhaps he wants to offend on purpose. However, he ends up making beautifully directed odes to brutality in which japanese contemporary society appears only as backdrop against the vicious and callous homicidal maniacs obssessed with serial killing. Here, Kitano ,expatriated in LA, quickly manages to practically wipe off entire Cholo (Chicano) mob population dozens of bodies mowed left and right with an aide from three inept street hustlers (one of whom is his americanized half-brother)... Of course, Brother does have Kitano's trademark scenes even if not nearly as elaborate as those in Sonatine or Fireworks a brief long-shot scene at the beach and a GREAT roof scene with the paper airplane...LOOK, OF COURSE, FOR SOME CHOPPED FINGERS ETC.I am perhaps rambling a little. It shows you how ambivalent my feelings about Kitano in fact are. On one hand I like him a lot and consider him a rarely gifted film maker. In fact, one of the finest. On the other hand I deeply deplore his basic premises death and misogyny. I can't make up my mind. I keep wanting to stay away from his films and I end up seeing them one after another. A strange experience for me.

Brother of 2001 is in my opinion Kitano's weakest film up to date, which does not mean that it's bad. It is just not quite as brilliant as Kitano's other work. Kitano is once again director and leading actor, and he once again delivers a great performance in the lead. Yakuza Aniki Yamamoto (Kitano) flees to America after his death is ordered by a Yakuza clan. Yamamoto goes to LA where his younger brother Ken is supposed to study. Instead of studying, however, Ken deals drugs with some American friends. And it doesn't take Yamamoto long to plan some drastic improvements for his little brother's gang...Takeshi Kitano's performance is once again superb, this guy certainly is one of the greatest cinematic multi-talents who ever lived. I found the Japanese characters great in general, and if it was only for them, Brother would have probably almost reached Kitano's masterpieces in brilliance. I personally didn't like the American characters though. Omar Epps certainly is a good actor, but his character of Denny is just not very deep, simply the very stereotypical African American street gangster seen in two out of three cheesy Hollywood blockbusters. And that counts for the other American characters too. It wasn't actually that bad with Omare Epps, simply because he is a very good actor. Besides the flatness of the American characters, I found the movie very good. It is once again beautifully and imaginatively filmed in typical Kitano style, and it has the typical Kitano humor that I love. The movie is also very violent, so it's probably not for people who are easily offended by brutality in films. What I also really like about Brother is the fact that at least half of the movie is in Japanese. The Japanese characters also talk Japanese when they are in the US.Brother is arguably Kitano's weakest movie, and definitely my least favorite of his movies, but that doesn't mean it's bad. We're talking about a great cinematic genius here, and Brother certainly is a good, suspenseful, entertaining, stylish and interesting film. In case you don't know Kitano yet, i recommend to watch Hana-bi or Violent Cop before watching this, but in case you're already familiar with Kitano Brother is certainly worth watching.

He has flatly refused to make a film outside the confines of Japan ever since.Takeshi started his career as a TV variety show host and comedian before trading his mic for pistols. Having gone the gangster route, crime film fans around the world have rejoiced ever since. For those of us that grew up in Asia though that transition was something of a shock. Think Regis and Kathy Lee doing Godfather IV. Weird right?This film opens up in Japan, deep within Yakuza held territory. Takeshi plays a character called Aniki, the right hand man of his Yakuza master, whose every whim must be satisfied at all times. Underlings scurry about opening doors, lighting cigarettes, procuring young Women. After foiling an assassination plot, his boss is killed anyway and for his dishonor, Aniki is ordered to flee to America until the heat dissipates.Humiliated, he strides around the mean streets of Los Angeles' underworld something worse than a marked man - he is now a masterless Ronin, without honor. This may not be true, but I like to think that his character abounds in Samurai lore. His behavior is of a man that is already philosophically dead in much the same way that the noble Samurai's code of Bushido extols that a true warrior must always think of himself as already dead, thus there is no fear in the face of one's enemy. Kitano's dead eyed greeting toward an unfamiliar modern world is stunning in it's simplicity and underpins what I just wrote.There is the usual fish out of water language confusion. He over tips the cab driver and gets abused by some racist American slob - The asshole doesn't even speak English!He finds his younger brother (not his real brother - they were both adopted), but rather a young man he also calls Aniki which we soon realize is not his actual name, but a cool word meaning brother in Japanese. The two of them call each other that. Nice touch.Anyway Aniki gets angry when he finds out that his younger brother has quit school and his job, in order to sell drugs with some Black and Hispanic hoodlums. Aniki quickly asserts his authority by single handedly slaughtering the local drug dealers who have been bullying the young hoodlums he just met, thus impressing them no end into happily accepting his tutelage in the world of strong arm extortion and drugs.So begins Aniki's rise to power, eventually stepping on some very powerful toes - namely the Italian American Mafia. A war ensues, throttling this excellent crime film towards it's cataclysmic and bloody finale.

I think that the films characters are developed slowly, but realistically, if their personalities were too blatant then it would have spoilt the slow nature of the film.I think the film has many Tarantino-esquire parts. For example their is a shot similar to the one in Pulp Fiction with the hit men at the door were the camera pans instead of tracking. Also the violence was very similar, for example instead of going for the John Woo style acrobatic action, the violence is cold and harsh, making it impact more on me as a viewer, I think that's why John Woo's films travel better in western cinema that Kitano's work.I thought the acting was very good, but the black members of the gang were perhaps a little stereotypical. To many who are not used to Kitano's style of film making the film may be very confusing, as it jumps forward in time and has scenes, that on first viewing seem pointless. But what they may not realise, is that Kitano is actually representing time passes, as the Yakuza develop and the events e.g. the party at Denny's mother's house are just things that happen along the way.

I'm not too sure really where I should start on this film, but what I found so startling and enthralling (apart from the extreme violence) was the way in which each character, expecially those of Aniki (Takeshi) and Denny (Epps), was depicted; Aniki as fiercely loyal and occasionally psychotic, yet mostly restrained, quiet and polite, with an engaging sense of humour, and Denny, who embodies a certain kind of innocense and honesty, as well as oppenness and trust, which allows the friendship between he and Aniki to develop. The performance of Omar Epps as Denny is really excellent, especially during the final scene of the movie, where we really feel the extent to which these two characters have bonded, even though they barely speak the same language or share any cultural similarities. However, the top honours must surely go to Kitano. With his portrayal of Aniki, he brings this element of unpredictability to the film one minute Aniki is just the seemingly mild-mannered, man of few words, the next, he explodes with ferious violence. His stellar direction also embodies a certain unpredictable quality, and I was impressed by the seemingly effortless way in which he transferred between the painfully violent action sequences with the beautifully staged sequences of friendship between Denny and Aniki, handling each scene with care and sensitivity. Just so I don't keep on rambling, I'll finish off now. But there's so much more one could say about this film. Especially about the final scene, which is a real stunner.

Some people will be puzzled by the dumbing down of Kitano's usual lofty intellectualism, insight and subtlety enjoyed in his aforementioned flicks.What needs to be remembered here, is that this was Kitano's *first*, feet-first foray into the North American movie market, and given the great divides between Asian culture and that of N. American, compromises had to be made so that an audience of people, many who may have never been exposed to the traditionalized violence of the Yakuza culture, can catch on and not be left in the dust.I'm sorry, but I can't understand the constant harping people in the comments area are making regarding constant violence.... Kitano's charachter gives a reaction for each action given to him... he gets ganked about Denny's ruined wine, he reacts, he is kidnappped, he reacts... For all intents and purposes, you will notice that Yamamoto (Kitano) is actually a very quiet charachter, he becomes the pivotal point around which action happens (not necessarilly instigating the action himself) and when he *does* have to act, it is swift, clean and without hesitation... A flurry of activity, before he is still again, very much like his past works in Japan.One must also stop and notice the little details in Brother... One notices that when Yamamoto first finds his little brother, he is living in sub-modest digs and wearing the street clothes of the day... As the movie progresses, you see a marked scaling up... Armani suits, a new loft office as opposed to the ground level concrete apartment. This, of course, takes time in real life, but in Brother, you are taken along for the whirlwind ride to the top of the gangster food chain and it's lofty heights... It *seems* to happen overnight, and as with all things that seem to happen overnight, things can spiral out of control quickly. This is very evident with the metioric rise of the American Yakuza in Brother, and the watcher feels iand becomes part of it.*POSSIBLE SPOILER*Towards the end of the film, Yamamoto's little brother goes back to the office and sees a group of dead bodies therein... If one looks at the bodies as they are laid out, the form the Japanese kanji charachter for death. This is part of Kitano's finding humour in symbolysim...Altogether, a great offering form a Japanese film master, who is trying to deliver a complex plot to people who may have no concept of the seedy underside of gangster life, Japanese style. Kitano merely needs to adapt to the North American audience he wishes to win over....

If you are going the watch the movie expecting to see an ultra-violent gangster type movie you'll be disappointed. The scenes in between the blood and guts cuts are too slow to keep you interested. Actually, after having seen the trailers that was exactly what I was thinking I was going to see. So. Was I disappointed? Not a bit! This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Not to be appreciated however, without some basic knowledge of Japanese culture and ethics.The main character, Aniki Yamamoto, dies, figurally speaking, at the beginning of the movie as his master dies in a clan war. Were it a samurai-movie he would become a Ronin. A samurai without a master and without honor. But he is not a real samurai, he is yakuza. A brutal and merciless killer. A criminal. Still he shows nobility and honor in being loyal and faithful to those who have helped him. I think it is this contradiction that the movie is about. Aniki is a tragical hero, who in a last effort tries to re-establish what he was deprived of in Japan. At first he tries to build up a new empire, but somehow not whole-heartedly. When he finds new love and friendship he´s ready to hand over leadership. Although he doesn't abandon his fellow gangsters when war against a much tougher enemy is emerging.Takeshi is brilliant in depicting the hero both as a director and as an actor. As a director he shows all the aspects of criminal life. From extreme violent action to boring days spent in the office. As an actor he is Aniki. Big Brother to his comrades, a real friend to those he cares for and ruthless for those who stand in his way. Accompanied by a beautiful movie score and the stylistic way the scenes are filmed make it a masterpiece. Less is indeed more.

First is to think about the plot - a modern Japanese warrior enters a foreign land and forcefully builds an empire.  The second is the last name of the lead character which also happens to be same as the chief Japanese military strategist and planner of the Pearl Harbour attack, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto (look it up in the net).  Then you will realize why this is much more than a yakuza/gangster flick.By itself, the movie is already an outstanding gangster drama.  Like Kitano's other movies, it's funny at times, contemplative in others and yet it is even more gut-wrenchingly violent.  In many ways, comparing Hana-bi (one of his recent movies) to Brother is like putting fireworks against the atom bomb.  But this is appropriate since the movie represents much of Japan's history during the first half of the 20th century and does it extremely well.  Even the ending hits right on target in the state of affairs since that time.It is a tough movie to watch but well worth the experience.

In all Kitano's movies, there is a strong emphasis on visual effects including extreme violence but also breathtaking shots and slow filming. The motivation for this violence is to show the raw reality of the gangster society in Japan. The protagonist in all Kitano's movies is a (ex)yakuza who is fed up with life and does not tend to have a particular goal on earth. Paradoxally this doesn't mean he doesn't have any feelings. On the contrary while the end is always tragic, the main character always try to help other people out. This explains the double meaning of brother. The first one is related to the japanese word Aniki used amongst members of yakuza clans. The second one is related to the setting of this movie, Los Angeles, since it is used amongst african americans. Basically, this movie thus tells the story between a yakuza and a L.A. homeboy which ends in a tragic but beautiful way. Meanwhile we also get to know more about the Yakuza-culture. Important themes are loyalty, respect, sacrifice and friendship, which can also be found in traditional samurai movies. This movie is really worth seeing for the fact that it is sincere, beautiful, tragic and without pretentions. It might not be suited for everyone because of the explicit violence, but it is an essential part of the poetry of this film.

According to IMDb, the body count in this film is a whopping 78! Had I known this ahead of time, I probably wouldn't have watched this film. I am usually turned off by overly violent films, as too often there isn't much of a story and it's just an excuse for gross-out special effects that appeal to our lowest instincts. So did the film win me over or was it just another blood-fest? Well, it did impress me--that's for sure.Takeshi Kitano (also known as Beat Takeshi) wrote, directed and starred in this film. It begins in Japan and two rival yakuza clans are at war with each other. Eventually, to end the conflict, the surviving members of one clan officially join the other--all but one hard guy (Kitano). Instead of killing him, however, they send him overseas--to an exile, of sorts.Kitano arrives in America to stay with his younger half-brother. However, the younger guy is a punk drug dealer hanging with low-lifes--not a yakuza big-wig like Kitano. One of the younger half-brother's friends (Omar Epps) meets Kitano--and the meeting is very memorable! In fact, EVERYTHING about his dealings with Kitano turn out to be memorable. Kitano soon decides to take out the half-brother's enemies and starts a gang war with the Mexican gangs thanks to his crazy macho ways--and Kitano seems not the least bit concerned during all this as his face is quite deadpan and cold throughout. After all, in his mind, if people hurt you, just kill them...as well as their friends. He is truly a scary guy here! And, a scary get bent on taking over everything. At least it's nice to see a man with ambition! Following Takeshi's example, his small band of punks quickly grows. And, so does their ambition and love of violence. Among all this is a weird suicide scene (in fact, there was another really weird one later). I guess it makes sense, in a way...but man is it weird. And so the body count rises...very quickly. And the younger half-brother soon sees himself as a really, really bad guy--and it's easy to see that he and his friends are setting themselves up to fall.After seeing this film, I noticed it bore some resemblance to an earlier Kitano film--Sonatine. Both have very similar themes, a similar deadpan performance by Kitano and feature some oddly surreal scenes of mobsters at work and play. And, both have ENORMOUS body counts. While good films and I certainly could respect how they were crafted, they also were both pretty unpleasant viewing and I can't imagine watching more of these! Well made but yuck! By the way, it was nice to see James Shigeta in this film. He was once a very popular actor but hasn't been as active in recent years. Also, during the course of all the killing, did you notice that NEVER did any police respond to any of the gunfire?! Maybe it's just too common an occurrence in LA...or the film just forgot about this.

Strangely not on the subject of violence, which this is full of. Theories aside, something seems to happen to Asian filmmakers coming to work in the US. It's like they are removed from the very soul of what they create back home, so even when the reproduction is dutiful (here, the Wong Kar Wai film) it seems to lack the intuitive connection with the specific cinematic world.This lacks a bit of everything. A plausible scenario, meaningful relationships, the grim gravitas that propels beyond the mundanities of another story about gangland rivalries. The fish-out-of-water element of a Japanese yakuza coming to Los Angeles in search of his brother is really milked for all its worth. How many times can Takeshi deadpan the astonished locals? Awkward moments abound in this, really awkward. Example; a hotel porter politely waits around Takeshi in the hope he will get another huge tip like the last time. We get it, he's polite but only because there's money in it. Leaving the room frustrated, Kitano has him actually blurt out no tip this time! as though we needed to be sure. There's more of this, mostly situations with the English-speaking actors directed like pieces of wood. The two worlds never quite gel together, in the way that even briefly they do in The Yakuza.The charm here comes in the form of the casual moments inbetween the strident plotting that would take up the bulk of the Hollywood equivalent of this film. People hanging around, bonding over a game of basketball or throwing ball in a beach. It's what Johnnie To has been doing over in Hong Kong. But To builds with an eye for elegy, for tenderness about to be swept away by carnage and the carnage ennobled as ballet of violence. Takeshi on the other hand counterpoints the intimacy with bursts of brisk, senseless, mayhem.

I'm an Omar Epps fan so what could i say i couldn't pass this up. The first thing you'll notice in this movie is the sideways angles and his unique directing style. After a confrontation with Omar Epps character you find out how cool Beat Takeshi is he hardly says a word for the first 15 minutes. He portrays the essence of cool in his character. Once the movie really gets started it never stops. It takes you through the whole span of Beats attempt on L.A. First taking out the Mexican gangs then moving up. Until eventually his fall in the form of the Italian mob. THe movie isn't pretty the violence is often over the top. But Beat Takeshi does it in almost a comical way reminiscent of the Qeuntin Tarrantino movies. In the beginning of the movie you get to see Beat in his Yakuza gang in Tokyo and you get some insight on what it is like for those gangsters. Very different from the mobs and mafias of America. Beat is in my opinion the best gangster ever portrayed on cinema to date he doesn't talk that much only acts and you don't wanna get him mad. Omar Epps was a hidden surprise for me being in such a big role co staring next to Beat Takeshi. He holds his own as the Bosses Right hand man and they become close friends after a witty scene involving Omars character betting on dice with Beat and losing money then later Epps finds out there was a hole in the cup. The supporting cast is OK at what they do mostly to die and kill and for some very funny moments. Such as when one of the Hench men is playing basketball with his peers and he yelling for them to pass him the ball and he gets quickly infuriated and starts kicking the others to pas to him. The end is really something to me. Its very differently yet the same to the American gangster movies such as Scarface but does it in an off beat way. I recommend this movie to anybody who likes action or gangster movies or who wants a taste of the Japanese culture. Its one of my favorite movies by Takeshi definitely check this one out.

I recommend this film to anyone who likes gangster movies or violent flicks. Takeski Kitano is an extremely good actor/director. I rate it 4 out of 5. I also recommend Kitano's film Sonatine.

At the end of that movie, I said, What's the big deal with Kitano? to a friend. Then he figured out I had actors mixed up, and Kitano was the guy who stole the show and I thought was someone else. Brother was amazing, and sold me once and for all on Kitano. I won't spoil anything, but will say the violence is very unforgiving and will just make you stare at the screen open-mouthed. The cinematography is great, and it had patience scenes like you would in much western cinema (including over half a minute of Kitano walking up a street after arriving in America). Everything Kitano does is a joy to watch. His facial expressions are often subtle, just minor changes, but you tend to get it. The movie did not glorify the Yakuza in any way, and although I'm not very educated on the subject, may have made them out to be worse than they are (although it did stress their code of honour). In my opinion, this was better than the entire Godfather trilogy, and the best gangster flick I've ever seen.

'Brother', Kitano's mostly marvellous new feature, is imbued with all things Melville, from the opening silent wandering of Yamomoto, like Jef in 'Le Samourai', to the muted blue colour palette, faceless glass buildings and grey ritual beach of 'Un Flic'  Most pertinent, however, is Melville's under-rated 'Deux hommes dans Manhattan', which also starred the director.  Like that film, 'Brother' is Kitano's first American film, his first cultural work in the country of origin of the urban genre he has made his own.  And like Melville, instead of dealing with this country, Kitano seems to have become more obsessively Japanese, more interested in ritual, nation, Eastern philosophy.  In other words, Kitano has taken foreign money to make an uncompromisingly personal film which, like 'Boiling Point' and 'Kids' Return', turns the gangster film into a rite of passage.

Here, his brother is the leader of a small-time multi-racial gang, and Yamamoto encourages them to expand by taking over the local drug trade.Brother really struck a chord with me because of what it shows regarding race relations. It shows something I believe in very deeply and that is when forming relationships (be it love or friendship) with people, their character and principles should be the prime consideration and race should not factor into it.Why? One reason is that it makes more sense to affiliate with people based on character and principles rather than race, because character and principles can change but race cannot; if I refuse to be friends with a person of race X, then that person cannot ever be friends with me as long as he does not change his race. Additionally, if race is the prime consideration, then it is possible one may disregard or overlook positive qualities in a person to prevent the creation of a relationship with them, and even more dangerously, one may disregard negative character traits just so they can connect with someone.These are not conjectures, rather they are observations I have made in the almost thirty years I've been alive. Unfortunately, they're observations I have made much too often, starting from my formative years all the way to the somewhat cynical adult I am now. It really hurts me to see people from two countries detest each other over something that happened between their respective countries decades ago, even though these individuals had nothing personally to do with that event. Heck, I've met many of these people, whose default position is that they hate individuals from a certain country.Not often does a film come along that so eloquently speaks to me about issues that I care very much about. This is why I've somewhat unintentionally gone off on a tangent.The Yakuza members in this film are portrayed as ruthless individuals who carry out despicable acts and have no qualms about murdering innocent people to fulfil their needs and the needs of their (Yakuza) brothers, thus it is rather ironic that they do have some admirable qualities. One of those is that they consider the brotherhood between Yakuza members to be of more importance than familial relations (that is meant to be the ideal). Having seen this in the movie, I cannot help but think how much better it would be if we could apply a similar principle to our dealings with the people we meet every day (for good causes, of course, not criminal!).While many of the characters in this film are deeply flawed in many ways, such as the blind loyalty they show to their bosses, they are also shown to be very human. To pass the time, they play cards and basketball and various other games; they laugh and they make jokes; they give each other gifts; they have people they care about and they care about each other. Depictions of leisure time and activities to portray the humanity in characters we might traditionally hate is a great strength of Takeshi Kitano the director, and is present in his other films (Boiling Point and the masterpiece Sonatine come to mind). The resulting effect is that it is impossible to hate the characters, no matter how much you may want to.As in all Kitano films, there is a lot of humour, including some laugh out loud moments, and none of it feels out of place. As well as humour, many of Kitano's other trademarks are present, including off-screen violence (although there is much on screen violence as well, some of it eye-watering), lingering shots that continue after the scene has ended and ellipses, which is the technique of jumping from one scene to another and leaving what happened in between to the imagination.Regular Kitano collaborator, Joe Hisaishi, provides the score, and what a beautiful and pensive score it is. Someone who has not watched the film might feel the score would be out of place in a gangster film, however, it fits perfectly. As I write, the track I love you&#x85; Aniki is playing on my CD player, and thinking about the themes and characters in the film, I feel, at the risk of sounding unmanly, choked up.Takeshi Kitano brings Japanese style and sensibility to a gangster film set in America, and this was, based on an interview, his intention. This decision works very well and results in a poignant crime drama with likable and well-drawn characters. I did not appreciate Kitano's work five years back, however, he is now one of my favourite directors. I have not yet seen all his films but out of the ones I have, I highly recommend Kikujiro, Sonatine, Hana-Bi, Violent Cop, Dolls, Boiling Point and Zatoichi. I urge you to seek out and watch them, as well as Brother, of course. "},{"Title":"Oh, brother...","Date":"20 January 2016","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":" Brother starts off with a shot of Takeshi Kitano sloping shoulders, arched back, head cocked to the side, sun glasses and black suit. It is the unmistakable Kitano persona the tough guy whose motives and emotions are obscured by cool indifference, a slow walk and a poker face. It worked in his excellent debut feature Violent Cop and the even better Sonatine and Hana-bi. But in Brother it seems no more than a pose.Kitano is Yamamoto, an old school yakuza who refuses to capitulate after his Tokyo based clan has lost a battle against a rival gang. He relocates to Los Angeles where his younger brother is making a living as a small time drug dealer. With Yamamoto's help the small time drug dealing turns into a criminal empire, in which African American gangsters and Japanese works side by side to eliminate the Italian and Mexican competition.Brother makes little work of the cultural differences between the gangsters and the friendship between Yamamoto and his black second in command Denny (Omar Epps) remains underdeveloped. Which begs the question why would Kitano situate this story about the rise and fall of a criminal empire in Los Angeles? Was it a question of financing? Brother seems like an attempt to maximize Kitano's appeal as a cult phenomenon for Western audiences. The dry comedy and sudden bursts of violence, which were just some of the treats in his previous movies, seem to be the main focus of Brother, with Kitano exploiting them for maximum effect. The jokes are forced and seem like echo's from his previous movies. The violence - an endless series of shootings, murders and mutilations - is depressingly excessive and cannot sustain much interest without the poetry of Sonatine or the sadness of Hana-bi.

Some people don't care for this film, feeling that it's too Western in approach, lacking in the Zen and tranquillity department, but I have to disagree. I feel like this was the pinnacle of Takeshi's career when it was made, as if his earlier movies (VIOLENT COP etc.) were all building up to this moment, a film in which everything is done just right.It's not a film to describe too much, as that would spoil the story. Really, it's a tale of the rise and fall of a criminal gang, a Scorsese movie done on a small-scale, if you will. I loved the American setting and the East meets West themes, which I found added to the story greatly. It's a very violent film, with many scenes punctuated by shocking death, but it never seems gratuitous, more expected. As both star and director, Takeshi is at the top of his game here. Never has he been more icy cold, more stony-faced &#x96; and yet Aniki has to be the most honourable and respectable gangster he's ever played. The supporting cast is great, too, especially Omar Epps, who's given a really interesting character to play. All in all, a fantastic little film and one I look forward to watching again. "},{"Title":"Beat Takeshi takes America by storm","Date":"18 September 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":" The tag line, The Yakuza Takes On The Mafia promises great things, and Brother very nearly delivers greatness.The film starts with exiled Yakuza boss, Yamamoto (played by Kitano), arriving at LAX and heading off to find his kid brother. Yamamoto is referred to throughout the film as 'Aniki' (big brother), which assumes a literal and figurative value. Apart from being a damn good gangster film with an impressively high body count, Brother is also a film about fraternity; in particular, its ability to transcend cultural differences. Actions, after all, speak louder than words. This is something Aniki knows from long experience, and even as a stranger in a strange land he is unfazed as he sets about creating a new dynasty. His unflinching brutality and obvious gangster credentials evaporate the misgivings of his younger brother's hood friends instantly, earning Aniki their respect and establishing his place at the head of the new family.Brother is a multi-faceted gangster film, drawing on all of Kitano's directorial trademarks; stillness counterpointed with explosive action, subtle flashbacks, artful, unusual shot composition, and his ability to show the lighter side of human nature as well as the brutal - even finding time for a bit of dossing about on a beach (a sure sign that characters are taking time out from the grind of existence in a Kitano movie). Thematically, the film explores loyalty and shame as the key precepts in Japanese hierarchical society, each taking on a meaning greater than life itself. In some ways, Aniki is playing out the shame of his disgraced status from the moment he lands in the US - following a violent path to its logical conclusion. Although he takes his exile in good part for the sake of his sworn brother in Japan, he seems to arrive in L.A. with a death wish.If there's anything to detract from this enthralling film it's that the non-Japanese characters are too thinly drawn, being little more than ciphers for the most part. You could put that down to Kitano's difficulties with English dialogue, but if you were being more generous you'd say it was designed to give an impression of Aniki's world, the way he sees it.

The editing of the film is a bit confusing as it will have you seeing one thing before dropping you into a completely unrelated situation where you don't have a clue how the characters have gotten into the situation or why but that aside the cinematography is stunning, not through scenery or what's happening on screen but just through where the camera has been placed. The story when you break it down is more or less the same basis as a lot of Katino's films, the old ways vs the new but this so far has seemed to work. You might get a bit tired of seeing the same facial expression on Katino's face but again in this film it seems's to work.

On arrival he finds that his brother is a street-level criminal along with several others but that he is being squeezed and brutalised by other gangs. Born to war and violence, Aniki quickly draws a line in the sand, killing those that have been standing against the gang. This starts the rise of the gang from the street-level to holding actual turf within the organised crime world of LA, however the violent rise to power brings them increasingly into conflict with the larger masters of the scene.I eventually gave up listening to the Movies You Should See podcast (I got fed up hearing about this bit and that bit in what was essentially plot synopsis) one of the last I listened to reminded me that not only has it been over a decade since I saw a Kitano-directed film, but that I have actually seen surprisingly few of those considered required viewing. So as I unsubscribed on iTunes, I also went on LoveFilm and added a handful of these films to my list. Perhaps not the best place to start, the first to arrive was Brother, his first American film. As others have said it is not a totally successful mix but it is still an interesting and engaging one. Apart from some early flashbacks, the narrative is relatively linear and easy to follow but still very much in the style of Kitano in how detached, silent and violent it is.In these regards the film does deliver but it comes over as a twist on the many gangster films of the period where a Tarantino template was being followed. The patience and cold air to the story makes it feel interesting and different, which is what it is. Where it doesn't work as well is putting people, emotions and characters clearly onto the screen. There are one or two moments where stuff does come across but too often the detached eyes of the camera fed through onto the characters and story, making me not care that much about what was happening beyond the style and the basic story. This is a weakness for me and it is because of this that I consider it good but not great by any means.Kitano is visually and style-wise very good here but his rushed shoots and lack of rehearsal may have contributed to the cast not really always getting their characters beyond the specific actions of that scene. For himself, Kitano's trademark silence and cool air carries him but it is the other cast that struggle. Epps is a good presence in the cast but I didn't feel for him that much when compared to some of the minor actors who managed to convey a lot with just their faces and body language. Some have said about the language barriers but I do not think this was an issue so much as there just not being sufficient emotional content in the story, characters and performances.Brother is worth seeing as an alternative gangster film and an unusual product. It bares all the hallmarks of Kitano but for me personally I thought it didn't have enough in the way of heart in the main characters and this did seem to leave some of the cast focusing on the actions within each scene.

People like Elijah Wood; Samuel L Jackson and Bruce Willis would have made this movie. Even Quentin Tarrintino's acting is better than the American acting in this film.The direction is good but not as good as his Japanese films such as Hana BI or Zatoichi. The cinematography is very straight to video meets Fukasaku style close ups. I love that kind of cinematography as it creates a sense of putting you into shot. You see the film from the perspective of a stand in with plenty of great close ups on key characters. It makes it more violent even if the hits are off camera. I love the uniqueness of the off camera imagination shot as it makes it more interesting. Then again I am partial to on screen violence.The house party at the end is atrocious so is a large majority of the American acting sequences. Kitano is flawless in the film. He depicts a similar method acting to Sonatine. I think this film has massive problems with b level American acting and poor understanding of the dialogue.Kitano has made a brave film here which I respect but it is not a master piece such as his other works. I love Kitano but this film's errors are not down to him. The American acting here is on a par with Too Fast To Furious. Yeah it's pretty bad and these American actors don't do the dead pan and emotions are very overacted. Underplay it for a masterful acting experience.The Japanese acting is on par with Yakuza Graveyard, Audition, The Ring and other Japanese classic low budget films. Kitano does a good job of hiring the lead character from Graveyard Of Honour as he makes an awesome crime boss.Other Japanese characters take leafs out of yakuza movies and act solidly. The gun shoot outs are dramatic and intense which is so frequent in Kitano's work. Kitano's character shows a lot of humour as expected along with the tough guy character to the style of Joe Pesci in Goodfellas.This film is worth seeing. Especially for the role of the Yakuza Graveyard lead actor as an exceptional crime boss. Kitano is flawless but the film could oh so close be a master piece. It's one of the best low budget films of this period however more research by the actor selectors means it just misses out. A strong effort from a master film maker but not up to scratch with his classics.Kitano takes on Fukasaku and American cinema and holds out on his own.Track it down on DVD. The UK release contains and awesome documentary about Kitano. It's worth the DVD import price alone.

This film was cliché, The dialogue was poorly delivered. As a whole I felt that the film didn't translate very well, and I couldn't figure out whether he was trying to make a film about American gangsters meant for a Japanese Audience, or a film about Japanese gangsters for an American audience.One thing's for sure. If I was watching this in Japan, didn't understand English and just had to rely on Japanese subtitles, It would have been a lot more enjoyable for me. It would be like O.K. now they're speaking English, I can read the dialogue at the bottom of the screen, and it sounds as if Masayo Kato is really doing a great job as opposed to This guys has no idea what that line means Which you can't help noticing if you are an  English speaker. There are a lot of stereotypes types of Black America, and American organized crime, something which again I think might have played better to his native audience. The Mafia characters for example where way off, badly cast, kind of obligatory and forced. Though I also felt that the Yakuza characters didn't stray very far from the stereotypical (Again, I couldn't tell which audience he was pandering to)Also, I thought that Takeshi was above casting pretty boys such as Masayo Kato, and Komodo Maki just to beef up the returns at the box office. Their performances really weren't anything special, so I can only assume that he cast them to get the members of their fan clubs to buy a ticket. There was nothing really original or groundbreaking in this movie, not much that I hadn't seen before, and I got the overall feeling that Takeshi (who holds so many reigns; actor, editor, writer, and director) was having trouble functioning outside of his native environment which is why the film seemed so unpolished and sloppy. But I'm serious, I really did love this movie. I couldn't get it out of my head. I kept on watching certain scenes over and over in my mind for days. Perhaps Kitano managed to hypnotize me with his crazy editing. Perhaps I just love the way his main characters always kill themselves for the hell of it. Perhaps I love to watch male bonding.

There is no purpose there is only habit and the tragedy that unavoidably meets up with the hero who is after all unable to escape his character - even when given the chance.

Big brother then shapes his little brother's ragtag group of street thugs into a streamlined criminal enterprise.The violence in Brother is unadultrated; it is not stylized. The bloodshed is stark, primative and brutal. It depicts certain rites of Japanese gangsterism, such as severing pinky fingers as penance for gangland offenses.

Therefore I don't really agree that he acts in this movie, he simply appears a lot.Because such a lot of other actors around him act so well (Such as the surprisingly good Omar Epps) it does not make a difference, and Kitano is actually very appropriate in this movie, but he doesn't deserve an academy award for it ;).All and all a good movie, that does not try to give it a sensational touch like a lot of movies (like all those arnie and stallone movies in the eighties) but really puts effort in trying to describe something as violent as the Yakuza (the Japanese mob).

Brother feels at times better than his more lyrical gangster films (Hana Bai or Sonatine) and closer to the more straightforward attitude of Violent Cop or Boiling Point. This has advantages and disadvantages. The film misses the beauty but the apparent nihilism should make up for it and yet the film is not as depressingly suicidal as Kitano's previous works.On a plot level Kitano and his black brother are both offered ways out of situations that in previous films would have led immediately to a shoot out with no hope. Here both are saved by the actions of others and in the case of Epps part by the action of Kitano's character. This seems to point to why the film feels so violent. Unlike his previous Yakuza films Brother is set in the period of death that normally sets in towards the end. From almost the very beginning Kitano's character is marked for death. That the film turns into a series of bloodbaths is inevitable. The drive seems to be for Kitano's Yamamoto to return the favour of a period of grace before he dies.It is of course inevitable that nothing will save Yamamoto but in presenting a script where the main character tries to save another Kitano seems to be tempering the cold heart he normally covers over with lyrical filming.Ultimately a superb film that fails to capture the beauty seen before but replaces it with a closer examination of the character of Yamamoto, essentially the same man under different names in all of the Kitano Yakuza series. Two thumbs up but don't expect realism or poetry; this is a genre film stepped in the logic and rules of the Yakuza movies and to some degree the American gangster film.

It will certainly not appeal to the spoon-fed MTV generation of mainstream movie lovers, but if you liked films such as The Way of the Gun or Reservoir Dogs, you should certainly give it a try. Be warned - the film's portrayal of violence is extremely blatant; even John Woo fans will be cringing at parts.Kudos to Takeshi Kitano for his perfect performance as a Yakuza gangster and Omar Epps for his surprising yet poignant portrayal as the associate who becomes more than just a friend.

No doubt this is part of reason that the film has not received the critical acclaim that many of his others have, but I also thought that thematically it was more heavy handed than his previous outings.  The theme of Yakuza honour, which is central to much of Kitano's work is translated so literally (even used in the films title) that I found myself wishing for a bit of subtlety.  Kitano's wicked sense of black humour is in there too, so the film manipulates your emotions constantly; one moment you're laughing your head off, the next aghast as someone else's is blown off!  The supporting cast is pretty good too; it was a pleasure to see Ryo Ishibashi (recently seen in Audition) getting back into more familiar territory.  Most importantly, the interaction between the English speaking cast and the Japanese is well handled; it never degenerates into the usual comedy of misunderstanding that has been done to death in most movies where the main characters don't speak each others language or understand each others culture.  This for me was the most satisfying aspect of the film.

Kitano has a really blank, airy style in *Brother*.  Kind of reminded me of John Waters' style in Pecker or Cecil B. Demented in terms of the juvenile character relationships and the simple enjoyment of situations Kitano fosters in the screenplay (basketball scene, football scene, the various gambling games played between the main character and the black hooligan he befriended).  The language/culture challenge was interesting, but a lot more deep insight into Japanese vs. Western society can be found in Greenaway's Pillow Book.  Or maybe a closer example is Jarmusch's Ghostdog.  Are the Japanese inscrutable?  See Spoilers below.The best actor of the film is Omar Epps.  His final scene was a nice little roller coaster of emotion.  I don't agree with another reviewer that Kitano is not an aesthete (being what I called blank & airy is not to lack aesthetics--Pecker was a very nice movie).  The broken chopsticks scene from the POV of the victim was an acute aesthetic jolt, utilizing simplicity for maximum effect.  It's not just violence, it's depicting something in a new way, which takes aesthetic sensibility.  Judging from this film, I think Kitano likes to ponder gangster situations, their set up and outcome, and likes to add a lot to the mix and deal with it all in some original way. This is a decent obsession, and who needs some further point to a movie? Even if many of the films' elements can be found elsewhere, this flick is a worthwhile pay-off for Kitano's obsession and originality.A spoiler used to address whether the Japanese are inscrutable (as it seems Kitano wishes us to ponder judging from what he has the bartender say last) I knew the right hand man was going to shoot himself after failing the task given him.  Back at the limo, he was visibly embarrassed. I don't think this was intended as comedy by Kitano as another rash viewer judged.  This was an act of Japanese honor that you come to expect if you watch enough films about Japanese culture.  Add Akira Kirosawa to the Greenaway and Jarmusch heritage.  Add decades of exposure to Roddenberry's Klingon culture.  It's an honor/loyalty system, which requires the context of war to sustain itself (federation war, gang war, etc.).  If you still ask but why do they do it?, then the Japanese (or at least such strains of Japanese culture) are inscrutable.

It was brutal but I did not find it that brutal and it had a special human touch of Kitano. `Brother' has also the both sides but brutality was exaggerated this time and the human touch was  less than the former film. I would have omitted some of the brutal details but perhaps the director would like to say something with them. It has also it's kind of humor that is sometimes very black!! Since I didn't know so many Japanese I can't say if this kind of humor is characteristic for Kitano or it's the Japanese humor? You can also watch in this film a characteristical behavior of Japanese in some situations and especially that of the Yakusa (the Japanese Mafia)  with their very hard disciplinary rules.  They prefer to die as to lose. Gangsters of many minorities in the USA are also present in this movie and they show you how each group deals with things in its own way. There is also a characteristical Kitano touch that made endure all this brutality since I don't like violence at all. This differentiated it a bit  from other action films. If you are a Kitano fan I think that you should watch this film. Personally I liked `Kikujiro (1999)' and `Hana Bi (1997)' far more than this one!

Not only are their shootings, there are finger severings, self-disembowelment, and a very painful use for chopsticks (these images stay with you for a really, really long time).This is a good film, but a very ugly one as well.

But in my opinion this movie set a new standard for movies, which are trying to combine the very diverse film styles from Japan and the US; a real success, with small glitches; that i have to agree with ;)But nonetheless i was stunt how well this collaboration worked out. (yeah, i know; many people won't agree with me here) Especially if you compare this film, which was again a showcase for Kitano's brilliant talent, to other attempts of Japanese filmmakers to include American culture in Japanese films. The results are often hilariously bad. They are either very racist or pretty tacky.Now in this film the American actors are shining. They are believable living personalities. And the reason lies within the special Kitano film-making-technique, which totally differs from the well known Hollywood and Japanese Dorama construction kit-alike filmaking. And the other very important thing is, that the American part is neither colliding with the Japanese style nor is it being manipulated by the Japanese part. I was also amazed by the special way the American cast acted. It felt sometimes way more natural than in all these cliché Hollywood productions. A simply fascinating symbiosis of those two film-styles. Kitano stated that he doesn't plan to do another film like this one; well, that's OK with me. This makes Brother as an experiment and as a movie more unique anyway. ;)Well this is one of many reasons, why this film has to be considered a masterpiece. So there is far more to praise The beautiful and dramatic music by Joe Hisaishi, the very fitting/stylish costume design, the incessant stunning photography and the very censoriously storyline, which shows that building your own cartel might confront you with some bloodshed ... ;)well, that's it!

If you don't like this one you probably won't like all the others ... except the less violent ones like Dolls or A scene at the sea for instance; those are also fascinating pieces of art and shouldn't be ignored!

Brother has a lot of action, violence, humour, and style but Kitano still finds time for his usual existential ponderings and quiet, contemplative scenes. It is a film about comradeship, about overcoming racial (amongst others) boundaries to gain respect and friendship.Kitano stars, with shades, as Aniki Yamamoto a Japanese Yakuza member famed for his abilities, loyalty, and strengths. He is forced to leave the country and goes to America in search of a younger brother he has not seen in years. There he realises that his brother is a small-time gangster, and that he can help his gang to become the most powerful in the city. Soon he sparks up an unlikely friendship between himself and his brother's gang and earns their respect by his coolness under pressure and knowledge of the trade. His plan works well, but soon other local gangsters decide to team up against him leading to death, revenge, and honour.Again there is more said in a single glance than by five minutes of dialogue, though Kitano realises the difference between West and East in this regard, and the Americans are shouty from the start. There is the usual sadness throughout the film which permeates most of Kitano's work, but there is plenty of humour too. Kitano gives another cool performance, Epps is good as Denny, as is Maki as Kitano's brother Ken who has become Americanised. The violence is not as shocking as in his other films, but is just as sudden, fast, and meaningful. There are few directors around at the moment with this style- emotionally strong, character driven stories with stylish violence, and Kitano is one of the even fewer who can repeatedly pull it off.8 out of 10 "},{"Title":"Takeshi at his meanest and his best.","Date":"16 January 2005","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":" A Japanese gangster is exiled to the United States where he moves in with his little brother...together he starts up all the drug/turf control troubles he just left when he and his brother try to become bigshot dealers.The highlight of this move is the action and violence...and after that Takeshi is the best thing this movie has going for it.Lots of fast action and gunfire.Omar is OK in it but Over the top in his acting...the half brother is very good.If you like good action with high production standards watch this one.

Brother consists of consecutive scenes depicting violent assasinations of rivals, followed by scenes featuring retaliations by the aforementioned rivals. The is no sense of allegiance or even alignment with Yamamoto and his associates (including Omar Epps, in one of his worst performances yet). We never get inside the mind of Yamamoto and Kitano leaves us with a ruthless, stoic, unendearing zombie wearing sunglasses all day long, hardly talking and thus failing to make us care about him or his actions. I have no problems with scenes of people cutting of their thumbs as long as they serve somekind of purpose in the plot. Kitano seems to have no motivation whatsoever for showing us these images, beside maybe shocking us. Furthermore, he includes various scenes that don't have any purpose in the movie at all. It all makes for a very confusing and uneven piece of work. Acting-performances in Brother are bland and very poorly delivered, with the actors saying their lines without any sense of conviction or purpose. Kitano's poor writing only makes matters worse. Also, cinematography in this picture is handled very poorly (just as every other aspect of Brother). There is no direction in most of the shots, beside making sure the actors appear in them.

He is sent to America where he looks up his younger brother who has gone off the rails a little bit. Not joined-the-Yakuza path, but dabbling in minor drug dealing and stuff.Aniki (means Big Brother in Japanese) promptly takes over the rabble and forms his own gang of 5. Not content with running his own small time show he promptly sets about an expansion program that would leave his shareholders giddy (if they existed). Only like the dot-com boom and bust Aniki operates in a field with many competitors and precious few behavioral boundaries, so this was never going to end happily.What sets Brother apart from the usual drug wars' films is that it isn't made like one. There are long dialogue-free scenes that are allowed to roll out and develop at their own pace, only to be punctuated by sudden acts of great violence, and not the guy leaps into air after explosion violence, I mean guy gets chopsticks forcefully pushed into skull stuff, or man picks up broken bottle and sticks it in other man's eye.Aniki himself speaks no English upon arriving in the US, so his instructions are passed down through his little brother and eventually his 2IC Kato that followed him across from Japan and shows unwavering loyalty at all times. Aniki grabs himself a girlfriend, although it is never shown if she is actually his platonic missus or a trinket (or even a pet) that he likes around, and his best friend in the gang is Denny (Omar Epps), a young thug and the unfortunate recipient of the broken bottle mentioned above. The two bond over gambling on anything and everything, despite not speaking each other's language, and it seems that Aniki wants to take Denny under his wing from almost Day 1.As the business expands it takes over new turf and incites anger from new enemies and rivals. Everything is run with the Yakuza code of honour and disloyalty and betrayal are both met with savage repercussions. Unfortunately if there is one thing that the Star Wars prequels showed us (aside from not knowing when to stop) it is that there is always a bigger fish. Ultimately the gang grows too big and a mad scramble is made to flee as the tone changes.It is hard to discuss Brother without making it sound like a whiz-bang action film, it isn't that though. It has action elements sure, but maybe 4 brief scenes in the movie, a far cry from your Lethal Weapons and co... Brother is more a deliberately paced drama that tells a familiar story, but in a different way and with an unfamiliar backdrop.For some reason I found it compelling at all times, even in the slow(er) spots when it seemed to pause for no reason, and I wanted it to continue on and on. I've seen Brother maybe 5 times now, and each time I pick up the DVD cover I know how great this film is, but I press play and let the following 2 hours prove it to me again.As bat-sh*t crazy as some aspects of Japanese culture seem to Westerners these days, there is a lot to admire about the way they conduct their business at times, even in a violent crime film (and I am no Scarface / New Jack City slack-jawed admirer of all things criminal).Final Rating - 8.5 / 10. A pretty straightforward plot Guy starts business. Business grows. Business hits trouble. But told in a very effective way.

Kermode noted that both Jackie Chan and Kitano play 'fish-out-of-water' characters in their respective films, but whilst Chan's character comes to the US from Hong Kong and initially doesn't really fit in but becomes more American by the end of the film, Kitano's character comes to the US from Japan, and becomes increasingly more Japanese as the film goes on. He not only doesn't fit in, but he allows his 'fish-out-of-water' status to reaffirm his identity.That is not to sat that he doesn't make friends, and that is, in fact, the main theme of the story. He finds true friendship and identification with someone who, initially, seems to be his polar opposite, a young black American, a small time hood. This film emphasises the point that whilst culturally people from another country may be very different, there can still be a connection, bond and respect formed between them.Essentially this film can be viewed as a counter-point to Kitano's earlier masterpiece Sonatine, and just as with that film, the plot is basically a man going on a long detour before committing suicide. As with Sonatine, during this detour, the main character and more importantly the audience, learn some valuable lessons about life.

Therefore I sat down to watch Brother, via Film4, peppered with positive expectation. I was not disappointed.There is something about the man Kitano which is most intriguing. This element of the man translates onto his films most effectively. Fortunately I was completely ignorant as to what to expect from Brother except the rudimentary blurb within my television programme guide. Immediately, upon seeing Kitano, I was transfixed. Within his acting he carries the ability shared only with Steve McQueen which can only be summed up through a critic's quote I read once in the 70s referring to McQueen, He can act with the back of his head. Mr Kitano possesses this same gift. Add to this the fact that he wrote, edited, directed and starred in Brother only stimulates my interest in the man to a greater degree.Beat Takeshi has a menace about him and his character within this film is unpredictable or, as a line in this film commented inscrutable. Perfect for the character of Aniki. Despite the violence within this epic the film is primarily Kitano's character and relationships.True, he goes from incident to incident placing himself in ever more perilous situations as this is the character of the story but I see more to the film than this surface fundamental impression. The film appears to be more in line with the title Brother. It is a story centring on relationships, albeit relationships within quite a turbulent backdrop. The violence should not get all the focus.Another reviewer mentioned tying this film to such stories as Reservoir Dogs; but I disagree. Relationships, made clear in the dénouement, strengthen this argument. One knows the background of Aniki, a violent and nefarious fellow, but his character, the character of the man, outshines what he actively does in the story, objectively speaking. His relationship with the superbly acted Omar Epps as Denny is touching. Clearly the highlight of the film.Well done, Takeshi Kitano. Well done.

Kitano uses offbeat camera angles to create a sense of disorientation as he plays a gangster fleeing from Japan to hide out with his stepbrother in L.A. Enforcing a brutal takeover of the city's underworld (unflinchingly exterminating any Italian or Asian crime bosses who stand in his way) for no other apparent reason than to just do it (the film is a perfect example of existential theory), he remains aloof from all who surround him except for one of his henchmen (Omar Epps) and even there the relationship is tenuous at best. Kitano's take on L.A. is unusual, a sort of cross between Tarentino and Antonioni, where the streets are deserted except for a small criminal contingent (there are no police; a massacre in a hotel conference room goes off without interference) and a place where the sun can't peek through the smog--but it's perfect for Kitano's depiction of the void. Far too foreign for mass audiences and too violent for the art crowd, it's nonetheless an interesting creation from a filmmaker with an uncompromising vision.

Akani (Kitano) is a hit-man who has bitten off more than he can chew- killed some of the wrong people, if at the right place at the right moment- and is advised to leave the country. He joins his brother in LA and soon he and a rag-tag group of hoodlums- mostly by way of the chilling, quiet audacity and cunning shooting skills of Anaki- rise the ranks as big-time crime lords in LA... that is, until, they mess with the Italians.This part of the story, admittedly, is rather typical and maybe just something Kitano felt he had to work with as one of those staples of the genre rise and undoubted fall of a skilled but flawed criminal mastermind/killer. But Brother is most impressive not for its plot, which can occasionally appear ragged and disconnected (perhaps by design as Kitano is the editor), but for presentation. Kitano himself as a presence/star/actor is so cool that had he been around during Melville's time he could wipe the floor with Alan Delon and even Belmondo in the bad-ass department. This is just one component to Brother's success though since Kitano could put himself in just about anything and make that part of it look cool. Coolness isn't enough in Brother, and rightfully so; this isn't a fun movie entirely to watch, even if one might feel guilty in enjoying some of the more crazy shoot-outs and bouts of violence.The body count here, according to the trivia, is 78. This is a high number, but despite seeing it in a cut R-rated version it doesn't feel very compromised (mayhap it is and I'm being naive, but it's a first-time viewing all the same). It's a real sight to see to witness how Kitano makes these encounters of violence surprising; the first big one, with the first time Omar Epps and Kitano run into each other on the street (glass breaks, scoff and demand, glass cut to the face) the way its edited is fantastic in timing and perception- not minimalist, but something a few beats different then what one would normally see. We also see Kitano's knack at unusual but inventive framing devices, like a dark, massive shoot-out under a bridge at night with warring gangs, and only the lights from the guns blazing off of the bodies. Other moments like these are a sight of bodies laid out in the Japanese word of Death, and when one gangster is already dead when a group in a car pull up to a house Kitano focuses on that. The final shoot-out, as well, is unexpected.It's not a great movie, and suffers from the flaws mentioned at the top. Yet I'd recommend Brother to any genre fan, to those chest-deep in Yakuza flicks and one who's only aware of Kitano from Zatoichi. This is no Shoot Em Up, but a serious picture about the damning implications of a life devoted to self-destruction and annihilation for stupid, materialist and territorial goals. If it's not anything entirely new its film-making enriches what's conventional, and Kitano is always clever at bending the lines.

Everything in this project knows where that center is and adds to the being built around it. The central character of course has the same personality as the film, something I especially appreciate meditative tension - no deliberation, only principled reaction.The female lover is something of note. Any project like this, where the presenter is so omnipresent, must have a token `viewer' as white space. Joy Nakagawa is a sort of model/celebrity interviewer, a media type more recognizable in Japan. Here, she is tarted up appropriately and the effect of her presence is subtle (as most everything here). Her demise is a dual of the similar hostage situation of Aniki, where Denny shoots, does some damage but saves the day.

Scary movie looked like an interesting parody, but it's become one of the worst comedies ever made. Titus was bad too; although I personally had hoped for another great big-budget film such as Gladiator or The Patriot; considering that the story was originally written by Shakespeare, of course.  Well, Brother might even be worse than those two previous films.  I can hardly think of a picture that is so brainless and far-fetched at the same time.  I thought that this would be another great crime-action-thriller with impressive stunts and great action scenes such as in Mission Impossible 2, or a film that has some interesting characters or maybe even a pretty original storyline - or decent acting performances - or excellent camerawork - whatever. But this film has nothing.  The storyline is one of the worst ever.  The acting is very weak.  There's absolutely no talking about a director since the camerawork is not even worth mentioning.  Still, I have seen films that were pretty good in spite of a lousy storyline, acting AND shooting.  The reason why is because they compensate this 'emptiness' with breathtaking visuals such as exploding vehicles or buildings, awe-inspiring car chases or overwhelming special effects that look great on a big screen.  Nothing of this kind is to be seen in this brutal picture. I do realize that this is not an American picture, but at times it's simply too ridiculous for words.  I know that the Chinese people live in a whole different world from ours, but there are multiple scenes that are so bad that I start to wonder how this film ever made it to Europe and America.* POSSIBLE SPOILERS *To me these are the worst scenes in the film A man cuts off his own finger because he has to apologize. Another man wants to show his respect towards his friend and shoots himself in the head. There's a guy who slashes his own belly in order to prove to the rest that they can really trust him.  His intestines are spilling out and the 'fake' blood makes the whole thing too messy.  This kind of humour isn't funny anymore and if this is to be taken seriously, than this is a picture for mentally handicapped people. But there's more to come.  The characters are most uninteresting, especially the main character of the film.  This guy is supposed to be tough, but instead he's awfully monotonous.  The film tries very hard to be original and amusing, but fails miserably!  The whole concept of the film is so unbelievable that you would like to turn back time with the intention of choosing a different film. The plot is a failure as well and the emotional scenes were awful and they didn't have any effect on me whatsoever.  I guess I expected to see some great fighting scenes, but even that was out of the question.  Unless you want to throw your money down the drain, I highly recommend you NOT to go and see this film.  Most likely, there are better films to be seen than this one here.

The story is of an exiled Japanese gangster, moving his theater of action and executions in California. Scarcely a couple of minutes pass without a shooting scene that leaves behind several corpses, or another more violent action taking place. The problem is that little of this violence makes sense from an artistic or logic point of view. At some point in time one looses the count of the gangs that have been eliminated, and does not know in what shooting scene some of the characters got lost. It is well filmed and acted and I can feel an important director made this movie. However, he should look for more important themes if he wants his movies to be important as well. The only human story - the relationship (I am hesitant to call it friendship)between Kitano's character and the one played by Omar Epps - does not justify the long series of senseless violence the viewer is exposed to.Unless you are a big fan of violent gangster movies, this film will not satisfy you.

Usually, I would consider that a good thing; Brother just doesn't work though.  Takeshi Kitano is a boring actor who has the charisma of pavement.  There are too many long takes that hurt the narrative of the film.  For example, there are a few scenes where the camera will stop and just observe; like when the audience is made to watch some gangsters play basketball for five minutes.  Huge action scenes are not even shown -- although the film is graphically violent.This film could have been great, but it went too far out of its way to be stylistic, and in the end it just doesn't get the job done.

I have never seen a more simplistic, stupid screenplay in my life. What I resent, is the patronizing way this film is getting high marks, all because it is Japanese. Mark my words, if this film was made by an American, it would premiere on late night Cinemax. I am betting that the actor/director that wrote this film got all of his knowledge about organized crime from watching two Miami Vice episodes in the mid 1980's. I am not even going to go into how bad the acting was and it was. The film has a premise that you think might work. A disgraced Yakuza member leaving Japan to start new in America. However, his meteoric rise up the crime ladder is just comic book. Of course they try to tack on a love story, so as the film will fill out the standard formula. Some of the attempts at humor in this film were just horrible. I have never heard a more silent audience at some of the supposed humor gags. One reason you might want to go to this film, is to predict the upcoming scenes. Let me tell you, you will be one step ahead of the actors in this one, because everything is so predictable. I guess, that if I were able to shave a hundred points off of my IQ, I might have been able to enjoy this one. Avoid this piece of sushi, it is foul. * out of **** , and that is being very nice.

Bringing his particular brand of problem solving skills, he quickly carves for himself a nice little criminal niche within the vast L.A. underworld.  First, Aniki takes on the Mexican mafia, portrayed as the smallest in the pecking order of criminal organizations.  Then, he takes on a Japanese gang, eventually absorbing them through the efforts of his trusted lieutenant.  After that, he takes on the Chinese, and makes for himself, and his followers, a comfortable living.  Eventually, however, this little troupe of petty criminals take on something too big for them to handle, the Italian mob, and their world comes crumbling down around them.  I would like to say that there is more to the plot, but sadly, it is about as deep as it gets fairly linear, with no surprises.Although Takeshi Katano has done some good work, the characters in this film are all two dimensional.  Add in the wooden acting of most of the actors, it is actually quite painful to watch.  In over ninety percent of the film, Katano¡¦s Aniki bears a wooden expression that presumably was meant to portray coolness and calmness, but only succeeded in looking bored.  His brother¡¦s character did manage to look like the scared wet-in-the-pants kid that he was supposed to be, though one is hard not to think that the look is achieved by accident instead of thespian skills.  Omar Epps has the black character, Denny, down pat, though that is unlikely to be a stretch, playing his own ethnic group. The character portrayed in a most believable manner is that of Aniki¡¦s lieutenant, though he, too, was on the verge of over-acting, a common trait among Japanese actors.An interesting aspect of watching the interactions between all these badly acted, and even more badly scripted, characters is that one gains a glimpse into the Japanese mind, assuming Katano¡¦s opinions are representative of the Japanese ones.  Upon seeing the first lines spoken by an American, the taxi driver, one can immediately feel the depth of the cultural chasm and misunderstanding between the Japanese and Americans.  The United States, Katano seems to be saying, is the land of greed and discrimination. All they want from the Japanese is money. And the Japanese will be discriminated against whether the money is forthcoming or not.  The film does make a point of this, as Aniki made sure anyone who slurred the Japanese within his hearing range met with the proper punishment.  As a study in cultural differences, the film falls well short, resorting to cultural stereotypes which are flat and do nothing to advance his cause.Overall, the film falls short in any category that one may assign it to it is unexciting if regarded as a gangster story, and too shallow if regarded as an exploration of cultural or philosophical differences between Japanese and American gangs or lifestyle.  The most difficult to swallow, however, is Katano¡¦s attempt to portray the Japanese as the superior and ¡§inscrutable¡¨ race. In short, the film becomes a work to convey Katano¡¦s thinly veiled idea of Japanese cultural and racial supremacy, echoing those advocated by the Japanese during World War Two and have never been cast away.

And you can sell it as an art house movie to your girlfriend. That said, the movie is very linear, unnecessarily violent, and despite it being an American - Japanese film, full of the worst stereotypes of both worlds. LA crime infested, police totally absent; Americans only in it for the money, spineless and daft; Yakuza upstanding men of honor who spend their time shouting at their henchmen, cutting off fingers and committing hara-kiri; the Japanese mysterious, inscrutable, obsessed with honor and hierarchy; Japanese women submissive 20 year old waifs. Kitano seems to consider the Japanese a superior race to Americans in general and blacks, Italians and Mexicans in particular. The entire film and his acting is condescending and formulaic, as if he was thinking I will just twitch my lip a bit and not speak a word, that will be good enough for the American market.On video, after a hard day's work and a few beers, this movie is probably decent fare, but definitely not worth the price of a cinema ticket. I am annoyed that so many reviewers seem to have been deceived by the movie's art house flair, there is nothing intellectual about it. I would, however, strongly recommend it to JB lovers, to show them that the same effect can be achieved at a friction of the budget.

And later action scenes, some of which last only seconds, do not establish who is assaulting whom, for what reason, or attempt in any fashion to connect the violence to a previous plot-event. Post-modernism is achieved through laziness and stupidity. The dialogue is contrived, reflecting only stereotypes of ex-pat Japanese and L.A. black men.
