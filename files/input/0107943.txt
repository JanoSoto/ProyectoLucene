I was glad I did. In fact, I was so impressed with this film that a week later I went out and bought the book, which is even better. First of all, the film is a tremendous visual treat. There are some great interior scenes of the Darlington mansion, and great colors inside and in the surrounding outside scenery. This is simply a beautiful film. Second, the acting of Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson was spectacular. They were riveting. The way they deliver dialog and the expressions of their faces.....magnificent acting. Thompson's sad look in the back of the bus near the end of the movie is the saddest, most haunting look on a person's face I have ever seen in 50 years of movie watching. Hopkins, one of the best actors of this generation, provides a tremendous character study of a man who has been taught that to be the best in his profession, he must suppress all emotion. In doing so, he never learns to think for himself and he misses out on what could have been the love of his life. In that regards, this is a very frustrating story.However, this isn't just a tragic romantic story. Hopkins' character is wonderful example, too, of unselfish devotion and dignified servitude in the face of any kind of circumstance. This is an extremely beautiful, intelligent and sensitive film. If when people tell you, They don't make 'em like they used to, show them this film.

And to hail it as such is to grossly undersell it.  It is not only that but also the best story of unrequited love in cinema history, and a masterpiece of understated emotion.  It also boasts some of the finest performances ever put on film, most notably from the peerless Anthony Hopkins.Then again, understatement is the key to this film.  Writer Ruth Prawer Jhabvala and Director James Ivory adapt Kazuo Ishiguro's poignant novel with such delicacy that it gets under ones skin in a deeply profound way difficult to express in a few words.The plot opens in the 1950's as meticulous and emotionally repressed butler Stevens (Anthony Hopkins) reviews a lifetime of service in Darlington Hall.  The story flashes back to the 1930's where Stevens formed a close friendship with housekeeper Miss Kenton (Emma Thompson).  This relationship grew slowly over several years and ultimately the pair developed romantic feelings for one another, although neither admitted it.  Whilst all this was happening, Steven's employer Lord Darlington (Edward Fox) gradually became a misguided Nazi sympathiser in pre-war Europe.  Unfortunately, loyalty to his master caused Stevens to reject the delicate advances of Miss Kenton.  History took its inevitable course, and Darlington's involvement in appeasement contributed to the outbreak of World War II.  Now Stevens realises he made a mistake and wants to make amends.To describe Anthony Hopkins as brilliant is completely redundant.  His turn here goes way beyond mere acting, and it was criminal he was denied the Oscar at the 1994 Academy awards.  Stevens absurdly repressed personality gently takes the audience from laughter to tears in the most emotionally devastating finale I have ever seen.  Hopkin's mesmerising performance is matched by a career-best turn from Emma Thompson.  The supporting cast is uniformly superb, including a pre-Four Weddings Hugh Grant and Christopher Reeve in one of his last roles before the accident that paralysed him.Needless to say, the cinematography, music, editing and art direction are immaculate.  The understated beauty of the English countryside that was so important to the book translates brilliantly to film here.This is a lovely, melancholic film, which effortlessly embraces complex themes such as misguided loyalty, dignity, pride, wasted lives, and unrequited love.  It would be all too much to bear if it weren't for the film's genuine good-humoured understanding of English culture (all the more remarkable for having been initially penned by a Japanese author).  In fact, humour is an important element in the film.  There are many laugh-out-loud moments, which make the tragic part of the story all the more real and poignant.  All in all, The Remains of the Day is a milestone film &#150; an unforgettable tragedy of a man who pays the terrible price of denying his own feelings.

The film does a wonderful parallel examination of the man's life set against the tumult of the 1930s that effectively did away with the British Empire and made him and others like him, as people curiously obsolete.An extremely rare example of sanity when dealing with the subject of War. Most films as we know too well, concentrate on the futility and bottom line cost in humanity, which is to be expected since generally speaking, an artist will always present this point of view. However in most cases, it's an incomplete and wildly immature handling of the topic. This film addresses if you can believe it, the folly of avoiding War thru appeasement, and hammers home what might have been avoided if the British had called Hitler to the carpet early on, instead of playing chess with him. This is the backdrop; the main story is that of the butler, Stevens, an ostensibly simple character played with unimaginable complexity, by Hopkins. The fascinating examination of one man's sense of duty, a devotion that transcends all other obligations and aspirations in his life has never been so poignantly or expertly presented to an audience. Everything about the film, the supporting cast in particular is a rousing triumph. I cannot overly recommend this.

They both definitely have feelings for each other, but both seem to be bound by duty, honor, and society.  Hopkins is not the type of person who shares his inner-most feelings with anyone and Thompson wants to share her hidden love for Hopkins, but is frightened for various reasons.  The fact that the film is told during flashbacks which took place just before the involvement of England in World War II just makes everything that much more interesting and heart-wrenching.  During the present-day of the movie it appears that Hopkins and Thompson will finally proclaim their love for one another, but in the end that is not even a real certainty.  Ruth Prawer Jhabvala's adaptation of the novel is exceptional and James Ivory's direction has rarely been better or more focused.  With all this said, it is Hopkins and Thompson that dominate the action and make The Remains of the Day one of the best films of the 1990s.  5 stars out of 5.

I think that perhaps these comments reflect both the lack of an adequate attention span and a lack of a proper knowledge and perspective of the times. The Remains of the Day requires both. I found it to be an interesting movie with many facets, each of which could be used as the sole theme of a movie. It is a movie that has great acting, is beautifully filmed in and around one of England's great mansions, and tells a fascinating and complex story as well.It is true that the movie is about, in part, what many in the audience would believe is a romance that never has a chance because of Mr. Stevens' devotion to and pride in the occupation he has chosen. It is important to recognize that it is the job of his choosing, not one that has been forced upon him. It is tempting to write the job off as no more than servant of the wealthy, but it is actually the equivalent of presidency of a small company. Stevens is in charge of seeing that the large staff serving Darlington gets all of the many jobs in the household done - to perfection - every day of the week. I doubt that the White House has standards that approach those of Lord Darlington. So, each viewer can decide for himself or herself whether there could have ever been a woman in Stevens' life to whom he could give husband-like devotion.Darlington is not a Nazi sympathizer. He is a man who exhibits the ideals of 20th century Britain honor, fairness, and full devotion to what is right. He believes, most would say correctly, that the Treaty of Versailles was unduly harsh in its treatment of post-WWI Germany. Unfortunately, he fails to recognize, as many Americans do now, that unfairness in the past cannot be rectified by stupid policies in the present. So, by seeking what he considers fairness for Germany in the 1930's, when Hitler's evil and expansionist aims should have been clearly evident, he and others set the stage for a world-wide conflict that cost 60 million lives, of which the lives lost in Hiroshima and Nagasaki constitute less than one-half of one percent.One of my tests of a movie is how far into it I start looking at my watch. In this case I began looking at my watch not to see how much more I had to sit through rather, I was hoping to assure myself that there was enough movie left to provide a satisfactory ending. There was however, I could have enjoyed much more of the talent and story I was seeing.

His interaction with the lovely and intelligent housekeeper, Miss Kenton, is so realistic that it is painful to watch. Despite his growing love and admiration for her, he keeps his feelings firmly under control, determined that they will not destabilize his carefully crafted existence. Always expecting Stevens to make the first move, Miss Kenton tries everything in her power to get under his skin or to make him jealous, but she only succeeds in torturing them both all the more. The emotional turning point of the movie takes place in Mr. Steven's private room, where he has fallen asleep in his chair while reading a novel. Enter Miss Kenton in a playful mood carrying another bunch of flowers to brighten up his quarters. Curious about his reading material, she tries to get the book away from him because he refuses to tell her what it is. She moves in close, as close as they ever will be, and as she struggles for the volume, Stevens longingly admires her lovely countenance, her soft hair, and no doubt gets a good strong whiff of her sweet fragrance, wishing he could gently kiss her and take her in his arms, but that would lead to ... what? Finally, he allows her to pull the book from his grasp and Miss Kenton finds that it is far from what she had expected, being just some sentimental old love story. This is, of course, a poignant revelation. She looks up at him, her love as obvious as their proximity, and they gaze into one another's eyes for a few brief seconds. Then Stevens simply tells her to please respect his privacy and to leave him alone. Callously rebuffed, she does just that, for the rest of his earthly days. It is the biggest mistake that Mr. Stevens has ever made, and for a very competent and exacting man, it is all too apparent that he must have made many such extremely serious errors. On her next evening off, he watches helplessly from the window as Miss Kenton rides her bicycle into town, knowing that on that very day, he has somehow all but lost her for good. The pain and anxiety on his face are palpable, if brilliantly underplayed. Stevens gets one final chance to forestall the inevitable, her impending marriage to Tom Bent, but as per usual, does nothing to stop it because duty calls. Nearing the conclusion of the movie, when they are reunited after a generation has passed, Stevens is crestfallen to learn that Miss Kenton has changed her mind at the last minute and, following her divorce, will not be returning with him to resume her duties as housekeeper at Darlington Hall. Instead, she has chosen to remain in the west country in order to help bring up her granddaughter. Of course, poor sad Stevens couldn't even consider seeking employment in that locale in order to eke out a few years of bliss with Sara in what remains of his sad, lonely life. When they part company for the last time, he holds onto her hand for as long as he can, then as she tearfully rides away in the bus, he lifts his hat to the only woman he has ever loved and who has ever loved him. As if on autopilot, Stevens climbs back into the Daimler and turns over the engine. The hollow, utterly defeated look on his face belies the fact that the only thing left for him now is to face his inevitable death in a few short years. The camera does a closeup on the car's headlight and he starts back for his comfortable old rut of a life. Stevens was the consummate professional whereas his rival, Bent, placed strict limits on what he would tolerate from his employer, one of Lord Darlingon's aristocratic and bigoted colleagues. As such, he simply resigned from service in order to live life on his own terms. He doesn't squander his second chance to marry Miss Kenton and easily takes her away from Stevens, who obstinately and pridefully clings to his all-consuming job as far more important than affairs of the heart. Why? Perhaps because he is very skilled at the former and extremely inept at the latter. Instead of experiencing all the tenderness that the admiring Miss Kenton wanted to give him, he chose instead the importance of his position at Darlington Hall, a world stage where matters of serious consequence were considered in the midst of vast and lush grounds set in the beautiful English countryside. At the conclusion of the movie, we follow a trapped pigeon that is released from the confines of the mansion. It flies heavenward, and as the moving score builds to crescendo, we are treated to a bird's eye view of the magnificent estate for which Stevens has given up everything to be a part. What exactly does the pigeon represent? We can only guess, but one thing is certain. The Remains of the Day is a beautiful and poignant movie, wonderfully acted by the two principals and effectively supported by the rest of the cast. Further, the writing, cinematography, score, and directing are nearly flawless. This has to be one of the best movies of the last several decades.

Add flawless performances from the all-star cast and the result is almost too perfect.  But there is just enough humility to this sad tale of unrequited love to make it completely believable.Anthony Hopkins excels as the impenetrable Mr. Stevens, Butler of a lordly country house in the final days of the British Empire, and Emma Thompson is superb as his foil, Housekeeper Miss Kenton.  Both give wonderfully deep, sensitive portrayals of two complex lonely people who don't realize, until it's too late, that they belong together.  Swirling around them is fascinating drama of life upstairs and downstairs and there are as many surprises and sub-plots to the story (based on a novel by Kazuo Ishiguro) as there are secret passages, nooks, and crannies in Darlington House. An all-round first-rate cinematic experience, Remains of the Day is one of those pictures that lingers in the mind long after the credits pass.  A must see.  One poignant note this was the return to the big screen of actor Christopher Reeve, as American millionaire Congressman Lewis, whose life nicely frames the storyline. Two years later Reeve became paralyzed after being thrown from a horse.

They have not seen each other for 15 years and once had an unspoken love.  As he journeys down to meet her he remembers a lifetime spent in quiet, honourable service.I don't like period pieces.  Merchant-Ivory stuff usually feels very false and stifled to me.  Here I didn't know what to expect but I was blown away from start to finish.  To say the story is about a romance isn't the whole picture, to say it's about British-German politics pre-WW2 is not the full story.  In fact the film is about it all - but the focus is Mr Stevens.  He serves dinner while his father dies in an upstairs room, he puts his own opinions so far back that he doesn't have any, he is so focused on the proper way to serve that he never finds his own life.  To describe in like this makes it sound very dull, and to some people it may be, but trust me - the story is beautifully observed and has so much going on in the background that it'll keep you interested.  The main reason it works is a faultless central performance by Hopkins.Hopkins drives the whole film.  His face and his speech reveal more about his inner feelings than anything else.  It can be frustrating to see him always put on a brave face and bury his emotions, but once you get his character (a man of quiet honour, dignity and respect - any wonder he seems otherworldly by modern standards) it's fine.  He is fantastic - I cannot say it enough.  His lot in life is moving, but what is incredibly moving is that he seems content to let his life slide by.  The scene where Thompson's Miss Kenton confronts him about the book he is quietly reading is beautiful, truly beautiful - revealing their closeness and the depth of Stevens' heart.  Thompson is also excellent in her role but doesn't have as much screen time as Hopkins.  Fox, Reeves and Chaplin are all excellent in their roles.If the film has a weakness it is that it doesn't judge the rich - even the Nazi sympathisers.  It almost seems to revere the elite - I know they are not the focus but Merchant-Ivory always seems to be obsessed with how the other half live (or maybe they are part of the other half!).  The ending is also a little disappointing because it's quite low-key, but it's very, very touching.Overall this is excellent - I didn't think it would be that good, but it totally blew me away.  Sit down and let this story unfold before you, let the characters develop and ensnare you.  I guarantee you will be deeply moved by Hopkins.  The rather crude message of `seize the day' is beautifully told in a rich tapestry of one man's life.

This is the question that lies at the center of this intricate tale that parallels the goings-on at Darlington Hall within the servants and the diplomats who convene there where Mr. Stevens, the butler who Anthony Hopkins brings to deeper focus, works at -- work being a mild operative, since he has forgone any external manifestation of emotion and personality in lieu of becoming the perfect servant. This, needless to say, is the very trait that ruins his life and locks him up in the gilded cage where he is doomed to continue on even when the world has moved on, without him no doubt. In many ways, this could be a gentler, more touching variation of what Robert Altman would produce in 2001 as GOSFORD PARK with the crucial difference that where Altman's film focuses on a murder mystery and paintbrushes light strokes of colour over a large ensemble, Merchant-Ivory's REMAINS OF THE DAY is a romance tainted with darker, political overtones, the tie being solely the period where England was inching delicately towards war and the old society -- tradition -- was about to collapse to make way to the new way.Based on Kazuo Ishiguro's novel of the same name, REMAINS OF THE DAY's plot is deceptively simple it presents an older Stevens who is on his way to reconnect with an old friend and former co-worker, Mrs. Benn (Emma Thompson), nee Kenton, Darlington Hall's housekeeper. Through a series of vignettes we get to see how it was in the old days, how Mrs. Kenton came to Darlington Hall, how she and Stevens initially did not get along due to the fact that Stevens' father was a sick man under Stevens' employ and was beginning to falter in his duties as the under-butler. However, as time went by, they would become quite a working team, and through subtle hints both suggest there may be more, however under-developed. We also get to see how Lord Darlington (James Fox), a somewhat pompous man, was progressively revealed to be a Nazi sympathizer and would make some ruining mistakes of his own -- a thing not lost on the American congressman Lewis (Christopher Reeve) who one evening, as a toast to Lord Darlington, calls the European diplomats amateurs because they are operating on goodwill and not practicality.REMAINS OF THE DAY seems to be lacking in plot because in fact, it moves at its own pace much in the style of Merchant-Ivory movies. However, there is quite a bit happening here -- it's just not that evident at first glance. Because at its core, it's a story of people caught in a microcosm of the mundane as veiled, sinister events not to their full understanding are insinuating themselves at the very edges of the frame, there are times when it seems the story dwells too long on mediations of characters tics -- for example, the spat between Mrs. Kenton and Mr. Stevens about Mr. Stevens, Senior's forgetfulness over a Chinaman bobble head, itself a rung on the ladder of Mr. Stevens, Senior's eventual demotion. However, this is exactly the way two co-workers would go about in any other circumstance. It just so happens that theirs is the repetitive task of running a castle to the point that their presence is invisible, making the Hall seem as though it ran itself.However the movie is rife with subtext. Hugh Grant has a small part as the apparently clueless Cardinal who is in fact quite aware of his uncle's relation to the Germans and seems to represent an England of the future. He, and Reeve as the American businessman who will eventually succeed in owning Darlington Hall, are vastly different from the traditionalists that Mrs. Kenton, Mr. Stevens, and Lord Darlington are at heart -- even when Mrs. Kenton has a little extra that separates her from the two men, but even she is clamped down by her passivity towards an injustice committed to two German girls (whose final destiny remains unsolved, leading one to believe they may have met a horrible end) which mirrors her inability to truly take control of her life. Where the actual remains of the day would indicate that things would get better, the fact that Mrs. Kenton and Mr. Stevens are unable, maybe even unwilling (at this late point in their life) to truly confess what she had initiated at trying to unveil his inner life through a romance novel, represents the elegant devastation that overwhelms its presence which drowns the movie in regret. Regret for what never even had a chance in the first place even when it had enormous potential, and that makes it the more imploding.

It marks the end of the expansion of prosperity, change and invention of the Victorian and Edwardian eras, that for the first time in history, brought into existence a large, educated middle class. It is the span of this society and it's events that were both passed on to us as a nation, and have had a greater influence on our modern day than any other period. As they were the beginning of the modern era. By the 1930's we come to the end of the rigid class system that had evolved during these periods. This story is in fact all about the servants and is seen from their perspective. Regular working class people, their lives and loves - they are it's real champions. I believe it to be the finest film ever made on the subject, and one of the finest films period. Easy on both the eyes and the mind, it is effortless to watch. And one of only 3 films that I find myself returning to over and over again, more than any others. Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson who have so many great performances, do their best work here. Here in cinema is a display of excellence in the ordinary, and a celebration of both understatement, and unrequited love. We are only observers here in the sense that there is nothing to figure out, and what we observe is the perfect Servant. One who applies himself wholeheartedly to his craft, and finds contentment in doing his job well. A rarity in both life and cinema. I find it very telling that perhaps the finest English film was a collaboration of men from two former colonies - India and the U.S., a Japanese author, a Celt in the male lead, and a screenwriter from Germany married to an Indian, who has spent most of her life in India and America. These are the people that school us in the culture that birthed our own, and so much of modern western civilization. None of them are English.The perfect fit that I think James Ivory often reaches for is achieved here. It is a movie without sex, violence, or bad language, which are often added from a lack of strength, not as proof of it. This movie is a tribute to everything good that is England.

It examines the English class system and the relationship between master and servant, but primarily depicts a life of regret. The haunting musical score provides compelling accompaniment to this butler's unfolding tragic personal life story. The manor used to depict Darlington Hall is magnificent, the palatial rooms and luxurious furnishings spectacular, the English countryside scenery lovely.Mr. Stevens has devoted his entire life to being the butler at Darlington Hall, currently owned by a millionaire American Senator named Lewis, who had earlier visited the manor. The film flashes back to the butler's years of loyal service and unselfish dedication to his previous employer, Lord Darlington. During that time he is shown to devote himself completely to the efficient running of this enormous household and to totally suppress his own emotions. The butler's restrained veneer is put to the test by the arrival of a new housekeeper, Miss Kenton, who is herself energetic and efficient but challenges him with her wit. The pair develop unexpressed but very obvious feelings for each other. Meanwhile, the gullible Lord Darlington becomes naively involved as a Nazi sympathizer, instrumental in British attempts to appease Hitler back in the late 1930's.Anthony Hopkins is absolutely masterful in the role of the perfect butler, Mr. Stevens, his face a mirror of the words he cannot express. He superbly conveys this trusted servant's loyalty, dedicated efficiency, dignified service, restraint, and suppressed emotions. Emma Thompson is equally brilliant as the capable housekeeper, Miss Kenton, who does display her emotions without ever stating them directly. Other cast members include Hugh Grant as Lord Darlington's godson, and the wonderful late Christopher Reeve as Darlington Hall's present owner, Lewis. James Fox portrays the extremely misguided but never truly villainous Lord Darlington.The butler reveals himself to be unfailingly dedicated to his household, overseeing an elaborate dinner party as his own father is dying upstairs. Mr. Stevens never expresses his political or personal opinions, regardless of whether they are solicited. He diligently performs every single duty expected of him, even awkwardly attempting to fulfill Lord Darlington's request to enlighten his godson about the birds & the bees before his marriage. Despite his own unacknowledged misgivings, at His Lordship's insistence he dismisses two maids simply because they are Jewish. As Lord Darlington's Nazi collaboration unfolds, Mr. Stevens concentrates on performing his duties, endeavours not to admit even to himself awareness of these unsettling political matters, and remains unquestioningly loyal to his aristocratic employer.In this movie we have an undeclared romance between two mature people who never once express their feelings for each other, yet their love is blatantly apparent and absolutely compelling. The viewer gets a glimpse into the depth of unexpressed love in Mr. Stevens' heart when Miss Kenton discovers him reading a sentimental romance novel. He is painfully embarrassed at her discovery but again admits no emotion. The housekeeper's entire demeanor conveys how much she craves his love, threatening to wed another so that Mr. Stevens will finally reveal himself. When he does not, Miss Kenton marries a man she does not love. The butler's emotions are equally obvious on countless occasions, as when he gazes at the departing Miss Kenton from the window above. It is frustrating for the viewer, watching this honourable and dignified gentleman constantly put on a brave and proper outer facade while denying his own emotions, whether grief over his father or love for the housekeeper.Twenty years later Mr. Stevens is filled with regret over his wasted life, his misguided sense of duty toward Lord Darlington, a man of disgraced reputation and now dead. He tries to remedy the error of his emotional suppression but alas, it is too late. Miss Kenton is unhappily married but has a grown, now pregnant daughter and her own sense of duty. Even when she broaches the topic of evening (as in the twilight of their lives), the reserved butler still does not declare his feelings. Their final farewell as she tearfully takes her leave by bus is surely one of the most restrained but sad and haunting depictions ever of two people in love parting. This is a superbly subtle, beautiful, and sensitive portrait of unfulfilled love and regret.

Anthony Hopkins plays Mr Stevens, a Butler at Darlington hall who places the up most importance on servitude. Emma Thompson plays Miss Kenton, the head maid at Darlington Hall who consistently searches for affection from Stevens with intolerable failure. The story is a retrospective of stevens looking back over his life as he travels to meet Miss Kenton for the first time in nearly twenty years. It is a reflective story of a man re-evaluating the purpose of his life, his deeds, his actions, and his attempts to address what he sees as his failure of in-action, namely his remorse at having never told those he loves his innermost feelings. The performances are first class from both both Hopkins and Thompson, not to mention a reliable cast including James Fox, Christopher Reeves, and a young Ben Chaplin. Of particular note are Hopkins' and Thompson's reserved interactions. Both are first class at expressing a vast range of emotions, and Hopkin's refinement and awkwardness is a joy to watch.James Ivory's direction is excellent, the camera is often close in on the characters which emphasises the awkwardness felt by Stevens. There is good mix of smooth camera work and some hand held moments which keep the film fresh and moving, not to mention a few great wide shots, look out for the beautiful shot of the English countryside during sunset when stevens' car runs out of petrol. The excellent cinematography is used to its most effective in a scene when Miss Kenton is in distress and stevens enters the room , Hopkins remains off camera and all that can be seen is Thompson's face with an opened door on the left hand side of the screen. The dialogue ensues as the camera remains tight on Thompsons's face, a technique often use in Shyamalan's films.Overall, this film is gripping in an emotional sense, and even for those who are not normally interested in this genre of film should find it a real treat, highly recommended.

Like many Merchant Ivory movies there are many details that can't all be absorbed one viewing. It helps to know the premise of the plot in advance so the going back and forth in time is not confusing. The story is powerful and the story of appeasement in pre WWII Britain is both chilling and fascinating to watch. Makes one look at the butler's job in a different light - more like running a hotel. The Butler's role felt crucial to support the critical but misguided peace talks. The subplot with his father is touching. The screenplay captures both the grand sweep of the larger events and the intimate personal story.The filming, interiors, scenery and cinematography are all beautiful. It is Emma Thompson's best role. Every emotion is so transparent and clear on her face. Her frustration and sadness are moving and memorable. Anthony Hopkins is so convincing in the character that it's hard to imagine you are not watching a real butler. Hope he is remembered more for this role than Silence of the Lambs. The scenes between them are loaded with emotion and unspoken feelings. Excellent supporting cast including the regal James Fox and a well cast Christopher Reeve.If not for the stiff competition that year including Schindler's List, Philadelphia, Age of Innocence, I think in any other year this would have swept the table. A truly wonderful result of the combination of a Japanese author, a German screenwriter, an American director and the top British actors. One of the best movies in the last 50 years.

I liked it because of many things such as its story, the performance of Emma Thompson and other actors/actresses and the atmosphere of the film as a whole.The story of The Remains of the Day focuses on nobility and suppressed feelings.

Both an acid indictment of the British class system and an unflinching portrayal of a man who in the end cannot transcend his largely self-imposed limitations, the film is both fascinating and agonizing to watch and its cumulative emotional impact will stay with you long after it's over. There is an exquisite moment near the finale when Thompson's character bares only slightly a hint of the feelings she has for Hopkins, an allusion to what might have been between them. And Hopkins, in his consummate skill, maintains in both facial and vocal expressions the most non-committal of replies; his face a mask of bland affability but his eyes dark with the knowledge that he is a dead man who has wasted his life. With no outward show of emotion, the scene is devastating.THE REMAINS OF THE DAY may not be a happy film, but it is a memorable and powerful one.

With this film,this approach is the perfect one,centering as it does around a man who gives his entire life to service in a great house as head Butler.As expected,the film moves at a very slow pace,but it is quite fascinating right from the start,detailing the workings of 'Darlington Hall' in minute detail. However,it is also a very Frustrating film,because Antony Hopkin's character is so rigid,so seemingly devoid of emotion,so steadfast in his refusal to do anything that might alter and better his life,that one feels like giving him a slap and shouting to him sort yourself out!.For example,when his father dies,he simply carries on with his duties. He seems to not have an opinion on anything,such as the pro-Nazi goings-ons in the house.Most notably,there is his relationship with the housekeeper,Emma Thompson. Obviously deep down he feels something,and he reads romantic novels a particularly poignant scene,Antony Hopkin's performance being particularly brilliant here,but he will seemingly not say anything,let alone act. It's painful to watch.Of course it's part of the film's genius that one feels such a reaction to the character. Throughout,we seem to learn bits and pieces about him ,yet by the end we seen to have learnt hardly anything about him at all. The film has an appropriately cold and distant feel,choosing to observe events rather than comment on them,just like Hopkins' character. However,right near the end,there is a devastating shot of one of the film's characters receding into the distance and filled with tears,which is all the more poignant because of it's restraint. Get the hankies.The Remains Of The Day is superbly acted,written and photographed,and yet it's a hard film to warm to. Nevertheless,the fact that it inspires such powerful and conflicting emotions raises it well above many others of it's ilk.

For me it is an example of how particulars are used to achieve generalization that touches individuals back on a specific level.  I remember that from one of my literature courses in those ancient times of my life thirty years past when I was a student.  To make true generalizations about anything, in this case life itself, you must particularize--whatever the medium.And so it is that a story which is particularly that of an English butler who has either consciously suppressed his love or unconsciously repressed it--or maybe both--gives us the details of emotion and behavior that we recognize as truthful generalizations that are actually reflective of the details of our own individual lives.  This is in no way would-be didactive art, but actually high art that achieves the kind of communication with the viewer that becomes the viewer's communion with that art.I say unrequited love has been the story of my life without fear of revealing something private, because it is also something that, through this film, can be shared with others.  I have never been a butler or anything remotely resembling that profession, but I have known what it is to be reticent about expressing my emotions and I have known what it is to lose love through the most stupid of fears--love that might have had a chance to be realized through some basic human courage that I somehow lacked.  My ever-reserved behavior won me no wife, but many sisters who love me for being a great confidant and brother.  And now it seems to me--now that I have just seen this film--that I face the remains of my own day, but I still find myself hoping it is not too late.Anthony Hopkins has given a performance that is aesthetically perfect and emotionally profound--his acting has touched me as I am sure it has touched many others.  With everyone else who has loved and admired this film, I must declare my deepest appreciation for the acting of the entire cast, but even as they all shine, Anthony Hopkins shines just a bit brighter.

Anthony Hopkins is perfect in this complex role, the writing isn't always that solid but Hopkins can just make any scene work here. Playing a character that's supposed to hide all his emotions is a challenge, but Hopkins still manages to give Stevens amazing depth. It's all in the little things I guess occasionally Stevens will smile, but you never know if he's really happy or if he just does everything he does because it's expected from the butler. You can't look in the character's mind because he's so brilliantly underplayed. The best scene of Remains Of The Day comes near the end, when Stevens enters the room of a sobbing Emma Thompson. The climax to that scene (or lack thereof) is so fitting and so amazing. This is not my favorite movie ever because as I said, it isn't even that well-scripted or directed, but it's very compelling nonetheless.

His end in life is to assist and complete his employer to the paramount of his capability, and as we grow closer to him, we understand that this was his sole end He let it blind him to all of the other inevitable possibilities of life. Merchant-Ivory's piercingly thoughtful, smoothly crafted elegy for the Stiff Upper Lip is framed by Stevens' excursion to the sea, and what he discovers there. What defines this trip, in his world an odyssey, is the scenes of the past that connect the present, the moments in his life at Darlington Hall that he's truly chosen to remember, which use Lord Darlington's playing host to the world's preeminent officials as a context, in which it seems periodically like hope for Britain is being determined.Bit by bit we start to become conscious that things were not as they seemed, that Darlington was not as judicious as he thought, that Stevens, in one of Anthony Hopkins; many sterling lead performances, was blind to the truth surrounding him. Namely that Lord Darlington, before WWII, sympathized with Germany, and wanted to effect an independent concord between Britain and the Nazis. In this he was not exactly an outright bad person. He was misled, unthinking, swayed without trouble by the devoutness of well-mannered bigotry. He was, as dinner guest Christopher Reeve harshly notifies him, a layman who should've left foreign policy to real politicians.In a characteristically impeccable performance by Emma Thompson, Ms. Kenton is noticeably drawn to the manservant, but he's petrified of closeness, and evades it through an uncompromising dedication to his work. The film shows this in a sequence of hushed, virtually enigmatic scenes in which she advances and he withdraws. Hopkins and Thompson are performers so above reproach that their chemistry, so understated as to almost be invisible, is yet so strong as to power the entire film. One of the most throbbing, and inspired, of these scenes gradually tighten in on Ms. Kenton startling Stevens in his room reading a book. What book? He conceals the cover. She presses him, literally backing him into a corner, grabbing the book to discover it's a romance. She hadn't anticipated he read those. He solely reads, he awkwardly clarifies, to enhance his already masterful lexicon.Does Stevens hold any common human emotions? Very probably, which is what makes his behavior so fascinating and Hopkins so extraordinary, but something has guided him to submerge them. We meet his butler father, who raised him under an unyielding notion of service, so stern that when his father is essentially dying, Stevens doesn't leave his station at a key dinner party.The most internalized road trip ever committed to film unravels, as episode and reminiscence expose one mystery after another. We start to grasp the temperament of Darlington's manners. The lord, played by polished and elegant James Fox is not a mature man. He even enlists Stevens to describe the birds and the bees to a godson who is clearly far from a zoological understanding of sex. Encouraged by Nazi adherents and anti-Semites, he backs international conferences that sooner or later head toward Darlington Hall being portrayed as a conspirator's nest. Does Stevens hear what is conferred at the gatherings where he serves? What does he dwell on it? It's not the servant's position, he elucidates, to pay attention to his employer's discussions, or have attitudes toward them.As the political debacle of Darlington Hall unfurls, a personal one is also budding. Ms. Kenton, disheartened by her advances toward Stevens, in time flees her job. And it's only countless years later that she writes to Stevens again, inspiring his odyssey. Maybe somewhere obscured in the dusk of his dreams, there's the brain wave that she might&#x85; The closing scenes illustrate a deafeningly quiet heartbreak. The entire film is understated, meditative, reflective An admonition to those who keep their emotional lives in abeyance. Stevens has in effect exhausted his life for the benefit of a traditional sense of duty, an illusion of permanence. He has used his responsibilities as a reason for evading his responsibility to his own contentment.

The Remains of the Day is such a film.A masterpiece. Every aspect of this film is as near perfection as it's possible to imagine. Another reviewer here wrote; It also boasts some of the finest performances ever put on film, and To describe Anthony Hopkins as brilliant is completely redundant. His turn here goes way beyond mere acting, and it was criminal he was denied the Oscar at the 1994 Academy awards. Absolutely so. I was shocked that Hopkins didn't pick up the Oscar - his Butler, Stevens is one of cinemas greatest portrayals. Emma Thompson should also have picked up best actress. In fact - it's quite inexplicable that this wonderful picture received no Oscars at all! EVERY element of this film; story, screenplay, music, acting, cinematography is peerless. There is no weak spot.The Novel is a good one - and it won many awards, but good novels don't always make great films - much depends who takes up the challenge of translating it on the screen. But the translation here magnifies the work immensely.Throughout, the story is one of self-denial, the subjugation of ego and self. Hopkins (as Stevens) LIVES this life and embodies it in a way which permeates the whole film. This spirit controls the piece; Stevens allows his life to be controlled by the rules of his role. Although he is clearly a thinking man, he thinks only of loyalty, blind unquestioning loyalty. He only thinks to break out after his master is found to have flawed thinking - which leads him to question, finally, why he made the choices he did earlier in his life. Now realising his own thinking to be flawed and his choices mistaken Stevens elects to try to do something with the remains of the day. It's a tremendous journey.In ourselves we know throughout that Stevens is making, wantonly through actively choosing self-denial, a mistake which is costing him the happiness of his life. Because of the flashback construction we see how this mistake pans out. We live Stevens's mistakes and self-abrogation, we sense the struggle - we see his choices when confronted with them, and because the character is so well etched (and Hopkins so marvellous in the role), we see what could inform the choices he could make. But in fact - nothing informs his decision making, and he doesn't make any choices - because in his mind he can't be anything other than a Butler. His pride tells him that to be the best Butler there is only one way he can be, and that's like this - seemingly cold, seemingly unthinking. Like Stevens - we the viewer can do nothing, we can make no choices, so we become like him - someone helplessly, regretfully viewing his own life. We sense his pain - but never see it displayed. Only at the end when we understand that he has finally made the right choice is there any form of resolution and our identification with Stevens can become complete.This is a film for anyone who wants another view of human choices which determine and describe the human condition. Truly - one of the greatest films ever made.

And that's not exactly a good thing for me, because I couldn't care less for that kind of movies. It's just not my style of movie and I always try to avoid them as much as I can. Somehow, I feared that this movie would be exactly the same, although I knew that it was situated in between the two world wars. But I also knew that it was situated in the English high society and that's what kept me hesitating. On the other hand I must also say that I was quite curious about it, because this movie got such a high rating on this website (7.8/10 after 10,789 votes at the time).In post-WWI Britain, tradition and good manners are still considered as one of the most valuable goods and Mr. Stevens will make sure that his master will not lose face towards his many guests. He is the butler who has sacrificed his entire life in order to serve his master in the best possible way and he makes sure that all the other staff members are as impeccable as he is. But when the new housekeeper falls in love with him and he can't show his feelings and when his master starts close relations with Nazi sympathizers, he finds it more and more difficult to do his job in the most perfect way...If someone had told me before watching this movie that I would love it, I would never have believed him or her, thinking that they were exaggerating. But to my own surprise I must admit that I did like it ... a lot even. This is by far one of the best romantic drama's that I've seen lately. The story, the acting, the directing,... it's all very powerful and compelling and it didn't let go of me from the first minute until the last. I guess it was the obvious contradiction between what he wanted to do and what he was supposed to do and the constant tension in his relationship with Miss Kenton, that kept me interested.Another reason why I liked this movie so much is the excellent acting. I already said it before in another review and I'll say it again in this one Anthony Hopkins is perfect to play the role of the true gentleman. I never got the feeling that he was acting in this movie. Somehow he felt so real and natural, that I immediately forgot about the fact that this was just a role that he was playing. He has always been a fine actor, capable of playing all kinds of roles, but this is definitely one of his best. Also very interesting were Emma Thompson, Peter Vaughan and Hugh Grant, who all did a wonderful job in this movie.In the end this is one of those romantic drama's that could even appeal to the people who normally would never watch such a movie. Before watching this movie I was more interested in the time period it was situated in than in the story, but even when it had been situated in the 19th century, I would have liked it a lot. This is just one of those movies that deserves to be in the top 250 list and it's too bad that it isn't right now. Personally I give it a rating of 8.5/10.

Hopkins has never been better - and while it is easy to see how his portrayal of Hannibal Lecter won him his Oscar, this portrayal of the emotionally repressed butler, who refuses to see what is before his eyes is a better example of acting by far. The word, I think, has to be mind-blowing.There is a scene with Emma Thompson, where she teases and taunts him, eventually prising the book he has been shielding from his hand only to see that he has been reading an old-fashioned romance, rather than the joked off racy book, wherein Hopkins says almost nothing, but his eyes and his body language are so expressive that it's almost hard to breath. To perform this well, you have to be matched by an equal talent - and Hopkins and Thompson had already proved their ability to play an equal game in the previous year's Howard's End. Here, Thompson plays a woman who keeps pushing gently and decorously to elicit a response from the repressed Mr Stevens. Her final push (announcing her engagement to another man) and her defiant, heart-broken reaction to Hopkins' studied non-reaction is a great moment. It's a brilliant film. Fantastic screenplay from a terrific novel and masterclass performances - and for those who fear such things, there is no swooning adoration of lacy thrills or male musculature that is something of a feature of other Merchant Ivory films. Ugliness is allowed into the beautiful house where most of the action is set - and it's a bigger, better, more engaging film for that. Unforgettable.

This is almost always true (of translations, that is), and it applies to translations to the screen as well as translations of poetry.  The Remains of the Day is the rare exception.  Both book and film are beautiful, the book really is a book and the film really is a film, and the latter is remarkably faithful to the former.  Perhaps the book brings more order to the material, but that's what books are for.  Also, since the book is a first-person account, and the film (very wisely) does without first-person narration altogether, the emphasis has changed ever so slightly, but Ishiguro's material is good enough to stand being looked at more than one way.Anthony Hopkins, Emma Thompson and Hugh Grant are accused of having a narrow range; the accusation may even be correct (as I think it is in the case of Hopkins).  But IF the three CAN only play one role apiece, each of them plays that role here, so even if they are limited performers, they might as well not be.  Similarly, even if (as it's often said) James Ivory is a limited director (since I've somehow missed all his other films I cannot say), HE might as well not be on this occasion, at any rate, he has perfectly understood what makes the book valuable and re-created it cinematically.  The film might as well not be an adaption at all.(If pressed, I'd have to say that the book is the finer creation.  But if you've read the book you won't take this as a black mark against the film.)

And no one wears the mantle as well. I would also sum up this movie as one that runs counter to all of the Hollywood clichés and happy endings, because as much as you would expect and want the pairing of Hopkins with an equally supreme Emma Thompson, alas, this isn't a typical Hollywood romance, and why British films will no doubt remain a bridesmaid to the larger, more commercial films of Hollywood. Far from being the clichéd viewing of their Western counterparts, as in life, they often don't have those glamorized endings, instead focusing on the truth of the story, not in monster box office returns. This certainly isn't a chick flick. Or is it? As in many aspects of life, many cherished dreams and fantasies don't always come true, but in this classic ode to good storytelling, the subtle and heartbreaking pathos of the actors' performances shine though as many Hollywood productions fail to do. If you enjoy wonderful, nuanced acting, this is a film that should not be missed.

Anthony Hopkins plays James Stevens, head butler of Darlington Hall, the residence of Lord Darlington (James Fox), an English aristocrat who hosts interwar dinners and conferences for world politicians, including the prime minister and foreign ambassadors. Darlington wishes to appease Nazi Germany, whom he feels was too harshly treated by the Treaty of Versailles. Christopher Reeve plays Jack Lewis, the American delegate, who invades the proceedings to call the attendees amateurs. Hugh Grant, in one of his better roles, plays Darlington's godson, Reginald Cardinal, a news hound who eventually agrees with Lewis and detects the abuse of Darlington's good, noble intentions by the Germans, the intentions of whose leader are not fully comprehended by Darlington, who will later recognize his own gullibility. It is within this context of large-scale moral and political conflict and international affairs that super-butler Stevens toils to keep a good house. Not only does he try, with every fiber of his being, to remain detached from the world-shaking decisions being made around him (he seems more concerned with the return of a chair to its proper place), but he also maintains an ostensible detachment from his feelings (he shows more emotion over the breaking of a wine bottle than over the death of his father). Stevens extends this detachment to his feelings for the housekeeper, Miss Kenton (Emma Thompson), who, compared with Mr. Stevens, wears her emotions on her sleeve. Stevens justifies his detachment by the unwavering dignity required of a great butler, especially one in the service of a house carrying the importance of Darlington Hall. Emma Thompson's Oscar-nominated performance is earnest and superb. Her character, who is considered old by the underservants and young by Mr. Stevens, passes through a range of emotions and tactics she offers matronly advice to a younger maidservant rushing into marriage, plays provocative detective in bringing to light the errors committed by Stevens' father, tenderly comforts Stevens when his father falls ill, chastises Stevens for his moral inertness in the face of his master's racist turn, criticizes herself for placing her needs above her convictions, and, in one of the most brilliant scenes of the film, encroaches upon Stevens' private time to pry into the subject matter of his reading material, while walking a fine line between playful mockery and seductive cajoling. The supporting cast, which includes Peter Vaughan in a wonderful performance as Stevens' father, William, is also superb. Richard Robbins' whimsical, enchanting, hypnotic music is like a good wine somberly intoxicating. The centerpiece of the film is Anthony Hopkins' Oscar-nominated performance as Stevens, a role which requires tremendous inner energy, as we must always see that he is, in fact, affected by events, while the emotional hollowness of his verbal interactions with the other characters belies his concern. The continual bombardment of his stoicism by personal challenges seems almost humorously intentional on the part of the filmmakers, like tourists trying to make a member of the Royal Guard laugh. Stevens, who cracks a nervous smile now and again, never has a real laugh, and never pursues his love for Miss Kenton, until it is too late. Honor, duty, and dignity are the reasons given for his failure to launch, but it seems as though Stevens comes from a long line of married people, including his father, who also worked as a butler and still managed to have a family of his own. There is a fair share of upstairs-downstairs going on in the world of the film, most pronounced in an uncomfortable scene in which Stevens' ignorance of world affairs is used to prove a point against democracy, but it doesn't seem completely antagonistic; when Mr. Stevens, Sr. trips and falls, dropping a full tray of items, the men of stature he is waiting on come to his aid quickly and treat him humanely. The cause of Stevens' reluctance to accept love when it presents itself appears to be more personal than societal. Stevens, deserving of the benefit of the doubt, is more a workaholic than a sociopath, although there is a faint, remote comparison drawn between Stevens' blind obedience and that of the Nazi soldiers whom Stevens' master is accused of throwing in with. Whatever the reason&#x97;a reason that seems to escape Stevens himself&#x97;the unrequited love between Ms. Kenton and Mr. Stevens is a source of heartbreaking regret and sadness for this long-time admirer of the film&#x97;a feeling that lingers after the final, symbolic scene in which Mr. Stevens, after having assisted Mr. Lewis in releasing a temporarily trapped bird, closes forever the window of opportunity on a chance at love, at unchaining his heart, at escaping Darlington Hall to pursue a life of his own.

A sad story after a life of total dedication to your work, you realize that it wasn't worth. During all your life you suppressed your self to leave the room for the job only. And now it is too late. All you have from now on will be the remains of the day, walked through by recurring ghosts loves that you have ignored, all those occasions to be just yourself that you have passed over.The novel of Kazuo Ishiguro embeds this story in an elegant wrapping the action takes place at the estate of a British aristocrat, noble guests come to participate at hunting parties, to attend great dinners, to discuss international affairs. It is the beginning of the thirties, the master of the place is actually a sympathizer of Nazi Germany, advocating for them, while his butler is simply too loyal, too committed to his work, to make a judgment.Based on the novel, James Ivory made a movie that is exquisite. The director is considered as being influenced in his style by the works of Satyajit Ray and Jean Renoir. He had great masters! The two main characters are flawlessly played by Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson. The butler, as perfect as a Swiss watch, as perfect and as inhuman. And the maid, trying to discover the hidden humanity behind his cold perfection, fighting with him to pull out his secret kindness that he is not aware of. And giving up after too many years .The two of them are surrounded by an impeccable cast James Fox, Christopher Reeve, Hugh Grant, Michael Lonsdale, among others.There is an interesting scene at the end. A pigeon is suddenly emerging from the chimney, aimlessly flying through the large room. They will eventually leave it outside. It was a pure coincidence the pigeon appeared while they were shooting and the director decided on the spot to use it. It is to meditate if there can be actually coincidences in this world! The flight of the pigeon inside the room like in a gigantic cage, an unexpected symbol for what the life of the butler has been. Or a reminder maybe, of the maid, with her attempts to make him human and get his love. Or a message, about what their lives could have been. "},{"Title":"The Conformist","Date":"8 April 2010","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" One of the finest Merchant Ivory film's (thanks largely to the incomparable Kazuo Ishiguro), The Remains Of The Day unfolds like a science fiction tale about a robot butler (Anthony Hopkins) who has been programmed by centuries of British aristocracy to dutifully tend to Lord Darlington, a wealthy gentleman with powerful influence over European politics.At first the robot blindly does the biddings of his masters, social constraints preventing him from questioning his programming. He sees Lord Darlington as a God, and himself as a lowly machine who must be dignified and respectful to all those above. Over time the robot suppresses all self-indulgences, feelings and personal opinions, and instead uses vague notions of dignity and duty to justify what is really an existence of servitude. This is a common Ishiguro obsession how humans remain blind to, and justify, the exploitative class based hierarchies they find themselves within. Indeed, the majority of Ishiguro's readers do not even see THEMSELVES in the characters he writes about, and the majority of his characters readily bow to a status quo in return for both crumbs and the remains of their working days.As the film unfolds, we begin to notice that the robot's spurious notions of dignity, duty and honour have brought little value to his own life. His existence would be an unhappy one, had the British class system not eradicated all emotion from this machine decades ago. To feel is to question and to question is to undermine the smooth running of the Darlington Estate, a situation which the Estate dare not entertain. And so all independent thought is removed, the robot learning to associate righteousness and self-worth with suffering and servitude, the very same bonds which throughout history have allowed nations to squander men in the name of specious causes.The robot begins his slow crawl back to self-awareness, however, when he begins to notice just what type of man the genteel Lord Darlington really is. A supporter of right-wing extremists and a friend of Blackshirts (Italian fascist paramilitary groups), Darlington also forces his robot to fire all Jewish servants in his household. The robot complies, of course, but he doesn't feel good about it. He begins to question his programming.These questions are largely inspired by Miss Kenton (Emma Thompson), a fellow servant in the Darlington Estate. Miss Kenton has an ethical compass and a sense of modern individuality that the robot servants around her do not. Hopkins finds her attractive, wants to instigate a romance with her, but his programming won't allow it. He keeps his mouth shut and watches as she eventually leaves the estate and marries another man.With Miss Kenton gone, the robot begins to associate his loss with his adulation of Mr Darlington. The film then likens this adulation to fascist obedience, by revealing Mr Darlington to be a Nazi sympathizer. In a sequence which is ridiculously ahistorical (the film portrays Americans as righteous noblemen who rallied the British against Hitler), the film suggests that, not only do certain forms of blind compliance lead to certain forms of fascism, but that the British class system is itself akin to fascism, and that through the actions of modern women like Miss Kenton, we now live in a better, more free, contemporary world.But wouldn't a better film have turned Darlington into a regular aristocrat, rather than a Nazi sympathiser? Must the class system be linked to Hitler for us to condemn it? This kind of aristocracy, without having to resort to ties to Blackshirts, is already itself tainted, having been responsible numerous, unfathomable injustices throughout history.The film then ends with a bird escaping the Darlington Manor, implying that the robot has finally attained some measure of freedom and that we've now entered a new world in which old aristocratic values have been replaced with personal freedoms, our world now populated by free-spirited Miss Kentons. Of course, in reality, the immaculately dressed butlers of the Darlington Estate were merely replaced by the casually dressed caretakers of Kubrick's The Shining (another film covertly about Holocausts), whilst the leisure class itself retreated further into the shadows. There are few meaningful distinctions between the roaring twenties, when ghostly robot butlers tended to their aristocratic masters, the neo-colonial 60s/70s, and the modern age. The power structures, though now more amorphous, are still the same, capitalism constantly moving toward a form of tyrannic control (most business models are autocratic or oligarchic, becoming (or hijacking) mini-states).In the early 80s, Immanuel Wallerstein, a renowned social scientist, outlined 12 characteristics which he believed were unique to modern world systems. His aim was to show that late capitalism, in the affluent 80s, was a kind of step up from aristocracy and feudalism. By 1989, though, Wallerstein had completely reversed his position. All the presumably unique characteristics of the modern world system were also true of the medieval and ancient world systems. The point is, there was no clean transition from feudalism to aristocracy to capitalism as such. The world of the robot butler never changed, it just became increasingly blurry (there's more old school slavery today than in the 1800s, you just don't see them). Today, no society has ever done so much to raise the hopes and expectations of its population, whilst simultaneously doing so much to prevent them achieving these very expectations.9/10 - Remains was released the same year as Schindler's List and The Age of Innocence, two similar films which it betters. List pretends to show the horrors of fascism, but in reality, as a solution to the holocaust, it promotes three beliefs capitalism (If only I had more money I could have bought more Jews), religion (prayers for the dead) and passivity (Schindler will care for us, his property), the very three cornerstones of fascism.

Anthony Hopkins plays Mr. Stevens, a man who has given his entire being to his master and who allows himself no thoughts or emotions outside of his duties. The story has two major drives. First, his master (played by James Fox) is a Nazi sympathizer (this is in the mid-30s) and is a major force in the eventual appeasement policies that Britain took up before the war hit home. Second, the lead house keeper (Emma Thompson) becomes emotionally attached to Mr. Stevens, but, given his nature, it's absolutely impossible for him to return the affection, as much as he might feel it inside. I liked most everything about it, but I have to say the story itself was my main point of interest. I just thought it was brilliantly written, and I was deeply moved by it.

We see an awful lot of films about bravery, heroism, people risking everything for the sake of others or to Do The Right Thing; the flipside is seldom explored, and it doesn't make comfortable viewing.Our protagonists here are thoroughly decent people, getting on with what they feel sort of obliged to be doing, but never quite having the courage to do what they *really should* do. With hindsight, it seems perfectly obvious that it was a grievous mistake to encourage Nazi Germany to re-arm and become a major player in Europe, however ungentlemanly it was to cripple the country at the end of World War One; Lord Darlington's refusal to face up to what was happening smacks of moral cowardice. From outside, too, it seems clear that Hopkins and Thompson are foolish not to just *admit* they're in love. In spite of this, and in spite of the fact that it seems more and more likely that the characters in question know what they should really do, every one of them is altogether sympathetic. The film is not here to judge; only to probe the devastation that can follow when people allow fear (and a misplaced sense of duty) to hold them back from doing what they should.I started out by saying that in many ways this film is perfect There is no mistaking that it faultlessly achieves what it set out to do; this is serious art, executed with great style, with the two main leads giving devastating performances. Precisely because it tackles its themes so expertly, so convincingly, it is also a rather upsetting and profoundly frustrating film. It makes us care very much about these people, and we keep desperately wanting them to make things go right, but that is just not where this film is coming from.

Emma Thompson is excellent, as is Anthony Hopkins. What fine performances from both of them! I had forgotten that Hugh Grant was in this. His performance was also well done, and understated. Christopher Reeve also had what amounted to a cameo; this movie was made a couple of years before his accident. It's hard to describe the plot, as there is so much going on. Hopkins plays a butler; his goal is to be the finest butler he can be, and one of the best qualities a butler can have is loyalty. Yet, he slowly (very very slowly) realizes that perhaps loyalty, when displaced, is not actually a virtue. Thompson plays the young housekeeper who is very good at what she does, yet she is (by the character's own admission) a coward. The main storyline concerns the butler's unrequited love for the housekeeper, and it is heartbreaking!

Tell that to the Marines, and maybe to the hiflyers of NASA too.Lord Darlington makes his point where he says that the allied victors, having got their man (Germany) on the ground after the first war, proceeded to impoverish the country, taking as spoils their treasure, their navy, their currency and their dignity. And out of the Versailles treaty was born a terrible resolve for revenge in the form of Adolph Hitler. And one can understand Darlington's (and Chamberlain's) attempts to appease so as to avoid the horrors to come. Millions dead and a nuclear holocaust. Was there another way, way before it was too late?Against this very political backdrop a human story is played out (masterfully one might add), about the sacrifices made by obedient servants who understandably do not see it as their place to question representatives of visiting international leaders. Very few servants (soldiers?) today attempt this, and those that do, end up in the brig or serving life without the possibility of parole or dead. Please!Just as James Cameron knew that only a fool would attempt to retell the story of the Titanic disaster in pure documentary terms and created fictional characters for us to gain insight, so Ishiguro, Jhabvala, and Ivory have done so in this story, where we see the personal sacrifices made by those who have no choice but to blindly follow their leaders, denying their right to a missed home life, which still goes on to this day.To discuss this film without discussing the political background intelligently rather than derisively is such a waste of the film-makers' efforts.Hear the Politics, not just the Upstairs Downstairs!

In the manner of first realizing his loving feelings for Miss Kenton, he hides it, and by all means is successful in doing so at first. However, as his life begins to unravel in front of him with various turns, such as the unforeseen dealings of Mr. Lord Darlington with the Nazis and the spontaneous but yet reluctant engagement of Miss Kenton, he is compelled by sudden grief.Clearly implied at Mr. Stevens Senior's deathbed, his childhood and upraising about of Mr. Stevens was one of rigidness and fanaticism, in this case to his duties as a butler. Even his father in his own pain and suffering, with the knowledge of death clearly within seconds, sends his son off to work instead of last minute words with him. In here it is clear that his devotion, although he has in every way, is superimposed on fanaticism. It is here when the audience knows that his devotion is misplaced. He finds compassion and love in a housekeeper but once his feelings are realized, he automatically puts a barrier between him and Miss Kenton. He does not allow himself to love anyone but his work.This magnificent piece of film art shows the eye missed opportunities and the adversities of stubbornness and the absolute repression of sympathy. It portrays love in the most beautiful yet tragic way. Unfortunately for Mr. Stevens, to show any love for Miss Kenton, the housekeeper, was a matter of breaking-the-rules, more stressing, his own rules and principles. For which case he could not allow it, even in the matter of his rules and principles getting in the way of his feelings.In regard to the acting, Mr. Anthony Hopkins gives a stellar performance as the consecrated English butler. His performance is one of the best ever and although his character is not at all interesting but on the contrary dull, he gives it a sense of mystery. He is able to grasp the audience's compassion and care. For the uninteresting quality to Mr. Stevens, Emma Thompson is in every way interesting and additionally gives the viewer interest in Mr. Stevens. She plays the diplomatic and immediate yet humane housekeeper wonderfully. I don't think any actress but her could have brought tears in my eyes at the end. She has that touch and flexibility that brings a likability to not just this one but all her characters.As to James Ivory, he once again was able to capture the true essence to a wonderful novel. He has a vision to all his work and what could have been boring he made it particularly exotic and captivating.With 8 Oscar nominations including Best Picture, 'The Remains of the Day' is a magnificent piece of art.

This is quite sad. Anyone who enjoys history can follow the meetings that go on at the house. Anyone can understand the butler's feelings that he is below these talks and not informed well enough to pass judgment on his peers, nor why he would NEVER pass judgment on them even if he were in fact informed enough. That he can not warm to the care of another is also understandable when you see the total commitment he has to his position. There is, in fact, a very tender love story here. You have to look for it.

But leave that to Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson. Terrific jobs by both of them.The supporting roles are very good as well, by Peter Vaughan (the father) and James Fox (the count) especially. Hugh Grant fails at one point, but this is mainly a problem in the story; I thought it was a little too much when he lashed out at Mr. Stevens on politics, war and involvement (and puts the man in his place) - he was merely asking if Mr. Stevens would join him for a drink and they were good friends on top of that. De conversation between Mr. S. and the man who gave him a ride, was somewhat inane and lacked a clear conclusion... perhaps I have missed something there, which may happen when one watches such a long movie in the small wee hours.If you liked Downton Abbey and have never heard of this before ('t is possible, is it not?) this is must watch material.A big 8 out of 10, once again.

It was shot on locations in England and is a UK-USA co-production which was produced by Indian screenwriter, producer and director Ismail Merchant, American screenwriter, producer and director Mike Nichols and American producer John Calley. It tells the story about a butler named James Stevens who whilst executing his profession with the utmost dignity at a large mansion called Darlington Hall for the Lord of Darlington, hires a housekeeper named Sarah Kenton.Subtly and precisely directed by British filmmaker James Ivory, this quietly paced fictional tale which is narrated from the two main characters viewpoints, draws a heartrending portrayal of a middle-aged man who is courted by a compassionate woman whom he keeps at distance by remaining utterly professional whenever they interact. While notable for it's naturalistic, atmospheric and mostly interior milieu depictions, sterling production design by production designer Luciana Arrighi, cinematography by English cinematographer Tony-Pierce Roberts, costume design by costume designers Jenny Beaven and John Bright and make-up by make-up artist Christine Beveridge, this dialog-driven and narrative-driven story depicts a refined study of character and contains a good score by American composer Richard Robins. This somewhat political, oppressively romantic and conversational period drama which is set on a country estate in post-war England during the 1930s and 1940s where a woman tries to reach into the feelings of a man whom is completely dedicated to his work and where human emotions are disguised by manners, is impelled and reinforced by it's fragmented narrative structure, subtle character development and continuity and understated and memorable acting performances by Welsh actor Anthony Hopkins and English actress Emma Thompson. A dense, literary and eloquent love-story from the early 1990s which gained, among numerous other awards, the award for Best Actor Anthony Hopkins at the 65th NBR Awards in 1993. "},{"Title":"Ein Treuer Diener Seines Herrn","Date":"6 July 2012","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" Although Ismail Merchant was Indian by birth and James Ivory American, and although many of their film-scripts, including this one, were written by the German-born Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, the Merchant-Ivory partnership came to be seen as quintessentially British film-makers. They were responsible for some of the best-known British films of the eighties and nineties, mostly costume dramas based upon literary sources and dealing with the lives of the well-to-do classes. They did not invent the film genre which has become known as heritage cinema- that dates back at least to the late sixties- but are perhaps its best-known practitioners. The Remains of the Day- the significance of the title is rather obscure- is in many ways a typical example of their work, although the action takes place in the 1930s and 1950s rather than the late Victorian/Edwardian era with which they are normally associated.The main character is Mr. Stevens, the butler of Darlington Hall, an English stately home, during the 1930s. (Stevens' Christian name is James, but he is rarely referred to as such. By convention, senior servants in a household were referred to by their surnames alone). There are two strands to the plot, one political and the other personal. The political strand involves Stevens' employer Lord Darlington, an influential politician who frequently hosts gatherings of important international figures at this home. The personal strand involves Stevens' relations with Lord Darlington's housekeeper Miss Kenton, who falls in love with him although he fails to reciprocate her sentiments. (Or possibly he does, but fails to show it).The central political theme of the film is the politics of appeasement. Darlington initially appears to be in many ways an admirable character, kindly, honourable and idealistic. Although he served in the First World War he, unlike many veterans of that conflict, bears no hatred or animosity towards the Germans- indeed, he believes that Germany was harshly treated in 1919 by the vindictive Allies. His main fault is that he cannot understand those who are not honourable and idealistic, and this blinds him to the evils of Nazism; in the misguided belief that Hitler is a trustworthy man of honour he becomes an outspoken advocate of appeasement. As the film progresses, however, his own character deteriorates; he openly welcomes outright Nazi sympathisers as guests in his home, and even dismisses two Jewish chambermaids for fear of upsetting such persons.Stevens prides himself on being a model butler. He is calm, courteous and efficient, punctilious in the performance of his duties, unfailingly loyal to his employer. He regards any display of emotion as a weakness, and preserves an iron self-control at all times. Miss Kenton- we learn late on in the film that her name is Sarah, although she prefers to be called Sally- is equally efficient professionally, but is warmer and more openly emotional.The question the film raises is whether one should allow oneself to be defined entirely through one's work and through one's relationship with one's superiors. It is the same question as the great Austrian dramatist Franz Grillparzer was raising in his play Ein Treuer Diener Seines Herrn. Like Grillparzer's hero Bancbanus, Stevens is a faithful servant of his master- the literal meaning of the German title- but one whose faithful service comes at a cost. In Stevens' case that cost is both personal, in that he sacrifices his chances of finding love, and moral, in that his loyalty leads him to close his eyes to his master's behaviour. When the two Jewish maids are dismissed, Miss Kenton is outraged, but Stevens refuses to utter a word of criticism of his employer, even in private. We are left wondering whether he is simply being diplomatic, or whether he actually does believe that the rich and powerful can do not wrong.When I recently reviewed 84, Charing Cross Road, I stated that while Anthony Hopkins is sometimes regarded in specialising in forceful, flamboyant or monstrous characters such as Hannibal Lecter or Captain Bligh in The Bounty, he can be equally good as quieter, more restrained individuals, such as Dr Treves in The Elephant Man, C S Lewis in Shadowlands or Frank Doel in 84, Charing Cross Road itself. The Remains of the Day is perhaps Hopkins' finest performance in his vein. It is a superb piece of acting, quiet and unobtrusive, but all the more effective for being so. Emma Thompson is also good as Miss Kenton, as is James Fox as Lord Darlington. There are also good performances in smaller parts from the likes of Peter Vaughan as Stevens' elderly father, although I was less impressed by Christopher Reeve as American Congressman Jack Lewis. (Lewis' part appears to have been expanded beyond that he plays in the novel by Kazuo Ishiguro, doubtless in order to provide a role for a big Hollywood name).The film displays the typical Merchant-Ivory characteristics of high production values and a loving recreation of period detail. It is, to my mind, perhaps too leisurely and slow-moving, which is why I would not rate it as highly as some other Merchant-Ivory productions, such as A Room with a View or Howards End, made the year before and also starring Hopkins and Thompson. It is, however, a well-acted and well-photographed movie, and often a thought-provoking one in its analysis of interwar history and its theme that loyalty often comes with a hidden cost. 7/10 "}{"Title":"Didn't know Christopher Reeve was in it.","Date":"17 September 2011","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" Not that interested in seeing this movie, until I found out Christopher Reeve was in it.

The story, the settings, the cinematography, the acting, the music; its all there. It is also successful in carrying on two widely different stories. One is on a personal level and it is the unfulfilled romantic passions lurking beneath the surface between Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson. The other is the sympathy that the English aristocrat (James Fox) carries on with the German Nazis. He becomes more and more of an accomplice with the appeasement faction in England and never comes to realize what the Nazi party really is.The stories are sad. The repressed emotion of the two servants in the English manor is the underlying theme of the movie. The English aristocrat is also part of this repression because he too is trying to serve his country but is unable to ascertain the situation. None of these characters copes successfully with the challenges that life has to offer. They have missed out on life's opportunities.So many scenes in this movie are so well done &#x96; from the opening to the very end where Anthony Hopkins realizes that he too has missed out.. One outstanding scene is where Emma Thompson succeeds in finding the book that Anthony Hopkins is reading. This was so well done with a minimalist approach &#x96; emphasizing that this friendship should have been so much more.The special features on the DVD were excellent and gave a good historical insight into the story. Of course it should also be remembered that during this era Winston Churchill was constantly warning of accommodation with Germany.As the title of the movie suggests - 'what remains at the end of the day?'

Or when he left Miss Keaton (Thompson)leave, because he was to stay to serve his master, those are moments that require discretion of an actor, and Hopkins nails it. In the other side, Emma Thopson plays a strong woman, but unlike Stevens (Hopkins), she can't hide her feelings that well, showing insecurity sometimes, which adds a different personality in the story in a great way.But if you don't care that much about deep and intelligent dialogs, you will be able to follow the story, without worrying that much about what it's characters a passing through because of it's performances, plus the story about the Indian butler is worth the film.Verdict You should not miss this masterpiece, because of its performances and a deep script.

One of the strong points of this film is the depiction of unrequited love, so effectively done. There are also some interesting and complex themes introduced such as dignity, pride and loyalty(shown here as misguided). People may be put off by this film, it is very nuanced and not exactly fast paced, but is riveting thanks to the impeccable performances, sensitive direction and the perfect balance of genuine good humour and tragedy, shown in a really poignant way in this film.The direction was sensitive and as one review I read(not on IMDb) said alive to every nuance, that I agree with wholeheartedly. What made this already superb film was the acting. James Fox, Christopher Reeve, Tim Piggott-Smith and Peter Vaughan all turn in solid supporting performances, but the lead performances were superb, and that's putting it mildly. Anthony Hopkins is simply mesmerising as Stevens, the emotionally repressed butler with an unwavering sense of duty who embarks on an intense relationship with the housekeeper Miss Kenton. I loved him in The Elephant Man and Shadowlands(both of them fantastic films) but his performance here was so good it is by far away in the top 5 of his best performances. As Miss Kenton, Emma Thompson is riveting and really attractive, her delivery is so convincing as are her facial expressions she was so compelling to watch. The look on her face at the bus stop is not only sad, it is truly haunting and it never fails to make me tear up. it stays with you forever, it really shows what a wonderful actress Thompson is.Overall, a wondrous film, and a must see! 10/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"Age helps a bit.","Date":"24 November 2006","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" ROTD is without a doubt one of the true quality movies of the '90s' It manages to create and hold interest without anyone shot, raped, mangled or blown to pieces.

Maybe not historically accurate, but it raises some great themes. The butler is there, he sees the interaction of English and German, but it is not his place to speak up or speak out. His loyalty outweighs any personal opinion he may have. This is likely a realistic thing that happened throughout Europe, and could even be seen as a parallel to today's whistle-blowers. When does our conscience outweigh our loyalty? The film was nominated for eight Academy Awards, but won none. This is due in part to Schindler's List, which ended up winning five of those.

This is also a sweeping love story, not in the sense of physical contact but in the sense of our two leads bickering with each other nonstop which shows blind devotion towards one another. I thought this was a fascinating film, thanks to strong direction by James Ivory and great performances by Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson. Ivory's film is about a butler named Mr. Stevens who served the Lord Darlington in the mid-30's as the Nazis were taking rule over Europe. Stevens is a proper gentleman, but he learns a little too late about the man he serves. He also becomes quite friendly with the housekeeper, Miss Kenton. Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson deliver Oscar-worthy performances in their roles. Hopkins as a proper gentleman who follows proper edicate procedures and Thompson as the housekeeper who does not like what is happening in her household. I also admired Hugh Grant's performance as the journalist godson of Darlington and James Fox as Darlington himself. Overall, The Remains of the Day is a masterful period piece about a butler who tries to stay out of his master's business, even if his master was trying to deal with the Nazis. The film also works as a love story, but in a different kind of way. I loved the exquisite cinematography of the film and it shows what a beautiful area the English countryside is.

It is centred in an English country house just before and after the Second World War, Plot In A Paragraph The film is the story of 2 loyal servants - Mr. Stevens (Hopkins), the butler, and Miss Kenton (Thompson), the housekeeper - at Darlington Hall in pre World War II England. Stevens, a second-generation servant to Lord Darlington (James Fox), a Nazi sympathiser, always performed his duties with the utmost attention to detail. Miss Kenton was equally as efficient, but much more high spirited. They were clearly attracted to each other, but only able to relate on the level of butler and housekeeper. Their affection was only expressed in terms of pitched battles over domestic details.I'm disappointed to see some reviewers call this boring and state nothing actually happens as I don't believe either statement to be true. Although he appears in a limited number of scenes, Christopher Reeve adds a breath of life to this film. Reeve ad libbed the scenes where he yanked off and then threw the ambassador's shoe in frustration, as well as a later one in which he apologised to Lord Darlington for his statements over dinner. Peter Vaughn, Ben Chaplin and James Fox are excellent with Reeve in heading the supporting cast. Hugh Grant (who rates this as his best movie) also gives a great performance in his small role.

The scene where Mr Stevens sees Miss Kenton's silhouette at the window, in my opinion the point at which he knows he is in love with her, is handled subtly but pointedly. Although it is hard to objectively consider the film alone since I had the prior knowledge of the book, I think it does everything right to bring Ishiguro's words to life.This is, undoubtedly, one of the saddest films (and books) ever produced but you absolutely have to see it.

Hopkins is able to maintain his self imposed dignity during goings on that he know are wrong, because he trust and respects his master. This movie is ultimately about how the world of the two does not allow them the freedom to express a thought. Everything is about service; everything is about sacrifice. There is a gut wrenching scene where a pompous English lord is discussing how the common people of Europe are asking to have a voice in the political being of the country. The man asks Stevens a series of very specific questions which would have required incredible expertise to answer, forcing him to reply that he cannot converse on the subject. He is made a humiliated sight, but must go on with dignity though publicly ridiculed. The man then talks about him as if her were a child.

His entire life revolves in duty and loyalty to his master, even when this involves sacrificing personal needs. His emotional and personal life seems totally suppressed while his existence is completely absorbed in running the household and the staff of servants. A description I heard in one of the bonus documentaries (on DVD) sums it up best the room is supposed to be even emptier when the butler is present; how's that for self-effacement?Emma Thompson comes in as a housekeeper and her sense of independence and will immediately clash with Hopkins. The movie is essentially a chronicle of the development of this relationship, their eventual separation, and later reunion after WW II. The two main characters are brilliantly played, with economy of words but each gesture and expression is filled with meaning and emotion. Especially touching is the reunion scene towards the end, seeing how the two characters have evolved over the years, each trying to break out of their past limitations.There is also an interesting sub-plot relating to the political leanings of the lord of the house, who sympathized with Germany in the pre-war years. Many see Hopkins' unwillingness to confront his master's pro-Nazi leanings as a weakness or failing, but I could not blame him for his decision to limit himself to his professional duties. Any regrets he may have later in life are (I think) mainly related to Emma Thompson, rather than politics.Still, the politics lead to many fantastic scenes in the movie with elegant dinner parties, conferences, all gorgeously produced and presented with impeccable flair. One is truly immersed in the life of that society and I have to say, it's a very impressive life indeed. Costumes, sets, everything works perfectly.Strongly recommended if you enjoy fine acting at its best, and especially if period dramas are your thing.

Yet, to say that the film is plot-less would be as unfair as untrue another successful product of the director and producer's duo James Ivory and Ismail Merchant, the film offers another riveting slice of the British aristocratic life, this time during the inter-war, this time for a story even more enthralling because it is told from the servants' perspective, from the diary of William Stevens, the butler.As Stevens, Anthony Hopkins delivers such a solid performance, in all nuance and subtlety, that we can't doubt the man has been or could have been anything but a butler, obviously belonging to a tradition as old as the hills and whose William Stevens Sr. (Peter Vaughan) is another living remain. Stevens Jr. has been impregnated his whole life by this impeccable perfectionism, total dedication to the master, and the dilution of his own ego into work; and to a certain extent, the butler's tasks, no matter how prestigious and dignified they seem in the beginning, turn our to be ingrate as the story progresses.This unfortunate hardship is crucial though as an empathy-builder, we see Stevens with eyes of sorrow for he's incapable to demonstrate any hint of freethinking or independent personality. And the power of Hopkins is to portray a man trapped in the one-note performance requested for his job, in a poignantly three-dimensional way. In fact, the main thrills of The Remains of the Day consist of spotting the little hints betraying Mr Stevens' capability for feelings. One clue they mostly happen during the scenes involving directly or indirectly Emma Thompson, the second lead of the film.As Mrs Kenton, Emma Thompson, the smart and pretty housekeeper is educated and trained enough to see in Mr Stevens, a worthy of admiration colleague, and she's equal to him enough, in the household hierarchy, to allow herself some familiarities. Obviously fascinated by this mountain of coldness, she brings some flowers to his private room and then, something interesting happens. While he almost dismisses the flowers as 'distractions', he politely asks Mrs Kenton to display more respect toward his father, by not calling him by his Christian name. The scene can mislead by foreshadowing several clashes between the two servants, when they are only benign misunderstandings. But it does show that that there is a heart beating behind this impeccable costume and demeanor. And when this heart is about to collapse while the father is dying, Stevens continues to serve the Master's guest no matter what happens, work must go on. This is Stevens' inner conflict, whose paradox is to create a gap between him and Mrs Kenton but in the same time, allows their mutual respect and tacit attraction, to grow patiently and discreetly with the passing of time.But we know that the romance is doomed from the very beginning, the story doesn't leave much for optimism. We know, when the movie opens that Stevens still work in the same manor, that his Master Lord Darlington died, and an American Congressman, played by Christopher Reeve, bought the house. Mrs Kenton left Darlington before the outbreak of the war and got married. The flow of the film conveys an insightful parallel between the romance and the relationship with the Master. James Fox plays Lord Darlington, not a Nazi sympathizer, but an ambiguous well-mannered gentleman who 'understands' the Germans. During a memorable toast, the American Congressman, and future house owner, would call all the assembled European politicians 'amateurs', an allegation that only shocks his audience, but doesn't fool us, not even Darlington's godson (Hugh Grant). The 'amateur' speech, with the same resonance than Churchill's 'dishonour and war' line, foresees the last days of an agonizing order that exploited the guilt of WWI victory, to roll the red carpets to the Nazis. And the tragic choices of Darlington would spill over Stevens' life. Incapable of adopting one defying attitude against his own master, Stevens condemned himself to a standard of life sadly prone to unhappiness and frustration. And it's precisely the kind of life that Mrs Kenton rejected by leaving the house. And her personal tragedy is that she left the only man she truly loved. The Remains of the Day chronicles two separate stories, challenging the solemn and unflappably professionalism of Mr Stevens, and interlocking each other until leading Stevens to a dead-end. And twenty years later, Stevens maintains the same level of mystery. People ask him where he stood for regarding his Master's opinion. Invoking the call of duty, he served his Master the best he could. He deplored some uninspired choices, the most significant being the revocation of two Jewish maids. But still, Stevens embraced his master's choices without being an accomplice. A few years later, the seal of infamy marks the name of Darlington, but not Stevens', yet there's no doubt his heart carries some regrets, and maybe, his unfulfilled relationship with Mrs Kenton is a way to make up for his own guilt.To have followed Darlington or not following Mrs Kenton? Looking back on his life, Stevens would understand the value of regrets, whether it's for done or undone choices, maybe by persuading a divorced Mrs Kenton to go back to Darlington? As a character study, the film is a wonderful examination of lives made of unmade choices and 'what if' questions, as a romance, it happens to be admirably poignant and brilliant, because feelings are so intimate and real that they can hardly be expressed, let alone from a man of such a few words like Mr Stevens. And this is why the ending plays as the perfect emotional pay-off for a film so full of frustrating inhibitions, a light of hope after an eternity spent in the Master's shadow.

Why is he so stuck, and emotionally stunted? Was he born a little off, or had he suffered a devastating loss? The same goes for Emma Thompson's character, Miss Kenton. Why would she attach her heart to someone so devoid of love and warmth as Mr. Stevens? Some young women go through the hot for aloof-guy period, but they usually get over it. And at least the bad-boy aloof guys throw the girl a bone once in a while. Stevens never threw her so much as artificial nib-let. Why would Thompson's character long for this humorless, wooden-souled man for decades? It's not enough to say that they were hindered by their position in life, as Stevens own father was a respected Butler, and thus living proof that one could be both an Butler *and* a husband/father.I don't mind the occasional sad story filled with melancholy and regret, but I like to see fully-formed characters - even if they are not actually fully-functioning people. The movie had plenty of time to fill us in on a few specifics.Still, the acting is great. Hopkins is at his understated best, and Emma Thompson, (from the bus scene in this movie to her reaction to her Christmas gift in Love Actually) continues to kill us with her depiction of a devastated heart.

Anthony Hopkins energies and focus on doing his duty and not allowing himself romance or even to see to his dying father nor to have an opinion on the very important political happenings that were going on in the house. Emma's frustration with his lack of romantic involvement towards her was especially apparent when she was crying her heart out after having become engaged and his inability to reach out to her except to ask her to see to some domestic duty. Lord Darlington played his part well and even he too presented an inability to show emotion and was naive in his political ideas and his remorse came too late to save him.

Yet, despite this, she still pursues him. Was there some obvious reason for her attraction to him?

All I can say is they must be blind. It is an extraordinary dissection of human experience in a real-life setting.The plot is certainly simple. A reserved and doggedly professional butler hires a smart, impressive new housekeeper to help look after a large stately mansion, and over the years their relationship hovers between the starkly professional and something more romantic, but is stifled by his chronic inability to express, or accept, emotion, or to lay down the dignity of his job, even for a second.Anthony Hopkins is just brilliant as Stevens. This is probably his finest film. Making such a character as hugely sympathetic as he eventually becomes is no small achievement. We understand entirely why she falls in love with him, even as we share her frustration at his maddening weaknesses. Thompson meanwhile is no less mesmerising as the emotionally-starved career woman ahead of her time, holding her own admirably in a man's world, and there is able support from Edward Fox, Christopher Reeve and Peter Vaughan among others.Nothing is ever truly perfect, and the performances of some of the minor players can at times be ropey. But that is a tiny fault, and is overwhelmed by the quality of the leads, the tightness of the script, the haunting beauty of the score and the awesome period detail of an England coming to terms with its 20th century decline, all of which are evoked by Merchant-Ivory in what was probably the crowning glory of their collaboration.If you like your films to be laugh-a-minute slapstick, or packed with action, thrills and shocking stunts, this is definitely one to steer clear of.

This was how film was supposed to be in the artist's purest conception. It's a love story cleverly disguised as a drama. Anthony Hopkins never disappoints but he hammers this one down to the floor. His persona and demeanor are fine tuned to the point of being chilling. Should have won an Academy Award. When you fully expect his character to lose control at the most obvious moments he refuses to, almost as if he is messing with the audience, showing you he can take it no matter how hot the water gets or how obvious someone else's affections are. The professional's professional. And Emma Thompson plays the role of the lovesick and heart-wrenched matron as beautifully as she is. Should have won an Oscar too. The amazing part of the story is that both people are too willful (pigheaded or stubborn are much more appropriate terms) to realize that they are hopelessly and completely in love with each other and there is nothing either one can do about it or anywhere either one can go to forget the other. You think almost constantly throughout the film that one of them is going to break ranks and tell the other precisely or at least generally how they truly feel. But no. Every time that one of them tries to open the door the other kicks it into their face and hard. They are so bent on observing what is and isn't proper that they don't do what they need to do and that is be honest with themselves first and then with each other. It's funny how people spend years living closely with someone and never realize what is going on. This film makes several points. People, as a rule, never mean what they say OR say what they mean. They would rather be polite then be forced to tell the truth. And rejection to them is viewed as being more painful than losing someone you love and care about. The having loved and lost rather than never having loved at all saying is used here and I have never been convinced that is even partially true. I think he and she would have been much better off never having to go through this but watching it acted out on screen is quite memorable. Watch it and find out for yourself.

Beautiful photography, a beautiful musical score, fine editing, excellent dialog, natural character development and exquisite settings. And last but not least a marvelous cast of actors at the top their collective form. Anthony Hopkins has done nothing better. His restrained portrait of the Butler, Stevens, is one of the finest attempts at the portrayal of true servitude, without suffering, that I have ever seen. I say, without suffering, because I don't think Stevens suffers. I think he is very aware of what others experience, as far as close emotional attachments and self-expression, but does not particularly covet those things. He is something we don't understand anymore, someone who lives to serve, in the best sense of the word. I also do not think Stevens is a naive person; though perhaps sheltered by the circumstances of his career, he fully knows HOW to find out what's going on the outside world, if he wanted to. Emma Thompson's housekeeper, Miss Kenton, is from that outside world and attempts to broaden Mr Stevens' horizons by forcing him to face what she thinks are his own self-imposed limitations. She is right, or course, in that Stevens does indeed impose limitations on himself, but she also has a hidden agenda. She is in love with him. Perhaps he loves her but that is something he has sacrificed, willingly, to perform his job to the best of his abilities. We might not understand this attitude now but those were different times when the feudal spirit was still flickering in its last days of existence in England. All gone now.I found 'Remains of the Day' to be a fascinating glimpse into the day to day activities in a great house run along the lines of ancient traditions, and it is also an attempt to portray our struggle with ourselves and our consciences; cowardice resulting from fear, breaking the bounds of tradition, love vs. duty and honor and all that self-help sort of thing.The only truly false and ridiculous note in the film is when Lord Darlington asks his butler to explain the facts of life to Darlington's God-son, Hugh Grant, a young man in his twenties. This was totally absurd and I doubt if the most empty-headed, negligent peer ever known to man, whoever he might have been, would have given the facts of life a second thought. Most schoolboys learned about sex at a very early age within the English public school system and by other more sophisticated means at their disposal. I suggest reading books by Evelyn Waugh and Graham Greene for the real skinny on that topic.I also found Congressman Lewis (Christopher Reeve) to be a highly fictional creation. America did not give a damn about World War 2 until well into the fighting action, and France and most of the Continent had fallen to Hitler's army, only then did F.D.R. come to the aid of England. In the mid 1930s when this film takes place, America was not concerned with German aggression. In fact our Ambassador to the court of St James, Joseph Kennedy Sr, was an admirer of Hitler, resulting in F.D.R. calling him back to Washington and giving him other work to do. He was an embarrassment but still America did not act in the interests of England to cut Germany off at the pass BEFORE a war was started. Reeves' speech, therefore, at the great dinner is completely bogus and the creation of a modern author looking back and using his creative imagination to put forth an anti-aristocracy diatribe out of the mouth of Congressman Lewis.The other historical figure shown in this film is Sir Oswald Mosley, though under the name of Sir Geoffrey something or other. He is portrayed as a grim-lipped monster, quite unlike the true personality of Mosley, the founder of the British Union of Fascists, aka Black Shirts. Mosley had a large following among average British citizens of the day and it wasn't until the press and the communists put him in their sights that he was arrested and imprisoned for the balance of the war. Prior to the formation of the B.U.F. Mosley was widely considered one of the most brilliant politicians in Parliament and was often considered as a possible Prime Minister. This aspect of the truth was entirely ignored in the portrayal of Sir Geoffrey who was simply shown as a nasty little vegetarian bully spouting Hitlarian epithets, something Oswald Mosley never did. This isn't to defend Mosley or his B.U.F but simply to highlight the interpretation of history that has been put into the script. So why do I like this film? I'm not sure. I love the house and its furnishings and the activities of the below-stairs staff. The chemistry between Emma Thompson and Anthony Hopkins is fascinating. In the end I enjoy it is a glorified house-tour wrapped up in a well-written dialogue. I don't see this film as being particularly tragic, or about thwarted love, on the part of Stevens anyway. As Miss Kenton comments upon getting hold of a book Stevens is reading in his room...It's just a sentimental old love story. That would describe this film from Miss Kenton's point of view, but not from Stevens' I think. He would have viewed this film as a tale of all the undermining political forces that brought about the downfall of an ancient and noble tradition in England, and he would not have liked it at all. A melancholy and often touching film which is beautiful to watch, and little more.I give this film a 6 out of 10.

Amour was one of those this year. The Remains of the Day falls into the same category. Helmed by James Ivory, known for his moving period pieces, the film stands a few notches above all his previous achievements.I am an ardent Merchant-Ivory fan and Howards End is one of the most exquisitely pictured films and deeply moving within its seemingly shallow screenplay and characters. Remains of the Day is no less an achievement in its exploration of a bunch of flawed characters whose acts are easy to criticize but understanding their inhibitions and regrets, very difficult.Much of the story takes place within a huge country-mansion called Darlington Hall, owned by the pro-Nazi gentleman, Lord Darlington. Mr Stevens is the head butler for the mansion and takes great pride in his excellence and capabilities. And then comes Miss Kenton, only to criticize him first, and then fall in love with him. Not as simple, Mr Stevens gives duties preference and what turns out is a tale of regret of choices and complications in the definition of duty.To sum up a long story short, The Remains of the Day is a fantastic film and is more pertinent to modern-day audience. With World War &#x96; II and rise of Nazism in backdrop, it beautifully explores the lives of people who are more indirectly affected by the changing political scenario. Deep within, it is essentially a story of unrequited love with not a single scene of romance! The film has so much to tell, so much happening that one cannot assimilate the film entirely at once. While the romantic angle takes preference in the final reels, the under-currents of success in career and regret over decisions is loud and clear.Agreed most artists associated with the film have limited range &#x96; James Ivory, Pierce-Roberts, Prawer Jhabvala, Emma Thompson and to an extent Anthony Hopkins. But what wonderfully they utilize their range, churning out gold within their repertoire. James Ivory's direction is outstanding at places and stays above 'very good' throughout. He builds up the tension so well during the conference is just an example of how good the direction is. Rightly noted in Wikipedia, the film touches a lot of themes and each of them translate smoothly onto the screen all thanks to Ivory and screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala.Emma Thompson and Anthony Hopkins rise above the story and direction and give truly heart-felt performances. Their interactions are the best scenes of the film. Especially the one where she is crying within and he blabbers about their routine the next day and the one where she sobs on the floor. I will not reveal what he does in the latter scene for it would be a spoiler but Hopkins is so much in his character that his actions in that scene are easy to empathize although evil in the traditional sense. The scenes of their brief rendezvous after twenty years are truly unwatchable. The film is very depressing and ends without showing any hope of a better future for the characters.Tony Peirce-Roberts' cinematography is strictly functional and nothing compared to his work in Howards End. Every actor gives his very best in the film. Performances, direction and screenplay are of the highest order. The Remains of the Day captures the very essence of its title, thoroughly justifying it, etches out really flawed characters and brings them alive.

The servants of these lords are a species of servants quite different from anything we can imagine and Anthony Hopkins is making the depicting and rendering of this profession one of the most perfect and intriguing pieces of cinema about the humanity of these servants. It is true English literature is absolutely full of models, including Shakespeare though this latter one preferred his nurses and maids insolent and witty. Are they still humans, or are they robots. We will actually never know. They are able to behave and react along the same line no matter what happens. His old father trips and hurts himself, his old father dies during his service, fascists from Germany are roaming around and trying to manipulate the Prime Minister and the Lord his highness and lordship, an American delegate slaps them all across the face by calling them amateurs, his housekeeper leaves him to marry and ends up crying all her heart out, two Jewish refugees are fired because they are Jewish, anything, really anything may happen and nothing will change the course of their service, of their life of service. They don't hear, they don't see, they don't think, they don't know anything, anyone, anywhere and at any time. Never will one single word stand out in the discourse of these servants, not one button be untied, not one shoe be unpolished, one hair stand upright instead of being curbed down. They are automatons that are just intelligent enough to pass the wine around and not pour mustard in the glasses. That world has vanished of course, mostly, and such caricatures of humanity have been mostly erased from our memory, especially since television has produced innumerable funny comedies on such valets in today's world. So why do they do it? To live well without having to think of any problem or difficulty? Anything and everything is taken care of? They are wing props that will never come on stage and shine but they like obscurity, shadow, shade, invisibility? Apart from that quaint vision of a quaint world that has disappeared, thanks God in any religion imaginable, what's left? People who can look on their lives and consider that they have achieved nothing, they have reached no real target, they have been no one, no one of any importance, they have shown no self pride and no self esteem because the self is just beyond that world for servants. Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson play their parts with so much truth and dedication that we even believe after all it might have been a good thing. They would have accepted to be thrown alive into the incinerators in Auschwitz or Buchenwald and they may even have said Thank you, Sir, and I am glad I can be of service! It is all the more poignant and pathetic because the Lord and master was a pro-nazi activist and tried to sell England to Berlin, though he only managed to sell Czechoslovakia in Munich. Any honest British citizen should have resigned when asked to dismiss two Jewish Girls because they were Jewish and actually found a way to tell the public and warn them about the villainy that was being prepared more than fifty million dead in the world.

Finally sitting down and watching the entire film from beginning to end was a fantastic experience. This is one of those films that I doubt will ever leave my memory. I can't stand sentimental melodramas -- this film made me sentimental and I didn't mind, because everything in it is expressed in an oblique way that allows me to feel like I approached the material on my own terms, as opposed to lesser film-makers than James Ivory who often feel the need to direct the audience as well as the picture.Anthony Hopkins as James Stevens, a deeply repressed traditional English butler, and Emma Thompson as Mary Kenton, the housekeeper who prides herself on independence but years for emotional connection, are two of the greatest performances that I've had the privilege to see on film. There are also good supporting performances by James Fox as Stevens' first employer whose sense of nobility leads him into an unsavory connection with the Nazi party and Christopher Reeves as an American millionaire who is Stevens' second employer at the same country estate.Although the film in general could be seen mostly as the story of Stevens and Kenton's relationship, the unexpressed love and the years of growing closer and then drawing apart, it's really a movie with a broader theme that ties the smaller characters into the larger narrative. As the author of the novel expresses on a good documentary included on the DVD, it's really about decisions in our lives that can lead to basically a person wasting his entire life away as Stevens does. Our decisions and actions sometimes arise from our deepest and best nature but can lead to emptiness and ruin, as they did for Stevens and Lord Darlington (Fox).

If you know what some of the English establishment was up to in the late '30's, you'll enjoy seeing it played out on screen; if not, you'll learn as well as being entertained. The relationship between Stevens and Miss Kenton is developed very well. The way in which Stevens comes to realise how his loyalty to what he saw as duty has cost him the chance of happiness; and Miss Kenton regrets the wasting of years in what becomes a loveless marriage is at the centre of the story. But for me, the most enjoyable theme is how Lord Darlington (superbly played by James Fox)genuinely believes that war with Germany can be avoided by working with the Nazis; then, when he realises that he has been taken for a fool by them, is left a broken man. His character is counterbalanced by that of Cardinal (one of Hugh Grant's best performances)who, with the passion of his youth, argues that the Nazis can't be trusted, and that confrontation is the only way to avoid disaster. And in a poignant irony, Cardinal goes to war and is killed for his beliefs, whilst Lord Darlington is left to face his guilt and naivety, and the loss of his entire way of life. One of the high spots of the movie is when,on the eve of war, Darlington presents a lost and forlorn figure sheltering from a violent thunderstorm - an allegory for the breaking of the political storm clouds that led to world war. As his staff run to flee the rain, just as many ordinary people ran to survive a war, and often failed, Darlington is a sorry bystander who can do nothing but live with his regrets. His pre-war guests, for the most part anti-semitic, arrogant snobs, who aimed to benefit from German invasion by collaborating, or from a war by profiteering, are nowhere to be seen. First rate.

And, the dictates of such a position required he keep the strict rules of non-personal involvement with other staff. Besides, he never learned to unbend. How could he? Kind of trapped in his upbringing and environment and the times.But Ms. Kenton was frustrating to me. She shot herself in the foot, as it turns out, with her impatience and intolerance of Mr. Stevens' aspect. She was downright waspish and disrespectful at times with him. Had she not had the opportunity of marrying for what seemed out of spite, she could have had a happy life staying in her position and relationship with the man she preferred - however limited that may have been. As it is, she ends her days disappointed and unfulfilled. There was a real possibility that had she stayed put, things could have worked out for them to get together. The new owner and new day certainly held potential for the difference in their situation. She could have helped him had her interest been less self-centered. Perhaps a lesson. Is it really love to resent a person who is not cooperating with your desires? And, to the point, does it work for you? Does it bring happiness and fulfillment?

Miss Emma Thompson,who for years has cornered the market for vulnerable,wistful frustrated women plays the vulnerable,wistful, frustrated housekeeper who,for absolutely no good reason that I can think of,falls in love with him.

This stylish beginning by director James Ivory (along with his usual partners of producer Ismail Merchant and screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, also responsible for those peerless adaptations of E. M. Forster's `A Room With A View' and `Howards End') typifies the whole of this beautifully crafted film, based on Kazuo Ishiguro's Booker Prize novel.  The gorgeous cinematography by Tony Pierce-Roberts (`Howards End') ends with an equally memorable aerial scenic panorama of the hall and its estate, whilst throughout careful attention is paid to the story and its characters, and not just the detail.Told in flashback, the events begin in 1958 with the butler Mr. Stevens (Anthony Hopkins a stratosphere away from Hannibal Lecter) taking a break from his employ to visit the former housekeeper, Sally Kenton (Emma Thompson; `Sense and Sensibility') to try to entice her back into service for the new owner, ex-congressman Lewis (Christopher Reeve as a typical American, prior to his tragic paralysing accident in 1995) who was previously a guest of Lord Darlington before the Second World War.  Lewis inadvertently touches a raw nerve when he jest's to Stevens if his intended recruit is an old girlfriend.On his quest to reach his old helpmate now in retirement in a friend's boarding house in Cleveden, Stevens has a chance to reflect on his original impression of Miss Kenton and it becomes clear that he realises all too late the missed opportunity.  Stevens' failure to recognise Kenton's love for him and his feelings for her lead to at least two unfulfilled lives with Kenton's marriage to another colleague, Tom Ben (Tim Pigott-Smith), also breaking down.  Although Stevens' attempt to abrogate his obvious mistake after some twenty years is sadly in vain, his reformed character offers the kindly personal counsel to the now Mrs Ben to do all she can to make her years happy for herself and her husband.  This is a salutary tale of a life obligated in the service of others at the sacrifice of oneself.  The film's message is plainly about finding the balance between serving others and remembering the duty to yourself, no matter how late in life you come to realise this. Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson (reunited from the previous year's superb `Howards End') as the stiff fealty bound butler and the devoted housekeeper, provide us with two of their career best performances, painfully involving us in the tragedy of love denied.  The interplay between the two protagonists brings out the nature of the tale to heart-rending precision, shown most noticeably in the scenes where Kenton surprises Stevens reading a romance novel, and when she is found sobbing by him, after announcing her engagement and intention of leaving, he can only insensitively talk to her of a dusting detail that has been overlooked.   The visual and narrative interpretations do full justice to the author's artifice of observing the world narrowly through Stevens' mind.  The domesticity of the hall is observed in minutiae against the backdrop of world politics, whilst the owner, Lord Darlington (a typically urbane James Fox), believes that Germany was unfairly treated after World War I, and is determined to help `her' regain international standing.  The history here patently reflects on Neville Chamberlain's infamous `piece of paper' (Munich Agreement) in 1938 and his appeasement policy over the two years leading to the outbreak of war in 1939 when perhaps decisive action earlier could have altered things.  Ill-informed military intelligence regarding German rearmament was equally as culpable as political and religious (especially Roman Catholic) weakness, as well as the unjust Treaty of Versailles itself.  Lord Darlington's appeasement conferences and his links with Germany, which led to the term &#145;Traitor's Nest' being coined by a newspaper, are also a thinly veiled reference to the Duke of Windsor's collaboration with the fascist regime.  Congressman Lewis criticises the gentlemen politicians as amateurs, blind to the realities of the world around them, and urges them to leave foreign affairs to the professionals. Stevens' loyal servitude is unquestioning of his master's politics (whom hindsight would show was misguided in his pro-German and anti-Semitic stance, rather than inherently evil) regarding it as not his place to have any views.  Both men come to realise after the War that Lord Darlington's sense of honour, along with his gullible nature and good intentions were taken advantage of till he became a dupe of the Nazis.  When Kenton confesses to Stevens of being a coward and afraid of being alone, in failing to fulfill her threat to leave when their Lordship dismisses two German girls for being Jewish, he can only restrict himself to stressing how important she is to the house. Noteworthy roles are also provided by Hugh Grant, who for once is non-stammering as Lord Darlington's godson amused by Stevens' euphemistically vague attempts, under his employer's absurd request, to explain the facts of life regarding `birds and bees'; and Peter Vaughan (his many TV credits include `Porridge' and `Our Friends in the North') portrays Stevens' father as repressed of human emotion as his son, but in his case who obviously allowed himself the luxury of indulging a biological need at least once.  When during a banquet Stevens senior collapses, his son stubbornly refuses to leave his post, in the interests of his blind sense of duty. Although this film was deservedly nominated for several key Oscars and Baftas in 1994, it was, together with Martin Scorcese's similarly themed `The Age of Innocence', and another nominated role for Emma Thompson for `In the Name of the Father', unfortunately eclipsed in an outstanding year by Steven Spielberg's harrowing `Schindler's List', as well as Jan Chapman and Jane Campion's highly original `The Piano'.

A handfull of people that are psychologically completely repressed and spend (not live!!!) their sad lives only to serve others.  Anthony Hopkins, who gives one of the best performances of his career, plays a butler who knows only one thing, to serve his employer with the utmost perfection. His extremely narrow and blindfolded way of existence has made him immune of displaying a single feeling in front of anyone else and after almost a lifetime of rejected living he finally discovers his great mistake. But by that time he already looses the woman who loves him. I must admit I was fairly disturbed with this movie since I thought it was going to take a different direction. I thought Hopkins's character would realize his life was a complete waste and immediately try to change what was left of it. I also thought the scenes where Emma Thompson shows she's in love with Stevens were very scarse and weren't by far enough to convince me that she was in great agony because of his coldness. I presumed she was just angry with him because he was so uptight and unsociable, but I was apparently mistaken.Years later Stevens gets in contact with Miss Kenton, but lets things be, only to disappoint her one final time. So rather that starting fresh Stevens decides to remain a butler, knowing it means rejecting his life for the comfort of others.

Of course Scorsese made The Age of Innocence, Ang Lee Sense and Sensibility and Altman Gosford Park.This is very well written for the screen. It shows that social layering and ranking is always present under the direct surface (although outsiders usually are ignorant of this). What's of interest is not the social niceties, but what isn't said and only implicitly pointed to. When Stevens' father tells Stevens he's been a good father there is no response. The whole Platonian love relation between Stevens and Miss Kenton follows this path and the tragedy being that lack of communication is strangling their lives. In this way it's also an indictment of the class system itself. To make this point stronger their relation is the core of the story but is told against the backdrop of other events in the house.A parallel can be drawn between the bad choices of Darlington as homeowner and Stevens as butler. But while Darlington seems merely ignorant, Stevens is not but pretends to be (hence all the lies when his car breaks down). When Lewis (American) takes over the house a final opportunity comes to set things right and Stevens is 'freed' (the pigeon sequence).Hopkins not only plays Stevens, he is Stevens. For the ones who doubted about the acting capabilities of the late Christopher Reeve this is necessary viewing.Too many sideways in the story make no sense in telling the main story. Part of this is to blame by the choice to tell it as a back story. Also the politics of appeasement to Hitler in Britain could be brought stronger and with more impact. So it is somewhat strangled by its own constructional choices. But the choice to tell this with flashbacks is basically a good one.

Give me Wuthering Heights - give me a nasty horror movie - give me a crack pipe any day over this, a noxious validation of frigidity psychologically and otherwise - it actually stopped me from thinking and is probably morally bad to watch.I suspect racial prejudice here. The British are of course rich in the blood of Shakespeare and every vein in my body bursts in protest against this drivel &#150; spineless, moribund, weak; ignoble in every way. A showing of King Lear (the Peter Brook version preferably) would have made my Christmas this destroyed it. I now find out that the book the film was based on won The Booker. That, to me, is just impossible. It is tripe, even though I've not read it and nothing could make me. No mere trick of style could get this out of the pit it flails within, limping through idiocy and snobbery and tasteless regard for useless things it is gibberish. And it's just so sentimental, so 'unfun' - and it's even got good actors in it! Whatever inspired this film wasn't a Booker prize winner, and whoever was judging should be sacked, or shot, if they're not in office any more. I am shocked. I weep. It's all I can do.

It is quite good for a film about high class living and what it used to be like in the old days to be rich, or a butler. Basically it is showing the butler life of Stevens (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Sir Anthony Hopkins). He has worked at a mansion for many years and his father, also a butler, has died, he is trying to carry on and not worry about his Dad, at least not in front of people. Miss Kenton (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Emma Thompson), a cleaner, is worried that he isn't mentioning him, or something. I mainly just wanted to see it for the good cast. Also starring Christopher Reeve as Lewis, Hugh Grant as Cardinal, Moonraker's Michael Lonsdale as Dupont D'Ivry, Tim Pigott-Smith as Benn and even Coronation Street's John Savident as Dr. Meredith. What I saw was pretty good, but I need to see it again to get it and understand why it is so great. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Director for James Ivory (Howards End) (also nominated the BAFTA and Golden Globe), Best Music for Richard Robbins, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, Best Adapted Screenplay, the David Lean Award for Direction and Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay. Sir Anthony Hopkins was number 7 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 1 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 1 on Britain's Finest Actors, and he was number 3 on The World's Greatest Actor, and Emma Thompson was number 3 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, and the film was number 35 on The 50 Greatest British Films. Worth watching (what I've seen)! "}]
