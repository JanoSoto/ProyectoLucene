[{"Title":"Another classic from Leslie Nielsen!","Date":"27 June 2003","Score":"50 out of 57 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Thriller","Review":"  I read another reviewer's comments about Wrongfully Accused, and I am continually amazed at how many people judge movies like this as though they are meant to be serious cinematic endeavors. Leslie Nielsen's films, literally, are jokes, and if you can't take them that way then maybe it would be better if you didn't watch them. I only say this here rather than just to that reviewer because I think it's worth pointing out that, in case you couldn't already tell, this movie is a parody and is meant to be laughed at. I am perfectly willing to admit that it is peppered with scenes that fall completely flat (the sex scene with the sports commentary in the background is a prime example) and much of Nielsen's acting is absolutely awful (also note that much of this is also a parody of similar bad acting in the movies that are being spoofed in this movie, such as The Fugitive and obviously some of the James Bond films), but again, you really need to keep in mind what kind of movie this is. Besides, there are also plenty of truly hilarious scenes. I can't help cracking up at the train peeking around the rock at Nielsen as he tries to escape, or the scene where he bends down to get his foot out of the railroad tracks and is hit in the forehead by the crossing gate. This scene was also screwed up, because that crossing gate was down across the track rather than a road going over the tracks, and it stopped rising just above Nielsen's head. But who cares? Comedy is a surprise, if you just saw what was expected it wouldn't be funny!I can't say that Wrongfully Accused promises a cerebral workout or any moving social commentary, but if you look at the cover of this movie and expect something like that, maybe you should stick to the kid's section at the video store, because you are probably a little out of your league. The rest of you should be able to find some things to laugh at in this movie. Just enjoy it for what it is, because there are really only two things that frost my butt, a snow cone about that high, and IMDb reviewers that can't take a good joke!

The only movies that might be funnier than this that I have seen were Airplane! or Mafia!, which Mafia! has an even lower rating! This is the mother of all parodies, except for maybe, once again, Airplane! or Mafia!, each of which is hilarious. Stupid, stupid things come together to make a funny, funny movie. I swear, when he accidentally fries that janitor with the defibrillator, every time I see that I nearly p*ss myself! I actually took count once, and I think there are around twenty to thirty different movies that this one parodies, from Star Wars, where the usher has a light saber instead of a flashlight, to The Terminator when the lights are turned on when the villain is wearing night vision goggles and his eyes glow green, to the immortal, Here's looking at you, kid, from Casablanca, this movie really has it all.Really simple things that you most likely don't even remember make this movie HYSTERICAL! From, You're not Lauren, you're an impostor! to the hydraulic car playing La Cucaracha (which, by the way, is another one of my all-time favorite gags), the slapstick and reckless comedy this movie has will have you really split your sides (call the hospital in advance).All in all, if you haven't seen this movie before, see it. Ignore what the IMDb rates it, a somewhat lousy movie. This movie has hysterics beyond belief.

Nielsen is perhaps one of the funniest comedic actors around, though his movies like this are criticized as though they were supposed to be some Oscar Nomminated hit or something. What those drama critics don't seem to understand is that all his comedy movies are PARODIES of dramatic movies. They're not supposed to be taken seriously.

It's true, Nielsen has built a career out of movies like this. He plays Ryan Harrison, the dashing, although somewhat clueless hero who somehow romances a woman half his age, tracks down a 1-armed, 1-legged, 1-eyed man, and saves a UN Member. He does so through trial and error, questionable flashbacks, smart-alec quips and oddly phrased metaphors. And somehow does it in what seems to be 2 days! In the good tradition of the parody, nothing is sacred to this movie. Although it is mostly a spoof of The Fugitive, every movie gets the blade here. Braveheart, Titanic, Mission Impossible, Field of Dreams, it all gets the Nielsen treatment. And just movies, but pop culture too! Car alarms, ER, bras, basketball commentary, and Alfred Hitchock all get their dues. Even the adorable puppet Lambchop can be heard chanting 'Riot, riot, riot!' in a scene.Simply put, any Leslie Nielsen fan will love this. If you hated his previous movies, you won't like this one. It's a rehash of the classic parody formula, a formula that has withstood the test and still stands up. And of course the clueless Nielsen doesn't fail to disappoint. Running from a model airplane, wearing a meat factory coat to impersonate a doctor, using a long wooden stick to deactivate his bear-trap car alarm, and playing a violin with his teeth...He does it all! Leslie Nielsen is without a clue, without a hope, and he's been Wrongfully Accused!

If I had to choose one of the most hilarious, and one of the funniest films ever made, I'd choose this one. What a great entertainment, what a clever fun, mighty pun and a merciless satire on those films that it mocks at! Mr. Nielsen is as usual at his best. His impossibly funny face, his over the place, exaggerated gestures and intonations are merciless stabs and jeers at all those hot actors, who really need to be shaken a bit. The plot is based on several films, and it interweaves all the plot lines so impeccably easily that you have to check every time what film it makes a parody on. The main idea is pretty simple - a famous violinist, Ryan Harrison is wrongly accused of murder he did not commit, so he has to become a run-away. He is chased by an incredibly silly police, and he has to overcome so many hardships - the wild wood, train chase, computer problems, shootout. The clever stabs on Mission Impossible, BraveHeart, as well as Stephen King's Corn fields are just brilliant. You cannot change your breath, so hard your laugh is. The main hero finally finds one-eyed, one-armed, one-legged Irish terrorist, Sean McGhrea, and the revenge is sweet, but you really must see that final scene on Titanic board, when the lovely romantic couple is cruelly hit by a low-hanging bridge. Impossibly funny, really smart, clever, merry and very bold. Excellent film. "},{"Title":"Nielsen saves this spoof from being very bad.","Date":"6 October 1998","Score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Thriller","Review":"  Leslie Nielsen is truly the grandmaster of slapstick comedies. In the new film Wrongfully Accused, Nielsen once more proves that he is capable of saving a bad spoof from being bad. In it, he releases his natural talent of comic genius into his character similar to the one from the magnificent movie The Fugitive(Harrison Ford) and, of course, makes us laugh up a storm.Leslie Nielsen is surprisingly energetic in this film, more than usual. I mean, it's not like him to do some of the things he does in this production. Then again, this is not your typical Nielsen movie in any means. The plot is awfully serious for a slapstick and the characters are too complicated. In a drama movie these things are all signs of skill, but for a movie that just wants to have fun, these things are flaws. Nielsen saves the production by doing what he can with the script.Another problem of the film is that it virtually strained for laughs, to the point of  making the audience think before they laugh. For example, the accused murder walks into a town labeled The Town That Has More Police Than Anywhere in the Whole Wide World.There are some quickie jokes that do work, for instance In a hospital, the intercom speaker says Dr. Kavorkian to Mr. Simson's room. Or how about when Ryan looks over Lake's photo album under the family tree, the father has two branches, her dad and Bill Clinton. The funniest When Harrison makes the jump from the dam, from Fugitive you here the title song from Baywatch and see a group of attractive young lifeguards race to site. The US marshals shoot machine guns at the criminals' feet making them do an Irish dance.Wrongfully Accused is the summer's second spoof movie. First along came the lame Mafia, which didn't work because there were no main characters. To have Leslie Nielsen on your team when you're making a spoof, that's an almost certain success even if the film on its own is bad, like this movie. In other words, if this movie was absent of him and was still released in theaters it should have been called Wrongfully Released.

That may not sound like much to begin with, but when you see how these spoofs are woven into the story, you'll be laughing your socks off in no time. Also the way they transform these spoofs is fantastic as well, changing the overbearingly large Bi-plane from North by Northwest into an RC model, and having Leslie Nielsen's character washing and polishing the van during a ripped off version of the Blockade scene from Clear and Present Danger. On top of that, the acting is very good as well, with Leslie Nielsen playing the wrongfully accused Ryan Harrison, a man on the run for the murder of a rich statesman who was in fact killed as part of a Terrorist Insurtion. The story is you're basic sort of thing, ripping off the story of the Fugitive mainly, but other than that, it's the humour you've got to keep an eye out for. I recommend it to everyone!

With films such as Epic Movie, Superhero Movie and Disaster Movie, it has become easy to see why this genre is mostly seen as feeble, with even weaker reviews to support it.Wrongfully Accused however is one of the very few spoof films that are worth giving a second look. Leslie Nielsen lends his natural parody mindset to this 1998 spoof of The Fugitive, as well as a cleverly delivered collection of other films such as Braveheart, Mission Impossible and Titanic. Ryan Harrison (played by Nielsen) has been, as the title states, wrongfully accused. Of murder that is. While running from the police, led by Lieutenant Fergus Falls (portrayed by Richard Crenna of Rambo fame), Harrison manages to not only escape from execution, but also disguise himself as a gardener, a fisherman named Buzz'n Frog, and a doctor, while acting as a private detective himself in an attempt to stop the killing of Sir Robert McKintyre from those who have framed him.As a Leslie Nielsen fan who appreciates his unique and natural sense of humor and expression, I would say Wrongfully Accused is one of his best films &#x96; a winner in not only the spoof genre, but in the comedy world as a whole. The greater your knowledge of films, the more you will appreciate this movie. Wrongfully Accused boasts many memorable quotes and hilarious scenes which never lose their flavor, and will put a smile on the faces of the whole family, young and old. Although it lacks blockbuster special effects and a strong original storyline, I feel it is a true comedy classic worth nothing less than 8 out of 10.

He is in search of the one eyed, one armed, one legged man who committed the murder. He is periodically joined by Kelly Le Brock. Pure formula with director Pat Proft doing his best at setting up sight jokes but story is thread bare. Nielsen's role is recycled from his superior work in The Naked Gun films yet he still maintains a level of straight face humour that works to his favour as he struggles to clear his name. Le Brock is basically a cardboard romantic prop who serves little purpose. Richard Crenna has the standard role of police inspector who is only scarcely funny. Michael York is wasted in a role he probably received right after his deadpan role in Austin Powers International Man of Mystery. Melinda McGraw is cast as the possible mistress to the York character but the character never develops beyond the 007 reference. Like Spy Hard the premise is all spoof reciting its lead. This can be funny, and Nielsen still rises above it despite the fact that it is lower level work.

But so what? It's all in good fun. It was actually better than I'd expected.There are at least five bright spots that make this film worth watching Richard Crenna's masterful parody of Tommy Lee Jones character in The Fugitive, a host of memorable one-liners, watching an aging Leslie Nielson nail yet another physically-demanding dead-pan performance, counting the number of famous films being parodied, and a scene featuring a particularly hilarious low-rider.

During his concert tour in Columbia Heights, Minnesota, Lauren Goodhue(Kelly LeBrock), wife of his sponsor, billionaire businessman Hibbing Goodhue(Michael York), falls for him in the worst possible way. When Harrison refuses her advances, he finds himself in a rut when lured to the Goodhue house to find Goodhue dead and himself the prime suspect. Found guilty of murder and  sentenced to death by four brutal methods at once(which you can only get away with in a spoof film), a bus/train crash give Harrison a chance to ecsape and clear his name.

Because Nielsen's presence doesn't automatically stand for good spoof. In fact, there are quite a few movies starring him that were plain bad(Mr. Magoo, Dracula).When I first saw 'Spy Hard' (I know that this is a Wrongfully Accused review, don't worry), I thought it was a fine comedy. During my second viewing though, I noticed the movie's one great flaw the jokes weren't funny anymore. And even worse, I didn't find any new jokes that I hadn't heard before. It was all the same. And not funny. Not any more.Another bad thing about the 'new generation spoof' that I should note is the abundance of visual jokes in sacrifice of good dialogue. This isn't a bad thing when it comes to the visual jokes of course, but one of the great strengths of for instance 'The Naked Gun', was it's superb dialogue, and the way the lines were delivered by the cast.So, what does this all say about Wrongfully Accused? Well, it's in fact better than I thought it would be, but in no way up to the Airplane/Naked Gun-standard. I doubt if a second viewing would reveal anything new to me. It really is more of a Leslie Nielsen movie than a true-hearted, superbly executed spoof movie, but it's worth a try.

Numerous sequels and similar type movies later, one has to question why they are still made.  Yes there are some funny momements, but overall the movie is a tired attempt at humour that really offers nothing new to the audience.This time Leslie Nielsen plays Ryan Harrison who has been wrongfully accused of a murder he did not commit.  The basis of the script is to parody the Fugitive.  This it does effectively at times.Richard Crenna as Lt Fergus Falls plays the Tommy Lee Jones role here.  I find Crenna to be somewhat annoying (I suppose this is exactly what he is supposed to be).  Unfortunatley I didn't find it funny.Kelly LeBrock remains a true beauty (the cigar scene would make Bill Clinton recall some moments best forgotten).  Her role is that of the scheming adultress who orchestrates her husband's (Michael York)murder.Leslie Nielsen fans will undoubtedly love this movie.  I actually like Nielsen, however too many movies of the same vain have now stereotyped him in to these type of roles on a permanent basis.

When Ryan comes to, Hibbing is dead and Ryan is holding the murder weapon.We don't see the trial, but despite being wrongfully accused, Ryan is sentenced to death row. Fortunately, there is a sequence corresponding to the train wreck in The Fugitive. At first, it looks only slightly more realistic than the bus jump in Spice World--and that's not saying much. What happens next, though, is hilarious, and it works better if you don't know what's coming.The chase is on! Lt. Fergus Falls is the most brilliant and the most thorough detective in the history of crime, with amazing technological capabilities allowing him to find out anything and everything that could be the least bit relevant to locating and arresting Ryan. But will that be enough?Some gags worked, while others did not. One gag that did work involved a defaced wanted poster. I do remember so many hilarious moments in a short period that I laughed until I cried.

Mission Impossible was obvious--and the security system in the scene was obviously designed by Jews. I also noticed Dirty Harry, Titanic and Field of Dreams were parodied.Leslie Nielsen didn't quite achieve the masterful performances from the Airplane and Naked Gun movies, but I enjoyed his work anyway.

That's because it was written and directed by Pat Proft, who earlier in his career had worked with the ZAZ team on the Naked Gun movies. I felt that maybe he had learned something with these guys on how to make a spoof movie.Indeed, the movie is jam-packed with gags just like the ZAZ movies. With that in mind, it is inevitable that at least a few gags would work. Yes, there are some moments that made me chuckle... but just a few. Most of the gags simply don't work. There is often an air of desperateness with the gags, as if Proft threw in every gag that first came into mind without considering if each gag was truly funny or not. But Proft doesn't just stumble with the gags. He makes the mistake of not making Leslie Nielsen's character a fully fleshed-out character. When Nielsen's character is arrested, we have been given little to make us care about his character. Nielsen does give a gung ho performance (and so does Richard Crenna), but the two actors have little to make characters.Though a lot of energy was put into this movie, it feels all the same tired and worn out. I think that the spoof movie genre has to be shelved for a long time until some new and fresh comic talent comes out who could revive it successfully.

The humor works & it's lead-star, the amazing Leslie Nielsen, does exceedingly well.'Wrongfully Accused' Synopsis Ryan Harrison is framed for murder and must prove himself innocent by finding a mysterious one-eyed, one-armed, one-legged man after escaping from a bus accident on the way to jail.'Wrongfully Accused' is a parody of the 1993 film The Fugitive, And I must say, this parody is funny. The First-Hour is superb & raises a lot of laughs, the Second-Hour drags a bit, but sails off smoothly. Pat Proft's Screenplay & Direction, both, are wild & confident. Cinematography is fine. Performance-Wise Leslie Nielsen does exceedingly well in the central role. The late actor once again plays poker-face & raises a lot of genuine laughs. Richard Crenna is fantastic. Kelly Le Brock is ordinary. Melinda McGraw, Michael York & Sandra Bernhard, lend support. On the whole, If you're a fan of parodies, then 'Wrongfully Accused', should be in your agenda.

In fact there have been other films (Loaded Weapon 1) which try to copy Nielson's form of comedy and fall flat.  And its sad to report that in this film Nielson actually does fall flat.None of the jokes worked for me.  Yes, its a parody of the Fugitive (as well as Mission Impossible and other films), but it doesn't work, it doesn't have the same appeal as the Naked Gun films or Airplane.  The flow is very slow, the jokes predicatable and unworkable.Nielson does try hard, but it doesn't seem to pay off.  Its barely laughable at times, and that is a crying shame.Perhaps, as Nielson is starting to find out, your only as good as your last performance - unfortuently his previous films (Mr Magoo, Spy Hard, etc) haven't paid off.  Perhaps he needs to go back to doing classical acting and find something new?Overall this is a pretty lame film.

Witness comedy veterans Jim Abrams (who recently missed with Mafia!) and Leslie Nielsen whose movies have gradually declined in quality to a point where I wonder how long he can keep making these bombs.The test of any comedy is, did you laugh? With Wrongfully Accused about one out of every four jokes made me chuckle. Meaning there were long stretches where the film simply wasn't funny.Why? I blame it on the script mostly. The plot was too complicated. Some jokes were much too obvious. The direction also just did not have a good comic feel. Except for an ok run away train sequence, Wrongfully Accused should be fast forwarded or rewound and given back to the video store. While you're there I'd suggest renting the Hot Shots or Naked Gun movies instead.

It used to be in such top form...for comic geniuses like the Zucker Brothers, Jim Abrahams and Pat Proft used to churn out th most reliably hilarious movie spoofs ever!  I am a big fan of  AIRPLANE! , NAKED GUN 2 1/2 THE SMELL OF FEAR, and  HOT SHOTS! ...All of these movies were hysterical as the actors like Leslie Nielsen and Charlie Sheen played their characters straight and generated so much laughs through hilarious dialogue and cool sight gags. The Zucker Brothers, along with Jim Abrahams and Pat Proft, were the only ones who could pull it off.  We've seen horrible imitations, even ones with Leslie Nielsen in it, like  SPY HARD!  and  SILENCE OF THE HAMS! , and any post SPACEBALLS Mel Brooks movie.  Even the recent Zucker Efforts like  HIGH SCHOOL HIGH!  and  MAFIA!  are in no way as funny as their other works.  And now Pat Proft, who teamed up with Jim Abrahams for  HOT SHOTS!  and the NAKED GUN movies..goes solo and writes/directs this new spoof of THE FUGITIVE. And what a horrible disappointment it is.      Leslie Nielsen is a hilarious actor. He knows how to play a character totally in a serious tone in movie parodies..but somehow ..if he isn't in his Frank Drebin persona..he just doesn't work.  He just isn't funny as the wrongfully accused fugitive Ryan Harrison.  I guess the writing just sucks. There are a lot of sight gags in this movie. In fact, every second there is a sight gag. But all of them bomb. Not one succeeds.   I thought Pat Proft was just as good a screenwriter as the Zuckers were but he doesn't show it here. This movie is completely devoid of anything original or funny. Its like dead air. It's depressing to watch.         This movie parody of the FUGITIVE is totally outdated. THE FUGITIVE came out seven years ago. It would be nice to see a movie spoof that pokes fun at much more recent dumb Hollywood trends. Well, I hope one day the directors will all reteam and do something that is as funny and riotous as there Kentucky Fried Movie!  and  AIRPLANE!  days because they've disappointed me a lot lately.

There is nothing wrong with the subject matter chosen for spoofing, but the poor jokes and performances sink this film. Leslie Nielsen is still a very talented performer when given the right material, but in this film he stinks. I hope Nielsen chooses his roles carefully in the future, as his track record over the past few years has been woeful. If he must continue making spoofs, then the only one he should consider is Naked Gun 444 1/4, which would probably be half decent.

It was a movie that was intended to be bad. That's a lot more honest than Borat, which pretended to be about something. The vulgarity and crudeness in Wrongfully Accused was at least tamer and less repugnant than in Borat. At some point, the movie did get funny for awhile. I thought the Mission Impossible computer scene was hilarious. I was rolling on the floor. The movie was bad, but at least it mocked it's badness.

But as I said these are overshadowed by the misses.Neilson is the king of spoof, but even he seems unconvinced by this - the rest of the cast are too earnest and it's embarrassing to see them playing straight to this material.
