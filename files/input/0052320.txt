This is one of my all time favorite sci-fi movies which combines great acting with tight direction and a wonderful claustrophobic atmosphere. Forrest Tucker is in top form, barking out orders and taking control of a desperate situation facing the village. It's fun to watch his on-screen character as his motions and gestures belie his get-tough attitude when it comes to dealing with the nature of the gruesome deaths which face the villagers. One or two inside jokes might sail past most viewers (one that comes to mind is at the very beginning of the film when one mountain climber shouts to the other, who is it Jim, the Abominable Snowman?, referring to Forrest Tucker's 1957 film.) One wonderful, often overlooked scene also occurs early in the film when the group meets for a drink prior to the two climbers going up the mountain. The scene centers around a discussion of roping and really sets up the atmosphere for what is to come-- it's a wonderfully done scene. By today's standards, the special effects may not hold up well, but given all the other positive factors which surround this production, the film stands as a tribute to 1950's sci-fi/horror.

Be forewarned - my view of this film is definitely colored by my unhealthy interest in these films. This is a true archetypal classic of the genre. *** Weird psychic sisters, *** alien mystery clouds, *** giant creeping cyclopes with tentacles, *** secret government agencies investigating the paranormal, *** possession, *** zombies, ***Forest Tucker(!) - it's all here. This is a very entertaining low-fi, low-brow, B/W monster movie. I am convinced that the writers were asked to include every element of contemporary supernatural, sci fi and imaginative fiction stories and, kudos to them - they pulled it off! Stephen King's Dreamcatcher owes a huge debt to this beauty. If you think about it, Dreamcatcher is almost a rewrite of this film, with aliens that are just a little less ridiculous and a different narrative. And the biggest surprise of all - Forest Tucker can act! His F Troop character was not the only personality in his repertoire!Remarkably, the absurdity of the plot is not used as an excuse for exceedingly bad special effects.This is a little gem of a 50s pulp film. It's goofy as hell, fun, well executed, and well worth a sleepless night. Far more entertaining that the Creature from the Black Lagoon, and many others.

Most people just pass it off as another bad 50's sci-fi flick. You want bad? See THE CRAWLING HAND or BRIDE OF THE MONSTER. The plot, adapted from the BBC teleserial, brings our attention to Forrest Tucker an American who bears a striking resemblance to Paul Birch. Anyway, he meets a touring telepathic sister act including Jennifer Jayne and Janet Munro (star of plenty of Disney flicks; and mother of Caroline Munro?). After stopping at a small town in Switzerland called Trollenberg, Forrest goes up to a secret lab and meets a goofy German scientist, in which he reveals he came to this place to study a radioactive, stationary cloud. What's inside? Well, if you can't tell from the title, there's no hope for you. In terms of acting, suspense, and writing (courtesy of Hammer regular Jimmy Sangster), this film holds up pretty well today. But the effects are mediocre, but cool-looking; the eyes emit a cool sound when attacked. But there are some stretches of belief Forrest doesn't act like he knows what the cloud is, and yet later we find out he dealed in a similar experiment in The Andes! But some creepy moments later make up for this, like the beginning sequence, in which the group of students find their friend headless. (But how could he scream when he was falling if his head was already chopped off? Oh Well.)Still, this film does make for some funny spoofs, like the imitation on the cartoon FREAKAZOID and being notable as the first movie ever made fun of by MST3K.

Story here is about a mysterious cloud that is around a mountain in the Swiss village of Trollenberg and it seems to have a connection to the recent deaths of climbers in the area. Staying at the local inn is a United Nations science investigator named Alan Brooks (Forrest Tucker) who seems to know more than he's letting on as he talks in secrecy with professor Crevett (Warren Mitchell) who is the scientist in charge at the research station.*****SPOILER ALERT***** Also at the inn are Sarah Pilgrim (Jennifer Jayne) and her telepathic younger sister Anne (Janet Munro) who experiences bad dreams and visions concerning the weird goings on. When it appears that aliens are inside the cloud and descending down upon the village they want to kill Anne because her ESP is a threat to their existence and Alan and the others must protect her. Inside the cloud the aliens are giant eyeballs with tentacle like arms and they try to kill everyone inside the research station but professor Crevett and Alan figure out that they can combat them with fire and they call the nearest Air Force base to come and drop fire bombs.This is directed by Quentin Lawrence who was a pretty good television director and the idea for this film came from The Trollenberg Terror which was a British TV show that Lawrence was involved with. While the special effects in the last 15 minutes hamper the credibility of this film this is still a well made science fiction effort written by Hammer regular Jimmy Sangster. Some of the shots have an obvious screen behind the actors but there is some impressive cinematography by Monty Berman who does deliver some good looking scenes around the village. The actors do a good job in that they don't over do it and a case can be made that Tucker's character is a bit too subdued but he gives the film a sense of calmness that convinces the viewer that he knows what he's doing. One can't help but notice how much of a presence Munro had even in an early role like this and with her crooked front tooth and her Angelina Jolie lips she bears a resemblance to Leslie Caron. The main premise of the story reminded me of both Island of Terror and Night of the Big Heat which were two Hammer films that dealt with characters trapped someplace battling invading alien forces and the English made several films like this. While this surely won't be thought of as a sci-fi classic (and some of the effects are downright cheesy) it's still a well written and acted film that has some genuinely creepy moments and is a lot of fun to watch.

Produced in the atmosphere of the dawning nuclear age it was a pioneering effort, speculating on the possibility of life on other worlds. Special effects at the time were limited for the most part to chocolate syrup for theatrical blood and scaled miniatures and backdrops to add depth to a studio scene, and silly rubber costumes. The fact that the monsters seem a little artificial shouldn't spoil this film for anyone.The storyline is quite brilliant for the era. Xenobiology and serious scientific speculation on the nature of life, what form it might take, how it might look, didn't exist yet. We had only our imaginations and the understanding that life on other worlds would likely be very different... a huge bulbous brain/eye with tentacles, was as valid at that time as any other guess, and it was creepy, gross, and unexpected. What the Crawling Eye was NOT, more than anything else... was a monster that looked like some poor guy dressed up in 50 pounds of latex.Comments by scientific giants of the day that discounted the notion that intelligent life was unique to Earth as hubris, became the seed for the wonderful Sci-fantasy stories that followed. The possibility that we might not really be alone, but drama requires a villain. The bigger the threat, the greater and more dramatic the effort required to overcome it.We had just finished a horrible world war, Russia had gone from our ally to our most powerful enemy almost overnight, unrest stirred in Asia as Korea was embroiled in civil war and we replaced these threats in cultural fiction with much more fearful threats. More terrible than Hitler and Stalin combined, alien life with advanced technologies beyond our understanding, space flight, tremendous intellect, and inhuman evil provided the antagonist. Once again the Earth was saved not by brilliance, or super weapons, but by heroism, stalwart character, and the refusal to submit to tyranny... The paragon of western values. Our fictional monsters had to be more horrible than life, because we'd already beaten Hitler... and we really had to dig down into our imaginations to find something more evil, more cunning, and more horrible to defeat... We found it for the moment in a tentacled abomination with one huge eye and the force of will to control men's thoughts, even onto death.I suggest a large box of popcorn, a soda in a too large leaky paper cup and more ice than necessary, and a bit of gum or a milk-dud stuck to the seat for the full effect.

This effective British thriller offers one of the most original monsters ever.  The creatures are aliens looking to colonise our planet but first they have to lower the temperature and eliminate one small obstacle . . .us!  The cyclopean, tentacled terrors are prone to tearing off the heads of their victims but they possess the technology to kill certain Earth people and bring them back from the dead to do their bidding.    Interestingly, the creatures brain waves are easily intercepted by anyone with even latent psychic abilities.  This makes Janet Munro our required damsel-in-distress from not only the monsters but from the man (Andrew Faulds) they reanimate to get rid of her.  Luckily this movie has two heroes, rough hewn Forrest Tucker (to make the movie appealing to American audiences) and British Lawrence Payne (later to star in Hammer's VAMPIRE CIRCUS).    Okay I have a question.  Midway through the film we see 2 mountain climbers, Brett and Dewhurst, halfway up the mountain where the aliens are.  They take shelter in a small cabin.  During the night Brett hears the aliens telepathic call and wanders up the mountain alone.  Later Dewhurst gets up to look for him and (I guess) sees one of the aliens  coming toward the cabin.  He quickly bolts the door but then turns around and screams.  Later a search party has to break down the front door and they find Dewhurst dead with his head torn off.  WHAT THE HECK GOT HIM?  The cabin is intact, not even a window broken, so how in the world did the alien monster kill him?  And how does Dewhurst's head get inside the knapsack of Brett who is miles away?  No, it isn't Brett who kills him because he could not have gotten into the cabin either.  It is indeed a scary moment but very implausible if you stop to think about it.    The rest of the movie is very good and quite memorable.  Way back in 1957 it played on a double bill with THE STRANGE WORLD OF PLANET X (a/k/a COSMIC MONSTERS) in America.  That was a bit before my time and now I am kind of sorry I missed the era of the drive-in.  Thank goodness for home video. "},{"Title":"Lot's Of Fun!

As the bodies start to pile up and various climbers go missing on the mountain, the United Nations send a boffin to help the local scientists to hopefully solve the mystery.The effects work has been the source of some disdain, and in truth it's poor but not the worst from the 1950s pantheon of B schlockers. The back projection scenes are crude, but again in keeping with the fun aspects of the genre and era. However, Jimmy Sangster's screenplay is tight and produces brainy conversations and strong sequences.Horror comes by way of headless bodies turning up and that once sane people turn into maniacs as the terror weaves its magic. On the normal human side the narrative is given a boost by Janet Munro's (excellent) telepathic darling, something which troubles the visitors greatly and puts her in grave danger. The psychological aspects of the story mark this out as a genre piece of worth.Elsewhere director Quentin Lawrence does a study job with what is available to him, Forest Tucker is the hero in waiting, playing it reserved like, and Warren Mitchell proves good foil for Tucker and the Terror!

In the film, sturdy as always Forrest Tucker plays Alan Brooks, a U.N. physicist/investigator (or something on that order...after two recent viewings, I'm still not clear on that point) who comes to the Swiss village of Trollenberg to investigate a recent string of mysterious deaths, as well as the radioactive, stationary cloud that hovers over a nearby mountain. Viewers must wait a full hour before getting a look at the title creatures, during which time they should be amply entertained by the plight of Janet Munro's character--a pretty young woman who is in telepathic contact with the creatures--and by the zombie cat's-paw who is sent by the unseen foes to do their bidding. The viewer's patience is ultimately rewarded by some of the most memorable-looking monsters in screen history; creatures that are fondly remembered by all baby boomers who watched the classic '60s TV show Supernatural Theatre, which showed the crawling eye expand each week during its opening credits. Though filmed on the cheap, these aliens look impressively yucky. The picture, on the whole, is uniformly well acted by all (Tucker, especially, underplays his role nicely), Stanley Black's subtle yet eerie score works wonders in ratcheting up the tension, and director Quentin Lawrence keeps things moving along briskly. I find this to be a quality example of horrific sci-fi, despite the lack of top-tier FX, and not at all campy (well, perhaps a bit cheesy!).

The effects on the creatures were also quite good, considering the time.The scientific explanations that are ALWAYS present in a movie like this were THIS time slightly better to swallow.Music was a bit over-dramatic, but that's part of the charm.A movie with a slow story, building towards an unavoidable climax.

The actors are all from the second division, which helps in a way because it makes the 'ordinary' characters they play seem more believable.There are some suitably gruesome killings which ratchet-up the tension as the 'mysterious cloud' begins to drift about. Whatever's in there must be pretty nasty. 'Mysterious Cloud'; has there ever been a horror/thriller that didn't have one? 'The Fog', 'Independence Day', 'War Of The Worlds', 'The Mist'; you just can't beat a mysterious cloud for - well, clouding things with mystery.When the monsters finally disclose themselves, you either laugh out loud or hide behind the sofa. Huge eyes with a bunch of whiplash tentacles no evident brain, no discernible digestive tract; these are just horror-props plain and simple. Interestingly, the beasties attack an avalanche-proof observatory and manage to shatter the thick, concrete walls.

Prof. Mitchell has his good friend American investigator of the supernatural Alan Brooks, Forrest Tucker, come over to Switzerland to help him out. Prof. Mitchell together with Brooks determined that some kind of alien creature is using the cloud, that defies science, as cover to kill mountain climbers and then decapitate them! It's never really explained in the film why these aliens are so hung up with the human skull or brain?The film Trollenberg Horror or The Crawling Eye goes on with both Prof. Mitchell and Alan Brooks getting the lowdown to what this, or these, creatures are really up to. This has to do with young Anne Pligrim, Janet Munro, who together with her older sister Sarah, Jnnifer Jayne, have a popular mind reading act. Anne in fact was guided to go with Sarah to Trollenberg by picking up wavelengths emitted from the creatures without them or her knowing about it.It's when mountain climber Brett, Andrew Faulds, came back from his climb that Anne realized that he was not really alive but fact a walking dead man. Bratt is being controlled by the aliens who had earlier killed and decapitated his fellow climber Dewhurst, Stuart Saunders, with Bratt ending up with Dewhurt's severed head in his nap-sack! Uncoordinated in his movements, due to being dead, a wild eyed and crazed looking Bratt attacks Anne only to get belted and knocked out cold by Brooks. Later while in custody after he murdered Trollenberg Mayor Klein, Fredrick Schiller, Bratt disintegrates into a blob of rotting and stinking flesh! That's when the aliens, who are controlling him, felt that Bratt's no longer any use to them.The Crawling Eye's final fifteen or so minutes has the aliens finally revile themselves as they come out of the cloud and attack the few people still remaining in Trollenberg.

This movie was actually genuinely frightening in certain parts. This movie can and might just give you chills. This film does not depend on the dark for its spooky value, as 90% of it takes place during the day, including the final showdown.

And is not THAT, precisely what effective ACTING is supposed to be all about?The supporting cast too, is thoroughly effective. Janet Munro, later to become a scream queen flick regular, of sorts, is perfectly cast as the young woman SEER, who has presaged the coming of some FORCE, far beyond the merely human or normal incarnation, who simply must stop at Trollenberg, and STAY at The Trollenberg, to see through this whole frightful episode, with Jennifer Jayne(* truly underrated actress, classically, BEAUTIFUL and Consummately British Actress, too, Jennifer Jayne hath always been, to me)as her loving and always heroically DUTIFUL Older Sister, by her side through it all.Alright, so the special effects are maudlin; alright, they're even lousy, by say post 1980 AD Horror/Sci-Fi Special Effects standards. But what about the ACTING, The WRITING QUALITY, the Script and storyline's real QUALITY, throughout this movie?THIS, is precisely why, I just can NOT, get fully into the Latest remakes, of such Movies as 1997's Titanic, or the latest King Kong movie, though BOTH movies obviously have, INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE, and intrinsically REALISTIC Special Effects.Still, without wishing to at ALL, besmirch the acting abilities of such as Leo Decaprio and Kate Winslet in 97's TITANIC movie, I still say, that by far the more COMPELLING acting performances for MY favorite Titanic movie, came from Sir Kenneth More, and the rest of the Cast from 1957's A Night To Remember. Surely, the special effects in the '57 enterprise and movie, WERE indeed HORRID, compared to the 1997 Blockbuster, but special effects, ... alone have NEVER been able to truly CARRY any movie, to me, even IF that movie is seemingly, almost fully dependent on Special Effects to carry its story along, such as in, e.g., 1977's Twin Cinematic Masterpieces, STAR WARS, and Close Encounters of The Third Kind.Close Encounters, to me, was carried along by the Brilliant starring role performance in it by Richard DREYFUSS, in his Roy Neary characterization. But the ACTING performances, did also carry those two flicks along, along with of course, the effective Story lines in each movie.Much the same, can defensively be said of The Trollenberg Terror, wherein the actors' performances are so compelling and yes, well-done, that the admittedly, Schlocko fifties special effects standards of The Trollenberg Terror, IE THE CRAWLING EYE, in my own, All-American, visage of the flick, are entirely forgivable.Does no one else consider Acting Skills, or Scriptwriting skills, or Directing skills, that fully convey TRUE and poignant human Emotion, fear, ecstasy, at having survived such as The Trollenberg Terror, to be perhaps, even FAR MORE Important to a given film's success, than even well-done special effects and such technical artistry? And yes, to conclude, I will say that the Special Effects skill levels of the other movies mentioned in my piece(and alright, NOT to include The Crawling Eye or A Night to Remember)are truly, highly accomplished works of High Art, by today's standards, or by the aesthetic standards of any epoch!

This film was shown under this title on TV in the U.S. in the early '60s and it held me spellbound in horror as a child.As an adult re-watching this movie, some of my first impressions were that it was remarkably slow and had poor special effects. However, I was also simultaneously impressed by nuances I had not noticed as a child, in particular the Swiss alpine ambiance and the underlying current of fear delivered via the dialog.There is an appreciable amount of ambiance in this old black-and-white film, which makes it generally pleasant to watch. There are snow-covered mountains, an alpine valley seen from a mountain top, the lowing of cows and the tinkling of cow bells, cable cars, an old wooden staircase with Swiss style decorations, drinks of brandy, a hip pocket metal flask, a wooden mountain hut, mountain climbers on ledges, an old train and train station, travel posters in the background announcing destinations like RIEDERALP and ZERMATT, and so on. It's unfortunate that the main mountain is shown only as a prop painting, but it all works. Put all these little details together and you get a convincing, foreign, Swiss alpine atmosphere that reminds me of the Matterhorn ride at Disneyland and its atmospheric queue area.In the various dialogs, the locals are obviously eager to cover up the recent gruesome climbing accidents and the rumors from the local villagers. The car driver Mr. Klein stammers and hedges when asked directly about a climbing accident, Hans similarly excuses himself when pressed for details, and Alan the professor keeps downplaying an obviously freakish cloud that hangs over the Trollenberg mountain. All this creates an atmosphere of dread and denial, especially when the dialogs are delivered in German accents with sinister voices, as if the locals have inside knowledge that they don't wish to share with tourists.As with so many other films of the 1950s, this one has an excessive and unrealistic emphasis on ESP and mind control. Maybe those themes were popular in the 1950s because they didn't require expensive special effects. In this film the telepathic woman Anne Pilgrim is frequently talking in a spaced-out voice as if in a trance, and constantly fainting afterward. She in turn is the target of two dead men whose bodies are reanimated by the crawling eye, who attempt to murder her so that she can't telepathically monitor the alien monster.Overall, the film seems carefully thought-out in many ways, yet quite negligent in others. Therefore if you can overlook its weak points and savor its strong points, it's still an enjoyable film.

Although it was a British import, it had many elements of American sci-fi (namely, a passable plot and low-budget special effects). The difference is that the acting is more credible, Forrest Tucker notwithstanding.The plot revolves around mysterious deaths in the Alps, near an Austrian town called Trollenberg. It seems several mountain climbers have met grisly deaths, including one at the very beginning who gets his head ripped off. They don't show it, but seeing the body from the neck down, covered in blood is effective enough. Also, for some reason, a telepath named Anne Pilgrim (played by Janet Munro, who went on to do such movies as Darby O'Gill & The Little People and Swiss Family Robinson before dying of acute myocarditis at age 38) feels the need to stop at Trollenberg instead of continuing on to Vienna. She and her sister Sarah (Jennifer Jayne) are part of a mind-reading act. While on their train, they incur the interest of Alan Brooks (Forrest Tucker playing another fish-out-of-water role as a serious leading man), a man with hazy United Nations connections, who is heading to Trollenberg for mysterious reasons.It seems aliens are trying to acclimate themselves to Earth's atmosphere so they can take up shop. They use a radioactive cloud to hide their activities and kill mountain climbers who get too close. They also take some of the climbers and make them into zombies so they can kill potential enemies. In this case, it's Anne Pilgrim who, as a telepath, can sense the aliens' presence.The action takes place at a brisk pace, simply because the aliens need to get acclimated before their activities invoke a response from mankind. We also learn that Tucker and Professor Crevett (Warren Mitchell), head of the Trollenberg Observatory that first noticed the cloud, were involved in a similar situation in the Andes Mountains in South America. They were too late to stop that situation as the aliens bailed when it got too hot. Now, however, they may get the chance to put an end to them for good.The acting is crisp, save for Tucker. Veteran British stage actor Lawrence Payne does a nice turn as Phillip Truscott, a newspaper reporter and love interest for Anne. If you can ignore the fact that he was assigned to investigate the Andes incident and just happens to be in town for this invasion, that is. Particular menacing is Andrew Faulds as Dewhurst, a local climber who becomes a zombie. With an eerie sneer, he decapitates a climbing companion, kills two would-be rescuers with a climbing pole to their heads, then attacks Anne Pilgrim twice, getting bashed in the head, then shot for his trouble.The film has a few glaring flaws. The special effects are low-budget. Close-up scenes of the aliens (as giant eyeballs, hence the title) are creepy, but when they move up the mountain, they're laughable. When Tucker and Payne hit them with Molotov cocktails, they burn up like matches (a common complaint I have about British sci-fi is the way they don't even attempt to make explosions or fire look like anything other than match heads flaring). Another flaw is when Brett, Dewhurst's climbing partner, is killed, rescuers find his cabin door barred from the inside and the windows locked and intact. Yet, his head is missing. A neat trick. Also, when UN bombers torch the mountain to get at the crawling eyes, the whole attack looks totally cheesy.A few notes in parting. Janet Munro is not related to Caroline Munro (Golden Voyage of Sinbad, The Spy Who Loved Me), despite rumors to the contrary. Also, the original title of the movie is The Trollenberg Terror. The Crawling Eye was the American title. For some reason, American audiences were believed incapable of understanding the cerebral titles of British films and needed titles that were sensational. Thus, The Quatermass Experiment became The Creeping Unknown; Quatermass 2 became Enemy From Space; Quatermass and the Pit was changed to Five Million Years to Earth, and Trollenberg Terror became The Crawling Eye. Finally, this film was first shown on a twin bill with The Strange Case of Planet X (changed, of course, for American audiences to Cosmic Monsters). It also starred Forrest Tucker, who is even more wooden than in Crawling Eye. If you want to see some good acting from Tucker, stick to The Abominable Snowman of the Himalayas where he plays a selfish, conceited and boorish American businessman clashing with Peter Cushing while in pursuit of the fabled monster.

One of the girls is empathic and keeps getting herself in danger. Of course, we eventually see the crawling eye. It looks like a big pastry with one eye and skinny tentacles. There is also something about the temperature on the mountain. Anyway, it eventually gets down to fighting with fire. It's not that I don't appreciate these kinds of films, but lets not get carried away with praising them, other than their sentimental attraction to drive-in movie goers of the fifties.

Writer Jimmy Sangster (adapting the work of Peter Key) had only been working a few years, but was a rising star with such Hammer classics as Dracula and Curse of Frankenstein under his belt. Here he crafts a tale of science gone wrong mixed with the living dead, and done to perfection.Most interestingly, shortly before the film was released, Lawrence directed a 6-part television miniseries with Key writing the episodes. Today, no copies are thought to exist, and there is no way to know what changes were made for the big screen, as well as what cuts had to be administered to accommodate the shorter running time.Leading the cast is Forrest Tucker as United Nations troubleshooter Alan Brooks. Tucker had been in nearly 100 films during the 1940s and 50s, and easily handles his role here as the hero -- part action star, part scientific genius. He is assisted by Warren Mitchell as a caricatured Swiss professor (a portrayal which provides the film's only comic relief).The standout performance comes from Janet Munro as a semi-psychic young woman who goes into trances when she nears the cloud. One gets the impression that she had a bright career before her, and indeed was given a Golden Globe in 1960. Sadly, she passed unexpectedly at age 38.Today's audiences might find some of the special effects cheesy. Obviously the crew used miniature sets and plenty of rear projection. But in general, there is no denying the impressive use of fog, the freezing effects and the creepy realism of the titular eye. While other 1950s films were busy using radiation as a plot device for large bugs, this one went in a completely different direction -- possibly the only film of its kind.Notably, Crawling Eye was the final film to be produced by Southall Studios, one of the earliest pioneer film studios in the UK, which had made a steady stream of films since 1924. They went out on a high note, which is always nice.

It picks up again at the end, but it just moved to slowly and refused to reveal the monsters for to long to be a good movie. The story has these two sisters on a train making their way to Geneva, however, one of the sisters apparently has a vision or something and they end up stopping in this one resort mountain town where some strange things have been happening. Seems a lot of climbers are disappearing and there is even an incident where one climber lost his head in an unexplainable way. Well a guy visiting the area seems to suspect something and his friend at the observatory also believes something is happening that is more sinister than just a bunch of freak accidents. However, during the middle portion of the film there is just a bit to much speculation and way to much build up before they finally let us see the monsters in all their glory. They do not look that bad for the time, as I have seen a lot worse monsters in films made much later than this one. The film is also rather more bloody with a couple of people who have lost their heads along the way. The film was just very close to being a good movie, perhaps a better cast could have helped this one as I had a hard time understanding the ones they had at times during the film. Also, they could have been a lot less skittish about their monsters and give us an earlier peek. So while overall I did not like it, it was not boring and borderline good.

A nearby research observatory run by cosmic ray scientist Professor Crevett (Warren Mitchell) has detected a strange cloud that seems to be hovering at the peak of the mountain, Crevett sends for UN scientist Alan Brooks (Forrest Tucker) who arrives is shown the cloud & informed that is is radioactive. The cloud starts move down the mountain as more people turn up dead, finally the scientists realise that they are dealing with hostile aliens that want to take over the world.This British made sci-fi horror film was released in the US under the more sensationalistic title of The Crawling Eye & was cut down from 84 minutes to 75 minutes by the distributors who wanted to get to the alien monsters quicker, the version I will be basing my comment on is the full 84 minute cut under the title The Trollenberg Terror. Directed by Quentin Lawrence from a script by Hammer horror regular Jimmy Sangster this is a fairly decent little sci-fi horror film, the setting helps with it's small isolated village & hazardous mountain terrain & the actual alien monsters are kept off screen until the last fifteen minutes which helps build suspense because when they do make an appearance the special effects are not very special at all. There's a fair amount of theorising going on & huge leaps of logic are made by the character's, it's never really really revealed why the aliens are here anyway apart from a guess by Crevett. There's no explanation as how the aliens decapitated that guy in the log cabin since all the doors were locked from the inside, why did they decapitate people anyway? It moves along at a decent enough pace & has a nice mix of horror & sci-fi but I wouldn't call it a classic. A perfectly fine way to pass 80 odd minutes but not much else, it's fairly predictable & just about meets the genres standards but rarely rises above them if truth be told.Once the alien monsters are seen at the end they look alright when required to do nothing but sit there, when they need to move & act menacing the effects fall apart. The monsters look like giant pulsing brains with an eye & tentacles that are alright conceptually but when brought to life on screen with unconvincing model shots, silly sound effects & tentacles that look more like rope the effective creepiness that the film had built up with it's mystery is lost. The main hero doesn't even really get to fight them as he just ask's for a load of bombs to be dropped, The Trollenberg Terror never quite comes to life. The film was based on an original six part television series made by the BBC called The Trollenberg Terror (1956) which no longer exists, the makers obviously saw the success the Quatermass film had after that too had been adapted from a BBC serial & wanted to cash-in with more of the same. Unusually for a film of this period there's a headless body shown & a decapitated head in a sack.Shot on what was probably a low budget this was filmed in Middlesex here in England. Production values are alright, some of the sets look a little fake & the special effects don't hold up too well but it's a product of it's time & could have been worse. The acting is OK, it's not great but again it could have been worse.The Trollenberg Terror, of the The Crawling Eye if you prefer is a good 50's sci-fi horror film that is of it's time & suffers from the limitations of it. A decent enough way to pass 80 minutes if nothing else.

I am not saying Chris Carter was familiar with Eye, but the similarities are there. An investigator into the paranormal for the U.N. gets a cal from an old buddy to check out a disturbing situation atop Trollenberg Mountain. These two investigated a similar case in Peru or somewhere like that several years earlier. Turns out the disturbance is aliens from outer space, as it was in the Peru case. The aliens move about in a radioactive cloud and kill people in gruesome fashion. Some of those they kill become their undead slaves. The same day the U.N. investigator arrives, a pair of sisters show up who perform a mentalist act. The catch is, one of the sisters is indeed telepathic, and is receiving messages from the aliens. We mercifully don't get a good look at the aliens until halfway through, as they are ludicrous looking puppets that wouldn't scare a 4 year old. But before they are revealed, the suspense is built nicely and the film is quite unsettling. Forrest Tucker plays the investigator and the very pretty Janet Munro of Darby O'Gill fame is the telepath. As low budget and backlot stagey as Eye is, it is worth a look. Avoid the MST3K version, unless all you are after is a laugh.

It's actually a much better film than I remember. I have to assume that the Americanized version I watched as a kid was heavily edited so the context was lost.It was usually titled The Crawling Eye in the US, and the fact that it had Forrest Tucker (later better known for Comedy) makes you forget that this was in fact a British film.The plot is that a mysterious cloud appears in the Swiss Alps, accompanied by a number of unexplained deaths. A team of heroes which includes a mind reader and her sister, a scientist, a reporter and a UN investigator, fight a bunch of monsters who live in super-cold clouds.The climax is when they are trapped in the observatory, battling the beasts who are finally revealed to be one-eyed giant octopi. In many ways, the ending is anti-climatic because they did a very good job of building suspense without showing you the monster, but when the monster is revealed, well, it just kind of looked silly and could be easily defeated with Molotov Cocktails.This movie also has the distinction of being the first film mocked by Mystery Science Theatre 3000, which is kind of sad, because it isn't that bad of a film.

Baker and Monty Berman. While here he was dealing in science-fiction, he would also pen their JACK THE RIPPER (1959) and THE SIEGE OF SIDNEY STREET (1960), both of which attempted to recreate notorious real-life incidents and whose own viewing will follow presently.Like Hammer's own QUATERMASS titles (scripted by Nigel Kneale), which were the prototype of this subgenre, the film under review saw its origins as a TV serial actually, Sangster had earlier been responsible for X&#x96;THE UNKNOWN (1956), the very first off-shoot of that classic franchise (again made by the famed British House Of Horror). Still, even if the writing is reasonably intelligent (feeding on the alien invasion/mind control themes then prevalent within the genre), the 'lower-berth' nature of the production does render the proceedings slightly less than persuasive for one thing, the design of the creature (The Crawling Eye, as the U.S. moniker would have it, though there is actually more than one and it can perhaps best be described as an over-sized octopus!) is more silly than scary, their telepathic connection to Janet Munro's character never properly explained&#x85;nor, for that matter, just what kind of threat she was supposed to pose for them that they had to send 'zombies' &#x96; whose flesh literally disintegrates when exposed to extreme heat &#x96; in order to eliminate her, since she is mostly so distraught by these visions that she faints outright after each experience! Another illogical detail pertains to the walls of the fortress-like conservatory (to which the severely under-populated village retreats during the alien clampdown), which are shown as not able to withstand the sheer impact of the invaders' weight, yet we are asked to believe that the bombs fired away by the stock-footage planes that come to the rescue will not harm the edifice! This is not forgetting the monsters' victims, which are bafflingly left beheaded (though this may have been merely a way of incorporating gory effects, which were becoming fashionable around this time!).I cannot say whether it was done on purpose, but it seems to me that the Central European setting in this case was a direct nod to the Universal FRANKENSTEIN films (which had just been revived by none other than Hammer with the involvement of Sangster himself!), down to the iconic moment in which an innocent young girl comes face to face with the monster &#x96; though here she is saved by hero Forrest Tucker. Typically, an American lead (albeit hardly a star) was recruited to secure overseas commercial appeal actually, he had already appeared in Hammer's fine THE ABOMINABLE SNOWMAN (1957; scripted by Kneale and co-starring company and genre icon Peter Cushing) and would also make the even less distinguished THE STRANGE WORLD OF PLANET X (1958; which I have yet to watch, even if I do have a TV-sourced copy of it somewhere!).Mind you, while I seem to have been rather harsh on the film, I enjoyed it a good deal if anything, apart from the familiar suspense situations and exciting action sequences, it is well-enough cast &#x96; numbering among its other protagonists future Hammer alumni Jennifer Jayne (from KISS OF THE VAMPIRE 1963 and THE REPTILE 1966) as Munro's elder sister and the other half of their clairvoyant stage-act, Laurence Payne (who had been the protagonist of the interesting Poe adaptation THE TELL-TALE HEART 1960) as an initially suspicious figure who, revealed to be a scoop-seeking reporter, eventually turns heroic and Warren Mitchell as the obligatory eccentric scientist (who has summoned former colleague Tucker to Trollenberg after a similar 'radioactive cloud' occurrence &#x96; which the aliens utilize to travel in! &#x96; at another mountain-top setting, the Andes, some years before).

It takes a little while before the crawling eyes are properly shown on screen, but they instantly reminded me of the Brainbug in Starship Troopers. I wonder if Paul Verhoeven & C° found some inspiration in this underrated and almost forgotten gem of British horror. Trollenberg is the name of a picturesque little village in Switserland, famous and popular particularly among Alpinists. A befriended colleague has called the eminent scientist Alan Brooks here because, lately, several climbers died under mysterious circumstances whilst climbing the Trollenberg. They were gruesomely decapitated after the passing of an odd and seemingly unnatural cloud of mist. Meanwhile, traveling sisters Anne and Sarah Pelgrim interrupt their voyage to Geneva because some higher force calls to them. Jimmy Sangster penned down the script for this film, and if you're slightly familiar with the work he did for the legendary Hammer Studios, you know he was one of the most gifted and professional writers of his time. He puts the main emphasis on tension and pays almost no attention to the potentially corny relationships between characters. Admittedly some sequences, entire chapters even, are quite dull and redundant and the climax is disappointing as well. Nevertheless, an underrated and recommended film.

In it we have Forrest Tucker, long past his prime and career swirling down towards the inevitable Columbo episodes, as our hero, out to foil the nefarious plans of mist-dwelling aliens who take the form of huge, gelatinous eyes.  Unfortunately for us, they only make their appearance in the final third of the film, but when they do the predictably cheesy SFX provides an ample cue for invective throwing on the part of us poor viewers.

To try and describe the odd creatures is very hard--you really have to see it. It looks a bit like an octopus, a giant eyeball and a lot of pus all rolled into one.This is a decent 1950s horror/sci-fi film, though the monsters themselves are certainly NOT the highlight of the film. Another less than stellar aspect of the film is how incredibly easy these things turned out to be! What is decent is the rest of the story as well as the acting--led by veteran American actor, Forrest Tucker, in this British production. While far from great, the film is less silly than most (at least until you see the aliens) and the story (at least up until then) seems thoughtful and interesting.By the way, if you do watch the film, you'll see that in a rare case of actually accomplishing something, the UN comes to the rescue.
