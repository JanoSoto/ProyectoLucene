This low-key, purposefully bland drama, with spare touches of humor from Margaret (Parker Posey), is steeped in realism, making it all the sadder. Margaret, Paula, and Jane befriend Iris, the central character, at her new temp job.  Margaret is loud-mouthed, foul-mouthed, and smart.  Paula (Lisa Kudrow) is a young woman with fast-fading beauty, loose morals, and no hope for a future.  Jane (Alanna Ubach) is biding her time waiting for her man to marry her and take her away from the temp world.  And Iris (Toni Collette) is intelligent but timid.  Unlike her new friends, she has the opportunity to score a real job at an interview that her father has lined up for her; however, low self-esteem, shyness, and a new-found friendship with the office girls contribute to her procrastination.  Outward, upward mobility seems to scare her. One day Iris stares blankly at her empty diary.  Her temp job affects her so badly that she can find nothing to write about; she's been turned into a mindless zombie.  During a moment of introspection, she thinks, `Sometimes it hits you, how quickly the present fades into the past.  And you question everything around you.  You wonder if anything you'd ever do would matter, or if you could just disappear without a trace.'  Jill and Karen Sprecher's script is punctuated with perceptive, thought provoking lines, many of which comment on the individual's insignificance in society.  Early in the film, Margaret comments on how `a person can just drift through life like they're not connected to anyone or anything.'  Later, Iris admits that  `even if a person wanted to break free, they could find out they've got nowhere else to go.' Ultimately, the Sprechers' four-character quasi-study can be applied to everyone, every day.  Some characters move on, thus positively changing their lives forever; others, whether out of preference, procrastination, or lack of education, stay put, forever locked in dead-end jobs.  At the film's end, Iris realizes that improving her situation can come only from `never hiding, never sitting silently, and never just waiting -- and waiting -- and watching the world go by.'  Clockwatchers may be a `small' film with a soft voice, but at least it has something to say.

When you're in the midst of an era, it's hard to see what characterizes it. I think Clockwatchers does a terrific job of capturing a facet of the temp world of the 80's/90's. I was a temp for a year in 1988. It's quite accurate.But you don't have to be a temp to recognize these characters. Yes Dilbert, yes Office Space, and especially the beginning of Joe vs the Volcano have these same foils. But I think Clockwatchers' take was unique. The characters were well developed while still being archetypes. There was a subtlety and style that all the others listed chose against.The direction and cinematography of this film is terrific. It takes guts to burn film doing a close-up of someone's glasses for 10 seconds. There is real art to this film. The writing, the directing, the pacing, editing, all right up at the top of the scale. The acting was fine, but I don't think it's the strong suit of this movie. Toni Collette is a standout. While I love Parker Posey, I think she was probably a bit over the top here. The Muzak, while as mood-setting as the buzz of florescent lighting, can grate at a viewer.This film touched on too may things to list them all. Here's a sample... What are you doing with your life if you're waiting for it to burn off? Isn't it exhausting and poisoning to pretend to look busy all day? If you are a cog in a machine, and accomplishing nothing at that too, did you really even exist? Are the troublemakers in life getting us in trouble, or offering us freedom (note there are two people here stirring up the pot)? What is theft (and theft of services)? Where is the dividing line between unethical play and immorality? At what point do you give up on the dream of personal growth? Are some people better than others? What does beauty (and grooming) have to do with it? Does the corporate hierarchy define our worth to others or our self-worth? What is loyalty and betrayal, to whom do you owe how much, and how do you give consent to those obligations/ownership? Work/friends/family are all portrayed as villains and allies wielding this loyalty Sword of Damocles.One IMDB reviewer said this film was a good way to kill time after work.

These action flicks are ten-times as dull as the corporate setting for this astonishing study on class, friendship, and inner-awareness. Or maybe it is the female perspective or chick-flick factor that turn certain people off. Or maybe temporary status in modern American business isn't relevant to everyone.  Or the subtle, less gimmicky observations of reality.     Clockwatchers is all of these things at once. Toni Collette plays the ultra-shy newcomer to Global Credit, the ultimate transnational corporation, who slowly comes to realize that the doomed bond she makes with three other temps is an extremely sacred event in her life. Iris slowly gains confidence through such comradery and at one point she doesn't want to leave, even though her father has higher career expectations for his daughter. Iris comes full circle at the end of the film, confronts one of her many bosses whom plot against her, and atones for not standing with Parker Posey, who is the life of the party as Margaret.     The creators of this film are SO incredibly accurate in revealing what worklife is actually like (the boredom, sharing someone else's space, not knowing someone's name or them not knowing yours), that I felt almost honored to know I wasn't alone. (Movies that are this honest about despair are never depressing.) This is combined by the subtle observations of Iris, which I suppose aren't as exciting as blowing someone's head off or toilet humor, but intriguing nonetheless. It is finally layered with political analysis as the female temps organize a strike.                 Suffice it to say, Clockwatchers covers a lot of ground, but the layers are folded well together in a way that makes you care about what happens to these characters and their station in life. A must-see sleeper for those who prefer (for example) Merchant & Ivory over Van Damme & Seagal. 9 out of 10.

We saw this witty comedy in its original debut and it was a pleasure to watch it again on IFC. Ms. Sprecher and her sister Karen wrote a delicious movie that is on the one level a satire about the way temps are used in an office, and it's at the same time, a character study about these four souls at the center of the movie.Each one of the young women in the film has a problem. They come together because they don't have a life on their own. Iris, Margaret, Paula and Jane, form a bond because they find safety in numbers. Iris is a clever girl whose shyness doesn't let her assert herself and is dragged along by the others that show stronger personalities. Margaret puts up a front, but deep down, she is just as vulnerable as the others. The most pathetic one is Paula, a woman who is pretending to be what she is not. Jane is waiting for the security of marriage to beat it out of being a temp.When the sneaky Cleo is hired as a permanent employee, the problems in the office are magnified. As things begin disappearing from the office, all eyes point to the four temps. That is the beginning of the end of the clique, as they knew it. Iris is the one that stays the longer and she is the one that discovers the mystery of the missing things in the office, but alas, it's too late, because at that time she leaves the temp job.Toni Collette, Parker Posey, Lisa Kudrow and Alana Ubach, are perfect as the four temps. Toni Collette has a better role where to shine as most of the story is seen through her eyes. Parker Posey is delightful as the free spirited Margaret. Lisa Kudrow also makes a good contribution with her pathetic Paula. Helen Firzgerald, who only has a few lines, cast a giant shadow as the creepy new employee that wants to make friends with Iris, only to be ignored.The Sprecher sisters created a film that feels real a situation one has seen is prevalent in the office setting.

(**TWO SPOILERS AHEAD**)","Date":"26 May 2002","Score":"10 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  This is one of those movies whose brilliance sneaks up on you. I saw this movie when it first opened in theaters 4 years ago and I distinctly remember not being able to take my eyes off of it...in spite of the fact that its pace is languid and at times meandering, and its main conflict starts rather late in the movie. Nevertheless, those elements didn't bother me, because the film's primary purpose is not so much to be a conventional film as it wants to be a mirror reflecting the hell that is corporate life. And it accomplishes that goal flawlessly.As a slice-of-corporate-life, this movie is so accurate that it sometimes seems like a docudrama. Being an office worker myself, I was impressed by how many details it captured from the cold, impersonal cubicles to the monotonous overhead music to the arrogance and possessiveness of the person in charge of the office supplies (he'd have you believe he's in charge of planets instead of paper clips) to the secretive, whispered suspicion of and curiosity about new hires, and even to the way bored workers use the up-and-down feature on their swivel chairs to help chase away boredom.Some people view this movie as much ado about nothing since it deals with office life, which, on the surface, seems least likely to offer anything in the way of drama or entertainment. But the movie uses office life as a metaphor for the world we live in and how some of us feel overlooked, unappreciated, or just plain invisible. And the only way to succeed in the corporate world, as in life, is to take action, to make a move, to stop the stagnance. And that's why Toni Collette's character ultimately emerges as a hero. The way she finally takes action by helping the recently (and wrongly) fired Margaret get a recommendation is both touching and inspiring.The cast is great--each player has mastered the mannerisms, the attitudes, and even the blank stares that result from working in an office 5 days a week, 52 weeks a year. But the standout is Parker Posey as the opinionated, defiant, in-your-face Margaret. I've always had reservations about Posey who--in other movies--has struck me as a little too self-consciously cutesy, but here she delivers, and there's almost never a false note as she creates a character who is simultaneously ambitious, hopeful, cynical, upbeat, and sad.Having seen this movie about 4 times thus far, I tend to regard it as a special little friend whom my other friends don't quite understand.

This film is linear - one scene following the other chronologically - and therefore not as challenging to the viewer as 13 Conversations, but it does leave its mark (as one character in the movie has been told to do).  Writer/Director Jill Sprecher is extremely adept in nailing down specifics, and this gift for detail is in full evidence here. The film is about fear, lunch hours, pettiness, toilet paper, loneliness, rubber band balls, despair, paper clips, friendship, pencils, desperation, cocktail garnishes, anger - downright fury, actually -  at being marginalized by the illusion of society - and much more.  Toni Collette's face is still in my memory  - her terrified-to-do-or-say-the-wrong-thing rabbit eyes, her rapture at feeling connected to her 3 fellow temp workers (and specifically, seeing her nose crinkle the way it does when she smiles), the desolation of seeing their bond destroyed by wretched but inevitable bone-chilling office politics and fear. It's a small slice of life, Clockwatchers, but it's an important slice, one that anyone who has ever interacted with anyone on a daily, money-driven basis can relate to. If you've ever held a job, I'm saying, you will see yourself mirrored in at least some of these meticulous details.

The office politics, the way the permanent workers look down on the temps, the menial and mind-numbing tasks, the good old boys (mostly white males, at that time) who were in charge and above it all. Not all of my jobs were as horrible as the office depicted in this movie, but enough were that it occasionally gave me chills. I hope that things have improved, with the proliferation of computers and other advanced technology, at least in terms of the work itself. But I can guarantee that in some places, that temp vs. perm caste system will always be there, regardless of how the jobs get done.The performances in the movie were excellent. I really liked Parker Posey's exuberant portrayal, as well as Toni Collette's studied, more subtle effort. She expresses so much pain and frustration through her facial expressions and quiet, even-toned narration.The movie is not for everyone, and some viewers will no doubt be bored and/or confused by it.

It shows how many men view their work absurd, tedious, and unfulfilling.Clockwatchers does the same thing, but in a fundamentally different way. It is slower, more introspective, and conniving. It represents how many women view themselves at work ignored, mistreated, and accused.I find both these movies extremely satisfying and insightful, but for different reasons. Office space is a masterpiece of quirky humor, unidimensional characters, and a lose, very funny plot. It expresses what a lot of people feel about work - that its a big joke. Clockwatchers shows the slow and destructive boredom that that burn through friendships and humiliate people. The characters are considerably more dimensional and real. Iris makes a very odd hero for a movie. She is extremely quiet, dismissive, and shy. Her complex relationships with her three work pals show that she can rise out of her shell to take action as well as sink deep into mistrust and anger. If you are looking for a wham-bam laugh out loud work movie, go see Office Space. If you want something slower and more character oriented, see Clockwatchers.

It is a look at the every thing that divides people, no matter how silly the things may seem.  One may look at everything people do in this movie, and think Why are these people getting so upset.  Nothing here REALLY matters, but they pretend like it's the end of the world.  Well, this is the only world they know.  This is the world they are stuck in, and this is the only world they think they'll ever be a part of.  The little things show just as much about character as the killings in a war.  Some of the characters kind of realize there's more to life, and these are the ones we hope for.  There is so much in this film that could be observed.  Saying this is a movie about a bunch of office temps is like saying American Beauty is a movie about a man going through mid-life crisis.  There is so much more in it.  It is possible to learn as much about human nature in this as it there is in an epic war movie.The cast is particularly superb.  Parker Posey was born to play her role.  There is no actress that can play the arrogant, hyper, rude yet somehow lovable female as Posey.  Lisa Kudrow adds a thorough discomfort the movie is trying to achieve.  In Clockwatchers, she plays her stereotypical comic bimbo role in a way that doesn't seem funny.  Her character is more sad.  In a typical office comedy, her character would get the most laughs.  Not here.  She plays it in a way you can only feel sorry for her, and you can only hope she finds a better life.  Somehow, you know that she can't.This is certainly not a comfortable movie to sit through.  You have to be more in the mood to see Saving Private Ryan than you would, say, Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion.  It digs too deep, and most people wouldn't be in the mood to see that on a Friday night.  If you look deep enough, however, and are patient enough, there are so many great gifts this movie can provide.  My rating 10/10.

Along with Paula (Lisa Kudrow) and Jane (Alanna Ubach) they form an us-against-them support group and Iris begins to come out of her shell as a person as well. Soon Margaret is conducting a guerilla war against a permanent hire (Helen FitzGerald) who gets a job Margaret had been aiming for and who is almost a mirror image of Iris when she came to work a few weeks before. The office drama is played out in great detail, and the solidarity of the temps is one of the war's casualties.This is a fine, above-average first effort from director Jill Sprecher, who wrote the screenplay with her sister Karen. She's obviously keen to show her skills here, and sometimes she directs the movie like it was 'Citizen Kane,' but that's not much of a fault. A little more serious problem is that after its climax the film loses some steam moving towards the denouement, but overall the screenwriting sisters have produced an entertaining film that speaks with authority on its subject.

She goes from a bouncy free-spirit to an aggressive troublemaker to an outcast without warning, and her transformation is fascinating to watch. Lisa Kudrow, too, gives another great performance (and this was before her scene-stealing role in The Opposite of Sex) as the possibly compulsive liar Paula. The fourth actress, Alannah Ubach, I have not seen in anything else, but she is absolutely a delight to watch. Smaller roles by actors such as Jamie Kennedy, Bob Balaban (Posey's costar in Waiting For Guffman), and David James Elliot are also performed with perfection. If you appreciate a movie about interesting characters in everyday situations, then this is a movie for you. Many people have complained about the slow pace, but I have never found this to be boring. The slow pace is effective in making viewers feel as desperate and unimportant as the temps. 9/10 "},{"Title":"Quietly funny and strangely haunting","Date":"29 December 2005","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" For some reason I'd been resisting seeing this film until a friend thrust it into my hands and said, C'mon, Toni Collette and Parker Posey, how can you go wrong?Maybe I was resisting because I didn't want to see my life up there on the screen. Currently working in a temp job (where I am typing this review), Clockwatchers is terrifyingly familiar. It's not a hilarious comedy, although it is quite funny. Certain moments threaten to veer into David Lynch-style self-conscious surrealism, but the director reigns these moments in, in the nick of time.It's a film about small things happening in an enclosed space, and the friendships that grow between the most unlikely of people, due mostly to proximity. The mood of paranoia that emerges in the second half of the film is perfect - turning trivialities into monumental acts of anarchy and betrayal. The office becomes a sealed microcosm where the theft of a tiny plastic monkey becomes the end of the world.Not everyone is going to understand this film - it's not Office Space, which is more accessibly 'wacky'. You're not going to chuck it on with your mates and have a good laugh. It's much more sombre and serious and ultimately quite sad. And it's made me quit my job (so perhaps I should have given it 10 stars, just for that).

The main characters are four women who entered the working world with hopes of making a life for themselves that would set them apart from the rest of the rat race, but had their dreams dashed when they realized that in today's crowded job market they had to take what they could get. They ended up with desk space in a sterile, faceless office where they depend on their sense of humor and respect for one another to get through the day.This is a story that depends strongly on dialogue and character development to keep the viewer interested. It largely works, with a lot of amusing moments and sharp dialogue throughout, as well as keen observations about the humdrum existence too many of us lead. The always likeable Parker Posey has a terrific performance as the most rebellious and plainspoken of the group. There's also Bob Balaban playing his usual fussy nebbish character, this time as a meticulous number cruncher who can't let go of his pencils. In its second half, however, the story surrenders to the pessimism it tries to battle; the tone shifts from `Dilbert' to Kafka, and some of the characters suddenly become cold and unsympathetic. Nevertheless, it remains insightful and entertaining, something to which the average working stiff could relate.

I loved the movie because it was so true to life.  I hated the movie because it was so true to life - or perhaps because it reminded me how life really is a lot of the time.  The drudgery of being a cog in the corporate machine is evident in all four of the women, and the eventual contract termination of Margaret because of her attempts to stand out in the machine, are too often the fact of everyday life. Iris's struggle to make her mark, as she puts it, is almost eerily true to life; the world often resists our best attempts to leave our I was here! sign on it.  How many times in my somewhat gray existence have I thought, as Iris, If I were to disappear, would anyone notice? But the important, uplifting fact of the movie (and perhaps the only one that kept me from going suicidal despite terrific plot) is Iris's final scratching-out act to show that she will keep struggling to make her mark.This, I think, is a bit of a diamond in the rough.  I'd almost consider it an indie film, except I believe it got more press than most indies.  On a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being best), I'd give this movie an 8.5.

I guess everyone wants to fit in-whether it be your job or school.  If you can find some little niche that you do belong in enjoy it because sometimes that fit never lasts.  I think that's what happened in this movie.  The 4 main characters fit in with each other because they were temps and had that little thing in common.  But what else they had in common is not clear and I think it wasn't enough to hold the little group together.  Sure, we can blame it on the thief plot but in the long run relationships like that don't last because they have very little in common.  As for the new girl Cleo I actually felt sorry for her-she was such a lonely soul and it seemed she tried to make friends with those 4 but they didn't want to include her in. She paid Iris a compliment and also said hi but all she did was stare back at her-funny coming from those who complain about being ignored by the permanent workers because they were temps. She stole the things from everyone because it gave her a part of them since she didn't make friends with anyone.I can really feel for the Cleo character.

I never knew that an office could feel so oppressive, and this film portrays it was successful accuracy. Another thing that surprised me was the unexpected seriousness, I actually found myself thinking about some of the character's observations on careers and goals, how sometimes we can totally lose our identity when all we try to do is to please others and maintain a decent salary. When Clockwatchers was over, I actually found myself depressed, and menaced by the possibility that my life could turn out like the characters'.

The other actresses are also good, and most of the scenes they share together are enjoyable to watch. The only thing that could of used some fixing was the film's last half hour, it dragged on with the whole new girl plotline and the final conclusion was too vague to satisfy.

The relationship between the four temps never seemed like the Ya-Ya Sisterhood or anything like that, but it was still a shock to see how rapidly things deteriorated between them. And the brilliance of the kaleidoscope-like script by the Sprecher sisters is evident in how the responsibility for the loss of friendships changes with different viewings. Is it the fault of Margaret, who is too smart to play dumb but might be much more happy if she could learn to try? Of Iris, who at a crucial moment makes a judgment about Margaret, and then doesn't correct it? Or Paula, who is the first person to turn on Margaret and only seems interested in her own life? Or Jane, who is a shell of a person? Maybe it's Cleo the full-time worker, or Barbara the officer Rule Bitch, or---the situation that the company puts them all in, hoping to assign blame, not unlike what I was considering.I related more strongly to this movie having been an office temp worker than I suspect I would have if I'd never taken on such work. The company I worked at was actually a great place, and my boss was a terrific guy who knew mine (and everyone else's) names. Yet the work was mostly repetitive typing and filing, there were times when I simply had nothing to do and ended up scrambling to fill the time, and the thought of doing a job like that for longer than the period I did it (eight weeks) would have been like a prison sentence embedded in free society. I decided to leave because I needed to find a full-time job, and was lucky to do so about a month after my last temp day. CLOCKWATCHERS gets the tone of temp life down pitch-perfectly; no matter how good being a temp can be, it's a lower caste in the office system, period.And the last few scenes, where Iris pulls off a downright brilliant plan to help her friend at last, is a perfect capper here. 9/10.

It has a low key humor about it, but it is really quite dark. Iris stumbles into a group friendship at work that finally makes her feel less awkward and belonging to something that matters. All four of the ladies have their issues, mostly in some form of denial of reality. To me, the healthiest one of the bunch is Parker Posey's character, Margaret. Posey does one of her best roles ever playing a spunky, irascible but ultimately hollow young woman who is floating through life, much to the disappointment of her parents. Margaret gets it, though. She knows the score, with the BS the company puts out and even the things her friends try to hide. She has a fearlessness about her. As all good things must end, the closeness and bonding come to an end when a strange, shy almost Iris-like character from another dimension comes into the firm, Cleo. Cleo is a disturbed woman who makes up for her shortcomings but shortchanging others, in this case by targeted stealing that makes it seem as if the four temps-Cleo is permanent-are the ones stealing. It works, the four are suspected and gradually put into more and more demeaning work situations. At one point, even Iris thinks that Margaret is the one stealing. The dramatic scene of Margaret being walked out is painful, especially when it's revealed for certain it's not her, but true to her fearlessness, she does not go out without a fight. Iris finds out that it's Cleo just like Margaret suspected from the start and seeks a restitution that also winds up transforming her.Just like the characters had a special moment in time that could never come again, so to did these actors. Collette was just a few years in America having been successful in her native Australia. Posey was making a name for herself as the quirky indie film girl. Kudrow was at the height of visibility with Friends and branching off into movies. Don't know much about Ubach. All in all, a great, quiet, strangely uneasy movie that should be seen more than once.

Why? Well, if one looked at the poster and the summary. in reality, it's mostly a drama, and deeper than I had expected going into it. The four leads are very strong, and while she has the most screen time, Collette does not have the showiest role. That would be Parker Posey who is great at this type of role. Lisa Kudrow's character is also something we've seen from her before, but she's so fantastic at it. She's not as over-the-top as her character in Friends, but she gives it so much nuance and quiet humor, the type that'd be surprising if I already didn't know how great of an actress she was. This is definitely recommended.

While that film is more mail-oriented and houses a lot of obscurities and quirks that can only be found in cinema, Clockwatchers is more female-oriented and grounded in reality. Pairing the two up in one of those His vs. Hers double feature DVD sets with a cardboard spinner that allows the couple to humanly settle which film they get to watch first would be an ideal move for these films.It's evident that Sprecher (who co-wrote the flick with her sister Karen) has had some experience with working in an office or a cubicle, and portrays the hell of working in one in a way that one could easily relate. Every minor detail is accentuated appropriately (and annoyingly in a fitting way) such as the clacking of keyboard keys, the ringing of the telephone, the stock music on the radio that allegedly increases employee productivity, and the sounds of overpriced leather shoes hitting the cheap, furnished rugs in the offices of these white collar prisons.Yes, we the film is set in the nine-to-five hellhole that is Global Credit, an archetypal firm that employs a number of executives and office tempts that are easily-replaceable and dehumanized on the spot. We begin on Iris's (Toni Collette) first day there, which is burdened by feelings of inferiority and blandness. That is until she meets fellow tempts, such as the sassy Margaret (Parker Posey), the happy hour-hunter Paula (Lisa Kudrow), and Jane (Alanna Ubach), who is engaged to an unfaithful man. The girls bond, obviously because they know the stress, hell, and the feelings of uselessness that exists when you work as a tempt in a cookie-cutter office building.Their relationship carries the film to several heights, some of which frightening, some of which emotionally-testing, all of which entertaining on some level. Sprecher gives these women real problems and time to show them over the course of ninety-one minutes. It helps, too, that she utilizes a cast of pure champions, especially Toni Collette, who plays shy and nervous excellently, all the while holding the persona of a character trying to do the right thing in the face of a conflict. Having her assisted by actresses like Posey, Kudrow, and Ubach are something of an indie miracle.In addition, there is smart, believable focus on the people who work outside of the girls' circle in the office. One man in particular is hugely protective over the office supplies, such as staples (not his red stapler, though), pencils, paper, and his prized-possession - a rubber-band ball. We're also told that when times get really mundane and the work becomes an endless drudge, people around the office purposely start drama with others. For instance, Margaret steals the man's rubber-band ball for the fun of it. And eventually, someone begins stealing something of everyone's, causing an office uproar.Clockwatchers, like Office Space, will be enjoyed and appreciated by the people who've unfortunately had to endure the drudgery both films amplify on the big-screen. It makes me wonder if working at a low to medium rank in a corporate office is better or any more rewarding than working a register or stocking at your archetypal minimum wage. There are serious truths about the white collar world - how dehumanizing workers is a regular event, how the overworked are undervalued, and the constant fear of replacement never subsides - and Clockwatchers explores it maturely and, to some even, in an eye-opening manner.Starring Toni Collette, Parker Posey, Lisa Kudrow, and Alanna Ubach. Directed by Jill Sprecher.

And the nice thing was how they actually welcomed a lot of that tedium because at least it was a job.  The thief subplot was a little obvious, since I could tell who did it immediately, but how they used it was unique.

But it also wants to be a comedy and a redemption story, showing how even the most invisible human beings can either manage to assert their personality, as Margaret (Parker Posey) does, or salvage their integrity, as does Iris.

An enjoyable ensemble flick with the austere and vanilla feel of the office environment, Clockwatchers focuses on the most taken-for-granted office worker and reminds us that nothing is forever and, in a way, we're all temps. A fresh little flick to kill time with after work.

The movie is one long, dull thud.As usual, the culprit is the screenplay. Its worst flaw of all -the kiss of death for something that portends to be a comedy - is that there isn't a single funny line in the whole movie! Not one! My God, I laughed more during SAVING PRIVATE RYAN!As for the characters and plot - well, characters in this movie don't arc, they just sort of crackle every once in a while. The characters don't even have much personality to begin with; what little Posey's character does possess is solely a byproduct of the actor's own sassy self-confidence. The screenwriters' attempt to inject intrigue into their lives is shallow and short-lived. Bizarre hints of a sexual tryst between Kudrow's character and another character's fiancee are just that, and never evolve into anything more. We actually learn less about the characters as the movie progresses, until it ends with an unapologetically predictable ending.Don't even bother renting this. If you do, demand your money back beforehand.

I must give the director some respect for taking chances on making a movie that is soooo dull, but ending with a good statement.  The truth is, although I liked the plot, I don't know if I really like the foundation it was put on.  If I had to change the movie to make it better, I'd change the whole movie.       The main reason why I went and saw this movie, was because  critics and the movie trailors were calling this a mystery. Calling this movie a mystery is parallel to wondering what is in school food.  So I went and saw it thinking there would be a twist in the end, like The Game.  Ummm. . . well there was a minor twist in the end, but a very disappointing one.  First of all, this movie was very long-winded.  The movie should've been more faster pace. I think the only thing that saved this movie, was that there was a good point made in the end.  Kudrow gave some laughs, Posey had some moments, and the comic relief, or you could say, the pause or boring relief from the mailboy (the guy who played the virgin from Scream).

Temp workers have become a fixture in society, and I thought this movie about temps would be interesting, entertaining, maybe informative?I was wrong.  This movie was so slow and self-consciously arty that I wanted to claw my eyes out before it was half over.  Luckily, I fell asleep before I could permanently harm myself.Remember that scene in Planes, Trains, and Automobiles when Steve Martin's character tells John Candy's character that his stories should have a point, that that makes it so much more interesting to the listener?  Same principle applies here. I applaud the filmmakers' willingness to explore this subject, but they only had enough material for a trailer, and filled up the rest with long silences, the incessant elevator music, and camera angles for the sake of camera angles.Save your money.

The camera angles can be interesting here and there, but it's an office setting, so the production design, after a while, becomes overly familiar and induces (much like the real office place) fantasies of sleep.High points  Parker Posey has a truly hilarious moment in a scene at a happy hour buffet.  Lisa Kudrow does some good work as the office slut and would-be actress.Low points While Toni Collette has an expressively sullen face, after a while you just see way too much of it.

The list is a long one, so I won't bore you, which is what this movie did to me. Then again if you're going to base an entire movie on the endless ennui and excruciating pettiness in a mealy-mouthed, small-minded office, then it's difficult not to be overwhelmed by boredom.Simply put, this would have worked as a 45-minute exercise. But stretching it to 95 minutes just didn't work. It's crying out for severe criticism. We got the point of this flick at the 30-minute mark. The rest was spent trying to convince us that we have a tendency to get too comfortable, even when our circumstances are eroding our capacity for thought. We don't move on until external forces compel us to do so.Toni Collette and Parker Posey were the whole show here. The rest of the players, including Kudrow, Elliot, Balaban and Dooley, really had nothing to do. The script must have looked great to Collette and Posey. Why the others signed on is anyone's guess.The sound quality of the DVD I rented was poor. I had to crank up the volume a number of times to hear what the characters, particularly Posey, were saying. Doesn't really matter anyway. This film is interesting, but far, far too long.

I do realize that the humor is supposed to be subtle. But it asks the question how far can a satire go before it stops being comedic and starts becoming an imitation of real life? Here. Brian Cox's character in Adaptation. said that something has to happen in a film in response to an innocent question from Charlie Kaufman. Something tells me he would have hated this film.I'm reluctant to say that Clockwatchers effectively captures what it's like to be a temp, mostly because I have never worked as a temp. But only a few minutes into the running length, it started to at least seem like someone had done their fair share of suffering as a temp in the past. Clockwatchers presents temps as the plankton of the office space food chain, people who are only noticed when they do something wrong. This point is driven home when Toni Collette's character Iris is told to wait for someone to give her instructions on her new job, and ends up waiting two hours. Finally, a woman comes, and she asks Iris why she didn't tell someone she had been waiting for two hours. This question is rhetorical to everyone but the oblivious woman. Even if she had, would anyone have had actually responded? The four characters are each an archetype of the office workspace that prove to be more complex as the film progresses (sort of like the Breakfast Club). In fact, one thing that I noticed about Clockwatchers is that the way it depicts office life is strikingly similar to high school. Iris eats her lunch in a bathroom stall in the hopes no one will discover her, the new temps are ignored, and everyone is quick to point fingers. Iris represents the new temp, while Margaret is the sardonic temp less than happy with her surroundings (and I also noticed Margaret acts insulted when she is considered as the possible office supplies thief, yet early in the film she takes a set of shot glasses from a bar without much thought.), Lisa Kudrow plays an aspiring actress, and Jane is the meek worker.Also in Clockwatchers are the people around these four characters, all of whom seem weathered by the monotony of office life. They hoard their staples and rubber band balls as if they were priceless treasures, and only emerge from their cubicles to scold the temps and leave. Even something like disappearing office supplies is enough to have tongues wagging. If the four temps represent Molly Ringwald, Judd Nelson, and Emilio Estevez, the office workers represent the parents who desperately try to stay hip.In the end, Clockwatchers provides some interesting points, but it is nearly overshadowed by its flaws. Its most present one to me was the fact it's virtually plot less, and not in a good way at all. In addition to being boring, it provides another question When the film is over, are the workers going to realize the waste office work is and stop ignoring the temps? Like the one question said early in the movie, the answer should be pretty obvious.

She makes several friends who are also temps, but she is never really accepted by other employees.  The company is not pleasant to work for--the bosses are not shown being really mean, but they just don't truly appreciate their employees. The temps are bored, and most people at the company tend to do as little as they can get away with.  Though I have to admit, there doesn't seem to be enough work for the number of people in that office. A couple of examples of the company's attitude--after some thefts, new rules are made and security measures such as cameras are added, and the bosses are always suspicious.  Then there is the music--Muzak, elevator music, dentist's office--whatever you want to call it.  I'm one of the few people who actually likes that music, and it made the movie worth seeing for me, though the music could have been used more in some scenes where it wouldn't fit, just for irony. Parkey Posey was great as usual.  Margaret was charming and almost perky but also cynical and prone to cheating and stealing whenever she felt she could get away with it.  She wanted a better career but was having a hard time moving forward.  I enjoyed some, but not all, of the scenes with her character.  Lisa Kudrow was perky, beautiful and slightly ditzy as an aspiring actress. I assume Toni Collette did a good job as Iris.  I just didn't care much for her character, who wanted more out of life just like her co-workers and occasionally narrated.  Her father wanted her to work at his company, International Foods, but she didn't seem motivated to do that for some reason.This seemed to be a pretty good movie.  There was some comedy, even if the movie tended to be depressing.  Something about it suggested an art film that might appeal to, say, Woody Allen fans.  It just wasn't really my kind of movie.

But Sprecher's view of the modern day corporate office (a red-tape festooned, sterile hell where the temps twiddle their thumbs doing nothing and no one really knows if they're alive or dead) is decades out of date. The women refer here and there to their various dilemmas, and these sound like they ought to have real resonance (Kudrow's false pregnancy; her alleged acting career which it's implied she may be lying about; Ubach's coming marriage which it's implied may be no good for her) but the movie lets them all drift away - this is probably reflective of the transient nature of office friendships, but leaves the movie feeling unfinished and unresolved. When we get to the end (consisting of a generic note of rather vague   philosophizing about the passage of time and paths of life) the isolated moments basically seem to have worked despite the whole rather than within it.

That's her big breakthrough after an hour and a half of being very mousey and shy. The four temps who look so playful and happy on the box cover are miserable in the movie, partly because they're temps and partly because they don't possess the ambition or skills to be much more than that.
