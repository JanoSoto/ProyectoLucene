A lot of us considered it one of the best movies ever made. Despite the fact that there is some serious license taken with reality, the movie captures the intensity and high stakes of OCS, and how people who barely know each other become bonded so quickly; how the least likely candidates sometimes become the star performers; how some people are changed beyond recognition by the experience. There was never a lack of old hands like Sid's father, telling you you had it easy because of some difference in the rules he didn't enjoy 10 years earlier. DOR is translated by Foley as drop on request. In 1983, the terminology was DE, which meant dis enroll. I always wondered what happened to the candidates in my class who DE'd. The ones who graduated I kept running into in the fleet, sometimes in places like the Philippines. The most unrealistic thing about the movie was the premise that local girls want to marry officer candidates. Not so in Pensacola or Newport RI, where OCS was in those days. The locals actually called us behind our backs cockroaches because we wore all black and had to run away to our barracks by 10 pm. The second most unrealistic thing was the foul language. That comes later, in the fleet, but not in OCS. No we did not have martial arts duels. All in all, however, the essence of the experience, if not the specifics, is found in the movie. One of our marching songs went left right left right / you HAD a good job and you LEFT / you're RIGHT! We really did have nowhere else to go. I say 10 stars. The VHS version gets only 8 because of changes to the soundtrack songs.

Richard Gere embodies the character of Zack Mayo, a troubled young man who, due to neglect and ill parenting by a military father, signs up with the Navy to get some direction in his misguided life.Mayo's life is made even harder by the ball-busting Sergeant Foley (Louis Gossett Jr.) upon his arrival at the barracks, and he struggles to find his place. However, he does find it in himself to stand-up to the overbearing Foley and his own inner-demons and, during the course of the film, goes from being selfish, weak and undisciplined to considerate, strong and determined. His will, as well as the love of the beautiful Paula (Debra Winger) and the guidance of Foley, makes him stay the course and lifts him 'up where he belongs'.Richard Gere is great in adding layers to what could have been a poorly drawn characterisation. Mayo is not always the 'good guy' and is more often than not a complete prick. Nevertheless, he undertakes a journey of self-discovery where he refuses to become a carbon copy of his father and takes hold of his own destiny, turning himself into the man he wants to be. Gere has never been better on film than when he screams, `I got nowhere else to go!' at Foley in such a heartbreaking howl that the audience can literally feel his pain.Debra Winger is also good as Paula, a downtrodden factory girl trapped in a small-minded small town with a lack of opportunities for women. She not only finds a way out in her love for Mayo, but the hope of a better future somewhere else. Louis Gossett Jr. also stands out as the foul-mouthed, domineering Sergeant Foley who proves to be pivotal in Mayo's journey.With a great soundtrack, strong performances and the most rousing and emotional final scene in a film since 'Rocky', 'An Officer And A Gentleman' deserves its place among the classics of film history.

I would assume it was used because the true locale for AOCS, Pensacola, FL, wasn't suitable for some reason. Officer candidates going to AOCS already have their degrees and are undergoing training, physical and educational, to earn their commission. No, it's not four years like the Naval Academy, but then again, it's not four years of hell at the Academy, as another reviewer attempted to posit. Any officer commissioned through AOCS is an officer just like an academy grad and both, ultimately, can end up with regular commissions vice reserve commissions.Next, the training at AOCS was fairly accurately portrayed in the movie. Lots of running, swimming, academics, inspections, etc. all intended to result in the individual becoming part of a team. Another reviewer, obviously not a Republican (LOL), detests this movie just because of his perception that it endorsed the philosophy of the Reagan years. Utter balderdash, of course. What this movie portrays, again fairly accurately, is the growth of a loner into someone who realizes, as Spock so eloquently stated in one of the Star Trek movies, (t)he needs of the many outweigh the needs, or the wants, of the one or the few. Mayo learns to be part of a team; he learns to care for others and cease being a user of people in his life...an example he learned from his father.The terminology, during the 80s when I went through AOCS, was still DOR...Drop On Request. It was an out exercised by very few people, mostly because those of us in AOCS were already motivated to come into the Navy and specifically into Naval Aviation. The rigors, as stated previously, are presented fairly accurately although a little melodramatic in places, e.g., the altitude chamber. Never in all my years in the Navy did I see anyone freak out in the chamber, which is a required test, along with swim quals, every four years to remain qualified to fly.The legend of the Pensacola Debs was presented to us early on in AOCS. Yes, there are stories, many of them true, of men meeting their wives while going through training in Penasacola, but I'd wager there's not a higher incidence in P'cola than there is at any military base or college town for that matter. Odd, but you put men and women in the same room and some will pair off, and some will marry and remain together forever. The bar in the film, TJ's, was based on a bar in Penascola named Trader Jon's. Trader had a running deal that if you caught him wearing matching socks, you'd get some prize...can't remember if it was money or drinks. Let's just say, he never paid off as far as I know. Trader died a few years back, but I'm pretty sure some of the stuff from his bar is probably at the Naval Aviation Museum at NAS Pensacola.The Drill Instructor portrayal by Louis Gossett is VERY true to life! While they cussed us, screamed at us, pushed us physically and looked for what would trip us up, they also, in retrospect, wanted us to succeed. One thing they never did, and would have been severely disciplined for, was hit us, so the fight scene, while improbable, works in the movie. PTing us into the ground, though...you bet they did! This movie works for me because I lived the life both during the AOCS part and during a career in the Navy in aviation. The portrayals are pretty much spot-on and believable. Sure there's dramatic license, but there is in any movie! Anyone who believes Full Metal Jacket tells it like it is is delusional; there's plenty of dramatic license there, too. Relax, enjoy the movie. It's about personal growth, love, and sacrifice; all in all good things. Not the best movie ever made, but certainly not the worst!

I read once that his role of Zach Mayo was first offered to John Denver.  It is impossible to think of anyone else in the role which is one indication of how good Gere was.      Lou Gossett, Jr. steals the show and gets a deserved Oscar as Gunnery Sergeant Foley.  Debra Winger is also delectable as Paula, Zach's working class girlfriend.       I had read that Winger had a real problem doing the nude scenes with Gere and felt very uncomfortable being undressed in front of the camera.  Supposedly the scene in which she is crying while making love to Zach isn't because she's feeling passion, it is because she is feeling humiliated.  The movie also had to snip out a couple of seconds of Winger flexing her hips a bit too much during a bed scene.  Still one of the steamiest bed scenes in film history.      The most riveting moment of the movie is when Foley is going to kick Zach out of the program and Gere frantically and desperately screams DON'T YOU DO THAT!  I AIN'T GOT NOWHERE ELSE TO GO!  All of Zach's arrogance is drained out of him and he is just a desperate kid begging for the only chance he'll ever have.  Powerful moment.  In the end, Zach gains maturity.

The scenerio were she finally makes it over due to Mayo's newfound concern and trust of others is also great and shows his maturing.

While the film may certainly follow the general formulaic outlines of the genre, director Taylor Hackford and screenwriter Douglas Day Stewart dodge sentimentalization with a healthy dosage of grim reality. This is no longer the ultra-glamorized world of old Hollywood; AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN is a movie about love in the real world. By not sheltering it's lovers from the harsh nature of humanity, the film manages to have a significantly greater impact as it works toward a deservedly optimistic ending.In a role turned down by both John Travolta and John Denver, Richard Gere lends a brooding intensity that electrifies what could have been a bland protagonist. Debra Winger, with her down-home sexiness at it's peak, turns in a fascinating portrayal of small town frustration, and Louis Gossett Jr nearly steals the picture in a harrowing, Oscar-winning performance. In fact, Gere's relationship with Gossett's Drill Sargent is just as involving as his love affair with Winger. The supporting cast is also well-cast, with David Keith, Robert Loggia, and Lisa Blount delivering standout performances.

I really hate that term, because I know every guy has seen a so-called chick flick and went away at least liking it.  Ok, maybe AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN is one of those type of films, but one thing is certain....it kicks TOP GUN's A**!!!  This is film is about the rigorous training to become a pilot, while GUN shows a bunch of guys involved in dogfights that play like video games (I heartily agree with Leonard Maltin).  ***SPOILERS AHEAD***    Richard Gere, in one of his best roles (second only to PRIMAL FEAR), plays Zachary Mayo, a loner who goes to Navy Candidate School to become a pilot because simply, that's all he wants to do.  He finds a real challenge in the drill instructor Foley, played unforgettably by Louis Gossett, Jr. (who won an Oscar).  He also finds love for the first time in his life, in the form of a poor factory worker (Debra Winger).  His best friend Worley (David Keith) finds love too...but it doesn't turn out the way he wanted.  Much of the film alternates between in his growing relationship with Winger and the rigourous training he endures, which become more important to him than ever when Foley order him to quit after doing so illegal....he, however, refuses to give up for anything in this world (the famous emotional climax is when he confesses I've got nowhere else to go.).     Personally, I see this film as most certainly not a chick flick, but a film that has something for both sequences in equal doses; more females will appreciate the romance, while more males will root for Mayo as he overcomes many obstacles, most notably Foley.  I must confess, however, that my favorite sequence in the whole film is the last one, showing Gere carry Winger out of her factory.  There is a much more emotional scene, however, that I will definately not give away; I've never met anyone who wasn't moved by it (when you see it, you will find out!).         In addition to the cast, the film also features great direction by Taylor Hackford and a well-written (if having the standard number of minute flaws) screenplay by Douglas Day Stewart.  The lovely score is done by Jack Nitzsche, and it also features the classic love song Up Where We Belong by Joe Cocker & Jennifer Warnes (which, I must say, is way better than Berlin's song from TOP GUN, though both won Oscars).  Still, the performances are what makes this film and it succeeds, making it one of the most romantic films of all time.  Fav. Quote Only two things come out of Oklahoma  Steers and Queers.

If you enjoy romance, it is a ten star movie. The movie is cleverly written, becoming a Naval Aviator is delineated well from both class directions. Mayo is a poor, street tough orphan loner who trusts nobody. Cruelly abused by his loser father, he in completely withdrawn inside of himself. He is a borderline criminal and knows how to find the interstices within any rule system. This is what almost gets him thrown out. Where the writing has depth is that there is moral and class duality across the two dyads of female and male. Sid, Mayo's friend, if the exact class opposite; he is from privilege and wealth. The pressure is just as great for he must meet family expectations. His is the tragic center of the story and a wonderful dis-abuser of idiots who think wealth is the gateway to happiness. He cannot meet his family's standards and he destroys himself. The movie is not a clichéd, trite, jingoistic piece of propaganda. It is surprisingly intense and realistic. The two women seeking naval aviator husbands also have a duality about them but this one is moral not economic. Lynette and Paula both go to the Naval dances hoping to snag a Naval Aviator. Paula has some ethics about the affair, there are lines she will not cross. Lynette takes no prisoners and is the cause of Sid's suicide. She feigns love for Sid but watch, when he drops out, how cruelly she dumps him like a sack of garbage.Gossett's Foley is the star of the movie tough and no nonsense but not heartless. When Zack's black market escapades are discovered, Foley pushes him to the breaking point, when he hears he has nothing else on this earth; Foley has mercy on him and let's him stay. This is the treasure of the movie, Foley appears heartless like Hartman, in Full Metal Jacket, but he is not. Again, after Sid's suicide, Zack snaps and demands a full contact karate match with Foley. Foley again let's him stay. The movie depicts moral and economic contrasts between people realistically. This is not a sugar coated happy land. Sid's parents and Lynette drive Sid over the edge. Foley sees the flaws within Mayo but shows him mercy and understanding for the flaws of his background that result in criminal predilections. My seven only reflects the depth of romance within the narrative. If you like romantic dramas, this is a nine or ten. Remember, you are reading a philosopher's review of a romantic drama. I am not exactly up to my eyeballs in romance. There is a beauty about the movie. Despite Foley's toughness, Gossett earned his Oscar by giving his character great empathy and compassion though they are buried deep down. The path and development of Paula and Zack with the existential failures of Sid and Lynette are examples of great writing with moral depth. The path of becoming is always fraught with peril. The movie is Taylor Hackford's zenith as a director, his other efforts The Devil's Advocate, Against All Odds, simply are manifestly inferior to this one that won many deserved awards.

Richard Gere along with such various and diverse people as David Keith, Tony Plana, and one female recruit Lisa Eilbacher are training to be Naval Pilots and they've got a Marine gunnery sergeant putting them through their paces during the training near Puget Sound. The sergeant is Lou Gossett, Jr. and he's looking for whatever weaknesses, academic, physical, professional or moral to wash them out of the program.The film turns on the conflict between Gere and Gossett. Gere thinks he's something special and Gossett is going to prove to him he's not. Gere shows he does have the right stuff, take careful note of the scene on the confidence course with Lisa Eilbacher where he shows he's not just about himself.Gossett casts so well in military parts, but this one set the standard for playing training sergeants. Many have done it before, but Gossett's is the best by far. His peers must have thought so because not only did he win the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for 1982, but Gossett beat out two Hollywood veterans either James Mason for The Verdict or Robert Preston for Victor/Victoria should have been a sentimental favorite. The moral failings in the trainees are brought out by town girls Debra Winger and Lisa Blount. Both are types that Gossett warns his trainees about, town girls who are on the make and want to trap a glamorous Navy Pilot to get out of their factory town. Not too much different from sorority girls at Ivy League schools looking to snare a husband. Winger and Blount go after Gere and Keith respectively. It ends in tragedy for one of them. Debra got a Best Actress nomination, but lost to Meryl Streep for Sophie's Choice.I wish somehow David Keith had been given some recognition. For me his is the most touching performance in the whole film. He's doing the program out of some sense of instilled obligation, not really because he wants to. It's between this and the country kid prisoner part that Keith did so well in Brubaker as being his career roles.An Officer And A Gentleman got a few more nominations in technical categories, but 1982 was the year of Gandhi which was the big winner. But it did receive a second Oscar for Best Song with Up Where We Belong which was a big old hit that year. You could hardly go anywhere without hearing Jennifer Warren's hit on somebody's radio. No contest in the voting in that category.There have been a lot of films about military training, but the special performances by the whole cast make An Officer And A Gentleman a really outstanding film, the best in the genre.

But it's as much a film about determination as it is love, in finding strengths from within to achieve ones goals against seemingly badly stacked odds. It really is a film that essays that triumph of the will spirit so lacking in many similar pictures that followed this 1982 piece. There are some incredibly great sequences here, chiefly during the training programme, from Mayo's continuing conflict with Sgt Foley, to a devastating turn of events with a friendship. This film royally packs an emotional punch.The cast are uniformly excellent, Richard Gere as Mayo is pitch perfect and it pays to notice that he was a 32 year old man playing an early 20s rookie, it's a testament to his undervalued ability that nobody noticed. Debra Winger was nominated for a Best Actress Award for her portrayal as Mayo's love interest, Paula Pokrifki. It's believed that Gere and herself didn't get on off screen, it isn't noticeable, tho, because the chemistry sizzles and the resulting end product is one of a joyous return.

I was invested even after knowing the outcome.I have seen this film 10+ times now, and each time I view it, I appreciate the acting skills involved. I can only hazard a guess that this set was not a friendly one to actors; but dayum did they all deliver.Over time, this could break my top 25 of all time.It is very worthy of a review if you haven't already.

Richard Gere portrays Zachary Mayo, a young man and son of a career sailor who has risen from residing above a house of ill repute in the Philippines to becoming an officer's candidate destined to fly jets.Gere is terrific as Mayo, and works incredibly hard to combine the complex emotions of the character with his seemingly, simplistic facade.  Gere is supported by a great cast including Debra Winger as the young factory worker who yearns of a better life with Mayo, David Keith as a cadet who's not all that he seems, and the legendary Louis Gossett, Jr. as Gunnery Sgt. Emil Foley, Mayo's adamant and hard-edged drill instructor who remains Zach's total bane of existence.  Gossett won a well-deserved Oscar for this role, and he remains the true highlight of this film.Some have called An Officer and a Gentlemen out-dated, improbable, and too melodramatic, and perhaps it is all of these.  But, it is so entertaining and so enthralling, I find it easily to become enveloped by the picture's story and characters.  You want them all to succeed, and you feel for them when they fail.  This is the true mark of a truly great film.Highly recommended.

Not once did I feel that Sgt.

Equally, Lisa Blout carries a wonderful performance of a young, selfish girl who is torn between her compassion and her dreams.Richard Gere is at his best.  The scenes where Mayo is forced to deal with his emotions are riveting and even better are the scenes were Mayo has to deal with Sgt. Foley.  Gossett Jr. and Gere play great opposite each other.This movie is a great love story as well as an honest portrayal of a man being forced to deal with his mixed emotions in a search for inner peace and a life as a gentleman.

The story supposedly relates the triumph and transfiguration of white trash Richard Gere into the naval aviator of the film's title, following his introduction to the usual hazards of cadet life punishing training exercises, antagonistic drill sergeants, conniving debutantes, and so forth. Debra Winger is one of the latter, and the uncomplicated blue-collar appeal of her character helps to alleviate the often tortured exposition of the hero's rite of passage. The film's most obvious shortcoming is its unfocused script (which needs to develop a second, parallel love story to throw the first into relief), followed by Richard Gere's total inability to appear sensitive or insecure. The enormous success of the movie can be traced to the marketing skills of its producers, who wisely sold it as a slice of glossy, inspirational junk food. Enjoy it as such, but don't expect the memory to linger.

When she killed herself Zack followed his father to the Philippines where he got on in life the hard way. Now he is an adult he is determined to make more of himself than his father did&#x85; to become a naval aviator&#x85; to become an officer and a gentleman. Before he can do that though he must pass the thirteen week course at the Aviation Officer Candidate School where those who don't have what it takes are weeded out. His instructor Gunnery Sergeant Emil Foley doesn't think he has what it takes but he will push him and the rest of the class to the limit to find out. Zack befriends fellow student Sid Worley and the two of them start dating Paula and Lynette, a pair of local girls, despite Foley's warning that the local girls are all trying to get married to a pilot by fair means or foul.This film may be well known as a romance, largely due to the famous final scene, but it is far more than just that. In fact the most important relationship in the film is that between Mayo and Foley; Foley may be pushing Mayo to quit but without him he'd never get through the course; what at first appears to be bullying turns out to be the impetus needed to get through the gruelling training programme. Louis Gossett, Jr. certainly earned the Oscar he won for his performance as Foley and Gere is at his best as Mayo whose character develops from a selfish loner to that of somebody willing to help his classmates at his own expense. The rest of the cast are pretty good too; most notably David Keith who plays Sid and Debra Winger who plays Paula. For the most part we can guess how the story will ultimately end but that doesn't make it an entirely feel-good film; there is tragedy too and that comes as quite a shock. Overall an enjoyable film; well worth watching especially if you are a fan of Richard Gere. "},{"Title":"The best of its kind","Date":"21 January 2014","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" Released in 1982, An Officer and a Gentleman was the obvious inspiration of films like Tom Cruise's Top Gun and Days of Thunder. An Officer and a Gentleman was the first and best, by far.The plot similarities are obvious They all include the angry young man who needs to prove his gifting, the uncompromising mentor, the encouraging babe, the craft, the arena and the doomed buddy. In An Officer the angry young man is Richard Gere as Mayo, the mentor is Louis Gossett Jr. as Drill Instructor Folely, the babe is Paula (Debra Winger), the craft is aviation basic training, the arena is a Naval academy and the Puget Sound area of Washington (shot on location) and the buddy is Sid Worley (David Keith).Thankfully, the film doesn't get bogged down telling the back-story of Mayo. Instead, it ingeniously shares his past in a matter of minutes at the very beginning. It's all we need to know to understand why Mayo is the way he is. And then we're off to basic training where he's tested. Does he have what it takes? Can someone as lowborn, aloof and un-trusting as Mayo make it as an officer?Debra Winger and Lisa Blount shine here as Mayo and Worley's babes. Winger is alluring in a humble girl next door type of way (she out-shined Lynda Carter as Wonder Girl on Wonder Woman, which is hard to believe), but Blount is even more alluring -- yes, despite the negative aspects of her character. I'll just put it this way, she really fills out a pair of jeans, lol. Both couples get intimate way too quickly, but maybe this is one of the flaws of the Puget Debs and explains why they have a problems getting marriage material, if you know what I mean. Besides this, time has to be condensed in a two-hour film.BOTTOM LINE If you're in the mood for a film of this ilk An Officer and a Gentleman is the best of the lot.GRADE AINSIGHTS ABOUT THE ENDING (***SPOILER ALERT*** Don't read further unless you've seen the film)An officer is a military leader. Drill Instructor Foley's job is to weed out those who can't hack it as an officer. It's an important job because people's lives in combat are dependent on the quality of the leaders and Foley takes his job seriously.Foley rightly pegs Mayo as a lowlife loner from the outset -- a wannabe officer -- and therefore puts on the pressure. This is especially so on the one weekend where he has Mayo to himself. Foley does everything he can to make Mayo break AND quit, but Mayo doesn't. He breaks, indeed, but he refuses to quit on the grounds that he has no where to go. At the end of this scene you can see that Foley develops respect for Mayo (which you get a glimpse of earlier when Mayo does extremely well on the obstacle course).Later, Mayo disregards breaking the record on the obstacle course (which he was definitely able to do) in order to encourage Seegar (the female recruit) to finally make it over the wall. Foley sees that Mayo's no longer the aloof and selfish loner he was when he rode in on his motorcycle. He's matured; he's developed character. It was already there, of course, but the boot camp training has brought it to the fore, and Foley sees it.After Worley's tragic death, Mayo confronts Foley while he's drilling the platoon. Foley informs Mayo that they all know what happened and even tells him they're sorry about Worley. He didn't have to do this and it shows that Foley isn't just an honorable man, but also that he cared about Worley. After all, Worley was only one week away from graduating! In a sense, he was one of Foley's kids. In other words, Foley and the platoon were grieving too. But Mayo was closest to Worley and he's crazy with shock & grief at this point. He insists that he's going to quit, to which Foley tells him to meet him for a fight. Sure, there's some testosterone in his words, but he actually does this out of respect for Mayo as a last ditch effort to keep him from dropping out.And Foley doesn't kick his axx, as some claim. It was essentially an even match and Foley barely walks off the mat, which is the only reason he technically wins. But that's inconsequential. The purpose of the fight was to run Mayo's steam out so he didn't make a rash decision in an obvious moment of grief & anger. Foley accomplished his purpose. Once Mayo was no longer blinded by rage he makes the right choice and graduates.This is why he thanks Foley at the end.

Well not totally I guess, probably 51% for females, 49% for males if any of that stereotyping means anything to you.Anyway this is a movie I've seen numerous times, and it's the type of flick that if I'm channel-surfing and come upon it, I will usually leave it on.  I can't really put my finger on it but for some reason it never disappoints.  It's just one of those movies.Not that it doesn't have its faults.  If you've ever been in the military you will be asked to accept a lot that is improbable along with several technical glitches.  Just understand that this is a movie for the general public and not a documentary on life in recruit training (of any branch, enlisted or officer) and you'll enjoy it a lot more.I can still remember distinctly Gene Shallatt reviewing this film on a morning show and saying how good Louis Gossett Jr. was as Drill Instructor Foley and that it made him homesick for his old Drill Sergeant.  Because I was going away to basic training in a few months this sounded like a good film to take in, and it was.  Of course my boot camp was nothing like this, but that didn't make this any less of a film in my opinion.  And just to clarify even when this was filmed political correctness was already creeping into the ranks and my Drills never once used profanity, and that was the same year (82) this was released so Foley's ribald,  scurrilous (though highly entertaining) cadance calls were already an anachronism at that point.Bottom line here though is that this is a great love story, and incidently includes one of the best love scenes in movie history (followed by a touching moment when the reserved Zach opens up to Paula who automatically presumes he is being facetious).  This is a great scene and Winger proves herself a very capable and sexy actress.The ending is, of course, classic.  It freezes the two, she in his arms, at the apogee of their love affair, and suspends them forevermore in bliss.  That's a good thing because I think we all have that uncomfortable feeling that there is no way that relationship is going to make it.  But then again that's why we like Hollywood I guess.

It pretty much sums up the story of Richard Gere's aviation midshipman undergoing a tough training course in the Northwest. He comes from a seedy background and is mean and selfish. He meets a girl from the nearby factory, Deborah Winger, whom he relies on for sex and comfort during his 12-weeks of misery. She, in turn, is the daughter of an unknown aviation cadet in a class twenty-two years ago, and is looking for a way out of this dead-end existence through marriage to a naval aviator. The two meet at a dance, exit the premises, go down to the beach and boff -- he for kicks, she because she's loose and likes him. Will Richard Gere overcome his egocentricity? Will he graduate as an ensign and go on to flight school? Will he realize that his feelings for Winger are more than those he would feel for just another play toy? Will be become an officer AND a gentleman? Answer You don't need a Magic 8-ball.It's kind of an interesting movie. It's certainly one of Gere's best performances. Under the torment of Lou Gossett Jr.'s Gunnery Sergeant, he's at one point reduced to a mud-covered tortured shambles and screams out abjectly, I got no place else to GO! His face is all twisted out of its handsomeness and his usual arrogance is nowhere in sight.Winger's role is rather more complicated. If Gere's principal concern must shift from himself to the other members of the team, well, it does so on cue. But Winger's motives are ambiguous from the beginning, even to herself. She's interested in Gere from the start, yes, but she's also interested in HER career as an ordinary bourgeois, fixing bacon and eggs for her man in some exotic locale perhaps, bearing him children. Her motives don't change so much as they intensify as she comes to bond with Gere. And yet, rather than trap him with a false pregnancy or something, she's willing to give him up when he shows signs of reluctance to pursue their affair beyond the stage of an amuse-bouche.Speaking of fake pregnancies, that's part of the subplot involving David Keith, a fellow classmate, and HIS girlfriend, one of Winger's coworkers at the factory. Keith gives up everything for his supposedly pregnant partner, resigns from the Navy, buys her a wedding ring and immediately proposes marriage so he can take her back to meet the family in Oklahoma where he has a job as floor manager waiting for him at J. C. Penny. FLOOR MANAGER? She is waiting for bread and he brings her stones. Like any sensible shark, she tells him what he can do with his wedding ring. After he goes to a motel and does it, he hangs himself.There is a terrific martial arts slug out at the end in which Gossett, the instructor, manages to save himself only be delivering a hard kick to Gere's family jewels. I haven't quite figured that out yet. Why was an unfair blow necessary? Granted that Gere must discover that he can be defeated. As far as maturity goes, he has a lot of catching up to do. But surely he knows by now that life is unfair, so he doesn't need a painful reminder. Is it just that the writers didn't want to risk showing Richard Gere being beaten in a fair fight? That's kind of how it looks. By the way, writers, when a man is kicked there he doesn't fall to the ground in a fetal position and choke. He falls to the ground in a fetal position and screams bloody murder.The script is part of the problem with this film. Absolutely nobody could be as naive and stupid as David Keith's midshipman. He's a nice guy but he doesn't seem to have any insight at all, into himself or into others. He doesn't deserve to be a naval aviator. He deserves to be a Steward's Mate Third Class.It's as if the writers figured something like, let's put Richard Gere through midshipman training so we can watch him suffer, and then we'll have him fall for Deborah Winger. This schematic skeleton is then fitted out with disproportionate, sometimes flabby limbs and extrusions. The script really needed some buffing, at least as much as a midshipman's buckle. It's a colorful movie, with plenty of interesting action and some nice performances, but it's a bit sloppily done.

You have to buy into the threat to it &#151; there always is one &#151; and then rejoice when true love is set in a way that you know matters.At the same time, the film has to do something quite different, on a different level. It has to add to the aggregate template that you have of what romance is. It can do this is in a mundane way, as most do. Or it can be in some clever way that might enlighten the relationship you have with your life an fantasy in each other. This does neither. I think you will have to be young for it to work for you on either of these levels. Or perhaps you have to be the sort of person who believes that athletic achievement is somehow an indication that you have beaten life. Here's the story a man and woman meet and have sex. He is from a profoundly broken home. She is from one that is broken in a profoundly relevant way, relevant to the story. They are both from low class backgrounds. He has a history of violence. She begins the film as a trollop, scheming to get a high income husband. Some things happen and we end the film supposing to believe that these two will marry and live together happily, even though once during the events he has left her. Why? Because he has endured a grueling physical test. That's all.He is in a track to be a naval officer. Now, that is about a 2 or 3 out of ten statuswise to start, and probably less at the time of the story. It involves having something like a college education and learning to actually fly. You are supposed to also have some qualities peculiar to the military and called leadership. All we see is that he passed the physical filter and instantly he is an officer and a gentleman, and more; instantly he and his girl (who has passed no test whatever) have a romance worth valuing.And more than that even, that it is worth valuing in the special way that film romance is worth entering our lives.You'd have to be pretty desperate to do that.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3 You can find something better to do with this part of your life.

It chronicles his story, mainly through his interactions with his drill sergeant (Sgt. Foley), his buddy (Seeger), and especially his love interest, a local girl named Paula. The factory girls from the small nearby town have set their caps on bagging (sometimes even entrapping, if necessary) husbands from among the class of future officers, in order to improve their social / financial situation. Needless to say, the would be officers, by contrast, are generally seeking one night stands with said girls.Really, the film revolves around Zack and his character development. Certainly as the movie begins, while he may indeed be an officer candidate, clearly he is no gentleman. While not totally despicable, the arrogant candidate isn't a particularly sympathetic character either, perhaps due in part to his troubled family history. His mother committed suicide when he was young and his father, also a military man, essentially ignored him. Thus Zack is training to become a Navy pilot in order to give his life some direction. Richard Gere is utterly is convincing in the role; I cannot imagine any other actor playing it.Louis Gossett Jr. is brilliant as the hard nosed, tough as nails, no nonsense drill sergeant, Foley, who must try to make an officer out of this candidate who, in his opinion, is clearly lacking. There are some dramatic, moving, and emotional scenes between him and Zack. Gossett deserved his Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.I personally really liked Zack's buddy, Casey Seeger, and found his military story and his romance with another factory girl an interesting plot line, especially for comparison with Zack and Paula.However, all that being said, for me this movie is made by the lovely Debra Winger. She brings a real integrity and vulnerability to the role of the working class Paula, a girl with few opportunities and prospects, head over heels in love with a man she knows will almost certainly break her heart. My respect for this marvelous actress went up a further notch when I read from several other commentators that she did not want to do the nude love scene and that the tears falling down her face during this scene were in fact tears of humiliation and not acting for the role. I don't know much of the military and this picture may not be accurate (probably isn't!), but I found it an interesting glimpse into cadet life, training, expectations, and so on.As for the ending, I won't give it away here but it's one of the legends of the cinematic world. A great movie for members of both sexes. As another reviewer cleverly phrased it, grab the popcorn and enjoy.

Upon several viewings, I finally understood the sergeant's true intentions. He's not being mean for the sake of causing unhappiness. He's pushing his recruits outside their comfort zones to see who they really are for the purposes of revealing their strengths and weaknesses. Even during his opening speech, Sergeant Foley (Louis Gossett, Jr, in an academy-award winning role), he tells them he will use methods fair and unfair to expose their weaknesses, and he expects more than half of them to D.O.R., military abbreviation for drop on request.Zack Mayo (Richard Gere in his first acclaimed starring role), an Italian-American in the lower middle-class, has joined the Navy. He wants to become a naval pilot, but he must first endure and persevere through a basic-training program at the hands of one of the toughest sergeants in the Navy before the military will allow him to sit in the pilot's seat of a plane. When the new cadet-trainees line up before Sergeant Foley, he tells them that even before they can start learning how to fly planes, they must prove to him they are of the right material for the job. He scolds them for listening to too much Mick Jaggar music and defaming their country. He then engages them on a rigorous training program which makes other military programs seem like Romper Room by comparison. However, we notice something about Zack from the get-go he's a loner. While the other recruits immediately bond and try to pull for one-another to survive the training, Zack is often on the side, alone. He does befriend one other trainee, Sid Worley (David Keith), a young southerner who has family ties to the military.Foley warns the cadets about the local women looking for officer-pilots to date and possibly marry, but Zach and Sid take no heed and instead go out during evenings to meet women in the local town. Zach finds Paula (Debra Winger in an equally compelling performance), a working girl at a paper factory, and they immediately embark on a relationship. However, Paula is uncertain whether Zach truly loves her or whether he's just using her as temporary companionship and sexual release while he's enduring the trainee torture at the hands of Foley. Sid also meets a woman, Lynette, who desires to marry a pilot. When he is invited to have dinner with Paula's family, Zach learns Paula has had a habit of dating potential pilots, and her father was one such pilot-cadet in the same program. Paula was born out of wedlock.However, Zach has a little secret. He's been trading in a black market of military accoutrements, hiding his inventory above one of the ceiling panels in his dormitory room. He buys them in bulk wholesale from another soldier from a different company who has extra items on hand, and then resells them to his fellows at a profit. Usually the customer-soldier comes to Zach's store when he needs something which looks shiny and new for inspection. Often, if a cadet doesn't pass inspection he or she may lose their time off, so Zach always has customers willing to buy. Then one day, when an African-American recruit is desperate for an item to pass inspection, Sergeant Foley arrives in the room and says In every class, there's always one joker who thinks that he's smarter than me. This is just simply a fine story from beginning to end with a top-notch cast. Gere offers his first challenging performance in which he rises to the occasion, one of many to come during the course of his career. In particular, Louis Gossett almost steals the show as the tough but fair-minded sergeant who desires only the best soldiers for the pilot training program. Apparently, his part was written with a white sergeant in mind, but Gossett makes every piece of dialogue his own, and as far as I know the part was little changed when Gossett was cast. Honorable mention also to Debra Winger as Zach's love interest. An amazing story of growth and transcendence.

Even though An Officer and a Gentleman came out in 1982, six years after I was born, I only just recently stumbled across it recently (sorry for my tardiness), just because my elders talked so much about it so I just wanted to know what the hype was about and to see if it will leave me with a lasting impression.For those who never seen the film it stars Richard Gere as a young man named Zack Mayo who has recently checked himself into the Navy OCS located in Washington. From the early scenes we discover that Mayo's life was not a very pleasant one. At a very young age, his mother killed herself and was forced to stay with his father (Robert Loggia) while stationed in the Philippines. His father's nurturing was absent since all he had on his mind was drinking and chasing prostitutes. Zach wasn't really prepared for the tough regiments that the OCS had to offer as he struggling in terms of handling commitment let alone following authoritative figures.Mayo is under the tutelage of gunnery Sgt. Emil Foley (Louis Gossett Jr.) and it comes to no surprise that their encountering is just on the horizon. Mayo seems to excel quite well on the physical initiatives that the Navy has to offer, but academically is quite the other story. This leads to Mayo forming a friendship with a fellow classmate named Sid Worley (David Keith) as he will do everything he can to get Mayo into the Aerodynamics class in exchange for immaculate belt- buckles and boots whenever there's a barracks inspection. The main setting for this movie is set in the OCS, there's also a vital subplot that involves Zach, Sid and a couple of girls Puget Debs who they meet when they're off campus during their weekend. The two ladies are Paula Pokrifki (Debra Winger) and Lynette Pomeroy (Lisa Blount) who a scrounging for military meat in hopes for a quick marriage proposal. These Puget Debs play riskier attempts to get their catch like faking their pregnancies or other things like that. Paula hooks up with Zach while Lynette is onto Sid.The rest of the way it's Zach trying to get through 13 weeks of OCS training and while getting adjusted to Paula. Since Zach is the titular character, fans seem to pretty much know the outcome of the story, but that doesn't deprive itself from being entertaining. After 33 years, I can safely say that An Officer and a Gentleman has aged quite gracefully. There are a lot of wonderful scenes with many authentic scenes that just can't be beat. Who could forget when Zach confesses to Sgt. Foley I got nowhere else to go, plus the final scene where Mayo is now an ensign finds Paula and walks out with her to the applause of his colleagues. The pacing was also very well structured. Even though the film was almost at the two hour mark, there was never a boring moment and that was because the romantic scenes never interfered with the OCS scenes and it flowed in a more natural way. We also deeply care about the characters and we hope that Zach and Paula stay a couple and hope they live a happy life after the credits roll. Overall this movie gets a 9/10 that's highly recommended, even if you're a late bloomer like me, it's better late than never if you haven't seen this movie. It still holds up today since its release back in 1982.

Its not my favorite because its the best movie of all time, or the most entertaining, etc., but because I feel this movie speaks to me personally, in its themes and in the character Zack Mayo played by R. Gere.   I knew of it many years before I actually saw it.  I was in late high school when it came out and its R rating kept me from seeing it for many years.  ***spoiler...All I knew of it was that Zack got Karate kicked in the balls by his opponent the drill instructor as told to me by a close friend in College Karate/P.E. Class.  Years later when I finally saw it, so many themes spoke to me. It's setting in the Northwest is one of the most compelling, myself being captivated by my first visit to the Northwest late in my College years after my Mother moved to the area--I immediately upon arriving for a visit, fell in love with the area which captivated me from the very moment as a magical place that innately held for me healing, soothing and fostered personal development.  I moved there immediately after graduating college and stayed 6 years until I was forced to leave for economic reasons.  That period of my life held many advances and life developments, many of which I find parallels with challenges and developments faced by Gere's character.   I like him came from a Navy family, and Spoilers Ahead...a family life which was less than ideal, which was tarnished by separation, and isolation from which I emerged a loner.  I too gained a college degree and had hopes for the future of accomplishments, and love, themes Gere's character finds in the movie.  I felt great involvement and relation to Gere's character when from his isolation/lonerism he makes a solid, truly close friend in training--something that I also lacked until later in life--but longed for and desired greatly.  His development of the relationship with Paula, played by Debra Winger also speaks to me as I relate it to a similar key and primary relationship of mine, my first after college graduation out in the real world  which was with a very wonderful woman I met shortly after my move to Seattle.  That relationship for me was serendipitous and like Zack, it was through this relationship that I began to truly open up to someone else, and other factors related to coming of age (the developing of maturity and truly becoming an adult), and experienced many matters including emotional, sexual,  social  relating to intimacy. The romantic themes of this movie feed many of my own deep personal desires and fantasies to act out many ideals of romanticism including the knight in shining armor saving the princess from XYZ factor or entity (in Winger's case the drudgery of her job/life and lack of prospect/opportunity into a Cinderella-like advancement played out in the last scene of the movie). Other concepts that speak to me are Zack's regression into himself when he experiences the great emotional pain of separation (when his close friend commits suicide and without saying goodbye...You dumb 'Okie', I was your friend;  Why didn't you come talk to me about it!?) whereupon Zack emotionally withdraws into himself and his old loner ways (how he self-protected emotionally in the abandoned way he was brought up in his childhood) even from his self-expansion love/intimacy partner Paula treating her badly and like an outsider or mere stranger or casual aquaintence when in reality, besides himself, she is the only other friend he truly has or shares anything significant with but he has not other way to cope/deal with the pain of separation and the loss of his close friend.  Another chord-striking parallel theme is Foley's taunting Zack about Zack's main character flaw, during Punishment training doing hoards of exhausting push ups with his face down in the mud You Can't because you know deep down inside that all these little boys and girls are better than you, attacking Zacks lonerism, which is an expression of his inner self-doubt and insecurity from the misfortunte broken family circumstances in which he was raised, and which made him feel inferior and different.  Zack and Foley finally realize the Great and Key turning point and transition that this Navy Officer training actually is for Zack when under the most emotionally charged cracking moment of his life, Zack finally admits from the innermost insecurity and loneliness of his heart that he has nowhere else to go--I got nothing else bringing him to emotional breakdown and tears. And from that moment on  he leaves behind the loner-insecure Zack Mayo, and emerges from his crysalis as the wet-winged new Zack Mayo, the Mature, forward moving, Self-assured Adult.  He demonstrates this new Self when he exhibits behavior looking out for  his buddies needs, rather than just thinking of his own, giving them boots, buckles (his personal wealth) where he had sought previously only to milk them of wheeler/dealer opportunity for a quick buck, but more so when he demonstrates great personal sacrifice, even personal loss by giving up his chance for personal fulfillment by grabbing the all time record on the base obstacle course in order to assist a fellow underling and only female classmate to achieve a once only, but required to be able to pass completion of the course's rope climb wall--something she could never do, assuring her ability to graduation, and Zack's transition from loner into the greatest manner of mature teamwork player- in which he NOW can find personal fulfillment.    When I was college age, a newly young adult, I had three main desires in my heart  A college degree (the symbol of self-development/education), a wife (the symbol of love, romance, intimacy and family), and a good job (the epitimy of a man's need to provide and be involved in his life's work.  That may also be why the final scene is so captivating for me, since when he carries off his love in his Ice Cream Suit Uniform/ (shining armor), they are heading off to a new life in which Zack is Guaranteed a Good Job as an Aviator Officer in the US Military where he will be captively always able to provide for his fam ily Housing, food, and income as an insider never being out of work or yearning to be able to find work to support them as I and many men have had to face in our insecurities and lack of opportunity at times.  It is these many themes of development from boyish insecurity with broken family misfortune in childhood, to Adult self-assured Maturity, experiencing serindipitous new personal intimacy, and friendship for the first times in his life, and arriving at the romantic level of knight in shining armor to carry away his own Cinderella, all set in the northwest and under the back drop of my idealization of the US Navy, for which I hold this film in the dear title as my favorite of all time movie.

Mayo and his fellow trainees are Officer Candidates at the US Navy Air Officer Candidate School, or AOCS.  They are college graduates who have entered the AOCS program to become pilots.  It is stated clearly, in the beginning, that Mayo has his degree, having just graduated.  One does not have to be an aeronautical engineer to become a pilot.  It is never stated what Mayo's degree was in, but it doesn't seem to be engineering.  Flight training is not restricted to engineers.  Mayo could have easily met the recruitment standards, especially if the program was under-manned.  This film was made during the Reagan years, when the Navy was undergoing a major expansion.  The OCS and NROTC programs grew greatly during this period.  And to those who compare Gossett to R. Lee Ermey, Gossett is more like the DI's that I came across in my Midshipman training.

He decides to join the Navy because he wants to fly jets, perhaps an allusion to his lack of initimacy with anyone. During training he meets Paula (Debra Winger), a local girl, whose father, a former officer candidate, she never knew. The two develop a relationship which at first seems to be just another one of those typical and casual types between a trainee and a local girl - based on enjoying the moments while they last, and then it will be over when Zach graduates and gets his assignment in Pensacola. But Paula, who genuinely likes Zach, hopes it won't end this way. But with her mother's guidance, who's been through what she's going through, she is advised not to say or do anything to trap Zach into a permanent relationship. Paula has the strength and discipline to follow her mother's advice and allow Zach to move on, if that is what was meant to happen. Zach also shows strength, determination and discipline to overcome the obstacles put forth by his drill instructor (L. Gosset Jr.) and makes it through the 13 week program.

However, at his graduation ceremony, he feels he has earned his success but then notices one value still missing within when he realizes none of his family attended the graduation. So he decides to go and pick up Paula from work and take her with him into his new career. The ending is one of the best moments in cinematic history, as we see Zach walk proudly through the factory to surprise Paula and take her away from it all.

Before I heard about this film, I never thought Hackford would have directed a romantic Richard Gere movie like this one. Richard Gere is one of my top favorite romantic film actors. Gere is almost my father's age; however, I don't know any other handsome, forward actors who are exactly my father's age. So I would count on Richard Gere. My father is one year younger than him, but that's all right. Why I am saying this is because whenever I am in love with someone, I would picture my own father when he was all young and doing romantic gestures like Richard Gere.Now, about the film, rather than mentioning the real life situation (compared to this film), the ending was so good, when Richard Gere enters a factory to see his girlfriend, along with the music theme that was playing. I realized that they spoofed that scene in one of the Simpsons series episodes. That was the first time I have seen Richard Gere so young. I would recommend this classic to my friends, especially to my close friend who has never seen it before. An Officer and a Gentleman made my life live on and on and made me want to feel lots of love by my special friends, especially girlfriends. Give two thumbs up for Taylor Hackford.

It had a nostalgic feel to it that gave it a yesteryear feel. This film was very moving and touching and brought a salt of the earth sort of tone to it that you mostly see in edgy movies from today. For example the very beginning was extremely edgy but done very tastefully, when Zach kept flash backing to his father not wanting to have much to do with him. Then in the present he had just spent the night in a supposed 3-way with a hooker and his Father Byron. The banter between him and his father with Byron's suggestive moves were just vague and ambiguous enough to be thought of nothing more than a man acting like a man (playing with his hand tucked into his underwear). The Graduation-Present lay sleeping as the father reaches for his son Zach who is leaving. A slight suggestive brush of his father's hand on his arm as he reaches for him not to leave. Not saying that any actual sexual contact was made between Zach and Byron other than the hooker between them, but it was there none the less. It gave it a haunting, touching, and emotionally charged feel. The longing Zach had for his fathers approval and to be close. Only to receive it in physical form via a female hooker, and possible incest that was only savagely and tastefully hinted or slightly suggested at. This didn't seem to scare the audience back then, but rather allow the radiance to use cognitive dissonance to grapple with the scene. The reason I share this view in such detail as I feel it sets a major tone for the film. It shows that Zach is trying to find something deeper than lust for a hooker (unlike his father). And at the same time trying to grow up without the nurturing his father didn't give him. He took what he could from what little attention his Dad gave him. To tear apart from that was like Velcro. To rip and tear away from the pull of one's own selfish motives and seek out something deeper. When he covered the eagle with the patch was a signal of his restraint. That he didn't want to be too free. But rather more focused on his own life and goals. I have more to say on this but I've written a lot already. This movie had so many different aspects (both hidden and obvious) to talk about that I couldn't point them all out in just one review. It was a great dynamic movie. And at times even underrated. But it did get plenty of accolades right from the start. Great love story between a man and a woman, great coming of age movie, great drama, very good writing, and had a awesome soundtrack.

Not really my kind of movie for the most part, but it held my interest when they were doing the training. Do not get me wrong, training takes up a huge portion of this film, but at its heart it is still more of a romance in my eyes. The story basically focuses on these two guys trying to get through this very hard training course so that they may become officers in the military. Their sergeant is going to try and make them quit, as that is his job to weed out those that are really not up to the task. That is one of the reasons I take issue with the movie, I thought the sergeant did nothing wrong in talking David Keith's character out of the program. That is what he was supposed to do, Gere's character's anger is rather misplaced as I would have blamed the female as she was clearly nothing more than an opportunist who cared nothing for the man himself and only felt bad after he did what he did near the end. In the end it is a bit of a messed up romance movie as the love these girls show for these men is simply more of a need to get out of the small town they lived in and make something better for themselves so a kind of self serving love to be sure. Still, some of the training stuff was enjoyable to watch.

His mom committed suicide when he was just a small boy and his father was never there for him. To escape the problems of his past and turn his life around, he joins the navy officer program so he can fly jets. His father does not believe Zack has what it takes to be an officer and laughs at his son when he tells him he wants to join the navy. Zack goes off to the base at Fort Warden near Port Townsend, Wa. for his 12 week boot camp. He soon forms a bond with another candidate named Sid (David Keith). While off duty Zack and Sid meet two local factory workers named Paula(Debra Winger) and Lynette (Lisa Blount). Zack takes to Paula while Sid takes to Lynette.We are taken through a joyride of emotions as we watch the characters progress through this film both in their relationships and in struggles through basic training under the strong command of Sargent Foley in a very grand performance by Lou Gossett Jr. Mayo is very unfocused and arrogant at the beginning of his training but Sgt Foley changes this. Because of his ways, the Sargent puts Zack through hell you might say but he builds character out of Zack in the process. This is probably the best ever performance by Richard Gere. Debra Winger and David Keith also were great in their roles. Something happens to Sid toward the end of the film that is very sad. Lets just say his girlfriend,Lynette, ruined him. This is a film that could have played out like a t.v. mellow drama but the fine direction and strong performances from the cast made it much better. This movie will bring tears to the eyes in some parts and make you laugh in others. I thought the performance by Lou Gossett was phenomenal, my very favourite ever by him. My only real complaint about this film was the character of Zack's father. I think his character was way underdeveloped. It would have been nice to have seen some kind of reconciliation between Zack and his father. They should have showed him at Zack's graduation.

This is a gross inaccuracy! The individual which Richard Geer depicts is an individual who apparently has a college degree (B.S or B.A) and applied for and was accepted to the United States Navy Officer Candidate School (OCS) in the state of Washington. A far cry away from the Naval Academy at Annapolis, MD. Nevertheless, the truth is that for approximately 14 weeks, the officer candidate gets paid the equivalent of an enlisted E-5 pay while attending the school, and must endure the rigors (torture, if you will) of those who are in-charge of training them - USMC Drill Instructors. It's an officer basic training, but no where near the four grueling years that Midshipmen at the Naval Academy must endure. When the candidate has passed all classes and physical conditioning evaluations, they graduate and are commissioned as reserve officers in the United States Navy (Ensign) or United States Marine Corps (Second Lieutenant). Many of them have already applied to be Navy or Marine Corps aviators and have taken mini-courses on how to survive in high altitude without oxygen or in the event of a crash at sea. After they're commissioned, the first enlisted person to render them a military salute will get a silver dollar. They must then report to basic undergraduate pilot school - which is usually held at Naval Air Station (NAS) Pennsecola (Florida). This will also include those newly commissioned officers who recently graduated from the US Naval Academy, Annapolis. In the olden days, as mentioned in the movie, if an officer candidate DOR'd or failed any portion of the training, they would have to serve as a Swabbie (i.e., enlisted sailor) for a period of four years, usually starting out at the E-3 rank. A severe cut in pay. That alone would make someone go for the brass ring. Just my 2-cents worth.

A traditional, simplistic outlook on life is everywhere. A never-quite-believable Gere is the square peg whose entire existence is saved through tough military training and conformity resulting therefrom. Winger plays a sexy, intelligent yet poor woman. Is she seeking a career? Education? Self realization? Not in that decade, Bonzo! Her only ambition is to nab a Navy officer and go AWOL from her factory job to bake cookies. Her entire life is defined by the attention of a man. <SPOILER>At movie's end, she can't even walk out of her job under her own power!</SPOILER>All this morality is fed us via a baby spoon, by means of slick packaging and the occasional very un-family values-like sex scene. To complicate matters, the romantic dialogue suggests a chronic stutterer who has listened to too much adult-contemporary radio (another 80s phenomenon), the military scenes are those we have seen before, and the direction is competent but unimaginative. Character-wise, we have every stereotype in the book here the bad girl who gets hers; the tough-but-fair DI who wants the best of the best of the best SIR; the weak willed best friend; and of course our heroes who reap the benefits of losing themselves to fit society's idea of normal. Sure makes me want to go to boot camp!The jingoism and conservatism of AOAAG might have been somewhat forgivable had it been a period piece; but then you would have a war film. As it is, if you want to see a really good movie about love and personal change in the 80s, this isn't it. See Children of a Lesser God, The Big Chill, or even Roxanne instead.

This here not only ranks as one of the best films of the decade but I think a strong argument could be made that it's right up there with CASABLANCA as one of the greatest love stories ever told. The film is flawless from the acting to the directing to the characters and the story. I really don't think I could find a single negative thing to say about this film and what's so shocking is that a mainstream movie could be so brutally honest on so many levels. This film has quite a bit going for it and all of it works perfectly. This includes the fun scenes early on during the basic training all the way up to the darker elements of the picture. I really can't recall too many movies that have such rich characters as this one. This isn't just true of the lead characters but even the smallest ones also have an impact on the story. The real showcase is of course the love story between Gere and Winger and I think it works perfectly well and is very much believable without coming across as fake or forced. The second love story is the one between Gere and Keith, which is something that doesn't get enough credit in the picture. Of course, there's also the Gossett character and his relationship with Gere. The film is certainly all about relationships and how humans deal with one another and their emotions.The performances are certainly some of the best you're going to see. Gere never gets the credit he deserves, which is a real shame but this here is perhaps his greatest performance. Just the way he goes through the various stages of this character is pretty special to watch and he perfectly nails all of it. Winger is also extremely good in her part and I thought she brought a certain maturity to these sometimes wild, young and naive characters. Keith is the one who never gets enough credit for his part but we've also got Robert Loggia, Lisa Blount, David Caruso, Grace Zabriskie, Tony Plana and Harold Sylvester doing great work. Gossett certainly deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar as he turns in one of the more memorable roles of any military officer.Director Taylor Hackford really keeps the film moving at a wonderful pace but he smartly mixes in some laughs with all of the heavy drama. There are some pretty dramatic and dark moments scattered throughout the film but there are also several moments that are quite funny. The film ended up winning two Oscars but I think it could have won a lot more because it really is the type of film that you can watch over and over and never grow tired of it or have its power fade.

He's had multiple good performances (in Pretty woman and Internal affairs), but he's never done anything better than this.  Louis Gossett Jr. and Debra Winger are good as well, but David Keith is not always convincing in my opinion.The story is almost never uninteresting as director Taylor Hackford guides us beautifully through the whole two hour-lasting process by adding some original twists now and then.  Although good camera positions are out of the ordinary, Hackford keeps a precise mix between the events IN and OUTSIDE the navy.  Those are two different lives, but both are lived by the same person.  While (outside the navy) Richard Gere is going out with his girlfriend and has to stand up for himself because, being a marine, he isn't always welcome everywhere, (inside the navy) he undergoes the drills and discipline of his superior and the numerous of challenging tests in order to become a good marine.What I liked most about this film was how everyone (who wanted to join the navy) disliked Louis Gossett Jr. at first for being very strict, but when they eventually HAD become a marine they were very thankful for his efforts, because they realized that without him (and his severity) they'd never got this far.And of course, Joe Cocker's great ballad 'Up where we belong' is worth mentioning.  You can hear the theme throughout the entire film, but the actual version with Cocker singing comes at the end when Gere carries Winger in his arms.All in all, this is definitely one of the better romantic films made in the last 20 years!

I first saw it when I was 14 years old. It was the middle of the night, I couldn't sleep and of the 4 TV channels to choose from back then, It looked like the movie just starting on one of them was the best of a bad bunch. I watched paying little attention, then something happened in the plot that made me take a little bit more attention. Then another, and then another until I was gripped by this brilliant movie till the end credits.Richard Gere plays Zack Mayo, a loner from a broken home, who's mother committed suicide and whose father is an alcoholic, whore chasing sailor. He's grown up with no discipline and little parental affection. After realising that his life is on the same downward spiral as his fathers, and wanting to better himself, (and fly Jets) he enrols in the Navy's Officer Candidate School in Washington State.On Base, he comes under the hawk like eyes of his new D.I, Gunnery Sergeant Foley, (Louis Gossett Jr) A tough marine, who's seen it all, done it all and can anticipate every move his new class will make. He befriends some but not all of his classmates and manages to find time for romance on his leaves with local girl Paula, (Debra Winger), despite Foley's warnings of local girls who will try to get themselves pregnant in order to marry a Naval Aviator.Zack's naval career gets off to a rocky start as he immediately sets up a lucrative side business selling shiny buckles and boots to his fellow candidates. When Foley discovers this, his weekend leave is replaced with extensive punishment drill. During which time Foley tries to encourage Zack to quit saying that he's too selfish to be an officer. Zack has no intention of quitting because he's 'GOT NOWHERE ELSE TO GO!!!!'.Zack's lesson has been learnt and he realises that to be a successful officer you need to care just as much for the people around you rather than just look out for yourself and sadly, it takes the most tragic of circumstances for Zack to put this into practice.AOAAG is a brilliant movie with Gere & Winger an inspired choice of casting as they both fill their scenes with a sensual/sexual delivery that makes the scenes they share totally believable without being either sickly sweet or unnecessarily smutty.

Fine picture and fine sound.Richard Gere is Zack Mayo. His mother died when he was Young, and as a boy of about 11 or 12 looked up his father, a Navy man, who was stationed in the Phillipines. Dad wasn't much of a role model, a drunkard who tried to have sex with as many women as he could. Zack learned lots in that situation, a bit of martial arts and a sense of taking care of himself. Plus a desire to make something better of himself.As a young adult and college graduate (Gere was around 30 here) living near Seattle, he decided that he wanted to go to OCS for a commission in the Navy, to fly jets. There he meets factory worker Debra Winger (around 25 here) as Paula Pokrifki, herself a child of a fling her mother had had with a young man in OSC. Mom told her to be wary of Navy men, the drill sergeant told the candidates to be wary of local women wanting to get pregnant and snag them.David Keith as Sid Worley becomes Zack's close friend. Sid had an older brother, a pilot, who was killed in action, and he felt an obligation to follow in his footsteps.Louis Gossett Jr. was the tough as nails Gunnery Sergeant Emil Foley, charged with either shaping these young men and women into Naval officers, or disqualifying them.For Zack, a critical step was for him to quit caring for only his own success and becoming a team player. In spite of his intentions to not fall in love, and move on after his training, he and Paula found it hard to resist each other.A fine movie which tackles some tough relationship issues.

All ending in love and romance.","Date":"27 May 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" What can I say about 1982's Officer and a Gentleman clearly one of the better movies of the 80's and in my opinion the best film of 1982. This movie can show a viewer so many sides and emotional elements like romance, friendship, and growth. Set in Seattle, Washington at the naval training school at Port Townsend enter Zack Mayo(Richard Gere) who's a life long loner and loser finally decides he has dreams of becoming a pilot. Zack wants to escape years of abuse, neglect, and lonely times, but first he must endure 13 weeks weeks of tough and torturous training. Zack will learn plenty along the way, most of all he learns character, discipline, and heart from a brilliant and iron fisted drill instructor by the name of Sgt. Foley(Louis Gossett Jr.) and in my opinion Gossett gives one of the finest supporting roles performance in film history as evidenced by his Oscar win for best supporting actor. Friendships and love are developed along the way when Zack falls in love with local girl Paula(Debra Winger) who's found her knight to take her away. And David Keith gives a very memorable performance as Zack's best friend and fellow candidate. It' so sad when the Keith character lets current social issues and past insecurities send him to a tragic end, believe me you will want to shed tears. Overall the performances are great from Gere, Winger, Keith, and most of all Gossett Jr. who carries the film with his noteworthy performance. This film is rich and very satisfying and really timeless because of it's elements of growth, and a fairy tale ending of love, and it proves an underdog can accomplish anything just by learning the important trait of discipline. A real winner and ranks as the top picture of 1982.

I suppose I must have liked it much better then than I did this time. With most of the users' comments raging it was the best they'd ever seen, I really expected to be wowed. I hate to say it, but I wasn't. I tried to listen to the part of the DVD where the director (Taylor Hackford) was doing his spiel, but I couldn't get into it - I really didn't care, because he wasn't telling too much how difficult the scenes were to film or adding interesting comments, just his total relief that the film ever got to the screen - even the producer wanted to take his name off it.Of course, An Officer and a Gentlemen is a a hit again, because it is now being seen by a younger crowd - pretty-much the first time they've seen this type of movie. I respect their opinions, but my opinion is this is not a romantic movie for really mature people. As an older film, people who are watching it for the first time, it is a different Richerd Gere (Mayo) they are seeing. Some even mention Primal Fear, which - to me - IS really a movie for all ages, but terribly frightening, in that it shows how adults can become obsessed with younger, beautiful people. I thought the sex scenes scorched the screen - very true-to-life. Not too many people would want that side of the personality made public.Debra Winger (Paula) WAS beautiful and played her role skillfully. I also got caught-up with the touching ending, the music certainly making it right. I was onto Lisa Blount (Lynette) from git-go - she advertised it. David Keith was such a fresh face in this film, and his character certainly was the all-American guy (wonder if they make them like that any more?), intelligent enough to realize he wasn't into military life. He became like Mayo as a child - betrayed without the macho strength to make it without his love. I thought Douglas Stewart got all the aspects of the 13 weeks in his script, but I think it was just a tad too clean and attractive. Richard Gere was right for the role - Travolta ??? Yeah, Louis Gossett Jr did a good job in the film, and I do not begrudge him his Oscar. What DID become of him? Almost all of the other cast-members went on to future movies, Gere certainly proving he wasn't just a handsome man. All of the male cast were so healthy and virile, what else could they do but succeed? I'm glad younger people have a movie they can relate to, BUT There wasn't enough intrigue in this film to really make it a classic love-story. Enjoyable, indeed. However, enduring love is seen in movies like Sophie's Choice in which everyone had so much baggage; even Stingo was so virgin, he was just as bad as the stinkers. I can watch An Officer and a Gentleman again, but it would be for a change of pace, or to make certain I was paying attention, this time. BTW, I missed the sex-scene when tears were supposed to be rolling down Winger's face because she hated Gere - she always looked like she was having a good time, to me.I think if they hadn't had the problem with the military officials hating this script and refusing to cooperate in any way and it had been made in Pensacola (Fla.), it would have been much grittier - Pensacola has always been a swinging town.For light entertainment, I recommend this film to all - if you're looking for a truly steamy love-story, this ain't it.

Although it follows the basic outline of a stock romance flick, this film deviates from the magical, rosy, sunny world in which most love films take place into the grim and dark realm of reality. That is not to say that An Officer and a Gentleman is depressing, but you do have to be in the right mood to watch and enjoy it.Richard Gere plays Zack Mayo, a young man who joins a Navy flight school to escape the world of his father, an alcoholic and a womanizer. His mother committed suicide when he was a boy and he was then taken into the custody of his father, a military man himself, stationed in south-east Asia. While his father was out chasing prostitutes, young Zack was left to fend for himself in the rough, foreign streets. He grows to hate his father and fears that some day he may end up his like his father himself. So, once he's old enough, he joins the Navy to learn to fly jets, and to give his life some direction away from that of his father.His journey is both hindered and helped by gunnery sergeant Foley, played by Louis Gossett Jr. (who won an academy award for his powerful performance) who puts him and his comrades through hell to expose any potential weaknesses.And, of course, Zack meets a girl, but it isn't love at first sight as much as lust at first glance. Zack meets Paula, who isn't from a perfect family either, at a dance and hooks up with her for what was originally intended to be a one-night-stand relationship. But that mentality soon goes out the window as they are slowly and discretely drawn together. Excellent performances by both Richard Gere and Debra Winger make their relationship seem all the more believable.Taylor Hackford has done an excellent job directing this film, giving it the feel of a classic romance with a few twists. The cinematography is textbook, making the film easy to follow but not overly simple. The ending scene, with the title theme playing and a big freeze frame finale, is of such emotional power that has not been seen since Rocky. It is also said that it was Hackford who forced such emotion from Gere and Winger.An Officer and a Gentleman is all about relationships. Not just male-female relationships like that of Zack and Paula, but also the equally powerful relationships of Zack and his father or Sgt. Foley. Zack is not a perfect person, in fact, at times he can be a total jerk, which adds to the realism of the story. Taylor Hackford has used Gere, Winger and Gossett to create a classic tale of love, hate, life and death.

As we don't pay our duty in military in my family in the last 3 generations (myself, I was exempted because of my hearing), it's interesting to see the barrack life. I would like to take the drill once to see if I can do it.Beyond this, as the movie was shot in locations in the Pacific Northwest, it has the feel of Twin Peaks a decade before. I recognize that the cast is good and I realize that Debra (along with Darryl) was the actress of the 80's. Gere looks like an eternal candidate for the French Presidency while Debra's friend looks like Miss Cova, and all the buddies are future all-stars so it's funny to see their young faces.

However the reason the love in this movie doesn't feel real to me isn't because the acting is bad or because there's just no chemistry between the two main lovers, Richard Gere and Debra Winger, the issue is that this entire movie is just a gigantic pizza which is 80% cheesiness and 20% movie.The movie only ever manages to have one genuinely good part, the climax, when David Keith offs himself in a motel room with a belt in the shower, something truly sad and something that made me feel a connection to his character and disdain for his ex-lover who had pushed him off the edge. Shortly after however it seems like the movie just forgets this whole entire incident with little collateral damage beyond Gere mouthing off to the gunnery sergeant and having a grudge match that leads to (not even joking) Gere getting kicked in the balls and lying down in the fetal position after him and Gossett exchange a few pseudo karate kicks.Its a shame too, mostly because Gere's character could have been much more interesting, what with his background being raised by his alcoholic father in the Philippines and ports around the world, but the movie seems all to eager to move past that and just get to the part where he's a nice guy and marries the girl. Really he's only ever a jerk in the beginning and his jerkiness is only ever mildly apparent. yet they still try to make him seem like some disturbed rebel when the only edgy stuff he does is karate, riding motorcycles, not talking about feelings, and having a stash of boots and belt buckles he fenced off to his bunk mates, a kind of ridiculous plot point which leads to him and the sergeant having beef, but what was his purpose in doing it anyways? did he need money? did he just want to be edgy? did the screenwriter just want him to be edgy?The worst part is the end, if this were a cheese pizza the last slice would literally just be a melted piece of a cheese wheel, of course he commits to Winger and goes to her upon his graduation and lifts her up in the air joyously in love a mere 20 or so minutes after his closest friends suicide, and the credits roll leaving me, the audience, wondering where the last two hours of my life went with nothing to show for it but the memory of a crappy cheese pizza of a movie without a single pepperoni or topping in sight.smh 4/10 "},{"Title":"Works on just about every level","Date":"15 September 2009","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" This film works on just about every level.

Upon seeing it again, I am convinced that along with High Noon, Casablanca, and Twelve O'Clock High, it is one of the best movies ever made.

Compared to the screenplays I see today, the screenplay of this film screenplay now seems close to perfect in terms of how it tells a coherent story while at the same time being both uplifting, didactic, and entertaining all at the same time. So many films today are disjointed, badly edited, and wagged by the tail of special effects. Although I have never been much of a Ricahrd Gere fan, he was perfect for this particular role, as he was also in Chicago. I read in one of the reviews that Debra Winger was not happy with her performance in this film, but I can not imagine why. Like Chicago, this film comes as close to being perfect as a film can get. As for realism, the only comment my daughter had to say was that the high pressure chamber was a piece of cake, at least when she took it, and she never knew anyone to have any problem with it (although she said a lot of cadets had a problem with the tear gas and gas masks.)

Mr Gere and Mr Gossett(along with Mr Jack Webb the best D.I. on film, Mr F.Lee Ermey being ever - so - slightly a fictional creation of the anti - military Mr Stanley Kubrick and Mr Gustav Hasford)dominate the movie.Miss Deborah Winger seems rather unhappy as the factory - girl/Cinderella who finally gets her handsome prince.I found the obligatory sex scenes unconvincing and uncomfortable. Mr Gere however,displays the necessary energy,resentment and sheer grit to convince as the none too pleasant hero. Some may find the rather totalitarian assumption that the repression of individuality is somehow a good thing a little disturbing.But ultimately,Authority is seen as a rather benign paternalism which Mr Gere clearly accepts having rejected that of his own father.

He has to go through thirteen weeks of boot camp, headed by the tough drill instructor Emil Foley (Louis Gossett, Jr.).  Mayo ends up becoming best buddies with fellow recruit Sid Worley (David Keith), and starts a relationship with Paula Pokrifki (Debra Winger).MY TAKE  A lot of people claim that this is a great film.  It is not.  However, it does manage to stay engrossing throughout the whole two hour running time.  Louis Gossett, Jr. won an Oscar for his role as the drill sergeant, although I didn't think he was that great (although he still was good).  I think R. Lee Ermey was a better drill sergeant in 1987's Full Metal Jacket, and he wasn't even nominated for an Oscar.  Debra Winger was also nominated for an Oscar, and that was a well-deserved nomination.  She was one of the reasons why An Officer and a Gentleman managed to rise above its predictable roots.  Richard Gere and David Keith, while not great performances, were solid.  An Officer and a Gentleman is a predictable romance, but it does somehow manage to rise above mediocrity.

To show that a professional army is nothing else but a bunch of criminals and promotes them to an higher status.It is not new at all . At Waterloo, the movie, Wellington says Scum, they are all scum. Another version of the same statement, loosely translated from a French auteur confirms this  The scum of the earth, contracted for drinking.. It's a wonder that we made from it brave fighters.In Officer an Gentleman, the drinking rewards are substituted for sexual pleasures. As befits the times...There is a big difference between this war propaganda and Kubrick's objective outcome. Perhaps the character of the drill Sergeant was copied by Kubrick from this. Since SK is no longer amongst us I would rather be pleased to know that both reflect the true reality. Army training is designed to make a beast out of a man..This movies glorifies such process. Wellington used it, but did not approve. An English gentleman has to be an hypocrite, otherwise no gentleman..In the near future, new Empires will rise. My only hope is that they will only destroy the Western military apparatus and keep our civilization, that they seem, and indeed have, in the case of Japan, adopted.But do not rely on this for sure. The West has humiliated China for about a century (1860-1950). Expect vengeance...

The end is pure Hollywood garbage and Gere & Winger have no chemistry.  She has stated publicly that making this movie was one of the worse experiences in her life, and I don't doubt it for a minute. I liked parts of it, but it really did waste the talents of Gossett, Keith, Grace Zabriskie and David Caruso (in a small part).

Richard Gere manages to escape his rough-hewn, hard-partying father by enlisting in Navy flight school, but his drill sergeant appears to hate him on sight. Oscar-winner Louis Gossett Jr. plays the sneering, appalled gunnery sergeant with absolutely no let-up, and with no regard to all the impersonations of this same character from past history (he's yet another cliché, who naturally uses the old are you a man? line--only here it becomes steers and queers). Debra Winger has a threadbare role as a man-chaser who only wants to land an officer; she's around to make Gere swoon and contemplate his heart. The actual relationship in the movie, the one at the forefront of the action, lies in the masochistic one between the stubborn recruit and the sergeant who wants to break him. It's a stale throwback without much humor or heart, only sweat. *1/2 from **** "},{"Title":"Old fashioned romancer - but it somehow entertains!","Date":"20 March 2004","Score":"0 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  A rough-neck with a family history in the  military wants to be a navy officer and a gentleman. However some of the military brass stand in his way and will even stoop to dirty tricks.  They tell me that that John Denver turned this movie down! Well I tell you something I would pay double to see John Denver have a crew-cut and take on a black drill sergeant in hand-to-hand combat. Sounds just like his sort of thing - instead of getting angry he could write a right-on country song about it!There is nothing wrong with Richard Gere as an actor (when trying!) and there is nothing wrong with Debra Winger as an actress. Indeed Winger is actually a very good actress and it a shame that Hollywood prefers people that want to throw their sexuality at you. Sadly she is playing someone that works in a factory and therefore doesn't know - straight away -  that America doesn't have a base in Mos-cow!America doesn't recruit officers from the hard-of-thinking - they have to leaders of men. What we have in this group are followers and not leaders. Besides from his (Gere's) background he should know what was involved Breaking people down to build them back up again. It is all a game - and he should know that.Louis Gossett Jr. won an Oscar for shouting banalities and sticking his chest out a lot, which shows that such awards are handed out at random. Samuel L Jackson didn't win for Pulp Fiction, remember! Sorry to sound harsh LG Junior, but if you could really act they would give you real roles with grown up dialogue  - instead all you can do is B movie junk.  The one thing that tells me that this is certainly movie  - when Gere arrives at the factory to pick up his squeeze everyone burst in to applause as she is swept off her feet. If this was real life no one would bother to look up - no matter careless!

It was pretty cool. A fairly funny film with Richard Gere as Zack Mayo. A pretty hilarious guy. His girlfriend Paula, played by Debra Winger was a really great girl. I wasn't keen on Lynnette Pomeroy. She ditched Sid and it resulted in disaster. Lynnette was Paula's friend who was a bimbo!

The script appears to be something found behind a studio file cabinet, perhaps lost there since the 30s. The actors move thru the film, reciting their lines as though the first time they've seen them were on the cue cards. The mere fact, that an individual of Gere's character's repute could become an officer is distressing. Although even more distressing is the accolades that garner this turkey. The only redeeming feature here, if there is one, is the presence of David Keith.

To that extent, this film, perhaps the worst ever to win an Oscar, gives even to this day. Ever since the overplayed theme song (up where we belong) demolished the airwaves in the summer of 1982, I have always imagined this film as sappy, lousy, a total chick flick and with a terribly unrealistic portrayal of our military. As it turned out, even those low expectations were not met, as this film is far worse. In fact, if you were to set out to make a bad movie, with a bad cast, bad cinematography, and a bad theme song, you'd be hard-pressed to top this.No one factor makes this film bad, as you could remove any one item from the film and it would still stink. Zach Mayo (Richard Gere) isn't inspiring as a lead, nor is Gere, but Deborah Winger takes bad to a new level in this film as the extremely uninspiring, social-climbing girlfriend (who puts down a fellow social climber for doing the same thing). A few years ago Winger lamented on there not being roles for older female actresses, but perhaps those who were avoiding her merely saw her crapper of a performance in this film.As is this were bad enough, we wind up stuck with Lou Gossett Jr. as an academy award winner for his phoned-in performance as the stereotypical drill instructor, a movie with no real plot that is driven by poor characters, and total pandering to the female side of the audience that drives the box office.While not surprising that the movie was a hit, that doesn't improve its quality. Simpleminded moviegoers will love it, while those with an acquired taste for quality film will see right through it.A must-miss, but if you are curious, check out this film for its train-wreck appeal.

In two hours, he showed 13 weeks of military training, a developing romance and character building. As I said before, this can be done, but Hackford just scratched the surface with every plot. He just took too little time to really show the essence of each plot. Hackford skips entire weeks and that's what killed this movie. If he stuck with 1 story (the navy one would be the best if you ask me), he probably would have made a great movie. Trying to stuff the movie with plots is not the only mistake Hackford made. His choice of actors was another. Richard Gere wasn't really at his best here. He just overacted too obvious. The scene where Mayo said the famous line I've got nowhere else to go was clearly overacted. A couple of minutes before that, Mayo said I ain't gonna quit. My stomach twisted when he said that, it was simply too overacted. So, what've we got a bad story and a really bad male lead. OK, I can see you think Where does that one star come from? Well, there was one thing I did like about the film, which was the music. I simply love `Up where we belong'...

Basically Zachary 'Zack' Mayo (Golden Globe nominated Richard Gere) had a hard childhood and adolescence while growing up, with his mother committing suicide, and his father, who admittedly did not want the responsibility, becoming his official guardian, while also serving as a Naval seaman in the Philippines, so he grew up with no real guidance, a true home and adult responsibility. As a young man Zack has enlisted in the Navy himself in the hopes of becoming a jet fighting officer, the program starts at the air naval station on Whidbey Island, Washington with a thirteen week series of training regimes, he is hoping to take the easiest route as possible, even bending the rules and cutting corners. The drill instructor Sergeant Emil Foley (Oscar and Golden Globe winning Louis Gossett Jr.) is having none of it though, he appears to enjoy humiliating the recruits, especially Zack, trying to eliminate the weaker candidates and force them to DOR (drop on request), of course as time goes by they all try to go out of their way to prove their strengths. The recruits are all warned of the Puget Debs, these are the local girls who work in the near drab factory an escape this trying to lure and trap the candidates, ignoring this Zack meets Paula Pokrifki (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Debra Winger) and his best friend among the other candidates Sid Worley (Golden Globe nominated David Keith) meets Lynette Pomeroy (Lisa Blount). Zack does indeed prove himself to Sergeant Foley and completes the thirteen weeks without DORing, he even comes to admit to the commanding officer his reasons for wanting to be in the Navy, and meanwhile his relationship with Paula teaches him lessons of what it truly means to be grown up. There comes the lowest point when Sid commits suicide, following a rejected marriage and no real baby by Lynette, she just wanted to marry a Naval officer, Zack wants to DOR, but Foley will not let him as he is close to graduation, and the two men end up clashing in an unofficial martial arts fight, with Foley winning kicking him in the groin. In the end Zack turns up to the graduation and is sworn into the Navy by Foley, now officially an officer and in the white uniform he is to begin flight training, but before this he seeks out Paula in the factory she works, they kiss and he picks her up and walks out with her in his arms, with the workers including Lynette applauding, and as they walk out Laura takes Zack's hat off to wear on her own head. Also starring Robert Loggia as Byron Mayo, Lisa Eilbacher as Casey Seeger, Ugly Betty's Tony Plana as Emiliano Della Serra, Harold Sylvester as Perryman, David Caruso as Topper Daniels, Victor French as Joe Pokrifiki, Grace Zabriskie as Esther Pokrifiki, Tommy Petersen as Young Zack and Mara Scott Wood as Bunny. Gere, despite being a wooden actor, obviously became a big star and a sex symbol following this film, highly successful in it's time, and Gossett with his time on screen proves a worthy winner of the supporting actor Oscar, the girl loves man in uniform format certainly works, I admit I found the boot camp stuff more interesting, but the love story element has it's moments too, it is a likable romantic drama. It won the Oscar for Best Song for Up Where We Belong (also won the BAFTA and Golden Globe), and it was nominated for Best Film Editing, Best Music for Jack Nitzsche and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Score, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Richard Gere was number 76 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 43 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, the film was number 68 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers, it was number 23 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments, and it was number 29 on 100 Years, 100 Passions.
