[{"Title":"Strange mixture of ideas","Date":"9 July 2007","Score":"9 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Thriller","Review":" In the mid nineties, lots of those movies where made. They usually run direct-to-video with some contemporary stars. Mix in a cop-scenario, interesting girls, some action plus a small spoon of mystery/esoteric dust - and voil√† you have a flick good enough for the video stores shelf for a rainy Saturday night.I loved to see Patsy Kensit, and especially Denise Crosby. They tried best to be into the characters. Unfortunately, later you can see trough the plot somehow by the way the characters try to overact some of the less believable plot twists. That's more the problem of the script, which lefts lots questions open at the end.The director seemed not to know which way to spin the story, so it wiggles drunken between psychology, cop-story and a little x-files. I also think there is too much repetition of the always the same (light) nudity scenes to fill the movie length up. I was saddened by the way they handled the showdown - there was MUCH more into this.As a fan of movies in that time period, I can still give em a 5/10 on it, because they tried. But times have changed. I would only watch it on free TV if you are an fan of Patsy or Denise. "}]
