Rosco was always making life difficult for David. Then one day, a moon rock would be on display at school.It soon turns up missing. David sees Rosco with it and turns him in, the same day David and his family would be moving away...To a place of new beginnings...Oakland.            Thirty years later David (Rick Moranis) has grown up to be a writer. His son, Ben, is a bully. One day, David get's a letter from the school he went to as a lad, it asked him to come back and teach a class, so they head for Hastings, Minnesota. They get to their house and meet their new overly nice neighbors.           David finds that nothing's changed, except the librarian informs him that Green Eggs and Ham is overdue! Several thousand days overdue! David also meets the shop teacher, Ross. He and David become friends, until David notices the one chipped tooth Ross had that looked like a fang. It was him! Roscoe Bigger! Also, Ross's son, Kirby, is bullied by Ben. What an odd turn of events. Ben also thinks his dad's a loser.            Ross soon learns that David is the boy he used to pick on and begins pulling mean spirited pranks on him. He does lot's of them, in fact. But before then, Ross was a very passive person. He just didn't do anything when people were horsing around in his class or when his kids at home were messing around. But now that he's rediscovered his roots, he really put's his kids in line and get's a mean student of his to behave by having him come face to face with a grinder.         A nervous-wreck teacher and a woman David likes, Victoria, think David's nuts, so he tries to call a truce with Ross. But it was then that Ross found out it was David who turned him in for snatching the moon rock. Now Ross has murderous anger and goes after David, while yelling about what he's been through. But when they're both out on a log over a roaring river in the middle of a rain storm, David stands up to Rosco and inadvertantly knocks him off and into the falls. David tries to turn himself in, but the police station was closed. Probably gone out to get donuts or something. Anyway, David heads home and is confronted with Ross again. Now their sons, Ben and Kirby had become friends. So David and Ross talk it out. Ross had stolen the moon rock because he wanted to be an astronaut.        Next day, it was time for the Leary's to move on. They were going to New York City. But they weren't going alone. The Biggers were right behind them. They had a mobile home, which was good because it's mobile.        This is a good movie. Rick Moranis and Tom Arnold are good together. Everyone else is good in this movie. Jeffrey Tambor's in it, but Curtis Armstrong, I hate that guy. I think he's a pain in the ass. He's just annoying!! His role in this film wasn't funny. Nor was he good in Jingle All The Way!

It's just that the film is watchable at 2am when you need to be bored to sleep by a sappy American movie. That's all I can say about it.The plot is so transparent and formulaic that a five-year-old could have told you the ending, and has more holes than fine lace. The acting is notably bad on all counts. When the established leads get upstaged by an unknown 10 year-old you have to worry. Rick Moranis plays his usual weedy character and Tom Arnold plays his childhood bully. Not challenging parts and this shows; they aren't even trying.I, like many others, was bullied at school and found the story interesting in that it showed both sides but the cheezy(TM) subplot involving their children was forced and let down the one saving grace.All in all, I give this film 2/5.

When that attempt gropes toward the inner pain of dark comedy, the film may have merit. Yet when the focus is on cheap non laughs surrounded by a total disregard for substance, logic, and human decency, the result is most often a bloated, turgid mess like BIG BULLY.Director Steven Miner wastes the limited talents of all concerned. Rick Moranis is a weedy, nerdy little man who has to relive the trauma of childhood bullying by beefy Tom Arnold. As the film opens, both Moranis and Arnold are in the fourth grade. Arnold plays a blubbery bully that one sometimes sees in a filmed version of a Steven King horror movie. But in the hands of a King based script, the bully is a source of unredeemed evil. Here, under Miner's unsure grasp, Arnold is no more than a walking tub of prepubescent lard who seeks to bully the nerdy Moranis. Now if Miner had tried to make a serious movie about childhood bullying, then BIG BULLY might have had something worthwhile to say about the angst of childhood insecurities.Now flash forward twenty years. Moranis and Arnold are both teachers in the same grammar school, and Arnold quickly reverts to the bully that he was. What makes this regression reprehensible is Arnold's justification that as a victim, Moranis thoroughly deserved his fate. What then follows is a ridiculous chase scene between prey and predator that offers no lasting insight into either demented personality. Julianne Phillips is a wasted toss in as Moranis' girlfriend. At the end, when director Miner seeks closure, the film ends in the uneasiest of endings, one that satisfied neither the desire for revenge nor one that offers justification for that revenge in the first place.

He returns home as a local celebrity to join the teaching staff, but once again encounters his old childhood nemesis who's bent on repeating the same torment despite their advanced ages. Not as bad as it sounds, with two likable, enthusiastic leads who provide some occasional laughs, but the film's dedication to juvenile slapstick grows tiresome after a while.

He was the meek nerd doing his best young Woody Allen impersonation in Little Shop of Horrors (1986), and he was absolutely perfect as Barney in My Blue Heaven, which was--at the time--his fourth pairing with Steve Martin. (They ended up making four films together.)Tom Arnold has never been particularly funny. He showed some signs of talent in True Lies (1994), but everything after that just went downhill. Here's a guy who has appeared in some of the worst films and television shows of the last decade, including McHale's Navy (1997) and The Stupids. In fact, I went to the theater to see McHale's Navy upon its release and felt like vomiting from the first five minutes into it. Big Bully is Rick Moranis' worst film and one of Tom Arnold's best, if that's saying anything.I'll admit that the beginning of Big Bully was quite funny. There are many laugh-out-loud segments. But, unfortunately, they are drowned out by an over-the-top and truly awful, ridiculous ending, in which a man's old bully from school goes after him again with weapons from a wood-carving class. (Be careful, your kids may never want to go back to school again.)Rick Moranis is the man who is attacked. His name is David, and the film opens with a younger version of himself being chased down a street and up against a metal gate by a chubby fellow his own age. We assume that he is beaten to a pulp, but before we see anything, it all fades away.Years later, David has a son of his own, and has since moved out into the big city. But he's tired of the city life, and after his wife leaves him, David decides to move back to his home town, along with his son. They arrive, he finds out he has hundreds of dollars due on a Dr. Seuss book he got out from the library years ago (funny segment there), and he moves into his new home. David soon teaches school, where he finds out that an old bully of his, Fang (Tom Arnold), is teaching carving.David gets scared, runs away from Big Bully (who seems to be nice now, and truly wants a friendship with the man) throughout the film, until, in a scary moment, he realizes Fang really is still a psycho, and the two men battle it out in the school, in ridiculous, childish gags and moments.Alas, that's all the film is comprised of, with scattered--and very predictable--ideas involving romantic interests and such cliches. It's too bad--this was a decent premise to begin with.Big Bully literally massacred Rick Moranis' career, and since then he has appeared in only a few real films--unless you count straight-to-video animated and live-action Disney-esque films real movies.This is just hideous, a film to rival the bad qualities of McHale's Navy and The Stupids. The movie is tolerable in an annoying sort of way until the climactic finale, which is so out of control and awful that it really just makes you want to throw up.This is one bad movie. I can't imagine a worse result stemming from such a poor comedian mixed with such a great one. Rick Moranis should sue, and Tom Arnold should die. But that's just my opinion. I'm not going to be a bully about it, or anything.0.5/5 stars.- John Ulmer "},{"Title":"It's sad to see how this great cast has fallen","Date":"29 October 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Thriller","Review":"  Rick Moranis used to be a popular star but it was probably with this film that he suddenly wandered into where is he now status.
