The reason it doesn't descend to a level consistent with the screenplay's unoriginality is the superior acting by the three principal performers.Claire (Ashley Judd) and Tom (James Caviezel) are living an idyllic and romantic married life, trying hard to have a baby.  Everything is going swimmingly until one day Tom is arrested and charged with murder and war crimes dating back to his military service and raid in El Salvatore years earlier.  It seems Tom's entire identity is a lie and his name is really Ron Chapman, a former Special Forces commando.Claire, who is conveniently a prominent defense lawyer, takes up his case determined to prove he is innocent, choosing to believe his denials despite the fact that everything she knows about him is a fabrication.  She hires Charlie Grimes (Morgan Freeman) to assist her because until he became a broken down alcoholic, he was once one of the top lawyers in the military.The film is paced well and balanced between courtroom drama and other related storylines like constant death threats, a dirty general and a mystery man.  It is fairly standard fare, but the presentation is engaging.Morgan Freeman is such a terrific actor, that even a trite script can't keep him down.  He is wily and insolent as the washed up lawyer with a few tricks left up his sleeve.  Freeman projects an unassuming power in his work, full of dynamism yet highly amiable.  His interaction with Judd is wonderful, treating her with avuncular kindness and intellectual respect.Ashley Judd is a fine dramatic actor, who returns to serious drama after an ill advised detour into romantic comedy (`Someone Like You').  Judd is razor sharp in this film, coming across as bright, energetic and passionate.  She is tough as nails and doesn't back down to pompous military officers or thugs trying to intimidate her.Jim Caviezel rounds out the cast with a strong performance as the accused.  This is a tough character because he is so mysterious and duplicitous.  Caviezel delivered a strong portrayal of an enigmatic character in `Angel Eyes', so he had some experience with this type of role.  He handles the part well, appearing utterly sincere whether his character is telling the truth or not.Amanda Peet gives her standard performance as Claire's hair brained and sex obsessed sister.  Peet is no serious dramatic talent, but she has this character down and comes across as believably ditzy and concerned about her sister despite their obvious sibling rivalry.This film doesn't fool anyone with its surprise ending, but it does deliver good suspense, a tried and true formula and some excellent performances.  I rated it a 7/10.  It's worth a look for viewers who like mysteries.

The film is yes perhaps predictable and we've seen it all before but something about it is full of high energy and scares and thrills and it's the perfect night at the movies. Ashley Judd plays a high profile attorney who's life is turned upside down when her carpenter husband is arrested for murder years earlier while in the army. The twist is she didn't know he was ever in the army and everything from her husbands name to where he was during the murder is all new to her. Still she manages to trust him as best she can and offers to help the young, naive army attorney who has been assigned to her husbands case. To help them both with this heavy case that could bring the death penalty to her beloved husband they hire former Army Lawyer Charlie Grimes (played by Morgan Freeman.)Freeman is...well he's Morgan Freeman he doesn't really have to BE anything...but as usual he churns out a wonderful performance as the alcoholic lawyer who was discharged for dishonourable conduct. The case unfolds like a perfect mystery as the team of three along with Judd's sister played by Amanda Peet (who turns out can actually act...who knew) tries to find the truth behind the military cover up that ended up with the deaths of nine innocent civilians. All the pieces fit together and you're following the film on the edge of your seat and rooting for Judd's character. Everyone in this film plays a part and they play it just wonderfully. This movie is a real nail biter, with plenty of cheap scares and drama. Morgan Freeman, who during the course of the movie goes from recovered Alcoholic to re-newed Alcoholic is interesting enough to hold the whole movie but he doesn't have to.Unfortunately as with some good things...there is always a downside. The ending is a cheap, ridiculous thrill that is more of a let down than anything. After collecting all these facts that add up perfectly in everyone's mind including the audience, every single one of those facts are forgotten and tossed aside in order for a ridiculous supposed surprise ending which is not a shock or surprise or even a oh my ending. Such an enormous let down for such a fantastic film. Why they thought they had to end it like this is ridiculous. However...in saying that don't let that stop you from checking out this movie because it's well worth your ten bucks at the theatre, you won't be disappointed. I give this film a strong 8.5/10 but easily...without the ending could be taken as a 10/10 movie.

This movie is executed wonderfully. Yes, there are the usual thriller cliches, but once you get past all that, this movie is really entertaining. The acting is not all that bad either.

Ashley Judd is married to this guy who is arrested and charged with massacring innocent civilians in Central America as a special ops agent in the Marine Corps. She's a lawyer and decides to defend him herself but, knowing nothing of Courts Martial, she hired ex-drunk Morgan Freeman to help her. Some shady stuff follows, the charges are withdrawn, and hubby turns out to be guilty after all and tries to off her. That's about all I understood.I used to teach classes to Marines at New River Air Station and every other class or so, one of them would show up with a black eye. I finally mentioned this one night and a student asked, What does that tell you about the Marine Corps? The students told me a lot more about the Marine Corps than this movie does. According to the movie the Corps is made up of beefy ugly bruits with haircuts you wouldn't believe, blustering and pompous, but they melt away like Wusses before Ashley Judd's fierce determination.I really like Ashley Judd, by the way. She has a trim figure and a plump, pretty, asymmetrical and highly expressive face. Her left eyebrow is always cocked in disbelief. She has dark greenish irises that have a tendency to roll heavenward when she's exasperated. And she's a competent actress too when given the chance to act. I like Morgan Freeman too. His face is made of lumps, in profile his nose seems lopped off at the end, and in this film his hair is long and wooly and combed crazily backward, as befits a recovering alcoholic. And he's the soul of reliability. If I wanted a doctor or a lawyer I'd look him up in one big jiffy. He can even be a credible drunk. Amanda Peet is properly sluttish but not really necessary. Paul Caveziel as the husband looks the part of the tough Marine but doesn't carry his weight, or maybe it's partly that the role doesn't give him a chance.But -- well, then there's the plot. Forget about any sociopolitical comments on Special Ops in Central America. It's a murder mystery. All along we're led to believe along with Judd that the military is made up of a bunch of conniving morons and heavies. Dark cars and pickups follow Judd around. A gang of unidentified thugs jump out of nowhere and try to beat Freeman's brains out. (Between the two of them, Judd and Freeman spend half the movie with braces, black eyes, and bandages.) In the end, or so it seems, the bad guys aren't the bad guys after all, but the good guy is a bad guy, or else maybe the bad guys and the good guy were both bad guys, or -- well, you get the picture, even if I didn't. The climax is just another woman-who-discovers-her-trusted-partner-is-a-murdere-and-is-now-going-to-murder-her scene. He trusses her up and is about to kill her, although his expectations are unclear. What I mean is, hubby has just had charges of mass murder withdrawn. He hasn't been acquitted so he's still chargeable and under suspicion. And Morgan Freeman has just uncovered evidence that hubby is guilty. Freeman calls Judd and gives her the dope. Now hubby is about to shoot his wife in their own home because she knows he's a murderer, right? But meanwhile Freeman knows too. And there will be blood all over the place if he shoots his wife. What does he have to gain by killing her? Absolutely nothing. It's as if, at this point, the writers had thrown away the rest of the script and said, Let's stick in a woman-in-jeopardy climax. The audience is too stupid to notice that it doesn't belong.Judd and Freeman aside, this movie really doesn't have much to recommend it.It's doubly disappointing because the director was also responsible for the far superior, One False Move.

An hour and a half is spent contenplating the fact.The acting is surprisedly well, especially by Caviezel. I didn't understand why he had that outburst at the end, but that's a minor detail. Judd is equally good as Claire, except she seemed to be too slow at some parts. So did the pacing. It seemed to drag on a little, and the genre seemed to be more like a courtroom drama instead of a crime thriller.Morgan Freeman is OK as the lawyer Claire hires. His acting seemed a little forced at times, though. The plot, though nothing new, was one of those that were predictable, but I was enjoying it too much to care. It's very entertaining if you just sit back and watch it instead of scrutinizing every little detail of it.But, at the end, after the final court scene, it seems to continue on for a little long after spending an hour and a half leading up to that part. The running time was a little long. And the ever-lovable Amanda Peet plays a role where she could have gotten more time and shown off her acting ability.

Instead of building a complex web of a storyline, the story instead reverts to reaching at the most impossible and improbable to further the intrigue, and thus lessens it instead. The film draws many parallels with Robert Zemeckis's What Lies Beneath, but lacks both the subtle art and spirited nature of that movie.Claire Kubik (Ashley Judd) is a high-profile lawyer who lives as part of an idyllic marriage. One day her husband Tom Kubik (James Cavizel) is arrested by the FBI for a war crime and a secret past-life of his begins to unravel. Suddenly Claire finds herself defending her husband in a military tribunal that she is not familiar with, along with the help of maverick Marine lawyer Charles Grimes (Morgan Freeman). As expected, everything that could ever possibly go wrong does go wrong, which gives the film an strange pacing in which every time one thinks that the movie is over, it isn't. The story goes to extremes to show how lopsided the odds are by bringing in conspiracies that reach up to Generals, by having the prosecutor be the Marines' top lawyer, by having the defense lawyer be an inexperienced loser, and yada yada.The characters are all flat stereotypes, and ultimately we don't really care about any of them, from the ugly-as-a-dog mad Marine Major Hernandez (Juan Carlos Hernandez), to the seemingly prepubescent young Marine lawyer Lt. Terrence Embry (Adam Scott) assigned to defend Tom, to Claire herself, a caricature of the cool-headed modern female lawyer who, because of her inner-warmth, desperately wants to have a baby. Near the end the crudely typical vengeful South American character stands valiantly at a doorway, reversing his role from throughout the film, and you almost expect him to say &#145;que pasa?'Dialogue in the movie is unoriginal and contrived, but is not poor enough that it stands out, and overall is utterly unremarkable, Ashley Judd exhibits an excellent performance in playing a confused, loving, strong woman, and in her skill highlights the lack of acting ability in James Cavizel, who is ill-matched with her. Morgan Freeman plays the same lovable outcast character we've often seen from him, and he does it well.Theo van de Sande's photography, while neither innovative nor artistic, is wonderfully polished and alternately expresses claustrophobic terror through close shots or dizzying confusion through a twirling, dancing lens at the appropriate times. As is seen often in today's films, Sande uses the color blue very heavily, and also employs a shallow depth of focus.The original score by Graeme Revell is professional enough, but is very generic and boring. In the movie, particularly in the beginning and end, the music awkwardly bounces back and forth between dramatic world music and R&B.When the movie closes, the viewer has gained nothing, but has also lost nothing to this glossy but formulaic movie. Despite its faults, it is an entertaining ride, and the surprise ending (so necessary to complete the movie that it is half-predictable) will act as redemption in the eyes of those who would otherwise leave with a bad taste in their mouths.`High Crimes' is rated PG-13. It contains blurry footage of corpses, conspirator's intimidating violence, humorous prostitutes, and adorable grandfatherly drunkenness.

Her husband Tom (James Caviezel) and she are out Christmas shopping when they are rushed by FBI. Taken into custody, Tom is charged with (sic) Murder First Degree and Desertion. Unbeknownst to Claire, Tom served in the Marine Corps and deserted pending murder charges, for having shot up a Latin American village. With faith in her husband's innocence, Claire, firmly committed to defend her husband, turns down a deal for six years. Together with an immature, inexperienced Marine legal officer and a washed-out civilian attorney, Claire sets out to ferret out the truth. Just what is the truth and does Claire really want to know? The answer is elementary even to dear Watson. Yet the movie does have some fine points about court-martials in spite of its error in using the civilian term Murder first degree. Conflict of Interest In Defence of One's Relations The (American) Code of Professional Responsibility says that a lawyer shall exercise independent professional judgement. Obvious this means that the lawyer must stand above outside pressure to zealously represent the client. Less obviously the lawyer must stand apart from the client as well. Lets see this in action. Claire's decision to represent her husband is a bad but understandable. Close relatives should never undertake representation of family members. Yet the trial bar daily violates this apothegm. Egos the size of Texas fuel trial attorneys. None could possibly imagine anyone better. Yet a lawyer must make tough decisions, give advice clients don't want to hear and divorced from the client's emotions. How can our heroine do that when she has been busy trying to make babies with Tom? This conflict in roles between spouse and lawyer looms to great significance in the rejection of a plea to a lesser offense. The decision to turn down the deal for six years is reprehensible, but once again understandable. Despite clear guilt of desertion, it might not appear such to a loving spouse. A spouse might accept as given Tom's declaration that he deserted out of fear; a court-martial would not. Tom's desertion has two aggravating factors pending charges and in armed conflict. In the military the desertion charge might be considered more serious by many military judges and panel member (jurors) than murdering a foreigner, particularly when the foreigner is killed in reprisal. Punishment parties are regarded as a necessary part of military muscle, even if editors of the Times think it ought not be so. The very admission of such a fear in a military court would cook him and push the sentence to the max. The Times to the country, Clemenceau's adage military justice is to justice as military music is to music still pertains. As stirring as military music might be, even the Air Force, after legendary General Harmon, chose not to keep up with the pop chart. Military Legal Officers JAGs on trial The standard charge given by dear old Judge Dennison in my time in the service read, Military counsel are lawyers duly qualified by the bars of their home state and are certified by the Judge Advocate General to try and defend court-martials. What exactly does that mean? The nerdy military defense counsel is characteristic, not merely a micro-aberration. Most military lawyers are new to law, young and inexperienced. To a polished lawyer they might appear to be utterly incapable. Was I ever that bad?, Claire might have enquired. (You were even if your Texas-sized ego can't admit.) The appeal of the military in recruiting is precisely that the young lawyer will get many early opportunities to defend major cases. Everyone learns somewhere, a thought which perhaps would not seem comforting to Tom but is the very point of JAG recruiting officers. What responds to this call is a wide variety of talent. Do you suppose it could be any different? In this movie, the young lieutenant, if focused at all,concentrates his energies not on the case but on Claire's rather loose sister who has become the defence team's camp follower. Military society is a close one. Thus the prosecutors and defense counsel do more than drink together enemies in court, friends without. Does this work in the defendant's favor? I doubt it. A very sharp prosecutor might have abandoned the war crimes charge which could draw empathy for the accused from a military panel (jury) in order to concentrate on the desertion charge which will earn the accused no favor. Yet, although not discussed in this movie, the military ties the hands of the prosecutor as much or at least as effectively by limiting the prosecutor's tactical discretion as it mutes the defense by over-loading it with youth and inexperience. Effete Liberal Society The movie does not limit itself to a probing critique of the JAG Corps; it strikes out at effete liberal society and its askewed values. Theoretically as part of a commitment to an independent legal profession, civilian society lives by the rule that lawyers must rush to the defence of unpopular causes and unpopular people. Indeed Claire is celebrated for having taken on the defence of slimy characters who have committed evil deeds. But liberal society sanctions defence for some evils and not others. The fanfare and flush of victory in a miscreant's cause are just tapering off when, without much ceremony, Claire is tossed from the exalted corner office for undertaking the defence of an accused war criminal. According to its own standard of political correctness, liberal society picks and chooses which nastiness is nice enough to be defended.

Claire's biggest problem appears to be that she wants to have a baby, and she's having trouble getting pregnant. But when the police investigate a routine break-in at her home, they uncover the truth about her husband's identity, and her life is thrown into turmoil. Claire finds out that her husband's name is actually Ron Chapman, and that he's an ex-marine accused of murdering seven innocent civilians in El Salvador during a raid in the late '80s. He admits that he was there, and that he changed his identity to escape prosecution for the crimes, but he insists that he's innocent, and that the massacre was committed by another soldier under the orders of a powerful general, who is using Ron as a patsy to cover it up. Claire is eventually convinced that Ron's telling the truth. Faced with defending her husband in an unfamiliar military courtroom, Claire enlists the aid of Charles Grimes, an ex-Army judge advocate with an ax to grind. Stonewalled by the military bureaucracy at every turn, they uncover a web of deception and disappearing witnesses, and they soon find their own lives in danger.

However, under the sure direction of Carl Franklin, it is eminently watchable, even if I don't buy Ashley Judd as a forceful criminal lawyer. Judd's husband, an ex-Marine played in his usual stoic manner by Jam C. of Jesus fame, is accused by the military of a village massacre many years earlier in Salvador. Nine innocents died that day. But was he the killer, or was it another member of his platoon? Judd gains the right to co-defend her husband, and also enlists the aid of a has-been criminal lawyer played by Morgah Freeman. It turns out Freeman was once a Marine himself. The trial is reasonably intriguing, punctuated by outbursts of PG-13 violence against both Judd and Freeman, the perpetrators of which include a shadowy figure with a connection to that decimated village. Franklin keeps things moving along pretty well, although a shorter length might have helped. The big climax is not unexpected, one we have seen in a number of similar murder mysteries. Still, I watched this film today for the first time since its release, and found that it holds up remarkably well for a big-budget studio potboiler. See it and judge for yourself. It was probably Judd's last decent screen appearance to date. We also get to see a lot of Amanda Peet's body as Judd's sex-crazed sister. And that's always appreciated.

She turns to disgraced former JAG lawyer Morgan Freeman for help. While often employing typical court room thriller twists and turns this film keeps you involved and interested until it throws out all reason and common sense for a series of bizare and just plain wrongheaded twists at the end of the film that really ruins all the good will the film had built up until that point.

It starts predictably with the happy married couple trying to have a baby, so I see where some may tune out at this point, but it gets better. There are some nice shots of San Francisco and Oakland where Claire practices law.Early into the film, her husband is arrested by the FBI in an overblown scene and charged with 8 murders in Mexico. Military law is not her expertise so her lawyer at the firm recommends attorney Grimes (Freeman).He is a recovering alcoholic and formerly a stellar attorney. He knows all the loopholes and teaches Claire a few in court. There are flashbacks to scenes in Monte Azul where in 1988 several murders took place in South America and there was a military cover-up. A few officers with actors like Michael Shannon and others have bit parts. Amanda Peet is Claire's sister Jackie, and gives the story some comic relief. Breuce Davison is also good as the nefarious General who knows the true facts.Normally the film would be an 8 but Morgan Freeman elevates the performances here and is believable as a man who has hit zero too many times and now must make a comeback. Claire learns a few disturbing truths as well, her life is changed for the better, though she endures a miscarriage and murder attempts as she is defending her husband during the murder trial.Overall a definite must see for anyone who likes a decent story, and Morgan Freeman. 9/10.

Their blissfully happy marriage suddenly goes awry when Tom is arrested and his true identity, Ron Chapman, is revealed.  He's now on trial for the murder of Latin American villagers back when he was in the marines.  Claire goes to work as his lawyer, with the help of Charlie Grimes (Morgan Freeman), a rather unconventional attorney.  Together, they try to uncover the truth behind the incident about what really happened in Latin America all those years back.From a script point-of-view, High Crimes is nothing particularly special.  It's a courtroom drama that also aspires to work as a mystery thriller, though is never exceptional at either.  The film is packed with cliches, be it when Claire is constantly followed by creepy military types, threatened by said people, and given ominous warnings from strangers who may or may not know the truth.  As a matter of fact, a certain Latin American character who actually knows what happened takes so long to tell all, it's positively infuriating.  Come to think of it, he never says anything at all, just all build-up without a pay-off.Carl Franklin's direction lacks in subtlety, but given that this is a Hollywood thriller, it's acceptable.  The obviousness of some of his staging and camerawork make some of the plot twists a bit predictable, particularly that last surprise (which is anything but, once you get past the false ending), but Franklin does keep the pacing tight; High Crimes is never dull for its entire running time, and he manages to craft a few sharp, suspenseful setpieces, particularly during the finale.But what makes High Crimes recommendable and ultimately quite watchable are the performances.  From the lovely Ashley Judd (who needs a better haircut) to the somewhat meek Adam Scott, almost everyone here delivers top-notch performances, most especially Freeman, who can excel in just about any role and continues to prove why he's the best actor around.  This is his second film with Judd, the first being the enjoyable Kiss the Girls, and the chemistry they developed in that movie was no fluke.  They have as strong a rapport as almost any working duo in Hollywood.  Hell, I'd love to see them together in another film again.

But these days, you can't keep your hopes too high when it comes to big Hollywood movies.  Despite its flaws, I was entertained and engrossed by the intriguing, though flawed, storyline.  The performances are great.  Morgan Freeman is enough reason to check this movie out.  Since he's a prestigious actor, he continually waits for a good script to come along, which is why he makes a movie about once or twice a year.  He takes the back seat and plays a supporting role this time around, but the limited time he has on screen is well spent.  In fact, he does something a little different  he plays the comic relief.  His character of an alcoholic, washed-up attorney with a prostitute girlfriend and a house that hasn't been cleaned in ages, leaves much room for humor.  Freeman has some great moments that made me laugh hysterically.  Ashley Judd gives another commanding performance.  Needless to say, she's great eye candy, being one of the most beautiful actresses in showbiz.  And Jim Caviezel, from Angel Eyes and Frequency, gives his best performance up-to-date.  I would get into detail about his performance, but I don't want to give away certain things about his character.  Just see it for yourself. The film does contain the usual array of plot holes and cliches.  In one scene, Ashley Judd is being slowly followed by a car behind her as she's taking a morning jog.  She tries to flee from the car, knocking on the door of an electronics store which is still closed.  As it turns out, the person following her is a woman asking for directions.  First of all that doesn't make sense and second of all we've seen that scenario before.  And speaking of scenarios we've seen before, like in all these types of movies there's always a scene where our main character is abducted by a strange individual who drives him/her to a secret location and exposes all sorts of secrets essential to cracking the case.  Yep, expect to see one of those scenes as well.  You simply have to laugh at this film a little; as I said HAVE FUN.  And the surprise ending is pure Hollywood and I can honestly say I saw it coming from a mile (or two) away.  But it was delivered in a nifty fashion, and I can say that for most of the film.  Besides, it's kinda fun playing Count the Plot Holes.  It's kinda like when you used to watch those old Godzilla movies and look for the zipper in the back of his costume. The sexy Amanda Peet has a short, but scene-stealing role as Judd's chain-smoking sister.  High Crimes is high on fun, as long as you don't take it seriously.  Hell, I can tell Carl Franklin wasn't taking the movie seriously when he made it, adding a good supply of humor.  It doesn't break any new ground, but very few films do nowadays.  If I'm gonna watch a formulaic thriller, I may as well be entertained.

I knew how the story would eventually develop, I knew who were the good and the bad guys, I knew about all the surprises to come. But I suppose that no one would go and see an old Costa Gavra's movie if it was on the billboards, while I imagine lots of people (me included) have parted with their money to see this latest enhanced version.So I am tempted to call this movie a scam, it promises to entertain with something new, but new it isn't. Apart from that, the movie is really average, the acting is mediocre, even Freeman is not convincing as the renegade lawyer, not to mention that the story of the redeemed drunken lawyer has been already seen in about 1,000 movies.But the movie does worse, it convey some negative messages, I think, although I suspect that this effect was not intended1) Lawyers are not really coming out as a nice category, you see a media-self-complacent, couldn't-care-less, top-flyer Ashley Judd in the beginning and you already hate her. When things start happening to her you cannot really be sympathetic, she's just a shark in a pool of sharks.2) The Marines Corp takes a severe beating, almost every Marine in the movie is either an ass, or corrupted, a stupid or a blood thirsty savage. Not to mention that the underlying message about Ron Chapman behaviour is that he acted like that because he was trained to act like that.3) The FBI arrest in the beginning, with a squad of soldiers in combat overall throwing to the ground two civilians at gunpoint is disturbing, either it is not portraying reality, in which case it's gratuitous, or it is, in which case it makes you wonder how can this be the same country that blasts around about freedom, justice and human rights.4) The whole El Salvador subplot makes you wonder once more what were Marines doing in El Salvador?Unfortunately, although I think that the movie makes a very good job in delivering these messages, and in this respect it is an interesting denounce, I have the feeling that this was not the intention of the director, and therefore the movie misses its target twice.

If director Carl Franklin had cast someone with more charisma and more convincing delivery, the movie would have had the element of doubt it needed; admittedly the plot should have focused more on the suspect the way it did, say, on Jeff Bridges in Jagged Edge, but Caviezel's screen absence (as opposed to presence) throws the movie off-balance, and it needs all the help it can get.The movie's reminiscent of a few too many other productions, particularly A Few Good Men and the aforementioned Jagged Edge (among other Joe Eszterhas-scripted movies) - in no small part because of a few gaping loopholes, and the would-be surprise twist in Yuri Zeltser and Cary Bickley's script isn't really surprising, as it's the only way this movie COULD climax. (It's also hard not to think the fisticuffs thrown in are for Token Violence Purposes only - they may as well have thrown in some gratuitous Judd/Peet nudity. Chance would be a fine thing...)It's too competently made and performed to not keep you watching, and it certainly won't be accused of being a recruiting film for the military, but in the end High Crimes is ultimately the sort of thing that shorn of the strong language would fit in quite snugly on TV alongside Perry Mason and JAG.

But in reality, it is a low-thrill thriller, where the court scenes are too light, intersected by after hour scenes, consisting mostly of threats and scare tactics by unknown parties.The movie is about Claire, played by Ashley Judd, whose husband Tom/Ron, played by James Caviezel is being charged by the military for a massacre in Central American.  Claire, being a lawyer, decides to defend the case and enlist the help of a former JAG corp lawyer Charlie Grimes, played by Morgan Freeman.Much of the story consists of intimidation against the defense team, as if they should lay off in exposing the cover up of the massacre.  You would think to yourself who would be doing this?  The prosecutor who wants a conviction no matter what?  The supposed killer who wants a conviction so that he would not end up a suspect?  Some secret group in the government that doesn't want the whole prelude of the massacre exposed, even though the information is classified and as far as they know, it has not been leaked?  We will never know, and once we have the real murderer revealed, every one of these theories goes out the window since none of it will make sense anymore.There are other holes in the story, such as why the boy who witnessed the massacre goes onto describing the event and perpetrator of a previous bombing in such details, only to run out of time to tell the experience that so shocked him and changed his life forever.  If he wanted to let the truth be known to Claire, you don't have to stalk her or take her to a off-limits location, just knock on her door or tell her in his car while driving around.  Or how did he know about some plea deal, did he have some inside information or it is his phone bug?Some things like alcoholism were lightly brushed upon, probably not even worth bringing it up, and it could have been easily avoided if Charlie did not hang around to watch the witness have sex with two prostitutes and eventually reveal the real story to the inquiries of one of the prostitute during their drunken conversation.  All while it is being recorded by a hidden recorder secretly hidden by the prostitute.  See, no Charlie in the role.The bigger deal of the story, the cover-up of the bombing of the café, orchestrated by a Colonial who is now a General in the armed service, is swept under the rug.  I guess some things are more righteous than others, like saving one's husband with the secret past.So as a whole, this movie could be watched as a suspense thriller, albeit a low thrill one, if you don't care if everything fits at the end.  Othewise, watch it only if you don't have anything else to do.

The acting by Ashley Judd is extraordinary, as she continues to prove that she can handle much more complex roles than those given her thus far.  Morgan Freeman's role is almost in a supporting actor category, but his change-of-pace character (which was probably originally written for a white man to play a white trash character) is refreshing.  Freeman always adds zest and depth to every character he inhabits.  Too bad he didn't have more screen time.However, the problem is primarily the plot.  It seems to be a combination of two pretty standard Hollywood storylines, merged for a twist at the end.   By the time the movie was over, my questions were What was this really about?

They want to lock him up big time.Of course Claire takes on his defense and enlists Charlie Grimes (Morgan Freeman, Kiss The Girls, The Unforgiven), a drunken expert on military law to assist her.High Crimes rushes about at a furious pace, presenting red herrings, leaving loose ends and failing to explain itself. It's all about genre rather than substance. It always looks good, filmed to present its stars in a proper Hollywood light, but neglects to allow suspense to grow.

Ashley Judd's performance as a supportive wife and lawyer was portrayed as best as she could, but it fell short of the expectations that I would have put on any other actress in the role.The plot, while formulaic and predictable, is a favorite of many people, as the film has done well since it's premiere. You really start to feel badly for this cunning lawyer (at the beginning of the film) whose world just shatters around her as her perception of all things become untrue. On a scale of all the films I've seen with this sort of premise, I'd rate this one well, as the cast distracted me from Judd's performance.Aside from Ashley Judd, my only gripe is the misuse of Morgan Freeman, who vanished the last 1/4 of the film. Maybe he went off the do another movie with a better actress. I mean, he's the guy who bought the defense team together and got all the CRUCIAL information pertaining to the case, but he pretty much spends the rest of the movie on the telephone. If you're going to have an actor of his caliber in a film, at least use him more.All that being said, there are several redeeming factors in the film. The plot twist is always nice to see.

I do not go out to the movies that often but usually rent videos from the video store. Last week I saw the movie Double Jeopardy with Ashley Judd and Tommy Lee Jones for the first time on video and really enjoyed it. I am one of the people who think most movies made the last few years are bad. While watching Double Jeopardy I realized I instantly liked Ashley Judd. She reminds me a little of Vivian Leigh with her occasional raised eye brow and she looks different whenever she changes clothes. I found her acting to be refreshing and very very good. When I saw she was going to appear in High Crimes which was just released I decided to go to the movies to see it. I was not disappointed either. She continues to fascinate me with her great looks and wonderful acting. With her performance, and throw in a really good performance by Morgan Freeman, you have an enjoyable movie. True, I guessed who done it before it was revealed (My wife did not), but it wa still a good movie and not the usual waste of my money. I am sure it won't win any academy awards, but is enjoyable to watch and that is all I ask. "},{"Title":"Another paint-by-numbers, cliché-ridden Hollywood thriller. You asked for it!","Date":"6 April 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":"  Since you paid to see something like this last time, Hollywood has made for you another mediocre thriller/courtroom drama. Pulling out all of the stops and cliches you'd expect, there's nothing new here in this by-the-numbers blockbuster in waiting.  Although the star power is good (Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman&#133;you bought it last time, remember?), the story has more holes than Swiss cheese. While in the duration of the film, the movie seems to roll along just fine, but leaves you walking out of the theater thinking, Wait a minute! How&#133;. (insert plot hole here). You're expected to believe many things or assume certain events happen without clarification of their actual existence.Freeman, of course, is solid and is always a delight to watch, even if he is stuck in a movie like this. Judd, in her usual beautiful and assured mode, does pretty well, but just seems too glamorous at all of the wrong times. Something about her back-of-the-head-in-a-wind-tunnel doesn't seem to do much for her, either. Somehow she always seems to be perfectly made up and have just the right light on her, even in the face of danger. Jim Caviezel is a little deadpan and hardly likeable as Judd's husband on trial, making it hard to care if he wins or not. Something about the couple's chemistry seems a little contrived.Director Carl Franklin (Devil In a Blue Dress) knows how to make a popcorn flick and did exactly what he needed to do to make a trim, fast paced Hollywood thriller. It's no fault of his that the movie caves in at certain times. That again, falls back to the script, a poor adaptation of Joseph Finder's novel.This is one of the weaker films in this genre and it's really a shame. If you don't mind cliché-ridden flicks just for the sake of glazed-eyes entertainment, then maybe this is for you. In fact, if you pay for this one, remember that you're asking for another!

What's even more cliche is the succesful bay area couple living in Marin.  Based on this one often wonders what studio exec picks what stories to creat which movies.It's not really a bad film as such.  That is there're no flying saucers where you can see the wire suspending it, nor boom shadows, nor talentless models placed in lead rolls because they want to become actresses (and their husband's flipping the production bill).  None of that's there. It's just a giant collection of predictable cliches that any hack novelist could've cranked out.  The characters are likeable, but mostly because we have competent actors portraying them.  Were that not the case then this film would've really stunk.One of the rules of creating succesful suspense-thrillers is that they be suspensful and thrilling.  This movie was neither.  Every scene was a oh yeah, gotta have one of those in there... type of deal, because otherwise a blind man could've seen the plot-twists coming from a mile away.If you like the suspense genre then you may want to put this on your bonus rental list, otherwise pass it up.

I didn't actually _read_ the book but I did listen to a book on tape version of it, and I have to say -- all together now, class ;-) -- the book was better.  There were some fairly major elements which were simply omitted in the movie; about the whole first hour or so of developments in the audiotape version were chopped and the movie more or less jumped in at that point, which was OK (you can't put the whole thing on film or it would be 6 hours long!) but in the audiotape version you get to know the characters more before the trial, which makes for more interest in the subsequent events.  The movie leaps almost right into the trial, which creates a totally different feel to the story.  Then, too, in the book Claire had a daughter plus at least one other notable character was removed from the story altogether; they did a competent job of those excisions, but it gave the movie a more barren feel, in my impression (compared to the book).They changed the young black Marine lawyer into a young white Marine lawyer, which I guess was done so they could install some hanky-panky into the film (interracial hanky-panky is too scary, I guess??).There were other smaller items left out, such as the whole ballistics analysis and a lot of witness testimony, which was well written, and which I think would have played well on film.  Also, they tacked on a different ending; the book's had more emotional punch, IMO.What they did do, they did reasonably well; the cast was very good, and the film was quite well made aside from my complaints about the plot.

But bonding of apparent opposites is the core of so many crime and law thrillers that their competence here can be admired but hardly taken too seriously.Ashley Judd's Claire Kubik is a very successful lawyer aiming at partnership in what is obviously a prestigious firm.  Because of serious prosecutorial misconduct - not through a legal technicality - she secures a mistrial for an alleged rapist at the beginning of the film.  She returns in triumph to her high rise San Francisco law firm where, despite not being a partner, she has a CORNER office with a great view! That's enough to get me and any of my colleagues who have worked in big law firms laughing while settling down for more, guaranteed absurdity.Of course the new trial secured by Claire's brilliant legal work is meant to introduce the audience to her and drum into the mind of the least perceptive that this is a top lawyer.  Don't mess with her.Following short scenes of deep and true marital bliss Claire's husband is taken into custody by the ultimate SWAT Team and she learns she may have been trying to get pregnant by a husband with a past, a very bad one.A Marine Corps court-martial, interspersed with out-of-court chicanery, intrigue and very improbable bad times for Claire and her friends follow.  The outstanding Morgan Freeman comes to her aid.  Freeman, a former Marine Corps lawyer and now private practitioner and sometime drunk, tries to give her the skivvy on the reality of a court-martial.  To make sure the audience understands that fairness isn't the primary goal, forget about justice, Freeman intones the hoary aphorism, Military justice is to justice as military music is to music.  Hey, military music is stirring!Rounding out the Good Guys cast is a stumbling young first lieutenant as assigned defense counsel.  All I can say about this character is that if he was one of my former law students I might seriously consider a new line of work.  A ditzy sister adds...lustrous bedroom eyes, nice skin and little else.Everyone connected with the Marine Corps except for the assigned defense lawyer is either sleazy, corrupt or stupid.  A couple of characters exhibit all three qualities.  The highest ranking bad guy sports the Congressional Medal of Honor.There is familiar, predictable and we've-seen-it-all-before tension before the shocking denouement.  I am not sure why others in the audience weren't laughing out loud with me at the end.Those who write the scripts for and direct Military Justice films either have never served or, if they did, they have a lasting desire for revenge.  I have not seen more  consistent, polarized, inaccurate and downright silly film depictions of the trial process than those dealing with the armed forces, any branch (I think only the Coast Guard has so far escaped cinematic pillorying on the screen).  It's been a long time since the deeply moving unravelling of Humphrey Bogart as he nervously rubbed two steel balls together.BUT...Ashley Judd is a wonderful actress and I was not only rooting for her to come out okay in this film, I was fervently hoping she has much better roles in the near future.Overall, unless you're a Judd fan as I am, wait for the rental.  But if you never see this film, don't worry.  Another flat swipe at our military and its justice system will be along before you know it.

The movie is definitely an entertaining Hollywood thriller, military court drama with suspense and action, led by the second pairing (previously in Kiss the Girls 1997) of Judd and Freeman - a strong reason to see the film besides it's director Carl Franklin of One False Move 1991 (written by Billy Bob Thornton, Bill Paxton leads), Devil in a Blue Dress 1995 (Denzel Washington with Jennifer Beals), and One True Thing 1998 (Meryl Streep, Renee Zellweger and William Hurt). One might say it's been done before, the imminent shadows and dangers kinda expected as you follow the plot, several red herrings (whom do you believe/which version is the truth) and a foreseen/surprised twist, but Freeman and Judd's presence made it worthwhile. It's taut drama well paced, you'd find yourself smiling and catching a chuckle now and then for momentary relief. There's a right dose of supporting cast Jim Caviezel is Judd's husband with a past, Amanda Peet as Judd's energetic uninhibited sister, Adam Scott as the young coy military lawyer, and a brief appearance by Bruce Davison as a brigadier general. Location is mainly in San Francisco - probably showing SF locals some city spots that we hardly realize how 'photogenic' such street locales/building structures can be in a movie setting! The film gained atmospheric enhancement from New Zealand born composer Graeme Revell's music score; his works include Dead Calm 1989, Strange Days 1995, suspenseful action thrillers like Schwarzenegger's Collateral Damage 2002, and sci-fi animated/comic strip features including Titan A.E. 2000. For mere entertainment, HIGH CRIMES is satisfying enough. If you want more substance and quality screenplay, and true filmwork, try British director John Boorman's Point Blank 1967 intriguing plot twists, a subtle character performance from Lee Marvin, along with Angie Dickinson Keenan Wynn, brief appearance from Carroll O'Connor, fascinating suspense/action sequences, creative camera approaches and editing (to the point of artistic), shot on location in Los Angeles, with scenes on Alcatraz in San Francisco - it's beyond a mere thriller. It's a masterpiece in every respect.Also just caught on TCM cable channel a worthwhile film noir by director Fritz Lang, The Big Heat 1953, with the ever so natural Glenn Ford as the cop detective entangled in the 'heat' of it all, with ravishing Gloria Grahame as gangster Lee Marvin's moll, also Jocelyn Brando (Brando's sister) as Ford's cop wife. Everything you expect in a film noir you get - truly a gem! Ah, a well-cut diamond of a crime/robbery 'film noir' in color is director Don Siegel's Charley Varrick 1973 with superb action and performance from Walter Matthau (Joe Don Baker is the Mob hired hunter) - I'd say it's a must see!For in depth work from the three leads Morgan Freeman is fantastic in director Neil LaBute's Nurse Betty 2000 playing opposite Rene Zellweger and with a talented ensemble cast; Ashley Judd's substantial debut lead role in director Victor Nunez's Ruby In Paradise 1983 with actor Todd Field (writer-director of In the Bedroom 2001) is highly recommended; Jim Caviezel, besides his recent The Count of Monte Cristo 2002 opposite Guy Pearce and Frequency 2001 with Dennis Quaid, he was quite convincing in his role opposite Jennifer Lopez in Angel Eyes 2001.

Morgan Freeman costars as the typical gone-to-seed, down-on-his-luck (but, we are told, brilliant) lawyer who has lost both reputation and career to the ravages of alcoholism. As in most films of this ilk, the military in `High Crimes' emerges as little more than a hotbed of skullduggery and corruption, with the top brass issuing unethical and undoubtedly illegal orders, then doing everything it can do make sure the facts surrounding those activities remain forever hidden from public view &#150; even stooping to rubbing out uncooperative witnesses if necessary.  As a whodunit, `High Crimes' follows a fairly predictable path filled with the inevitable false clues, misunderstandings and, of course, the surprise `twist' ending, which really isn't a surprise at all to anyone even remotely familiar with the way this kind of story operates.  `High Crimes,' though watchable, is also depressingly efficient in that it simply goes through the motions without injecting anything even remotely original or surprising into the proceedings.  With a sinister figure lurking in every shadow and a red herring hiding around every corner, we soon grow weary of the sheer predictability of the whole enterprise.  There literally is not a single original minute in the entire film.`High Crimes' isn't bad enough to make anyone jump up out of his seat in outrage &#150; unless it happens to be the military, which certainly has every reason to feel affronted in this case.  Luckily, Judd and Freeman are good enough actors that they can make even this mediocre material seem better than it is.  One would, however, like to see them putting their very considerable talents to more effective use and stop wasting them on forgettable formulaic drivel like `High Crimes.'

A seemingly perfect couple with everything going for them, that is until Tom's past comes back to haunt him as he is arrested by the Military for the murder of 9 people in an event that took place in L Salvador in 1988. To prove that her husband is innocent Claire (an high powered U.S. attorney) agrees to defend him by taking his case along with a former Marine who is now a very smart Military attorney named Charles Grimes (Morgan Freeman). As the case is progressed we learn different interesting facts about that certain day in 1988. Along with the help of Claire's sister (Amanda Peet) and her newly found boyfriend Lieutenant Embry (Adam Scott) the pair start to slowly piece together what had happened on that day through the help of a few outsiders who were either there on the day or knew a lot about the day. As events like attempted murder and house robbery start to happen it looks as though Tom was framed and didn't commit those tragic murders after all. For more information you will have to see the film yourself.Anyway, it's a good story and really kept my interest until the near end of the film, that's when I started rolling my eyes. Why? Because, the ending in this movie is nothing you and I haven't seen before. It (the ending) has been done and over done. But, there is one thing that about this film that struck me as excellent so to speak, and that is the acting! The acting and direction in this film is all top-notch, Morgan Freeman, Ashley Judd, and Jim Caveisel give what I would a captivating performance. The two other leads (Peet and Scott) also do a great job as they make their characters believable to an extent. But, like I said This is nothing but a good movie, that was partly ruined by the over-done ending. If they would changed the ending and made something new, this film would have gotten a 9/10 from me, but for right now I will stick with an 8/10.

Pulling out all of the stops and cliches you'd expect, there's nothing new here in this by-the-numbers blockbuster in waiting.Although the star power is good (Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman&#133;you bought it last time, remember?), the story has more holes than Swiss cheese. While in the duration of the film, the movie seems to roll along just fine, but leaves you walking out of the theater thinking, Wait a minute! How&#133;. (insert plot hole here). You're expected to believe many things or assume certain events happen without clarification of their actual existence.Freeman, of course, is solid and is always a delight to watch, even if he is stuck in a movie like this. Judd, in her usual beautiful and assured mode, does pretty well, but just seems too glamorous at all of the wrong times. Something about her back-of-the-head-in-a-wind-tunnel doesn't seem to do much for her, either. Somehow she always seems to be perfectly made up and have just the right light on her, even in the face of danger. Jim Caviezel is a little deadpan and hardly likeable as Judd's husband on trial, making it hard to care if he wins or not. Something about the couple's chemistry seems a little contrived.Director Carl Franklin (Devil In a Blue Dress) knows how to make a popcorn flick and did exactly what he needed to do to make a trim, fast paced Hollywood thriller. It's no fault of his that the movie caves in at certain times. That again, falls back to the script, a poor adaptation of Joseph Finder's novel.This is one of the weaker films in this genre and it's really a shame. If you don't mind cliché-ridden flicks just for the sake of glazed-eyes entertainment, then maybe this is for you. In fact, if you pay for this one, remember that you're asking for another!

Gosh, great on-screen partnership chemistry! Would they prevail as defense lawyers for a man charged with a 13-year old atrocity?

Okay, it's not an ultra smart thriller, but it does work like an adrenaline-pumping pendulum, swinging between the implausible and the predictable. And the segments of red herrings, false alarms, dead ends, and reversal of expectations have kept me focused to the screen.I'm not too sure whether Amanda Peet's role does much for this flick, and her presence does remind me of a fish out of water! Otherwise, I'd say this film definitely is character-driven, and every cast member plays his/her part solidly in the combat of a losing battle. Gosh, it's not easy to guess who's to be trusted! And that's suspense enough for me! James Caviezel is certainly the right actor for his role, and Adam Scott's character falls nicely into the plot. Nice camera shots too,  that gradually swerve the audience from the dazzling beauty of SFO into the dusty suburbia, encompassing the military base.I would certainly recommend this movie to anyone with a taste for movies that are nerve-testing!

But as another reviewer said, any film with morgan freeman is usually worth seeing, even if it does little more than kill a Saturday night at home.Initially, Ashley Judd's husband is charged with murder, but claims to be totally innocent. Conveniently, his wife (Judd) is a criminal lawyer who pulls out all stops to save him from the death penalty. But as the story unfolds, we begin to learn that there is more to her husband's background than meets the eye.But just as you begin to suspect that Ashley Judd's husband may be guilty, the spring recoils and we are subsequently convinced that her husband is completely innocent.But the major problem is that at the end of the film, after he is freed and the case is dropped for reasons of national security, we finally learn that he really is a bad guy after all... and that's supposed to be the big twist!!! In other words, it is a predictable film that temporarily becomes very self-conscious and tries to avoid being predictable. Yet the final big twist is just what you predicted about half way through. I just wish that they could make films like this without their being a stunning final twist at the end. The only film of this genre that it was really effective in pulling it off was Along came a spider simply because the twist was fairly original and almost seemed to be naturally incorporated into the story (rather than forced into it for 'shock' value).The stand out of this film is Morgan Freeman's dry sense of humour throughout the film.

I wouldn't rank High Crimes anywhere near that film in terms of story or acting. But, really, it only suffers by comparison to that similar movie. Taken on its own High Crimes is actually a pretty good effort with a fair amount of suspense, the odd dose of humour and while I can't say that the climax of the story was a complete surprise (the possibility was always there, and it could only have gone two ways anyway) I really didn't know how it would turn out until it was revealed.I can't say that the performances blew me away. Morgan Freeman was, as always, quite good as Charlie Grimes, a former Marine Corps lawyer who fell on hard times. Aside from Freeman, though, I didn't think anyone was outstanding. Ashley Judd was good as defence attorney Claire Kubik, who chooses to defend her own husband in the unfamiliar (for her) territory of a military courtroom. I thought James Caviezel was disappointing as her husband Ron/Tom. For the most part I didn't think he captured the emotional angst that would be expected in these circumstances, and in the few occasions when emotion was called for, he didn't come across as believable to me. Adam Scott as Lt. Embry (the young military lawyer first assigned to the case) and Amanda Peet as Claire's sister Jackie really didn't do much for me.However, the story was decent enough and Morgan Freeman always pulls any movie up a notch or two.

Predictable and uninspired, High Crimes is almost completely forgettable save for its stylish direction and solid work from Freeman and Judd. Freeman deserves better than this, he's a gifted actor who elevates the material he's given to work with, but I would like to see him in a truly meaty role that would challenge him. Judd, I think, needs to spend more time considering her career choices.

Unfortunately because of that attitude I have been exposed to some absolutely horrible movies.  'Save The Last Dance' was horrible, 'What Women Want' was horrible.  This movie as well, though not as much as the other two I mentioned, was horrible.  Its true that it is formulaic.  Its true then that it's predictable.  But thats no excuse for poor direction and laugh out loud dialogue. First of all, I must discuss my disgust with Amanda Peet for being in this movie.  These are the kind of movies (along with 'Whipped') that killed careers.  Whoever her manager is should be fired instantly.  Her character is unimportant in many ways, and every line she utters is like someone sticking a tack in your head and then twisting it for a little while.  Meanwhile, Ashley Judd doesn't fair a whole lot better.  This is a typical Ashley Judd role though.  She gets beaten, then she cries some.  You go girl.  And then I wonder whats up with Morgan Freeman.  How do you go from 'The Shawshank Redemption' to this piece of, well, its a piece of something.  Of course we couldn't get through drivel like this without the usual array of plot twists to keep us on the edge of our seats.  Well, in my case it would be shaking my head in disgust, and my neck hurts after all of the disgust I had to endure during this movie.  Of course some of it was sooooo bad that it did make me laugh.  By that time it was just out of frustration of course.  (***SPOILER LINES***) I must comment on the last plot twist, which I'm sure most of you could guess.  Its not the twist that was the problem, but there is a fight scene in the last moments in the movie, and it was the worst lit fight scene I have ever seen.  It was at night, and the action is so poorly followed and edited that you actually can't tell who is hitting who, and who is getting hit.  Until the closeup of the man on the floor, you're never sure who got beaten up.  That was just absolutely horrible and it disgusts me thinking about it now, thinking that somehow a studio executive said that this movie was suitable for viewing. (***END OF SPOILER***)In conclusion, I am going to say this.  Ashley Judd, if you ever happen to read this, I challenge you to pick one movie, just one, that isn't this insipidly bad.  I challenge you to pick a movie where the story doesn't seem as if it was told by a five year old, and has a constant narrative flow.  Find a director that can pace the action so it is tolerable and who knows how to piece a movie together.  Please, save your career now, while you still have a chance.  Don't make another 'Where The Heart Is', but do something good for a change.  I know that there's talent in your family, and obviously you have to have some.  Find someone that will exploit it properly for once.  I don't want to see you in another 'Double Jeopardy'.  Step up to the big leagues, please.

A past of which you've never had so much as a hint or knew existed?  It's a situation that is examined by director Carl Franklin in `High Crimes,' a film that is part courtroom drama, part suspense/thriller (with emphasis on the latter), and which illustrates the facility with which the black and white definition of someone's life can in a moment be tainted and overwhelmed by shades of gray.  And it becomes, then, a story about courage and commitment, and most importantly, trust and truth, the basic ingredients that make up the mortar that holds our society and our very lives together; and as this film points out, if the mixture of that mortar is not pure, it is a very tentative seal, indeed, that binds us together.Claire Kubik (Ashley Judd) seemingly has the perfect life; she's a successful criminal defense attorney (about to become a partner in the firm), has a beautiful home in the San Francisco Bay area and a wonderful husband, Tom (James Caviezel), with whom she is hoping to have a baby soon, which would make her life complete.  Then suddenly, it all comes crashing down around her, when Tom is arrested by the F.B.I. and charged with murder. And, as if that's not bad enough, it's a military case-- Tom is facing a court martial stemming from an incident in 1988 when Tom was serving in the U.S. Marine Corps.The incident occurred in El Salvador; after the bombing of a restaurant in which three Americans were killed, a detachment of Marines-- Tom's unit-- was sent to a small village in pursuit of the rebel terrorist responsible for the bombing.  According to the military intelligence that had been gathered, the villagers there would have information about the perpetrator. But as the interrogations began, things went bad somehow, and some of the villagers ended up dead.  And fingers pointed to Tom as the shooter.Claire, of course, believes that Tom is innocent, and decides to take on the case-- and the military-- herself.  She feels confident in her ability to defend him and get to the truth.  After all, she has a strong case-- if only she can uncover the identity of the real shooter, then prove it in a court of law that operates within parameters that extend beyond her personal frame of reference.As can be expected with a film like this, there is much more to it than meets the eye, and director Franklin does a great job of putting his characters (and his audience) through their paces with it.  There are a number of forks in the road along the way to the climax, and he puts them all to good use, building the tension and maintaining it right up to the very end.  He spends just enough time in the courtroom scenes to make them effective; he does not dwell on them nor linger there.  Instead, he keeps most of the story elsewhere, which works well, because that's where the action and the thrills reside.  Most importantly, he keeps it all moving right along and keeps you guessing; he never tips his hand too soon, and it makes for some riveting suspense.Franklin knows how to handle his actors, too, and he gets some first rate performances out of them, especially from Judd and Morgan Freeman, who are great on-screen together (as they were in their previous collaboration, `Kiss the Girls,' in 1997).  Judd is charismatic and has a down-to-earth persona she manages to bring to whatever character she is playing that enables the audience to connect with her.  Her Claire is professional, but well grounded-- which gives something of a fresh face to the usual portrayal of lawyers in film, and she's entirely convincing, which, of course, adds much to the credibility of the story.  As with any good actor, the essence of her character can be found in her eyes, which honestly reflects who this person really is.  Judd gives so much more than a by-the-numbers performance, and she gets results accordingly; Claire is very real, and because of that, you care what happens to her.As Charlie Grimes, the former Marine lawyer (who back in the day had more than some trouble with the system of military justice) now in a less-than-thriving private practice, Morgan Freeman effectively creates a memorable character, bringing that extra something to the part-- as he has in films throughout his career-- with yet another excellent performance. Freeman has a natural quality that comes through so well on screen (as it certainly does here), he always gives his best, and he makes it look so easy while he's doing it.  A good job from one of the finest actors around.Caviezel also does a convincing turn as Tom, as does Adam Scott, as Lt. Terrence Embry, the young attorney assigned by the Marines to Tom's case, and Amanda Peet, as Jackie Grimaldi, Claire's somewhat irresponsible sister.The supporting cast includes Tom Bower (Agent Mullins), Michael Gaston (Waldron), Juan Carlos Hernandez (Hernandez), Jude Ciccolella (Farrell) and Emilio Rivera (Attacker).  A well crafted and delivered thriller that will get and keep you emotionally involved, `High Crimes' is entertaining, but frustrating, as well.  It keeps you on the edge of your seat while taunting you with the absolutes of a military tribunal that makes the term `Military justice' seem like an oxymoron; there are times, in fact, when you'll want to yell at the screen and plead for someone or other to use some common sense and acknowledge the proof of what's placed right in front of them. But it's all a part of the ride, and it's a good one; it is, in fact, the magic of the movies.  8/10.

The only reason for them to be doing so is because the accused is innocent and proving that will embarrass the government and/or the Marine Corps. But it turns out the accused was guilty as sin. So why were the Marines trying to black-bag Judd and Freeman? About the only mainstream action films I've ever seen that were worse than this are No Retreat, No Surrender (when the ghost of Bruce Lee showed up speaking badly dubbed English, 2/3 of the audience in the theater got up and left) and the Burt Reynolds movie Heat (the DVD version isn't gawdawful (merely awful), but the theatrical release looked like 3 badly done attempts at a TV pilot movie cobbled together into some sort of revenue-recovery-project movie).Not even if you're an fan of bad movies should see this piece of garbage.

But she is perfect as the liberal, inhibited young sister.2) America has an extrovert relationship with violence, thus with military that is its legalized form. So she can do movies about wars (Vietnam, Gulf, Cold-war) or the military world (this one for example). In France, all those things are kept hidden under the rug and french citizen are forbidden to watch movies about decolonization, Indochine, Algeria, ... This is the real trademark of my country no movies on politics, institutions. The facts aren't distributed by movies in France thus it's hard to have an opinion in my country and I don't really think we can call us a true democracy.That's why a movie like this is like a breath of fresh air, above it depicts the the big mute (the nickname of the army in France) as well indeed a big mute... However, if the cast is talented and we feel a good chemistry between Jude and Freeman, the movie doesn't really kick-ass. Maybe it's because the classified crimes is a bit too faraway.

I liked the sister since she was so darned cute in that Tedesco Bruce Willis movie. Caviezel was perfect-- playing a whole hour and a half while still being not too sympathetic so we can hate him at the end. What is less than stunning is the plot. Yeah its tired and hackneyed, but the real crime is the twist at the end. Well, it really is not a twist, its some FSF (film school fuc&s*) who decided it would be cool to screw everyone's head. That is the only reason to do this in a movie, to giggle and show complete contempt for the audience. There may be cocaine abuse involved-- chop chop chop snooooooort--- and yeah man, lets make so he really did it. I think it was just so plotlistically bankrupt that they felt that they had to do something really dramatically stupid for the ending. A twist would OK, we like twists. let's see what's a good twist-- maybe Morgan and a couple Marines are gay? Or have the sister cheating with Ashley Judd's husband before he goes to jail, and its a big drama deal, and Ashley forgives him, and then she has the baby and its black. That would be a nice twist. Morgan, you dog.So when a plot sucks this bad but the acting is brilliant, a good editor might be able to restructure the movie but it surely could have been saved with a couple weeks of re-shoots. OK, I hate that Caveziel guy, so lets have him be an abusive husband and she wants to get a divorce, but he has some hold on her. So lets have her frame him for the crime, and then her boss at the high-tone law firm finds out she did this to get a divorce, and we are all worried for her, but the twist at the end is that this is why they make her a partner, since after all, lawyers are fun to call scumbags. We need that sister in the flick, she is so darn perky, so lets have Morgan get it on with her. After all, he doesn't get to chain up Christina Ricci like Samuel Jackson did, so we need something to get him to agree to the re-shoots.So Cavaziel ends up the schmuck, maybe a cuckolded schmuck, Morgan and the sister do a nice interracial soft-porn featurette, and the female lead reaffirms our shared hatred of the legal profession. I would be glib saying $85 mil US gross, but I suspect we could squeeze $56-58 million out of it. Maybe $60 mil if we do some action figures as a tie-in.*Gratuitous Wag the Dog reference.

In the last film in which I saw her, Double Jeopardy, she played a woman living a seemingly idyllic middle-class life in a beautiful home on America's Pacific seaboard, a life that was suddenly shattered when she discovered some unpleasant truths about her husband. In High Crimes she plays a woman living a seemingly idyllic middle-class life in a beautiful home on America's Pacific seaboard in this case San Francisco rather than Washington State), a life that is suddenly shattered when she discovers some unpleasant truths about her husband.Ashley's character in High Crimes is Claire Kubik, a successful criminal defence lawyer. The shock to her comfortable, ordered existence comes when her husband, Tom, is arrested by a squad of heavily armed men while they are out shopping just before Christmas. At first Claire is in the dark about the reasons for the arrest, but gradually everything becomes clear. It appears that her husband's real name is not Tom Kubik but Ron Chapman, that he is a deserter from the US Marines who has been living under a false name and that he is wanted in connection with an incident in El Salvador in the 1980s when several villagers were murdered during a covert operation by the Marines. (This is simply a plot device- there is no attempt to explore the rights and wrongs of the Reagan administration's policy towards Central America). Ron is charged with these murders under military law, which means that he could face the death penalty if found guilty. Claire has little confidence in the inexperienced young lawyer assigned to the defence and decides to defend her husband herself, as she is convinced of his innocence. Because she has no experience of courts-martial, however, she needs the assistance of Charlie Grimes, a leading expert in military law, who has become a broken-down alcoholic after being dishonourably discharged from the service. There is also a sub-plot involving a romance between the young officer and Claire's sluttish sister.I would agree with another reviewer on this board that there are strong similarities between this film and Costa-Gavras's Music Box, which also features a young female lawyer defending a family member (in that case her father) against allegations that he was involved in war crimes. There are also similarities with another courtroom drama from the same period, Presumed Innocent. In both that film and in High Crimes the case against the defendant, which previously seemed strong, suddenly collapses towards the end of the film, paving the way for further revelations. High Crimes, however, is not as good as either of those films. Both of them contained some excellent acting performances, from Jessica Lange and Armin Mueller-Stahl in Music Box and from Harrison Ford, Raul Julia and Greta Scacchi in Presumed Innocent. In High Crimes, however, the acting is less distinguished; even Morgan Freeman, an actor normally worth watching, can do little with his material.The main difference, however, between High Crimes and those two films is that it is much less gripping. In Music Box and Presumed Innocent the final twist does not come until the very end of the film, which means that the tension is maintained. In High Crimes, the rather predictable plot twist comes about two-thirds of the way through. After the charges against Ron are dropped, it is suddenly revealed that he is in fact guilty of the charges against him. What had been one type of standard thriller- brilliant lawyer fights to vindicate client's innocence - is suddenly transformed into another, namely woman in danger from violent husband, and the two parts of the film do not hang together well. In the first we are led to believe that Ron is an innocent man being framed by corrupt military officers in order to cover up their part in the affair. In the second, we have to accept that he is in fact a violent murderer. While this is a better film than Double Jeopardy, which contained several plot holes and an egregious legal error, it is nevertheless an undistinguished, run-of-the-mill thriller. 5/10 "},{"Title":"A little too much faith?","Date":"2 September 2005","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" Poor Claire Kubik.

Well, if the book's author understands and agrees with that, shouldn't we, if we are intelligent viewers??Critic Ebert gives a very accurate review of the movie. Ashley Judd is such a good actress, she is good in everything. As is Morgan Freeman, and it is obvious that they get along well on and off the screen. Here she plays a tough, competent lawyer who happens to be married to an ex-Marine. Freeman plays an ex-military lawyer who comes to her aid when her husband is arrested and accused of murder 12 years earlier in a Central American raid on a civilian village.SPOILERS, SPOILERS ** Through most of the film it appears that her husband is innocent and being set up by others, to cover up an illegal operation.  Near the very end, Freeman's nosing around in Mexico leads him to the truth, that her husband really was guilty. When he finds out she knows, an ugly showdown in their workshop ensues, her husband ends up dead. She and Freeman end up opening a law practice together.Every fictional story needs fabricated situations to set up subsequent story elements. Authors are just not smart enough to figure out what might happen in reality. I accept most of them as good storytelling, but one was very obviously too big a stretch to come off believably. Judd and Freeman were in a car at night and suddenly, a small explosion followed by oil sprayed on their windshield. What would you or I or anyone else do in that situation??  Slow down and stop to assess the situation, and let the vehicle pestering us get further ahead. What does Judd's character do?

You cannot win against these kind of cliche roles, especially not if you don't even try.

I've mentioned before, but I'll repeat, you've seen one good thriller, then you've seen them all. While it seemed like the director had good intentions, he tried too hard to shock the audience when really I could had written a better script. Another problem I had is that Ashley and Morgan are getting stereotyped, well Ashley more than Morgan, because they are signing onto these thrillers with the shocking ending. It gets old, they couldn't do it really after the excellent crime thriller Kiss the Girls.When all is said and done, you're really just looking at the case of the movie when it ends and wondering why you bothered because you knew what would happen. Like I said, the cast wasn't the main problem, it was just script writing and the director's fault. There were some things I had questioned, like Ashley's character's reactions at certain times. They didn't seem appropriate or on cue when needed. Morgan was the only actor who was true and original, he and Jim had carried the film doing the best they could with what they had.If you want a predictable thriller, I would recommend, but I mean you can really save the watch. It's just not exciting any more to see them and the script could have been written by a 15 year old that has seen one too many high action crime thrillers.5/10 "},{"Title":"Another one for anyone","Date":"10 September 2002","Score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":"  Average thriller in every way. Sometimes less than average. Many clues which aren't followed up. The end surprising, but you have been more surprised before.Ashley Judd goes on routine, but that routine takes her a rather long way. Much energy in Amanda Peet, being a talented comedienne and it's strange she isn't used much more as a type. Best is perhaps Bruce Davison as the Marine Brigadier, although it probably isn't very difficult playing such parts. Morgan Freeman is doing another Morgan Freeman.

The reason for this is that it has too many diversions into peripheral characters and matters and not enough focus and development of the title theme, which is the high crimes of some bigwig soldiers. And actually they should be traced back to the White House, the CIA, and the Departments of State and Defense, but the script and story do not go there. They hardly even go to the bigwig soldier.The picture emerges in the end as an average court room type story with some thriller elements layered into it or added to it as it nears its conclusion.The two main characters in the story are clichéd. There is the bright female defense attorney in Ashley Judd. There is the ex-alcoholic lawyer in Morgan Freeman. Some of the lesser characters are both unnecessary and clichéd, like the youthful and inexperienced Marine lawyer and Judd's sister.I saw no romantic sparks at all between Judd and her husband, played by Jim Caviezel. I found it hard to believe that her character matched up with him in the first place.One of the bright spots in the script was how national security was used several times to cover up the internal goings on of the military. This spot should have been even brighter, but it was let drop. Beyond placing this convenient blockade into the mouths of people who wanted to keep their dark deeds secret, neither Judd nor Freeman ever discussed it or made an attempt to raise it at the trial or made an attempt to get the media to discuss it.In this movie and some other recent thrillers I've seen that have car crashes, there seems to be no such thing as an air bag that deploys.This kind of Hollywood movie uses certain elements of reality in an unrealistic way. It makes no serious and yet dramatic attempt to delve more deeply into the social-political matters that it introduces. Death squads fostered by American advisors was and is a very serious matter. It is less a question of Marines being involved than special forces and/or CIA contingents. This story instead focuses on a bad apple in the barrel, with the Marines trying to clean house. The high crimes aspect is left confused at the end. Even the allegiance of Caviezel when he was in Central America is left foggy.The movie introduces a surprise bad guy toward the end and then has him behaving in a nonsensical way. This was ineffective. The idea of it is actually a very good idea, reminiscent of a Suspicion kind of movie, but where the suspicion is true. If this idea had been started earlier in the movie and kept going, intensifying as it went along, this would have made for some really good tension. This is because Judd would have been defending her husband while her suspicions of him were festering.The Freeman character is superfluous to this story. The producers seemed to have been afraid that Judd and/or her character in the script were not strong enough to attract the paying customers.

Turns out that in another life, her husband was Sgt. Ron Chapman of the Marine Corps. He's accused of massacring 9 civilians in Central America. She wants to defend him herself, but she doesn't know anything about military law. In this regard, she finds a washed up recovering alcoholic (Morgan Freeman) to assist her.This is an entertaining film with an excellent cast, but it's also a confusing story with an unnecessary subplot involving Amanda Peet and Adam Scott, who is a young military man put on the case.Even though Freeman plays a stereotypical character present in many films through the years, he still manages to be excellent and rises above the stereotype. Judd has the workhorse role, and she's great. Handsome Jim Caviezel gives a strong performance in the smallest of the lead roles.I'd say the cast and direction are the best things about High Crimes, with the script coming in dead last due to some confusing elements. Certainly worth renting.

And even worse that attack was carried by members of that same special team that gunned down, thinking that they were either hiding or in sympathy with the already dead terrorist, the totally innocent Salvadoran peasants the very next day!It's now some 15 years later and ex-marine and happily married as well as pillar of the community Tom Kubik, James Cavlezel, is on trial for is life for being the point or hit-man in having the peasants murdered! This all doesn't go well with Tom's wife high powered San Francisco lawyer Claire, Ashley Judd, who's sure that he's totally innocent of the charges brought against him. Together with Tom's military assigned lawyer Lt. Terrence Embry, Adam Scott, Claire takes up her husband Tom's defense only to find out that in a military tribune, or trial, the person on trial is guilty as a matter of course just not to make the military look bad in having him beat the charges against him! Even if he's totally innocent!Ashley Judd is very good as the plucky wife and lawyer of the jailed, and put on suicide watch, Tom Kubik who despite all the facts on his side is set to spend the rest of his life behind bars, if not executed, for a crime that he insists that he didn't commit. Things start to go a bit sour for Tom when it's reviled that he's in fact not really Tom Kubik but Ron Chapman an ex-special forces man that he kept from his wife Claire ever since he met and later married her! What really hurts Tom's, or better yet Ron's, case is that all the members of that special forces unit that he was part of swore under oath that he was the one who gunned down those dozen or son helpless Salvadoran peasants!What really turns things around is former military defense lawyer who's now out of circulation, because of his alcohol addiction, the gutsy and sure of himself, in never losing a case, Charley Grimes played to perfection by actor Morgan Freeman. Knowing how the system works Charley dances rings around the military prosecutors making them look like a bunch of dummies in how incompetent they really are. Charley, as well as Claire, also pay for their successful defense of Tom by getting the hell beat out of them by hired tugs or off duty Marines for making a monkey out of beloved and respected US Marine Brig. General Bill Marks, Bruce Davidson. It was Gen. Marks who in fact ordered the the attack on the Salvadoran village that Tom is now standing trial for.***MAJOR SPOILERS***Don't read if you didn't already see the movie. Charley getting himself smashed and on a bender, after being on the wagon for 482 days, by drinking himself almost blind seems far more effective now then when he was plain stone sober when he took up Tom's case. Just when things started to turn in Tom's favor Charley unearthed a number of bodies, down Mexico way, that in fact proved that he wasn't exactly the innocent lamb that he always claimed to be. Working against the clock Charley tries to get in touch with Calire to warn her what a sick and dangerous man her sweet and loving husband Tom really is. The trouble is that Tom now a free man is in the position, with an anxious Charley in far off Mexico, to put an end to any speculations about himself that his naive wife Claire may learn about him in the future. In that with Tom now on the lose a future is the very last thing that Calire can look forward too!

I've never been the biggest Ashley Judd fan, and the rest of the acting was so-so. But as always, Morgan Freeman delivers and makes this a MUCH better movie than it should have been, even though I'm still giving it a five. I think that goes to show how utterly abysmal this film would have been.First off, the film advertises a big shocking twist, but I had concluded what it was before the movie has even half over, and it was entirely predictable from that point. But even with me knowing what the twist was put aside, the story failed to grip me, and the movie seemed much too slow paced for my taste.Like I said, Freeman did a superb job in this movie like he always does, but if you, like me, are a fan of his work, there are tons of other movies where he also did even better like Shawshank Redemption, Wanted, or others. Skip this one.

Kubik) plays a lawyer who lives a happy life with her husband (Mr. Kubik) who is a soldier. One day he is arrested and accused of killing nine innocent people during a military operation in El Salvador.She is convinced of his innocence and decides to get involved in his defense. As she doesn't know the military - and it's laws she teams up with another lawyer - played by Morgan Freeman (Mr. Grimes).Ashleys husband claims that he is innocent and points his accusing finger in the direction of a very mean looking soldier, who was on that military operation. His name is Hernandez and he attends the trial.Morgan as well as Ashley get attacked several times during the trial and this strongly suggests that sinister forces are at work with the intend of having the two giving up defending Mr. Kubik. Further it is suggested that it is the military who is using Mr. Kubik as a scapegoat.All of a sudden the trial ends as the Ministry of Defence drops their charges. Then the false epilogue can start - everybody knows that the movie hasn't reached it's climax and it doesn't take an Einstein to figure out what will happen.To summon up (spoiler); Mr. Kubik is brought down because 1) he has an electronic calendar that links him with some of the killings and 2) he admits to Mrs. Kubik that he actually killed those nine innocent people and then afterward killed the witnesses!? If you had committed some murders wouldn't you erase all clues you could think of that would connect you - including your calendar? This is a man who is supposed to be a specialist in killing and being deceitful (he can cheat the polygraph) and yet he tells his wife the truth knowing that he then must either kill her or go to prison (can't remember if the death penalty was an option).When he at last has been terminated there is no reflection whatsoever on whether justice has been served. He killed those innocent people - but wasn't he acting on somebody's orders...? Justice has been served then in the exact same way as in the case of reservist Lynndie England who stood trial and was convicted of torturing prisoners in the Abu Ghraib prison. She got convicted but not her superiors.The scene, where Mrs. Kubik and Mr. Grimes drives into a river because somebody spills oil on their car and on the road apparently didn't lead to a thing.All in all I can't recommend this movie - the story wont make much sense if you pause just once and think it through.Regards Simon "},{"Title":"highly satisfying","Date":"31 March 2009","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" A yuppie lawyer and her puppy husband get into trouble with the murderous military.

I for one found the end a little surprising and it's lines were well written and witty and the acting is top notch as Judd and Freeman blaze the screen up with their great chemistry. And Peet and Caviezel give good supporting performances. Taking place in the city by the bay San Francisco, California Ashley Judd stars as Claire Kubik a powerful defense attorney who enjoys her life with husband Tom(James Caviezel)until all of a sudden it explodes when the FBI charges him with the murder of innocent people that supposedly happened during a covert operation fifteen years earlier. And this is where the intrigue and suspense begins when the info is dished out is Tom really Tom? is it a government cover up? Enter now the help of a down on his luck lawyer Charles Grimes(Morgan Freeman)who uses his crafty and dirty work investigative techniques to uncover the truth and find out the real mystery. Careers and well being are on line to find the truth. Sexy Amanda Peet is good as Jackie the free spirited and care free polar opposite sister of Claire. Peet's Jackie character is even tied up and has her mouth taped shut with duct tape during a home invasion scene of Claire's house when an intruder tries to get his message out to stay away from the case as the military has a cover up and it's trying to hide the truth. Overall good film that's watchable many times clearly a good suspense and intriguing drama that you will enjoy it's edge of the seat danger and feel relieved in the end when the truth is revealed.
