At first its subjects seem simple, but like many people do, these characters are merely shielding themselves, hesitant to reveal much of their real natures except as as rare gifts in intimate moments. It must have been tremendously challenging to create and portray natural introverts like these characters, but as an introvert myself (I assert that characteristic without any touch of self-disparagement), I found this story rewardingly resonant of my own experience, especially of childhood memories, although indeed my outward circumstances had little in common with this story.Almost never has any film conveyed a sense and feeling of a few small places so clearly and so effortlessly. We cherished the village in Local Hero, but Fingerbone is an incomparably more realistic and deftly drawn place (despite occasional overreaching, e.g., the town's name, and a train accident that stretches credulity in more than one way).For anyone willing to watch, dusk and the blue pre-dawn illuminate and suffuse these characters' lives. Sylvie sits by herself in the dark, but there are wonderful secrets to discover in places that seem a void to others. Even well-meaning intrusions, like interruptions to meditation, can seem tragic.Even more distinctly than Forsyth's other work, this film certainly wouldn't appeal to everyone, but it is a beautiful and evocative character study that has the courage to deal with personalities, events and emotions too obscure or inaccessible for most mainstream filmmakers.  Forsyth deserves credit for having gotten this made in the first place, as well as for the eclectic perception that gave the film its many unique and worthwhile qualities.

I love Local Hero but I think this is Bill Forsyth's masterpiece so far. It is about conformity, parenting, coming of age, making choices, madness, creativity, adulthood, tragedies that every family endures, riding on trains, family traits and how they are passed down,living in a small town, life, death, boy scouts doing their good deed for the day, the many uses of newsprint ... the list goes on and on. In short, it is about everything and works at many levels, as a Great Film should. And this is a Truly Great Film, high on my top ten list of favorite films of all time. It is perfectly written, directed and filmed by Bill Forsyth of Scotland, and it includes a great performance by Christine Lahti and also by the supporting cast (esp. those who play her nieces). There is not a bad note in this film, it is a perfect film in every way, to my eye.I understand why some commentators give this film a low rating -- they came looking for a comedy, or for the light melancholia of Local Hero (also a wonderful movie and one of my favorites). Housekeeping is dark melancholia, but it is also deeper and richer of a brew -- kind of Bergman with a sense of humor, in its vibe (though not its plot) it reminds me of another coming of age film, To Kill a Mockingbird, and it is of that film's high caliber.This film is woefully under-appreciated in the U.S., I hope it is released on DVD soon. It deserves another chance to be recognized for what it is -- one of the greatest films of a generation. And I so hope that Bill Forsyth, still relatively young in his early sixties, gets back to writing and directing. His films are wonderful but too few. I really want to -- NEED to -- hear more from Mr. Forsyth, I feel his absence deeply, it is as if Yo-Yo Ma or Heifitz put away their fiddles after a few great concerts, and played no more.

The film was sold as another of Bill Forsythe's whimsical comedies, but the humor is overshadowed by the lingering memory of loss and dissatisfaction a grandfather's tragic death, a mother's lonely suicide, and so forth. Likewise there isn't anything funny about Aunt Sylvie's deeply rooted vagabond instincts (expressed, for once, as something more than merely charming or quaint), which attract the more introverted sister (narrating the details) as strongly as they repel the rest of the community. It's a haunting, almost melancholy film, carefully paced to the rhythms of small town life in hard times, and with a fascinating undercurrent (note the irony of the title) equating the freedom of the open road with the liberation of women from domestic dependency.

Needless to say, I didn't catch all of the details in the opening minutes, but I was quickly drawn in by the subdued characters, the scenery, and the quietness.  I was completely absorbed for the remainder of the film, primarily due to the excellent acting by the girls and especially Christine Lahti.  **SLIGHT SPOILER ALERT** I loved the way you could watch the sisters begin to separate - one sticking to home and the other seeking out acceptance and, well, life.  However there weren't any stereotypical girl fights.  Lucille didn't humiliate Ruth in front of her new friends, Ruth didn't retreat 100%... It struck me as being more realistic than what most movies portray in terms of girlfriends/sisters needing to go their own ways.As for Christine Lahti...wow.  I really like her anyway and wish she did more movies of quality.  She can even make a crappy Lifetime movie watchable!  She was so subtle and perfect.  Movies generally portray the mentally ill (debateable term!) as extremists, but not here.  There's never that middle ground where so many ordinary people drift along in. There is never any completely bizarre, crazy, off-the wall behavior here and I bet most people have known someone just like her.  Someone who is able to function, but can be distracted by very strong, yet invisible or abstract forces.  Lahti's character clearly understands she doesn't *fit,* which is especially clear when she is speaking with the church women or the police officer, but she never goes off on some tangent about how it's them, not her or whatever.  She's like so many people who, for one moment you can connect with them and have a conversation, and the next you want to grab their shoulders and shake them because they are off in some other place.Sure, this movie has its flaws, but is still very enjoyable and interesting.

There is a mystery behind Sylvie's smile, behind her strange for the most population of the small town behavior - she collects empty tin cans and used newspapers, she loves to walk alone and to visit train station and a nearby mountain lake. Christine Lahti is the center of the movie as a lonely gentle woman who has lived through many disappointments and failures it seems and learned how to choose what is really important for her and not to pay attention what anyone would think of her. It is easier to live this way but Sylvie will have to learn how to get closer, to connect, and to love again.

There are gentle kindness, quiet sadness, the spirit of freedom and adventure, unspoken words, bitter disappointments, failures, search for love, for understanding and belonging in this movie. Christine Lahti is great - watching her reminded me of two remarkable movies, Running On Empty where Lahti played one of the main characters, the mother and wife in the family that had to be on the run and the devastating and profoundly moving Vagabond by Agnes Varda, the tragic search for absolute freedom.

When I first saw the film, I had to shake myself out of the notion that Sylvie was a neglectful parent and take her as more of a device.  At first the film, for me, was about loss and our reactions to it - the train's disappearance into the lake, so close and yet gone, the mother's disappearance in like fashion.  15 years later I think more about our reaction to the future.  Whatever.  Sylvie isn't a mad woman for us to tut-tut about, she's a mad woman who brings alive what the townspeople and especially the girls feel about what's beyond us, about where others have gone and how we just don't know about it.  She slips over the boundaries and back again, seeing phantom families of ten kids in impossible dilapidated frosty cabins, enjoying the monstrous rushing of the train as it shakes the trestle over her head, singing into the night in a leaky boat (Christine Lahti's singing, though brief, is one reason to enjoy this movie).  Sylvie's more happily arbitrary than we are.  We're not really less arbitrary, just more habitual so that we can be blindered to the unknown.  For pointing that out, she's scary.  It's easier to blame her rather than the scariness she points to.  In the book, Ruth also sees past the usual boundaries and is fascinated with the possibilities just out of grasp, as if they were in the lake that memorably slips its boundaries.My apologies for misspelling Marilynne Robinson's name in the last post.

Most puzzling is the strangely under-developed script. To the exclusion of almost everything else, the film focuses on three characters (Aunt Sylvie and nieces Ruth and Lucille), and on the time when the action unfolds. Interaction with other characters is minimal, but more importantly, no depth or roundness is given to the leads by dialogue that would reveal something about their characters or fill in something of their back-story. We are left utterly in the dark as to the motivation for the apparently light-hearted suicide of the young girls' mother, Helen (this isn't a spoiler, by the way - it's how the film opens), and we learn nothing more about her during the film that would shed any light on the question. Similarly, we can discern (though it is never openly stated) that Sylvie has spent a lot of time hoboing, but the question of how this came about, and whether it was the cause or effect (or entirely unrelated to) the breakdown of her marriage, is never broached. Her husband, and Helen's husband (the girls' father), are also blank holes in the story, despatched with in one line of Sylvie's dialogue each. We learn absolutely nothing about Sylvie's relationship with her sister Helen, or with their parents. Most centrally, Ruth's almost complete lack of motivation in any direction (responding to every question with I don't know or I suppose so) means that, dramatically speaking, the film has a blank at its centre. All this makes it pretty hard to sustain an interest in the film for two hours.This basic structural weakness of the script gives the film a flat, two-dimensional, untextured quality. The building-up of a sense of character through the amassing of information about them, and of a sense of place by the accretion of small details, are (with the exception of the much dwelt-on railway bridge) completely missing. These are things Forsyth certainly knows how to do - Gregory's Girl and Comfort and Joy both do them, delightfully, from beginning to end - which makes his involvement here all the harder to fathom.A fine performance from Christine Lahti, given the pretty thin material she had to work with. A minor quibble about the sound with dialogue recorded on set and (as far as I could tell) no studio re-recording, some of the non-professional cast's mumbling delivery of the lines is hard to make out.

It's was so amazingly different from anything I'd ever seen before or since. It felt powerfully unique and special to me, and what it was about was very quaint, no fantastical elements whatsoever, only the endlessly fascinating eccentricities of people. Well a little more so, in this case. It struck a real deep chord with me and felt very much like a type of story that had never been told the same way in anything else. There's a melancholy windblown kind of feeling to it that would probably come off as dull and dreary if the film didn't happen to be so utterly charming and brilliantly captivating in its own understated simplicity. I found the situations, story, and really the overall world of the movie to be very enchanting in-and-of itself, it felt very authentic and starkly real. And although a lot of the tone is strange, contemplative and even surreal at moments, I still found all the characters to be always believable and I had a lot of sympathy for all sides involved in what was going on. I really followed those characters closely and wished them all well. I thought it was simple yet ingenious how the story was set up and played out, with the two sisters being so close at first and then gradually growing apart and eventually becoming estranged to the point of them practically being strangers as the youngest of the two, Lucille, becomes ashamed of her own sister and rejects the plain existential life that she seems content to live, and who eventually leaves after she adopts herself to a school teacher, whereas the gangly and socially-awkward Ruth finds a true kindred spirit in her aunt and the two grow ever-closer and more isolated from the real world, which I found a little unsettling.. One of the things I loved about this movie was how it makes you think about and question the morals of the story, and how whether or not it was right or not for Ruth to be with Sylvie was very much a matter of perspective and entirely up to the viewer. To me the main theme of it seemed to be that of the differences between those who desire to be a part of things and those wandering souls who appear to derive more satisfaction from being apart and and being their own person no matter the consequences. And there was such an uncanny strangeness in the patterns of the 'madness' passed down from generation to generation, like the eerie story of the doomed train that was swallowed up by the icy lake in the dead of night, and how that was similar to the film's startling opening scene where the girls' mother calmly drives her car into the same waters. Christine Lahti gave such a phenomenal performance, I found her gentle character so fascinating, how she was extremely eccentric to the point where some may have been in their right to consider her mentally disturbed, yet she was completely sincere and lucid all at once. I loved how she used her eccentric view of things to make miserable and scary situations seem like whimsical games, to herself and to the girls. Perhaps as a subconscious way of dealing with the daunting obstacles. One of my favourite parts is when they visit the forsaken-looking wreck of an old cabin on a lonely frost-covered island and it looks like a very saddening place to be, but she makes it seem like such a magical dreamlike place. You really do get people like Sylvie in the world, the ones who despite themselves are just too damn odd to ever truly fit into the regular scheme of things, and that's okay, that's just the way it is sometimes. Some people are meant to be with others, and some are just different and for the most part prefer to be alone and don't care about fitting in. And I believe they do it because they have to, not want to, it's their nature. And I don't think it really matters where any of us lives, as long as we live well in ourselves. I was so engrossed all the way through to the final scene which had me in tears the first time I saw it, because it was just so moving. There was something so powerfully emotive and poignant about the visuals of it with the two figures running along the wooden train tracks until they eventually vanish into the night... It was very sad and haunting, but also kind of beautiful and uplifting at the same time, and it concluded the movie in the absolute perfect way. This is a lovably strange and exquisitely bittersweet gem of a picture. It's sad, soulful, thought-provoking, and very precious and I love it very much. I never saw such a thing!

His movies tend to focus on low-key characters and obscure places rarely seen in filmdom. Local Hero is one of my all-time favorites. I now add Housekeeping to the list.The movie is adapted from a novel by Marilynne Robinson. It takes place in the tiny town of Fingerbone, located in the Cascade Mountains of what I assume is Eastern Washington or Idaho, given many references to Spokane and Portland. I have lived in Seattle for many years, and I adore the scenery featured in this movie. One can almost smell the pungent, bracing aroma of decaying logs, fir trees, and smoldering campfires in the outdoor scenes.Christine Lahti is an actress of rare gifts. Her basic decency and warmth comes through in every film I have seen her in. She plays rootless Sylvie, who comes to be the guardian of two adolescent orphaned nieces, Ruthie and Lucille. The story takes place in the 1950s, and the fashions, cars, and social mores are all dead-on. She and the girls live in a large house on the outskirts of Fingerbone, the same home Sylvie and her deceased sister Helen grew up in. The story explores the relationships of these three women, and the shifting dynamics of those relationships. There is an implied parallel of Ruthie and Lucille with Sylvie and Helen. Housekeeping supplies a rich family history for these off-beat characters, and provides a context for their behavior and development.There are very few men in this film. It is resolutely about the lives of women among other women. The story unfolds over several years, and we see how Lucille (the younger sister) comes to be the responsible one, who yearns to live 'like other people'. Sylvie exists in a dream world, and Ruthie is gradually drawn into that land of longing and detachment. Eccentric is how most people would describe the behavior of Sylvie, but I prefer haunted. Haunted by the lingering presence of dead siblings and parents, haunted by the inability to fit in to modern society, haunted by the endless possibilities of other places and times. To me, Housekeeping is a ghost story, but these ghosts yet live.She IS sad. I mean, she should be sad.

Enter Aunt Sylvie (Christine Lahti), who comes to live with them. She is supposed to take care of them, but as Sylvie's many eccentricities pop up, like sleeping on a park bench and lighting candles with rolled-up newspaper, it seems the question is who will care for who. Will anyone?Mislabeled by its marketers as a comedy regarding a woman slightly distracted by the possibilities of life, Housekeeping seems more like a prison story, the prison being one's own family and/or genetic destiny, of being born into a family of chronic outsiders and drifters fated to sad and lonely ends.Sylvie is carefree, yet detached both from her nieces and the rest of the world. Sylvie's behavior was annoying, Ruth tells us in a running narration. Then it became frightening. The different reactions of the sisters to their aunt become the lynchpin of the drama.While Lahti makes an impression and deserves the praise she got, the film's standout performances are those of Walker and Burchill, who inhabit their roles rather than just play them. To the extent Housekeeping develops your sympathy and engagement (for me the first hour does this quite handily) it's from watching these two interact and register as distinct personalities as the story goes on.Otherwise, the film is a bit of a slog, especially in the second half when it focuses on Sylvie and Ruth. Forsyth once said he was less attracted to making a movie than he was an advertisement for reading the Robinson novel. Indeed, the film seems designed to connect with those already familiar with the source material, who don't need to have spelled out such things as why and how Ruth and Sylvie connect, or what happens between Ruth and Lucille. We hear the ends of conversations, watch people walk away from each other, and are left to connect the dots.Long narrations consciously serve to replicate Robinson's evocative prose style over story (Who could tell where the train might come to rest? It might be sliding yet...down and down...) and there is a tendency to linger on secondary elements which works more for a novel than a movie.The house of the title makes for a marvelous set, full of nooks and crannies suggesting the disordered nature of our principals' existence. Michael Coulter's cinematography captures some wondrous visuals, like dawn coming over a mountain lake and a crackling fire at dusk. The film is such a triumph of mood-setting it hurts to see it do so little with its characters or their situation.I can watch 15 minutes of Housekeeping and experience the same kind of pure delight I get watching other Forsyth films, but after that, the pointlessness and heaviness of the situation become a burden. If I read the book, I might feel differently, but I have a feeling Forsyth himself would agree If I read the book, I wouldn't need the movie.

I suppose that it fits the Bill Forsyth criterion of being quirky and different, but it lacks the humour of films like Gregory's Girl and That Sinking Feeling.

I found the film a little too female oriented for my own taste, though it was hard to not get enthralled with Ms Lahti herself in the film. She has this strong presence as though she were a child of some other world on a mission of mercy. She carries off the lead role of Sylvie as though the role had been written for her, though it was apparently written for Diane Keaton, who would have been terrible in it, I can't help thinking. Lahti easily projects a connection with something more substantial and elusive than ordinary existence. And it was a real pleasure to see her stroll on stage afterward barely having aged from playing Sylvie 21 plus years ago. There was a tangible physical effect on every man there, and later I rushed over to snap her photo close range.The movie is about an eccentric aunt who ends up caring for two nieces who have lost their mother at a young age. There's a lack of understanding for her independent ways in the town the story's set in, but the audience has no trouble giving her all the leeway she requires.

The auntis not 'unstable' she is played to perfection by lahti, who is so real in the role it is absolutely scary. she , along with the oldest girl, are in their own world for survival from some extremely crazy tragic events. The flood house scene and railroad tracks and 'girls week off by the lake from school' are classics. The mother's final scenes and scary music interlude haunts forever. This even inspired my trip on a train up to spokane.It shows the eldest girl staring at her shoes, and we think of how much childhood is to lose, and how overwhelming it is , the possibility of a relative losing custody, that we will do anything t o preserve some happiness, childhood ONLY comes once, and the heavy Grey sadness these girls have is unbearable. The neglectful aunt who collects brown old newspapers to the rooftops. all classic showings of those who ride the train rails and what MAKES us hobos.

It's characteristic of the movie's subtlety that the degree of Ruthie's self-determination is never quite clear given the character's extreme undemonstrativeness - the end may represent an (albeit innocent) form of coercion by Lahti. Even if so though, that's still a manifestation of family and of the way structures arise and    endure, and as such seems at peace with the film's river-like tranquility and evocation of old myths (the train that went into the lake; the grandfather's obsession with mountains); the movie is also good at creating present-day images that look like the stuff of FUTURE legend (the flooded house; the night they spend out on the lake). Lahti's clever portrayal (unconventional, almost too honest at times even as she recedes as others) is perfectly suited to embodying the theme of a threat embodied by difference, regardless of its nature. This is surely Forsyth's most accomplished film.

Set in the 1950's, in the Pacific Northwest, after being abandoned by their mother, sisters Ruth (Sara Walker) and Lucille (Andrea Burchill) wind up living with their eccentric aunt Sylvie (Christine Lahti). They get on for quite a while, but eventually Lucille can't take the eccentric lifestyle much longer and moves out, but Ruth sticks with Sylvie, even after a flood spoils quite a bit. The relatives want Ruth to get the best out of life, and life with Sylvie might not be doing her any favours, so Sylvie retorts by wanting to live on the road again, taking Ruth with her. That's about all I could grasp I'll be honest, not that I didn't get it all. Also starring Anne Pitoniak as Aunt Lily, Barbara Reese as Aunt Nona, Bill Smillie as Sheriff, Wayne Robson as Principal, Margot Pinvidic as Helen and Georgie Collins as Grandmother. Walker and Burchill were pretty good as the sisters, but I think the key reason I would watch something like this again is because of the curious but charming scene-stealing performance by Lahti, I suppose it is a must-see book-based comedy drama. Very good! "},{"Title":"Odd, Uninspiring Tale of Mental Illness","Date":"11 April 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  An odd, unsatisfying, dream-like film which many reviewers seem to have taken as a hymn to the wonders of personal freedom and unconventionality, Housekeeping is set in a picturesque, isolated small town in the 1950's, a decade portrayed here in conventional terms of repression and rigidity. The highly praised Christine Lahti plays a free spirit, a sort of female traveling hobo, who arrives to take charge of her orphaned teenage nieces.Many viewers and critics have taken Lahti's character as a sort of inspirational Pied Piper, urging the girls unto self-expression and leading them to seek out the path less traveled by.  In contrast, Lahti struck me as simply (and rather depressingly) mentally ill, exhibiting a lot of classic symptoms (agoraphobia, paranoia, accumulating useless possessions)and selfishly and irresponsibly destroying the life her young charges had established for themselves in the town.  In time, the more level-headed of her nieces rejects Lahti's irrational behavior and, sensibly, leaves to live with one of her school teachers.  Lahti takes cold advantage of her remaining, more emotionally fragile, niece, molding her into a companion and eventually persuading her to run away and embark on an aimless life as a drifter.The film is generally well-acted, contains some strong visual images (the girls' mother committing suicide by driving her sedan into the lake, the flood that engulfs the house) and an evocative feeling of time and place. But at heart, what many saw as a hymn of praise to the wonders of an unfettered, bohemian life, is really just a portrait of a self-absorbed, and rather sad, mental patient. "}{"Title":"One of the worst films ever made.","Date":"13 April 2002","Score":"5 out of 27 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  'A Tidy Comedy'? Anyone who even *smiled* during the screening of this film needs quality psychiatric help.And I say this as a huge fan of Bill Forsyth. I have seen all of his films, and I spent a great deal of effort tracking down this particular one. Having finally found it, I have to say, it's little wonder that it isn't widely available--it is DIRE.Every director makes a few dud movies, but Forsyth's less brilliant films are still very watchable and above average (e.g. Breaking In). This however, is Bill Forsyth's worst film by *two* orders of magnitude--it's hard to believe he even had anything to do with it. It is *entirely* without merit affected cardboard acting; excruciatingly boring, uneventful plot; superfluous, meaningless dialogue... just pointless... *pointless*... a complete waste of time! I cannot berate  this film enough! In fact, the only thing that kept me going throughout this masterpiece of uninspired tedium (it took me about four sittings to watch it all the way through) was the prospect of giving it the richly deserved roasting that I now submit. I cannot believe that Forsyth read the (justly) obscure book upon which this film is based, and thought it would make an interesting (or even bearable) film--and if the film is anything to go by, the book must be absolutely *mind-numbing*.There's no point in giving a detailed intelligent critique of this film--it would be a waste of time. This film is a non-entity. It's like a particularly dull episode of The Waltons, with John Boy's monotonous narrative voice-over replaced by that of the even more robotic Ruthie.It defies belief that all the other reviews of this film are highly positive, the most scathing comment being that it was uninspiring. Uninspiring? Try *soul-destroying*. But the plot was only mildly depressing compared to the actual severe depression induced by the complete viewing experience. I have to admit, I experienced a real sense of uplifting *joy* when finally it was all over.I expect that, to the *insane* reviewers who actually enjoyed this film, the intervention of the town's concerned citizens at the end might be considered the heartless act of interfering busybodies. I only wish that people of a similar ilk had interfered with the making of this  abominable waste of time.Fans of Forsyth avoid like the *Black* Plague.  "}]
