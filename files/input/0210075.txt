Or at least one would think so.  Imagine that in addition to financial instability you are a young Latino woman, with no aspirations, opportunities or positive role models, who does poorly in school, and has a powder keg temper.  Welcome to Diana Guzman's life.Whether it's because she refuses to talk about lipstick and boys or because she settles disagreements with her fists, Diana is an outcast.  After her fourth fight in as many months, the principal informs Diana that she's run out of chances - one more fight and she's gone.  She files the incident under Whatever, and curses about her detention as she heads to a squalid little athletic club on an errand for her father.When Diana walks into the gym, she is entranced by the combination of salty sweat, testosterone, and men boxing.   In keeping with the atmosphere, she decks one of the boxers after he takes a cheap parting shot at her little brother after a bout.  Rather than chastising her, the men edge back, affording her a measure of respect, the first she has ever experienced. And she likes it.  Realizing that she has found her niche all she convince a skeptical, chauvinistic trainer to take her on, get money to pay him, and hide her passion from her abusive, dismissive, alcoholic father.  Well, at least it's no tougher than anything else she's had to do.Anyone expecting a female Rocky will be disappointed - Girlfight is not about endorsements, glory or bone crushing slow motion boxing sequences - boxing here serves as the background for the film, not the main attraction. The film would more appropriately be described as - and I really hate this phrase - a coming of age story.  But Diana is a much more complex than the typical lead in this genre - she struggles not only with the issues we normally associate with adolescence - awkwardness, a desire to belong, and racing hormones - but also with discrimination, blinding rage, and expectations that are constantly forced upon her.  As Diana's training progresses, she grows both literally and as a person -she learns to control her anger, walk with confidence, discover who she is, smile and risk the vulnerability of romance.   The acting is superb.From the initial appearance of her glowering image on screen, Michelle Rodriguez is superb.  Chosen from among several hundred actors at a cattle call, Rodriguez, who had only previously worked as an extra, captures Diana's hostile intensity and indifference perfectly and has a screen presence that most actors would sell a couple of souls for.  In addition to honing Diana's persona, Rodriguez underwent four and a half months of gruelling training to develop the necessary boxing skills and physique to match.  The final product is one of the strongest performances I've seen since Hillary Swank's Oscar winning role in Boys Don't Cry.   Rodriguez is bolstered by a strong cast  Jaime Tirelli,  who plays her Doubting Thomas trainer Hector, and Santiago Douglas, as Adrian, her sensitive partner in love and in the ring.Rather than opt for the clean Hollywood look, Girlfight feels like a documentary both in the locations and filming.  From the dingy little hole in the wall gym plastered with mottoes written on cardboard (Champions are made, not born) to the crumbling deadly projects where Diana lives, everything has that unpolished grit that is difficult to fake.  The director also chose a departure from the accepted standard of choreography in boxing films - instead of the whiplash-in-action slow motion sequences, the sparring is shown from a first person perspective with the glove coming straight at the viewer's face.  I flinched more than once.Take a date, or go alone.  Either way you will agree that Girlfight works on many levels, and disappoints on none.  "},{"Title":"Ever wonder why women want to box?

Although the film is not about boxing, boxing is all about the film. So much so you can almost smell the sweat.

Which is exactly what a young Latino girl does in `Girlfight,' written and directed by Karyn Kusama.  Diana (Michelle Rodriguez) is an eighteen-year-old High School senior from the projects in Brooklyn, facing expulsion after her fourth fight in the halls since the beginning of the semester.  She affects a `whatever' attitude which masks a deep-seated anger that threatens to take her into places she'd rather not go.  She lives with her father, Sandro (Paul Calderon), with whom she has a very tentative relationship, and her younger brother, Tiny (Ray Santiago).  With her life teetering on the brink of dissolution, she desperately needs an outlet through which to channel the demons that plague her. 																						 And one day she finds it, without even looking for it, when she stops by the gym where Tiny trains.  Ironically, Tiny wants nothing to do with boxing; he wants to go to art school, but Sandro is determined that his son should be able to take care of himself on the streets, and pays the ten dollars a week it costs for his lessons.  When Diana convinces Tiny's trainer, Hector (Jaime Tirelli), to take her on, and approaches her father for the money, under the guise of calling it a weekly allowance (she doesn't want him to know what she wants the money for), Sandro turns her down and tells her to go out and earn her own money.  Ultimately, with Tiny's help she finds a way, and the ring soon becomes her second home.  It's an environment to which she readily adapts, and it appears that her life is about to take a turn for the better.  And the fact that she will have to fight men, not women, in `gender blind' competitions, does not faze her in the least.  Diana has found her element.	First time writer/director Karyn Kusama has done a terrific job of creating a realistic setting for her story, presenting an honest portrait of life in the projects and conveying that desperation so familiar to so many young people who find themselves in dead-end situations and on that road that leads to nowhere.  And there's no candy coating on it, either; as Hector tells Diana when she asks him how he came to be where he is, `I was a fighter once.  I lost.'  Then, looking around the busy gym, `Like most of these guys, they're going to lose, too.  But it's all they know--'  And it's that honesty of attitude, as well as the way in which the characters are portrayed, that makes this movie as good as it is.  It's a bleak world, underscored by the dimly lit, run-down gym-- you can fairly smell the sweat of the boxers-- and that sense of desolation that hangs over it all like a pall, blanketing these people who are grasping and hanging on to the one and only thing they have, all that they know.	Making her screen debut, Michelle Rodriguez is perfectly cast as Diana, infusing her with a depth and brooding intensity that fairly radiates off of her in waves.  She is so real that it makes you wonder how much of it is really Rodriguez; exactly where does the actor leave off and the character begin?  Whatever it is, it works.  It's a powerful, memorable performance, by an actor from whom we will await another endeavor with great anticipation.  She certainly makes Diana a positive role model, one in whom many hopefully will find inspiration and the realization that there are alternative paths available in life, at least to those who would seek them out.	As positive as this film is, however, it ends on something of an ambiguous note; though Diana obviously has her feet on the ground, there's no indication of where she's headed.  Is this a short term fix for her, or is she destined to become the female counterpart of Hector?  After all, realistically (and in light of the fact that the realism is one of the strengths of this film), professional boxing isn't exactly a profession that lends itself to, nor opens it's arms to women.  And in keeping with the subject matter of the film, and the approach of the filmmaker, an affirmation of the results of Diana's assertiveness would have been appropriate.	The supporting cast includes Santiago Douglas (Adrian), Elisa Bocanegra (Marisol), Alicia Ashley (Ricki) and Thomas Barbour (Ira).  Though it delivers a very real picture of life to which many will be able to identify, there are certain aspects of `Girlfight,' that stretch credibility a bit, regarding some of what happens in the ring.  That aside, it's a positive film that for the most part is a satisfying experience.  I rate this one 7/10.

Just recently I saw her Girlfight which was the role that started and has so far  highlighted her career.  And to be honest I found it to be one of the best movies I have  seen in the last couple years.The movie is about a girl named Diana played by rodriguez who has alot of pent up  anger about herself and her mother's death.  So her life at school is spent mostly by  getting into fights, but that all changes when she visits her brother at a local boxing  facility.  Soon its her and not her brother being the one trained, and through boxing she finds a  way to release her anger, and find something to concentrate on.  One of the things I  found that I loved about the movie was that at the end not all of her problems were  taken care of, just some of them.  And her dreams are not realized but just taken a step  further which is all she really wants.  But most of all it was Michelle's performance that made this movie the experience it is. Her character is REAL, and people aspiring to be actresses should watch her movie for  pointers.  She imbues her with the rage, and the full range of emotions that she shows  through every scene.

But this film is different.  It uses it's independent edge (it won numerous awards at the Sundance and Caanes film festivals) to not be cornball, but to a good achievement.  Michelle Rodriguez definately makes an credible debut as the troubled and always angry Diana, who decides a way to get out some of her aggression is in boxing, and it works, even when she has to face her boyfriend in the (improbable to be sure) ring.  Better than I thought, but the liability is that Diana is always angry (so angry that any regular girl's worst day of PMS is Diana's best day) and she does some things to her family and friends that are very questionable, method and emotion wise which almost makes her not the best girl to emmulate.

It's an Indie; low-budget, no big-name actors, freshman director. I had heard it was good, but not this good.Placed in a contemporary, ethnic, working-class Brooklyn, Karyn Kusama has done an extraordinary job of capturing the day-do-day struggles of urban Latinos.  Diana, the protagonist, is seething with anger and lashes out at her high school peers, getting in trouble with the school and her friends. She is being raised by her single father, who appears to love her and her brother, but applies a strict, sex-based double standard on his children. The father's double standard is illustrated by the fact that Tiny, the brother, is taking boxing lessons at the local gym, but Diana is denied similar pursuits. On an errand to the gym to meet Tiny, Diana is captivated by boxing. Tiny doesn't like boxing, so he and Diana trade places; he gets the money from Dad then gives it to Diana to take the lessons in his place.This is actually a feel-good movie, as Diana grows and learns about herself through boxing, meets a guy, and addresses some very serious issues head-on. There's no giggly, 'everything that can go right does go right' resolution a la Bend It Like Beckham. The reality and attendant personal issues are too big for pat resolutions, but in my opinion, Girlfight is a better and more satisfying film for it.

Knowing her father will never let her do it she steals the money from him and starts to train with Hector. Quickly improving in the ring despite the hoots of derision aimed at her from her fellow boxers, Diana finds problems with a lack of female opposition, love in the shape of another up and coming amateur and a conflict on the horizon with her father bound to find out sooner or later.I'm not sure where I got the idea but for years I had the impression that this was a foreign indie film that had made a big impression and was critically praised. Mostly for these reasons I did really want to see it but never got round to it until it came onto television recently. By this point I had realized that it was an American movie with some indie aspirations but not the grit or adult content I had expected &#150; anyway, this preconception was my fault so I put it out of my mind and settled to watch it. The story is a fairly straightforward tale of a teenage girl trying to cut an unusual path in her life, facing and overcoming obstacles along the way. In this regard it is all pretty standard stuff, although the boxing content made it more interesting for me. It is reasonably well written and brings in some themes of domestic violence, back story and so on, without ever really getting to grips with any of them that well.However what makes the film much better than it could have been was the realistic, convincing and moody playing of newcomer (at the time) Michelle Rodriguez. At times she pushes it a bit too close to being a typical whatever teenager and loses our interest but for the most part we can see real heart in her character and she keeps us onside with just enough of a look inside her to keep caring. The direction is also good &#150; matching Rodriguez down-to-earth performance by not playing up the boxing scenes or any other aspect of Diana's life. Support is good from Tirelli, Calderon, Douglas and Santiago to name a few and they hold the ground well for Rodriguez to stand out.Overall this is not a great film, it is an enjoyable one but it rarely is more than par for the course in many areas. The script is OK but doesn't expand very well on the things it hints at, while the boxing scenes never get that exciting (although perhaps this is a strength). What makes it better than the sum of its parts though is a strong performance from Rodriguez delivering a down to earth performance that manages to be defensive and vulnerable at the same time, matched by a gritty tone to the direction throughout. Flawed and nothing special but its good points are enough to make it worth seeing.

She's perfect. Her acting inexperience actually works in her favor. We've never seen her before so it really feels like her story. She also brings across genuine toughness. This works against her though, because we never doubt her. You never have to cheer for her to win because she never goes up against any fighter we don't think she can beat. So as a boxing movie, it fails.Then again, this isn't really a boxing movie. How do you make a movie about a girl who wants to be a boxer that isn't a boxing movie? You don't. But Karyn Kusama has anyway. Like many indie films, Girlfight defies classification or genre and stands on its own as folklore that could darn near happen in real life.Diana is doing poorly in school. She beats up people she doesn't like (all the other girls in her school for example). She doesn't fit in. Her father is forcing her kid brother Tiny to learn to box so he can defend himself when things get tough. He gives Tiny money for his boxing sessions and gives Diana nothing, as if she has no need to defend herself, nor anything worthwhile to make of her life. Tiny wants to go to art school (cliche', yuck), so he gives up his boxing allowance to Diana, who actually wants to box. Things get complicated when Diana falls for another boxer, Adrian (Santiago Douglas), who's looking to turn pro. From there the story winds down toward the inevitable...the two meet in the amateur title fight.What left me cold was that I never found any of this all that interesting. It's all just a bit too believable. Kids with tough lives growing up in rough urban areas fall back on sports. A lot of professional boxers have risen from these circumstances. The mental and physical toughness this upbringing requires lends itself to a game like boxing, where anger is your friend. So this time it's a girl. Big deal.Or there's another position to take finally, a boxing movie about a girl. Women's boxing has been around a long time. The brutality we usually see in boxing films is replaced here by discussions of people's their lives and their feelings. The whole fighting thing is used as a platform from which to paint a larger picture. Respect. Overcoming adversity. Self-discovery.I recommend Girlfight because it has a good spirit and is an example of some great work by a first time director. The dialogue never rises above soap opera quality, but the story itself actually changed my view on some things. Yes, the world now seems like a better place.

Rodriguez puts in a solid performance as a tom-boy with anger problems. The movie uses numerous clichés that mark boxing movies - dysfunctional family, dingy gym, grizzled boxing coach and old-timers, kids trying to pull themselves out of the gutter through a potential career in boxing. But they are used well to provide a good thematic structure.I can't state with any conviction whether the Rodriguez character would've won the final ring-fight with her boyfriend as she did, simply because of the weight and level of training differences, but even so every fight scene (especially the one with her fighting another female contender) was solid and believable, not full of the the melodrama witnessed in the Rocky series.Being a kickboxer myself, I found this movie inspiring and an honest glimpse into a little of the boxing world. It is peopled with gritty, yet honest characters and shows snatches of insight into the reality of boxing - namely, power and dexterity are nothing without the endurance and stamina to match. The shadow-boxing was genuine and heartfelt. Anybody with a contact-sport background identifies with the scenes where she spars with opponents struggling with their own inner demons.The romantic subplot is slightly unrealistic. Even so, the final fight, where they both grapple each other shows a curious mixture of toughness and tenderness. Perhaps a little far-fetched, but it was an interesting juxtaposition.A likable movie, probably marred at the time by all the hyped feminist-trappings rather than allowing the movie to stand on its own merits.

Training is hard and laboring, but the girl is determined to pull through. Love also comes knocking on her door as she falls in love with a fellow boxer at the gym, but the way to the top is not easy.What made this movie work out, was the atmosphere during the training scenes and the atmosphere in the boxing gym. Plus the performances put on by Michelle Rodriguez and Jaime Tirelli, as they really carried the movie nicely.There is a fair amount of late teenage stuff in the movie, which may or may not be suitable just for anyone. And some might certainly think that it is slowing the movie down, and I believe that would be those who come to watch this movie for the boxing scenes. (Which I initially did in the beginning.) For a first movie appearance, then Michelle Rodriguez really pulled it off nicely here and establishes her characteristic face on the map.I went into this movie with one expectation, but the movie turned that around and made me walk away with something else entirely.

Santiago Douglas is a a handsome young man, barely older than she, who also trains there. They meet after class, so to speak, and feel attracted to each other. No sex. Santiago has been instructed to save it for his next bout.Both are participants in a gender-blind athletic program that makes no distinctions between males and females, a misguided attempt to level the athletic playing field.A conservative radio commentator recently announced -- and I swear I'm not making this up -- Let's face it; the president is black. I'm here to make an equally perspicacious observation -- Men and women are different. Now, in 99 cases out of 100, this needn't make any difference in physical performance. But in the top one percent -- trained athletes whose skills have been honed to a fine edge -- men generally have the advantage. With their narrow hips they can run faster. And they have greater muscle mass and upper torso strength. These differences in body build make it possible for women to give birth and raise children and for men to catch and kill food for them. This sexual bifurcation is the result of the perfectly normal process of natural selection. Without it, there might not be any humans at all. And that, boys and girls, is why they have men's events and women's events at the Olympics. I speak to you as your anthropologist. That will be ten cents, PayPal preferred.That's why I called this gender-blind program misguided. As talented a boxer as Rodrigues is, as she approaches the zenith of the game, she will eventually lose to a male.That's where the complication arises in this movie. Rodrigues is finally matched against her boy friend, Douglas. Neither wants to loose any anger on the other, not to mention roundhouse rights, but the pride of both is at stake, and the pride is both personal and gender related. Douglas refuses to fight a woman in the ring. And Rodriguez is offended by what she sees as his patronizing attitude. It ends happily.I wasn't really expecting much from the film. I thought it would be a rip off of Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby until I discovered that this was released years earlier. And I'd never heard of the director or of any of the performers. That sort of obscurity generally augers ill -- made-for-television weepers and so forth.But I was surprised at how neatly this is put together. The total absence of bathos left me open mouthed. So did the minimal use of boxing clichés -- the frayed ropes, the blood, the cutting of the swollen eye, the battered post-bout faces, the fat and sweaty onlooker shouting Kill him!, the slow motion landing of glove on nose, the spray of sweat from the mauled head, the heroic music signaling the long-awaited apotheosis of the victor. None of that here -- well, almost none. The whole plot could be considered formulaic. Tough kid finds outlet in the ring, etc.The feeling you're left with is that this is probably pretty much what these amateur contests are like. Different from those we see on TV and in ordinary movies. No bells ring, for instance, Instead a dancing and observant referee yells Stop! And Box! The contestants wear head gear. The gym is populated not by a crowd of cheering spectators, but only by a handful of people who have some particular interest in the goings on. It's a clean movie, despite the rather grim setting and the unhappy family dynamics.Michelle Rodriguez can look pretty mean, what with her muscular bulk and her eyes glowing under her lowered brow, but once you get used to the idea that this is a girl who can beat you to a pulp anytime she wants, and once you hear the feminine contours of her supersegmentals, she ain't bad. (A scene in which she battles her father to the floor is overdoing it.) It was a little hard to understand Douglas's restraint when Rodriguez crawls all over him in bed. The director, Karyn Kusama, has chosen her talent carefully.Shows what you can do with some talent, imagination, and a modicum of money. There ought to be more films like it. Take one of those multi-billion dollar blockbusters full of dinosaurs or space ships and spread the generosity around a little.

It parallels Billy Elliot, in that the child wants to be just the opposite of what the father thinks he or she should be. Here newcomer Michelle Rodriguez plays Diana, a high school girl in NYC who has a short temper and pretty near zero relationship skills.  Fighting is her usual m.o. and she is near being expelled from school. Later we find out her mother had killed herself, and Diana blames her dad for driving her to that point, thus may be supposed to be the source of her anger.Once her dad asks, Why don't you ever wear a dress? She visits the gym where her younger brother Tiny is training, and is fascinated by the art of boxing. She asks for training and at first is laughed off, but eventually begins to steal her father's money to pay the $10 per lesson. After that is exposed, her brother, who really isn't cut out for boxing, begins to use his boxing allowance to let her continue.Boxing gets her to get in shape, to learn to stick to something, to eventually control her anger and develop relationship skills. In the process, she becomes a pretty good boxer, even beating the guys in her weight class, including her boyfriend, Adrian. And this becomes a wake-up call too him, as he realizes he may not be professional fighter material. The movie ends with a good scene between Diana and Adrian, they are hugging, and she opens her eyes, staring out, perhaps at her future. The director explains this well in the optional commentary track on the DVD. Girlfight isn't a great film. Some of the dialog is pretty plain. Too often kissing is substituted for digging into the real issues of what makes a relationship good or just ordinary. But first-time actress Rodriguez is great in this role, believable as a tough girl, and at the same time believable as an attractive young woman. The film kept my interest 100% of the time, and for me that translates into a good movie. The DVD extras are Spartan, the only worthwhile one being the selectable director's commentary track, which I found very interesting. For example, many actors were real boxing referees, including the strange-looking fellow who sang the National Anthem a capella.

Instead, it just sits there, all good intentions, decent performances, a sweet love story, and nothing to get you excited.The movie isn't lighting any art house boxoffice fires.  When I first heard that, I was surprised.  Now that I've seen it, I'm not.  There's nothing PATENTLY WRONG about the movie (like terrible performances, misguided humor, or abominable plot twists), there's just nothing to get behind.  I had already started to forget the movie when the credits started to roll.  I miss the days when indie USUALLY meant quality, because there were so few RELEASED, that they usually were the cream of the crop.  Now there's just as much average and bad indies as studio films.

Is everyone aware that there really are women prize-fighters, some of whom really are capable of beating the crap out of most men?  What's so improbable about the final boy-girl match isn't that the girl wins, but that it's her boyfriend she has to fight.  And the only feminist thing about the movie is that the women's movement is probably what made it possible to write it as a drama instead of as a comedy.

Girlfight would have been decent if it showed the girl just struggling at this not so simple sport to master but producer Kayrn Kusuma makes it that our heroine becomes so good at it that she is mixing it up with trained male boxers at the gym she trains at and beats them easily!She has a fight between her boyfriend of all people and is fighting toe to toe with him as if she was Roy Jones.The film,you see,is really a feminist dream of going after the big nasty male and beating him at his own game.The film,really,has little to do about a mean girl finding self esteem,something the main character would have done in any other venture,but really about a feminist(Kusuma)playing out a fantasy on film and getting away with it.  This film seems to be the opposite of the British film Billy Elliot.In Billy Elliot a boy is pressuered by his father to become a boxer,but decides to become a dancer instead.In Girlfight a girl is pressured by her father to become a dancer ,but decides to become a boxer instead.Sadly that is how the liberal elites like it,that a boy lose a can lose a chance at manhood and become a sissy and a girl can hate being a woman and become a thug instead.The elites hate masculinity especially if men show it on screen and love it when women show it especially on screen.No wonder both of these films were liked by film critics they way were,they fit the mold.  When it comes to making films about boxing they should make films about real boxing heroes like Roy Jones and Felix Trinidad.I like Michelle Rodriguez,she is a fine actress and real cute.She has the looks of a winner even if Girlfight doesn't.

Diana lives with her brother and single dad, Sandro, in a housing project in Red Hook. Each week Sandro pays a local trainer to put some meat and muscle on his son, but when Diana decides she, too, wants to be a boxer, he refuses. With dogged determination, Diana begins a grueling training regimen, the discipline, cunning, and humility required to be a contender are the cold shower Diana needs to focus her ambitions. But when she falls in love with a promising amateur, her priorities are forced into burning focus...it looks like a good plot, but here is when the movie looses me for a movie about a female boxing there's not much of that, she spends the majority of the movie fighting men,there is a sole fight against another female witch is done pretty well it capture exactly what should look like when two people are boxing,but after that she only goes against men.surprisingly in this world which Kusama tries to give a real perspective of what is boxing in the shoes of a woman,decides to create a inter gender tournament because its so hard to find opponent's in a city like New York, were Diana and her love interest face one another,mixed boxing which is not sanctioned by any legitimate governing body, and are almost always intended to be a display in erotic exhibitionism.If the intention was to see how a woman can beat a man by sheer determination It never goes well in combat, because the man is in a no win situation on one hand he beats a woman which our society sees it as the outcome of the contest in the other hand he looses to the women he is seen as a weakling, besides we only see Diana train a few months and have ONE amateur sanction bout in the hole movie against the only female fighter in the movie and her love interest as been fighting for alonger period so in terms of skill and experience its more likely he would whip the floor with her.Do all female boxers have to best men to prove their equal? or they can show as great athlete's by besting themselves.The ending is very unrealistic for the simple fact that this type of tournament would exist and be sanctioned by the state of New York, had this movie been set in a state were only football is the only sport would make a more interesting scenario were the lack of support and opponents is more visible but NY is the cradle of the golden gloves.

The best are the those which focus less on the sport and more on the character, such as Raging Bull, the Wrestler and Girlfight. This is a great directorial debut for Karyn Kusama, and an outstanding first performance for Michelle Rodriguez. The plot is strait forward enough. Diana Guzman, is in her fourth year of high school, but due to her picking fights in the hallway, she is close to expulsion. As a possible means of unleashing her anger, she signs up for boxing lessons at the club where her brother is training (at the wishes of their father).In the course of ninety minutes, we the viewers see something extraordinary. Diana almost literally changes from a girl to a woman. We see it in her body as well as her behaviour, especially when one of the boys at the club finds himself drawn to her, and she gets into it. There is not a bad scene or a lame/contrived moment in the film. The only error that I would say could be corrected is that one of the subplots ends on what feels like an unfinished note. Aside from that, Girlfight is a great movie. "},{"Title":"Excellent little sleeper movie about the world of womens' boxing.

With a title like that I figured it was some exploitation 'B' flic about inner city girl gangs.Much to my surprise it wasn't about that at all. Instead it is a well acted, well scripted story about a young woman who almost accidentally gets into female boxing. She is responsible for taking her younger brother to his practice sessions and get interested while observing his bouts. As he doesn't really want to be a boxer (only following through on their father's wishes) she convinces his coach to take her on in his stead. The story unfolds in an intelligent and believable way as she goes through various trials on her quest. For starters, her brother's coach doesn't want to take on a female boxer. After grudgingly doing so there is the problem of lining up matches for her. Then the confrontation with her father when he finds out what is going on. Yes, a love interest develops but it serves to enhance the plot, coming across more of an interesting inter-human reaction with its own fight related consequences.All in all this is a great little sleeper movie that few seem to have heard of. Some time later when I saw the much advertised and acclaimed Million Dollar Baby I thought wait a minute, this seems kind of familiar. Needless to say, I didn't watch Hart's War that night.

(Even the somewhat comparable Love and Basketball which focused on teen African-Americans was set in suburbia.) While these kids share some of the same peer problems, those issues shrink compared to the other struggles of these kids, where high school graduation could be the major accomplishment of their lives.The feminist element here is riveting in its originality, as you hold your breath to see if she can have a relationship--and a victory-- on her terms. A lots of audience sympathy goes to the guy who is challenged to rise to a gender-bending-expectations situation.The movie does drag a bit here and there, but this is no cheap thrills Rocky fight movie, as the practices and fights have complex outcomes, and all the relationships--especially with fathers and father-figures-- take more center stage than the center ring.

She just can't stay away from fighting. At home her father is constantly putting her down. Her brother trains boxing at a gym and one day when she picks him up she decides she also wants to train.It would be easy to call this movie a Rocky with girls i guess. But that is not at all what this is about. The story actually benefits very much from the main character being a girl rather than a boy. That way you can deal with more problems at once. First the problem of her not being accepted because she's not a girlie-girl, and then when she comes to the boxing gym because she's a girl at all. It's also a story about how a purpose can change someones life. How positive things can make you grow. I don't want this to sound pretentious, because the movie doesn't feel pretentious at all, but what i'm saying is true.Also Michelle Rodriguez is very good in the lead. It's a shame really that she has become stuck in the tough girl typecasting now, because that's really not what her part in Girlfight is all about. Sure she's a female boxer, but rather it's the more sensitive moments that really makes her shine.So maybe this is basically your average underdog story with a twist, but it's lifted way above the crowd by Rodriguez' performance.

He believes in her when no one else does -- possibly not even herself.The love story between Diana and Adrian is put to the test both figuratively and literally.  When she runs to him and they hold each other it is less about sex and more about two people who have not been held enough or loved enough and find that physical contact can be rewarding and gratifying instead of always brutal.Eventually of course you know that they must meet in the ring.All of the boxing scenes are gritty, tough and very real -- no punches were pulled in the filming of these scenes.The character of Diana's little brother Tiny (Ray Santiago) could have been explored a little more -- there may be a whole further film there.The cinematography by Patrick Cady moves from frenetic while in the ring to soft, sweet and intimate in the tender and quiet moments.The soundtrack is very nice -- adding just the right touches of emotion at precisely the right times.I wonder how many people that see this film make the connection that Ira (Tom Barbour) the owner/manager of the seedy boxing gym where most of the action takes place is also the billionaire father of Dudley Moore in the `Arthur' films!This is a first rate film with great production values, a great cast that has a compelling story to work with all put together by a brilliant director.It is a knock out!

Any movie that chronicles a fighter's rise from poverty and obscurity to success and fame, and that has an irascible trainer who is skeptical at first but then goes on to believe in his student, is going to look and sound like Rocky.  In an affectionate acknowledgement of that, the writer/director names the girl's romantic interest Adrian.  It doesn't have the schmaltzy taxi-liftoff-soaring- into-the-blue feel of Rocky, though.

The camerawork is fresh, the art direction simple and real, and the whole film has a feeling of reality that transcends it's low budget.  It also defies genre.  In places, it's a teen-rebellion pic.

The very first beat of the flamenco tune and hand-clapping sound in the initial frame already suggests the liveliness of it all. Writer-director Karyn Kusama delivered an excellent first feature film, Girlfight. John Sayles is one of the three executive producers - ah! premium quality,  and a cameo, too. A well-rounded cast, with Michelle Rodriguez as Diana Guzman the central flame of it all - her brilliant intensity exudes on the screen whenever she's present. One look at her, she reeks with rebellious spirit!The movie is full of subtle details. The various camera angles besides concentrating on Rodriguez deep-set eyes and facial expressions, also included quick captures of quotes on the gym walls about boxing  When you're not training, someone else is training to kick your A--! Champions are made not born. Winners never quit. Quitters never win. We follow Diana's struggle to attain her goal to be a boxer. Jaime Tirelli as Coach Hector seems to come so naturally. Don't be sorry. Don't ever be sorry, he encouraged. And when he smiles, the whole world lights up, Rodriguez cannot not give her all at her boxing for Coach, for herself. Santiago Douglas provided an attractive Adrian opposite Rodriguez' Diana.This is also a very good teen movie - much more meaningful than the usual Hollywood teen fluffs. We have intense family drama with father-daughter, brother-sister relationships; high school drama with girl quarrels; tough boxing ring lingo and first love talks; coach training young budding boxer - a controversial female protégé, who proved girls can be as powerfully fit as boys in a boxing ring! Yes, we're given a climatic gender blind boxing match. Kusama weaves a mean tale and she seems to know the subject matter at hand very well. We lapped it all up with disbelieve and thorough enjoyment. She also choreographed tender scenes and vulnerable moments at the right pace and tempo. Music applications were most complementary.

Finally it has come to a theater near you, and not a moment too soon.  In an age where movies with young actors seem to fall into 3 categories (slasher films, gross-out comedies, or sappy 'boy gets the girl' romances), Girlfight is a refreshing change.  And it's the best movie I've seen this year.First off, this is not a movie about a female boxer (The Next Karate Kid meets Rocky).  It's a wonderful character study about a young girl struggling to find her place--who happens to end up as a boxer.  The film reminds me of Boyz N the Hood--a gritty portrayal of urban teens trying to survive in difficult circumstances.  And it's refreshing to see well-written (not one-dimensional stereotypical) roles for minorities.  Thankfully, there are amazingly talented independent filmmakers to create these films (first time writer-director Karyn Kusama for Girlfight)--because the major studios fail miserably.  Note for film buffs Kusama 'cut her teeth' under director John Sayles (Limbo, Lone Star, The Secret of Roan Inish, Eight Men Out), who appears in a cameo as a science teacher.This film succeeds due to the great performances of the actors more than brilliant writing--this isn't a Cameron Crowe film where the young characters speak in beautifully crafted phrases.  And the cast is uniformly excellent.  Michelle Rodriguez makes an amazing film debut.  Diana is a very complex character, and Rodriguez covers all the bases.  Also, you never think you're watching an actress--you are watching a boxer.  The hard work and boxing training are evident throughout the film.  Calderon and Santiago do fine work as Diana's father and brother, and Douglas is great as a tough boxer with big dreams.  Douglas and Rodriguez have some great interactions (Life with you is war.  Maybe life's just war..period.)  But Tirelli really shines as the kind-hearted Panamanian boxing trainer who's hesitant to train a girl at first, but ends up as a father figure.  The interactions between he and Rodriguez are the best moments of the film.While this isn't a movie about boxing, there are plenty of fight scenes.  And they are technically impressive.  I really liked some of the camera work during the bouts--especially the 'point of view' camera where you see the punches coming at you.  And like I mentioned earlier--you're not watching a stunt double.  Rodriguez does all the boxing scenes, and she's the real deal.  The world of amateur boxing isn't glamorous, and this movie doesn't pull any punches (pardon the pun).  But this is the world Diana chooses, for it's the only place she truly fits in.  The physical nature of the sport helps release her pain and anger (though not all of it, as we see later in the film), and it gives her a sense of self-worth that's sadly been lacking.With a small cast and a an even smaller budget, Girlfight lacks the polish and gloss of the other films I've seen this year.  And it's still a better movie than all of them.  Be warned the dialogue is realistic, and it definitely earns the R rating for language.

Girlfight spends a lot of time on its characters -- we feel like our relationship with them is constantly developing, instead of stopping after a certain point, as it does in many movies.  The people in Girlfight are not predictable, but nonetheless, are intelligent and very real.  The movie does not go for any cheap stereotypes or quick feel-good resolutions, but in the end, leads us to a worn-out, emotion-drenched satisfaction like what we might feel after a boxing match of our own.

I finally saw it when it got released on video, and understand the glowing reviews.The movie opens in a high school in the middle of a ghetto. We quickly get introduced to student Diana Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez). She has a bad-ass expression on her face, and any idea about Diana that we might derive from this expression soon gets corroborated when she gets in a fight. As Diana gets in trouble for this, we then meet her father, an aggressive type in his own right; clearly we can't totally blame Diana for her attitude.But then the movie really picks up, as a new thought germinates in Diana's mind boxing as a way to escape this grim existence. Her older brother has already gotten into boxing, but her father most likely won't approve. Only Diana herself can decide what to do.Just the first few minutes alone identified that I was in for a very gritty, non-Hollywood movie, but the brief appearance of John Sayles in a supporting role truly affirmed that. Even before they get to any boxing scenes, you feel like you're getting pounded in the face at seeing the ugly life that Diana lives. And when they finally arrive at the film's main story, there's no turning back.All in all, I definitely recommend this movie. I will admit that using boxing as a means to show someone trying to make something of himself/herself has been sort of a cliché in cinema for many years (Rocky, Million Dollar Baby), but I still think that they did a great job with it here. In fact, this may have brought the genre to its apex. Really good. Too bad that Michelle Rodriguez wasted herself in Hollywood movies after this one. "},{"Title":"CHAMPION movie!

In fact, compared to Rocky, this movie is not very good. It is stuffed with some of the most hackneyed sports cliches you'll ever see. Maybe it's just impossible to come up with a decent sports film. It always comes down to a final fight. There are very few options along the way.POSSIBLE SPOILERSTo thicken the proceedings, three conflicts are built up. One between the main character, Diana, and her friends at high school, one between her and her father and her family situation, and one between her and her new boyfriend. Unfortunately, all are lacking in certain ways. The first, between her and her classmates, falls flat quickly. Maybe I just have a strong distaste for anything involving high school (I've been thankfully out of that situation for several years now), but I feel it is all underwritten. None of her classmates are developed in a significant enough way to make us care about the outcome of the conflict (and, to spoil it, they never resolve the issue). We'll skip her family relationships for the moment (they're a bit complicated) and go on to her boyfriend. It's all pretty cliche, with Diana feeling jealousy over the trampy girl who always is trying to get her man back. Also, and it comes as no surprise, she is forced to box her boyfriend in the film's climactic scene. First off, the director/writer cheats by refusing to give us a good view of the actual match. She films it in slow motion and cuts out significant portions, giving you no idea what is happening in the match; when the decision comes, you have no clue who will win. That adds a bit of suspense, but an actual boxing match, something that you may crave by this time (there's very little boxing in the film, really), would have produced more suspense. However, the boyfriend situation works much better than the friend situation. The actors have chemistry, and, although cliche, I did care about their relationship. Their final scene, although sewn together with formulae, is touching (it is an ode to the famous ending of Francois Truffaut's The 400 Blows, where we end in a freeze-frame towards which the camera moves closer and closer).Now I must talk about the relationship between Diana and her family. I'm not sure I understood the situation with her brother, and I'm not sure whether that's my fault (it was hot and humid, and thus difficult to pay attention at times) or the writer's fault. Anyway, I'll take the blame for that one. What I can argue over is the relationship and situation between Diana and her father. He is a very interesting character, and I think he's diminished by both the writing and the actor playing him. The casting for this character was very poor indeed. He's supposed to be a brute who has changed his ways (supposedly; I might have misinterpreted this situation, also). Diana accuses him of driving her mother to suicide by beating her. This whole backstory is what stimulates Diana's character the most, and Kusama develops it very by-the-books (straight from Screenwriting 101), mentioning it passim. She (Kusama) thinks she's being really subtle, but she ends up underplaying it too much. If I had written it, I would have given this whole conflict much more prominence, as well as the role of the brother. Still, the way it is done gives any mention of the mother an emotional background, and two scenes involving it are probably the two best scenes in the film one where Diana is forced to sell a locket which contains pictures of her and her mother (she keeps the pictures of course, but it is heartbreaking when she is standing outside the pawn shop with those two naked photos in her hand) and one where Diana attacks her father physically, accusing him of killing her mother.A couple of more things about the writing and the direction it would also have been good to develop more strongly the relationship between Diana and her trainer. It seemed to me as if Kusama had wanted to do this, but chickened out. It ends up being rather cliche. I'm beginning to paint a picture which, to me, seems pretty clear. I'm betting that Kusama had a much more complex film going for her, one that may have soared past its cliches like an eagle, but that she felt as if it would be far too long a film if she had used it all. I have mapped out four different relationships that Diana has to deal with, and all four peter out for the most part. All four could have been developed much further. But it ended up being 111 minutes long, about the average length, maybe even a little more, for a feature film. I've already shown Truffaut's influence on this film. Godard, the other French New Wave giant, also influences quite a bit. Jump cuts are used constantly. Godard's first film, Breathless, is most famous for its jump cuts, and he said that he used them so often because, for his first film, he didn't want it to be too long. Jump cuts cut significant time from the film. This is obviously why Kusama jump cuts so often, and, like Godard's Breathless, it is her first film.But I have done little besides complain! I must tell you why it overcomes its weak script! Michelle Rodriguez absolutely shines. Seriously, I think I'm in love with her and I pray that she'll get more parts. I remember, when commercials for this film would air on television, friends would comment on how ugly Rodriguez was. I think she's absolutely stunning. She has so much personality and so much skill in this film. You may correctly say that she sports only one expression throughout the film, a scowl, but you ought to notice, too, that Rodriguez is expressing a lot of feelings underneath that scowl. It is only a front, a defense mechanism, and Rodriguez (as well as Kusama) knows this. Her Diana is an endearing character, and, as hackneyed as the film can get at times, she always makes it worth watching and I always cared for her.I give the film a 7/10. May we see Michelle Rodriguez soon in another film. This woman's Oscar material.

Girlfight is a film about the human spirit.  Its a film about finding something to love in an otherwise bleak world.  For Diana Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez) that world is an 11th floor apartment in a Brooklyn housing project, a miserable high school experience and the knowledge that her mother killed herself to escape any further beating at the hands of her father.  The thing that she comes to love...is boxing.  It makes no difference to her that it's a mans sport.  There isn't a punch in the world that can compare to the punch in the gut that she feels everyday. Once she has found the one thing that makes her happy, Diana goes about proving that with a lot of sacrifice, hard work and total dedication anything is possible.Michelle Rodriguez is wonderful as Diana.  Her performance is filled with an inner rage and she comes across as wise beyond her years while maintaining the frozen innocence of a girl who lost her mother at a young age. Rodriguez portrays her character with an understanding that belies her experience.  Perhaps her lack of acting experience is the key to the whole turn.  A true breakout performance and it's only an unfortunate matter of time before Hollywood gets their hands on her.  The true star of this film though is the filmmaker, Karyn Kusama.  Kusama proves that you need not use million dollar pretty faces and big Hollywood stars to make a beautiful film. In fact, this movie would have fallen flat with a star in the lead. Kusama's direction gives Girlfight a beautiful look, the look of reality that is so hard to find at the General Cinema.   It's not an Oscar winning movie, it doesn't have to be.

So the new definition of 'feminine' gets established as no longer being soft and empathetic but hard, strong, and muscular (masculine).We have the always present abusive father who also happens to 'support' those bad traditional and 'sexist' roles found in intelligent cultures everywhere across the globe.We have the 'tiny' effeminate brother, helpless before the might of his sister when she beats down and nearly strangles her father in the kitchen. Tiny boy represents Kusama's acceptable role for a male as he can do nothing but beg his sister who now rules the house.Lastly we have the ridiculous love interest named after Rocky Balboa's wife, Adrian, who falls in love with Diana but then must fight her in the ring... um yeah right. So in a nutshell Diana beats up all the men in the gym, finds a surrogate father who shows her that, physical reality be damned women can do anything. She then beats her up father, and then beats up her boyfriend who then begs to have her back when it's all over! Kasuma fantasy is pretty simple- she covets male power, hates men, and despises femininity, so her answer is the fantasy of women becoming men (while still being labeled women) and for men to turn into women or just disappear entirely.

BUT they do not consist of a young girl who has been training for under a year taking on a true PRO contender who has been boxing since he was a small kid!! Also the winning of the final in the end smacks of 'Karate Kid' rather than the gritty reality of a 'Raging Bull'... so don't fall for a lot of the comments belowBut I dont want to stress that point as I feel the film is really trying to put across a point (a very important point) that transcends strict realism. This is what moved me to reply to some of those who seem to want to maintain that the film is not feminist at all!? Some put forward that it's just a story of a girl who likes to fight (seemingly because she's a bit of a tom-boy) and so she starts to box and finds her niche that ultimately makes her happy?Although that is undeniably true to a degree, if that was all this film was about (or even primarily about) then the whole lack of realism would be a much more important defect overall... But for me its not really about that at all. Instead its about a girl who's very person has been overlooked and ignored both as a women in a male society and also on a personal level as a daughter with her (ambiguously) abusive and sexist father...Boxing doesn't give her just an outlet for violence, it allows her whole body (and a magnificent one at that ;) become the centre of attention for the first time in her life . As any boxer (or athlete) will tell you the attention given to the body of the boxer creates a great sense of empowerment and self esteem. The beauty of Kusama's film is that she portrays a young (feminist) woman not just seeking to do her own thing whatever the consequences, but one who is desperately seeking recognition and attention.In the end (BIG SPOILER) Diana is distraught DESPITE winning the fight exactly because she has lost the attention of the one person who has become most important of all; Adrian. The happy ending is only resolved once she gains both Adrian's admission that he gave (and still gives) her full respect as a person but also the attention that she craves.Finally as to whether Diana's character makes a good role-model... what's that got to do with anything? Movies don't have to be made to show us how to behave and frankly its a bit disturbing to think that some people think they should.A very good film. But most of the credits belong to Kusama's vision of Diana... and Rodriguez's suprisingly brilliant portrayal of her.

Michelle Rodriguez is probably one of my new favorite actresses---it's not only the fact that she *can* act, but that she chooses the roles best suited to her that are more meaningful and important than what would first seem. I've read a few comments expressing their relief that this was not some awful feminist thing as they thought beforehand, but I certainly disagree. Diana is a feminist. She follows her dreams and believes in herself contrary to what practically everyone around her thinks (with the exception of her caring brother Tiny and her trainer and manager, Hector, who proves to be more a father figure than her real parent), which is what the word Feminism is all about. It's good to see films like this showcasing the true side of feminism--that they're not a bunch of manhating losers--but that they have dreams and can do anything. Diana is true to herself while still falling prey to love, and she and Adrian have a more realistic, complicated relationship rather than just something that magically works out. Girlfight is a true taste of reality and it put some faith back into my perception of people. Thanks, Michelle.8/10 - A very important movie that's relatable to not just young women, but everyone wanting to go far in their lives.

I saw this at Sundance and thought it was one of the best at the fest.And yet, I'm not as in love with this movie as a lot of other independent film lovers.  The reason is simple.  I think the movie is a little bit over the top.  From a political standpoint, it hits all the right notes.  However, it stretches credibility at the end and also gets a little smarmy.This is girl is SO tough, by the end you would think the filmmakers could set up a fight with Mike Tyson and he would have to resort to cannibalism to keep her at bay.Overall, it's impressive, and you won't be disappointed.  Just keep in mind that the movie is trying so hard to say something positive about individuality, personal strength, and feminism, (commendable as that is), that it sometimes loses sight of where reality might come in, and in that regard undercuts itself with the viewers it most wants to win over.

Her skill is awesome. She is a truly brilliant actress and one who's career I will eagerly continue to follow (as with that of writer/director Karyn Kusama). The inclusion of a love story in films about a spot is usually to show tragedy or as a way to give the actors something else to do. Here Michelle and Santiago Douglas have real chemistry.

If one actress can make this 'dreams come true' story convincing, it's her. Sassy on the outside and filled with sorrow and rage is not easy to play without tipping the balance. I think the young actress has found that line admirably. Thus, we go up in the story's somewhat predictable plotline and take its punches on the chin. First time director Karyn Kusama can be forgiven for some sloppy camerawork and undecided editing when the strength of what's good in Girlfight gets at you. The strongest scenes all take place in the ring. Her sparring session with a young boxer she hates and her eventual fight against him show how well Rodriguez knows how to give several layers to her anger. Especially the girl's second fight, against a female amateur champion, is extremely well handled; it is one scene where the editing is breathtaking and the camera regularly comes up close; where it should be in a box match. Karyn Kusama's script never loses the hard edge a story like this needs to keep the audience interested and not turn the film in a soppy tv movie. Most of the dialogue, especially when the young girl confronts her disapproving father, has a truthful ring to it. Forget about all that, however, and watch Michelle Rodriguez's moment of glory. She carries the film so well, it is hard to believe it is her debut role.

"},{"Title":"Compelling drama about gender roles and finding your niche","Date":"25 April 2001","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Sport","Review":"  Well-acted and gripping, this film featured a completely convincing unknown cast and a redefining of what a woman can be. Some have complained that it's improbable that the character of Diana would face (SPOILER approaching) her boyfriend in the ring at the end of the movie. I don't think that the point is whether she really would or not. Yes, it's a long shot, but more bizarre events have occurred. In reality, I think this scene demonstrates a highly interesting psychological situation. It's a more symbolic than realistic moment. Why is it important to separate the personal from the professional? How do you overcome long-ingrained sexual stereotypes in a modern relationship? How does fighting for yourself make you more capable of being an equal and a real part of a romantic partnership? Michelle Rodriguez is wonderful in the lead role. Her character, Diana, defends herself by channeling rage and frustration at her dysfunctional family life and dead-end future into becoming a skilled, focused athlete. Ironically, by fighting, she increases her self-esteem and becomes able to relate to others, instead of just giving in to her short fuse all the time. She gains discipline and an ersatz boxing family consisting of her trainer and her boyfriend, Adrian. Adrian makes you wish you could meet a man that masculine. Although it's a huge struggle, he doesn't let his pride get in the way of a relationship he believes in. He has the internal strength to overcome the unthinking machismo he has been taught to portray and feel. THAT is sexy. It also shows a lot of self-confidence. And as she says at the end of the film, the fact that he got into the ring with her and treated her like anyone else showed her respect. As she knows, she damn well deserves it.Yes, this film is somewhat predictable. So what? It was highly realistic in an emotional sense. I sympathized with Diana's character and was completely engaged throughout. This is one of the better movies I've seen in quite a while.

Surviving an unrelenting series of disappointments and traumas, she takes her anger out on the closest targets.When she sees violence transformed and focused by discipline in a rundown boxing club, she knows she's found her home. The film progresses from there, as Diana learns the usual coming-of-age lessons alongside the skills needed for successful boxing. Michelle Rodriguez is very good in the role, particularly when conveying the focused rage of a young woman hemmed in on all sides and fighting against not just personal circumstances but entrenched sexism.The picture could use some finesse in its direction of all the young actors, who pale in comparison to the older, more experienced cast. There are too many pauses in the script, which detracts from the dramatic tension. The overall quietness of the film drains it of intensity. This is a good picture to see once, if only to see the power of a fully realized young woman whose femininity is complex enough to include her power. Its limitations prevent it from being placed in the see it again and again category.

But her character is utterly unsympathetic throughout, and what's worse, the filmmakers don't seem willing to acknowledge that and set her up as the heroine. They argue that the right place for a stuck-up girl who can't control her violent urges, thinks the whole world owes her something and likes solving her problems by punching people in the face is the boxing ring - I say it's the loony bin. The romantic subplot is trite and shallow  - Rodriguez and Douglas fall deeply in love after meeting twice. Good performance by Joe Mantegna look-alike (and act-alike) Jaime Tirelli, as the coach.

This story has been done many times before and done better also.  Every single frame of it was predictable.  Aside from the predictable story line, the movie was badly directed.  The boxing scenes were so choppy, I couldn't tell what was going on!   And why focus so many shots of their feet?  Also Santiago Douglas (playing the boyfriend Adrian) is very handsome and has a nice body.  Unfortunately, he can't act.  The scenes were he tells Diana (Rodriguez) he loves her were laughable--there's not a single emotion on his handsome face.  The only worthwhile thing about the movie were two performances--Michelle Rodriguez and Jamie Tirelli as her coach.  They were very good, but can't carry the whole movie themselves.  This has a made-for-TV feel to it--just remove the swearing and you got a Lifetime movie!  A total waste of time.
