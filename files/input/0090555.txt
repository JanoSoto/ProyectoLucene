[{"Title":"The Film that Put Down Under on Top (10/10)","Date":"17 September 2002","Score":"57 out of 67 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy","Review":"  One of the great things about movies is that every once in awhile the unexpected happens, something comes along that you know immediately is just a bit different and special somehow.  Usually it's the film itself, but on occasion-- and this is one of them-- a character will emerge who is not just a character in a movie, but IS the movie.  Here, it's the title character of `Crocodile Dundee,' directed by Peter Faiman, and starring Paul Hogan as the inimitable Mick Dundee, a rather unique individual hailing from the small hamlet of Walkabout Creek, Australia.  Mick hit the big screen in 1986, and from the first moment he appeared, right up through the end of the second sequel, it's been a `G'day' for audiences around the world.In Australia on assignment for her New York newspaper, journalist Sue Charlton (Linda Kozlowski) runs across a story she just has to pursue.  It's about a legendary `local' from one of the small towns on the cusp of the bush, a crocodile hunter who, the story goes, had his leg bitten off by a croc, then managed to survive by crawling, alone, for days on end across the outback.  So it's off to the town of Walkabout Creek in search of this larger-than-life character, who it turns out is quite a `character' to say the least.  He is, in fact, one of a kind.  After a memorable meeting in the town's only pub (one of about four buildings in the whole place), Michael J. `Mick' Dundee agrees to take her on a tour retracing his steps and reconstructing the famous event where it actually took place.  He promises a hard journey through some rugged terrain-- no place, in fact, for a `Sheila'-- but, like any good reporter, she's ready for anything; or so she thinks.  And it's the beginning of an adventure she, as well as the audience, will never forget.Hogan concocted the story and created the character, then wrote the screenplay along with John Cornell and Ken Shadie, after which he turned it over to director Faiman, who did a worthy, if not exceptional, job of translating Hogan's vision to the screen.  Faiman, however, is destined to be the forgotten man with regards to this project, inasmuch as he was not only necessarily overshadowed by writer/star Hogan, but he presented the film in a fairly straightforward manner, without anything particularly noteworthy that `he' did that would put his `signature' on it.  Add to that the fact that this was the first of only two films Faiman ever directed (his second was the lackluster `Dutch' in 1991); simply not enough to reference him, nothing added to his resume afterwards to make you take notice and say, `Oh, yes, he directed &#145;Dundee,' too.'  Still, filmmaking is inherently a collaborative medium, and as they say, a film does not `direct' itself; so credit must be given where it is due, and considering how good this film is, and how well it did at the box office, it points up that whatever Faiman did, he did right.  And he deserves to be acknowledged for it.It's no secret, of course, what really makes this film work.  Aside from the engaging story with it's romantic notions of adventure, from beginning to end it has the four `Big Cs' going for it  Character, Charisma, Chemistry and Charm.  Let's face it, Paul Hogan is `The Man' as Mick Dundee; he's the guy other guys admire and want to be (whether or not they'll admit to it), and he has the kind of natural good looks, charisma and charm that is irresistible to the ladies (whether or not they'll admit to it).  And the chemistry between Hogan and Kozlowski is irrefutable; it's the kind that makes you want to put another shrimp on the barbie.  Besides all of which there is an innate honesty about Hogan's Mick that shines through like a 1st order Fresnel light in a London fog.  He's laid-back and grounded, with a refreshingly logical outlook on life-- this guy's never going to need a pill for hypertension-- and what adds even more to his appeal is that there's a touch of larceny in his make-up, hiding just beneath that twinkle in his eye and his obvious integrity.  You also know instinctively that this is the guy you want in your corner when the chips are down.  All of this and more is what Paul Hogan captures in his performance; this is the Mick `Crocodile' Dundee he brings to the screen.In her motion picture debut, the lovely Linda Kozlowski brings some sizzle to the screen and proves to be the perfect counterpoint to co-star Hogan.  Something of an `Ibsenesque' role model, she demonstrates that a woman can be strong and ultra feminine, capable yet vulnerable, and all at the same time.  It makes her portrayal of Sue Charlton convincing, well rounded and real; much more than just a cardboard cutout kind of a character that could have been used as nothing more than a vehicle to move the story along.  Instead, though this is without question Mick Dundee's story, she makes it her story, too, and it gives the film an added perspective and considerably more depth than what is usually found in light comedy, which is essentially what this film is.  And there's a look in her eye and something in the way she smiles at Mick that has an absolute ring of truth to it.  You could say, in fact, that Hogan and Kozlowski are the Bogie and Bacall of the outback.Another invaluable asset to the film is the performance of the likable John Meillon as Mick's friend, Walter Reilly.  The part is a true character actor's character, and Meillon does it beautifully.  The supporting cast includes Mark Blum (Richard), Michael Lombard (Sam), Steve Rackman (Donk) and Reginald VelJohnson (Gus).  A memorable film filled with unforgettable characters, `Crocodile Dundee' will take you to the top o'the world... `down under.'  10/10.

It's a winner in every sense from Hogan's wonderfully laid-back performance to his own screenplay, featuring an array of classic quips and moments.

This is a film that neither my husband, my teenage son, or myself can resist watching time after time, whenever it happens to be on TV.The movie tells the tale of Mick Dundee, a charismatic adventurer from Walkabout Creek in the Australian outback, who ends up as a 'croc out of water' (as some reviewers have cleverly phrased it) in New York City. Naturally, there's a 'sheila' with him, a love interest in the form of beautiful blonde American journalist, Sue Charlton. The sparks fly between them, the chemistry cooks, and so on.This movie of course is made solely by the legendary character of Mick Dundee, played to charming perfection by Paul Hogan, both in his native bush and also Big City settings. You'll be in stitches, you'll cheer for him, you'll be amazed at his adaptation of his unique Down Under bush survival skills to the streets of the Big Apple. The knife incident...what can I say? He displays an endearing innocence of the seedier aspects of Big City life, notably its drugs and prostitutes. But it's not only Mick's humour and charisma, this adventurer is a guy with integrity that would put most everyone, rural or urban, Australian or American, to shame. The greatest supporting role here must surely go to Mick's bush buddy, Wally, who's basically 'all talk and no action', yet one of the most likable ever film characters.The ending? I won't give it away, but it's a dilly, a dandy, and a doozy. Just one of the many reasons I can watch this great movie again and again. The first Crocodile Dundee sequel is equally entertaining, and though the second (Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles) doesn't quite measure up, I can never resist watching Mick in action.

Two sequels followed this movie. They were decent but could not measure up to this effort.Not only was this a big success for Hogan and everyone else connected with it, but I believe he got a wife out of this wife, going on to marry his co-star Linda Kozlowski.As someone pointed out, Hogan, as crocodile man Mick Dundee made the rest of the world aware of a number of Aussie phrases. Few men played as manly as likeabe and charismatic a hero in the 1980s as Hogan and Mick. Twenty years later, this is still a fun movie to watch now and then.

Or is it the Croc out of the Water? Whatever it is, it's one of the best of its genre.Crocodile Dundee is about a newspaper journalist (Linda Kozlowski) who travels out to the Outback, where she meets with Mick Dundee, better known as Crocodile Dundee. After wandering around in the Outback for a few days with Mick, writing her little story about surviving in the Outback, she decides that it would be interesting for her (or her newspaper?) to bring Mick back to New York City, where she lives. Mick reluctantly agrees, and travels to New York City clad in his croc-skin vest and Australian hat. Now Mick will have to adjust to modern life if he wishes to survive in New York.Crocodile Dundee is, in a way, very typical of its kind. For example Mick walks off the plane to NYC and steps onto an escalator, dressed in his Australian attire. Now, no matter how innocent and inexperienced a guy is, you can't tell me he's not going to realize he looks a bit odd in his clothes. The first thing I'd do is try to change to fit in better. But, you see, this is half the fun of this films, and all Fish Out of the Water films for that matter. If the main character did adapt straight away to his new surroundings, not only would it make for an awfully boring tale, but it would not be a proper Fish Out of the Water film.Not only is Paul Hogan completely convincing in his role as Mick Dundee, he is utterly likable from the start. He's a nice, innocent Outback man who learns what the fast life is like, yet sticks to his old ways. As we can see from the less-successful sequels, Mick never really adapts to his surroundings. He learns how to survive, but he never buys fancy clothes or such he sticks with his croc-vest and hat. While Crocodile Dundee isn't exactly a great comedy, it's one of those that can be remembered for being very funny, and it is easy to watch. It has a certain charm to it, like many of those eighties' comedies. It makes it hard to hate them. Just yesterday I wrote a review for Opportunity Knocks with Dana Carvey. That movie wasn't great, but it's hard to dislike it. While Crocodile Dundee is about ten times greater than Opportunity Knocks, it still isn't an excellent comedy. But because of its likable charm and great sense of humor, it's definitely one to see and watch many, many times.There have been a lot of these kinds of films Blast From the Past, Bubble Boy, to name a few recent of the genre. But Crocodile Dundee ranks as one of the best of its kind.4/5 stars -John Ulmer "},{"Title":"Paul Hogan!","Date":"4 April 2001","Score":"20 out of 24 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy","Review":"  Hogan was the reason for this films success.He really comes off naturally and is very charming.The direction techniques of this movie was only fair and the story is very very simple BUT another secret of this movie besides Mr. Hogan is the great screenplay.No wasted scenes and the story just moves along taking the audience with it for more.The screenplay works so well that although the movie is one of the most predictable movies ever,the audience still enjoys the ending,and to top it all off,the audience actually wants more!Now this is a way to make simple movies.Charm our hearts and take our emotions and curiosity for an entertaining and educational ride.Extreme gimmicks and million dollar effects are not always required.Back to the basics filmakers! "},{"Title":"The First Great Australian Comedy","Date":"1 March 2005","Score":"18 out of 23 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy","Review":" The Australian film industry first began to come to international notice in the seventies and early eighties with films like Peter Weir's Picnic at Hanging Rock and Gallipoli, Fred Schepisi's The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith and Bruce Beresford's Breaker Morant. Most of these were films with a serious theme and, often, a historical setting. Crocodile Dundee was different. Not only did it have a contemporary setting, it was also perhaps the first great Australian comedy- certainly the first Australian comedy to achieve international success.The protagonists are Mick Dundee, a bushman from northern Australia, and Sue Charleton, an attractive young female journalist from New York. Sue is on assignment in Australia, and hears stories about a legendary crocodile hunter from the small outback village of Walkabout Creek. (The name may be homage to Nicolas Roeg's film Walkabout, one of the earliest manifestations of the Australian New Wave. One of the stars of that film, David Gumpilil, has a part in Crocodile Dundee). Sue meets Mick to interview him and travels with him into the bush to see the scene of his famed encounter with a crocodile that nearly cost him his leg. She then arranges for him to travel back to New York with her- the first time he has been outside Australia or visited a city.The film is essentially a romantic comedy. Romantic comedies generally deal with a couple in love and the way in which they overcome obstacles to their love. A common type of obstacle is a discrepancy in their social backgrounds, and this is the type we have here. Sue and Mick seem to be polar opposites. She is a typical product of the American East Coast elite- urban, wealthy, professional, politically committed to liberal causes. He is from a working-class background, rural, apolitical with no fixed employment. As another reviewer has pointed out, he is as much a fish out of water in the city as she is in the outback. To make things worse, he is considerably older than her, and she already has a boyfriend, her editor Richard. There is, however, a saying that polar opposites attract, and this is as true of characters in romantic comedies as it is of magnets. The marvellous ending on the crowded subway station is one of the most memorable finales to any romantic comedy, rivalling that of The Graduate. Some romantic comedies concentrate on romance at the expense of comedy, but Crocodile Dundee is not one of them. The film is brilliantly funny, especially in the second half when the action moves to New York. The main source of the humour is Paul Hogan's title character. Mick is a rough diamond, but decent, kindly and good-hearted. Most of the laughs arise from his innocent misunderstanding of the seedier aspects of life in the big city- there are jokes at the expense of prostitutes, criminals like the muggers who flee when they see Mick has a bigger knife than they have (That's not a knife. THAT'S a knife!), transvestites (one of whom Mick mistakenly tries to chat up), drug takers (Mick thinks cocaine is a cure for blocked sinuses) and psychiatrists (Haven't you got any mates to talk to?) This last sentiment touched a chord in Britain, ever suspicious of the American obsession with psycho-analysis. Mick may be apolitical, but he is also politically incorrect- much of the humour is aimed at the culture of political correctness, just starting to burgeon in the mid-eighties. There are jokes about race and gender, and Dundee is not only a drinker but also a heavy smoker. (And this during a decade when smoking was almost banished from the screen).Some of the humour is perhaps a bit exaggerated- it is, for example, difficult to believe that Mick does not recognise the prostitutes for what they are, as he is no sexual innocent but a red-blooded ladies' man with an eye for the Sheilas- but this is deliberate exaggeration for satirical effect. The film both satirises and celebrates Australia's self-image as a land of self-reliant pioneers from the outback- most modern Australians, in fact, live in the suburbs of a few large cities- by contrasting idealised rural Australian values with the supposed vices of urban America.Despite the great success of this film, the sequel was less successful and Paul Hogan and his lovely co-star Linda Kozlowski (who later became his wife) did not perhaps go on to the glittering careers that some had predicted for them. Nevertheless, Mick Dundee will live on as one of the great comic characters of all time, and the film itself as one of the best comedies of the eighties and possibly the best Australian comedy ever. 9/10 "},{"Title":"He went walkabout.","Date":"29 November 2009","Score":"8 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy","Review":" New York reporter Sue Charlton hears of a guy in the outback of Australia who survived an attack by a crocodile. For research she meets up with Crocodile Mick Dundee and spends time with him out in the dangerous Bush Country. Finding a rapport during their time together, Sue convinces Mick to go back with her to New York, which brings interesting results as Mick becomes a big hit by treating the Big Apple, and all that comes his way, the same as he would the Outback.Crocodile Dundee has a standard fish out of water comedy premise, yet with a number of truly funny sequences and an appealing turn from Paul Hogan as Dundee; it became a monster smash hit that the cinema watching public lapped up with glee. In a decade that is often considered to be the worst for film, it may just be that cinema goers were desperate for a pick me up movie? Something that Crocodile Dundee most assuredly is. But to give that credence would, I feel, be doing it a disservice, for in spite of the rickety concept and the obviousness of where we will ultimately end up, it has bundles of earthy charm, a charm that many can identify with.As Dundee goes about his way, meeting pimps, transsexuals and muggers et al, they are not only very funny scenes, they are also points of reference to the ever changing way of the Continents. The film does come dangerously close to falling into a sugary rom-com mire, but with a strong performance from Linda Kozlowski as Sue, and Hogan introducing an icon to 80s cinema, Crocodile Dundee safely hits the target that it was surely aiming for. Besides, the love story here is very easy to get on side with.Two sequels would follow, the first one was a retread reversal and just about passable, the second one, after a gap of 13 years, was bad and evidence that the joke had long since passed. Crocodile Dundee 86 holds up well as the escapist piece of cinema that it is.

Thatcher was in 10, Downing Street, Reagan in The White House, 'Dallas' and 'Miami Vice' were the biggest programmes on television, and the film everyone was talking about was Paul Faiman's 'Crocodile Dundee'. At my local Odeon the queue stretched right round the block. Nothing like it had been seen since 'Grease' ( 1978 ). Its star/writer/creator was Paul Hogan, who came to the attention of British television viewers when his Australian sketch show was bought by the fledgling Channel 4 network. On top of that, his Fosters lager adverts proved popular, particularly the one where he attends a ballet and does a double-take when a Nureyev-like dancer twirls onto the stage Strewth! Bloke's got no strides on!.As was the case with 'Monty Python & The Holy Grail', backing for 'Dundee' came from various sources, but the investments paid off. It was the second biggest money-maker in the U.S. that year ( the first being the awful 'Top Gun' ), beating out 'Platoon', 'Star Trek 4 The Voyage Home', and 'Aliens'.So what was it all about? Divorced journalist Sue Charlton ( Linda Koslowski ) travels to Australia to meet the survivor of a crocodile attack. In the outback, she finds eccentric crocodile poacher Michael J. Crocodile Dundee ( Hogan ). After spending some time with him, and being impressed by his personality, she takes him back to New York. The first forty minutes are good fun, but when it moves to the Big Apple the film really gets into its comedic stride, as Mick struggles to come to terms with American culture. He washes his socks in the hotel bath, chats to a stranger in the street as though he is an old friend, and, when a mugger tries to rob him at knife point, whips out his blade, and grins That's a knife!, causing the terrified man to flee.Suddenly a new folk hero was born. America had 'Superman', Britain had 'James Bond', and Australia now had 'Crocodile Dundee'. Hogan was ruggedly good-looking, and quick-witted. Audiences the world over were charmed by his laid-back manner. Unfortunately, they never accepted the actor in any other role.He attributed the picture's success to the love story at its heart. I think Linda Koslowski has not had enough credit for her contribution to the film; not only is she sexy, but intelligent and funny ( and looks great in a thong! ). The romance spilt over into real life for the stars.One person who could not have been pleased with the film's success was Barry Humphries, whose 1971 comedy 'The Adventures Of Barry McKenzie' ( starring Barry Crocker ) also concerned an Australian man let loose in a foreign country. The films are very different. 'Dundee' is heart warming and its characters warm and likable, 'McKenzie' on the other hand is raucous ( lots of vomiting and urinating ) and rude. I like both films for different reasons.Oscar nominated for Best Screenplay, Hogan attended the 1987 ceremony in his 'Dundee' clothes. Two years later, a sequel came out - 'Crocodile Dundee 2'. It did not do the big business of the first ( I thought personally it was superior ) but proved popular all the same. Alas Hogan waited until 2001 to make a third picture - 'Crocodile Dundee In Los Angeles'. Audiences yawned.Twenty-five years later, the original film stands the test of time as a delightful, crowd-pleasing comedy.

When she decides to pay him a visit in The Outback she discovers a man so different to any other person she has met before she can't help but be captivated. She manages to persuade him to return with her to New Yoik, whereupon the classic 'fish out of water' comedy shenanigans ensues before, eventually, their love wins over out all. It's trite, true enough, but Hogan is so damn likable in the lead role nothing else really matters. In truth this is a film where nothing really happens, the focus instead being on the lead man and his interaction with all that is around him, be it the familiar when on his home ground, or the utterly alien when in NYC. Kozlowski is a great sidekick, too, and their genuine chemistry illuminates the screen, a chemistry so potent that they ended up marrying in real life. Comedies are not normally my thing, but this is so unrelentingly charming and, crucially, actually funny that it's hard not to find it endearing. The score must have a special mention too, a haunting didgeridoo drone that really raises the hairs on the back of the neck.

It is set up for us to like the guy, even celebrate him. Quite probably, this is a result of political advertisements that convince that intelligence is somehow a reason for mistrust. It is not new, I know, but the widespread acceptance of it is true. The dumber, the better. Before that, we have movies with less severity where the hero was just plain naive. He would be an intelligent, honest, even brave man but out of his element. There would be some jokes about this, but his good nature would see him through. These films go all way back. This one came along after a drought of a few years it seems, so seemed new. Our guy is established as a rough and tumble fellow. He might be engaged in illegal work, or perhaps he is chasing off poachers. The choice is ours, but we know that he was adopted by the blacks, and has some of their magic. He comes to the big city. The movie revolves around him winning the hearts of the New Yorkers, and getting the girl. The fold here is mildly interesting; the girl is a reporter, writing a story about him, and she basically falls in love with the story. But watching this now makes me embarrassed for a whole decade. This was actually nominated for an Oscar. The public liked it and screenwriters in the Academy thought the screen writing was so good it deserved recognition.It has two appealing set pieces. One sold the movie in the trailers. It is the deal where he is accosted by some street thugs who pull a knife. He pulls a bigger one and they run away. The other clever writing is the zinger at the end where New York working men relay messages of love across a crowded subway station. On her affirmation, he literally walks on top of them to get to her, while the crowd (representing us as audience) cheers. Four seconds of embrace with rising music and the end. But in between is some tired, repellent stuff, even the joke about confusion over plumbing appliances. I think the girl here was writer-actor Hogan's real girlfriend.

There's a good supporting cast on both sides of the world, which helps out a great deal.Although I enjoyed the film, the funniest things I heard in the theater came from the audience.  One came from a woman seated behind me.  When Linda Kozlowski first arrives and is picked up from the helicopter, she gets in the left side of the vehicle.  The woman behind me asked, Why is she driving?, oblivious to the fact that Australians drive on the opposite side of the road.  The other came from a friend of mine.

On top of this, Linda Kozlowski is both likable and lovely, possessing an attractive spirituality and intelligence.Paul and Linda have great chemistry. The chemistry is real seeing as how they would marry four years later in 1990.

He's a great writer and critic, but he obviously missed it big on this one!Crocodile Dundee was the most successful Australian film ever. It only runs about 90 minutes before the credits start.

I really enjoyed watching it because of the great leads and good writing that exceeded the regular rom com tropes.The two leads for Crocodile Dundee were fantastic and worked each other perfectly. Paul Hogan underplayed the part and went for very subtle performance without ever going for the scenery chewing or mugging at the camera. Because of that, all the things that happen to him in New York feel genuine and his reactions and actions are the more funny. Linda Kozlowski plays the journalist/love interest and she is fantastic. Not only she is beautiful but also sweet and charming. You immediately expect for her to act like Willy Scott from Temple of Doom or other screaming women, but she is the exact opposite. She freaks out when something terrible happens in the wilderness but doesn't whine or act like stereotypical City Girl stock character. You really like these people from the get go and you want them to get together by the end. The rest of the cast are mostly forgettable and doesn't leave much of an impact.Crocodile Dundee is well written and directed. While you might see a lot of romantic comedy clichés, especially the ending but there no misunderstandings or moping around. There a lot of funny scenes and it doesn't overshadow the romance part either. The characters are pretty basic and doesn't offer too much in terms of characterizations, but that's not really the point. Were really in for the comedy and romance which work really well. It's well directed, well acted and has loads of quotable lines and memorable scenes. If you haven't seen and you are not a cynical hipster type, you will enjoy this film.

God, that sounds corny (after a pause) Why do you make me feel like Jane in a Tarzan comic? This is Sue Charlton (Linda Kozlowski) relieved when Mick Dundee (Paul Hogan) got rid of three thugs after showing them what a real knife is. The line stops being corny when she admits it and unveils a subtle intelligence within the story, as if by comparing the hero to a movie icon, it makes him ordinary within the film, while indirectly establishing his extraordinary status as a movie character. I read that Crocodile Dundee was a surprise hit at the time of its release, being the second highest-grossing film of 1986 after Top Gun. Actually, I'm more surprised that critics were surprised because Crocodile Dundee is precisely the kind of creations that made the 80's such a great decade on the field of fun, sheer escapism and movie heroes. And Dundee is as cool, brave, macho and bad-ass as Indiana Jones, Conan or Rambo, but for a change, he doesn't kill people, and he's far more sympathetic and likable than any of them. I say 'likable' because there must be a reason why a film with no stars and made by an unknown director would meet such a big success. Apart from word of mouth, I can't figure.Although the word is hackneyed, the crocodile hunter is as iconic as Indiana Jones himself, immediately recognizable from his black hat with gator teeth, his vest, his brown leather jacket, his Aussie accent and a hidden scratch in his leg he cutely calls a 'love bite'. The 'love bite' has been exaggerated into a bitten-off leg on its way to New York, but it decided Sue Charlton to go to Australia and interview the mysterious legend, a legend even more embellished by Mick's friend Walter. In a pub, Dundee makes a spectacular entrance and reveals beneath his toughness a very down-to-earth personality and an irresistible sense of humor. Creating an unforgettable character is not an easy task, yet Crocodile Dundee does and that's a credit to Paul Hogan's fine performance, rightfully earning him the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Comedy.Linda Kozlowski was also nominated as she plays her part perfectly. She's the audience that is invited to discover Mick's world with the nosiness and curiosity we expect from a female journalist (that's Dundee talking). And the exchanges between Mick and Sue reveal a subtler writing than in any other comedy or romance, when she mentions that the Aborigines own the land, you could tell it's an overly reverent statement but Mick corrects her immediately arguing over who owns them is like two fleas arguing over who owns the dog they live on., no room from predictable lines Mick's age? The last time he asked when he was born, the Aborigine who raised him said in summertime. When Walter informs them he'll be back in Wednesday, Mick nods but after a pause, has to ask what today is. As Walter comments Doesn't know. Doesn't care.And during the two-night trip, Sue, the 'sheila' discovers this world where the notion of time and property cease to exist. Whatever 'sheila' means woman or foreigner, she's clearly an outsider and the script tactfully avoids the cliché of the feminist urban female, Kowzlowki plays her character very naturally, she doesn't get offended by Dundee's macho comments, she knows where her place is and she doesn't even save Mick or flirt with danger to prove something. This is crucial because it also helps to create a natural bonding process with a realism that is almost equal to Meryl Streep and Robert Redford in Out of Africa. And the film uses humor as the perfect language to highlight the growing complicity. For example, he cooks her some snakes and disgusting animals, she tries to eat them while he casually opens a corned-beef can. Humor is not just granted because it's a comedy; it's a real side of Mick's personality and his most endearing charm. And it is pivotal for the plot because it leads to what everybody expects the invitation. This is when Crocodile Dundee works like the missing link between Harrison Ford in Raiders of the Lost Ark and Eddie Murphy in Coming to America, a film it probably inspired. Dundee is still exotic enough to feel like a fish out the water when he's coming to America and provide a funny view of New York City from a foreigner's perspective, pinnacling with the famous 'knife' scene. It probably deals with more formulaic situations than the first act. We're not that thrilled by Linda's pompous fiancé, who naturally is totally different from Mick, but it's Mick Dundee we follow with an interested eye, evolving in an urban jungle full of prostitutes, junkies, and transvestites. The film doesn't sugarcoat the reality (hence the unforgettable shot on Sue's swimsuit) but it's faithful to Dundee's adventurous and friendly nature. I doubt he would have enjoyed staying in the hotel and watch I Love Lucy. The formula of the second act is redeemed by the way it's handled until the unforgettable climactic scene. But what the film succeeds is to create a defining character of the 80's, a sympathetic macho icon who, for once, doesn't kill and doesn't take himself seriously, and a great script, rightfully Oscar-nominated. I know I mentioned the script several times, but that's because many directors would take the premise for granted and forget about the writing. The French tried to make their version through the infamous Little Indian, Big City and although a commercial success, the film was a disaster. The story was going from archetypal situations to convenient resolutions with no heart, no wit, no characterization, no charm whatsoever.One must endure this horrific film to realize why Crocodile Dundee is so great, believe me, mate!

Mick or Crocodile Dundee, and nails the role to perfection - as he should, given that he was also responsible for developing and writing the story. Linda Kozlowski plays Sue Charlton, the American newspaper writer assigned to write a feature story about this mysterious man from down under. The story begins in Australia, where Charlton is the one out of her element, dependent on Dundee to overcome the dangers often encountered. She also becomes his voice of conscience, however, pushing him to take action, for example, against kangaroo poachers. It's in Australia where we also see one of the more disappointing parts of the movie, however - disappointing because it was unnecessary. I'm referring to the shot of Kozlowski in what I thought was an unlikely choice of bathing suit to wear under her clothes in such conditions. I'm not against a shot of an attractive woman when it serves to move the story along. This one simply didn't do that. Anyone ever heard the word exploitation?Moving to New York City, we now see Dundee as the fish out of water, adjusting (somewhat better, I would say, than Sue did in the outback) to life in the big city. Dundee takes on pimps, prostitutes, transvestites and muggers  - and always manages to come out on top. The American scenes, I thought, were by far the funnier. All in all, it's an enjoyable couple of hours to spend, although (ironically, since Hogan and Kozlowski later married in real life) the romance between Mick and Sue just didn't strike me as real.

It actually is a love story. Pacing is great there's an obstacle or two to overcome. And if you take the fact that they are falling in love on screen and off screen. it's really great to watch.

There was a time when the slender blonde leather faced Hogan was everywhere here in the UK, mainly advertising beer and acting the gruff Aussie, it was very popular.I think what is so endearing about this film is Hogan's character, his charm, lack of tact, surprising strength, rugged looks, Tarzan like abilities, gloriously over the top threads, blatant unknowing male chauvinism and the overall stereotypical rough Aussie masculinity bordering on rudeness we've all heard about. The epitome of the typical Aussie cowboy living in the merciless Aussie outback. Yet despite all that he's still a decent man, good natured, bit of a ladies man and a very likable fellow who does what's right (most times) or what he believes is right. He accepts who he is and we the audience accept it too, he's a bit of a lad (albeit middle aged lad).I tend to think that the rather over board portrayal of 'Mick Dundee' is kinda toyed with for the international audience. I'm sure there are folk like this in the depths of the outback but the extreme stereotyping going on I think is there to make people laugh, give them what they expect but bigger. Everybody has a perception of different people from different countries and this is what many countries probably expected to see (at the time) when it came to Aussie blokes living in the bush (or Aussie males as a whole).The ragtag, scruffy, unwashed, unshaven, dirty shirt wearing bar patrons in 'Walkabout Creek' pretty much some up the humongous stereotyping going on. Or maybe I'm wrong, maybe this IS how blokes in small desert towns of Australia's outback look and behave!. Maybe all the sheila's are rather butch with cropped hair and work behind the bar...beats me, but it seems a tad forced.The plot is pretty much your Prince Charming type affair really, but in the Aussie outback, a modern day Tarzan. The beautiful blonde Kozlowski goes walkabout with Hogan's Dundee, gets into dangerous situations, shown how to survive, meets local Aboriginal tribes folk and slowly falls in love with the athletic bushman.The first half of the film is set in the outback of Oz and displays terrific scenery alongside some great visual gags and exciting moments, including Kozlowski's ass. The second half of the film is set on the streets of New York and again displays some genius visual gags (for the time) alongside more expected exciting moments...you just knew the pair would come across street punks at some point.What is amazing is back in the day (and now even) this film was a fresh idea, it was quite unique and still is really. If you scratch beneath the surface it tends to have a kind of 'Police Academy' motif/theme really, lots of obvious setups for hero moments, love scenes, silly gags etc...But its such a slice of good wholesome cheer I really can't fault it at all.You know what I'm gonna say...looking back this film is horrendously clichéd, cheesy and predictable, seriously so. But back in the 80's this was a tremendous hit and rightly so, it has everything you could want for a great fun time with a lovely happy ending.

This one does genuinely have a lot of funny(if primarily based on stereotypes) jokes and gags, quite a number of them surprising(and several remind us of the laughs we had before political correctness grew to its current position of immense power over our freedom of speech). The clash of cultures does go over the top at times and that we cannot relate to; and the characters really aren't developed(also a trait that can be found in other movies from the period), and the romance between the leads is pretty unconvincing. There's arguably too little consequence to many occurrences. Acting is average, though the Aussie is charming. The boyfriend is obnoxious and purely there to provide opposition to Mick's infatuation, and even that he doesn't succeed in. For how average the editing and cinematography are, this does present us with attractive footage of the great outdoors.

The romantic sub-plot is predictable and the general jist of the humour is as you would expect. But the movie really works primarily because of Paul Hogan's turn as the title character. He is very convincing - too convincing perhaps as he has been typecast ever since. He captures Mick Dundee's confidence at home in Aus, as well as his naivety in New York. And as this latter factor is the basis for most of the comedy, it's the strongest section of the film. There are numerous funny encounters with various New York denizens. And while it's not exactly a hilarious movie, it's certainly a likeably humorous one.Whatever you do though, watch out for the edited pre-watershed TV version of this film that seems to be broadcast regularly.

While there she is severely out of her element but manages to snag an interview, and he shows her around the bush. She then invites him back to New York City, and when they get back there, he is even more out of his element. Everything there (bathroom appliances, fancy restaurants, escalators, African Americans whom he mistakes for Aborigenes, etc.) takes him by surprise, and he has trouble adjusting, but he makes do. You'll be surprised by the results. This is one of my favorite movies of all time, and I guarantee you will love it too.

Hogan is quite charming as Nick Dundee, the Australian Croc wrangler. Overall, I'm not sure there is any great acting on his part - you get the feel he is just great at simply being himself in this movie. I think this is proved out by the fact that his movie career never really took off outside of the Dundee franchise.Hogan and co-start Linda Kozlowski seem to have a good chemistry going between them - but turns out this wasn't really due to good acting on their part either. They became a real life couple soon after, wherein he divorced his wife of almost 30 years and married Linda within the year.But there is a definite charm to the movie. It of course looks very dated now and not sure how much it will stand the test of time as being a truly classic movie. But there is fun to be had in watching this.

One might actually derive something about the theme of communication issues in Australian cinema having spent his entire life in the Outback, Mick experiences culture shock in New York, and assumes that an African-American man is an Aborigine! A sad irony to the movie's success is the Australian people's anger at Paul Hogan. It's not just that the flick made non-Aussies view the country as people like Mick. You see, the people Down Under like to talk about cutting down the tall poppy, which means making sure that no one can consider him/herself better than everyone else. After the movie's success, Hogan's marriage collapsed and he married his co-star Linda Kozlowski. As far as the Aussies are concerned, he decided that he's better than them. Is this really what our world has come to?! But no matter. It is a pretty funny film. Sort of a precursor to Borat without all the teenage boy humor.

"},{"Title":"From Barbecued Shrimps to New York Pimps and Boyfriend Wimps.","Date":"21 May 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy","Review":" Having grown up in Australia, I knew of Paul Hogan since the mid '70s. A regular face on Australian TV with his hilarious *Paul Hogan Show,* he was the paragon of the ocker Everyman. (Ocker is an Australian of low social caste, revealed through their broad accent and over-use of Aussie slang &#150; a near analogue of America's trailer park contingent.)These days, Paul Hogan is a god.I didn't know Hogan personally, although in 1991, I performed a few rock gigs with his eldest son, Clay - an apple who fell far from the tree. Not talent-wise, but industry-wise. In 2006, Hogan seems to have joined his son in that meadow, slowly rotting far from the industry's fickle tree. But in a fluke of good timing back in 1986, Hogan's weathered, masculine tracker character from the Australian outback happened to be the perfect foil to New York's 80s hairstyles, yuppie consumerism and disco sensibilities.From a story by Hogan, John Cornell and Ken Shadie, and helmed by mustered Australian television director, Peter Faiman, *Crocodile Dundee* not only put Hogan on the world stage &#150; it put Australia there too. *Dundee* captured the earthy, textured Australia that lent a heritage aspect to that juvenile backwater, and was largely responsible for the misperception of the hardened Aussie in subsequent Fosters beer ads. Though merely a modern, laconic retelling of the noble savage tale, the movie is refreshing enough in its simplicity and sincerity to garner itself a little shelf life in the Tarzan pantheon. American audiences were ready to embrace the blond, blue-eyed, rugged, crocodile hunter after Hogan kicked Australian tourism up ten notches with his spurious offer to put another shrimp on the Barbie. Even though there was no such thing&#133;Y'see, Australians call shrimp prawns. And no one &#150; but NO ONE &#150; *ever* included prawns in their barbecue menus. Take my word. I'm Australian. At the million or so barbecues I attended whilst growing up Downunda, barbecuists were known to put various foodstuffs on the barbie - sausages &#150; yes; t-bones &#150; yes; chicken, hamburgers, franks, buns, onions, fish, potatoes, tomatoes, chops &#150; but no shrimp. It was a fantasy created by American marketers. But, much like *The Godfather* influenced the vernacular and lifestyles of real mobsters, so too has that shrimp fiction become reality, in the States and Australia alike. To the point where I almost feel like *I'm* the one who is lying about the historical non-existence of this cuisine&#133;Onward. *Crocodile Dundee* finds Hogan as the somewhat mythical eponymous character, Michael J. Crocodile Dundee, infamous for his wild croc encounters. Sue Charlton (Linda Kozlowski), an American newspaper reporter on assignment in Australia, chases him down in a Northern Territory backwater, Walkabout Creek, spending three sensually-charged days in the bush with him (ostensibly to recount his tall tales for her column), then packs him off to New York with her, on the pretense of wrapping the tale Stateside, but more truthfully drawn to the masculinity which her effete American fiancé cannot provide.Throughout the movie, Dundee is a surprising blend of legitimacy (hypnotizing animals, a crack shot) and fakery (pretending to shave with his knife or tell the time by the sun's position); a fascinating mix of innocence (What's today, Wal?), philosophy (Aborigines don't own the land &#150; they belong to it), and machismo (with a heroic crocodile kill that saves Sue's life). The New York segment is, ultimately, where the fish-out-of-water absurdities are just waiting to happen. Nothing new here, as the film takes on a decidedly 80's plastic flavor, with Dundee encountering bidets, jealous boyfriends and jive talk, drag queens, muggers and pimps. Oh my.It's always nostalgic for me to hear the song Live It Up during the suburban party scene. Though performed by average Australian band Mental As Anything, due to never hearing it outside Australian shores, it has become somewhat of a poignant memory. The other party song, Different World, was performed by another obscure Australian band - INXS.During the Australian segment, Peter Best's soundtrack evokes Aboriginal otherworldliness by employing simple flute and guitar lines, Aboriginal clicking sticks and didgeridoo pulses. His main theme is brilliantly based on a one-note jogging pulse, tribal and sensual, like a heartbeat of the living earth.The cheesy romantic climax sees Woman Running Through Streets and Public Avowal Of Love clichés. Tempering this silliness is Best's one-note pulse, at first subliminal, sustaining and growing over five minutes, throbbing at our temples in driving urgency, and at the movie's final shot is like a throat-gurgling orgasm of sound, holding up the finale with its power, cutting through the cliché.Now that's a knife!(Movie Maniacs, visit www.poffysmoviemania.com) "},{"Title":"The Great Aussie Classic","Date":"15 May 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy","Review":" 'Crocodile' Dundee has to be the best-known movie to come out of Australia, and the one that made Paul Hogan's career.

Paul Hogan, who at the time was only known here in the U.S. for those traveling commercials for Down Under, co-wrote and stars in the role that would make him a movie star. Hogan plays Michael J. 'Crocodile' Dundee, a man who lives in the Australian Outback who is interviewed by an American woman from New York (Linda Kozlowski) who's intrigued by his story that he survived a brutal crocodile attack. Her few days with him in the outback become more and more interesting to her that she asks him to accompany her back to New York to wrap up the story. His visit to the Big Apple applies Crocodile Dundee with some of its biggest laughs. Like the way he looks at things, things that he's never seen before (for example, an escalator when he first arrives at the airport in N.Y.). He also encounters many other things and in the process makes alot of new friends. Crocodile Dundee may not be the best comedy ever made but its a pretty good one nevertheless.

The story is not only about an Australian in the city of New York, it's also about an American in Australia. None of those is preferred to the other We enjoy the half in Australia as much as the one in New York. And by comparing different elements of life in each country in an ironic way, the filmmakers make it impossible for the viewer (it was so with me, at least &#150; and I'm from Austria, which is another completely different culture) to choose where he would rather live. You can't like one without the other.(The sequel tried to use the same effect, the other way round (first New York, then Australia) and it's also quite nice, but it's not new any more and lacks the main qualities of the first part.)

Paul Hogan felt the movie will shed more light on the bushman behavior and what he will be like if he was brought to America. The movie was a box office success making like 40 times its production cost (budget $8.8 million, commercial success over $328 million) and received with very high positive reviews.The movie's innocent portrayal of the Dundee character makes it easy to fall in love with the guy and how Dundee manages to make new friends and get many people to like him also seemed like a recipe for a good film, which this movie was.The movie plot features our protagonist Michael Crocodile Dundee, who is popular in Walkabout Creek and the Northern Territory in Australia because of his crocodile hunting skills which left marks on his body.A news reporter from New York Sue Charlton (Linda Kozlowski) heard about his story and went looking for Dundee, found him and then brought him back with her to New York City, where Dundee gets a feel of how life is in the big apple.The movie then transcend into a love story between Dundee and Sue, with a beautiful ending.At the end of this film you will feel relieved and relaxed, and you will be tempted to see what else Dundee will get himself to. The high positive reviews that the movie got and the huge commercial success that it gained in the box office made the producers and Hogan make more sequels. So in 1988 a new Crocodile Dundee movie was released, tagged Crocodile Dundee II, which was less a critical success than the previous film and then 13 years later in 2001 a second sequel was made and tagged Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles.In conclusion this movie is a classic keeper, so I do advise that you get the DVD.www.lagsreviews.com "},{"Title":"Nothing Too Exciting Or Different,But Still A Lot Of Fun,","Date":"28 January 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy","Review":" Crocodile Dundee is a great movie with a good storyline,a great cast and plenty of very funny scenes.There is nothing about this movie that really amazed and the humor is nothing different and nothing I didn't see before,but it still is very enjoyable and I thought Paul Hogan did a great performance and makes Crocodile Dundee a very likable character.A female reporter from New York goes to Australia to find a crocodile hunter who survived an outstanding occurrence with a crocodile,and takes the Australian crocodile hunter to New York,which he finds very hard getting use to,but is falling for the reporter.

There are some interesting moments and more than a few chuckles once Hogan arrives in the Big Apple, but not much memorable. The big knife gag basically sold the picture to American audiences that ate this film up. Good thing for Hogan, since once you play a role like Dundee, you will be pegged as that character for life. You'd better have made enough to retire on! He hasn't done much since. Same thing for girlfriend-turned-wife Kozlowsky. She is attractive but adds nothing in terms of acting. There isn't much chemistry between them despite their real life coupling. My favorite part is when two hookers offer to give Dundee one for free since he is from out of town and helped them with their rough pimp. One what? he asks. Also got a chuckle when he pours some trendy New Yorker's cocaine into a pot of boiling water thinking the man has a cold and should sniff the steam instead of directly sniffing the powder.

So when their time ends in his backyard she invites him to New York City. He accepts but, having never been to a city before, is he ready for New York or, for that matter, is New York ready for him? It is hard for me to accept that this film is almost twenty years old as it doesn't seem that long ago since it was the big film of the time. Looking back now it is almost as hard to understand why the film was so successful because really it is just a fish out of water story that is forced into a clumsy narrative in the final third. This is not to say it is not enjoyable but I do have to wonder if we really needed two more sequels after this but perhaps it is the fact that the film has an easygoing charm about it that makes it an easy watch even if it is pretty standard stuff on the whole. The comedy is obvious throughout and trades on Hogan's rough Aussie personae as well as a load of fish out of water gags that never shy away from going for the easy target (oh look - it's an escalator/bidet/transvestite etc). For this reason it isn't that funny and really only generates a few chuckles here and there &#150; enough to keep it going maybe but nowhere near enough to make it a great comedy.As I said Hogan is a big reason it works because, although it has worn thin down the years, his swaggering Crocodile Dundee is a nice character and has an easy charm to him that does make the film. Kozlowski is pretty bland and she never convinced me that she would ever fall for Mick; they don't really have any chemistry and her performance simply switches from rolling her eyes at him to making big doe-eyes instead. Support is OK but nobody really stands out and the film is Hogan's to lead &#150; which he does in his own unshowy fashion.Overall this is a fairly average film that provides a few laughs from easy fish out of water jokes but is enjoyable mainly thanks to the easygoing charm of Hogan. Plotwise it is nonsense and the romance that it relies on is so unconvincing as to be laughable &#150; not helped by a rather bland performance from Kozlowski. Watchable but hardly the sort of thing you'd expect to be as big as hit as it was.

Which is a shame, really, given that films such as Lightning Jack are far more interesting than the million retellings of the Wyatt Earp legend, simply because it didn't take itself so seriously. However, after the best part of a decade spent entertaining his countrymen on television, Paul Hogan was ready to hit the big time with a feature film. His feature film struck quite a chord with the local audience, in spite of being simplistic to the bone.Crocodile Dundee relates the simple story of a hunter living in the most remote part of Australia. The story received by one American journalist, prompting her to come and see the man herself, turns out to be slightly exaggerated, but everything else about the man seems more fairytale than real. We are treated to some brief sequences showing how Dundee copes with situations that, while seeming extraordinary to the American journalist, are mundane to him. The sequence with the Kangaroo and the poachers is a classic, and there's even a clever cameo from Ernie Dingo.About a third of the way into the film, we get an abrupt change of gears, and the action shifts to New York. The premise being to put the straightest shooter into a facade-riddled place, and seeing how he copes with the change. Unfortunately, there are times when it goes a little too far, and simple common sense regarding social interaction winds up going out the door. Sure, the joke is a little funny, but it cheapens the character quite badly.Thankfully, the film recovers when Dundee, the character, gets more in tune with his environment. In particular, the infamous that's not a knife scene shows a canniness about the way the world works that we would have to wait another couple of sequels to see again. The comedy here is very stereotypical, but it has a pure heart about it, so it works. Hogan himself was on Australian television recently, introducing a compilation of his old shows, a speech in which he stated how much better the world was before political correctness. When we see a comedy in which an aborigine makes comedy out of the old please don't take my photo bit, or the New Yorker likens a white Australian to Tarzan, we can only nod in agreement.If there is one problem with the film, and it is a small one, it is that the characters aren't really developed to any real degree. They seem more like puppets in a sketch, mainly made to recite a series of predetermined actions in the hope it will produce a laugh. Experiments in computing along these lines were begun around the time this film was being made, and the limitations became apparent in a hurry. Once the surface has been scratched, there is not a lot else to get out of Crocodile Dundee.In all, I gave Crocodile Dundee a six out of ten. When you cannot predict what will happen next, it is a lot of fun. When you can predict what will happen next, the laughs dry up. Still, Hogan isn't taking himself too seriously here, and that's what makes all the difference.

The bug was caught once again in 1986 when Crocodile Dundee roared at the box office and with the critics. The story is pretty simple as Outbacker Paul Hogan (who actually received an Oscar nomination for co-writing the script) is the topic of a New York journalist's (Linda Kozlowski) newest story. Then after the story is complete, she decides to bring Hogan back to the states with her with hilarious results. Crocodile Dundee is just smart enough, funny enough and sweet enough to serve its purpose. Hogan dominates the action. He probably could have done his routine by himself and the picture would not have been much different than it is. Followed by two meaningless sequels. 4 stars out of 5.

Sadly this first movie did not live up to the fond memories in my mind. I'd have rated this as an 8, if I was reviewing it without rewatching it, however now it is not the case.Plot In A Paragraph Sue Charlton, a New York reporter (Linda Kozlowski) is working on assignment in Australia, when she heads to the outback to interview the living legend Mike Dundee (Paul Hogan). When she finally locates him, she is so taken with him that she brings him back with her to New York. In New York, Mike Dundee is amazed by the wonders of the city and the interesting people there.Paul Hogans performance is full of charm and I still find him an engaging lead as Mick Crocodile Dundee, but overall the movie was a letdown from what I remembered. Linda Kozlowski was the high point of the movie for this reviewer. She is gorgeous, talented, had great chemistry with Hogan (who she would later marry) and boy what an ass!! The scene where she is in the thong bikini is what has lingered in my memory, even though I didn't remember it from all those years ago. Reginald VelJohnson is a lot of fun as Gus the Limo driver. Mark Blum is simply perfectly slimy as Richard Mason, Sue's fiancée. I'll still watch the second movie now (I'm writing this during the ad break) but I remember it not being up to the standard of this one. I'll still vote it a generous 7/10. It would have been a 6/10 but I'm awarding a bonus point for Kozlowski's ass in THAT thong bikini.

It's difficult to argue with the most popular film of the season, even when co-writer Hogan exposes a callous attitude toward his audience by showing, in the final scene, a crowd of happy subway commuters all too willing to offer their heads for him to step on in order to be reunited with his lover.

Basically New York reporter Sue Charlton (Golden Globe nominated Linda Kozlowski) has heard about a man who survived a crocodile attack in Australia, and she thinks it will a make a good story, so she travels out there to meet and interview the man himself. The man in question is crocodile hunter and co-owner of a safari business, Michael J. Crocodile Dundee (Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Paul Hogan, also writing) who runs the business with Walter Reilly (John Meillon), his trusted friend and mentor. The interview is pretty straight forward, so then he offers to take Sue on a tour of the park which lasts a few days, one day they are attacked by another crocodile which Mick saves her from. After learning so much about Mick during this time she certainly has enough for a story, but she thinks there will be more to add if he accepts her invitation to come back to America with her, he does. He of course has never been, so he is fascinated by the new life style he has come into, and all the different cultures of people around him, he is essentially a fish out of water. Mostly everyone he comes into contact with as he explores the city and everything it has to offer are quickly lightened up with his naivety to city life, but there are those who threaten him and he gets his large knife out to scare them off. She may be romantically involved with her boss, the dull editor Richard Mason (Mark Blum), but slowly Sue is also becoming very affectionate towards the friendly Aussie bushman. It is after being proposed to by Richard that Sue realises her true feelings, dumps her boyfriend, and with the help of two guys in the large Grand Central Station crowd she stops him leaving New York, he climbs over the people, and they share their first kiss. Also starring David Gulpilil as Neville Bell, Michael Lombard as Sam Charlton, Ritchie Singer as Con, Maggie Blinco as Ida, Steve Rackman as Donk, Gerry Skilton as Nugget, Terry Gill as Duffy, Peter Turnbull as Trevor and Khristina Totos as Rosita. Hogan is a likable character that doesn't have a bad bone, it is like Tarzan in a concrete jungle story as he ignores some taunts and outwits some villains. It is slightly questionable how this very simple film became so popular at the cinema, and spawned two sequels, it is a tiny bit overrated and overlooked possibly, but a fun and easy to reasonably easy to swallow comedy adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. It was number 55 on The Ultimate Film. Very good!

One of the most endearing qualities in the character of Mick Dundee, though, is his flippant approach to even the most awkward of situations. It's very difficult not to love a hero for whom nothing is a big deal and everything is taken in stride with such zest. Add to that the chance for foreigners to see some gorgeous Antipodean locations as well, and you have the potential for a big hit, which is exactly what this film became.Paul Hogan may be almost as scaly as the creatures he's supposed to tangle with, but he does possess an undeniable charm, which is tapped to perfection here.

I have no idea, but if that is your typical Australian, then I just don't get the attraction.Dundee takes what he wants without a thought for the consequences, and the notion of altruism is entirely unknown to him. As long as he can have what he wants, all is well. He's probably unaware of the existence of other souls. And what he wants, he usually takes with force. Personally, I find the slaughter of animals for their skins or for sport to be abhorrent, and that alone should be reason enough to ban this film. Furthermore, it glamourizes brutality and power - traits that are also common to rapists and paedophiles. Enough said. "}]
