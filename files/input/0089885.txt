[{"Title":"The Academy Award for best use of a headless corpse goes to...","Date":"8 April 2004","Score":"69 out of 79 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":"  Most of the cheap or not so cheaply made horror films these days are nothing more than a tedious exercise in how to bump off as many teenagers in as many different ways as one can imagine in ninety minutes or less.  One need only watch recent films such as Wrong Turn or the remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre to realize how far the horror genre has fallen.  Once John Carpenter made the first Halloween film, we have been subject to an endless series of copy cat films whose only purpose seems to be finding an imaginative way to slice and dice the local teenage population.  All of the Freddies, Jasons, and Michael Myers films combined don't come close to having an ounce of the entertainment and imagination of Producer Brian Yuzna and Director and Writer Stuart Gordon's Re-animator.Professor Herbert West (Jeffrey Combs) is a scientist who has discovered a formula which brings the dead back to life by reanimating their tissue. After an experiment in Switzerland goes awry, he moves to Miskatonic University to continue his experiments.  One thing Professor West isn't and that is modest.  He even takes a few moments to ridicule a professor, Dr. Carl Hill (David Gale) when he disagrees with him about when death actually occurs.  He eventually rents a room from fellow student Dan Cain (Bruce Abbot).  Dan is dating Megan Halsey  (Barbara Crampton) who is the daughter of the college dean, Alan Halsey (Robert Sampson).  What Dan doesn't know is that the aforementioned Dr. Hill has a perverted eye on Megan also.  We know this because of the sleazy stares Dr. Hill eyeballs her with when ever she's around.  Think of Megan as being an overage Lolita and Dr. Hill as Humbert Humbert and you've got the idea.  All of this is not window dressing as it would be in some other films.  It all comes into play very nicely.  It goes without saying that sooner or later, Dr. West will be making good use of his reanimation formula, in ways only those with the most grotesque sense of humor can imagine.  To say any more than that would deny you of the true pleasures of this film.How can a film that is so explicitly graphic and perverted in nature be fun? It's because every person involved in the making of Re-Animator was smart enough not to take it too seriously themselves.  Everything in this film is so wildly over the top, that you can't help but chuckle right along with them as they wink their eye at you.  There may be certain moments of the film that would normally sicken even the most hardcore horror film fanatic, but since Yuzna and Gordon never once let Re-animator sink into the tedious by the numbers game of other films of these nature, these same scenes become intentionally cartoonish and silly.But more than anything, this film owes it's life to it's cast.  Jeffrey Combs as Herbert West should serve as the model for anyone wanting to make a film involving a mad or semi-mad scientist.  Given this kind of role, there is many an actor who would have been tempted to ham it up and alas in many horror films they do just that.  However, when Combs seems to imply that he is the smartest man on the planet and the rest of us are Neanderthal, we don't hate him for this implication at all.  He is so good at making us believe he is the smartest man since Einstein and we are all nothing but Cro-magnon man by comparison that we love him for it just the same.  He may be crazy, but he's a fun kind of crazy.David Gale as the smarmy Dr. Hill, is a joy to watch also.  He has some of the most ridiculous scenes in the film yet somehow manages to keep a straight face through it all.  He gives new life to the old saying about not losing your head over a piece of tail.Bruce Abbot as Dan Cain is the perfect contrast for West.  He is a straight arrow, is madly in love with Megan, yet somehow lets himself become involved in West's experiments.  Abbot also is smart enough to know that the center of this film is West, and never once overplays his role to try and overshadow him.  As for Barbara Crampton, she should have won some kind of award, just for the abuse the producers put her through as Megan.  Is there an award for most abuse of a female by the walking dead?Re-animator was made on a budget of less than a million dollars which is truly remarkable. There isn't a film budget in the world though that can replace the imagination and daring rampant through out Re-Animator.  And when a horror film is that well done, and is something all the Freddies, and Jasons, And Michael Myers can only dream about, I have no choice but to give it my grade which for Re-Animator is an A.

Re-Animator is one of those fun horror movies that is so over the top that it is just a lot of fun to watch, kind of like the spectacular Evil Dead films, although not quite to that same level of skillful horror/comedy mix. Ironically enough, I think it should be a testament to the quality of the rest of the movie that it is able to work so well despite prominently featuring a soundtrack that is a naked rip-off of the Psycho soundtrack. It's amazing to me that Richard Bond, the music composer, didn't think anyone would notice him plagiarizing one of the most famous movie soundtracks in cinematic history, but luckily everyone else in the production was right on the mark.Jeffrey Combs delivers a wonderfully crazy performance as Herbert West, the scientist in the movie who is determined that he has discovered a scientific method to beat death, and is desperate to try it out on a human being rather than small animals, on whom he has had remarkable success. He is playing a completely one-dimensional character, a genius scientist whose mental capacity is also tinged with madness, but which is counterbalanced by the fact that he may very well be desperate to try something potentially immoral but which could also potentially revolutionize medicine. Maybe his intentions are good after all, but for the purposes of the film, he just wants to get his hands on some fresh corpses, which is a great premise for a horror film.The movie operates in its own world, like the Evil Dead films did. It takes place in the horror genre but wants to combine some elements of drama as well, as we have a real scientist who is truly brilliant. He is still in medical school, I believe, but is often smarter than his often-published professors, criticizing their work for being incorrect or even plagiarized. He's very quick to make enemies, I would think his line of work might be easier the less people he had watching him, so it's unfortunate that he was so good at making people not like him. Mere days after he rents out a room from a couple of other students, they find their cat dead in his refrigerator. I hate it when new roommates do that.There is plenty of gratuitous nudity in the film, and while I appreciate nudity as much as the next guy, I don't like it when it drives a weak film, and that is certainly not the case here. There is a graphic and highly disturbing nude scene three quarters or so through the film that made me literally cringe and turn my head, not because of gore but by the sheer disturbing idea of it, it was awful. But the thing that I loved is that that scene fits in with the rest of this movie so well. It is all about too much gore and too much blood and too much nudity, but also lots of laughs. This is a perfect example of how much fun scary movies can be.

The introduction (added to the film at the last minute before its release) is a glimpse of the over-the-top nature of the entire production. If one were to be frightened by this intro, he or she will be comforted by the playful cheer of the opening title music. The score was heavily inspired by the famous Psycho score, a classic by Bernard Herrmann.The movie, inspired by H.P. Lovecraft's `Herbert West Re-Animator', follows a simple plot. Herbert West (played to precise pitch perfection by Jeffrey Combs who, like Bruce Campbell, is a B-Movie legend) is new at Miskatonic Medical University. Immediately, Herbert clashes with Dr. Carl Hill (David Gale) on the subject of `brain death'.At the same time, Dan Cain (Bruce Abbot) is looking for a roommate. He is also dating Dean Alan Halsey's (Robert Sampson) daughter, Megan (Barbara Crampton). When Herbert West shows up at Dan's door one night during a `study' session, Megan is immediately suspicious. Why is Herbert so anxious to move in? Why is he so interested in the basement?It is not long before the cat is dead, re-animated and dead again. The early scenes of violence are disturbing and hilarious at the same time and are only a taste of what is to come. Dan tries to resist the temptation of power inherent in the re-animating fluid, but is sucked into Herbert's mad world of life giving.There is a turn of events about halfway through the film (which I would be crazy to spoil) that almost screams to the viewer, `We aren't playing by the rules here.' The storyline twists its way to the famous conclusion that, if you haven't heard of it, will leave you breathless. Even if you know what is going to happen, when you finally see it, in all of it's gory, sexual glory you understand why this classic has achieved such a status. The finale of the film is twisted in so many ways it's impossible to count.Obviously, I loved the movie. Having never been anything but a horror fan, I cannot say it will suit everyones' tastes. The film is so over-the-top that the outrageous gore becomes less and less shocking. The timid viewer may want to shy away from this masterpiece. Anyone with even the slightest curiosity should seek this movie out.

He rooms with nice guy Dan (Bruce Abbott) but Dan's girlfriend Meg (Barbara Crampton) doesn't trust him.  And evil Dr. Hill (the late David Gale) hates him.  It seems West has a glowing green/yellow potion that brings the dead back to life...but they always come back in a foul mood.  But he hasn't tried it on humans...yet...Boy, do I miss the 80s!  Back then they could make extremely gory, sick, violent, unrated films like this and get them to play at mainstream theatres.  I saw this opening night in Boston back in 1985--it was unrated and no one under 18 was allowed in the theatre.  The audience was quiet at first, but as the violence and gore escelated and the black humor kicked in, the audience came alive.  People were screaming, yelling, laughing...just about everything!  Especially during a sequence between Crampton and Gale which just went way over the boundaries of good taste.  It was just great!  The movie is fun on its own, but with the right type of audience it really comes alive.The film has extreme gore...probably the goriest movie of its decade.  It also has huge doses of black humor and the whole cast blessedly plays it straight...it they had winked at the camera once it would have destroyed the film.The film also has a tight, well-written script (it runs 86 minutes), is well directed by Stuart Gordon and has a great cast--David Gale (sadly no longer with us) was fantastic as the evil Hill.  Jeffrey Combs plays West just perfect--we see his obsession with the potion but Combs never overplays it.  Abbott is somewhat bland but plays a very good hero.  Crampton is just excellent as Meg--sexy, smart and very brave.  Also Robert Sampson adds strong support as Meg's father.Basically a must-see for any horror fan.  Also a great score and I LOVE the ending!  Don't miss this one!Try to see the Special Edition DVD--it shows deleted scenes that flesh out the story more.

In the 70's we had The Exorcist, Halloween, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Phantasm-just to name a few. The 80's did produce a small but stellar group of classics, however, including Evil Dead 1 & 2, A Nightmare On Elm Street, An American Werewolf In London and, of course, Re-Animator. Like Werewolf and the Evil Dead films, part of Re-Animator's success and notoriety is the film's deliciously sinister blend of horror and humor. Wait let me correct that-perverse horror and sick humor. In accordance with the decade that birthed it, this film is typically over the top and totally gratuitous, pulling out all the stops at every turn. Jeffrey Combs heads a great cast as Herbert West, a strange and eccentric but brilliant young doctor/scientist who has perfected a syrum that can reanimate the dead. Circumstances get out of hand when a medical student and his fiance (Bruce Abbott & Barbara Crampton) get involved in West's work and a plagarist rival doctor (David Gale) plots to steal his idea. Horror and hilarity ensue from there on, thanks to imaginitive visual effects coupled with clever dialogue. For nitpickers like myself there are a few minor inconsistencies in the screenplay, but it does very little to hinder the film. Ironically, several scenes that wound up on the cutting room floor (included on the dvd) would have fleshed out those minor story flaws, but they were excised-and probably rightly so-in the name of pacing. Besides, any flaws in writing are easily forgotten about thanks to the terrific performances. Here is a cast that really brought the characters to life so to speak; Combs as the nerdy scientist and Gale's lecherous Dr. Hill are both standouts. And Stuart Gordon's strong direction holds the whole thing together even when the film threatens to be crushed by it's own outlandishness. For those interested, check out the sequel Bride of Re-Animator that followed 4 years later. It doesn't hold a candle to this one, but it's plenty of fun in it's own right.

Can death be overcome? West thinks so, and with his reagent serum he might just prove to the world how right he is.Re-Animator ranks at the very top of my all-time favorite horror movies. For a guy who has seen probably one thousand horror films, that's quite the accomplishment. For me, the film is paced perfectly, has plenty of gore, a fair amount of nudity (and a scene of sexuality you won't find elsewhere), some black comedy and a simple plot premise (a variation on the Frankenstein story).This is the film that gave Jeffrey Combs his place in cult film history. On the basis of this movie alone, he is sought after to appear in other horror films and appear at horror conventions. Sure, some of his other films are pretty good, and he had an impressive run on both Star Trek Deep Space Nine and The 4400. But he will always be known as Herbert West. None of the other stars (David Gale, Bruce Abbott, Barbara Crampton) has gone on to such a level of recognition.The film has some flaws. The score, which is supposed to be an homage to Psycho sounds more like a blatant ripoff. And my biggest pet peeve is trying to find a complete copy of the film. I owned the longer, R-rated version on VHS. Now I own the shorter, unrated version on DVD (the Millennium Edition). I have yet to find one that combines the gore of the uncut version with the plot of the R-rated one (which I think really drives home the story and fleshes out the motives and power of Dr. Hill).But the sheer fun of the film makes up for the flaws. Jeffrey Combs is clearly having plenty of fun, and the way they approach such things as the reanimated cat and the use of the reagent as an intravenous drug tells me they knew that the key was just letting a good time fly.The people involved with this film (Combs, director Stuart Gordon and producer Brian Yuzna) went on to make a variety of other Lovecraft-inspired films. So I guess I have to thank the success of Re-Animator for giving them the chance to pursue these other projects (even the less wonderful ones like Necronomicon or Dagon (which many people like but I wasn't impressed)).If you're a horror fan and haven't seen this, shame on you. You simply cannot have an in-depth conversation on horror without this film coming up. I urge you to check it out and decide for yourself. Can thousands of horror fans be wrong on this one? When have they steered you wrong before? "},{"Title":"An unquestionable classic!

'Motel Hell' is one exception, Frank Henenlotter's movies, especially 'Frankenhooker' are others, but to my mind Stuart Gordon's 'Re-Animator' is by far the most original and entertaining one ever made in my opinion. This movie put Gordon on the map and also made Jeffrey Combs into a worldwide cult figure. Combs is absolutely brilliant as Herbert West, one of the most memorable mad scientists in horror history, and the rest of the supporting cast - Bruce Abbott, David Gale, and the lovely Barbara Crampton - are all excellent. Gordon uses H.P. Lovecraft's West stories as a jumping off point for some grotesque and genuinely funny moments that once seen are never forgotten, particularly THAT scene between Crampton and Gale, which is now the stuff of legend, though beware it is cut from some versions of the movie. Make sure you see the uncut version of 'Re-Animator' whatever you do! Gordon went on to make some other Lovecraft adaptations, some good, some not so good, but 'Re-Animator' was the first and is still in my opinion the best. Highly recommended fun which gets better and better as the years go by! This movie is an unquestionable horror classic!

Viewing this film as such, rather than as a straight horror film (a film that's meant to terrify), I think raises its stature.Taken as a horror film, Re-Animator would really not qualify as anything other than yet another gruesome sort of zombie movie. Anyone who has seen this film, though, knows that Re-Animator is not your run-of-the-mill Romero knock-off, not your ordinary horror film. It's unique. There's something off-kilter about this flick, something very, very funny, and also something quite disturbing. Re-Animator (spoilers maybe), with its demonic cat, provides an instance of intense slapstick at which the audience laughs. Simultaneously, the audience must also feel revulsion both at what's taking place on screen and at themselves. Surely, a cat, it's neck broken for the sake of science and brought back to life only to die an even worse death is not something to laugh at. Yet it's staged like an old 3 Stooges episode. The film-makers undoubtedly understand this, desire to make their audience uncomfortable, and do a commendable job. Like all great Grand Guignol, then, it thoroughly disturbs. The cunnilingus performed by the severed head provides a similar moment. Viewed as a Grand Guignol, and an experiment in creating a distraught audience, Re-Animator succeeds admirably. It's an excellent movie, highly entertaining, and worth seeking out.8/10 "}{"Title":"Horror-comedy injects a healthy dose of irreverence","Date":"8 January 1999","Score":"17 out of 29 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":"  Stuart Gordon should be chided for allowing Richard Band to ape the great Bernard Herrmann's Psycho score in his music for Re-Animator, but don't let the similarity distract you this is a wildly entertaining movie.

Based on H.P. Lovecraft's ahead-of-its-time six-part novelette, Herbert West - Re-animator, this is an example of the kind of movie that made the mid-1980's such landmark time for this type of genre. Its gory to the extreme, and provides more comic relief for fans of morbid humor than any other film of its peculiar stature. Stuart Gordon keeps true to Lovecraft's unique style and locations, including the fictionally infamous, Miskatonic Medical School in Arkham, Massachusetts, where this crazy film takes place. Herbert West, perfectly portrayed by Jeffrey Combs invents a serum that can resurrect organisms after subsequent brain death, but the effects are catastrophic for med student Bruce Abbott and pretty girlfriend, Barbara Crampton as the bodies turn out to be mindless, violent zombies. Stuart Gordon adds plenty of excellent additives to Lovecraft's original story including a sub-plot with actor, David Gale as an acclaimed professor who steals West's ideas on reanimation.This is Lovecraft's already twisted story adapted into a non-stop display of madness and gore with great performances from a cast that clearly appreciates the subject matter. Jeffrey Combs is to Herbert West such as Anthony Hopkins is to Hannibal Lecter in one of the best character performances in horror movie history. Its zany, horrific and downright entertaining especially for fans of Lovecraft's bizarre cosmic science fiction. Great dialog, gallons of blood, intestines attacking like a hungry python and a talking severed head going down on poor Crampton while she's immobilized are just of the few hilarious highlights of this uproarious film. Followed by Bride of Re-animator and the equally effective Beyond Re-animator. This is an absolute classic.

They died when 'Scream' made them self aware.Nowadays, horror movies are made with cookie cutters and specific ingredients. They are a collection of make-up artists trying to out-gore each other and idiotic characters who are so poorly written that you just know that the real thing the writers were working on was how to get the required nudity into the script so that somebody might produce it.But, a long time ago...There was 'Re-Animator'! Gore! Zombies! Mad scientists! And, of course, nudity! But there was also something that I haven't seen in some time... a story. In the old days, they had a thing called a story and the other thing they had was characters who do things as a part of that story.You see, horror films are often ridiculous. Sometimes they try to hide that fact. Sometimes it works, like, 'The Sixth Sense' which was so engaging I forgot it was essentially a horror movie. Most of the time it doesn't work, like 'Cabin Fever' or 'Descent' or well, forget it. It just doesn't work and we'll leave it at that.But 'Re-Animator' works. On every level. I think it's because it knows that it's ridiculous but it just plows on through anyway. If you are going to make a movie about talking severed heads, mad scientists and zombies you have to know that the Academy is very likely to overlook you. But why not go for it? Every scene, every moment, they go for it! And Jeffrey Combs? He steals every second of every scene he is in, even when there is a beautiful naked woman there, you just can't stop watching him.

First, there is Dr. Carl Hill, a member of the faculty, who is motivated by lust, fame, and power. Not unsurprisingly for a man driven by such strong passions, the principal goal of his research is the location of the will in the brain.The other mad scientist is Herbert West, a medical student. West is dedicated to the truth, and cares nothing about women or fame. The principal goal of his research is reanimation, bringing dead people back to life, for which he has a reagent. West is so cold and devoid of sympathy that he is indifferent to the pain he causes when he reanimates the dead, supposing himself to be doing them a favor.West is openly contemptuous of Hill, whose intellect he regards as inferior to his own. Hill finds out about West's reagent and tries to coerce West into letting Hill get credit for it. While Hill's back is turned, West chops his head off. Then he reanimates the separated head and body. The body knocks West out and then picks up the head and bowl it is in, which is filled with reagent. All this leads to a final struggle between these two mad scientists, with Hill in control of reanimated corpses from the morgue. The movie is replete with hilarious horror and gore, including Hill's body holding Hill's head so that it can violate the Dean's daughter.It is unfortunate that the director's cut resulted in many deleted that should have been left in. First of all, these include scenes that make it clear that Hill has mesmeric powers. It is fitting that the man whose research focuses on the location of the will in the brain should have the power to control the will of others. More importantly, it helps us understand why Hill has so much influence over Dean Halsey; we understand how he can control his own body with his severed head; and we understand how he can control the corpses he has reanimated. Without these scenes of mesmerism, we don't fully understand how he can do these things.Second, several of the deleted scenes further develop West's character. Both in his physical appearance and his manner, he reminds me of Dean Stockwell's portrayal of Judd in Compulsion. Judd, of course, was that movie's version of Leopold in the notorious Loeb and Leopold case, in which two psychopathic geniuses decide to commit the perfect crime in order to prove they are Nietzschean supermen. Without seeing the deleted scenes, I might not have made that connection.Third, there is a great scene where West is discussing with Dan, his roommate, what they are going to do about Dr. Hill. West seems to be bothered in some way, and he lurches to the bathroom. When Dan goes to see what West is doing, he finds him with a syringe of reagent, about to mainline himself. West assures him it is just a weak solution, just enough to keep the brain sharp, so he won't have to sleep. Dan helps his shoot up, after which West is all pumped up and ready to go.The director said he deleted these scenes because he felt that they slowed down the pacing, and that is a shame. The scenes are included in the second disk of the DVD, and it is worth making the effort to watch them. Not every deleted scene should have been kept in, of course. The dream sequence, in particular, does not belong in the movie, and its deletion was appropriate.It is still a great movie, but with some of those deleted scenes left in, it would have been greater still.

Strange medical experiments, mad scientists! What's next?The character of Megan was great! Any fine looking actress gets my interest and being a medical student myself, I really felt for the pair. The film progresses and we get to know the pair and the life at Miskatonic University. What a great New England name! There's a great scene with the pencils in the cadaver lab. That scene alone is worth the effort. Herbert West does a really good job. I simultaneously feel his passion to continue researching, and hate him enough for him to be villainous. The ending is great too! What can we ask more than to truly empathize with the character and hope for a sequel?(SPOILERS) "},{"Title":"A great mix of horror and comedy","Date":"16 May 2013","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" A twisted, absurd and immensely entertaining horror film.

But there is only one individual in film history that is actually not afraid of them. This individual is Herbert West. I wouldn't say he loves zombies but he's definitely not scared of dealing with them. West is a scientist who has broken the barrier on how to keep people from dying. He has developed a serum that once injected into the brain, effectively empowers the cadaver to start living again. The problem? The turn out to being very livid, uncontrollable zombies.The story is loosely based off of H.P. Lovecraft's work, Herbert West, Re-Animator. The whole film is quite weird actually. It's definitely a story not many people would tell but it just so happens director Stuart Gordon was able to pull this film off with just enough weird and clever things to make it enjoyable. Playing Herbert West is Jeffrey Combs; the callous non-emotional scientist, that is, unless he's dealing with his work. Combs is so good at his character, that although he makes it look like he has no idea what he's doing, he seems like he does.Co-starring Combs is Bruce Abbott as Dan Cain and his girlfriend Megan Hasley played by Barbara Clampton. Unfortunately, due to West's flamboyant ambition, these two main characters will be sucked into his web of problems as time progresses through the film. And this all happens when Herbert West is transferred to Dan Cain's college. There, West convinces Cain to help him in his studies. Not much else needs to be said, it's a domino effect from here.To many fans, this movie is a dark comedy. Even though I enjoyed it, I found it more bizarre than funny. There were a few moments where I did laugh, either because of Jeffrey Combs' ability to give his cracked character a dry sense of humor (now and then), or, just how clumsy the zombies were. Speaking of which, these zombies are not your standard zombie. No, this is not the tear your flesh off your skin down to the bone zombie. The zombies depicted here are just plain angry. Almost like they didn't want to be re-animated and they were mad at West for doing so.Special effects are actually fairly decent here for 1985. There's not a lot of blood but enough to satisfy. If you're a fan that likes crazy nude scenes, you'll especially like this one. Like I said before, this film is just strange. As for music goes, Richard Band created the score. I have to say, Brand really doesn't create any scary tones. He does create some tension but his music is rather choppy and unconventional which makes it hard to feel anything from it. Again, a strange film but enjoyable in some areas.The classic that brought Jeffrey Combs to the screen is peculiar and creepy. This is a different kind of zombie flick and if you enjoy all kinds, then it's right up your alley.

Why? Well there are different factors adding up to this; it is based on the H. P. Lovecraft story and it has Jeffrey Combs starring in it. This was actually one of the first movies that I saw with Jeffrey Combs and what made me become a fan of his work and acting.The story in Re-Animator, to those unfamiliar with the timeless work of Lovecraft, is about Herbert West (played by Jeffrey Combs) whose study in reanimating dead tissue goes awry and drunk with power, the scientist craves for more specimens to conduct his experiments on. But reanimating is not enough for West, and he starts to dabble in crossing living matter and animating it to life. Helping him with the ghastly work is his roommate Dan (played by Bruce Abbott).Sure, the effects in the movie are ridiculously outdated and crude by todays standards, but back then they were quite good and actually were impressive to look at. When you see it today, the effects make the movie appear campy and sort of goofy, but still the movie is driven by the solid story and not the visual effects.Re-Animator spawned two sequels which also were quite good, and they were all part of a great many movies that Jeffrey Combs starred in that were based on the work of H. P. Lovecraft. I thoroughly enjoyed the movies back then, despite not being more than a teenager at the time, and I still enjoy them this day today.Being an avid fan of H. P. Lovecraft's writing, this movie (and many others based on his work) are so far from doing the immortal writer any kind of justice at all. But take it for what it is, a movie meant for entertainment that is based on his work. Keep movie and books separate as two different medias and outlets of information; one does no justice to the other.It was a shame that the fourth movie in the series never came to see the light of day, but one can still hope that the project will eventually come to be completed.

It has some dark humor, lots of blood, some nudity, more blood, great (I mean really great) acting by Jeffrey Combs ... Inspired by a 5 page novel by HP Lovecraft where Herbert West invents a formula than can make the dead come back to life, it ends with the dead tearing his body apart in the end (like we see Dr Halsey being dismembered by the mob of undead), it takes liberties into putting the theme in modern day society. The introduction scene where West works with Dr. Gruber, introduces us to the strange experiments West does. Then the opening credits with the somewhat light classical music and images of body parts as they study them in med school. We then see Arkham university - Akham is a town where a lot of Lovecraft stories take place. We soon understand that West is a very strange individual, who has left his humanity in the closet, and his new friend Danny is a normal teenager enjoying life with his girlfriend. But of course things start to change with West reanimating Dan's dead cat (the scene in the basement is astounding, with West reanimating the poor cat after, saying  he's screaming because he comes back to life! - he then takes the part of the mad scientist in the old black and white movies). Then horror and blood escalates, yet with some character development for the main cast and the villain, Dr. Karl Hill  even with his head cut, he can lust for Meg and fulfill his desire of power. Stuart Gordon manages to take us into a maddening story where suspense is present, characters are likable (even West sometimes) and gore is at its best. Jeffrey Combs helps a lot, building a cold, science driven med student, and we can perceive a reflexion about the limits of medical experimentation (on humans or animals). Definitely a must see!

I can't exactly say it's in the tradition of Welles, Bergman, Fellini, or so forth, but I will happily call it a minor classic.Why?  It's funny.  Not campy, just plain funny.  The dialogue is sharp, the cast is wonderful (all around; a rarity in low-budget horror), the pacing and structure work smoothly, and the effects are, well, cheap, but somehow it just doesn't matter.  High praise to Jeffrey Combs, as West (That's West.  Herbert West.), who takes his place with Colin Clive as Dr. Frankenstein, Brian Donlevy as Professor Quatermass, Ernest Thesiger as Dr. Pretorius, and a few select others as one of the greatest mad scientists in history.  (Two of the film's funniest moments spring from West's highly inappropriate sense of humor.)  And also to Bruce Abbott, who engagingly holds his own as West's increasingly worried straight man.As West's behavior grows more and more hilariously irresponsible, his experiments go more and more out of control, and the film gets wilder and wilder, you just sit back in joy and watch the sparks fly.  The film travesties H. P. Lovecraft, who possibly never cracked a joke in his life, and in the process sideswipes every pulp/sci-fi/horror cliche in the book. (The climax of the film**************SLIGHT SPOILER******************takes the pulp cliche of the distressed heroine's fate worse than death to a level that has to be seen to be believed, and then smartly one-ups it.)**************END OF SPOILER******************Obviously, those who have a problem with gore may wish to avoid this film, though I may say that the bloodshed, for all its explicitness, becomes pretty hard to take seriously.In any case, this film makes me happy.

Although some explored overt sexuality (Love at First Bite) and others explored outright mutilation (Andy Warhol's Frankenstein), none seemed to capture the campy nature of the two--This is where ReAnimator fills the gap perfectly and spoofed the medical/scientific/academic community with delicious abandon.

You'd think this is the one thing everyone gets right, but here it leaves a lot to be desired. Most of the time it sounds like the actors are talking from a distance away.

All of those combinations make Re-Animator one of my favorite Horror/Zombie movies,a Horror classic and Cult Classic.Based on H.P Lovecraft's story of the same name,Re-Animator tells the story Dan Cain(Bruce Abbott),a Miskatonic University Medical student who needs a roommate to share rent on a house. Dan gets a roommate in Herbert West(Jeffrey Combs),an eccentric scientist who has transferred to the university. However,Dan gets more than he bargained for when finds out Herbert West conducts bizarre science experiments using a serum chemical that brings people back from the dead and when Cain decides to help West the results are lead to chaos and insanity for Herbert and Dan.1985 was an amazing year for Zombie movies with the release of Horror/Zombie classics such as George A. Romero's Day Of The Dead,Dan O'Bannon's The Return Of The Living Dead and last but not least Stuart Gordan's Re-Animator,a brilliant and unforgettable Horror film that is not one of the best Horror films of the 1980s and of all-time band since it's 1985 release has gained a very strong Cult following. Right from the very beginning Re-Animator is an amazing Horror-Comedy that for it's 85 minutes gives viewers a terrific and memorable movie that is twisted and offbeat,weird and hilarious as well as gory,bloody and disgusting. Director Stuart Gordon takes the concept of amazing Horror classics such as Frankenstein(1931)and The Bride Of Frankenstein(1935)and takes the concept of bringing back the dead even further with Re-Animator. The genres Horror and Comedy are two sides of the same coin because both Horror and Comedy can get you to react either by making jump out of your seat or making you laugh and Re-Animator does both with such greatness and that's one of the reasons I love the film. On the Horror film side,Re-Animator doesn't rely on scares or suspense although the movie has some suspenseful scenes but on the blood and gore and when the blood and gore comes it never stops and the gore will disgust viewers. At the same time despite the blood and gore Re-Animator is never meant to be taken seriously because the movie has a manic and wild energy that makes you just forget about the gore. The Comedy and Humor in Re-Animator is hilarious and funny with a dark Comedic glee that is politically incorrect and matches the insanity that happens throughout the movie and it's the way the characters react to situations that are over the top and wild and when the horrific scenes become more horrifying you cannot help but laugh. Re-Animator is one of the best Horror-Comedies ever made and truly belongs in the great Horror sub genre known as Splat stick(a combination of blood,gore and over the top Comedy). Another thing that I also love about Re-Animator is that some of the dramatic moments and scenes have the look and feel of a Soap Opera like Days Of Our Lives or The Young And The Restless where each of the serious moments are so dramatic you just burst out laughing with joy. The main character Herbert West is one of greatest and truly most unforgettable characters in the history of Horror films and when you see him the first time in the beginning you are aware that West is very insane insane to the point where he only cares about bringing back the dead in such an obsessive way which make Herbert West funny in a twisted way. Despite the chaos and damage West is causing he continues to work on his experiments with craziness and determination and that is one of the things that makes Herbert West so iconic,funny and is a great character that you will never live on forever. The ending of Re-Animator is terrific and memorable because there is blood,gore and plenty of laughs,shocks and surprises that will stick with the viewer. A classic ending to a great film.The cast is great. Jeffrey Combs is excellent and iconic as Herbert West,with Combs being insane and delightfully over the top. Bruce Abbott is terrific as Dan Cain,West's partner in crime. Barbara Crampton is amazing and beautiful as Megan Halsey,Dan's girlfriend. David Gale is fantastic as Dr. Carl Hill,a rival of West's. Robert Samspson is wonderful as Dean Halsey,Megan's Father.The direction by Stuart Gordan is amazing,with Gordon always moving the camera and giving the film a stylish look with a few tracking and long shots that reminded me of a Stanley Kubrick film. Great direction,Gordon.The score by Richard Band is outstanding and matches the tone of the film even though most of the score was ripped off from Bernard Herrmann's score in Psycho(1960). Great score,Band.The special make-up effects are outstanding,bloody and realistic and add to the film's greatness. Outstanding special effects.In final word,if you love Horror Films,Zombie films,Horror-Comedies or genre films in general,I highly suggest you watch Re-Animator,an excellent,hilarious and unforgettable Horror classic that you will never forget after you watch it. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

Cain has a spare room in his house, which he rents to the rather creepy new arrival at medical college in Herbert West. West has a strange air about him and rightly so since he has an obsession with challenging the accepted fact that death is presented as. West openly challenges the teachings of the very experienced Dr Hill on the subject of the brain and when/how it dies, causing some tense classroom exercises. However West's obsession does not end there and experimentations in Cain's basement produce a certain amount of success but will only lead to terrible failure.I'm not a big horror fan but I do have a certain amount of OCD when it comes to watching films and when I saw this in the TV listings I realised that I had never seen it and decided to do so. I'm pretty sure that this gory affair is not Lovecraft had in mind when he wrote the story many decades ago, but this is what it is and I suppose it sort of fits in with the video nasty phrase that was around in this period. With this in mind it certainly does owe a debt to Evil Dead, not so much because it lifts anything from it but just that in concept it is similar. It does differ in humour though because, although some reviewers have said it is tongue in cheek I actually thought it did a good job of playing it as straight as possible and, although excessive in tone and gore, it is certainly not a comedy in the way that the Evil Dead films could be described. It is not a restrained chiller either so don't expect a ghost story but the straight playing does create a tension during the film that helps build to the gore, rather than the effects being the all.The effects are impressive even if they are dated now. Considering the budget it does all look very good, with the prosthetics working well (with the exception of that ridiculous cat &#150; although that is still a disturbing scene). The direction from Gordon is good and the camera moves well in a way that draws the viewer in. The lighting is also effective in some scenes, adding to the creepy feel. The cast surprised me by how good they actually were &#150; not brilliant of course but for a low-budget horror. Combs does a great turn in what some films would have seen hammy and unhinged &#150; instead he plays it aloof and detached, making him more creepy. Abbott channels Bruce Campbell in his turn but it does work as he mixes respect for and fear of, West and his work to good effect. Gale is a wonderful creation and convinces even in the final parts of the film; it is not his fault that he looks like Senator John Kerry, which I did find a little distracting. Sampson is solid while Crampton is a respectable blonde co-ed as required by the genre.Re-Animator is not a brilliant film but it is a good genre film. The effects have dated but still work to produce some watch through your fingers moments to compliment the overall sense of creepiness and doom that the film captures. Remade nowadays this film would just be about the body count so in a way it is a snapshot of a happier time in the genre and can still be enjoyed today.

After watching it for the first time, I must say that they are right, this movie deserves all the praise it receives and more. What Stuart Gordon achieves here, is a perfect mixture of horror and dark humor that also pays good homage to his idol, H. P. Lovecraft, writer of the source novel the movie is based on.Lovecraft's tale tells the story of a young student of medicine who happens to meet newcomer Herbert West, a student who has achieved what many had looked before the secret of giving life back to the dead. The unnamed narrator becomes West's partner and helps him in his experiments. However, West's own obsessive ambitions, and the problem of finding fresh bodies will become a serious problem for their investigations and a risk not only for their careers, but also for their lives.The film adaptation follows closely the main story, although with several changes to set the movie in the present. While Lovecraft's story spans over years in the life of West, Gordon sets his version completely in their time in Miskantonic University. Despite the changes, the movie retains that mix of dark humor and horror that the source novel had. Don't expect slapstick humor or a big splatter fest, the humor in Re-Animator is quite black and fits perfectly the cold personality of Dr. Herbert West.West is played by Jeffrey Combs and the unnamed narrator, named here Dan Cain, is played by Bruce Abbott. David Gale plays their teacher, Dr. Hill; and Barbara Crampton completes the cast as Dan's girlfriend Megan. Abbott is very good in the lead role, but is definitely Combs who completely owns the screen. Herbert West was his first important character and the one that gave him recognition among fans of horror. His performance is top-notch and still one of his best. He is a very underrated actor.Director Stuart Gordon makes the most of his limited budget, creating haunting and gory images as the dead are re-animated by West. The special effects are remarkably good, and look a lot better than most big budget movies. However, what separates this movie from others, is that the characters are very well-defined, and it is easy to sympathize with them, something very rare in low-budget horror films. The movie shows that Gordon put a lot of heart in this project, and that he truly likes the horror genre, the not-so-subtle nod to the music of Psycho (Rearranged by Richard Band) makes it apparent.Re-Animator definitely deserves all the praise it receives, and it is truly one of the best horror movies ever done. It is more than a mere scary movie, it is a very entertaining and rewarding experience that can be watched several times. 9/10 "}{"Title":"Death is just the beginning....","Date":"4 March 2006","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" I'm amazed Stuart Gordon isn't known by fans world wide as one of the horror greats, like John Carpenter, George Romero, Wes Craven, Joe Dante and David Croninberg.

Lovecraft fans will instantly see that fact that the film strays far away from the set of events in the original short story, but the core idea is the same and the feel of Lovecraft is present throughout the film. Especially in the climax. The short story has a real kicker of an ending and seeing that this is an updated (and campy) version the viewer is likely to wonder what director Stuart Gordon has in stock for his version, but rest assured it's there. It lacks the overall nightmarish background tone of Lovecrafts original story, but with the given resources it's fantastic.Then there is Jeffery Combs who plays West with an eerie perfection and it is hard to imagine anyone else in the role. He flawlessly embodies West's obsession though, the one real strike against the film, is that it could have presented some hints as to why West is on such and obsessive path. From Comb's performance it is not hard to believe West as an obsessive character, but given the relative short runtime of the film, just over 85 minutes with both opening and closing credits, it really seems like that little extra bit could have been in there somewhere.But in the end this is a classic of horror cinema. 9/10Unrated, contains Horror violence/gore and gruesome imagery "},{"Title":"The most unique movie I have ever seen","Date":"10 July 2003","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":"  The best cult classic of our time in my opinion.

Having read most of Lovecraft's stories as a kid, I'd been extremely disappointed by the movie adaptions, which seemed to throw out everything that made a Lovecraft story *a Lovecraft story* in favor of typical Hollywoodisms. So when I went to see Re-Animator in the cinema, I was pretty much blown away to see a movie made by someone who obviously loved the stories himself. Ok, so it had a love interest and THAT SCENE, which Lovecraft probably couldn't even have imagined, let alone written, but somehow it really managed to capture the feel of the stories despite bringing them more up to date.It's a B-movie, some of the effects are kind of hokey, some of the action is so dark it's hard to see, but as a horror movie (as opposed to a scary movie, they're not necessarily the same) it works well, and the ending, while seemingly inevitable, was both unexpected and perfect. If you like 'Scream' you'll probably hate this movie, but if you love intelligent, bizarre horror or H.P. Lovecraft's stories, you'll probably love Re-Animator too.Incidentally, the DVD is nominally out of print, but lately a few copies have been appearing for sale at some of the Canadian online DVD stores.

I think fluids like pus and vomit gore are still better as real fake fluids than any CGI equivalent I have seen to date especially when they are dripping from an actor.Another thing I like is the wonderful score by Richard Band, a theme that builds in tension then decays into madness perfectly matching this filmI read the original Lovecraft story Herbert West - Re-Animator after watching this film and I was surprised to find that the film was toned down quite a lot from the book.

I usually wind up feeling like most classic horror films that are recommended or held in such high regard aren't good at all or are extremely overrated. This film is a lot of fun though. It's definitely got its campy qualities with a headless corpse stumbling around the third act of the film, but it doesn't feel out of place for a film built around a concoction that's injected into the brain to bring corpses back from the dead. The music, especially the opening theme, tends to get a bad wrap because it blatantly rips off (or pays homage, depending on how you look at it) the Psycho score. While the similarities are crystal clear once they're heard, I honestly didn't mind it. It's kind of hard to imagine this film with different music, so I have no complaints.The Herbert West role really fits Jeffrey Combs like a glove. His attraction to weird and quirky roles pretty much began with films like this one. As West's unusual personality is revealed throughout the film, you can't help but get a sense of uneasiness as his character traits unravel before your very eyes. The best example is when West brings Dan's cat Rufus back to life. After it's been killed for the second time, Dan is shocked to discover it's Rufus and turns to look at West. West points at the cat and tells Dan to, Look out! Dan quickly turns his attention back to poor Rufus, who's still lying there motionless. West begins to burst into maniacal laughter as Dan looks on in horror. With the upcoming remake on the horizon, it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role of Herbert West especially with Jeffrey Combs confirmed for a cameo.While Re-Animator could definitely be considered cheesy and campy at times, its strengths outweigh its flaws. The story is simple, but tends to unfold nicely and the acting is solid (David Gale as Dr. Hill is up for debate though). The film is pretty much exactly what you would expect a horror film to be like from the eighties; gory, cheesy, tons of nudity and sex, and a few creative twists along the way. And when it comes to horror, what else could you really ask for?

Even to the extent of my having to come here and say something. I really, really don't enjoy gore but only to some extent, and this was pretty far across my line. Wes Craven's Scream is one of my all time favorite movies and it, too, mostly because of the psychological aspects, not the gore.I thought this is more likely to entertain only big gore fans, but I was positively surprised that the critics were right. The film makers certainly did take it so way over the top, and none of the actors took the roles too seriously, that it seemed more comical than disturbing, and left me feeling very positively entertained.Someone once said that horror is close to humor. When something is too horrible, you laugh in order to protect yourself. Unfortunately that has happened to me only once before this film. It wasn't even a horror film, that one. Anyway, when that happens, there's a great gore movie, even if the psychological aspects are missing or thrown aside. And I think this movie is a good example of such. I doubt any of the things I saw in this film, can come haunting me.So, even I found myself laughing out loud - partly in defense, partly in a heartfelt way, for one when there is the chaos in the mortuary and one of them throw the decapitated head out of the door and the black guy just happens to walk by just then, looks at the head, then at the chaos and hurries away. It's one of those have-to-see-it-to-get-it moments. And when Dr. Hill was walking to the mortuary, holding his own head on a tray. There was just something too comical about those moments.Besides, Herbert Wsst is a wonderful character and the actor is just perfect. He alone makes the film very much worth watching.I even found myself feeling a bit disappointed, when the end credits rolled in. I would've gladly watched a bit more of this fine horror comedy. But I understand that any longer, it might have lost it's power. I don't think I want to watch this again though, as I really don't care for gore much. But I genuinely did enjoy this, this once.I warmly recommend this to any fan of horror and/or horror comedies - of course excluding those who are very passionately against gore, or very sensitive to it/easily disturbed.One last thing; Don't watch this as your first taste of horror. First off; there is some pretty twisted scenes in this film. Secondly; I think you should first get used to gore and then watch this film. Otherwise this might be a shocker and take a lot away of the enjoyability.

It was fun, very fun. The reason why we laugh at films like this is, i think, related with the fact that we understand the breaking of cinematic conventions. in other words, if i'd never seen any gore serious film before, this one would just sound silly. This means we have a comedy attached to a specific genre, and which plays with it. Well, we are given absolutely every element we are supposed to get from the genre zombies, lots of blood, graphic depictions of guts, the object woman, who necessarily has to loose her clothes along the way and be the catalyst of desire of basically everybody on the film (except the inventor). We are even given those elements in the right place, and order, and with the right weight, according to what we except from the genre. But we will just laugh at it, just as the filmmakers did making it. This film doesn't twist the genre (like the new Thirst, by Park Chan-Wook does), instead it turns it into a cartoon, and that's also a good experience.This re-animator has a special interest, basically and simply because it is well executed. Unlike a very vast majority of the guys who did these films, Stuart Gordon does have a cinematic eye. He cares for how every shot is constructed, and that ends up summing up to the experience. Again, in other words, the film matters as cinema, instead of just an artifact for blood gore lovers to appreciate how they modeled the intestine that gains life in the final scene. Some moments, intentionally ridiculous in their plot description, work incredibly funny because of how they were shot. The best example is a shot in which you get, on a single frame, half the naked body of the female protagonist. We see her breasts, being handled by the hands of the headless body. Standing next to the girl we see the head itself, in a platter, with gazes of pleasure! it's incredibly visual, so much that i am laughing just remembering that frame. Other than that, the fluidity of the camera helps all the way.So, in the end, this doesn't have the juice of those films that play, twist, and re-deliver a genre, instead it falls on a larger group of films which are hommages. This is a pretty decent one, and you certainly will laugh at it.My opinion 4/5 http//www.7eyes.wordpress.com "},{"Title":"a good horror/comedy movie","Date":"24 January 2010","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" A medical student returns from Austria after working in regenerative experiments with a well known scientist who died under mysterious circumstances.

First it's a cat, then it's a corpse. Of course, the dead are not at all happy about being brought back to life and take it out on the living.

Things quickly go from bad to worse, and this includes the reanimated head of an evil surgeon who covets Kane's girlfriend, Megan Halsey (Barbara Crampton), and wants West's discovery for his own. What a time this group must have had making this nasty but somehow lovable romp. Watch in particular for the reanimated cat attacking West and Kane, Megan's dad making a serious mistake while in the clutches of a naked reanimated corpse, and the surgeon's bloody head having some fun with the alluring but shrill Ms. Halsey.

Stuart Gordon's Re-Animator of 1985 is without any doubt one of the most wickedly entertaining films ever brought to screen, and no lover of Horror and Gore, no, no true lover of cinema could possibly consider missing it. H.P. Lovecraft is doubtlessly one of the greatest writers of Horror fiction (in my opinion, he is THE greatest besides Edgar Allan Poe), and even though Lovecraft adaptations are often far away from the actual literary model, they have often turned out to be brilliant films. Not less than three of Horror cinema's all-time greats have their origin in Lovecraft's mind and pen, namely Roger Corman's The Haunted Palace (starring Vincent Price) of 1964, Sam Raimi's Evil Dead of 1982, and this masterpiece. Re-Animator is, simply put, one of the greatest, most outrageously entertaining Horror films ever brought to screen. This is not least due to the brilliant performance of Jeffrey Combs, who doesn't play but IS Herbert West, and, of course due to director Stuart Gordon's brilliant sense of macabre humor, and his talent to make an ultra-gory Horror/Sci-Fi flick one of the most outrageously hilarious comedies ever.The film starts out with a delightfully macabre and witty scene, which I don't want to give away, and then really begins at the renowned medical University of Arham, Massachusets (Lovecraft's town for everything macabre), where the kind-hearted Dan (Bruce Abbott) is studying to become a doctor and working at the University clinic. Dan's life is well-regulated, in spite of the fact that he has to hide his relationship with the principal's sexy daughter Meg (Barbara Halsey). This all changes when a new student comes to town - Herbert West (Jeffrey Combs). West, who moves in with Dan, is dedicated enough to constantly question the methods of his sleazy professor Dr. Carl Hill (David Gale). He is also obsessed with the resurrection of the dead... I don't want to spoil anything, so my plot description ends at this point, but I can assure that it is getting extremely gory and even more fun. Jeffrey Combs was born to play the role of Herbert West. Combs is a great actor who has played many other memorable roles, but the role of Herbert West is the one he will always be remembered for, simply because he IS Herbert West. Combs is brilliant in the role, and there is simply no other actor imaginable to play the character. David Gale is nothing short of brilliance either in his portrayal of the sleazy scumbag Dr. Hill. Bruce Abbott makes fits very well in the role of the good guy and the beautiful Barbara Crampton is absolutely wonderful (and sexy!) in the female lead. The extreme gore-scenes are outstandingly made. Never has gore looked so good and yet so outrageously funny. Gordon's outstanding direction, the settings, editing and camera work and the awesome score only increase this impression. I could go on praising Re-Animator forever, but I'll just give and advice In case you have not seen this yet, get it and do so immediately! I've seen the film multiple times and it gets more awesome with each viewing.

During that time, horror cinema was overridden with either lame slasher flicks (such as Freddy and Jason and all their crop) or bad horror-comedies (I never saw the appeal of Return of the Living Dead). During this period, there were two combinations of gory horror and comedy that really seemed to nail the concept. One was Evil Dead 2. Even better was the other one, Re-Animator. Re-Animator's sense of humor comes from knowingly over-the-top camp opposed to cheap in-jokes. The cast never winks at the camera, which is what makes this combination so effective. Also, the horror sequences themselves are quite intense, directed with a sense of utmost ferocity.In addition to being both funny and scary, this is a pretty well made film. Bruce Abbott is given a pretty dull role but does what he can with it and Barbara Crampton is quite adequate in what her role requires - laying around looking absolutely beautiful. Much more memorable than either of those two are David Gale and of course Jeffrey Combs. Gale is quite unnerving as the creepy and evil mad doctor who steals Herbert West's (Jeffrey Combs) ideas. As Herbert West, Jeffrey Combs is the true revelation. Its no wonder he went on to become a major b-movie player. The direction by Stuart Gordon keeps everything moving at a quick pace, and he knows primarily when to play a scene for laughs or scares. Re-Animator is a classic for a reason. Its one of the 80s finest low-budget films and a true cult classic. (9/10) "},{"Title":"What's to say?

It can be loved by the audience and disliked by critics. George Romero was asked once why has he chosen to restrict his career to a genre not favored by critics. His answer was that he never saw himself as working in a genre other than horror.Many typical slasher movies have been released where a bunch of teenagers get it. Most of these films got mixed with the rest of the crowd of nonsense horror and forgotten. In 1985 along came re-animator a horror film so unique, bizarre and disturbing it just had to become a classic. From my point of view the brilliance of re-animator lies not in its over-the-top gore or its black humor but in the plot. Scientists have always been interested in prolonging life. Think about the pseudoscience called alchemy, (chemistry's predecessor) the main objective of an alchemist was inventing an elixir that prolonged life indefinitely. Re-animator is the impersonation of this idea. Conquering death has been in the minds of people since the dawn of time.As far as the gore goes well, I see it as the disastrous consequences of playing God. While Dr Hill (I think that's his name) was alive he did not pursue Barbara due to society's norms and rules. Herbert West's so called re-agent brought back his ID (demand for gratification) not the ego (social conscience), thus turning him into a monster.It is not very clear who the villain is in re-animator. Herbert West is simply an obsessed scientist who wishes to help humanity. All that is inhumane about his actions is the single premeditated murder of Dr Hill, who then becomes the actual villain.William Friedkin, the director of the exorcist said that a film should inspire and provoke you, which is exactly what re-animator does through its disturbing nudity and gore and the quite big content of accurate science. Theoretically it would be possible to bring somebody back to life by restarting the body's chemical reactions.10/10 for it's underlying sophistication, it's uniqueness and because it reminds us of something very simple Death can only be prolonged to a certain degree, it can't be beaten or avoided.

Re-Animator is a very goofy film and is not exactly intelligent either. I'm not going to pretend that Re-Animator is well made either because it is far from a well made film. Yet there is something very cool about Re-Animator maybe the fact that the very fake gore looks so funny and I can respect the level of creativity because this was before special-effects were filling up the market. Re-Animator is a very iconic film and has a strange nerdy feel throughout it's short running time.Re-Animator has this great B movie feel to it, think Evil Dead (a better film by the way) but with scientists. The movie is very well known for it's level gore, which is definitely is, yet the gore is very fake and so funny that you won't be as disgusted as you would be if it wasn't comic. I think it is great that Re-Animator has so much comedy in it and the whole detached head and body scene is so imaginative and irresistibly hilarious. Still the film keeps you very entertained and provides a lot of intense scenes of clumsy science. Re-Animator feels somewhat like a cartoon that's not sure if it wants to shock you or make you sit back rolling around in hysterics. The film is not scary, but is creepy at certain times and you'll always know what's going to happen next.The acting is another thing that makes the film so funny and the fact that almost every line uttered is cheesy brilliance. I love the way all the actors actually seem very attached to their roles, yet you know they are probably taking the whole thing as a joke. There's something very amusing about watching film basically about an inept scientist who tries to create a cure for death. Not only does the film manage to just shock you from the opening scene, it also manages to hold up the atmosphere throughout the film. The film definitely is an all rounder in the technical categories even if it does look very cheap. The make up is highly detailed and shows a lot of time and effort. At least Re Animator has a level of intelligent direction to it.Being the kind of movie lover who's not a great fan of horror films and tries to avoid them because of the often awful repetitiveness. If you can except that really Re-Animator is a comedy and not a gore fest then you might overlook some of the more intense sequences as highly amusing examples of kitchen gore. Yes Re-Animator is dumb, yes Re-Animator is over the top and yes Re-Animator has a certain style and guilty pleasure level to it.

But it's definitely not for everybody, as Gore-don's effects take center stage in an entertaining zombie free-for-all.In a deliciously over-the-top role, Jeffrey Combs is Herbert West, eccentric and dedicated medical student and the Re-Animator of the title, who as the film opens, has already resurrected his first corpse and I must say, it's literally eye-popping. Ewe.We next find ourselves at a prestigious medical school, and student Dan Cain (Bruce Abbott) has been partnered up with new student West, who has brought his reanimation serum with him. He presents his neon-green miracle potion to the disbelieving Dan, but finds himself breaking into the morgue to resurrect dead bodies.As with any horror movie of this caliber, there has to be a bad guy, and in this case it's Dr. Hill (David Gale), who experiences first-hand the effects of West's serum (the head on the box cover art belongs to him). Hill eventually sets his sights on Dan's lovely blonde girlfriend Megan (Barbara Crampton, exposing enough flesh here for two Re-Animators). Hill steals West's serum and more dead rise, putting West and Dan in a nasty, gory predicament.I think it's safe to conclude that Re-Animator doesn't play, and neither does its director. Gordon keeps the laughs and gore aplenty, allowing even the most cynical to walk away with something, not just a vomit bag (yes, it's that gross). The performers are so-so, but not Combs as Herbert West. He's all over the place, so to speak, in a role that he seems custom-ready for. With his nerdy glasses, pale face and fidgety voice pattern, you'd never guess he has a penchant for raising the dead.Here is a true horror classic from filmmakers who know their stuff about splatter flicks.

You have to look into finding this one out (that, or pay attention to the movie conversation between Spacey and Bentley in American Beauty when stoned).

Turns out it works, first on a cat, then on something... else, like say a huge muscle man in a morgue! From here on its turns into a match of wills - Herbert West versus the vindictive and power hungry Dr. Carl Hill, who wants nothing but to take West's formula - and then when dead and a severed head, to create a zombie army that only he can control through lobotomies... yeah, still crazy?

It's a splatter-fest, coupling the ribald gore of a B (or Z) grade horror movie with some of the dread one maybe found in the original Lovecraft story. Some of the movie is just too bizarre and weird to totally qualify as comedy, or some of it just so much that it goes even further (or at least toe-to-toe) than its other 1985 zombie-comedy, Return of the Living Dead. But probably the best assets to make it crazy-funny as opposed to just crazy is David Gale as Carl Hill (mostly after he's a severed head and body, doing more campy takes than one could ever ask for outside of Bela Lugosi), and Jeffrey Combs as Herbert West. Combs is so good here at projecting this determined, insane but almost admirably passionate *scientists* that it's a shame then he only has one other stand-out performance - as a crazy agent in the Frighteners.Sure, the acting by the two leads isn't always at its best from Bruce Abbott (good at one stare, not so much on dialog except for a few key scenes) or Barbara Crampton (a good screamer and a sexy body, but also on par with Abbott for talent), but this is the least thing to worry about as they're supposed to be the bland-leads. What makes the film so incredible and enduring since its release is its attention to real horror - the body that is just there in the background BOLTS UP oh no! - and some real insane comedy.

He gets most of the best lines, such as when Dan yells at him when a hysterical Meg has found her pet cat, Rufus, in West's fridge with a broken neck, that if he found the cat that way as he claimed, West could have left a note. A note saying what? 'Dan cat dead. Details later'? he dryly replies.Re-Animator is the kind of film that doesn't revel in its goriness; it completely depends on it. It's probably not something that fans of the original Lovecraft story would appreciate, nor should they; the film version is so far removed from the source material that the title is practically the only thing establishing a connection. I think that, for maximum viewing pleasure, you just have to go with the flow and leave behind any notions of good taste or decent principles and immerse yourself in pure horror delight.Overall rating 8 out of 10.

It has everything that I would have loved, and lots of it. Now, a bit older, I can still appreciate it for what it is, but the novelty of it all is gone.I'm not sure if I have read the specific Lovecraft story this is based on, but as far as I can understand, it moves away from Lovecraft's storyline. Because I don't know how the original story goes, I can't say this for sure, but It feels like they stuck to the story a while, but then got too caught up in having fun with ideas for scenes. It's like the filmmakers were let loose on a set with SFX-people, trying to think how they could do as much sick/fun things as possible. Which leads to some interesting situation, but it all feels very engineered. The plot built up in the first act(s) of the movie is still there in the background, but they miss the chance they had at making a compelling story. All the characters get caught up in the gore and he violence (and the slapstick), leading to a blood filled finale.What would I have preferred? Well, the SFX is fun, so I'm not really complaining about it. But I wish they had followed more up on the conflicts between the young idealistic scientist and the older, cheating one. It's there throughout the movie, but at one point you realize that it's just there to justify hostility. It also appears that some parts of the plot were removed, because the ending kind of does not make sense. How is one character able to control some of the re-animated? (according to wikipedia, it's explained in some cut scenes) Anyway, if you're a younger kid, you're gonna love this.

Lovecraft novella Herbert West&#x96; Reanimator, this classic mid-80s horror is both old-fashioned and new. It takes a work of period literature &#x96; about a grave-robbing doctor restarting dead human beings as if they were machines &#x96; and transplants it to a modern-day mad scientist workshop, effectively reinvigorating the zombie genre. With its unnatural lighting, crooked angles and melodramatic outbursts, Re-Animator has the style of cautionary 50s sci-fi. Except much, much gorier.Jeffrey Combs plays West, whom we meet grappling with one Dr Hans Gruber (that's right). It turns out that West wasn't killing Gruber; he was bringing him back to life with the help of a special serum. West flees to New England, where he moves in with Dan (Bruce Abbott), a trainee surgeon, and his girlfriend Megan (scream queen Barbara Crampton). West soon gets to work resurrecting dead animals, but his sights are set on human reanimation. Appealing to his curiosity and his ego &#x96; and despite the warnings of Megan &#x96; West convinces Dan to assist him, gaining access to the morgue. Meanwhile, the scheming Dr Hill (David Gale) seeks to steal the serum and create a zombie army of his own. The movie is based mostly in a single set, the morgue, meaning most of the sub-$1m budget goes on spectacularly gruesome special makeup effects. This release is the Unrated version, meaning all the beheadings and disembowellings are here in all their 4K glory. It's safe to say Re-Animator features some of the most impressive and memorable gore effects of the decade. Tony Doublin's design for the headless Dr Hill is masterful. The scenes where Hill's disembodied head is psychically controlling his stumbling body are eye-poppingly gross and funny.The script is sharp, the plotting is tight, and the characters are well-rounded. Sure, the goodies aren't nearly as fun as the plotting puppeteers. But then, this isn't the kind of movie where you're expecting to feel fuzzy and consoled come the final freeze-frame. More satirical than David Cronenberg's The Fly but straighter than Frank Henenlotter's Frankenhooker, Re-Animator successfully finds the sweet spot between comedy and horror. This is thanks in large part to the universally good performances, chief of which is the possessed Combs, whose deranged scientist is hilarious and unique. There's talent on the other side of the camera, too. Richard Band's wonderful music is pure Psycho-era Bernard Herrman. And the producer is Brian Yuzna, whose directorial debut would be the fantastically grotesque Society, and who would direct the Re-Animator sequel in 1990. Bold characterisation, barking performances, timeless practical effects, efficient plotting and jet-black humour &#x96; not to mention considerable after-the-event reassessment &#x96; leaves Re-Animator a shoe-in for cult status. It even dares to ask big questions What is medical science for? Should we seek to cheat death entirely? And then it drowns such lofty concerns in a bucket of offal. "},{"Title":"The 4 genre movie","Date":"26 February 2016","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" Re-animator can be considered to be a part of many genres. It does meet the definition of a cult film, a horror film, a sci-fi film and even a comedy film. The movie has a somewhat similar plot to that of Frankenstein. But instead of creating a monster from virtual scratch, a young medical student named Jeffrey Combs is motivated to bring dead corpses back to life. He quickly becomes friends with another medical student, whose girlfriend's father just happens to be a doctor. The re- animations do not go well at first, the revived corpses are not able to think clearly and they try to kill him. This movie is has a solid R- rating and it is one of the most graphic and gory movies I have ever seen. This movie takes on gore like the movie The Evil Dead with the main goal of making it so gory that it is humorous. Jeffrey quickly moves from re-animating animals to re-animating people, even though they are not quite the same re-animated as they were when they were alive. The corpses are re-animated by injecting a needle with green serum into the back of the head, sometimes with highly violent results. Then the movie gets odd and humorous giving i it's cult and comedy rating. A re- animated corpse tries to rape a girl but his severed head cannot do it. The same corpse with the severed head tries to control it's body and it crashes into things. I did enjoy this movie, it was a very unique movie and it was very fun to watch. But however, I would not recommend this film to those who do not like graphic movies. The movie was a very pleasant surprise and it is very funny.

Few people coming to it would be unaware of that fact. It is not undeserving of its status in this regard.Jeffrey Combs is the absolutely perfect choice for Herbert West, or any Lovecraft character. He's small, intense, intelligent, pale, and apparently completely humourless and devoid of any human interest. He comes across as a pure scientist as Lovecraft's characters always were.He was so well cast, and this movie did such an admirable job of modernising a Lovecraft story - albeit with some alterations, such as a love interest (something you'd be hard pressed to find in the horror master's entire body of work) and a spooky, Manson-like professor - that it is hard to believe he made the misfire From Beyond, the next Combs- Gordon collaboration of another Lovecraft story. That one, based on a short story, was simply not suited to a feature film length, and so required more than just modernizing it had to be padded with garbage that spoilt the master's original work. That was not the case with Re-Animator, which was based on a novel, after all.Finally, a word about the tone I first saw Re-Animator coming from Peter Jackson's Brain Dead and Frank Henenlotter's movies. I expected a similar kind of horror-comedy and was disappointed. As far as I know, Stuart Gordon has never gone for comedy in any of his movies. This is not a problem in Re-Animator; it's goofy fun regardless. "},{"Title":"7 - Good","Date":"23 December 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" A classic comedy horror. It features a college roommate who is so naive and stubborn toward finding a discovery that he endangers everyone around him. He invents a serum that can re-animate the dead, but while it does successfully revive the dead, it also makes them erratic and violent. After a zombie nearly kills the gang, what's the solution? Of course, re-animate more people and repeat the same mistakes. Things get spooky when a beheaded professor discovers this potion - I'll just leave it at that. Re-animator is scary and thrilling but doesn't take itself too seriously either. There's plenty of gore and disturbing imagery to go around for everyone.

"},{"Title":"A-quality B movie","Date":"8 November 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" I first saw this in 1985 on opening day because I am an H. P. Lovecraft and Gothic horror fan. Read The Rats in the Walls, and if you like that, read on!The title music and graphics of The Re-Animator scream I am not just a horror movie, but also a Hitchcock-like thriller. Well, not quite. But it is a funky mix of thrill, slapstick, Freudian psychodrama, gore - and of course dark comedy, as in any good horror film, and in many Hitchcock films.Re-animator is really top-notch in the genre of over-the-top gore films. Even as a zombie film (we are re-animating the dead here) it is vastly superior to most zombie films (such as the sorry World War Z, for example). The film is almost perfect horror in so many ways, and has been beaten in the over- the-top horror category only by Peter Jackson's Dead Alive, which came out 7 years later. Jackson must have seen this and thought 'I can top that both on the Freudian psychodrama and the gore.' And so he did, but you've got to have a 'Vorbild.' (Sorry, Sigmund)So what's on offer? We have a great 4-note string theme from the opening that recurs throughout to announce that something yucky is about to happen. Shirley Walker's theme for Final Destination would be a more recent example of getting it just right.We have all-out gore as we plod to the inescapable conclusion at the end, but always with as much suspense as gore. Who can ever forget the black zombie cat set piece? Or a decapitated corpse giving tongue? (By the way, if the latter makes you nervous, do not watch this movie. It is R rated for the gore, and the director figured, what the hell, why not some sex and nudity while we're at it?)We have perfectly cast actors for each role, such as David Gale in a Christopher Lee-like role as a creepy brain surgeon with a lot of funding, or Jeffery Combs (who played blue Andorians on Star Trek) as a creepy medical student who think's he's surpassed his teachers in skill.Most importantly, we have loving detail in every scene, far beyond the usual horror film. Our hero (played by Bruce Abbott) has a sweat stain on his surgical gown when he wheels a dead patient to the morgue, after exercising hard to pump her chest to re-animate her the convention way. At a dinner, the Dean of Miskatonic Medical School fêtes David Gale for bringing in the biggest NSF grant the school has ever gotten. What-in-hell movie director or writer knows what an NSF grant is? When a skull gets sawed open during an anatomy lesson, tiny drops of blood dribble off the saw onto the surgical cart in a close-up. There are two peep holes in a doctor's bag carried by a headless zombie so its head hidden in the bag can direct it. And so much more. What this attention to detail does, is to maintain a sense of realism, and that in turn maintains a sense of suspense, despite the comically absurd plot. The plot is where this film is unable to transcend B territory, and must remain a B movie. The biggest fallacy of horror films is that people who should know better stay at the mercy of an improbable situation. Like a family staying in the haunted house after scary things happen, when any normal person would move out. Rarely, this fallacy is transcended, such as in Alien, where the characters really have no choice but to stay in the spaceship, weeks from any planetfall. Re-animator fails to transcend in that regard it is completely preposterous that a highly regarded medical student with the Dean's daughter as girlfriend takes a really creepy roommate when she says no. Or that said student will go along with the creep, when he finds his beloved cat dead in the refrigerator, to have the poor animal reanimated as a zombie flying around the basement and screeching like no cat ever has or will. Or that zombies will stumble around one minute then be agile enough to do laser-scalpel brain surgery the next. The characters far too easily accept the situations into which they are thrust, when they could easily escape. This is a necessary device to move B movie plots along quickly to the yucky action. And that's where Re-animator falls far short of Hitchcock's Psycho for example, where Bates' staying at the motel is amply explained by an Oedipal relationship with his dead mother, whereas other visitors suffer a rapid demise before they even know what's going on.But there is plenty of yucky action, suspense and dark humor in Re-animator. I realized just how good this film is recently I had seen it once in 1985 on opening day, and thought it was a blast. Yesterday I decided to see it again. Second impressions are often less flattering, but the moment I heard and saw the music, Dr. Gruber, the cat, Dr. Hill's head on a receipt spindle, it all came back crystal clear because my mind had refused to forget. It is a weird feeling when you think you have forgotten something, and then suddenly remember every detail just before it comes up. Thank you, Stuart Gordon (the director), even though your story does not have that 19th century macabre atmosphere of Poe and his disciple Lovecraft, upon whose ideas the film is loosely based.

It is a simple Frankenstein like story, small cast of characters which relationships among each other are worked out pretty well. Especially our 2 scientists and the lovely Megan were likable, people I liked to root for. Even Megan's father wasn't that bad after all. It's not overly gory, I would say it's the right dose of it.

Fantastic acting, tons of gore, little bits of humor sprinkled throughout, and a certain scene involving a severed head and a girl that just could never be shown in a movie these days. I loved all of it. The movie follows the story of Dan Cain, a medical student who is also in the tough position of dating the dean's daughter. Cain is soon joined by the strange Hubert West, a medical student from Switzerland, who has a serum that can bring the dead to life.The script is wonderfully written, with just the perfect amount of dark humor to lighten the mood just a little bit, but don't get me wrong this movie definitely had a dark tone even with it. I definitely have to give a shout out to the special effects department. A talking severed head, walking burn victims, and a zombie cat. Which all hold up to modern times CGI. With just some fake blood and some quick camera work they made a wonderful Dr. Hill. Another part of the movie that I really liked was the fact that I cared about the characters. In many horror/zombie movies I don't care if or when a character dies, because I don't feel a real attachment to them. The acting is what turned this around, the acting was impressive in every way. They allowed me to really get to know the characters and develop a sort of relationship with that you really don't find in movies of the same genre. The Re-Animator was also straight and to the point. With a run time of only 86 minutes there was plenty of time for action and little to none filler scenes. And boy will that ending keep you wondering what just happened??? Overall The Re-Animator easily gets a 10/10, it was just perfect in every way. Funny, scary, and gory.

A dismembered head trying to give fellatio to a naked, bound woman will forever be etched in my memory!Bruce Abbott plays the rather wooden lead, Dan Kane, a well meaning doctor who is roped in by Jeffrey Comb's Herbert West who is experimenting with a serum to bring the dead to life. Barbara Crampton plays the sexy girlfriend of Kane who is also the daughter of the hospital principal. David Gale plays a rival doctor who also wants to experiment in reviving the dead and has a sleazy eye on Crampton as well.The film in some ways makes little sense, dismembered bodies moving and attacking people.

It's truly amazing - in the most gruesome and terrible way possible.My first thought, as the film started, was that it looked like it was made on a surprisingly high budget - almost like a B-movie coming across like a blockbuster. Yes, the haircuts now look a little dated, but the storyline is pretty different and the actors all put in a better performance than you'd expect for an eighties horror film.A moody young surgeon joins a class of medical students. He believes he can bring dead bodies back to life. He teacher doesn't believe him. His teacher soon lives to regret that.Expect gore aplenty and bodies dropping like flies (and then standing up again). In this day and age, where Hollywood is remaking every vaguely successful film from yesteryear, I find it amazing that no one has got round to making this one yet. The plot is decent enough so that you'd probably not have seen anything like it before (despite the multitude of zombie movies flowing across the screen).If you like horror, if you like gore, if you like zombies or just cheesy eighties movies in general, you really have to watch this.

A lot i said about Re- animator and I admit, it's a classic but have seen it the other day it's still watchable for the effects but in the beginning it moves slowly towards the point of no return for Herbert West (Jeffrey Combs). It's also typical for that era that it was heavily cut and a few versions are out there. The shortest version is the 82 minutes with most of the gore intact but here and there they cut out the nudity and some conversations. There's also a 96 minute version that is supposed to be the full uncut version but watch out for the 86 minute version which is the best version. It's the director's cut and what have been cut are some conversations going on. Nothing of nudity or gore is left out so it's better to pick up that version then the 96 minute version. But what makes it the hunt worthy is the fact that one scene is left out of all available prints and is searched by collectors. It's the deleted scene were Megan Halsey (Barbara Crampton) is supposed to be death and is shown to her father and Dr. Hill to be injected by the serum to reanimate her by her lover. It's a scene of a few minutes were Barbara goes naked and screams a lot and close-ups are shown of her breasts. So far I know only the Spanish Blu Ray and the old DVD version with the syringe contained do show that particular scene. It doesn't make sense at all, go figure it out that your daughter goes naked before you and as a father you are enjoying that vision. It's weird and was cut out of all prints. Still, Barbara goes full frontal at the operation table with the gory and sexual scene with the head of Dr. Hill watching her and licking her nipples and almost goes lickety-clit but West enters to avoid that scene. In the beginning it's a bit of a joke with the cat being reanimated and attacking West. But it's really towards the end when West goes berserk and do kill Dr. Hill (David Gale) and beheads him with a shovel that Reanimator becomes gory. I was even surprised by the amount of male and female full frontal nudity that it contains. Some parts do look funny but the performance of David Gale gives this flick a special atmosphere. When he's still alive and is talking and hypnotizing West and Megan (not in the 86 minute version) it do gets creepy. Jeffrey Combs is okay but you can see that the combination of Combs and Crampton do works which went on in From Beyond (1986).Still, it's a must see horror flick that do have some black comedy scene's like in The Evil Dead (1981). Just watch the arm in the elevator with Megan. If you can go through the slow moving beginning and can stand gore and fun then pick this up. I would recommend the Spanish edition, it has all versions and the famous deleted scene and the soundtrack and the 86 minute in HD format.Gore 3/5 Nudity 2/5 Effects 4/5 Story 4/5 Comedy 1/5 "},{"Title":"Brilliant tongue-in-cheek horror","Date":"4 December 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" Weird Doctor does weird experiments in Switzerland, comes to America, teams up and moves in with colleague, experiments in the basement, re-animates dead things!

But at the same time, it lacks the beauty and eloquence of H.P. Lovecraft's original story, Herbert West--Re-Animator. The modern, 1980's setting seems odd and a bit awkward. West would be much more at home in the world around the nineteen-teens and twenties, when the original story was written and set.Lovecraft's works are so much more than just shocking tales and monster stories. They're beautiful and engaging, thrilling and--not just gory, but genuinely morbid in the truest sense of the world; a sense that seems to have been largely lost in the world of modern horror.Re-Animator possesses none of the first three qualities. It does have some true morbidity--but only in the very small parts wherein it remains true to the source material.To sum up This is a good, entertaining movie, if you don't mind some gore. It's definitely worth watching. But it's the kind of movie you watch one night and then the next night forget about. It's far from worthy of cult classic status.

I didn't not like it, but it's not gonna make my top ten horror/spoofs anytime soon.  Possible SpoilersThe first element that prominently stuck out in my mind was the Re-Animator theme music which takes Bernard Herrmann's classic Psycho theme and remixes it.  Though the theme itself is cute, it came as a very sudden and unwelcomed blow hearing so much of Herrmann's Psycho theme come up.  To me it tried too hard to pay homage and wound up rubbing me the wrong way. Then again, I am biased towards Herrmann's score in the sense that I feel it's groundbreaking . . . but I'm sick of hearing spin offs/rip offs.  Maybe I'll warm up to it eventually.The next element is a positive one.  Jeffrey Combs as Herbert West simply rocks.  There's been too many films featuring mad-scientists, some good, most bad, and very, very few carry a remotely convincing scientist.  Plot absurdities aside, Herbert West is one of the few fictional scientists that carried a sense of genuine conviction about his work.  The mad scientist cliché that's prominent in all our minds features a researcher who clearly has the insane part down, but when it comes to them actually believing in their work they're just reciting lines.  Despite how implausible and improbably the plot is, and how inaccurate and impossible the things are that West spews . . . I found myself wanting to suspend my disbelief for the film's sake.(spoiler) Part of that, I believe, has to do with this next bit of praise. West, in a dark and twisted way, is still a protagonist.  You never find out some deep dark alterior motive nor does West truly ever become insane in the traditional sense.  His intentions in the film are always pure and admirable. . . and the premise of the film is not about him losing it.  Not at all. The film is about West unable to explore his field in anything but subpar conditions with outside forces making things difficult at every turn a basement laboratory, school politics, and the threat of his work being stolen--in other words, outside forces forever permit his experiments to go out of control.  If he had a decent working conditions and a grant you could almost believe he'd succeed and there would be no movie nor death. (/spoiler)The dark comedy aspect of the film didn't quite seem right to me.  Granted several parts were humorous as well as disgusting, but there were too many instances where I felt the events on screen came across as too forced and corny to really make me laugh . . . most notably, the professor who kept getting 'hypnosis/mind power' lighting, camera angles, and monotones.

Most fail because they cannot project the true depth and imagery that Lovecraft invokes, on paper, to the big screen. This one comes very close. The contemporary setting is very nice. If they set this in the 30's or something, although that would have been interesting, I think it would have failed for the Horror/Science Fiction viewer.What succeeds? The depth of Herbert West's insanity and quest to re-animate the living, and the other characters fill in rather nice. Lovecraft was not known for witty banter between characters, so this script was done rather well. What didn't work The sleaze of it all. Sex has it's place, but not in this film. Barbara Crampton is lovely, but there was no need for the angle at the end. Oh, well.....Gordon did come from Theatre. Good film, overall.

I enjoyed the story and I did find it creepy. By now I should come to realize that good stories don't always translate into good movies especially in this case. If the producers of this film followed the story word for word as it was written originally,then this film would have been a real shocker and a real horror movie instead of a comedy. Unless of course this story was meant to be a travesty or parody of the original tale as written by Lovecraft. In that case then I have to rate it better as a satire. My advice for those who see this movie is not to read the story by H.P. Lovecraft before viewing it. That way you will save yourself some disappointment and you might even enjoy this well made travesty alot better.

I can't express how much I love this movie! While it is not very faithful to Lovecraft's short story, it certainly stands on its own merits. It is filled with the type of humorous gore and violence you expect from low-budget 80's flicks, yet it goes deeper than just a cheap thrill. Whether or not the film is intended to evoke existential questions, it succeeds in doing so by forcing the viewer to ask what happens to the body/mind after death. What are the limitations of science and the modern quest for immortality? Are we merely ghosts inhabiting fleshly machines, and if so, what happens when the machine has an existence apart from the ghost? This movie was actually the basis of a paper I wrote for my Religion and Film class in college, and I highly recommend it to both the horror fan and the amateur philosopher. Even if you don't remember the questions it evokes, you'll remember the what the headless zombie has a taste for!

Whereas for example Brain Dead and Bad Taste, and the Evil Dead were excellently shot (especially the experimental filming by Sam Raimi in Evil Dead), Re-animator's filming is more average, giving nothing extra to the film.Why should you watch it? If you are a splatter-fan it has plenty of gore and some interesting dissectional scenes. It's funny, though it doesn't come close to neither of the three above mentioned films. Not being scary, the sole reason for watching the film are the splatter-scenes. Other than that, the movie gave me nothing.

This one is astonishing in how intensely it engages us. Stuart Gordon, the director, keeps things tight. His film is slightly under 90 minutes long, and filmed in a manner that seems low-rent yet grandly alive and colourful. The scientific conversations don't throw lingo around without respect for the audience's intelligence; they flow logically, in a manner we can follow, while delivering on the level of junk science bluffing. The screenplay is wise to use a certain number of characters and locations for the action sequences; rather than hordes of faceless zombies coming at us, we've got our bearings.Richard Band's music is such an obvious rip-off of Bernard Hermann's Psycho score that from the opening moments we both get a feeling of familiarity and smile along with the filmmakers' crafty sense of humour. The ending is such a deliciously sinister tease, played so well by otherwise straight-laced leading man Bruce Abbott, that as the credits roll we're already hungry for the sequel.Another great performance comes from Jeffrey Combs, as Herbert West, the re-animator himself. Combs makes parts of his face and voice flat, while other parts go over-the-top, and he reminds us there are few purer pleasures than watching a well-played mad scientist.

The script is very effective and the relationship between the two leading characters &#150; Herbert West and Dan Caine &#150; makes it even stronger. At first West and Caine are antagonistic characters, but Caine easily gets dragged into his flatmate's madness despite the fact he's disgusted by West's experiments. Therefore the two guys rapidly become complementary and once the duo is formed, the film progressively gets wild and all the characters eventually have to dive into an ocean of guts and blood. What I especially like about this film is also the fact that it was meant to really frighten and shock the audience, and that is why it is such a good film. There is no parasitic humour but only very black humour from time to time. The numerous gore effects are quite realistic and impressive. Lastly, the ending is totally paroxystic, extravagant and NOT happy at all. So go and fetch the cassette or DVD if you haven't seen this masterpiece yet &#150; and if you don't mind spending some time with blood-spitting walking corpses, tortured cats and decapitated mad scientists!

Skip it if you're squeamish, though--trust me on this.The plot is taken (loosely) from an HP Lovecraft tale, Herbert West, Re-animator. The taglines kinda say it all. Dan Cain is a young medical student dating the Dean's daughter, who takes in a roomer and meets up with West, brilliantly played by Jeffrey Combs. West has discovered a reagent that will bring the dead back to life, except the serum still needs lots of work. When the dead people wake up, they do not seem happy at all to be brought back, and in fact have the tempermant of a grizzly bear on PCP. Added to the mix is the creepy Dr. Hill (who looks like an uglier, way creepier version of James Woods), who clashes with West and also has an icky obsession with Dean Halsey's daughter. (the attraction results in the movie's most outrageous scene that I'm sure you've heard about, which gives new meaning to a slang term for oral sex that..well, you'll figure it out).This movie is scary, gory, original, and above all, lots of fun. Just when you think it can't get any more over-the-top, it does. Combs steals the show as West, who looks like a cartoon version of a brainy young scientist with huge hornrimmed glasses. I appreciate his performance more each time I view the movie. He gets most of the best lines, such as when--SLIGHT SPOILER WARNING, though you'll see it coming a mile away-- Dan yells at him when a hysterical Meg has found her pet cat, Rufus, in West's fridge with a broken neck, that if he found the cat that way as he claimed, West could have left a note. A note saying what? 'Dan cat dead. Details later'? he dryly replies.Stuart Gordon made other great movies later on such as From Beyond and The Pit and the Pendulum (also with Combs) but he never topped this underrated, underseen gem.A word of caution-make sure you are renting the unrated version, as the R version has most of the gore cut out and the last 20 great minutes reduced to 5 or so. The R rated version has some scenes not in the unrated one that you might find interesting if you are a big fan (I rented it by accident) but really, the unrated version is the way to go.

Lovecraft's story of Herbert West, Re-Animator.West is an arrogant young medical student who believes he's unlocked the secret to reanimating dead tissue, thanks to his glowing-green liquid known as Re-Agent. West, played by Jeffrey Combs, comes into the life of promising doctor-to-be Dan Cain (Bruce Abbott) and thoroughly changes his life for the worst, as bodies and body parts start to come to demonic life.This movie just goes to show us how well horror and comedy can coexist in the same film, although, of course, as one can imagine, the humour is largely of the very dark variety. Gordon and company - producer Brian Yuzna, and William J. Norris and Dennis Paoli, with whom he wrote the screenplay - know that sometimes the only way to deal with dark subject matter is to develop a sense of humour about it, and have great gleeful fun just completely crossing over the line, especially in the true show stopping scene involving leading lady Barbara Crampton (playing Dan's girlfriend Meg) and a lascivious severed head. Plentiful use of stage blood and outré gore effects are a highlight, with an eye popping apocalyptic finale in a morgue. Richard Band's music score is for the most part excellent, as is all of his work, even if that main theme admittedly sounds just too close to Bernard Herrmann's legendary Psycho theme. Genre pros such as Mac Ahlberg (cinematography) and Robert A. Burns (art direction) lend their talents, and the movie shot on the same sets as the previous year's The Terminator, even using some of the same crew members.The cast plays this to perfection, with Abbott as a great straight man to the manic intensity of Combs's flashy role and performance; Crampton is the real heart and moral centre of the story, as well as a prime visual attraction, showing off her fine body on more than one occasion. Combs is hilarious, getting just about all of the best, most memorable lines. David Gale is a smarmy delight as the nefarious Dr. Hill, a man so villainous that one automatically starts rooting for West, definitely the lesser of two evils. He continues stealing his scenes after something quite nasty happens to Hill. Robert Sampson, as stuffy Dean Halsey, Gerry Black as amiable security guard Mace, and the director's wife Carolyn Purdy-Gordon round out the main cast.The movie gets off to a rollicking start, and maintains its mad energy for a reasonable running time of 86 minutes. It marks one of the rare instances (for the time, anyway) when a movie of this sort was bravely released to theatres unrated, and it remains, as it always has been, a purely fun experience and a guaranteed crowd pleaser.Eight out of 10.

There are no winking-at-camera shenanigans here. Every actor in the film tackles it like it is a serious feature. This naturally makes the funny moments all the more hilarious and the gruesome stuff properly effective.Jeffrey Combs is of course quite brilliant as Herbert West. His interpretation has gone down in cinema history as one of the truly iconic horror characters. And it's easy to see how Combs forged a successful B-Movie career off the back of this.

It's unusual to see a low budget horror flick full of good acting but this is one of the things that sets Re-Animator apart from its peers. Of note too are the gory set-pieces. They are very well presented and used in many creative ways. The final zombie attack is a well orchestrated sequence, while the headless mad doctor is well conceived and presented. The moment when this character has a, shall we say, intimate moment with Barbara Crampton is certainly the most notorious moment in the film. But it's a hilarious one. So wrong, yet definitely inspired. Inspired is a generous way of describing the soundtrack. It was certainly 'inspired' by the Psycho theme. I do actually really like the version they use in this film, its upbeat revision of that famous piece of music fits the picture really well. I just seriously hope that the composer realized how blatantly obvious and derivative this music is though! This is overall a very accomplished movie. It's one of the top comedy-horror films out there without a doubt. There aren't really any weaknesses to speak of and it remains to this day a hugely entertaining picture.

(excerpt from H.P. Lovecraft's HERBERT WEST RE-ANIMATOR) Many believe this is the first description of the zombie most audiences are familiar with today. And that was written during the years 1921-22! Reading the full story, you can almost sense Lovecraft chuckling sardonically at certain points. In one incident, Herbert West brings a body back to life which proceeds to terrorize and injure people. West merely shoots the body again and concludes that the brain isn't fresh enough. In spirit and form, Stuart Gordon's movie captures grotesque moments like that. While the movie has a fair deal more comedy than the original short story, it fits with the material. Before ZOMBIELAND, there was FIDO. Before FIDO, there was SHAUN OF THE DEAD. Before SHAUN OF THE DEAD, there was RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD. Before RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD, there was DEAD ALIVE. And before DEAD ALIVE, there was RE-ANIMATOR. Each one of them are solid entries in the zombie comedy (or zomedy) genre. So much has been talked about this movie already, including the famous head scene. But I'd like to point out that before this movie, there was never a better mix of horror and humor (mostly sexual in this one.) It all ends in a glorious special effects finale that may have inspired Peter Jackson's similar finale. The undead make-up is still spectacular 25 years later. Watch it alone, if you dare! Watch it with friends, and you'll have a blast!

Re Animator is pure 80's horror at its very best.Jeffery Combs plays Dr. Herbert West, a grad student studying medicine, the brain in particular, at the fictitious Miskatonic University in Massachusetts. He previously studied in Switzerland with Dr. Gruber, who died under mysterious circumstances. Dr. West has developed a fluorescent green serum that when injected into the base of the brain can reanimate the dead. Dr. West follows in long line of Frankenstein like mad scientists who try to conquer death. West rents a room with the star student Dan, who is also dating the Dean's daughter Megan. Megan is by far the weakest of the actors and was probably only cast for her nude scenes, but hey it works. The other actors perform as expected while the real star of the show is the effects. The practical, before CGI ruined everything effects. The script wasn't written by Shakespeare, but it doesn't hurt the film. Did I mention how crazy the effects were!

A mad doctor needs to be appalling and amusing at the same time, and few actors get this better than Combs. I never really knew if I wanted him to live or die, so I was satisfied either way it went. The supporting cast is somewhat less impressive, but you just can't have it all I guess. The effects in this movie are devastatingly old school, they bring us the simple joy of say, a talking severed head. There are some really lovely scenes in here, some really creative moments. However, to me the movie has always felt like it never really uses its full potential. As the sequels have already shown, these zombies can do a lot more than merely throw people around or strangle them. They're just not that threatening here, they're pretty far from the unstoppable monsters seen in Evil Dead. Also the place where most of the horror happens is just too secluded, the hospital setting feels wasted. A hospital has hallways, run through them damn it. Still, this is a very fresh and clever horror flick, one of the 80s best.

Since Dan Cain (Bruce Abbott) is looking for an roommate for his rented house. Herbert decides to be his roommate but sooner than later, Dan discovers that Herbert can bring the dead back to life, thanks to a serum he has created. But his serum is questionable and most of the people or animals has come back to life has turned extremely violent. Dr. Carl Hill (The late David Gale) becomes curious of Herbert West's work and he is trying to find out, what kind of work, he is creating. But in the mind of Herbert West, nothing goes as planned.Directed by Stuart Gordon (Dolls, From Beyond, King of the Ants) made an fascinating, outrageous horror film that is also an wild black comedy. This is the first film directed by Gordon, which he is best known for directing theatre work for years. As Gordon once said Re-Animator is his Citizen Kane. Which Gordon never topped his first directorial debut. But there is three movies, i can think, he nearly topped Re-Animator was Fortress, Edmond and Stuck. The performances of this movie are extremely good, especially scene-stealing roles by Combs and the late Gale. Which they are hoots in their roles.The two-disc set from Anchor Bay. First DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.851) transfer and an strong DTS 5.1 Surround Sound (Also in Dolby Digital 5.1 and Dolby Surround 2.0). The DVD also includes two original running commentaries tracks, recorded for the LaserDisc edition. Commentary one is an intelligent commentary by the director Gordon. Commentary two is an amusing commentary track by the producer Brian Yuzna (The Bride of Re-Animator, Beyond Re-Animator, Return of the Living Dead 3), actorsCombs, Barbara Crampton, Robert Sampson and Abbott.Disc two has an new documentary that runs over 60 minutes. The documentary is titled Re-Animator Resurrectus with interviews from the cast & crew of the movie. This Disc also includes all the original special features from the Millennium Edition from Elite Entertainment. Like Interviews, Deleted Scene, Extended Scenes and more. Re-Animator has dated over the years but it is still extremely well done with fun performances and simple but effective special effects. The only thing is missing from the Millennium Edition is the isolated music score by Richard Band. Re-Animator is an excellent film that is nearly perfect for its time. No wonder why film critics and audiences, who seen it back in 1985 still loves this picture. Director Gordon has become an strong independent filmmaker over the years, Producer and Director Yunza is been producing B Movies for decades and actorCombs has become an cult horror star. Perphas this movie is not for all tastes but it is clever, darkly funny and never runs out of energy. Don't miss this one. Written by Paoli, William J. Norris and the Director.There is alternative version exists that runs 96 minutes and it is Rated R. This version adds some extended sequences (Which some are good) but it deleted some of the most memorable gore of the movie. Which this version (these days) is played only on Television. This is a one of a kind horror comedy. Perphas the best one ever made for its kind. (**** ½/*****).

This one take the eighties propensity for gore and latches on to a Lovecraft story. It is virtually unconnected to the original. I viewed it as a film loosely adapted. One needs to plod through an hour and a half gore, dismemberment, sadism, and so on. After a while, we allow this milieu to present itself in all its convoluted splendor. The characters are zealots. They are crazy and sadistic. They have no restraint and no compassion for anything. People's loved ones are killed and torn apart and beheaded and life goes on. Motivation goes out the window.

I had previously saw this movie once but fell asleep watching it about 15 or 20 minutes into it. So, when I picked it up I thought that it would bore me to death like it did the first time. How wonderfully wrong my assumption was.The movie was really good. From what I heard, it was one of the most accurate adaptations of Lovecraft's stories and now after viewing this movie, it makes me want to read the story it was based off of. There was plenty of gore and great creature/zombie effects and some amazing puppetry. The acting was so-so, but that wasn't why I watching it. It was also pretty campy in the style of Evil Dead; combining spoofy humor and real drama along with its overall horror atmosphere. There were points where I was laughing but also disgusted at the same time.What I especially love is how much it compares to Frankenstein and how it completely reworks the entire 'mad scientist' character arc. West is a very brilliant and very driven man whose intentions are for a good purpose but his work has driven him to become unstable, his sanity is diminishing and he lacks any respect for life and death, so is he an anti-hero, hero or villain?It came to my attention that when I first tried to watching this movie, it was around 3am and I was very tired.

People assume because of their low budgets, un-well known actors and fairly unknown directors that they're going to be bad. This, and so many other cult films from the 1980s prove this theory wrong. With a budget of less than a million, director Stuart Gordon pulls of a competent, well acted and written, funny, occasionally scary, and always entertaining flick. This one will be remembered years from now, and over 20 years after it's release, it still has a large cult following!Dr. Herbert West (Jeffrey Combs) has created a new serum that if injected into the brain after death, will bring the dead back to life. West ends up renting a room from fellow doctor Daniel Cain (Bruce Abbott) and Daniel's girlfriend Megan (Barbara Crampton). Daniel ends up finding about West's serum after a mishap with their cat, and soon they end up testing it at the morgue. This ends in a reanimation with terrifying results, and the realization that bringing humans back to life does not mean that they will be the same as before they died.Really, this movie cannot be classified as horror. It has a spooky setting, and the occasional jump scene, but more than anything this is a comedy. The main character, Herbert West, is an accumulation of clichés from every other mad scientist in the horror genre. The action scenes are so over the top, they're hilarious. This movie is purposefully funnier than it is scary, and this is really a comedy. It can be compared to another cult classic that came out a few years later, Evil Dead 2, in it's morbid slapstick humor.The actors are all convincing. Jeffrey Combs is quite good at being menacing while doing nothing...he's rather creepy in the role. Bruce Abbott seems like an everyman, and plays it well. He's the underdog hero. Barbara Crampton is a nice love interest for him, and David Gale portrays an interesting semi-dead villain.Some of the best scenes, are the most ridiculous. The actors give a deadpan serious performance as silliness ensues, and where it could make it seem like these are good actors in a crummy movie, it instead feels like a tongue in cheek horror film. In one scene a zombie cat attacks, and it's clearly a cheap puppet, but these guys play it off like this is one frightening little feline. Another scene involves a decapitated body's large intestine flying out and choking a character while the rest of the body parts jump up and down. It's so ridiculous, but also so perfect.This comedy horror film is likely to entertain. It has memorable characters, slapstick violence, and for all you lovers of the human body, a lot of full frontal nudity from both sexes. To go along with the film we have a very lush musical score by Richard Band, the man behind the amazing music from the not so amazing Troll. In the end, this is an entertaining film with enough gore to please fans of the macabre.My rating *** 1/2 out of ****. 87 mins. R for strong violence, sexuality, and nudity.

For me however (and a lot of other people) such things often work to this film's advantage. The way this occurs is through Re-Animator's self-awareness that is present throughout most the film, acknowledging that it isn't necessarily something to be taken seriously and as a result, such flaws make the film brilliant fun to watch. Oh and when I mentioned bad performances, I wasn't including Combs- how could I? Without him, Re-Animator wouldn't be as comically animated as it is. For b-movie horror and gore fans, this is a must.

Needless to say, I finally picked it up.. and was blown away. Jeffrey Combs was AMAZING. Even in such a twisted film, his character is highly believable. I always shrugged it off when they compared him to Bruce Campbell, but he really is a phenomenal B-actor. The storyline is nothing special, but I always thought plot should never be a huge factor in these movies. It's good for what it is. Now, to the most important factor of the movie, what makes it so great, and the reason for it's cult status; the gore! I'm a huge fan of low budget splatter gore, I think it's a true art form.

Herbert kills Dr. Hill, via decapitation & re-animates Dr. Hill's severed head in a dish, using the re-animation fluid & success! Unlike Herbert's previous subjects, Dr. Hill returns non violent & retains all of his memories & can communicate verbally! the problem? He's just as evil as ever & determined to have the formula more than ever now! Using his ability to hypnotize & control minds, he revives his body to knock Herbert out & then re-animates a series of corpses in the school morgue to do his bidding, which includes abducting Dan's fiancée Meagan, whom we learn throughout the film, he has an unhealthy obsession with her, that is down right terrifying. When Dan & Herbert attempt to rescue her, they find that getting into the morgue to stop Hill is an easy plan, but executing it will be anything but, leading to an all out blood splattered, body exploding, crushed head & human intestine attacking fight between the living & the living dead!RE-ANIMATOR has to be beyond a shadow of a doubt, one of the top best 100 horror movies ever made! It's so over the top & gory that out has to be seen in order to be believed! Despite it's low budget origins, RE-ANIMATOR is one of the very few 1980's horror movies that has really good acting. Each actor makes their character all that more special & interesting & director STUART GORDON proves he is a horror director to watch out for, as he pulls out all the stops & creates one of the goriest horror movies in history! The film, which is loosely based on a six part serial by horror author H.P. LOVECRAFT, is a real treat for die hard horror & gore fans & is filled with many darkly comical moments. The story itself, is really just a modern day remake of the classic Frankenstein tale but is a lot of fun. The score by RICHARD BAND is really good, but it I liked it better when it was used in PSYCHO (1960) that's right, despite Band's claims, this score is swiped from PSYCHO, only re-tooled in some areas (I guess to make it copyright free?) The gore effects here are really some of the best to ever grace a horror film, trust me if it's gore you want, than it's gore you're going to get! as we see a badly mutilated, re-animated feline, broken teeth, chewed off fingers, crushed heads, killer intestines, lopped off heads, hacked off arms, corpses getting their scalps removed, surgical saws tearing through skulls, surgical drills through the body, popped eyeballs & in what has to be one of the most outrageous, offensive & completely unforgettable scenes in the annals of horror movie history, heroine Barbara Crampton is tied to a gurney, where she is molested by a severed, bloody, diabolical talking head of Dr. Hill! Love it or hate it, RE-ANIMATOR is a film that I promise you, you'll never forget!All in all, RE-ANIMATOR is an absolute must see for any & all horror fans! it's a real treat for fans wanting one of the best most hardcore horror/comedy/splatter flick ever made!

Despite being released over 18 years ago, the movie still holds remarkably well. Basically what we have here is a modern Frankenstein story. Herbert West (Jeffrey Combs) discovers a unique potion that brings the dead back to life, but with some catastrophic side effects. So, for the rest of the movie he's on a quest for the right dose, while leaving a trail of mayhem behind. This is a very adult film (graphically gory and violent, nude scenes, etc.) but also manages to sport a sick and twisted sense of humor that does not lessen its gore aspect. It's a real shame that not too many of today's horror films have this wit and audacity. The effects hold up real well and actually look more realistic than all those CG effects we see in abundance in modern horror pictures.  There are a couple of DVD versions out there and either one will do. If you truly like your horror over the top and with a dash of sick black humor, don't miss Re-Animator!

The Swiss police help Dr. Gruber to his feet and all of a sudden his eyeballs explode!  Awesome!Then we cut to hospital in Arkham, Massachusetts where Herbert West has joined the pathology staff and is immediately resented by the chief pathologist, Dr. Hill (David Gale) while his assistant, Daniel Cain (Bruce Abbott) doesn't know what to make of him.  But with a quick wad of cash, West moves into a room in Cain's house in order to split the rent.  Then West takes over the basement for his experiments using the same green florescent fluid he used in Switzerland to 're-animate' the dead.Gore scenes includeBringing Cain's dead cat back to life.  A so-so scene.Re-animating a dead body of a muscleman in the hospital morgue freezer that then starts to bleed from the mouth and attacks them while Dean Halsey (Robert Sampson) is standing outside the door.  The body slams open the door crushing Dean Halsey in the process.  The 'dead' corpse throws Halsey against the wall, biting off a couple of his fingers.  West then comes up from behind and kills it using a surgical saw through it's back and out it's chest.  Cool scene!They then re-animate Dean Halsey's dead body back to life just in time for his daughter Megan (Barbara Crampton) to walk in and get the sh*t scared out of her.  Halsey winds up in a padded cell with a straight jacket on looking like something out of a George Romero flick.  Even after Dr. Hill lobotomizes Halsey, all it does is make him worse.  It's hilarious.After Dr. Hill snoops down in West's basement, West kills him and decapitates Hill's head from it's body with a shovel because Hill is trying to blackmail him.  He re-animates both Hill's head and his body and it's funny watching the body carry Hill's head in it's arms as it then sews the head back on.  Great scene!The ending scene where all the corpses in the morgue come back to life is a hoot!!  Dean Halsey turns on Dr. Hill's head and squeezes it to a pulp.  Then he throws it out in the hallway to the astonishment of the black security guard that's standing out there.  I couldn't help but laugh at that one.  The meat from the head starts dripping from the walls onto the hallway floor while the security guard runs down the hall in terror.  (laughing)Then when West injects Hill's now-again headless body with a double-dose of serum, it's chest cavity starts to rip apart sending Hill's intestines flying out of it's body trying to strangle Dr. West.  Outrageous!!  Utterly outrageous!!While this is all going on, another corpse is strangling Megan in the hallway and Cain comes up from behind and chops off it's arm with an axe.  He then rushes Megan upstairs and fails to revitalize her in the emergency room.  But then Cain thinks about that green fluid again and...well...  There's a lot more that I can say but you'll just have to see it for yourself.The widescreen Image DVD uses the un-cut shorter version (which is the best!) along with the deleted scenes from the R-rated version that made it into most videos back in the 80s.  It's just a bunch of dialog talk that was used in order to pad out the movie and make up for the gore stuff that was cut out of the shorter version.

Look no further; you have found Re-Animator. Directed by Stuart Gordon and drawn from an H.P. Lovecraft story, Re-Animator tells the story of two college kids who find their lives turned upside down when they discover a special serum that can rejuvenate dead tissue, effectively bringing the dead back to life. Unfortunately the re-animation process has its downfalls as its subjects come back as manic and maniacal undead meat-bags. The pair also finds themselves at odds with an authority figure that takes a liking to a lady-friend and threatens to squash their discovery. Shenanigans ensue in an all-out frenzied finale that will leave you wondering what you just saw.The anchor of the film, Jeffrey Combs, plays college student by day/mad scientist by night Herbert West with such a creepy and convincing delivery that you forget he's playing a character. By his side are his hapless roommate played by Bruce Abbot and the chronically undressed Barbara Crampton as the plot-device that comes between the pair and their foe, the unrelentingly bitter professor played with exquisite expertise and a seemingly endless amount of glee by David Gale. Pile on a heavy dosage of severed heads, rotting corpses and oozing red stuff, and you have a meal that won't disappoint. All of this is of course delivered with an underlying sense of humor that is typical of '80s gross-out flicks like Evil Dead II and Return of the Living Dead, making Re-Animator a bizarre yet intoxicating cocktail that never fails to entertain time and time again.

Finally, though I got a reasonable price and quite frankly it would have been worth it at the more expensive price as well. As good as advertised this horror comedy really delivers the goods. Though I am apt to say it is more horror than comedy as there are chuckles to be sure, but it contains more horror elements than say Return of the Living Dead or Dead Alive among others. The gore is good in this one, granted not all the effects are top notch (like say the cat), but it is an older movie and probably does a better job then than would be done now. Of course what makes this movie a bit better than your average horror is the acting. Jeffery Combs is great as Herbert West, as the usually over the top actor is once again doing what he does best, playing an over the top character. The supporters are good as well and Barbara Compton is simply gorgeous. The story, there is an incident in a foreign country involving a very famous doctor. One of his prize students is now enrolling in a school in Arkham Massachusetts I believe. He becomes roomies with a fellow student there and he quickly shows odd behavior. There is a doctor at the school who is seemingly less bizarre than West, who West can not stand and who is more creepily bizarre than West ever could be. Well let's just say experiments galore and the dead are reanimated and can the young medical student who took West in keep his very understanding girlfriend?

Judging this movie, I have to stop and remember that this had a low budget, so the script had to be tinked with. I first read the short story by H. P. Lovecraft, and then viewed it on DVD. Lovecraft invented some fascinating parts in his version, like West and the nameless narrator's house being burnt down, a buried boxer appearing at their backdoor gnawing on a child's forearm and West firing 6 shots into its face, Dr. Halsey being reanimated and going on a killing spree taking down 17 people, West and the narrator entering World War 1 and reanimating a decapitated major, and finally West being ripped to pieces by a horde of zombies in his basement while the narrator watches.SPOILERS However, this version stuck half-way true to it Dr. Halsey being the one who gets ripped to pieces, Dr. Hill being decapitated and reanimated, and a horde of zombies coming after West. With such low budget, how could Stuart Gordon and Brian Yuzna film a flaming house, World War 1 footage, etc.I don't know if this was intended to be a horror film, it probably was, but it passed off more as a gruesome comedy. When reading the summary, it sounds like a Frankenstein rip-off, but it actually isn't. Frankenstein was resurrected with multiple body parts, West just resurrects dead bodies but has disastrous results if the bodies aren't fresh enough, meaning the brain cells haven't depleted too much. For some reason, every Lovecraft movie has to incorporate some new heroine character, like Megan Halsey in this case, even though the story doesn't require one, but for all horny guys out there, this movie does have some eye-catching breast shots. If you viewers have a sense of humor, then you will get at least some kick out of watching this. Jeffrey Combs fits the role as Herbert West 99%, that 1% being his hair it's black, but Lovecraft wrote him as being blond; other than that, he did a spectacular job, no wonder he went on to make 2 sequels. The unsung hero here is Bruce Abbot, the nameless narrator, who just wants to marry the dean's daughter, whom he sincerely loves, and become a doctor, but West destroys those dreams, and Halsey, and Megan. Dr. Hill might be comparative to Vincent Price; it appears noticeable that his severed head is still attached to his body underneath the scrubs of the guy holding him.It's not an all-star winner, since the low budget might have hindered a finer quality feature, but it won the Cannes Film Festival for best picture of the year, so Stuart Gordon did pretty good. The score might get irritating after a while, but there are a couple scenes where it ties in perfectly to the mood. All good actors, Barbara playing Megan probably wasn't the best fit actress, but she deserves no bad mouthing, she got nude shamelessly and still stayed in character (hats off). I don't think Stuart Gordon is a great director, but he did a good job here. You probably won't keep it if you buy it on DVD, but if it's ever on TV, it's worth looking at...if your parents aren't around that is.

I was 17 when I first saw this low budget gore-fest and remember thinking it was the dog's dangly bits at the time. Would it impress me as much the second time around? Well, the answer is 'very nearly'. The film is an excellent example of 'grand guignol' splatter and there is plenty to admire in it's sheer verve and gloriously twisted approach, but it isn't quite the flawless masterpiece that I had thought it was.In director Stuart Gordon's adaptation of H. P. Lovecraft's 'Herbert West Re-animator', Jeffrey Combs plays eccentric genius Dr. Herbert West, who is able to bring the dead back to life by injecting them with his incredible discovery, a luminous green 're-agent'. Unfortunately, results thus far have been less than successful, with subjects flying into an uncontrollable rage on reanimation. West suspects that a combination of correct dosage and freshness of subject is the key to success.After the suspicious death of his professor in Switzerland, West relocates to the Miskatonic Medical School where he enlists the help of fellow student Dan Cain to help continue his research. Dan stupidly reveals the nature of his experiments to the dean of the school (who also happens to be the father of Dan's tasty girlfriend Meg), resulting in his student loan being rescinded and West's expulsion from the school. In a last ditch effort to perfect the reanimation procedure, the two men sneak into the school's morgue for one last attempt at bringing the dead to life. Things don't go as planned and the dean is accidentally killed when he interrupts proceedings; West promptly reanimates the dean, but he comes back as a drooling mess.When the university's top professor, Carl Hill (who secretly lusts after Meg), sees the dean, he makes it his mission to discover what has really happened. He discovers that the dean is technically dead and, realising that West is on the brink of a major medical breakthrough, he tries to claim the discovery for himself. But West isn't about to give up his 're-agent' without a fight&#133;Where 'Re-animator' succeeds is in its gleeful no-holds barred approach. The story is extremely preposterous and Gordon and his cast do not attempt to lend proceedings any gravity, opting instead for an over-the-top, anything-goes, tongue-in-cheek style. From the opening pre-credits scene, in which a characters eyes bulge and burst from his skull, viewers know that this is going to be all about the gore. And what a lot of gore we get!! The FX team deliver a huge range of splattery effects which certainly impress, given the limited budget of the movie. Most are extremely effective, so I am able to forgive the odd less successful moment. Highlights include a brain removal, a juicy finger biting, a bone saw through the torso, a decapitation with a spade, a crushed head thrown at a wall, an exploding stomach with writhing intestines, and the infamous scene in which a stark naked Meg receives a bit of (severed) head!So what, in my opinion, stops 'Re-animator' from being perfect? The answer is in the editing.The 'original cut' of the film ran for over two hours. It was severely edited to improve the pacing. The 'unrated' theatrical version kept all of its gore but missed moments which I felt were vital to help clarify certain plot points; the result is a 'choppy' narrative which leaves unanswered questions. The 'R' version had much of the gore removed and some of the trimmed scenes reinstated. Neither version is perfect.Funnily enough, the Psychoesque score, which seems to be a problem for many viewers, never bothered me. Yes, it was a blatant case of plagiarism (very closely resembling Bernard Hermann's classic theme), but it worked well.I highly recommend 'Re-animator' to all fans of gory horror, but I do suggest that they watch the 'unrated' version and then the deleted scenes afterwards to fully appreciate what might have been.

He doesn't get off on the right foot either, at his new university hospital, immediately making enemies with one of the lecturers, brazenly criticizing him, and gathering a response, by the snap of a pencil. He shacks up new roomie, Bruce Abbott (Bad Dreams) and his hottie, scream queen/quality actress Crampton, who back in the eighties was unfortunately used in small roles, mostly.

It was his first experience in film and unfortunately the most successful (as he likes to say - his personal Citizen Kane), not counting all the same good and just as positively greeted by a film critic «From Beyond».Re-Animator - this is above all a very interesting story about obsessed with his experiments on corpses scientist. Largely due to his skills gained in working on the plays in the theater, Gordon was able to convey the comic and drama of this story, not without the help of screenwriter Dennis Paoli, who rewrote the original script by William Norris, a desire to give him a big Gothic elements. After all, in fact, a scientist Herbert West is not entirely worried about the fate of people around him. Its nothing exciting. No morals and no remorse. For example, in one scene in the film one character dies right in front of West and his friend Dan, but our mad scientist did not saddened. Not hesitating for a second he was already considering a new body as fresh item for your experiment! «Show must go on» I sang Freddie Mercury / group Queen. No matter who suffers from the next of his experiment - the main thing to continue.And with all this, the audience still gets to the side and West on human experiences is to him, maybe even more than his friend Dan in his personal tragedy. This is caused not only a talented actor playing fulfill this role - Jeffrey Combs - but his main opponent in the film Dr. Hill performed by actor David Gale (facial features which, as noted by many of the crew, in many respects similar to the features Boris Karloff known for the role of Frankenstein.) Gale's character is much more callous and cold-blooded person than the hero of Jeffrey Combs, and eventually he wants to not only steal the secret of serums developed West, but has dirty thoughts on Dean Halsey's daughter.And very true solution was to beat many of the film with dark humor. This may not be noticed at the first viewing, but the characters, most often the hero, sometimes utter such ridiculous and implausible sentences, like the one that said Dan West on the dead cat, it's hard not to laugh.And yet, despite the fact that what is happening on the screen like crazy (but fun), a farce with the revived corpses and copious bloodletting, there is a really amazing actor sketches.

Herbert West is back! And this time he's not as dead as he was at the end of the first Re-Animator (which was a lot of dead). Yay! I don't even care that the film has no explanation as to his or Dan's survival, I'm just glad to see them again and yes, they are still perverting the course of nature with bright green stuff, those crazy goofs.The film begins bizarrely by telling us that rather than die as it appeared in the original, our 'heroes' instead volunteered to be doctors in some random South American revolution. Fair enough, it's what I would have done. Now we know that volunteering for such revolutions looks a lot like dieing. That's a nice thing to tell a child whose rabbit's just died; fluffy volunteered for the Peruvian guerrillas. Anyway, they are continuing their EVYIL EXPERYMENTS on the wounded until a pretty woman runs in to the tent with a gun and tells them that they are coming. Soon, they arrive&#133; all three of them. These prophesized hairy men open fire and things get exciting as West and Dan have to make a run for it. Do they get away? A short scene change later and we find that yes&#133;yes they did get away. Not only did they get away, but they seem to have gotten jobs in the very same hospital that they caused a massacre of undead proportions in the last time. Not so good staff vetting procedures at this hospital I feel.Soon a policeman sniffs around. I hate him. You see, on the DVD I have the sound quality's not that good. This big fat policeman talks so quietly I had to constantly adjust the volume to hear what he was saying, not that it really mattered&#133;plot is no-ones priority here. One of the reasons I enjoy the Re-animator films so much has solely to do with Jeffery Combs' amazing turn as Herbert West. That and the comedy gore. Let me put it this way; at one point Dr. Hill (the disembodied head from the first film) returns and, wait to you hear how awesome this is&#133;he gets bat wings installed into the sides of his head so that he can fly. Yes. Fly. I think I clapped.The ending of this film makes everything worthwhile. Cheeky Herbert has been combining parts and re-animating them; a foot with a hand, two half people stuck together and all manner of other freaky funny stuff appears, all while Hill's flying head flaps around cackling. Also earlier in the film there was a cool spider-like thing he made using some fingers and an eyeball, which was hideously underused. It should have got a spin off.It should be known that bat-head Hill looks like one time presidential candidate horse face. I mean John Kerry.Did I mention the flying head?

Soon, Dean Alan Halsey, (Robert Sampson) assigns young Dr. Herbert West, (Jeffrey Combs) to his assistant role, which resident Dr. Carl Hill, (David Gale) is none to pleased with, especially when he gets shown up at every turn. When his daughter Megan, (Barbara Crampton) begins to wonder what he's doing at the university, he finally reveals that he has a serum that can revive the dead, which they all immediately want to take from him for their own personal use. Now forced to deal with the various reanimated corpses running around the campus, he tries to keep them under control while figuring out a way to stop them.The Good News This here is one of the best horror films in the genre. The thing that this one does so well that very few others get so well is the mixing of the gross-out gore with the funny and humorous moments. The gore in here is about as good as possible for the time, and sometimes it gets really messy. The kills in here do get some gore, as there's a shovel used to sever the head from the neck, fingers being bitten off, a multitude of limbs taken off with just about everything possible, including axes, bare hands, knives and much more, as well seeing a victim strangled with a strand of ambulatory intestines. There's a main focus on blood-splatter here, with it flying everywhere, onto walls, others and any nearby furniture, leaving a mess just about everywhere. Factor in with that all the make-up work on the reanimated, which is quite a standout. The blood stains on the skin, mangled features and postmortem scars on just about everything allow them to look somewhat original and have some sense of menace to them. As usual, they're kept to mainly being a threat due to the large numbers of them that attack, since they can be fought off reasonably well if only an individual or two but the victims succumb when swarmed by several, exactly the kind of threat they should pose, as they were dead for a while after all. The film also manages to incorporate humor into it with relative ease, making this one a real joy to sit through. From the snappy come-back lines to the insults to the one-liners thrown about with reckless abandon, this one manages to have a pretty funny feel to it that will include a couple lines here and there for some to find funny. There's also a large amount of physical gags that are included to also get some sort of laugh out of them. The sight of the headless zombie using a diagram's head to wander around unsuspected, the flying head gags and the multitude of body-parts gags here get a chuckle, which is what was aimed at. There's even some scares in here from the many instances where the reanimated bodies pop up from under covers unexpectedly, and they get a small jolt. The film gets a little sleazy with the infamous scene where a completely nude woman is forced to engage in oral sex with the severed head, being held by the reanimated body, which itself provides numerous punch-lines and comes off as the single most inventive scene in a film filled with it. The idea about the serum holding off natural reactions is ingenious, and the after-effects that come from them are solid gold. The finale, though, is it's most fun segment, which is where the majority of the gore comes from, the action is wall-to-wall, it's creepy and has plenty to endear itself to others. These here make it rather fun and enjoyable.The Bad News There isn't a whole lot here, and they aren't that big either. The main issue here is the effects caused by the serum. It's never told how it works, what happened that caused it's creation or anything about how it works. The only time anything close to it is the fact that it's said to reanimate the dead brain cells, causing the dead to live again, but how and why it works is an utter blank. For something as important to the film as that, a little more about it would've been nice. The film's only other problems here relate to tolerance matters. The amount of gore in here might be a tad excessive, the humor might not be funny to some, and the amount of sleaze present could be a turn-off. Otherwise, this here is just fine.The Final Verdict With a lot to like about it and only a few minor flaws, this one is a really entertaining and enjoyable feature. Really recommended to the gore-hounds or the fans of the cheesy 80s classics, while just about most horror fanatics should take a look as there isn't a whole lot who won't like this.Rated UN/R Graphic Violence, Full Nudity, Language, a sex scene and animal violence "}{"Title":"It's alright","Date":"11 January 2007","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" I was really hyped up about watching this, but it let me down somewhat.The acting is really good, especially Jeffery Combs, who steals the movie as Dr Herbert West.

I have difficulty creating that distance. When viewers say that this film is funny, my first reaction is Who laughed? But I realize that those that find humor in it,have the capacity, which I lack, to see the film purely as a creation, as something objective, an art work to be analyzed. I become personally involved in what's happening in a film, identify with the characters, live with them, empathize with them, search for reason for their behaviors. I've lost the capacities I once had to abstract myself as an aficionado of horror flicks must do. If I could have I would have enjoyed the film more . The film gives new meaning to the word excess. Throughout its guiding principle is if anything more horrible can happen, it will. It is macabre, gruesome; the plot is out of control; the acting, except for the two young lover, stylized, one dimensional; the cast is composed of corpses, has-been corpses and corpses to be. This is all intentional, and for many this is great fun. I intend to watch the sequel to perhaps recover my lost innocence.

Each time I truck out to see some new 'interpretation' of one of Lovecraft's stories, I am almost always appauled.  Re-animator was not such an event, and while I doubt that that the taciturn Mr. Lovecraft would have approved of the film, I think it was pretty cool.One of the main problems is that this film was apparently edited for release on videotape and much of the gore and blood from the original was actually REMOVED (I think that this may be one of the only examples of this kind of self-censorship).  If you were not one of us lucky few to have seen it originally, then it may not appear to be as funny or as gross as you have been lead to believe.  One should also keep in mind (although I am not a stickler for accuracy in film adaptations) that the humor in this film is truly inspired by Lovecraft himself.  Herbert West-Re-animator was written as a serial for a COMEDY magazine.  The story is very dry and sardonic (sometimes to the point where the humor is unrecognizable), but it is still very funny and meant to be taken tongue-in-cheek.  However, this is still a remarkably enjoyable movie with a particularly inspired performance by Combs.  Overall, I would advise anyone with a modicum of interest in truly entertaining horror films to check this one out.  If you can find it.

RE-ANIMATOR is certainly a film like nothing anyone had seen up to the point of its original release. Yes, there had been dozens of mad scientist movies but this one here manages to mix gore, sex, violence and comedy unlike any other film before and director Stuart Gordon deserves a lot of credit for taking all of those elements and making them work so well together. What I enjoyed most about the picture is the fact that you never quite know where it's going to go next. The film takes all sorts of wild turns as the doctor's experiments just grow more outlandish and dangerous and especially once another doctor gets put into the mix. This other doctor also has one of the most outstanding scenes in the film but I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it. However, once you've seen the film then you'll know what I'm talking about. Combs is perfect in his role as the crazed scientist and I really enjoyed how serious and how dark he played the character. Abbott is a lot more fun in his over-the-top style but the two actors work perfectly well together. Both David Gale and Robert Sampson are fun in their parts and Barbara Crampton is wonderfully charming as the girlfriend. RE-ANIMATOR is about as good as a film like this is going to get as all the elements work well and director Gordon perfectly pulls it together.

If the reader cannot tell or appreciate the difference between blood splattering slasher fiction and mind-shattering horror fiction, Lovecraft might be perceived as just another psychotic writer putting his nightmares to paper. I don't like Reanimator the movie simply because it does not convey the feeling of the written story; it does not stimulate that portion of the mind that craves a good scare. The movie has some interesting points, but these somewhat high points are overshadowed as the film turns to comedy and nudity for continuity.

As a teenager, I think young men (and women, for that matter) often come across certain films which awaken lust for the first time. Crampton and Linnea Quigley (by way of The Return of the Living Dead) were two of the first lust desires I remember as a teenager. They were visions in my fantasies, and it was horror films that led to this sexual awakening in me. But back to Re-Animator, this film is a spin on the mad scientist sub-genre horror that goes way back to Frankenstein, as Jeffrey Combs' Dr. Herbert West is just an extension of Dr. Frankenstein, with a desire to give the dead life and, in the process, be the one responsible for a great discovery. But doing this, playing God, if you will, always ends badly for any scientist who attempts to practice science that involves reanimating the dead. This film shows that West's green liquid, a reagent he calls it, has really violent side effects&#x97;those dead injected with the reagent always return as animal savages, primitive in behavior going after people that are in their trajectory. Of course, the fly in the ointment besides the negative reactions from guinea pigs injected, is brain surgeon, Professor Dr. Carl Hill (David Gale), actually a psychopath who harbours a deeply disturbing obsessive desire for Miskitonic University's Dean Alan Halsey's college-aged daughter, Megan (Barbara Crampton) who stole ideas from a mentor of West's (a German scientist we see suffering a grotesque reaction to West's reagent in Switzerland). Hill likes to steal from others so that he can reap the accolades and rewards to further enhance his own reputation and career (although he does invent a truly evil form of laser lobotomy that provides him with the ability to control humans experimented on) and plans to do the same thing with West's reanimation reagent. We follow the destruction of the potential of Bruce Abbot's promising, bright medical student, Daniel Cain, who has the unfortunate fate of renting his basement to West, entering a partnership with the scientist that returns disastrous consequences to his life and student career. You can't help but scream at Cain to cut ties with West, because only bad can come from aligning himself with someone who only cares about success of his experiment&#x97;no matter who else gets hurt and the damage caused to innocents caught in the middle of the dangerous effects of the reagent.The make-up effects have always been amazing to me. There's a no boundaries approach that I admire about the gore such as the decapitated head stuck on a paper weight in a bed pan (a shovel used to separate the head from the body!), the bone saw used to penetrate the chest of a massive muscular corpse that kills Dean Halsey, the headless walking torso carrying its disembodied head around, the eerie corpses of a burn victim and one with a shot gun blast to the face that look so incredibly accurate that run amok, and the manic dead cat that is torn practically in half rising from a table after the reagent awakens itThe absurdity of these gore sequences play in the film's favor because of the fantasy element of the mad science involved in the screenplay&#x97;the ability for the corpses and reanimated body parts to move about and raise havoc is due to West's amazing experimental breakthrough, but the results offer nothing but tragedy. Despite the film's sense of dark body part and corpse humor, there's also a dramatic arc I think adds a unique heart to the movie and that is the relationship of Meg and Dan, how it is ripped apart by Herbert West, with a desperate, misguided decision made out of heartbreak and loss to use the reagent we know will not end well.The most notorious scene involves a naked Megan, stripped by her lobotomized father, at the request of demented Hill (whose head is guiding his separated body), bound to a gurney and almost sexually molested&#x97;response to this scene could be met with either horror or arousal. Because I'm absolutely attracted to Crampton, I had a mixed reaction&#x85;seeing her so exposed and violated already before the head can even make contact to her vagina, I was met with arousal to her desirable body, yet felt disturbed by her inability to escape from this bleak predicament. West, of all people, comes to her rescue, not allowing the poor character to be dealt any more violation. Credit to Crampton for enduring this scene because she is completely nude with Hill's head between her legs.

Some films are just so bad that they're good, so stupid they're brilliant; this is a perfect example of just that kind of magnanimous suckiness that makes you love a movie even though you know it's a piece of crap. 'The Re-animator' is to horror films what Dr. Who is to TV- lovably campy dreck.This quality is apparent even from reading the plot synopsis on the back of the video cover Now Herbert West has a problem on his hands. Well, um, yeah! Most people's problems go something like, Uh-oh, I 've overdrawn my bank account, or Oh, great, a huge zit just before my big date! But Help, my legion of zombies are out of control, and they're turning against me!- HUGE freakin' problem, if you ask me.This film is pure camp, and shamelessly overdone. The creepy guy (Jeffrey Combs as Herbert West) is just too creepy for his own good- the ultimate geek-weirdo stereotype rolled into one, like Steve Urkul meets Dr. Frankenstein. It renders him amusing as opposed to scary, and yet still completely unlikeable.It's completely inexplicable why his nice, straight-arrow roommate gets sucked into his deviant experiments in resurrecting the dead (as the results yield no life, just violently reactive meatpuppets) and continues to stick by him even after every single experiment goes horribly, horribly wrong.West, for his part, is somewhere between stubborn and just plain crazy- he brushes off the atrocities that follow his experiments, convinced that if he can just get the right specimen as quickly following the exact point of death as possible, he will unlock the secret to conquering mortality. He finally- almost- gets it right when he murders his professional rival and brings him directly back to life, sans head, but death and disfigurement has unfortunately had an aversive effect on this guy's character; and it's always bad when a person who hates you now knows all your secrets and quite literally has nothing to lose. The other zombies are just wild-eyed monsters who appear confused, enraged, and in excruciating agony all the time, but don't possess much of a rational thought process, making them the ultimate candidates for evil minions. Even better, West's rival has discovered that even individual body parts can be animated can be put to use all on their own. Don't expect anything to make very much sense after this point; but don't expect it to be very frightening either. A lower intestine bursting through an abdominal cavity and unraveling itself like Inspector Gadget's arm so it can grab ahold and wrap itself around you like a boa constrictor is pretty gross, but just too ridiculous to give you genuine willies.If you, like me, need things to be at least somewhat logical, then you probably won't get into this, but who's a big enough snob to make fun of you for loving it? Lovecraft fans beware,though this adaptation really has nothing to do with the actual story other than the basic premise. "}{"Title":"Not for the squeamish....and rather silly.  But if you can just turn off your brain and enjoy, then you'll probably enjoy it.","Date":"11 December 2013","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" If Re-Animator was very realistic, it would be unwatchable. After all, there are gallons and gallons and gallons of blood and enough internal organs to satisfy Andrew Zimern's cravings for the next 200 years! But the effects are mostly pretty cheesy and the story never takes itself seriously--two things that make the film worth seeing. However, even with cheesy gore, there is a lot of gore....A LOT. So, it's obviously not a film for many viewers. I would not show this to young viewers, my mother or anyone I am trying to impress with my intellect! The film is about a goofy med student who thinks he's smarter than all his professors (he's probably right, actually). So, on his own he works on his own project--to create a serum for the reanimation of the dead. At first he tries it out on animals, but like all true mad scientists, he cannot stop there. Unfortunately, the serum has a minor side effect--it seems to make many of the recipients crazed killing machines or blithering idiots. Plus, it reanimates TISSUE--meaning that even parts can become moving, living and killing machines.So is it worth seeing? Well, if you are an H.P. Lovecraft fan and you want to see HIS version of the Re-animator short stories, you'll be disappointed. Some of the film is reasonably close to Lovecraft--most is not. Also, if you are looking for a film reminiscent of something from the Criterion Collection of a Merchant-Ivory film, you should avoid the movie at all costs. If, however, you have a high tolerance for gore, LOTS of explicit nudity and violence and have a sick, dark sense of humor, then by all means this film is for you! Well made despite being cheesy, sick and twisted. You KNOW this is a bloodbath of a film when it makes the Living Dead films seem like Disney pics!!

He has created a serum which can bring the dead back to life. Only there's a problem - the longer the subject has been dead, the more violent and murderous their resurrection will be.Teaming up with a reluctant fellow student they experiment on twice dead cats and then onto real people. But the sleazy Doctor Hill finds out and muscles in on the action only to be slaughtered by West, who decapitates him with a spade.Out of pure curiosity, West brings the head and body back to life as two separate entities. And Hill continues to screw with West's work, despite having to carry around his own head most of the time.Despite being very well made for the budget it was made on, Re-Animator doesn't have much going for it outside of energetic performances and a real enthusiasm for horror too rarely seen these days. There is no plot and events in the film only seem to happen to shock us or lead into yet another gore scene.And there lies another problem - the filmmakers are keen to give us loads of gore and entrails and while they may be gross the first time round, by the second viewing you'll be disappointed at how tame it really is. No horror is implied or suggested. The only horror there is is that which is shown on screen. The indignity of not being able to rest in peace is never once considered and the murderous corpses are not all that scary.Richard Band's score is nothing more than just alright too. It has an urgent sound to it but doesn't do much for the film and is completely free of melody or theme. In fact I'd argue that it's just the same cue played over and over. The lighting is flat and bland, with barely an ounce of atmosphere and the porn movie sets don't help much.Gordon and Yuzna were obviously keen to make Re-Animator as best as they can and you can tell that they had a blast making it, but it's just not even up to standards the genre set by films like Evil Dead. And, speaking of Evil Dead, the Necronomicon (according to H.P. Lovecraft) is located in the library of Miskatonic University. Why didn't Doctor West just use that to bring the dead back to life?West himself would go onto star in two sequels and feature as the primary antagonist in the Splatterhouse video games. He's a great character and the film soars whenever he is on screen. I just wish it was more ambitious.

The movie does at times shock with its images but really, the movie remains more fun than anything else really. The humor in the movie is very dark and it has some absolutely priceless and original moments in it, that are so odd and surreal that you MUST laugh. It helps to make Re-Animator a very enjoyable and entertaining movie to watch.The story of the movie is absolutely great. It's simple but all very well executed. It really is the fact that the movie obviously doesn't take itself serious that makes the over-the-top, unrealistic story work so well. Perhaps not everything in the movie works out as solid as it could had been, because of that very same reason but it in no way makes Re-Animator less enjoyable to watch.The main characters of the movie aren't really charismatic enough, with the exception of David Gale who plays the main bad guy of the movie. The characters don't make a solid enough impression and make the movie less solid as it could had been. Not really only the actors fault but also director Stuart Gordon who perhaps lied the emphasis of the movie a bit too much on the gore and dark-comical elements of the movie at times.There are absolutely some great and certainly original sequences in the movie, which all helps to make this movie a very memorable one. When a head and I mean just a head, is raping a young woman you know you're watching an original, horror cult-movie.

"},{"Title":"Re-Animator (1985)","Date":"4 May 2009","Score":"2 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" Horror and comedy are very hard to put together. A lot of revulsion can come from comedic ideas and many horrific concepts can be amusing. But an idea that's both scary and funny at the same time is incredibly rare. Some fans hate every film that combines the two and need their horror completely pure. Me- I can appreciate a good mix or horror with anything else, if it is indeed good. When I look at the horror films I enjoy most, a large percentage are horror-comedy hybrids. But are they really funny? What is most essential for a horror-comedy is energy. It doesn't matter if the jokes fail, it's the concept that needs to work. Or the filmmaker needs the pace running smoothly, to keep the viewer entertained. Within reason, I think the undisputed master of the horror-comedy is Peter Jackson. He knows better than any filmmaker how to make the most disgusting things ever put on screen amusing. Even pushing them as far as they can go, until the film's excesses become pure art.Stuart Gordon is no Peter Jackson. His real inspiration is obviously H.P. Lovecraft, the writer Gordon gets most of his movie ideas from. But that said, how funny were the man's stories intended to be? I hear many Lovecraft fans are appalled at what Gordon has done with his work. I could care less. I've always said- a book's a book, a movie's a movie. And that applies to short stories too. But without him, Gordon would have no career. So right away you have to accept that this is an adaptation. Criticize the film for what it is and I won't criticize the material it was derived from. On one hand, you have what I'm sure are graphic stories from Lovecraft that were probably a lot more serious than this film is. On the other, you have a filmmaker trying to in some ways push the boundaries. With that in mind, I think I would have enjoyed the film being so graphic if the purpose were to shock and horrify. Not to make people laugh a little and cringe safely.Re-Animator is an excessive film where the excess is used to get a reaction out of people, not to further the story. But always with a kind of childish gag on the end of it to make it easy to swallow for mass audiences. The film has no dark ambiance, no creepy atmosphere. Just a few set-ups where a zombie will go after someone and a lot of gore, almost always generated from an already dead cadaver. Which is where I point out- that's how the film uses it's gross out quotient. Since it takes place mostly in a medical hospital with a very busy morgue, there are a ton of corpses lying around. Thereby supplying the film with lots of bodies to spew gore from. My one problem with that is that the film shows you people taking those corpses apart. You can see that stuff on The Learning Channel, and just because you can see it doesn't mean most people consider it entertainment. And it may be disgusting, but it sure as hell isn't scary. Not that a non-scary horror film bothers me, as I hope I've proved.Other reviewers have already brought up the score by Richard Band which rips off the theme from Psycho. I don't know what this film has to do with Hitchcock and I don't think I want to know either. I have always been very much against filmmakers outright ripping off other movies. But nothing is worse than a film copying a scene shot for shot or a piece of music note for note. Band copies Bernard Herrmann note for note. Only, adding an 80's synthesized beat to it. Like a very low-key techno song. Not only is it unnecessary to copy another composer's piece, but Herrmann's original was just so much better. I will give Band one credit. The piece that plays during the sequence where Meg walks down the hall into Herbert West's room is good.The story seems a clever enough idea. And I would have forgiven any number of scenes that moved too slowly- I think slowness is crucial to horror (if the right music and atmospheric elements are in place). But the characters are so grating and the dialogue is so melodramatic, it's like watching a very bland soap opera. Probably the best thing about the movie is how down-trodden Dan Cain is. It doesn't make him interesting, but considering how seldom men in horror play vulnerable, it is admittedly fun to watch him getting screwed all the time. Especially since the actor Bruce Abbott is so beautiful. With his always visible sensitivity and high emotional scenes, it's as though his relationship with Meg works because they're both nurturing. A first in horror? Though most of the time, I wish he would just suck it up so we could move on. Meg, on the other hand, is extremely irritating. With her always high-pitched voice and constant whining, she is the definitive Female Victim. But I just wanted her to shut up. A first for me!David Gale as the evil Dr. Hill certainly walks away with the movie's Best Actor Award and is the only thing creepy here. Jeffrey Combs as Herbert is just annoying. But, his interplay with Gale actually makes his character slightly interesting. Two mad scientists in one movie? That's gold. And I would say it's great watching Gale lose his head. Anything to shake the movie up, right? But the languorous, flat pacing just continues. Things never ascend to the next level. The score keeps dropping pennies in a bucket. And though there's one truly cool montage of terrifyingly ghastly zombie face closeups, we also have to see them naked. You ever seen a naked zombie? It's just plain gross. Not entertaining. Gross!

Those are the only 2 movies I've seen by them and so far, they are 2 for 2.Scientist Herbert West (Jeffrey Combs) has discovered a re-animating agent that when injected into a dead person or animal, they come back to life. Zombies, basically. They have to be killed again because they go crazy and kill others.A lot of things do not quite make sense together, such as why they would try to bring back a loved one to cover up the fact that he was killed for one but I'll just chalk that up to panicked thinking on that characters part.The movie was a little dated but, for the most part, I enjoyed it. The main character was developed slowly and mysteriously so you would not know what to think of him. Finally his secret was revealed and he has been working on the re-animating agent the entire time.The two Stuart Gordon movies I've seen had pretty much the same feel, even though they were ten years apart. I can recommend this movie if you like the dated feel of these types of horror movies, kind of like Rocky Horror, but without the stupidity and the homosexual themes running rampant.

I could talk for hours and hours about this movie but it would all come down to the same thing...It's great ! Directed in the way it should be, based on a story by the almighty H.P Lovecraft. (this guy is much more the king of horror to me than Stephen King) Great actors as well. Jeffrey Combs is the most terrific horror actor alive. When he's working together with Stuart Gordon, a kick-ass movie is a fact.Also, the late David Gale is fantastic in this movie, his character Carl Hill is a very memorable horror-icon. The make-up effects and the gore are very well presented but you certainly don't have to be a gorehound to enjoy this film. If you're a fan of dark humor, original twists or just plain fun you'll have the time of your life as well. Jeffrey Combs is Dr. Herbert West. A brilliant, but very fanatic surgeon slash scientist. He discovered a liquid (flashy green -- cool!) that could bring the dead back to live. How? By activating the brain again. Dr. West is prepared to go beyond boundaries to continue his research. This involves experimenting on dead bodies but creating a few new corpses as well ! The freshness of the corpses seems to be very important. Of course, his discovery is very wanted by his competitors. Dr. Hill a professor at university wants to get his hands to it very much Re-animator is the modern Frankenstein. This is suggested even more in the, also very decent, sequel The bride of Re-Animator. This sequel has the same terrific cast and is directed by the producer of the original. Brian Yuzna, also a very respected name in the field of horror.In conclusion  Re-Animator is horror like it should be. Along with The Evil Dead and Nightmare on the Elm Street, this film belongs to the highlights of the 80's and it also easily finds its place in the best horror lists of all time. A must see for all horror-lovers, cult film-lovers and maybe even film-lovers in general. "},{"Title":"NOT H.P.

Recently, I managed to catch the same director's follow-up effort &#150; FROM BEYOND (1986) &#150; which, like the film under review, was inspired by the seminal writings of a master of the genre, H.P. Lovecraft; it also shares leads Jeffrey Combs and Barbara Crampton with RE-ANIMATOR &#150; which, all things considered, I'd say is slightly superior. The film itself spawned two sequels, namely BRIDE OF RE-ANIMATOR (1990) and BEYOND RE-ANIMATOR (2003).Anyway, as per the title, the narrative involves a medical student (the perfectly cast Combs) obsessed with conquering Death; after a spell as an assistant to an eminent scientist, he enrolls at a Medical College after the latter passes away under mysterious circumstances and immediately locks horns with a rival of his mentor (whose research, Combs believes, is outright plagiarism). He goes to live with a fellow student in love with the College Dean's daughter (Crampton, who looks good in and out of clothes) &#150; on whom even the middle-aged Professor has designs! Throughout the course of the movie, several attempts are made to restore dead bodies to life &#150; from the hero's black cat (which hates Combs' guts!) to the Dean (whom the Professor subsequently lobotomizes and makes his slave!), the Professor himself (he manages to revive even after having been beheaded!), and assorted other 'occupants' of the College morgue (all of this morbid activity goes on in spite of the presence of a laid-back black security guard, who remains oblivious and impassive practically to the end!).As can be expected from such a premise, the film is gruesome indeed (at least, though, we're spared here from seeing zombies feeding on the living); unsurprisingly, and as would again be the case with FROM BEYOND, any trace of a logical plot line goes out the window during the frantic final act to make way for a parade of revolting make-up effects! While it's nowhere near as stimulating as classic horror titles from preceding decades, the film is a good example of the style prevalent in its day (and a reasonably elevated effort in terms of quality). One major quibble I have with RE-ANIMATOR, though, concerns Richard Band's score &#150; which unashamedly rips off Bernard Herrmann's classic PSYCHO (1960) theme! "}]
