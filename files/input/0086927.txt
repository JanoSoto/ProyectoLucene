The weird thing is, I'm more used to a dramatic Tom Hanks, other than Big and A League of Their Own, I've never seen him in a raw comedy movie, so it was a little weird to think of Tom Hanks as this very funny male lead in a movie. But I decided to go ahead and give the movie a look, I have to tell you, I haven't laughed so hard and so out loud in a movie like this in a long time. Then I check out the rating on IMDb, 5.7?! Are you kidding me?! This movie is just so beyond funny, I know that it is clich√©'d eighties, but come on! I just couldn't believe that anyone else would not find this to be a funny film. If you're telling me you did not find Brad to be funny, you have got to get your funny bone checked because Bachelor Party is non stop laughs from beginning to end.Rick is about to get married to beautiful Debbie, his friends who live to party are throwing him the biggest bachelor party they can have. Debbie's rich and snobby family definitely don't want Rick to be apart of their lives, so Debbie's dad will do anything, including her ex-boyfriend, Cole, who wants her back, to split them up. But the bachelor party night has arrived, and things are going more crazy than the boys have expected.Bachelor Party is seriously funny, it's predictable and silly, especially the end, but it's all in good fun. This is perfect 80's humor, it's the humor I miss and I'm sure others do too, because it's raunchy but doesn't over do it and just has fun with the audience. This cast looked like they had an ultimate blast and Tom Hanks was just brilliant, his character could be a jerk, but such a great guy at the same time, so he's real and likable. This is just a funny movie that I would recommend, it's a lot of fun and the rating on IMDb is just too harsh. Come on, let's get this rating up.8/10 "},{"Title":"Classic!!","Date":"28 February 2006","Score":"29 out of 38 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" First of all, if you are thinking that this will be some wonderful, well thought out, well crafted artwork starring Tom Hanks, put the movie down and back away from the rack. Now flash back to 1984, when movies were inane and entertaining--solely for entertaining!!! As far as raunchy 80's humor goes, you won't find anything better that Bachelor Party. Yes, the humor is predictable. Yes, the sight gags are predictable. But this movie does it better than anyone else in it's genre (that would be raunchy comedy). Good girl falls for bad boy, plan to get married, but first the guys must be guys. Let's have a party with liquor and drugs and guns and hookers and cops! and they do.

Hanks delivers a satisfying and enjoyable performance as groom-to-be Rick Gassko, and his supporting cast couldn't have been better selected.  Many of the film's co-stars had worked with Hanks in the past, most notably on TV's Bosom Buddies.  The chemistry is apparent here, as the actors are all very comfortable in their roles, as the dialogue is executed with a smooth, yet expedient wit.  The jokes all work in this film - outlandish as some of them may be.  There is never a dull moment in Bachelor Party, as each scene is well-constructed to deliver an inevitable laugh, without the premeditated one-liners that seem so forced in today's trash comedies. The events of the film were based on Producer Bob Israel's real life bachelor party experience, and the realism of the story can be felt in the film, as the viewer rarely has to suspend disbelief.  This movie can best be appreciated by the movie fan who enjoys witty, smirk-inducing comedies such as Porky's, Animal House, Police Academy, Summer School, and Weekend At Bernie's.

That's all blah-blah-blah. I looked it through this evening, and I can't even say how many times I've already seen it.  None of the modern US comedies could be compared to Bachelor Party. They are all uninteresting and pure in humour. It makes me think how free were american movie-makers in 80's - they could do and allowed to say everything they wanted. I'm not American and the modern comedies for teens I watch now forced me to believe that as a genre comedy is dead in US.   That's why I advise you to watch this movie, old but full of jokes about sex, crazy parties and true love, that means keeping promises.

Naturally, all of his plans to ruin the party are foiled by the motley crew.Most of the gags in Bachelor Party are tasteless, but that's half of the fun. Not really recommended to devout Christians, but those with open minds will either find this film infectiously silly, or just stupid. It's a nice reminder of what film makers could get away with in the 80's, though. American Pie, it's nearest competitor, is too glossy and slick to be a proper Hollywood soft porn flick. It also has too much of a heart.

Splash had been a success by now so the marketers could rely upon his newly-created status to promote Bachelor Party, and it paid off -- this movie was an unexpected hit when it came out (albeit a small one).Tom Hanks is a fine actor but I have to say that he had a certain charm about his acting that made many mediocre '80s comedies -- including Turner and Hooch, The 'burbs and of course Bachelor Party -- immensely likable despite their flaws.Yes, this is a crude, lewd, rude movie but it has its fair share of embarrassing moments, laugh-out-loud segments and cheesy (but fun) segments. Good entertainment for a Friday or Saturday night, and a good glimpse at a much younger, thinner, more comedic (and slapstick) Tom Hanks before he got all weepy-eyed and serious on us.

Not that I mind the movies that he does now days of course but it at the same time is also a waste of his comical talent.The movie also tries to feature some more serious elements, that concentrated on what it means to be married. Not that this works out horrible for the movie but it of course is also distracting a bit from what the movie is really truly about; simple immature comedy. Further more there is very little story actually and it simply features on the events during and around a bachelor party.The movie is so silly, simplistic and immature that you just can't help being entertained by it all.

The movie has a great soundtrack and Adran Zmed really wails on Little Demon as the craziness occurs around him. Hanks' character, no matter how nuts he seems to act, turns out to be quite, sensitive and reserved as he hides in a corner and finally retreats to a back room as his buddies keep having the fun, but they keep dragging him back into it. For my tastes, Tawni Kitaen, now or then, is not much of a beauty, but Wendi Jo Sperber (Tom's Busom Buddies co-star) is also on hand as his sister-in-law. This movie does win the Scary Movie award for unnecessary sex jokes, but the scenes at the photo studio, the garage and the 3-D theatre are some of the funniest.

The father of the bride to be also tries to stir the pot a bit too. Well the party starts out rather slowly as the dirty movie has been censored and things are looking rather dull until one of Hanks' buddies finally comes through with the hookers and all bets are off. Drugs, nudity, and donkeys are all the rage!!! Yes, this movie is crazy and your basic sex comedy of the 1980's, but it is also one of the better ones of the era. I like it a lot more than Tom Cruise's Risky Business as that one takes itself to seriously at times while this one stays light and funny all the way through to the climatic battle in the movie theater where a gal gets punched in the face and thinks it is the 3-d.

Very pleasantly surprised to find that it really was still funny, even if Hanks himself is so over the top that it makes the central storyline (Tawny Kitaen wants to marry him) unbelievable. Its silly, low brow, and yet exuberant and consistently funny throughout.

About a year after that it happened to come on HBO one night while my parents were out for the evening, so I excitedly sat down to watch this forbidden fruit. I laughed my ass off for the entire movie, of course, and the experience was heightened by the knowledge that if Mom and Dad came home before the movie was over and caught me watching it, they would've kicked my butt. Fortunately the film ended before they returned, so I got away with my little indiscretion. That's my main Bachelor Party memory and why the film remains so special to me all these years later.Seeing it again after a quarter of a century (! has it been that long?) I was confronted with a blast of nostalgia. Bachelor Party is now a true time capsule of the '80s and as soon as it started I was transported back to my junior high days. Hard to believe that Tom Hanks -- yes, THE Tom Hanks -- got his start in goofball comedies like this, Volunteers and the sit-com Bosom Buddies before becoming an award winning serious actor. Hanks is likable in just about anything, and Bachelor Party is no exception. His character, a goofy slacker named Rick who drives a school bus for a living, has somehow lucked into marrying the gorgeous Tawny Kitaen (who would become famous a few years later for her turn in several Whitesnake videos, then infamous after that for her drug and alcohol fueled activities), to the horror of her rich parents. Rick's party-animal friends (including Adrian Zmed of Grease 2 and T.J. Hooker fame) want to send Rick off into married life with the bachelor bash to end all bashes, and so the characters descend on an upscale hotel suite with all the class of a horde of Vikings on the attack. The party has all the sleazy trimmings you'd expect (drugs, hookers, booze, porn, strippers, etc.) plus a few hilarious asides such as a pimp who looks like Gandhi and a well endowed male stripper who goes by the stage name Nick the Dick. Rick's fianc√©, afraid that he will be unfaithful to him during said party, decides to crash the proceedings with her friends, leading to predictable '80s raunch-comedy chaos. (A naked guy hung out of the hotel window! A Marilyn Monroe lookalike stripper who turns out to be a guy in drag! A cocaine-snorting donkey that dies of an OD!) I laughed just as hard as I did when I was a teenybopper! This movie still holds up as one of the best low brow comedies of the 80s, if not of all time. Rent this one and give your inner 14 year old the time of his life!

There is a sequence near the end in a theater which borrows it's setting from some earlier comedy films but puts a different spin upon theater reality. Once in a while, this sequence shows up in some places as an example of a great movie comedy sequence as it is that good.Critics were too snooty to give this film much of anything positive because it is not a film for the kiddies, but even though some of the gags fall flat depending on the viewer, there are enough gags that hit the target that this is a pretty indecently delicious piece of entertainment.

Rick promised Debbie he'd remain faithful to her, but this isn't enough... she along with her bridal shower disguise themselves as hookers in order to infiltrate the party and to spy on Rick.I'm not the biggest fan of the comedy genre, as I usually find the labelled films to be bland, repetitive and stupid on top of everything else (Particularly the efforts of the previous decade). However, I was willing to give Bachelor Party a chance because it starred a young Tom Hanks, and was made in the 80's... That decade was a gem for films of all genres. Due to a series of mishaps and uncontrolled events, I ended up watching this film twice in two nights. Don't ask... but although I found it to be enjoyable enough in places, it feels tremendously long and boring and times with more than one scene and phrase being churned out over and over again to the point that the repetition is reminder of the vomit we've been subjected to in recent years. Tom Hanks is surprisingly good as the goofy, immature party animal, and the supporting cast are pretty good as well, although in saying that, their roles weren't exactly asking them to do much. Michael Dudikoff (Platoon Leader) is amongst the supporting cast. Overall, this is a very stupid and macho film (But what else would you expect?) with a typical happy ending.

Worried that Rick will be unfaithful, Debbie and her friends leave their own bridal shower to go to a strip club, and then to crash the bachelor party. Rick must resist his temptations, and deal with a psychotically jealous ex-boyfriend (Robert Prescott), a transvestite hooker, a mentally unstable school friend, and a coked-up donkey.When I watched this I really felt in the mood for a bit of 80's cheese. The sex/teen comedies that came out in that decade were hugely successful, and were usually funny in a guilty way. Films such as Porky's and Fast Times At Ridgemont High managed to balance gross-out humour, coming-of-age, and an odd vein of sweetness to good effect. Bachelor Party, however, is an unfunny, offensive and appallingly crude journey into the mind of jock-mentality.90 minutes of a group of middle-aged men with bad haircuts and even worse fashion sense grope and drink to excess does not a good film make. Apparently the idea of the film came from the director and the majority of the crew attending a similar bachelor party. I couldn't imagine a more nightmarish prospect. Apart from the odd funny line - Gentlemen, start your boners! - this is desperately devoid of ideas and inspiration. And Tom Hanks' character is one of the most annoying in cinema history. He plays tennis with his fianc√© and his future in-laws and repeatedly hits the ball out of the court laughing like a child. Debbie's father hates him, and we're supposed to think he's a stuffy old man. If I had a daughter that was considering marrying someone like Rick Gassko, I'd throttle the both of them in their sleep.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com "},{"Title":"A Classic That Just Didn't Work For Me","Date":"9 May 2010","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" Bachelor Party (1984) ** (out of 4) A man (Tom Hanks) announces to his buddies that he's going to get married in a week so obviously they decide to throw him a bachelor party (as well as try to talk him out of it). This is yet another post NATIONAL LAMPOON'S ANIMAL HOUSE flick where it's dumb, obnoxious, stupid and it doesn't care. As you'd expect, the R-rating is certainly reached for and achieved through a variety of profane language, silly sexual situations and of course plenty of nudity. The movie gets off to a good start but I thought it slowly got out of control with some of the side plots and in the end I really didn't find it as funny as many do. It's clear many consider this a classic of 80s comedies but I personally wouldn't go that far. I think the biggest problem I had with the film were the characters. I can't say I enjoyed any of them nor did I find any of them funny. Sure, there are a few laughs here and there but for the most part I was sitting there rather bored and just waiting for the film to end. Which is pretty much another problem since this thing clocks in at nearly 110-minutes, which is way too long. I think the main reason to tune into this thing would be for the young Hanks who you'd never tell by watching this that he would end up winning two Oscars. I guess the same thing could be said for Sean Penn in FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH but then again you could strike this up as their talent for being able to play characters like these. I think Hanks gets to show off some of his comic timing and he certainly has a few funny bits playing the smart jerk. I thought some of the best moments happened early on when he's going after his future father-in-law who hates him. The rest of the cast were pretty bland to me but then again I think most of this has to do with the screenplay and not their performances.

Rick has just got himself engaged to the horror of all his pals, so they decide that before he loses his freedom forever that he should be sent off in style. Needless to say that this includes plenty of alcohol, drugs and the occasional naked female.It's appalling to think that Tom Hanks had to start out so low before making a name for himself as a truly fine actor. As for the rest of the cast (including Adrian Zmed and Tawny Kitaen), they progressed just as far as their collective talents would take them, nowhere.As for Bob Israel's story (adapted to the screen by Neal Israel and Pat Proft), it isn't enough to describe it as bad taste. Even the foul comedy is foul, and the camp humour just isn't funny. Only one slightly humorous scene comes of this movie, involving a group of Asian gents who finally get some 'Bonzai'.Please spare yourself this awful movie experience.

Throw in an obnoxious nerd named Cole, who is also in love with Debbie and adored by her father, who can't stand Rick, you have all the makings of a classic comedy.Don't get me wrong, this film is no classic...the actors playing Rick's buddies, including GREASE 2's Adrian Zmed, give forced and over-the-top performances that tend to grate and when the actual bachelor party happens, it's not nearly as raunchy as we are expecting, but this film does have a lovely leading lady in Tawny Kitean as Debbie, fun supporting performances from Robert Prescott as Cole and George Grizzard as Debbie's father, but more than anything else, this film brilliantly showcases the commanding comic presence of Tom Hanks, who appears in just about every scene and never makes you regret it. Usually in a film like this, the leading man plays straight man to his supporting players, but Hanks is the show here and makes this not-so-great comedy seem a lot better than it really is. "},{"Title":"THE Funniest Movie I've Ever Seen","Date":"9 November 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" I often compare Bachelor Party to the Hangover movies to illustrate the right way and the wrong way to do a raunchy comedy. Then again, the Hangover movies did a lot more box office biz, so what do I know? The Hangover is a crude and raunchy attempt to be funny. Bachelor Party was also crude and raunchy..along with being infinitely more clever and laugh out loud funny. The first time I watched it all the way through I wondered if it was physiologically possible to literally bust a gut from laughing so hard.Rick Gassko (Tom Hanks, who was never funnier), a wise cracking bus driver for a Catholic school, is about to get married to rich girl Debbie (Tawny Kitaen), and her parents are none too thrilled about it. Neither is her anal-retentive, rich ex boyfriend Cole, who's still obsessed with her (at one point he ultimately offers Rick his new Porsche in exchange for Debbie). Rick's hard partying friends don't much like that their buddy is settling down either. They want to make sure Rick goes out in style, and throw him the bachelor party to end all bachelor parties at a super swank hotel, complete with hookers. This prospect doesn't sit too well with Debbie, and she forces Rick to promise he won't cheat on her. All kinds of wild stuff ultimately ensues..including an outing to Chippendales (where the gals in his fianc√©e's bridal shower end up showing up..and the guys subsequently pull a prank on them), a donkey that arrives in disguise, a hilarious exchange with a Hindu pimp, and Cole taking pot shots at Rick with a crossbow from an adjacent hotel.A number of things work in Bachelor Party, starting with a really funny script (supposedly this was at least partially based on the real life bachelor party of one of the writers). Something else this movie achieved was that it drew me right into what was going on. I actually felt like I was right in the middle of this epic bachelor party with Rick and his wacky friends, for whom depravity and debauchery are virtues. But the centerpiece is Hanks, who took what could have easily been a shallow character and made him three dimensional. Rick shows genuine worry about the prospect of perhaps cheating on his fianc√©e, and also shows concern over Brad, one of his friends at the party, who believes in better living through chemistry..while at the same time is suicidal over the breakup of his own marriage. But mostly he's an irrepressible wise ass (i.e. picking up the school kids Sister, you look terrific today! What have you done with your hair? Later, over the bus intercom Attention passengers, we are now leaving nun central on our journey to hell and beyond. The captain has turned off the no smoking sign, and you may now move about the cabin freely. Thank you for being Catholic, and for choosing the St. Gabriel school bus).The guys who round out Rick's motley bunch of friends are perfect in their respective parts, particularly Adrian Zmed, who plays Rick's best buddy O'Neil and is damn near as funny as Hanks. The female characters (along with Debbie's father and the aforementioned Cole) are overall a humorless bunch..which makes the guys' antics that much funnier.Some pretty raunchy and potentially dark stuff happens in this movie, which might have even offended my sensibilities had it been handled wrong, from Brad's suicidal tendencies (which had the potential to not be funny at all) to what happened with the aforementioned donkey. But even the really crude stuff was handled deftly, in a way that left me laughing rather than cringing (conversely the Hangover mostly made me cringe). Again, it's Hanks' flawless comic timing which ultimately makes this film. There are one or two scenes where I'm sure he improvised dialog. Warning This movie is raunchy..lotta nudity and graphic sexual references, and definitely deserving of its R rating. And there are elements about it which by today's standards are a bit dated. But this is one funny movie..they don't make 'em like this anymore, alas.

Her old boyfriend Cole Whittier (Robert Prescott) aims to break them up. Her parents don't like him either. His brother Stan (William Tepper) is coming along eager to get away from his wife Tina (Wendie Jo Sperber). They invite drugged up Brad Peckerhead Mollen.This is a simple Tom Hanks vehicle. The problem is that he doesn't have good enough partners to play with. Tawny Kitaen is a reasonable hot good girl. There are some fun scenes. Hanks hitting tennis balls over the fence. The male stripper with the fake hot dog is hilarious. The party getting out of control is fun. The Oingo Boingo song is catchy. These are good individual scenes. There needs to be more of them. It should get to the group bachelor party sooner. At least, the group has some limited comedy bromance chemistry. Adrian Zmed is not good enough to be the best friend. Gary Grossman is good as the funny nerd. The rest of them are acceptable as the boorish friends. Robert Prescott is great as the douche ex. As far as 80s raunchy comedies go, this one isn't too bad.

Crammed with all the hallmarks of party films from that decade - glaring fashion choices, oodles of saxophone, frequent gratuitous nudity and tons of recreational drugs - it's wafer-thin and proud. The title pretty much tells you all you'll need to know about the plot, which frees up the rest of its running time to go nuts with blasphemous humor and increasingly inebriated acts of questionable legal standing. It's a perfect fit alongside the wild-eyed greats of its generation; Caddyshack, Animal House and Revenge of the Nerds, make some room. Tom Hanks sometimes presses too hard to look crazy, unruly and cool, and often leaves us wondering how anyone could agree to marry such a slob (this may be the first time I've ever agreed with the pensive father-of-the-bride in this kind of movie), but when the music starts blaring he makes for a great master of ceremonies and that's really what the role called for.

The humour in this movie isn't for everyone, but if you're not offended by the sex jokes, misogyny, S&M, and bestiality, then you won't be able to watch this movie without laughing your head off.My favorite scene in the film is where Debbie's ex-boyfriend gets hog tied by Rick and his friends and they proceed to hang him out the window of the hotel by his bed sheets stark naked.  The sheets eventually come undone from the footboard of the bed and he falls several floors while screaming and lands a** first through the roof of a car occupied by a couple who, about to kiss, wind up putting their lips right to his hairy butt.  Not many movies have a scene like that in them.Tawny Kitaen is an interesting choice as Hank's love interest.  Her lion's mane of red hair being her standout feature that sets her apart from the usual blonde, siliconed (Pam Anderson) looking leading lady in most films of this genre.

I'm thinking Tom Hanks scratched this one of his resum√© long ago, along with Dragnet and Volunteers. I delight in the notion that some folks who love Hanks from films like Saving Private Ryan and You've Got Mail might stumble onto this puppy and give it a shot based on more recent work. Boy are they in for a shock. Even this early, in 1984, it's obvious Hanks had the capability of spinning gold from pewter. Because the script is nothing more than an endless series of low-brow gags and d*ck jokes. But in Hank's hands, it all comes out much better than you'd think.I think the second-most famous person in this film is either Tawny Kitaen or Adrian Zmed, so what does THAT tell you? (By the way, think they get Christmas cards from Hanks?) But the odd assembly of buffoons and horndogs here team up to do some surprisingly funny work.Sometimes I'll take one scene and let it sum up a movie's entire mindset. I can definitely do that for this flick In the middle of a donkey show at the bachelor party, the donkey wanders off, snorts a lot of coke, munches a bunch of pills and drops dead of a massive coronary on the spot.So ask yourself this Am I the type of person who thinks a sex-show donkey OD'ing on blow and pills is funny?

Naturally, things go barreling out of control.  It's incredibly tasteless (although somewhat tame compared to today's movies), silly and full of female (and male!) nudity...but damned if I wasn't laughing!  Most of the humor comes from Tom Hanks who's (I assuming) ad-libbing his lines left and right.  Very 80s in terms of clothes and hair.  Brainless but fun.  A perfect example of an R-rated 1980s sex comedy that would get an NC-17 rating today.  Also interesting to see Hanks pre-stardom.  Turn off your brain and enjoy!

Tom Hanks is hilarious in this film. His female co-star, Tawny Kitaen, is a great match for Hanks. They have a chemistry with each other, and play off each other well. This movie is quite crude, but what else can you expect from a bachelor party? Hanks is the only well-known celebrity of today to star in this film. I don't think this takes too much away from the movie, however. This movie is enjoyable. Try it out sometime!

Judging Hanks' early film performances has usually been negative. This 1984 20th Century Fox release, an obvious rip off of National Lampoon's Animal House was Hanks' first starring role. The film's heavy amounts of gratuitious raunchiness take away any possible sense in the storyline. However, Hanks may have most likely needed the work so this film is notable only as being a training ground for his much better subsequent films.
