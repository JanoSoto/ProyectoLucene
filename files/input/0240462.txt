[{"Title":"Innocuous and mildly entertaining, but overall forgettable","Date":"20 August 2001","Score":"7 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Fantasy","Review":"  Dr. Dolittle 2 is pretty much what you would expect out of a family comedy, only a tad more crude.  We could've done with maybe one less gag about animal urination.  The plot is a pious, predictable one involving the preservation of an endangered species of bears.  You know, one of those storylines that's supposed to deliver a message to all the young ones out there.Like usual, we have the talking animals voiced by a variety of celebrities. Steve Zahn lends his voice to one of the lead animal characters.  He's actually quite funny at times, as a bear/circus performer who's overcome by stardom, and now that he found out he's part of an endangered species he has to learn how to live like a normal bear  start hibernating, eating fish, etc.  Lisa Kudrow is the voice of his love interest.  Michael Rapaport is funny as a racoon who's the henchman of an alleged animal Mafia.Since the Dolittle's daughter (Raven-Symone) is all grown-up, we have to expect the obvious romantic subplot in which she hits puberty and engages in an active dating life.  Her father, naturally, has doubts about her new supposedly rebellious boyfriend (Lil' Zane).  So we're dragged through that unnecessary subplot, which pretty much serves as filler to complete a running time of 100 minutes.Lately, Eddie Murphy has been tackling PG projects like this and Shrek. A few years back, he took a try at cleaning his act when doing a voice-over for Disney's Mulan.  Then again, in the flop Holy Man.  I have to admire him for showing his more sanitized approach to comedy.  Despite his inability to use the f word, he proves he's still a multi-talented comedian and not a talented comedian whose act is totally watered-down and dull because of being forced to clean up his mouth.  Though he pretty much plays the straight man (I also have to admire him for his discipline, in remaining subdued and in character rather than viewing the movie as no more than a showcase for his comedy), he still belts out some witty one-liners and proves to be just as funny as his animal companions.I don't really have any strong opinions about this movie.  It's harmless, but it could've used a major rewrite.  It's funny at times, but could've been a lot funnier (and less crude).  Don't worry, you won't be seeing any gags involving birds crapping into people's mouths or a thermometer getting stuck into a dog's behind.  The film has just enough crudeness to achieve the PG rating, but we still could've done without it.  Your kids will be rolling in the aisles, while the adults may want to take a few popcorn and bathroom breaks.  Not bad (especially for a sequel), but forgettable and even somewhat dull.  You're better off catching this one on video.My score  6 (out of 10)        "},{"Title":"hard to say","Date":"30 July 2001","Score":"9 out of 12 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Fantasy","Review":"  If you like these kind of movies, then its funny.

Plus, I usually hate these sort of schmaltzy films, and so the fact that I liked it is a bit unusual and says something about it. I think the biggest reason was that they did NOT attempt to recreate the famous Doolittle novels or re-create the Rex Harrison film but boldly took the character in other directions in both Doolittle films. Plus, unlike Murphy's first Doolittle film, this one had a very nice infusion of humor--and I THOUGHT, incorrectly, that I would hate all the talking animal nonsense (just like I hated LOOK WHO'S TALKING). While this little film won't change your life, it's a decent film that won't insult your intelligence and will give you a few good laughs.Also, while I have seen enough of That's so Raven because of my kids, Raven Simone did a lovely job in the film--proving she's not just a cute flash-in-the-pan child actress.

It's one of my favourite movies.  So when I heard about the sequel I couldn't wait for the DVD.  I shoulda waited even longer. There is so many things wrong with this movie that I'm amazed anyone would say this is better than the first.  Only one thing saved this movie from total destruction.  And that's the character of Charisse.  Who we learn is beginning to have this thing called Dr. Dolittle's talent. It saved it from being a total waste of time.  I'll probably go buy it now. (Thank God for online rentals!!)  Some of the humor I liked of course, but.....The bad is really bad.  First..continuity.  Okay.. Dr. Dolittle has ended and number 2 starts.  Did I miss something here?  They don't explain what happened to Rodney (the Guinea Pig) or how bout the baby Gator.  Hmmm perhaps the Gator ate Rodney and they deemed it not to the liking of family entertainment.  Two... they shift the focus off the fact that Dolittle is a doctor.  There's a time for an environmental movie and there's not a time for it.  This wasn't the time.  Imagine ER suddenly became a tv show about what George Clooney does in his spare time.  Eddie shoulda been doing what he does best.  Doctoring.  At least have it so the bear needed physical help, instead of the instructional video on bear mating.Finally.. at the end of the first movie we are left knowing that it doesn't take riches to get places in one's life.  Great moral feeling here.  The bad guys were rich.  So guess what... The second movie  Dr. Dolittle is now a rather rich doctor.  Lives in a mansion with a push button gate.This movie doesn't even try to be a family movie.  It's doesn't try anything.  It takes the old lets do an environmental movie to save face trick.PS We really needed to rely on the fact that Charisse has bigger (ahem) than Britney Spears.   Which reminds me.  they cared more about bringing the old actors in for continuity.  But I think they forgot this movie is about animals first and foremost and totally forgot about the first movie.

I liked it when I was twelve years old, so I was curious to know what I would think after growing up, despite having low expectations. My expectations were surpassed slightly, but if I had never seen Dr. Dolittle 2 before, its predecessor wouldn't have been enough to make me interested in seeing it, but I did see it about four years ago, and enjoyed it. I was seventeen, past this movie's targeted audience, but didn't tend to watch a lot of movies at the time. I just watched this sequel again, and my once again low expectations were not surpassed at all.Dr. John Dolittle has become famous for his ability to communicate with animals, but lately, he has also been having trouble with his family. One day, he is brought to the forest to see the Godbeaver, and learns that the forest is rapidly being cut down. The animals who live in this forest are counting on Dr. Dolittle to save their habitat, and in order to do so, the doctor must attempt to get a female Pacific Western bear in the forest named Ava together with a male so he can save the species! He gets a male bear of this species named Archie from a circus, and begins his attempt to get him adjusted to life in the wild and teach him how to win Ava's heart, both of which are easier said than done! It doesn't help that Archie has to compete with a Kodiak bear named Sonny, and logging company owner Joe Potter is determined to get his way! Although I found no huge laughs in Doctor Dolittle, I did find some minor ones. However, in this sequel, I found none. I smiled at times, but VERY rarely and briefly. Like its predecessor, Dr. Dolittle 2 contains some juvenile excretion jokes, though it is a TAD cleaner, for better or worse (since it was aimed at kids, many would probably say it's for the better). These jokes are usually lame, if not always, a good example being the scene where Archie has diarrhea. There are also some embarrassing lines in the script, such as the one Dr. Dolittle has, humiliating his daughter, Charisse by telling her boyfriend how she tried to get out of diapers early and made messes around the house. Fortunately, the movie isn't totally filled with these problems, but most of the film is basically average and forgettable in my book.Both Dr. Dolittle films starring Eddie Murphy are rather cheesy, and would definitely appeal to kids more than anyone else, but this one more so than the original. If you don't like the 1998 film, then you probably wouldn't like this one, either, but if you do, then you STILL might not like this sequel. Dr. Dolittle 2 may have a slightly better plot than its predecessor, but overall, it is inferior, not that I'm saying the original is really that good. If you ask me, 1998's Doctor Dolittle is very close to being strictly for kids, and this sequel is right there. Remembering the film's targeted audience, I guess it deserves some credit, but if you're not part of that audience, and are not a parent of anyone who is, I wouldn't say there's any need to bother. After watching this, I definitely won't be watching the straight-to-video Dr. Dolittle 3.

Yet, Eddie's new take on the man who can talk to animals spawned a sequel.  I found Part 2 a bit better than Part 1.  The funniest lines come from the animals.  But still, this movie wasn't perfect.

He arrives home to discover that his oldest daughter doesn't wish to celebrate her birthday. He promises his family a trip to Europe but ends up answering a call to a forest where a beaver frets about it being cut down. To save it there must be an endangered species and Archie the circus bear is just that. Dolittle must make chemistry between Archie and a female bear but there are those whom are out to sabotage the event. Perhaps they should have sabotaged the entire film. Idiotic conclusion has all the animals banding together against the villains. Director Steve Carr fares okay but creates a film only marginally better than Next Friday. For a film aimed at families one must wonder why all the crude humour. Eddie Murphy does what he can with what amounts to a re-take. Supporting roles certainly don't rise above conventions. It features Jeffrey Jones, Kevin Pollack and Kyla Pratt among others and none of them had anything worth showing up on set for. Murphy even learns that one of his daughters has the gift for gab with animals and she seems more uncomfortable with that than the fact that the film she is in sucks.

Basically Dr. John Dolittle (Eddie Murphy) has now become renowned for his gift to talk to animals, in fact there isn't a day when they don't come to him for help, which annoys his wife Lisa (Kristen Wilson), and he tries to keep an eye on his daughters Charisse (Raven-Symoné) and Maya (Kyla Pratt). John does find out that Charisse plans to spend her sixteenth birthday with her date Eric Wilson (Lil' Zane), so he insists she brings him home to celebrate properly, but of course an animal informs him he is needed by the God Beaver (Richard C. Sarafian). He is told that the forest he and numerous other animals are living in is slowly being torn down by wood cutters, and the only way to save the few thousand acres left is to convince the authorities there is an endangered species living there. So John comes up with the idea to save the forest by reintroducing a trained bumbling circus brown bear named Archie (Tank the Bear, voiced by Steve Zahn) into the wild, to mate with a wild female Pacific Western bear. So Archie is taken to the forest and it is clear quite quickly that he isn't used to the environment he hasn't been in since birth, so the Doctor has to teach him a few things first. Then they spot female bear Ava (Lisa Kudrow), who he is smitten with but is failing to gain her interest or attention in having a relationship. With a little help from the other animals in the forest they teach Archie to have confidence and be romantic, and ultimately become the brown bear he should be. Meanwhile in his own life, John tries to make peace and eldest daughter without the talking to animals thing getting in the way, while also trying to stop mean Joe Potter (Jeffrey Jones) taking down the forest. Archie does manage to sway Ava by retrieving a seemingly impossible to get bees nest full of honey, but John might be too late to convince the authorities they are actually going to mate. So to stop the forest destruction once and for all, thousands of animals around the world are seen going on strike, so dogs won't go walking, race horses don't run, killer whales won't perform, birds poop all over Potter and his colleague, and much more besides. In the end, John and the animals do save the forest outside of San Francisco from destruction, and Archie and Aav did indeed mate to have three cubs together.

Being someone who loves animals, I rented Ace Ventura When Nature Calls and Dr. Dolittle 2 just for the heck of it (the former because I think Jim Carrey is hilarious but had avoided that particular title out of fear of it being a disappointment, the latter because I was interested in seeing the talking animal effects).  After loving the first title far better than expected, I had the pleasure of writing it up with compliments here for other IMDb readers.Dr. Dolittle 2, however, was a flop for me.Now, I do have to admit that I was basically prepared to be disappointed for this one the same way I was with When Nature Calls. I grew up with the beloved original Dr. Dolittle movie starring the talented Rex Harrison and adored the original books. I was absolutely convinced that this movie would be a dumb attempt to cash in on the original and make it marketable and hip in that lousy, gross-out way that only Hollywood marketing executives can when digging for dollars. But I watched it anyway, hoping that I could at least enjoy the talking animals, and I would have been spared a lot of headaches if only someone had been around to talk me out of this temporary lapse of better judgement.Let me start by saying that this movie has nothing to do with the original concept. Nothing. The animals talk and the main character has a famous name along with the ability to understand them, and it's there that any similarities end.How bad was this film? Let me put it this way it was a heap worse than I had anticipated, so much so that I shut it off two-thirds of the way in. It was simply too much of an embarrassment, and I found myself plotting to return it in the middle of the night after work when Blockbuster would be closed so no one would see me carrying it!The absolute worst problem with this film has to do with Eddie Murphy himself--a strong reminder of why he didn't have a hit film for something going on a decade. Simply put, he isn't likeable he plays this role the precise same way he has played nearly all of his roles, as an obnoxious Why do I have to be stuck in this position, I wish I was doing something else better with my time jerk who merely puts up with his dilemma. He also seems so ANNOYED in most of his movies.In the grossly overrated Beverly Hills Cop films, he was an annoyed cop who had to have everything his own way. In The Golden Child, he was an annoyed locator of missing children who put up with his job as well as his mission simply because he was stuck with it. Except for the occasional Mulan (the only performance of his I liked, by the way), he always whines, snarls, screams, curses and is generally pessimistic. And in this film, he is annoyed at the mere idea of being the world's most unique animal doctor.Eddie Murphy has managed to accomplish the impossible here--he has actually managed to make the idea of being able to talk to animals into a thoroughly unenjoyable and miserable routine. Simply put, he takes all the fun out of such a concept.What child HASN'T wanted to talk to animals? It was the one thing I wished I could do for as long as I could remember. If given the choice of any one magical ability (even if I were to include the ability to fly in a would-be list to choose from), it would easily be being able to converse with animals. But here, you get the impression that God simply plopped this amazing talent on precisely the wrong individual. Murphy doesn't even seem to genuinely *care* about animals--it's all an Okay, okay, I'll do it, but only because I feel like I have to and not because I have any heart for it sort of arrangement for him. All the while, what with that expression on his face, you keep expecting him to mutter, God, why ME? This is such a pain in the NECK!!! And in this attitude while conversing with the various animals on screen, he does everything except slap them with his I'm always right, so you'd better listen to me sharpness.There is something seriously wrong with a script when Dr. Dolittle is overly annoyed in dealing with, much more so being the only person on the planet able to talk to, animals.Here's my say if this material had to be remade at all, it should have at least been given to a comedian who could have worked wonders with its concept and genuinely enjoyed it. Imagine Robin Williams, or Steve Martin, or (you guessed it) even Carrey himself portraying this role. Heck, even the late John Candy. Any of them as well as dozens of others could have made this work because they have something which Murphy has always lacked--a sense of lightheartedness and joy when given the opportunity to work with fantastical and outlandish material.Watching this dreck, though, I seriously get the impression that Eddie Murphy picked the project simply because he knows he had nearly killed his own career with portraying annoyingly selfish, self-centered bores and wanted to do something to change his image into something lighter in an attempt to save it. Or at least his agent did. Whatever. All I have to say is--Eddie, if you want to convince us you can do something fun then you need to lighten yourself up first. Talking animal effects and potty humour do no automatically make you a whiz at family entertainment. Basically, you're just doing your same old Beverly Hills Cop personality routine with gimmicky windowdressing, and it doesn't work.But such a long review on my behalf was far better than this film deserves. If it weren't for the fact that I wanted to share my feelings on it with others, I would have otherwise simply written one line here I'll pass on this movie.

It made the good doctor look incompetent...I mean, he's supposed  to know everything about animals and then some. Otherwise, I liked the voice of Pepito the chameleon.  Something about his so young...so angry... speech still makes me laugh.

Well it's not that bad. Actually, this movie is rather funny and in a way better than the first one as the storyline was more interesting. Dr Dolittle 2 brings back Eddie Murphy as Dr. Dolittle. He has come to grips with his special ability to speak to animals and opens a practice devoted to helping animals as well as people. Not too soon into the movie, he is summoned by `The Beaver', a sort of God Father like creature of the local woods. Dr. Dolittle is asked for help, as the forest creatures fear that they will loose their homes to developers. So begins a journey where Dr. Dolittle tries to rehabilitate a circus bear in an attempt to have the forest declared a protected site by reintroducing a rare species of bear.What made this movie entertaining? Good writing and a bigger role for Eddie Murphy. The animal characters are also given some very humorous lines and the banter that exists between themselves and him are very cute. Also quite well done was the ability to capture the necessary expressions on the animals and the voice actors' abilities to deliver the lines appropriately. I particularly liked the relationship that existed between Dr. Dolittle and Archie the circus bear. If there was one thing that really took away from the movie, it was Raven Symone's performance. I watched this young lady when she started acting on The Cosby Show and after seeing this movie I wonder what happened. She seems to have taken a step backwards in her acting skills and to further take away from her performance, she is caked in makeup throughout the whole movie with the impression that she's got something better to do. Hopefully this isn't what to expect from her in future movies.Overall, the movie was pretty entertaining with most of the humor coming from Eddie Murphy and the animal characters.

Dolittle and his family take a vacation to a cabin in the woods where the bear would be set free; however the bear begins to realize that the wilderness is not his cup of tea, and wants to be back at the circus. The plot of the movie is all about this bear, and his daughter played by Kristen Wilson finds out that she too has a special gift like that of her father.(Eddie Murphy) It is a great sequel, just as good as the first.

Especially when it is Eddie Murphy attached to the film. Anyone remember &#145;Nutty Professor 2'? I sure do. Yet that horrible film has been erased from my memory with an even worse film, which also happens to be a sequel. Poor Eddie, just when he was getting hot again he is simply cashing in on his success with some really, really bad films. &#145;Doctor Dolittle 2' is just that type of film.  A forgettable, tepid, horrible film that manages to retain its' great qualities from the first film for only about the first 5 minutes.       Eddie Murphy stars as the world famous veterinarian who can talk to the animals. As a result, his life is completely abnormal as all animals try to see the Doctor in the worst of times. Yet, the plot in this film sees a &#145;Godfather' &#150; like Beaver ask Dolittle for his help in thwarting a logger's plan to destroy the forest in which they live in and turn into a new city. The only way to stop this from occurring is for Dolittle to have two Pacific Western Bears mate and produce an endangered species, thus stopping the project.        Talk about lame. This film goes downward right after the story shifts from the city to the woods as the film tackles many topics simultaneously. Dolittle must deal with the neglect of his wife, the neglect of his children and the stress of saving these animals from the evil loggers all while staying sane.        This is a classic example of a film that aims to be ambitious and falls flat on its face. Director Steve Carr had only one film under his belt before this film and it was &#145;Next Friday' which was much funnier than this. Unfortunately, &#145;DR2' fails on many levels and is simply put &#150; a bore. I must admire Director Carr for making this film as visual as possible though.  I am sure he knew he was tackling some pretty bad writing from Larry Levin and decided to make this film a tad more visual than its' successor.     Although he manages to sneak some good shots in, they do not save this bore of a film that makes you feel bad for Eddie, But don't, he is cashing in on us, so why feel bad? Yet, if he continues making fare such as this, he will return to his film hiatus that almost cost him his career a couple of years back. The visual effects for the animals are incredibly top-notch, yet they cannot sustain the lacklustre pacing that drowns this film.      No matter how many voices appear in the film such as Arnold Schwarzenneger, Michael Rappaport or Lisa Kudrow, this film isn't even worth writing about due to its' laziness to entice and entertain. Lastly, one more interesting point &#150; how does an actor like Kevin Pollak go from &#145;The Usual Suspects' to this? I know he is a stand up comic, but I am sure he has his limits. Yet, I am sure everyone involved was thrown a ton of money in order to ensure the film's 122$ Million Box Office Domestic Gross. This film cashed in on the summer family movie going crowd and surely left many with a strong distaste. The title is applicably attached to the film because Dr. Dolittle actually does little.Giancarlo's Rating *  "},{"Title":"Cute Little Film - Good Fun","Date":"3 November 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Fantasy","Review":"  I enjoyed this film very much.

Occasionally, you see a little hint on devilment in his eyes as if to say I could be doing my 'Delirious' routine in a heartbeat' but he never does. I have to wonder if this is the direction Murphy had in mind for his career.Murphy plays Dr. Doolittle, animal psychologist extraordinaire, who can supposedly translate animal talk. His task this time is to save a forest area slated for demolition by getting two endangered bears to make beautiful music together so the forest will be spared. In the process, he runs into various animals with various accents. They run the gamut from a Mafioso-like beaver to a wisecracking French monkey to an accent-laden chameleon who can't blend.Steve Zahn probably does the best job as Archie the circus bear trying to win over Ava, the born in the woods bear (voiced by Lisa Kudrow) over from her bohunk Kodiak bear boyfriend.Kids, frankly, will love the simple-minded humor and sight gags. My nieces were howling and they are 9 and 12. And some of it IS funny. But it does get old after a while and some of the plot holes are wide enough to drive a truck through. Murphy's family gets a very lame side plot. As Murphy's teenage daughter, Raven Symone shows promise but she needs some better material to work with.

His special gift has earned him worldwide credibility and international fame. Dolittle travels the globe meeting the particular needs of any species in any country. On the side, he also runs a group therapy session for canines stuck in animal shelters. Things start to get interesting when a gangster-esque raccoon approaches Dolittle and takes him to the woods to meet a beaver, the Godfather of this secret animal mafia. They need help. A powerful corporation is cutting down the trees in the forest. Without these trees, the animals have no homes. The creatures of the woods are calling upon Dolittle to stop this harmful deforestation. There is only one way to accomplish this. It seems an endangered species of bear roams free in the forest, however, there is only one left, a female named Ava. Saving the one bear is no longer probable, so the court cannot legally stop the corporation from tearing down the trees. The good doctor convinces the court to give him a month. In that time, he will find another bear of this species who is currently in captivity. Then, he will introduce him to the wild and successfully mate him with the female who currently lives in the woods. This would force the courts to prevent the greedy corporation from taking away the home of an endangered species. The plan sounds perfect, until Dolittle meets Archie, the pampered circus bear he must train to live in the wild.As with the first film, Dr. Dolittle 2 works because of a fresh and creative sense of humor. This stuff gets you laughing from the very beginning and does not let you stop until the very end. Most of this can be attributed to the voice talent, which includes incredible actors and comedians like Norm Macdonald (reprising his role as Lucky the dog), Michael Rapaport (who costarred with Murphy in Metro), Lisa Kudrow (Phoebe from television's Friends), and Steve Zahn (Saving Silverman and That Thing You Do!). They are the ones who bring the material to life. They are the ones who require expert timing and delivery. They are the ones who really get the audience laughing. Still, at the beginning of this movie, I still wondered if the premise would get tiresome. The talking animals are great, but I was not sure if their novelty would wear off by the film's conclusion. Quite frankly, the movie is too short for this to ever actually happen. At a light 81 minutes, Dr. Dolittle 2 is an easy flick to watch. The pace moves fast, the laughs never stop, and the movie is over well before it stars to drag.I could easily see Eddie Murphy hopping on board a third outing as John Dolittle, or even a fourth or fifth. Believe it or not, that's one thing I really enjoyed about Dr. Dolittle 2. It has long-lasting franchise potential, as proven right here. This movie does not feel like an average sequel. Rather, it comes across as another chapter in the continuing adventures of the man who could talk to animals.

The sequel begins with a raccoon gangster trying to recruit Dr. Dolittle into saving a forest that is going to be taken over by a lumber company. Dr. Doolittle takes the lumber company to court and an agreement is made if Dr. Dolittle can get the lone Western Pacific bear, Ava, to mate, the forest will be saved under the Endangered Species Act. Comedy and action ensues as Dolittle tries to introduce a circus bear, Archie, into the wild in order to save the forest.Director Steve Carr's intentions of this movie seems to prove anything can be possible if one puts effort into it. This is shown by Dolittle's attempts to reintroduce a bear which has been raised by humans back into the forest. Another example is when the animals perform various comic scenes of stopping forest destruction (both inside and outside forest), but with the more serious intentions of saving their home in mind. A different perspective from the director is the underlying idea explaining it is important to preserve the forests and their inhabitants. As seen in this movie, many animals, such as the Western Pacific Bear, are becoming extinct.While this movie had good intentions, in reality it was just a bad movie. The animals were cute, but many of the comedy scenes were trying a little too hard to be funny. This movie was supposed to be for kids, but there was a large amount of adult situations in this film. Excluding Eddie Murphy, most of the actors were extremely annoying thanks to corny dialogue and poor character expressions. The only positive about this movie were the themes; a little effort can go a long way and the importance of forest preservation. Dr. Dolittle 2 is a poor sequel and I would only recommend this movie to someone with a cheep sense of humor.

DOLITTLE 2 / (2001) *** (out of four)I am often cautious when I walk into a theater to screen a sequel, but even more so when it's the sequel to a family comedy. Family comedies are so lazy these days. Many filmmakers seem to think their target audience isn't analytical, therefore, they do not take the proper precautions. The 1998 hit Doctor Dolittle wasn't a great movie, but it was entertaining and amusing. Steve Carr's  Doctor Dolittle 2 is even better. The film works because it doesn't waste time explaining what we already know. It relies on the first film for the character development and circumstances, and also creates a story that stands on its own. The plot drifts a little here and there, but it's new material, not a duplication of Doctor Dolittle.  This is the kind of movie that revives this struggling genre.Eddie Murphy takes center stage again as Dr. John Dolittle, but he has a more important role in this film. In the original, he was upstaged by the talking animals; he simply reacted to their various crude and witty comments. Here, he's the main focus of the plot, thus, the film provides us with a stronger central character. I like the way the movie gives Dolittle dimension by incorporating his family into the story. We learn more about his wife (Kristen Wilson), and his lovely daughter Charisse (Raven-Symone), who learns of a new ability and forms a love interest with a young man. Some of these family aspects work well, and others fall flat. Charisse's relationship with her father is involving, but the subplot dealing with her boyfriend does not pay off.John Dolittle is a world-famous veterinarian who can talk with animals. The premise involves Dolittle's attempts to save a forest that is about to be leveled by a powerful forester (Jeffrey Jones). A slick attorney (Kevin Pollak) represents our enemy, while Dolittle recruits his lawyer wife to defend his case in court. Dolittle's only true argument depends on a protected species of bear. Unfortunately, there's only a single female bear who cannot reproduce by herself, so why save her habitat? But wait! There's a circus performer male bear of the same species. Dolittle rushes to persuade the animal to come to the wild and mate with the female bear, but will he want to leave his circus home?Doctor Dolittle 2 is not an extremely funny movie; its more amusing than hilarious. A lot of the film's humor comes off as surprisingly dual and annoying. Such humor evolves from a lizard's inability to blend with his environment, a canine's attempts to pick up a wolf, convincing the two bears to mate, and a monkey's drinking problems. These jokes lack the sharp impulse, the zest, the perfect timing, and the wit we encountered in the first film. Until the creative, prosperous final act, Doctor Dolittle 2 invokes very few laughs.Eddie Murphy supplies his character with the perfect amount of wit and energy. He is the funniest thing in the movie. The filmmakers decided to tone down some of the crude humor and sexual entendres to warrant the movie family-orientated PG rating. Murphy still takes advantage of the mildly risqué material present, however, as he makes the film more viewable and entertaining. The filmmakers learned from the first film, where Murphy was too passive and reactive. Here, they put him on screen whenever possible, and that's why Doctor Dolittle 2 is better than the original.

It was disgustingly unfunny and jerky. Rex Harrison never looked so good. The first Eddie Murphy Doolittle had all the same faults as this one, not the least of which was the smug voice of Norm McDonald as the dog. In fact, ALL of the animals are smug smart-alec put down artists with flip, condescending attitudes. Always a nasty conceited quip for any occasion. Is this supposed to make them likeable? Animals are loveable. I like dogs and birds and racoons as much as the next guy. I even think alligators are cute and lovable in their own feisty way, not that I want to swim with them. Animals are vulnerable and frightened easily. They aren't cocky and full of themselves. DOO 2 gave all of the animals a terrible personality.
