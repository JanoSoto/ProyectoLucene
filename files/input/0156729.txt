The impending catastrophe has been known about for months but nothing can be done about it.Government has been wound down. There's a certain amount of mayhem, looting, and bloodshed in the streets, but most of that ended weeks ago; now people are just quietly resigned. The nature of the disaster is never specified or even mentioned, but cleverly hinted at. Sooner or later you'll suddenly realise what it must be to do with, and when you do it's a breath-catching moment. Once you notice this, the closest thing the film has to a big special effect, it becomes increasingly appalling as time goes on.There are to be no last-minute attempts to save the earth. They were known to be futile before the film begins. Instead, people calmly make preparations for their last night alive. It's a bit like wanting to do something special for your birthday. Craig (Callum Keith Rennie) is living out the four-letter answer most people would give if asked 'What would you do if the world was about to end' - as he has been, methodically and systematically, for the past few weeks. Sandra (Sandra Oh) is trying to get across the chaotic city to her beloved husband. Patrick (Don McKellar, who also wrote and directed, brilliantly) attends a last family meal and plans a quiet evening alone with a Pete Seeger record. Almost everyone else is heading downtown for the big end of the world party.Flashes of black humour help make things bearable, but I can't convey how genuinely chilling and terribly moving the film becomes before the end. Pre-millennium there were a handful of end-of-the-world films, most based around big-budget special effects. For a grumpy misanthropist such as myself, who officially couldn't care if the world was to end, even a blockbuster disaster movie like Deep Impact was a salutary experience, making me realise that I really, really don't mean that, and that for all its travails and miseries life is precious. But by excluding special effects and scientific explanations, and precluding the possibility of averting the end, and focusing entirely on the human, Last Night is far, far better and left me drained and devastated.I almost prefaced these remarks with a 'Don't watch this alone' but decided, nah, other people can be a pain when you're trying to watch a film. But if you watch it alone and late at night as I did, be warned that after the end you may feel a strong urge to make contact with one of those annoying other people, at 2 in the morning, a friend, a relative, your milkman, anyone.But watch this you must, for it's a great cinematic work of art.

One person brought that people wouldn't be violent on the day when the world ends, but come together in a type of philosophical togetherness.  I was stunned by that idea, assuming that the cynicism that permeates today's culture would have enforced that idea, that violence will be around.  The end of the world is a violent thought, as exemplified in films such as Armageddon and Deep Impact (true, they were stupid films).      But that aside, Last Night is a powerful and very introspective look at the lives of several people who's lives happen to be interwoven on the last day of the world.  It begs the question what would you do with the final six hours.  Many have remarked on the tone, and I have to heap more praise on the subtle irony that is found throughout the film.  Why is the world ending?  The audience doesn't find out.  Whether one's appreciation of the film diminishes or grows for this ambitious step is purely personal.  For a ninety minute film, it's ambition in depicting six lives is interesting, and it's only mistake.  For the movie to do justice to all the characters, it needed to be at least half an hour longer.  But that singular flaw does not negate the film's final achievement.  The entire cast is sensational, even if they're on for short periods of time.  Rennie and Oh took home well deserved Genie awards for their brilliant performances, but I felt McKellar's performance was the most intriguing.  He has a talent for not poignant drama, but scenes of almost deadpan-type comedy (where Sandra asks him the favour).  Don McKellar has got to be among the most versatile writers around.  After writing Thirty-Two Short Films About Glenn Gould, the fragmented biopic about the famous pianist, and The Red Violin, another slightly fragmented story told through and about a violin, he wrote, directed, and starred in Last Night, and apocalyptic dramedy (or an ironic tragicomedy), and he does it with supreme style.  Last Night is a film not to be missed, but to be pondered over and savoured.

Taking place during the last night on earth, the film expertly follows the lives of a group of people all of whom are dealing with the end of the world in their own inimitable ways. Yes, this is not something original but somehow Mckellar (who also acts in the the film) has fashioned a very watchable tale whose power lies in what we know is going to happen rather than how we get there. With a touch of off-beat Canadian humor the mundane and the surreal are often counterpointed to provide some dark humor, but the film's visual wit and wonderful use of music adds another eerie dimension. Mckellar never tells why the earth is coming to an end but there are enough 'bright' clues to satisfy the curious. It's a shame this film hasn't had more exposure.

LAST NIGHT is wonderfully refreshing and intelligent. No cheap thrills or laughs. Nothing derivative or patronising to the audience. It has an integrity increasingly rare in modern cinema. Don't just 'forget Armageddon', it's misleading to even  compare them. A sense of impeding doom is treated here like a collective state-of-mind rather than an externalised visual spectacle.

Well, to start, I feel this is the kind of Canadian film we Canadians have been BEGGING to see for years.  However, because of the fact that the film saw limited release in arthouse theatres across the country, and is just appearing on video now, chances are good that Last Night will not be seen by a large majority of the public if not sent in to full release across the United States.This movie is Canadian -- without shoving the fact that it is down your throat.Now, on to the actual guts of the movie.  I find the understatement of the fact that the world IS ending in six short hours to be so uniquely Canadian. There is an odd, somewhat macabre scene in the movie where McKellar's character is being harassed by his mother for showing up late for Christmas dinner.  Not once does mother mention the end of the world.  McKellar's response?  ... and in case you haven't noticed the world is going to end today, and I've had a lot on my mind.Getting off my maple leaf waving-high-horse, I will say this  the performances by McKellar, Sandra Oh and Callum Keith Rennie are nothing short of superb.  They portray characters you at times love, hate, and fear, because there are times (many times) that we see ourselves in these characters.The soundtrack for Last Night (available on the Sony Classical label) is a mixture of both the corniest music on the face of the earth (Burton Cummings' live performance of Glamour Boy) to great oldies (Last Night I Didn't Get to Sleep at All) to songs few (if any people) have ever heard before (i.e. the Defranco Family's Heartbeat, its a Lovebeat)The story moves at a graceful pace, there are no surprise endings, and the characters are human(e).

Our main character, Patrick Wheeler is caught between fulfilling his parents plans and his own. I don't want to give too much of this simple, beautiful and heartfelt movie away, but I think it boils down to a question of opening ourselves up - to be less alone - and to let love in. I think that one thing Mr. McKellar is trying to say is that the power of love- true love (NOT lust) will get us through - no matter what the obstacle. I've seen this movie several times, and am the last person to be swayed by big Hollywood films that try to steer you to feel for their characters. Last Night is NOT an action picture.

Her character is married to a key figure in the story played by David Cronenberg, who just happens to be the best film maker Canada has ever produced. His plot is just as upsetting as everyone else's, although McKeller's rather sexy buddy seems to be having the most exhausting fun. He's going out in style with pleasure. Hint he even hits on poor gloomy Don for one last experimental thrill... tho Don wimps out and turns him down...Another great actress, Genevieve Bujold, plays a nice role in several stories.

There's always *something* about each work that bugs me a bit; but like the bit of gravel in your hiking boots that makes the trek that little bit more memorable, that little bit more real, I always wonder would I really have been happier without it?Last Night -- a subtle, oddly serene film about the world ending, not quite with a bang, not quite with a whimper -- but with a gently rueful, and very human, shrug -- is typical, in this regard. I more than merely like this film -- I believe I'd put it among my top ten favourite works, and I've seen a *lot* of movies -- but as a matter of honesty, I have to warn anyone who hasn't seen it yet, it does have more than a few rough edges.The acting's a bit uneven, and ranges from borderline painful to actually stunning; I find the occasionally hysterical mother played by Roberta Maxwell painfully cliched. Bujold, on the other hand, you just have to see. Oh is memorable, surprisingly powerful. McMullen I still can't make my mind up about. McKellar is, well, McKellar. I can't help liking the character, even if it does seem a manipulative kinda setup that makes it so.The script does amble a bit. It's kinda the nature of the story. And McKellar's fondness for clever, throwaway lines sometimes gets the best of him, in my view, both in his own part and in McMullen's.But these are minor flaws, forgivable (or, as above, perhaps necessary), in an otherwise actually brilliant piece of work.And overall, the writing, I have to say, is the best I've seen from McKellar yet. This a very delicately balanced script, marvelously restrained. Somehow, McKellar has made a movie in which regret, euphoria, and dread circle each other warily for an hour and a half, without melodrama once rising up out of the mix. There are believable moments of hysteria; they generally punctuate the prevailing current of reflection, resignation, and quiet desperation entirely believably and appropriately.The ending... I'm not breathing a word about the ending.Apart from this it's flawless.My vote see it.

An appropriate choice as the film showcases many scenes in the streets of Toronto. It's always a small thrill when watching a film that was shot on the street where you work or somewhere familiar.The reception for the film was extremely positive, but I guess it's fair to say that the audience was fairly biased. Nevertheless, it portrayed with equal amounts of seriousness and black humour the nature of humanity as it might act in the last hours of civilization as we know it. No fanfare, no 'splosions & lasers, no asteroids plummeting from the sky, no glossy veneer, in essence, a breath of fresh air.Part of what made Armageddon so unbearable to sit through was it's choppy editing and utter refusal to sit in one place for a moment and see how events affected those involved. The filmmakers were more interested in the number of action sequences rather than focusing on the story. Quite simply, compared to Last Night, Armageddon just seems like a multi-million dollar joke of a movie. I'm sure all those involved in it were amply compensated financially, but at what cost to their credibility?Deep Impact, another end-of-the-world epic, on the other hand, had a far stronger story element, whose only weakness can be found in the contrived youthful love story that defies interest on many levels. To its credit, Deep Impact features Morgan Freeman, who is a stunningly gifted actor who brings depth and credibility to everything I've seen him in. But Deep Impact is in it's heart, another action flick, and therefore not in the same category as Last Night.Last Night dares to delve into areas of the human psyche that neither of the other two films explore Denial. Insanity. Lust. Loneliness. Suicidal tendencies. Embracing nihilistic impulses. Utter chaos. Depression. Compulsion. You know, the finer things in life, the magic stuff of huge box office receipts. I guess it's fair to say that this film is not an upbeat, life affirming experience that is geared towards everyone.Last Night tackles an age old prophecy, the end of mankind, with an entirely fresh and innovative approach. It doesn't treat the viewer like a child that needs to have everything explained in detail. It really doesn't matter why or how the world is ending when nothing can be done about it anymore, now does it? The film's fade to white at the end stands as a perfect example of the ingenuity exercised.Without question, this film is more thought provoking and engaging than either of the other two aforementioned efforts. Given it's low budget and Canadian affiliation, it's also unlikely to reach the kind of audience that Deep Impact and Armageddon enjoyed on their opening weekends. You've really got to hunt for the gems sometimes.

Also anything that Cronenberg endorses piques my curiosity.But I found this dreadful, at the level of actor's workshop at the community theater. A couple situations had promise the mother's grasping at fantasy in the beginning -- the `make me love you so you can kill me' reasoning at the end. But it was inexpertly handled in all respects no element was notable, not the staging, writing, acting photography, sound design -- nothing. These elements are less important if the project has soul, but there is no energy here.For enthusiasts of independent film, I invite you to compare this with John Sayle's `Limbo,' which explores the same territory relationships and family-sex driven ritual under the threat of a great unknown, stressed by the environment, all developing toward an `end' ending. See how Sayles masters the various elements of the craft with an understanding of how to shape the effect. See how no movement seems contrived and as a result we are sucked into the emotional space. See how tone and style are controlled through the dance of the eye and the light. See how the actors understand the film's intent and live within it.And then watch for any inkling of that here; it just does not exist. The Canadian independent community has riches Cronenberg is a talented production designer and his `eXistenZ' was surprisingly multidimensional. Egoyan understands time folding in narrative at a world class level, possibly even beyond. Is the community so small and inbred that even the slightest talent is supported? Perhaps people just cannot afford to make enemies.I found two of McKeller's prior projects equally dreary and mechanical. `32 Short Films' had the burden of focusing on a soulless, mechanical performer and amplified that weakness. `Red Violin' missed every of the many opportunities presented to create something as powerful as the violin.I cannot recommend this.

If we knew it was absolutely the last night on earth and we had ample warning, how would we spend it? Some would spend time with family and friends. Others wouldn't wait until midnight. Some would spend it in church. Some would settle old scores either with apologies or with a gun. Others would spend it on a sexual free-for-all. Many, I suspect, would turn to violence and destruction - that is, if I now humanity the way I think I do.'Last Night' is an end-of-the-world scenario that examines how a group of individuals choose to spend their final hours on earth. Sandra (the wonderful Sandra Oh) spends all day trying to get back home to her husband Duncan (David Cronenberg) after her car is trashed by looters; Craig (Callum Keith Rennie) wants to spend the day living out all of his deepest sexual fantasies; Patrick (Don McKellar, the film's director) is a young widower who wants to spend his last evening at home listening to music; Sandra's husband Duncan owns the power station and spends his day waiting for Sandra by calling his customers to let them know that the power will remain on right to the end.Those personal stories set this movie apart from most films about the end-times which tend to portray the end of the world as a disaster movie, with falling buildings, mass hysteria, looting and hyper-active special effects. This film is quiet because it focuses on personalities. I can imagine Robert Altman directing a movie like this.It is directed instead by Don McKellar who shows a lot of restraint with this characters and his stories. The people act as real people would and talk as real people might. He sets the story in Toronto (this is a Canadian production) on an unknown date and never gives a reason for why the world is ending - the characters already know, so why sit around yapping about it? The sun never goes down, even at 10pm so we assume that the sun is about to go supernova (why exactly midnight is never revealed either). The mass looting has subsided because there is nothing left to steal. What looting remains only happens in the backgrounds of certain shots. There are no police anywhere and, we're told, the governments of the world shut down some time ago.Those details in place, this is simply a movie about personalities. The most intriguing is Sandra who, I think, represents most of us. She has an agenda (one that isn't revealed until the third act) and her face is a mask of frustration as she attempts to find some mode of transportation to get across town and back to her husband. She's played by the wonderfully underrated Sandra Oh who is one of the most relaxed and natural actresses. I've seen her in films like Sideways and Rabbit Hole but there she reveals a whole different level. What is waiting for Sandra when she gets back with Duncan is painful, but even more is the issue of not getting being able to back to him. She as a promise to keep to him and it is killer her that she cannot fulfill it.Nothing can bring about our faith nor our true nature like knowing that the end is near. That fact brings an odd unpredictability to Last Night because we get to know the characters but we wait to see the poignancy in their final moments. This is a sad film but not a maudlin one. The fact that director Don McKellar avoids the obvious melodramatic high point and just focuses on people and who they are makes the end of the film inevitable, unpredictable on a personal level and finally very touching.

Do you feel the same - that all these films involve us, as individuals, in the end of the world, either in literal, metaphorical or subjective sense? All these films ask tough personal questions from their viewers. What is YOUR answer?

You can have Deep Impact and Armageddon. Take 'em, and keep 'em. Last Night is far better, and frankly, I'm a little ticked that the Academy didn't give it anything. Don McKellar (a genius, by the way) wrote a beautiful script, and did the kind of directing job that you remember years later. This is also the first time I've ever seen a movie end by fading to white, and it was an excellent idea for an ending.I think the only weakness, if it qualifies as a weakness, is the wasting of Sarah Polley. I felt the film could have spent a little more time with Jennifer and her boyfriend. Sarah Polley is the kind of actor who can take an insignificant character, and make her into something more.Other than that, the performances were excellent all around. McKellar did a great job. When actors direct the films they're starring in, they're usually pretty weak. If you didn't know he was the director, you never would have guessed it. If Mr. McKellar makes a film half this good the next time he directs, he might get a chance to thank the Academy (that is, if there is any justice).One final note I don't think I've ever thought this much after watching a film. Obviously, everyone who sees this movie will be asking themselves what they would be doing on the last night. So, to everyone who has not yet seen it, get someone to watch it with you because you will definitely what to talk about it afterwards.

Bearing in mind what people are planning for their Y2K-celebrations one can't help but shrug at the conventionalist behaviour displayed by most of the characters in the movie with a notable exception played by Arsinée Khanjian (the lady in the tramcar).This film could have been a wonderful opportunity to explore the contrast between value-nihilism and ethics, but my subjective feeling is that this topic was given only fleeting attention The focus was on presenting a 'smorgasbord' of possible scenarios much like Robert Altman's Short Cuts, where I feel the movie would have been more interesting if it had concentrated on following one or two characters with the rest being displayed as 'value-nihilistic background noise' - a role which I feel the 'roaming crowds' did not live up to. They reminded me more of your typical high school graduation party on the loose (with guns, mind you).If one is interested in an alternative approach to portraying the contrast between value-nihilism and ethics, I would recommend Predrag Antonijevic's Savior (1998).

A friend and I were what we thought to be 15 minutes or so late, so stayed to watch the beginning of the next showing, but it turned out we had only missed about 5 minutes.  We had hoped, in vain as it turns out, that we would learn some context as to why/how the world was about to predictably end, cleanly right at midnight one day.  When we left shortly after we got caught up, it was a relief for me to leave behind this depressing and unbelievable film, literally a welcome breath of fresh air.The plot is simple - for some unknown reason, the whole world (or at least all humans) will come to an end at midnight, and if you listen carefully for just a few offhand and quick lines in dialogue, you will also note that this has been known for a few months and that night hasn't fallen in some time (how could this be?  Has the earth suddenly stopped rotating?  Would India be in total darkness if Canada is in total light?  Is the Western Hemisphere coming to an end??  Have people really given up? Who knows.).  What would you do if you knew for a fact that the world were about to end?  And had a few months to prepare for it?You have to abandon your credulity even further, as the characters portrayed are largely 2-dimensional and whose motives and actions make little sense. Some may choose quite contemplation (a few of the characters pray), some may go mad (as one mother seems to have), some may review their lives (as a family does), but is human character so evil and interested in senseless entropy as to engage in pointless violence and property damage, crass behavior, and the like?  I would think not - I would think that such a calamity would tend to make people introspective and to commiserate and hang together as a global community.Philosophical perspective aside, the characterization had no depth.  The camera techniques were mildly interesting, often involving shooting into hazy light, but the camera was not kind to the characters, making most of them look unflattering.  How could this have been called a comedic drama? It was depressing through-and-through and the drama was very weak, with there being no attempt portrayed to understand/overcome the demise - instead all is just a rather ineffective depiction of individual reactions to the impending doom.Rating 3 out of 10, though I'm wondering why I rated it so high - maybe because of some of the great songs from the 1970s (for example, I was delighted to hear Jimmy Loves Maryanne by Looking Glass of Brandy fame - I didn't know anybody knew this other song of theirs!)

Case in point, Don McKellar's Canadian knocking-on-Apocalypse's-door flick, Last Night. Throughout the film, I was wondering if there would come a point where the revelation as to why or how the End of the World was coming around. There isn't any, or at least something that has a clear definition. But there are eerie signs of something just 'off', and it comes with the mere presence of the sun at first I wasn't thrown off by the sun being out at 6 PM, even 7 PM (the time-span for Last Night is 6 hours, 6 PM to 12 AM on the dot)... but the sun doesn't set, it just stays there and doesn't go away. Now that's scary - and certainly convenient for a budgetary perspective.This is a low-budget movie that takes the apocalypse as something serious, but not in every single moment. In fact McKellar's approach is to make this at times almost 'quirky', eccentric, and even awkward comedy. At one point Patrick, character McKellar himself plays, is having a big dinner with his family and some old family friends. The mother starts to cry at the table, but no one really goes to console her or to say anything, they just keep on eating the turkey and lamb she's prepared - this is the kind of scene I might expect on the TV show Louie, where misery turns out to be uproarious comedy all based on the timing and the personality of the characters in this dreadful situation (in other words it IS a serious moment, but funny because of the reactions and how people feel about one another in that moment). And there's a whole sub-plot with a character who has been, over two months, going through sexual conquests like a check-list... and he finally approaches his friend Patrick about being a, uh, part of that.The main thrust of the story is how Patrick and Sandra (played by Sandra Oh, no name change apparently) go about their last 6 hours, with some assorted characters drifting in and out like Sarah Polley as one of Patrick's disaffected teenage siblings, and David Cronenberg as a bureaucrat going about his last business in a giant office to call people in this city to tell them about the gas staying on until 12 PM, with pretty much every call being a voicemail. But it's less about the story of it than just following these people and finding how they deal with this despair, or not deal with it, and while some go out in the streets and loot and kill and pillage (the film opens with Sandra's car being flipped over as she goes into an empty store to get some items for no good reason at all except it's apocalypse time, better flip some cars and stuff).There is some dramatic power here too, though in small doses and in large part coming from Sandra Oh's performance (I'd forgotten how good she can be, such as in Sideways or on the HBO show Arliss, where she was good enough for me to remember decades on). She carries a lot of weight just by the nature of her circumstance she has to find her husband so they can carry out their simple plan together at the stroke of midnight - not being able to find a car makes things further complicated, and Patrick makes interesting by how he reacts to her plight. He's not someone who is a super-take-charge kind of guy, but he's not about to sit in the corner with his family and give up either; he's the sort to approach everyone with some decency, even in the midst of befuddlement (i.e. being approached for sex by a male friend, in a sort of 'well, it's on my list and all' sort of rationale).At times I wasn't sure if McKellar was great for the part he wrote for himself, but at other times I don't know if anyone else could play off the awkward tension and sense of sympathy (and empathy) he carries across. He gets good work out of everyone here, most notably Cronenberg - always an underrated actor - as the man who always followed the clock and still is following it until his end (my favorite scene in the film is when he is met with a young man with a gun in his hand, who isn't sure if he can shoot him, though he may just do that, one of those moments that FEELS so real and raw).This is not to say every moment in the film entirely works, or that every attempt to be funny in its soft-cringe like manner is effective, and it actually takes a few minutes early on to gather some momentum. But there's a rhythm to it that is unique, lines like the one in the summary above that come from the heart, and there's a constant sense of 'let's try something you may not have seen before with a 'This is The End' story, down to its ambiguity around why things are ending (or for how long), and some of it comes down to it being so darn... Canadian. You may never see another apocalyptic movie with so many polite people!

Craig Zwiller (Callum Keith Rennie) has a series of women come over to his apartment.I think the movie needs to concentrate on McKellar and Oh. It would be more compelling to make this a buddy road movie. They could go to Wheeler family dinner, meet the various characters and go back to his apartment. I don't think Zwiller's story is that compelling. The other characters add some quirkiness but none of them are that compelling. It would be better to make these actors support the McKellar Oh story.

This is a quiet, uplifting, introspective investigation of our own psyches. And if anyone truly believes that humanity is going to gather together in a quiet sense of community at The End, they haven't been reading this news. While there are pockets of ideal humans living life the way they might in Northern Exposure, mob mentality rules when run by fear and adrenaline as the primary fuel for turning the page of tomorrow and find the book after page 1998 is blank. The film's core ingredient is the simple stimulation of, in witnessing a cross-section of possible life's end scenarios, the equally simple question -- What Would I Do if I knew the world was coming to an end, e.g., October 1, 2008? Not the terrorist attack on the community, but the end-sign in the cosmological equation... THAT, for me at least, is the point of the film. And very very few film productions succeed in creating that sort of personal, visceral, intimately reactive response.

Sandra is trying to get home to her husband but her car is smashed up and she finds herself stuck and finds herself on the steps of the building where Patrick lives alone. In a hotel room Craig tries to indulge as many of his sexual fantasies as he can with a black woman, a childhood teacher and others. Meanwhile Duncan at the gas company calmly phones each of his customers in turn to reassure them that they will keep the gas supply flowing right till the end.Don McKellar's directorial debut is a curious small-scale affair that has no interest in how or why the world is ending but more about how a handful of characters deal with it. Firstly I can understand why some viewers don't like it because in a way McKellar's end of the world is rather different from those seen in Hollywood films where it tends to be anything but small scale. While this film does have moments of violence and hints of the collapse of society it has much more of a curious air of just drifting to the end in a sort of bemused fashion, with most people seeking comfort rather than anarchy. The plot doesn't really have much depth but the mix of characters keeps things interesting and engaging and I found myself sort of drifting with it to the end and myself matching the slight air of comic detachment that McKellar had given it.The cast work well with this even if nobody sets the screen on fire. McKellar was a good leading man just because he obviously understands the tone he was going for and matches it well. Oh may be much more famous now than then but she is still quite convincing and I felt she worked really well with McKellar. Polley has a small role in the first of a few films where she faces the end of a world. Cronenberg is a curio but I suspect that was all he was there for. Rennie's character didn't fit in the film that well and more could have been made of his self-seeking mission &#150; he does OK but could have done more with more. The rest of the cast do well to fill out the film and provide more of an ensemble feel to it that does help cover the lack of depth or insight.Overall then a weirdly comic and engaging little film that is very much of its own style. It will frustrate some viewers for what it doesn't do while pleasing others for what it does. It could have been darker or deeper but it works well enough to provide an engaging 90 minutes.

It's never clearly stated exactly what has caused the world's condition, nor is that an important part of the story here.The main focus of the film are the characters, such as Patrick Wheeler (played by McKellar) who is a terribly lonely guy who struggles to even see his family for one last time. He wishes to end it all alone, which seems to be how he lived. Then there's his friend Craig, who is using a variety of untried sexual practices as a means to connect with someone.Isolation and loneliness are the central themes to the film. It's a recognizable representation of what the filmmaker feels would be most noticeable trait about people if all of our lives were suddenly stopped.Surprisingly, the film never becomes depressing, even as it touches on so many serious topics, including assisted suicide, but instead becomes an expression of what if and therefore is exceptionally thought-provoking.

Put people in a situation you and I will never see and watch them do things we will never do.This film is about the nature of us all and explores the breadth and depth through the surreal circumstances of a few facing the unthinkable.  As the undeniable truth of the imminent end of time presses down upon the populace, we watch some abandon the thin veneer of civility to indulge their true nature while others steadfastly adhere to their values.  The latter is explored in more detail while the former provides a backdrop of sorts against which our characters struggle.The idea of adhering to values for their own sake is explored at two levels. Briefly, the idea of vacuous ethical discipline is mocked.  One of many statements in this movie is that ethics without purpose are no better than no ethics at all and trivialize the true value of what it means to be human. Thugs and stern traditionalists are shown to have more or less the same value in the ethical spectrum simply because they are self serving rather than genuinely committed to that which is worthy.What the film spends most of it's time exploring is the struggle to maintain grace and faith in what we believe, that it is important because we want our lives to actually mean something.  Even if we cease to exist, we hope to strike a chord in the cosmos that will linger after we are gone.  Several characters seek their chord in sublime, mysterious and comical ways.  It's so sadly funny and it hurts.The final scene is one of the most deftly poetic statement of theme that I've seen in a very long time.  The end is intensely moving and it's all about the indomitable truth behind the human spirit.  We just don't know when to give up.

One passionate, silent kiss to sum up the emotion of losing everything man has fooled himself into thinking he controls and deserves makes this film a powerful statement of what is truly sacred.  Perhaps it is this premise fulfilled perfectly by this last scene that beautifully legitimizes Last Night.  The picture is at once disturbing and depressing yet inspiring, even if it reaffirms that one's actions have no effect on society.  What makes this work is the deeply personal effect that it has on the viewer;  we can not really do more than one thing at a time, and whilst everyone tries to overstimulate himself to make up for the time lost wrapped in the rush of life, the main character Patrick is disturbingly calm.  Should we not want to 'take advantage' of the last hours of everything by enjoying everything?  No, according to Patrick, whose cognizant actions, and later on everyone's actions, show just how futile the individual is.  On the same point, who needs the incomprehensible world when a bottle of wine, a good record and a kiss, albeit of death and eternity, will do?  If the world ends, it will certainly be these minutiae in life that we will miss--the things only to be enjoyed by the self or with a companion.

When you only have four hours left to live, who cares if you kill someone or have sex with your high school French teacher?What we find in Last Night is a disparate group of people, each of whom sets out to face the end in their own way. Their ways are as different as the people themselves, from Patrick's parents' insistence on pretending it's Christmas, to Sandra's suicide pact with her husband, to Craig's seemingly random, but actually carefully planned, sexual adventures.This is the real thing, kids.  No last chances, no final reprieves, no superheroes riding in to save mankind.  Just despair and the very human desire to not be alone when it all comes apart.I've seen this movie three times, and every time I watch it I see something I missed.

The film follows an assortment of characters through their final hours, quietly observing them as they spend time with loved ones, have sex, smash things up and generally find meaning for their existence in their final acts. It is a simple idea and which could so easily have been horribly naff and tearful a la Hollywood. But in the hands of Don McKellar, who wrote and directed the film as well as leading the cast, it turns into an elegant meditation on the joy of living, a celebration of human diversity and a highly moving experience.What makes Last Night such a masterpiece (albeit a very quiet one) is the telling detail. The film starts by showing the abandoned rows of shops, unattended and completely empty. The streets are filled with revellers and thugs. Sandra, a fraught Chinese-Canadian, gathers wine and other things for a final meal with her husband. As she does so, the thugs turn her car over and roll it down the street. In a world about to end, society's norms are shattered and meaning can be found in everything and nothing. This mood is at the film's heart, as human life is shown at its most vulnerable and joyous. Whether it is Patrick so desperate to spend his last night alone in memory of his dead wife, his mother pretending that it's Christmas to relive the family's happiest days or his best friend playing out each and every sexual desire before it is too late, meaning is found in a delicate mixture of truth and fantasy, fact and fiction. The performances help to keep this film utterly convincing and extremely moving. McKellar is brilliantly morose as Patrick, trying so hard to honour his love by being alone, unable to reveal the kindness that his beloved awoke in him. Sandra Oh is a study in nervous tension as she realises that her careful plan is not going to work out. I could go on about each of the others because the cast is perfect - no stars, just a classy ensemble of actors famous in Canada who work together perfectly. (Sarah Polley has of course gone on to bigger things - Doug Liman's Go -and her legs alone should guarantee her a long career as high class celluloid totty.)Last Night is such a quiet film that it could have been made in the 50s or 60s. It also contrasts charmingly with other end of the world tragedy movies like Armageddon and Deep Impact. There's no resistence here, no heroics - just the tender melancholy of humanity at its worst and best.

A woman is looking for her husband who has suddenly disappeared.  A mother clings to her young daughter, blocking out the horror that is going on around her.

Unfortunately, the execution leaves something to be desired.  The acting is almost uniformly flat (an unfortunate trait of most Canadian films, I'm afraid), and the pacing is just a bit off.  The film intertwines six or seven plotlines into a cohesive whole.  My favorite involved David Cronenberg as a gas company executive trying to keep everything running smoothly until the final hour.  My least favorite (or favorites, I should say) involved director McKellar (easily the worst actor in the film) as a self-absorbed misanthrope who hates his family & is afraid of sex.  Also included is a family pretending it's Christmas, a guy trying to fulfill every sexual fantasy he has ever had before the end, a mother & daughter sitting in a trolley with no driver, a concert pianist, and a woman running around, shouting out how much time is left.  The last three plotlines mentioned do nothing to advance the story, but merely seem there to show how arty McKellar really is.  I would have preferred that McKellar had concentrated on the other, more humanistic plotlines.This is not a bad film by any means, but given the subject matter, it could have been a little less reserved and a little more daring.

Well, that is what the characters of this wonderful, thought-provoking and basically simple Canadian film are dealing with.  From it's great opening with the Fifth Dimension's Last Night (I Couldn't Get To Sleep at Night) to the mesmerizing final five minutes with Pete Seeger's Guantanamera playing, Last Night will stay with you long after you leave the theater. This end of the world picture has none of the Hollywood treatment, that is there are no gigantic meteors hurling from space or massive volcanic eruptions destroying everything in it's path, just good old fashion dialogue with interesting ordinary people caught up in an extraordinary event. This is a well-crafted, intelligent, quirky, quiet film often humorous and sometimes poignant.While most folks have headed to the hills, some destroying the city and others just hanging out, Patrick (Don McKellar) just wants to spend his last few hours by himself relaxing in his apartment. But first he has to endure a Christmas dinner (even though it's not Christmas) with his immediate family. After leaving, his plans of a quiet uneventful last night do not quite turn out as he expected.  Sandra (Sandra Oh) picking up a few things at an abandoned supermarket and finding that her car has been the victim of some folks just letting off steam, wants to get back to her husband then finish off the evening with a double suicide.  Patrick's buddy, Craig (Callum Keith Rennie) has been going through all types of sexual escapades for the last two months and wants to go out in style by finishing off with a black hooker, his high school French teacher (the once beautiful, but looking somewhat haggard Genevieve Bujold) and a virgin. All of this takes place while the city's radio station is counting down the top 500 songs of all time, including many K-Tel gems like the DiFranco Family's Heartbeat, It's a Lovebeat and Edward Beer's Last Song.Last Night starts out pretty much benign with everyone going through the motions as if the end of the world is not that big of a deal, but as the hours dwindle, a sense of urgency is slightly felt, although not to the point that makes the film downbeat or maudlin. The film is filled with plenty of humor and some sly wit, especially about cell phones and the progression of the automobile; as one character puts it the design of the car pretty much peaked in the 70's, 1972 to be exact.  The writing is smart and writer, director and star Don McKellar knows that there is no need to push to extremes, he keeps it simple as it should be.  Isn't the end of the world the greatest extreme to begin with, no need to add to it. His characters are all well developed and real, including the smaller roles. McKellar knows how to write for actors and being an actor himself that should come as no surprise. The majority of actors are unknown, at least here in the states and that is very refreshing.  But refreshing does not cut it if the acting is mediocre or bad, but all involved do excellent work with simple, understated performances. Each actor captures the heart and soul of their characters without pushing or giving in to sentimentality. McKellar and Oh turn in some impressive performances, but Rennie, Bujold and Cronenberg also do good work,Yes the film makes you wonder how you would spend the last 6 hours, but it goes deeper than that by having you examine your life regardless of the time and figuring out what is important and what is not in regards to your own happiness.  The world is not going to end in the near or distant future, but eventually our own personal worlds will, whether it be next month, next year, 10 years or 50 years from now.  This totally entertaining and thought-provoking film is a great wake-up call to put things in perspective. I just thoroughly loved it. By all means add this film to the top of your must see list, it is one of this years best. Highly Recommended.

Last Night is a smart, sweet film about people facing the fictitious end of the world.  It is told from the vantage point of the last six hours on earth for several different people - a dysfunctional family whose only son wants to witness the end by himself, a woman separated from her husband and left to decide if she will carry out their mutual agreement, a sex addict who appetite knows no time limit, a gas company executive and his trustworthy secretary who try to carry on as usual, and a lonely French teacher whose students are her only comfort.  Writer, director, and star Don McKellar has fashioned a well-acted film with dialogue which is both comical and yet poignant.  Sandra has her car (could it be an AMC Gremlin?) totally dismantled by a punk mob and left standing on its end and she sobs that 'someone has killed her car'.  Later she tells Patrick as time is running out to 'tell me something to make me love you'. Again Sandra, deciding whether to witness the final cataclysmic event, says to Patrick,   'I 'd much rather it came from you'. Craig, with his hand-scribbled listing on his kitchen wall of sexual adventures he needs to accomplish, tells Patrick he would like mutual orgasm to which Patrick says, 'I must be leaving'.  At the dinner table, with turkey and lamb and all the feasting,  Patrick's mother cries her heart out with a steady, low shrill as daughter Jennifer pretends nothing is wrong and says 'let's get started'.  Finally, Craig and his final consort, the gas company executive's secretary, come together and she tells him 'it's time to get to work'.  Few films can dramatize how it would be like, on a gut level, when the end is near.  On The Beach is one example.  Last Night has that same mesmerizing quality of closeness and compassion.  Kudos for this splendid Canadian film and all the fine performances, starting with McKellar, Sandra Oh, Genevieve Bujold, David Cronenberg (of all people) and Callum Keith Renne.

McKellar is wry and sad as Patrick Wheeler, a man determined to spend the last hour or so of his life alone; Sandra Oh, as a woman trying to return home to her husband, is energetic and heartbreaking; and Callum Keith Renne really shines as an old buddy of Patrick's trying to complete a lofty project before life's end.Thankfully, Last Night's redemption (before the end of the world, of course) is that McKellar puts away the trite six degrees game half-way through his tale, and completes a touching, human movie about people's final choices (or lack thereof).  The final 15 minutes is a wonderful combination of freakiness and emotion, with the sincerity and motives of the sometimes-bland characters finally realized. In all, a vote of a '7', as it seems that this movie will get better with repeated viewings.

We are always trying to make ourselves known to our southern neighbours.  We get upset when they don't know the Canadian national anthem or when they don't know what the capital of Saskatchewan is. And it is this inferiority compex that I believe is at the root of people in this forum that praise this movie like it was the best film ever made. When a lot of Canadians say how wonderful it is, they don't forget to mention the other films that came out last year that were end of the world films. And they say how terrible those films were, how hollow they were, how they were more concerned with the bottom line than to make a meaningful movie that had something to say.  Last Night, paranoid Canadians say, is a film that is so good because there is no special effects and it concentrates on humanity and not the anamoly that is headed towards Earth.  Well let me ask you this.  When did entertainment ever become an evil forum?  When is that films like Armageddon and Deep Impact became the enemy.  And when is it that films were ever made because someone didn't want to turn in a profit?  Do you think there is ever a time when someone says  You know what?  I don't want this film to make any money.  I just want to invest my life savings into this film and have three or four people enjoy it and then I want the guys who financed this to go broke. Folks, movies are a business and that is why Hollywood is as strong as it is and that is why the Canadian film industry is in the shape and state that it is in.  We may tell stories that are interesting and have a point, but ya know what?  They are boring. Most Canadian films are boring.  Armageddon and Deep Impact were fun and entertaining and they followed a formula sure, but when you sat down in the theaters last year and you were in the cool air conditioned theater and you heard Charleton Heston's voice over explaining that  it happened once, it will happen again, it is just a matter of time, didn't you just sit back and say to yourself,  this is going to be fun.   And if you answer no to that question, you are either lying or didn't want to like that film going into it.  It was an exciting film and most of our products are boring. Now I am not saying that's how I felt about Last Night, because I didn't.  But I certainly don't feel that this is the be all to end all to film that most others do.  It is a good film but it is hollow.  And it is so typically Canadian.  When people say that this film was good because there were no special effects and blah blah blah, that is because they can't afford them. And yes that forces people to write a script that is more concerned with how people talk and how they feel and on that level Last Night is fine, it is not great, it is just fine.  It didn't move me and frankly I didn't really think it had much to say.  It was just all right.What I did enjoy was the exploration into some people's lives.  Some were interesting and some were not.  I found the sex addict to be amusing and actually quite real.  His life was devoted to having as much sex as possible before he went out.  And that was interesting.  The guy who wanted to perform his first concert on the night of the end of the world was good as well.  But tell me please, what would anyone be doing at work on this day? And a gas company?  Come on.  That just didn't do it for me.  And why did Cronenburg's character get shot?  For something to do?  For kicks?  Was that the reason?  It just wasn't clear.  You see, to me, if you want to have a film that examines the psychology of humans on the last night of the earth, then you have to have a few characters that are richer than this.  I didn't buy the whole story with Patrick and the Oriental girl.  It felt forced and it's like the script was grasping when it wrote that story line in.  So I guess my problem with the story is that it didn't show enough of what it really would be like.  And it was so damn slow in some areas.  I know it sounds like I really hated this movie, but that is not the case, I am giving it a 7 out of ten, but it is just not the master piece that I think everyone says it is.  Of course that is just my humble opinion and I am obviously in the minority here.  Perhaps I am a product of Hollywood so it clouds my judgement, but there are small films that I can enjoy just as much as the next person, but they have to be from the heart, I didn't feel that in here. It felt close, but in a way, I could feel the paranoia.  And I am Canadian as well, born in Montreal, raised in Windsor and London Ont. and spent a few years in T.O.  So I am as proud a Canadian as they come. And like I said, it is a good film, but ask yourself this, if this was a film done by a smaller American director, perhaps Alan Parker or even someone like John Badham, would you as Canadians think it was as great as you say it is?  Or would you just say,  Yep, not bad, interesting.  And then move on and look forward to the next Will Smith movie to come out?Think about it.

The story takes place in Toronto on new years eve 1999 and tells us about how the characters spend the final six hours of existence and about their relations with each other. Hence it relies on the excellent story instead of a massive Hollywood budget and zillion dollar effects. Of course I liked the scene in Deep Impact where Paris is destroyed, or the white house in Independence Day but that's maybe 20 seconds of the film.

"},{"Title":"The Humanity of Last Night","Date":"30 March 1999","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  Last Night is a superb directorial debut from Don McKellar. He has been around since 1989 in the Canadian film world, with writing credits for films such as Roadkill and Highway 61, and acting appearances in numerous films including Atom Egoyan's The Adjuster and Exotica. At the Cannes film festival, McKellar won an award for best film by a first-time director, an achievement that he shares with other great directors such as Martin Scorsese.Last Night builds is narrative around a complex set of character relationships. At the center of all the relationships is Patrick (McKellar) and everyone else that he knows or encounters is connected to him in a very logical pattern. This gives us the impression that we are all connected at a distance, but that these relationships are tenuous.This film is a perfect example of how Canadian film deals with issues differently than American film. Last Night can easily be compared to both Armageddon and Deep Impact, both of which are American versions of what would occur if the world was stricken with impending doom, an apocalyptic end to our world. Last Night is a film that cares more about people, not the 'monster' that will put the end to our existence. We are not even aware of what it is that's bringing the world to an end. In both Armageddon and Deep Impact, we know right off that asteroids are on a path to collide with earth, and this is the real focus of attention in both films, even though Deep Impact tries to develop a human story. The American notion seems to be that we can stop anything with technology and a few nuclear bombs. There is always a hero or group of heroes that are sent on a mission to save the day. And of course they do, and we're supposed to feel all happy and warm inside. The Canadian view appears to be more pessimistic on the surface; there is absolutely no efforts being performed to stop the 'monster' (there is no point because it is unstoppable, so me may as well just accept it), but it is clear at the end of Last Night that 'love' prevails, which in itself is quite optimistic.In Deep Impact, it is quite obvious that the family unit is important, as it is in Last Night, but the message in Deep Impact seems to be that one must connect with their family or at least someone at the end, even if it means connecting with your father on a beach just before a thousand foot wave crashes by. Last Night allows that some individuals may want to spend time alone right up until the end. This doesn't mean that everyone is alone at the end; even Patrick who wants to spend his last hours in his apartment by himself, meets Sandra (Sandy Oh) who is desperately trying to get home to her husband, Duncan (David Cronenberg), but cannot, and spends it with her. She is the kind of person who needs to be with someone, and she needs to know that someone loves her, and has to be with that person. Without giving too much away about the relationship between Sandra and Patrick, it is interesting to see how their relationship unfolds in the critical moments.Another character in the film appears to want to be alone at least from his family and friends. Ever since he learned of the end, he has pursuing every sexual fantasy conceivable. He has a shrine in his kitchen dedicated to his sexual fantasies. This is his way of dealing with end. In a sense, at the end he is not alone, but to the contrary he is connected to another person in the most intimate way possible with a virgin who answered to his web-page.Thankfully, there is minimal footage of riots in the streets of Toronto. Some of this occurs, but it by no means is dominant, as I suspect it would have been in an American picture. There seems to be a stereotype that people would go crazy and riot if they were confronted with such a situation, but this is not necessarily true. Its definitely not true in Last Night. This is all the more reason to remain civil, it's a test, says Patrick's father, when the family gets together to celebrate Christmas.Overall, I feel that Last Night succeeds in illustrating how different human beings may react differently to hearing that the world is coming to an end. It is true, everyone would act different and this film says nothing of a morally correct way or acceptable way to behave. After all, why should it? As one character states, you may as well experience those things that you have always wanted to, while you can. It is not saying that all people will act in this fashion, but that some people will, others will spend the time by themselves, and yet others will strengthen as a family unit.

Last Night gives one a chance to imagine how *you* might act would you abandon civilization for a party to the end? Would you hold on to your faith and pray to the end? Would you keep going to work because you simply nothing else to do? Would you take your life or someone elses, simply because you can?The film also is unabashedly Canadian - recognizable Canadian actors (Sandra Oh, Geneviève Bujold, etc), places (it is set in Toronto, Yonge St., etc) and references are a pleasant change, and will certainly add to the surrealism of Canadian viewers. It is a small, very professional production.

My main problem is with the main character - played by writer/director Don McKellar - who takes up a large chunk of the screen time but is far less interesting than most of the secondary characters (this is not because of McKellar's acting but mainly because the character is probably an avatar for McKellar himself and therefore far less extreme). This, couple with acting that is sometimes great but often wooden and lacking in emotion (a strange trait of many Canadian independent films) makes the film less effective emotionally than it should have been, and keeps it in the category of though-provoking allegory and intellectual exercise. As such, it's a wonderful little film and a very unusual one.

He had caught it on Television on one night and it took me some time but I tracked it down because I do enjoy post-apocalyptic films and rarely see anything Canadian that stands out in my opinion but I was absolutely pleasantly surprised by this Canadian gem. It doesn't make itself explicitly clear that its Canadian but it doesn't need to because that's not what its about. The film is about a group of people preparing for the end of the world. Its moving, its well acted, and it has a terrific pace. It leaves you with an endless amount of questions but it has to because that's the nature of the film.Don McKellar leads the cast, not only as the star but also directs and wrote the film and does a terrific award worthy job as quiet and strong Patrick Wheeler. The film follows him for the most part almost exclusively throughout different circumstances and you become attached to his character. Sandra Oh is fantastic as Sandra. She has a lot of emotion and strength and her and McKellar have great chemistry opposite each other. The film really does focus on the two of them and it carries the film throughout but it would be a crime to not mention the supporting cast who are all excellent in their small roles. Sarah Polley, David Cronenberg, Roberta Maxwell, and Robin Gammell stand out in great small roles in the film. Also Callum Keith Rennie gives a really great performance as the best friend to McKellar who spends his last hours trying to fulfill his every sexual wish.The film is light on special effects because the story is about how this group of people are each handling the inevitable end of the world. You will wonder throughout the film whether this is actually going to happen, and you will wonder what caused this apocalypse but ultimately none of that matters because you are watching how each of those people deal with the end of the world. It is unique in the fact that it isn't about the event that is happening but rather the people involved. It is riveting, heart wrenching, captivating and truly worth seeing!!

Our main character, Patrick Wheeler is caught between fulfilling his parents plans and his own.I don't want to give too much of this simple, beautiful and heartfelt movie away, but I think it boils down to a question of opening ourselves up - to be less alone - and to let love in.

It is six when the film starts, and the world will end at midnight. No, we never find out what is happening, what will cause the world to end. And no, Bruce Willis is not going to stop it. Mankind, perhaps the entire Earth, is doomed, and we are told from the outset that there is no chance for an alternative outcome. Don't even dare to expect it.

It's not just the different take, the character driven end and lack of Hollywood glitz, but it really lacks a spark somewhere and though I did enjoy it, much of it was like my take of a rainy day when one cannot seem to get off the couch.For the viewer who didn't understand the AMC Pacer, perhaps I missed it, in not seeing any newer cars, but it seemed to take place in that era. For tedg, I for once agree in that there was not energy here for me save for anti-energy.I must admit I was very tired when I watched this, falling asleep toward the end so I had to actually sit up from my reclined position, and maybe I will have to give it a second look (my sleep was just one of those head jerks though). I just don't see it as genius, more than a boring different take on a sometimes popular theme. While Armageddon certainly did not deserve a Criterion collection entry, there exist never a chance for this work, I should think.**SPOILER** Oh, while I'm ranting, we should all realize why it is light at midnight, but unless it is between two converging stars, it is still dark on the other side of the planet unless light has shown some bend. ...and one last area before I shut my pie hole, I also have to agree with the dissenters who note that the characters are hardly fleshed out. I really did not care if any of them died at the end save for Sarah Polley 'cause she's just so attractive (yes, I know, how shallow of me, but oh well). I really am deeper than that though this movie is not.I'll leave it at this since my fellow dissenters have their share of solid arguments already posted here...

Planets rotate because of something called the conservation of angular momentum. The moon rotates too, but at just the right speed so that it always keeps one face pointed toward the Earth. It's not a coincidence. Almost all moons in the Solar System keep one face pointed toward their planet, because of a process called tidal friction. Could Earth suddenly slow it's spin so that one side is always aimed at the sun and survive? No. Not so long as the Moon is there. If you could somehow get rid of the Moon and wait long enough (a few hundred thousand years), Earth would eventually always face the sun. All other scenarios would destroy the earth instantly.Our Sun will not go supernova in a huge explosion, it's not massive enough. Instead, when it's fuel is exhausted it will grow into a Red Giant then to Planetary Nebula to White Dwarf to Black Dwarf. And we'll have a lot more warning than a few months! In fact we know right now when it's going to happen; In 5 billion years! Then the earth will begin to warm as the Sun begins to grow. Over a period of thousands of years the Earth will be swallowed up and destroyed by the Red Giant Sun. So we have to conclude that the scenario presented in this movie has absolutely no basis in science fact. But beware; it's still a pretty good movie. I knew all of this going in, but I still managed to enjoy it.

If a sun is about to go supernova the sky will be bright at midnight. The sun's explosion is basically racing towards the earth and everything in it's path incinerated or evaporated. The blinding white at the movies' end silent and final...It's over! as one soul cries out almost joyfully in the final moving moments. I watched the movie six times over the weekend and found myself charmed, saddened and perhaps encouraged by the sense of nobility found within each of the characters. While there are meaningless and random acts that are violent. The earth's very death ensured in a cataclysmic fireball, the majority of interactions we watch are gentle, thoughtful. There is a kindness offered. Even in the character wanting nothing more than a succession of sexual partners, we see a genuine love and affection being shared. The movie offers cerebral. Like one other reader here, I too would watch this movie during my last hours as well.

It's the end of the world, and everyone has chosen how they want to spend the final few hours. Many converge on public places to say farewell together. Some want to spend it with their families. One man wants to spend it having sex in all the ways he's yet to experience. And one man wants to commit suicide on a rooftop. Featuring the best use of the song Guantanamera yet commited to film.

Intriguing film? Sorry. The directorial debut of ubiquitous Canadian actor-writer Don McKellar, Last Night suffers from an excess of characters and too little time to develop them all.It's not that the characters aren't promising. Craig (Callum Keith Rennie), having carefully complied a list of his favorite sexual fantasies, turns his last hours into a coital odyssey which includes his high school French teacher (Genevieve Bujold).To reach her husband for a final rendezvous, Sandra (Sandra Oh) must brave street hooligans and the traffic jam (literally) to end all traffic jams.Her husband (David Cronenberg), manager of the local gas company, spends the last day of his life calling all his customers thanking them for their custom and promising to keep the gas flowing until the very end. His adoring assistant (Tracy Wright) confesses to him that she has been sneaking a tipple out of her desk-drawer flask every day at six o'clock. I could fire you for that, her boss winks.McKellar, who also wrote the script, plays a nerdy junior architect who's elected to spend his last moments by himself in his apartment with a good Chianti and Pete Seeger on the CD player. Like Garbo, he chust vants to be alone. However, one by one, the other players threaten to rob him of his final wish in various ways.It's not bad on paper. The problem is, unless you're Robert Altman, six hours (compressed into an hour and a half running time) is nowhere near long enough to flesh out an ensemble cast so the audience genuinely cares about each of them. Watching this film is like flipping through an album of still photographs.Nobody grows, learns anything or even does anything interesting. Maybe that's the point of the movie faced with the End Of The World As They Know It, people remain as dull as ever. If it is, it's not much of a point.Contrast this with Stanley Kramer's classic On The Beach. In this film, just like in Last Night, a group of characters waits helplessly for the Final Curtain. The difference is, in On The Beach, they're real people, and you're sorry to see them go.
