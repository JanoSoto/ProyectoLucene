[{"Title":"One of the great world-movies","Date":"25 March 2003","Score":"67 out of 81 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  In the early 90's Jarmusch delivered this charmer, a movie that unites America and Europe through one single topic, yet shows very different versions of it.At probably the exact same moment people around the globe get into taxis. A stylish Hollywood casting agent mounts a cab in L.A., in New York it's a hapless poor man trying to get home, in Paris we encounter a blind woman, in Rome a priest and in Helsinki a bunch of drunks will tell their story. Yes, indeed. Stories are told, because each episode is an encounter with the respective cabbie, who all have a life and a past of their own.Wynona Ryder's performance of the 20-year-old, chain-smoking taxi driver does not work very well and also makes for the least interesting story. But Armin MÃ¼ller-Stahl as an East-German refugee and former clown, who is awe-struck and belittled by the bustling NYC around him makes up for a lot. His helplessness when trying to communicate with his passenger, played by Giancarlo Esposito, almost becomes tangible when it manifests in his complete inability to steer the taxi. Within very few minutes the two men develop an utterly deep and good-humored trust and friendship between them. I'd call it the funniest portion of the movie, but in Rome we encounter Roberto Benigni as an always talking, sex-obsessed cabbie. His is the story we get the least emotional or intellectual outcome from, but, hey, welcome to the Benigni Show! If you are open-minded enough to laugh about a few surprises in the field of sexual experimentation (which we don't see but only hear described without too much detail), this one will stay with you as one of the brightest twenty minutes in your life. Before Rome we visit Paris with the most mysterious, yet most catching segment, a curious story about the afore-mentioned blind woman and a black cab driver, who - we can't be sure - might be going blind himself (he's very short-sighted and therefore has problems with driving his taxi) and has a lot of questions to ask. The woman, however, is not interested in conversation, yet we get the impression she opens up more than the driver realizes. In Helsinki a group of drunks tell the story of their sleeping friend's worst day. The cab-driver listens to it. It's a terrible story about a horrible predicament and the poor fellow's life basically lies in ruins. And yet the cabbie tops the story with one of the saddest things you'll ever have heard.The concept of the movie thinks of night as a place rather than a time, because all of the stories begin at the same moment in time but in different time zones. We move east in the process of the film and so we experience sunset in Los Angeles and early morning in Helsinki. Each of these times lends a special atmosphere to the story it tells, which becomes the most effective in the Helsinki story, which is utterly sad, however ends with a new day starting. People leave their places and go about their lives - the world moves on, none of the stories has an ending, life for each of the characters (except one) will continue.What's so great about this movie is that it tells such different stories with such different characters who all have different pasts and intentions, each accommodating the place of action (even visually - in L.A. even the buildings appear to be candy-flavored, while in Helsinki the city is cold, drab, yet hopeful) and it all comes together to this huge picture, which reminds us that we are all different but all live on the same planet and know similar things about life, death and everything in-between. I wonder what this movie would have been like, if Jarmusch had also considered taxis in non-western countries.I highly recommend this movie to anyone who... Oh, blast! I recommend this movie to everyone.

Another in his several episodic-style films, this time he pushes forward his great use of pure conversational, and emotional, comedy, as well as drama. In fact, this may be one of the best from the 90's of that kind that came out (i.e. mixing comedy and drama to create some bittersweet vignettes). Inspiration of course pours out from European cinema, but even in the American segments there's a sense of genuine pathos with the characters. Sometimes one style was kept totally consistent, with all comedy in episode four or all tragedy in episode five, or the two styles went back and forth like in the first two. The third remains the more ambiguous, and maybe more uncomfortable, segment of the bunch, and even if it might be the lesser of them all it's still fascinating due to the actors.But to get back to the humanism that comes on in the film, it's not something at all uncommon to Jarmusch's work. In Ghost Dog it goes a long way to help us not be too left out of the world of Whitaker's character, or it makes every lady seem all the more odd and unique in Broken Flowers. Here since it is met with a more realistic approach, with situations that could be happening right now at night in these cities, I'm almost reminded of Renoir. Particularly in the second segment in New York, where there's the perfect divide between lightness and over-the-top- lightness being in Armin Mueller-Stahl's performance as Helmut (German ex-clown turned un-knowing cabbie) and Giancarlo Esposito's performance as Yo-yo. Maybe it's because scenes like these usually wouldn't make it into 'mainstream' fare, but a sequence like this showcases some great dialog on both sides (and when Rosie Perez comes in, all bets are off). Stahl especially makes the scenes work in-particular as he almost seems to inhabit this person of an outsider in the (taken for granted) amazing space of NYC.To say which one was my overall favorite might be a little picky, as every one of them had something to offer differently. There was the cute, and slightly awkward, scenes with Ryder and Rowlands (maybe one of Ryder's few gems in her career too, mostly based on style). The segment in Paris, again, may make one feel a little uncomfortable, but that might be the point. And I loved how Beatrice Dalle's role went effortlessly between the bizarre and the almost ironically compassionate. It's also the segment which provides a little extra bitter of a touch by way of the Ivory Coast cabbie, however it does come to pass as being about two outsiders thrust into a strange little moment in life. Roberto Benigni's segment was drop dead funny, which is surprising considering the hit or miss ways of Jarmusch's comedy. But Benigni is so outrageous in his long monologue its no wonder what becomes of his passenger. It's a terrific mix between Benigni's voracious style of fast (but not too fast) speech, and a sort of silent-film kind of comedy, likely out of Buster Keaton or something. And all of this is accentuated by a carefully controlled mis en scene of driving (which is always visually endearing), where right when you're expecting there to be a cut it waits one or two extra seconds. It's a film with a sweet rhythm that doesn't drag like in Jarmusch at his worst.The last segment, oddly enough, could be a downer for some. It was for me, until I decided to watch it a second time. This combines the frustration seen in bits in the other segments regarding a city life that bogs down on its inhabitants, and the sympathy that can come out even behind the tough veneer of lives lived with a shell protecting them from idiots. When it comes time for Matti Pellonpaa's monologue, it makes for the most touching, and a close-call for most emotionally striking, thing Jarmusch has ever written, put together by his portrayal. What's interesting even more so is how the film, despite this bleak story, doesn't seem to end too much on that note, due to the last little bit between Mika and Avi, the drunk passenger. In fact, after watching this a second time, I got to get the sense of what the film might be about- getting past that separation between a driver doing his job and a passenger with their own issues. It's also a small ruby of a communication fable, of how lives in different cities and countries may be of course different in speech and attitude and dress, but have similar plights to deal with in the dead of night.

The film is actually 5 short films of around twenty minutes, each one a taxi journey, taking place at the exact same moment in 5 cities across the world, from LA to Helsinki, via New York, Paris and Rome.Without ruining the surprises contained (its unexpectedness is one of its delights) the film covers numerous emotions. At times it is utterly hilarious, at others it's sad and moving. It is pacy and yet considered, the characters are well painted, both by the writing and the acting, and the story lines engrossing yet punchy. There are some sub-titles, by the way, but please don't let that put you off.

This probably comes from thinking of the entire movie as belonging to a single genre--drama, comedy, satire. If you take each story by itself, though, with an open mind, you will find yourself being entertained (mostly) in five different ways. Although of course we will all have our favorites. I wondered briefly why there wasn't a segment set in Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan--to make it truly global. Of course it wouldn't be night at the same time on that side of the world. Jarmusch should have done it anyway.Some think the movie is too long.

The first of five segments (in L.A.) deals with Winona Ryder (in a broad, self-conscious performance) as a cab driver who picks up Gena Rowlands, who wants to put her in a movie. Rowlands is subtle and complex she's a rich bitch with a soft side, but we don't know if she's the former because she's a player or if she's the latter because she wants to use Ryder. What Jarmusch is going for is to contrast the social classes -- he has an obvious, unfunny line where Ryder's character says she's never been to the executive terminal at the airport before -- but what's really interesting is seeing, since Jarmusch is usually a male-oriented director, how he handles women (one a tomboy, one in a position of power).It's obvious that the little idea of a movie about four taxi cab drivers is just a thin story that gives Jarmusch an excuse to work with certain actors, like Rowlands, whose late, great husband he adores. He goes for cultural miscommunication in the New York story (which is the film's most tender and brotherly), the warring cultures within a city, where a black man (Giancarlo Esposito) who can't land a cab fights with his Puerto Rican girlfriend while being badly driven around by former circus clown (Armin Mueller-Stahl, in a goofy, charming performance). Jarmusch makes brilliant statements on race and color in the Paris segment, with a sassy blind woman who's aware of what her driver is thinking of her -- and who turns our expectations on their head twice, without coming back to where we started. Benigni, who doesn't play the clown, is nevertheless the funniest in the Rome ride he talks aloud to himself and outdoes and predates American Pie by almost a decade. The final, Helsinki section is the most powerful. When the cabbie tries to one-up the sob story by one of his three passengers, the conclusion seems to be that he wins; the two conscious passengers seem to think their unconscious friend's troubles are insignificant, as if they can't both be sad. 7/10 "}{"Title":"The best film of Jim Jarmusch","Date":"6 March 2007","Score":"8 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" For me this film is the best of Jarmusch and one of my favorites films ever.

It has five different stories, each on a different city, with very different people, but all in a taxi. All the people are very different, with different background, ambitions, culture and personality, but in the end, so similar. I loved every part of it, some of them are very funny, others touching, depressing, heartbreaking, enjoyable or simply beautiful. They are all wonderful portraits of the city in which they happen. They don't show touristic locations, but how the cities really are and how people behave and think. Every story is well told, with great pace, amazing, believable dialogs and realistic characters that you get to know very well in little time. They work both together and alone. They're all great and I can't choose my favorite.In the first segment, a young tomboy taxi driver meets a wealthy talent seeker, who wants to cast her in a movie. In New York, an afro American meets an immigrant, his cab driver, lost in the city. In Paris, a blind girl takes a ride with an irritable cab driver from the Ivory Coast and they talk about life and blindness. In Rome, a cab driver picks up a priest and starts confessing, and in Helsinki a miserable driver picks up three drunks and they speak about the most depressing things that ever happened to them.The direction is amazing in all its simplicity. The camera angles are steady, usually focusing no the actors and allowing you to concentrate on the dialogs.But there are some that show the city, the cars passing, the buildings, lovers in the middle of the night, junkies, etc, and these have unusual quality.The acting is great by everyone. Winona Ryder, frequently criticized, is in my opinion very funny and totally different from her other roles. I really enjoyed her acting. Gena Rowlands plays her opposite in a nice, underacting way. Armin Mueller-Stahl is very touching and expressive (the moment he says he was a clown is very beautiful), with an amazing use of his eyes. Giancarlo Esposito and Jennifer Perez are fun to watch, too. BÃ©atrice Dalle is incredibly charismatic and believable as a blind young woman, and Isaach De BankolÃ© is good. Roberto Benigni is about as hilarious as you can get, in his one man show. His speech is obviously very funny, but Benigni makes it mind blowing. Some will hate it, though I couldn't stop laughing. Matti PellonpÃ¤Ã¤ delivers his speech in a dramatic, depressive way but without overacting.The cinematography and the music are beautiful, make this movie feel nostalgic and help linking the segments.

Roberto Benigni is excellent as the offbeat cab driver who likes the company of pumpkins and sheep, and his funny segment is juxtaposed quite beautifully with the more heartfelt and raw finale. My favourite segment, however, is the equally funny New York section starring Giancarlo Esposito, which is basically a culture clash between a working-class New Yorker and a foreign immigrant's first night driving a taxi. It balances both the humour and drama perfectly, a harmony which isn't met so successfully in the rest of the film. Yet, Jim Jarmusch's tale about disparate lives intermingling during one night is both original, bold (filming across the world and in native languages has to be applauded), poignant, and very funny.

These summer nights seem to beg me to stay up until the earliest hours of the morning, and it's hard not to comply &#x97; at two pm, there's nothing in the world stopping a friend from asking you for a favor, a grandma inviting you to move furniture for an estate sale, a parent demanding you mow both lawns, take out the garbage, and clean your bathroom. But at two am, every one of those people is asleep nobody expects anything from you, and, for once, the stresses of reality cease because no one else is throwing them in your face. Nighttime is a period of spooky solitude, elusively appealing.Night on Earth divides itself into five vignettes, all set during these wee hours, all involving the relationship between a taxi driver and their temporary client, all in a different city. Directed by Jim Jarmusch, one might expect a deadpan drama of steeping revelations and scintillating conversations, in the way Broken Flowers could make even the most awkward of an exchange blossom with black hilarity. But Night on Earth is wildly uneven, some of the segments mostly involving, others splendidly acted but unsuccessful in their rendering. I've always felt that a movie comprised of short films should be so arresting in each segment that it wouldn't be unheard of to pine for a longer, feature adaptation. But even in its best moments, Night on Earth is slight, some performers more pleasing than others &#x97; a difficulty when some segments are damaged by particular characters.The first vignette, set in Los Angeles, stars Winona Ryder as the cab driver, Corky, Gena Rowlands as the passenger, Victoria. Corky, young and spunky, chain smokes, chews bubblegum, and figures that her dream career is that of a mechanic; Victoria, middle-aged, welcoming, and refined, is a casting agent looking for fresh talent. She sees a spark in Corky, figuring her rough-and-tumble attitude could be assembled into a rebellious, cool product headed toward stardom. This segment, though dampened by Ryder's unconvincing portrayal of a grungy youth with small dreams, makes an impression thanks to the always lovely Rowlands, who makes what could be an unlikable character affectionate, motherly even.The second, stationed in New York and headed by Armin Mueller-Stahl, Giancarlo Esposito, and Rosie Perez, is the second most annoying of the segments driver Stahl, a German immigrant, hardly knows how to drive, so his customer Esposito takes over the wheel and loudmouths his way through awkward silences. Midway through the trip, the two pick up the shrill Perez, who happens to be Esposito's sister-in-law. The vignette could be enjoyable, with Stahl sweetening the atmosphere as a gentle giant, but Esposito and Perez are so obnoxious that we can hardly wait for the short to be over.The third sequence travels to Paris, by far working as the most straightforward, best written moment in the film. Here, a blind woman (BÃ©atrice Dalle) gets a ride from an endlessly p-ssed off driver (Isaach De BankolÃ©) who rethinks his usual grumpiness after she gives him a run for his money the woman, it seems, is scorned by life and completely disregards her ailment, scoffing whenever her cabbie asks an inappropriately curious question. The segment works so well because of the rapport between Dalle and BankolÃ© &#x97; whereas the other shorts attempt to have the characters find a mutual understanding between each other, Dalle and BankolÃ©'s mutual curiosity/disdain bears an odd sexual tension, fascinating just enough to leave us potentially wanting more but backing off when considering just how well it works.I won't go far into the fourth sequence (set in Rome), which is jaw-droppingly irritating as comedian Roberto Benigni delivers a mile-a-minute performance as a cab driver who just won't shut up. If he's annoying to his guest then he's annoying to us as well &#x97; don't expect to want to do anything besides fast-forward as his mouth runs into oblivion, us preferring deafness to hearing any more about another one of his sexual experiences. Following the exasperation of this vignette, Night on Earth ends on a melancholy note as it hits the snowy streets of Helsinski, with a group of passengers complaining about how horrible their friend's day was until the driver decides to top it with a soul crushing experience himself. While I appreciate Jim Jarmusch's enviable ability to turn realism into sardonic astuteness, Night on Earth feels more like a filmmaking exercise than an actual film. It doesn't move &#x97; it serves as an experiment pleasing only the people involved while the audience sits and waits patiently for something moving to happen.

I'll agree with most that the 1st episode (LA) is also the weakest. But good performances by Rowlands and Ryder still manages to bring it home nicely. Then we move to NY for a warm, touching and low key funny episode with a great performance by Stahl. Now off to Paris for a weird, but strangely fascinating interaction between a Black driver and a blind girl. This is an episode that grows on you the more times you see it. Now for some good fun. Welcome to the Benigni show in Rome. Now this may be the least authentic part, but it's downright hilarious. After having had your spirits lifted here we move on to Cold, gloomy Helsinki for the final part that could very well bring out the tears. It does however end with a light twist to get you out without feeling too miserable. This is my favorite Jarmush movie.

Otherwise, we were simply fooled by the original Jarmusch (well, maybe we were a little), as we lived the experience of five different shorts in the same movie, presented as one whole piece. The truth is I don't know what was the man's plan, so these are guesses. However, whatever the plan there's no doubt that Night on Earth is a good piece of film-making. Honest also, the film doesn't ask much of the viewer; only that he or she listens and watches carefully. If you do that, you will be rewarded. But don't worry about trying to get some 'meaning of life' thing out of this ride; the less you look for the better, because although Jarmusch's script is as complex and thought provoking as they come, there's never an intention of teaching something or giving a lesson of anything. The development is simple, as stated in the adequate tagline Five Taxis, Five Cities, One Night. What's a night on Earth, anyway? Well, for me it's just about every single night of my life, and I suppose it's the same for Matsan who lives with me and for my parents and brothers for that matter. Well, Jarmusch chose the cities and the characters taxi drivers. I mention the characters in detail and not the cities because I personally believe that these five cities could have been any of the cities of the world (of the Earth, to respect the film's title). The fact that the cities Jarmusch chose are iconic world places and that the director 'knows the night' of every one of them and shoots them brilliantly and similarly and trying to tour them all is a remarkable fact, but still I don't feel the necessity of mentioning the cities in this review. As I said, I'd like to make a reference to the taxi drivers the first one, played splendidly by Winona Ryder is a compulsive smoker who looks and acts like a boy and cares about nothing else than her work and becoming a mechanic; the second one, played by a phenomenal Almin Mueller Stahl, is a man who is apparently driving a car for the first time; the others include Roberto Benigni (and I think with that you can imagine the character), a black driver played by Isaach De BankolÃ© and a driver named Mika played by Matti Pellonpaa. All of these individuals 'are' the film, which shows each taxi from a few camera angles and cares about anything else than the people in each car (the ones who are not driving also give magnificent portrayals) and the streets of each city. I realize that I might not be writing a very enthusiastic review, but I think it may not be enough with the expressions 'amazing script' and 'amazing human perception' to convince to watch this atypical picture. I'm going to take one last risk by telling you that what you'll see must happen every day in many cities of the Earth. But to write it down and shoot it for people to watch it, laugh at or with it and maybe also cry, is very original and unforgettable. Of course, if like I said in the first place, Night on Earth had been a series of shorts, or a miniseries or whatever, I wouldn't have had this trouble writing the review. Watch the film and tell me about it.

Some have said that they thought the first story with Gena Rowlands and Wyonna Ryder was weak ,but I disagree.That story was about someone being content with who they are not looking for the brass ring. It also left the door open for further possibilities. I loved the New York story for many reasons . Not the least of which is that I live in New York. Excellent casting and a real story of the immigrants who came here to New York and the melting pot we are here in New York. It also showed a real problem that minorities face here in NY trying to hail a cab.Each story had a really excellent theme. The confession theme in Italy had me rolling , while the story of the Helsinki cab driver was really tragic. If you look at how the film begins and ends, there seems to be a opposite end effect. The affluent casting agent stepping off the private jet versus the worker stumbling out of his cab into the morning.This is an excellent film with an excellent cast. I highly recommend it!

The transitions from location to location are beautifully constructed; a series of intimate painterly portraits, introducing you to the vulnerable underbelly of each city. This also applies to the cut scenes between dialogue ... at times I was drooling! The characters are generally so well drawn that we can even forgive Winona Ryder's unconvincing tom-boy mechanic. Each twenty minute story is just long enough to engross and short enough to leave you happy that you didn't waste your time and you're ready for the next. And there's real comedy too ... farce, circus buffoonery and even belly laughs. I must admit, by the last story I did begin to tire a little of the format. It all finishes with not so subtle pathos (which I resisted) which highlights the unrelenting pain of life. Absolutely beautiful. Highly recommended.

My only taste of him before seeing this film was the slightly later 'Dead Man', and I found that to be a very worthwhile experience and one that set me up nicely for Night on Earth. Night on Earth isn't quite as trippy as Jarmusch's later film; but it still oozes that odd sense of cool and while you're watching it you're constantly reminded that what you are seeing isn't just any film. This film is split into five sections, all of which tell a story about a taxi in different parts of the world. Part of the reason why this film is so odd is that all of the stories take place at the same time, which creates a very strange feeling while you're watching it. One problem with films that work in this way is that there's always a weak link in the stories; but here there isn't. All of the stories are of high quality, and all are brilliant in different ways. Of course, everyone will have a favourite and mine has got to be the blackly comic one that takes place in Rome! An excellent ensemble cast, mostly made up of unknowns, helps night on Earth immensely. In fact, it's ironic because the only cast member that doesn't pull her weight is the only one that isn't unknown - Winona Ryder. I'm something of a fan of Ryder; but seeing her in this movie is an awful experience. How anyone could think that she could be cast as a taxi driver, complete with cocky swagger and cigarette in mouth, and get away with it is ludicrous. However, the rest of the cast is really good and all bring realism to their roles. Roberto Benigni is typically over the top, but his performance is very fun and he is an actor that has a great ability to draw you into his performance by the way he speaks. This was capitalised on brilliantly in the masterpiece 'Life is Beautiful', and it's shown here too. The stories in the film don't appear to have an absolute defining point (with the exception of the story in Paris); but it doesn't matter as the musings about life and such are always interesting and the obscure idea of following people in taxis is always amusing. On the whole - a very worthwhile film experience!

Here he unites the world with the same incident -- someone taking a cab -- but different experiences in different cultures.Gena Rowlands is a casting agent landing in LA and being picked up by an offbeat taxi driver (Winona Ryder); Armin Muller-Stahl is an ex-German clown driving a cab in New York who picks up Giancarlo Esposito (who ends up driving) and later Rosie Perez; Isaach DeBankole is a taxi driver in Paris who throws three idiots out of his cab and picks up a blind girl (Beatrice Dalle); Roberto Begnini is a taxi driver in Rome who confesses all kinds of sex acts to the bishop he's driving (Paolo Bonacelli); and Matti Pelonpaa is a cab driver in Helsinki who tells his sad story to his passengers.Each vignette is wonderful and indicative of the country in which the characters reside. My favorite is the New York City sequence, which is out and out hysterical, with Armin Muller-Stahl, Giancarlo Esposito and Rosie Perez, all of whom are fabulous. And if you ever lived in New York, you can relate to the difficulty in getting a cab that will take you to the boroughs, especially late at night - it was all so typical, as the scenes in the other countries probably were as well.I would have to put what is practically a monologue by Roberto Begnini next. It's definitely the most absurd as he confesses the grossest things to the overwhelmed bishop. Very black comedy.If I have a least favorite, it's the first one, as it was fairly predictable and Winona Ryder as a taxi driver with aspirations to be a mechanic was unconvincing. Gena Rowlands, however, looked gorgeous and has an in joke while on the phone I'm supposed to have dinner with Shera and Peter tonight, meaning Shera Danese and Peter Falk, best friends of the Cassavetes.In Mystery Train, Jarmusch shows people visiting Sun Records and ties them all together with one incident, and we see what each character is doing at the time it happens. Very clever. Here, the thing that unites these characters is a cab ride.Very, very enjoyable, with lively characterizations, beautifully directed.

Incredibly touching is also the final chapter in Helsinki with some drunkards exchanging tragic stories only to arrive at sunrise to catch some sleep. Or the one with the black cabbie, who learns to respect a blind woman and makes one wonder Who's really the blind one?

In New York, Armin Mueller-Stahl is an immigrant from East Germany who gets a crash course on American culture after he takes Giancarlo Esposito and Rosie Perez to Brooklyn. Crossing the Atlantic, we first go to Paris where Isaac de Bankole, an Ivorian immigrant who faces the challenge of racism daily, picks up blind woman BÃ©atrice Dalle who could care less what colour his skin is.The last two segments are less about class or race and more humorous and individual. In Rome, Roberto Benigni finds an opportunity to confess a long list of sins after he picks up priest Paolo Bonacelli. This is a hilarious scene, the most extreme part of the film. In Helsinki, Matti PellonpÃ¤Ã¤ brings three drunks home (Kari VÃ¤Ã¤nÃ¤nen, Sakari Kuosmanen, and Tomi Salmela), but after they bemoan their misfortune, he tells them what real suffering is.NIGHT ON EARTH continues the characteristic choice of scenery that Jarmusch offered in his films to date. When so much cinema depicts the US as so many ritzy places and historical landmarks, Jarmusch instead offers vacant lots, dilapidated buildings, and businesses that have long since gone out of business. In Paris, Rome, and Helsinki he also offers nondescript, industrial or residential areas, quite deserted because it is the dead of night.This isn't a flawless film. The opening bit with Winona Ryder feels overacted. The Paris segment is nothing but clichÃ©s about how the blind might not see, but their other senses are more powerful than the sighted. The New York and Helsinki segments are homages to Jarmusch's peers Spike Lee and Aki Kaurismaki respectively, using their settings and borrowing some of their actors. While the New York scene has Jarmusch's characteristic humour, Jarmusch's style is almost completely effaced in the Helsinki scene and one could believe he's watching a Kaurismaki film.Nonetheless, this is a very enjoyable film. Virtually all audiences will enjoy Benigni's wacky comedy, and I've come to appreciate Matti PellonpÃ¤Ã¤'s acting even more.

Inside these taxis characters of a wide assortment of personalities get to interact with each other. The acting is top-notch throughout the entire film, which adds to the real-life feel the film intends to portray. There are, however, a few negative aspects I feel compelled to point out. Because the film moves from one language to another, the audience, depending on their cultural background, native language, or even personal tastes, is bound to connect more with a particular story than the other. This is probably one of most notorious difficulties the film suffers from, as, for instance, the story starring Roberto Benigni most likely entirely differs from the mood of the previous ones and the last story; personally, this story was the one I liked the least, although it was entertaining, if maybe a little bit absurd at times. Also, changing from one story to the other might be a little bit abrupt, as you must immediately adapt to the new characters. Separately, every story works perfectly on their own, but having to watch them together in a 2-hour film might as well represent a heavy task for the viewer. Then again, this is also the strongest aspect of the film, as it succeeds in trying to depict a similar situation in 5 diverse environments. Do not get me wrong, the negative aspects that I pointed out are the ones I believe keep this film from being a complete masterpiece. All in all, the film is excellent, and it definitely should be viewed by anyone interested in cinema, as it is highly innovative.

All the flaws are reversed.Jarmusch has a knack for absurd situations, but 2 important factors constrain him in this case Length 5 minutes per film might be a bit short sometimes to get anything more than a gimmick or gotcha, but 20 minutes, given the confined space, proves tiresome in most of the vignettes. There is simply too little for many of his characters to do or express given the rules Jarmusch has set himself. ClichÃ© not a bad thing in itself when it can be subverted a bit (and to a degree, one of the segments does this with a lot of charm), but here things become a bit too obvious. Of course, the LA segment is a bout filmmaking/acting, the Paris story about sex, and the Scandinavian one had to be about death. Mixing things up could have been more refreshing. The twist to the French one saves it a bit.The consistency of vision helps, something compilations of shorts by various filmmakers lack. But the real saving grace is the performances - with the exception of a typically overbearing Roberto Benigni - and the jewel of the collection, so to speak, that is the Paris segment with the ever- dependable Isaach De BankolÃ©.

I'm a fan of Jarmush's style in writing and directing and he really tries to shine through this film. It tells five different stories about five taxi cab drivers in four different countries in one night. Each story is very different and none of them really begin or end. It is really five snippets of the strange occurrences which happen between us at night. The stories take place in Los Angeles, New York, Paris, Rome, and Helsinki. The film is very loose and very odd, making it interesting yet sometimes hard to really become devoted to.There is no real connection, blatant, or metaphoric, between the five stories. They all seem to be in their own little worlds simply documenting the happenings that go on late at night in taxi cabs. It could be argued that the films only goal is to document these melancholy little tales, not having any other motives and not trying to be any more than an anthology of stories. From this perspective the film just ends up being pretty dull when you look at it as a whole. Each story in its own right is fairly entertaining and it can be plenty amusing, but anything and everything that happens in this film ultimately amounts to nothing. The film really goes nowhere and doesn't seem to accomplish anything. But again, maybe it isn't trying to. Maybe it is simply just a portrait of the quiet night life that occurs in 400 AM taxi cabs. The only thing that is certain is that Jarmush has taken some playful liberties with the storytelling medium and has created a film that is very different.Once you get past the fact that Night on Earth really isn't trying to do anything amazing, you can appreciate it a lot more for the good things about it. Jarmush's script is great and he writes witty banter excellently. There is little to no action in the film. It is all about the dialogue as the actors sit in their taxi cabs and discuss life, death, and everything else. Luckily, the dialogue is the most engaging thing about the film when it needs to be. It is that and the great acting by all the performers. None of the five stories fall flat from an acting standpoint and they only grow more and more interesting until the last story which takes place in Helsinki which is most definitely the most enthralling. There are plenty of great things going for this film, I'm just not sure what any of it is supposed to mean and what purpose anything in this movie serves. Better yet, I don't know that this movie has a purpose.Regardless, Jarmush has made a very interesting film with Night on Earth it is intelligent and almost always entertaining. There's nothing here to make me dislike the film but at the same time that is the problem. There isn't much here so I can't love it either. All in all it is a film of high quality and class, but at the same time it feels a little empty because of no real connection or leading element to fuel the film. Night on Earth is a good film, but it is really nothing more than five separate short stories with no real beginning and no real end.

Jarmusch shows what life is or should be  a succession of sweet funny/essential moments made of chance encounters which could happen everywhere, at any time, even in a cab with somebody you don't know at all. Maybe we are just too blind to see/feel these moments as special as they are though.Moreover, Night on Earth is really funny. A sharp sense of humor. With a tremendous Roberto Benigni making conversation to a priest, speaking alone about pumpkins or sheep. With the so impassive Isaach De BankolÃ©, trying to understand how a blind person could live, before realizing they see better than the sighted.After seeing this movie, you strangely want to become a cab-driver in a big city somewhere...

If you've been exposed to anything by him or at least heard about it, you know that he's not mainstream. He makes movies comparable to short stories(not necessarily the most recent brand of such, those get to be all about your own interpretation, and are very vague). Slices of life. This visits five different cities around the world(New York, Los Angeles, Paris, Rome and Helsinki), and thus contains four different languages(!), as three of these places are in Europe. Different classes and types of people meet, as each time we go to a new place, we follow a cabbie and his fare(sometimes plural), all in this one night, possibly starting at the same time. There is no overarching plot connecting them all; what makes them similar is that they're all human beings with a history and personalities. The realism is high, if there are oddities. Not all the characters are likable(and there are stereotypes among them), but they tend to be interesting and credible(flawed, *real*), same as their backgrounds. The acting is great, with some performances being downright excellent. This is carried by the dialog, what is said(and in what way), and what isn't. Other than establishing shots of the 5 places(that are not all alike, going right from a metropolis to something you could almost call quaint), most of what we see are the drivers and the passengers, there are no flashbacks and occurrences are largely retold, not seen. The editing and cinematography are subtle; the focus here is on the content, not the form. There is also hardly any music, other than the main theme, which has variations on it for where on Earth we are(and in what culture) when we hear it, so to speak. The majority of the humor is discreet, as well, with the obvious exception of Benigni(and arguably the NY segment). There is plenty of swearing, a bit of sexuality in the lines and a little disgusting content in this. I recommend this to anyone who likes pictures like these. 8/10 "},{"Title":"A different type of cinema","Date":"21 May 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" Jim Jarmusch's film Night on Earth is a series of taxi cab encounters, each of which is set in one of five major cities around the world. People of different social origin and background are placed together in the cabs with the knowledge that they (driver and passenger) have only a limited required role to play and that it is unlikely that the other person has or will have any connection to their life in the future so nearly anything goes. Most social pretense is dropped as a result of this and these people are often seen telling things to complete strangers that they wouldn't dare tell their closest companions.With Night on Earth, Jarmusch found a unique way to look at his characters. Nothing life altering happens to these people in the course of the film and there is very little conflict. Drama, conventionally thought of as essential to effective film-making, is eschewed here. Since plot isn't really an issue with this film there is plenty of time to focus on characterization. Thus Night on Earth is populated with no less than a half dozen fully articulated characters while most films struggle to flesh out one or two.It helps, of course, that the characters are interesting and of course people who end up in taxi cabs in the middle of the night tend to be about some intriguing business. We never know, for example, how a Catholic priest ends up needing a cab on a deserted street but we do know plenty about his driver (the manic Roberto Benigni) who describes in great detail three separate sexual encounters, only one of which involves another human. There's also the cocky tomboy driver (Winona Ryder) who is just plain uninterested in something most people would consider the chance of a lifetime. Ultimately, these characters express a wide range of emotion some are funny, some are sad, and some are just curious. Their actions always seem realistic if not necessarily logical.Writer/director Jim Jarmusch does an excellent job giving each scene its own flavor, mostly through aesthetic choices, particularly lighting and framing. The scenes never devolve into theatrics the way many films that have to focus on enclosed spaces do, though, as Jarmusch always knows when it's time to switch to an exterior shot or even take the action outside the cab for a minute or two. Ultimately, Night on Earth succeeds at creating a different type of character based cinema and does so with an admirable sense of style. "},{"Title":"A bumpy ride","Date":"12 November 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" Her name was Lola; she was a sheep. As Roberto Benigni's lascivious taxi driver confides in his incredulous fare, he wanted something that moved, that looks you in the eye... something with a soul. After losing his virginity to a pumpkin, Lola was definitely a step in the right direction. Alas, his embarrassed father sold Lola to an ugly, uneducated butcher for 80,000 lire. I felt so badly, I haven't eaten meat since. By the time he's confessed he's shagged his sister-in-law - her cotton panties reminded him of Lola's fleece - his passenger, a bishop (Bonacelli), is lying dead on the back seat from a shock-induced heart attack. It's 4am what to do? Benigni's powerhouse performance is the high point of a film incorporating five different taxi rides, set during a single night in five cites. In Los Angeles, harried Victoria Snelling (Rowlands) thinks her sweary, tomboy driver Corky (Ryder, not so much chain-smoking as absorbing whole cigarette packets through osmosis) would be perfect for the film she's casting - only Corky turns her down.Over in New York, an East German clown-turned-cabbie (Mueller-Stahl) who doesn't know how to drive, teaches sceptical YoYo (Esposito) the virtue of patience. Meanwhile, in Paris, two outsiders - BÃ©atrice Dalle's sharp-tongued blind girl and her sullen driver (De BankolÃ©), a victim of racial prejudice from the Ivory Coast, reach an understanding.That same night, in Rome, Benigni's cabbie talks his holy passenger to death while making his confession, and, in Helsinki, a laid-off industrial worker and his colleagues (VÃ¤Ã¤nÃ¤nen, Kuosmanen and Salmela) meet a taxi driver (PellonpÃ¤Ã¤) with rather more to be depressed about. Travis Bickle had it easy.We're in familiar Jarmusch territory here, with his recurring theme of loners reaching out to one another in the dead of night. And there's little delights to be found tucked away within these red-eyed meditations; not least Tom Waits' clanking score - evoking the ghosts of New Orleans and Kurt Weill via Captain Beefheart.Night On Earth isn't Jarmusch's best movie - despite some good turns from the cast, it's too uneven, and the weaker segments (Los Angeles, New York) could have been excised without any loss of quality or coherence. Not that the film follows any linear strictures (however inverted, as with the superior Mystery Train) or narrative arc Jarmusch isn't interested in dealing a complete hand here - merely shuffling the deck around and plucking cards at random.The effect is rather like bolting through an exhibition of Edward Hopper paintings at high speed, half-glimpsed nighthawks on the periphery of vision. The whole film is redolent of a Tom Waits lyric from his classic 1985 album 'Rain Dogs' I've seen it all. I've seen it all through the yellow windows of the evening train. "},{"Title":"At night by day","Date":"12 May 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" Jim Jarmusch's Night on Earth is what one could call an international American movie - and therefore almost a contradiction. When normally Americans come to Paris, to Madrid or to Rome, the movies in which they act look like these cities would lie in the US. Not only there is exclusively English spoken, but the actors do not behave as if they were in Europe. Sadly enough, this is even true for Soderberg's The Good German. The worst that can happen, then, is that Americans try to film European history. I do not watch such movies anymore until Unviersal will have agreed to contract Fredy Murer as director of a new American Western.Very different are the movies of the world-versatile Jarmusch, a real Odysseus for whom the Greek attribute polytropos could not better fit - also what the choice of his movies concerns. Although the situations in the different taxi-drives are acted, they are so good as in real life. In order not to spoil the real pleasure that everybody has who has traveled to the cities in which Jarmusch leads us, I give here only a few hints. Masterfully Armin MÃ¼ller-Stahl as taxi-driver and clown who looks as if an UFO had abandoned him amidst New York city. His film-name Grokenberger is a nice allusion to Grock, the greatest clown of all times. Jarmusch's humor gets a bit cynic if he chooses exactly Paolo Bonacelli for the role of the priest who dies in the taxi under the confession of Roberto Benigni the same Bonacelli who was in one of the three leading roles in Pasolini's Salo, a movie that is so full with nausea that people can hardly survive it. To a nice allusion Jarmusch also succeeded in the last episode which shows a cab drive of three drunks in Helsinki. Helsinki is the cinematic seat of whom? Right, of Aki and Mika KaurismÃ¤ki. So, the awaken watcher is not too astonished, when the sober taxi driver is called Mika and the deathly drunk passenger Aki. Also a form of reverence of Jarmusch who is a real Global citizen.

Brilliance pours from every scene of this movie. As you probably know, the film takes place in five taxi cabs in five different cities on the same night. In a film with a such format, it is tempting to comment on which segment is superior but this would be missing the point entirely because Night on Earth is greater than the sum of its five parts, although it is true that the five segments can stand easily on their own. The L.A. segment portrays two very different women, for whom expectations from life differ completely and yet they are both content with who they are and they can somehow connect at some level. The N.Y. segment is hilarious, especially the part played by Rosie Perez. The trio in the taxi can only come together in New York, I guess. The Paris segment works so perfectly on so many different levels. It mainly raises questions about prejudices, not just about where people come from but simply about regarding others who are not like us. At the end, it leaves you asking who is more blind?. The infamous segment in Rome is comedy at its purest and Roberto Benigni in top form. I guess it will be the most bizarre and entertaining confession I will have ever heard of. The Helsinki segment seems to end the film on a sad note but in my opinion, it actually says more Although we sympathize with the two talking passengers since they sympathize with the taxi driver, it is again these two who are inconsiderate to their friend. And as for the driver, although he is deeply sad and wounded, this sadness is a little self-centered and he has no pity to those whom he can actually help. As a whole, in addition to being a very good comedy to make you laugh, this film makes you contemplate about life, people, space and time. It opens in L.A. just about when it is getting dark and ends in Helsinki at dawn. While you actually know that these stories are taking place at the same time, it feels as if you have witnessed a night go by on Earth and have made a unique journey.

"},{"Title":"Beautiful fragments of human life","Date":"19 June 2005","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" There isn't much going on in Jim Jarmusch film, but there's a lot happening beneath the surface. Even more than he is a terrific filmmaker and a wonderful screenwriter, Jarmusch is a great observer of human nature. Even though 'Dead Man' and 'Ghost Dog' are the films that gave him more widespread commercial success, these are not typical of his style; Jarmusch's early film hardly have any plot at all, and all they give us is fragments of human lives. His approach towards his characters is always very up-close and personal, but never first-person; the viewer is always an observant, sometimes as comfortable as a close friend, sometimes too close for comfort, almost a voyeur. And yet, with his incredible insight into the human soul and what makes it tick, Jarmusch makes every one of his characters come to full life &#150; even though there are no internal monologues, no revealing close-ups; Jarmusch creates his characters solely through their behavior; and he understands people so well, that in doing so he completely transcends the boundaries of language, culture and nationality.Like Jarmusch's previous film, 'Mystery Train', 'Night On Earth' gives us several different stories about different characters from different backgrounds. This time, though, there is not the slightest connection between the stories, except a thematic one we are shown five stories taking place in taxi cabs in five different major cities around the world.The first story takes place in Los Angeles, and in it is a twenty year old (but she looks seventeen at most!) Winona Ryder, fresh from her break in Beetle Juice and Edward Scissorhands, who plays a young, perky, smart-ass, chain-smoking taxi driver and gives one of the most brilliant performances of her career; opposite her is another terrific actress, Gena Rowlands, as an uptight, busy Hollywood agent.In the second story, taking place in New York, black Brooklyn native YoYo (Giancarlo Esposito) has a hard time getting a cab in Manhattan, and is finally picked up by Helmut, clown-turned-taxi driver, Eastern German immigrant on his first day at the job (and his first day on an automatic, as well).The third story is located in Paris, in which Isaac De Bankole (the unforgettable Raymond the ice cream man from 'Ghost Dog') plays a taxi driver who's having a bad day, as he picks up a blind woman (Beatrice Dalle) who doesn't make him feel much better.The fourth story, taking place in Rome, is practically full-out Italian comedy, with Jarmusch's old friend Roberto Benigni plays a bizarre taxi driver who's giving a bishop (or is he?) a hard time for his money.Finally, in the fifth story, located in Helsinki, the wonderful Matti Pellonpaa plays Mika, a cheery yet melancholy driver, who picks up three young drunkards and shows to them the true nature of pain.Each one of these stories has a very distinct and unique atmosphere, ranging from comedy to drama, and revealing, often, the different mentalities of the different countries; the humanity, though, runs all the way through. All of Jarmusch's characters are different and yet the same; they are all equally human, and he understands them all, but each one on their own terms. Jarmusch's observation is always brutally frank and sincere, and always loving and forgiving, for all of his characters equally. Night On Earth is sometimes sad, often funny, mostly touching and always beautiful. There may not be much going on, but it never fails to fascinate.

Both comedy and drama, it follows taxi drivers as they ply their trade in different cities around the world. And it includes what may well be the single funniest scene in any movie I have ever witnessed.There have been numerous TV shows and specials following taxi drivers, and their experiences in the remaining years. But in 1991 this idea was unique.It starts in the relative warmth of Los Angeles, and ends in the frigid sadness of Helsinki. There are also stops in New York, Paris, and Rome as well. Each time a driver delivers his ride the clock begins anew in another distant city. Only the time change is different. So, as we follow the drivers we also follow the day as it turns into night.The initial driver, in Los Angeles, picks up a young Winona Ryder. She is a tough street girl, who thinks she is ready for all that might come her way.But it is Roberto Benigni as the late-working driver who picks up a fare long into the night in Rome that separates this movie for me. While already a star in Italy, Benigni was new to American eyes. I was not aware of his talents of wearing his heart on his sleeve. His wandering eyes. The rapid speak, and even more rapid hands. While everyone else in Rome sleeps, including his ride, Roberto begins an ever-deepening confession to the sleepy, perhaps even drunk, Priest who sits in the back. I won't spoil it, but it is SO funny and SO outrageous you will be literally on the floor.It is not, as yet, on DVD. What a shame. I'd love to see it again with great quality.

Always visually very fine, serious in his look at the modern world, and so often funny at the same time.

Of course in saying this I immediately place myself as more a fan of Down By LAw, Mystery Train, and Night on EArth, than his other less comic films.

Night on earth is about power and the silliness of our assumptions about social status, being in control, sexual mores, power and moral strength. We are still not too far from the animal world, but instead of brute force, we use social conventions to establish a pecking order in every situation. We move into any social environment with some expectations about our place in it relative to the status of others. Night on earth is a little study of these expectations. Every one of the episodes has a beautiful triangle of power, morals and expectations.The cabbie - the casting agent - her boss/client in LAThe cabbie - Yoyo - his sister-in-law in New YorkThe cabbie - the priest - the transvestites in RomeThe cabbie - the diplomats - the blind girl in ParisThe cabbie - the drunk - his friends in HelsinkiThe casting agent of the LA story is socially superior to the dirty little cabbie girl (played delightfully by Winona Rider;) but we soon learn that she is not on top; she is a slave of the demands of her job, the whims of her boss/client. When she tries to assert her status by condescending to the cabbie girl the whole structure of assumptions falls apart. Status is meaningless if you do not want it. In the end the true strength award goes to the Corky. We see the same idea evolving in the other episodes as well.Every story starts with an assumption, an assumption of social order that first gets twisted then turned completely upside down. This twist and turn is played out with flawless consistency in each episode.Whichever character appears to be the weakest in the setup of our social assumptions turns out to be the strongest by the end of the ride.I will not bore you analyzing them all and you do not need to see it for its 'deeper meaning.' This is one those wonderful movies that can entertain at any level. I've never seen Roberto Benigni this funny or Rosie Perez this cute and sexy.

Jarmusch ones said that he's not particularly interested in plots but rather in characters. This notion is very evident in this motion picture. There is no structural story line, this is five different & rather short tales all tied up by external elements. The characters are all truly amazing, in some films it takes virtually the whole dramatisation to attain the feeling that you familiarised with the characters, in one way or the other. In some films, you never even come close to such an accomplishment. But in this one, however, you merely need a brief cab ride to really feel the presence and the acquaintance. Apart from enjoying all the cab rides greatly I exceptionally laughed and yet sincerely fathomed the tragedy of the second New York ride. The situation Helmut, a German immigrant, finds himself in is really sorrowful, as it is very comical as well. For a reason beyond comprehension he has though his bad English and very severe driving accomplished to obtain a taxi driver card in a city he practically doesn't know the name of. Somewhat accidentally he managed to pick up Yo-Yo, an energetic, talkative & very amusing New Yorkian. Two greatly distinct cultures persuaded to make conversation is extremely charming, interesting & humorous, though they can hardly understand each others nature they still manage to somewhat interpret each other in a very abstruse way. The actors did all perform admirably well and genuine.The music by Tom Waits is extremely well fitting. He did a great job to include this kind of wandering state that this film is based upon, kind of a tip-toeing approach. Which is a quite well describing way of defining this elegant film.

I found the New York and Rome 'stories' to be the most entertaining and creative.  Oscar Nominee Armin Mueller-Stahl (Shine) portrays a newly landed East German defector who is a New York cab driver without being able to drive effectively.  Giancarlo Esposito and Rosie Perez play two New Yorkers who aside from being his fares for the night also develop a friendship with the outsider. However it is in the fourth story, set in Rome which truly shines through.  Italian comic/artist Roberto Benigni portrays a talkative cabbie who is driving a bishop home.  Benigni feels this is the right time to confess his sons which are so 'adulterous' that the bishop 'croaks'.  Even for those non-Italians, just watching Benigni tell the story will have you dying of laughter. Benigni demonstrates why he is one of the funniest men of this generation and compared to the likes of Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin and the Marx Brothers.

Those familiar with his work will most likely find plenty to like, while others might find it slow, boring, and pointless. Even as a fan of Jarmusch, I admit this has it's slow spots. However, it's mostly quite entertaining. The second segment, where we have a East-German refugee who can't handle driving a cab in the city is probably the best segment as we see him and his passenger struggle communicating with each other. The third segment is also quite hilarious with Benigni being a sex-obsessed cabbie. Benigni fans in particular should love that segment. As a Tom Waits fan, the use of Waits' music in between segments only adds to the greatness of the movie. Overall, this is more entertaining than Jarmusch's Coffee & Cigarettes and I'm glad this has finally been released on DVD.

With the German actor being a cap driver in NY picking up a black man named Jojo at the curb at an ice cold night the story begins. Trying to get to Brooklyn in vain the two stop shortly after the departure to switch the driving positions as Helmut &#150; Armin's acting name &#150; is driving awfully bad. While driving they talk aunts and uncles and so the audience gets to know that Helmut is an immigrant from East Germany for instance. By the time they pick up Jojo's sister in law at a corner on their way to their destination as the two have a tough dispute outside the taxi they continue during the whole trip. At least the three of them arrive at Jojo's house and he's giving Helmut some instructions how to find the way back but actually he doesn't understand him. That's a typical problem of immigrants and thus Helmut is a fine example. Armin portrays him as badly English speaking person with a humorous but chaotic character. Jojo instead is the characteristical black man from Brooklyn swearing and joking around and that's why it's so easy to identify with them as they are as ordinary as most of us. Besides the stars the camera movement is also significant for the movie. In this case the shot is mostly a close up as most of the time the story takes place inside Helmut's cap. The camera is focused on the characters to show their mood and manner because it provides again more identification. Additionally the actors intend to deal with the topic of immigration which succeeds well in the movie. Helmut is portrayed as an ordinary guy trying to build up a new existence in the United States but the recognizes that it's a hard way and great endeavors are necessary to fulfill it. All in all this movie is definitely worth watching as it deals with the topic of immigration in an ironic but funny way and after having finished it's really your night on earth.

The famous German actor Armin Mueller-Stahl participates as a former Clown from East Germany, who has emigrated to New York and tries to make ends meet by driving a unaccustomed cab. He picks up the black guy Jo-Jo, played by Giancarlo Esposito, and they both enjoy their time together, though they have two different characters, lifestyles and origins. The cab drivers personality is shown by the way he tries to drive the cab with an automatic transmission, which is usual in the US, not in Germany at that time. After behaving patient for a long time, Jo-Jo finally suggests to drive himself home. Helmut Grokenberger, the driver does not mind and lets this black guy drive, normally impossible in the US. Jo-JO finally stops the cab in a dirty, dark and rough neighborhood, because he catches sight of his sister in law. After having caught her and finally, after a lot of opposition having pressed her into the cab, she begins to argue within Jo-Jo and uses f*** in one sentence at least twice. Finally you can say that this film surely did not have a big budget and it is really not needed because the camera mostly shows the main characters inside the cab. These characters symbolize the clichÃ© about European immigrants, who try to live the so-called American Dream, but also the clichÃ© about Black Americans.

Fast forward through the first story with Gena Rowlands and Winona Ryder  it is wooden, boring and unconvincing.  All the other four stories, however, are funny, touching and entertaining throughout.The second story pits the unlikely pair of Helmut and Yo-Yo, (not to mention the typically verbose Rosie Perez), and has the right tone of humor and sadness.  I wish we could have seen more of this brief friendship.The last three stories are all foreign.  The Paris chapter concentrates on a black cab driver who is made fun of by foreign (and also black) dignitaries.  He is proud, until later he finds a cynical blind woman and he becomes curious about her.  It's not riveting, but it does hold interest.The fourth story from Rome would be normal slapstick fare ... if it weren't for the manic comedy of the great Roberto Benigni.  His monologue to the priest in the back seat of the cab - even when read, not heard - is hysterically funny, with Benigni giving the perfect blend of absurdism and sincerity.  You can't tell whether he is telling the truth or not, and you can see where the comic brilliance that produced Life is Beautiful comes from.The fifth cab takes place in Helsinki (that's in Finland, right?) Three drunks get into a cab, one of whom has had the worst day imaginable.  Then the cabbie tells a tale of his own, and it puts the unlucky drunk's problems in proper perspective.The great thing about this film (other than the various locales) is that each one could work as a stage play, or a radio play.  It's about people, and what different people can learn about each other, even if they are put together by chance.  None of the combinations of driver/passenger would probably remain friends in normal life, but for the brief moments they are together, they gain (or in the Rome story, lose) something as a result of the other's experience.

Now, everybody will call me stupid.","Date":"9 January 2012","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" Few directors enjoy the cult status that Jarmusch does. Sadly, he is praised undeservedly, this film is not ingenious. So why do people praise him so much? The answer may appear at the conclusion of this review.The film's plot revolves around five taxi rides around the world, at night. They take place in Los Angeles, New York, Paris, Rome and Helsinki.The way the movie is filmed is unambitious, the camera is placed in the taxi, the driver in the front seat (to the right of the screen), the passenger in the back seat (to the left of the screen). Technically (camera placement, cinematography, lighting etc) Jarmusch doesn't offer us anything new, so people shouldn't praise him for this.The worst part about this movie is the plot. Jarmusch shows us long and boring monologues, uninteresting dialogue and a very weak plot. This is why no studio will ever finance him. Oh, but he's proud of that, isn't he? The way people talk, and what they say is very boring. Even if you have a great actor playing the part, and saying the lines in a very interesting way, this doesn't make you interested. Imagine Morgan Freeman, or David Letterman saying We're out of milk. Even if they do say it in a way which is most accurately described as awesome, you're still not interested. The great Kurosawa said Though a mediocre director can sometimes make a passable film out of a good script, even an excellent director can never make a good film out of a bad script. Jarmusch wrote this script in eight days. Jarmusch wrote a very bad script. You can say, but this is how people talk in real life. If we were more entertained by real life than by movies, the movie industry would cease to exist. The reason we watch movies is to see something that we don't see everyday. Showing me something real, something I can see everyday bores me. He isn't just showing people the way they talk in real life, he is showing us real life. He might as well have turned the camera on in a cab, and made a movie out of it. Writing a script in eight days is not impressive, it's insulting, he didn't put enough effort into it and it ends up sucking. If you are making a movie, put more effort into the script, because people watch movies. People deserve better, especially if they are paying to see the movie. Nothing happens in this movie, I'm serious, it's just people talking in a cab! That's it, nothing more! Jarmusch has said that he would rather make a movie about a man walking his dog, than a movie about the emperor of China. Does he LOVE emptiness in a movie? Does he LOVE a movie that has no story, or a very weak one? He is the biggest enemy of all fiction, he hates a good story, and he loves a bad one. He loves boring things. The most interesting thing about Jarmusch is his hair. The script is the major fault in this movie, because of the bad script the movie is terrible.The film has some good acting, I guess. Nothing memorable, though. Roberto Benigni is a great actor and director, see A beautiful Life. Winona Rider is also respectable. The person who plays the Norwegian cab driver is very good, and his monologue, I will admit, is well written. It's not the imagery we see in Bergman's Persona, a film which contains the single best monologue in history, but it's good. Jarmusch probably worked a whole day on it.The music in the film is not consistent with the tone. People talking in a cab at night is not Jazz. It's not The Blues. It's just people talking in a cab. Jarmusch put it in, probably because he likes Jazz, that's it.Why people like him still alludes me, but I'll give it a shot. It's because they don't want to like what everybody else likes. They want to be unique. They want to see independent film making, they probably also like Indy rock. It's OK to like something, but to wrongly preach about how great it is, when it's really just boring, and act as if you are better than people who don't like this film for a reason, that's wrong. I don't like this film for the reasons above, why you like it, I don't know. Maybe I'm just too stupid to get Jarmusch.

I thought that I had never before seen such an utterly pointless or pretentious movie in my life, and I probably never would again. It was many years later I ventured to watch another Jarmusch film. The second was Stranger Than Paradise and, while I still felt it was fairly pointless, I also felt it had its moments. It was interesting and occasionally aesthetically pleasing. From there, I explored much of the director's filmography, and found a few films that I really liked, foremost among them being Broken Flowers, his most recent. But I'd have to say, the majority of his movies I do find to be rambling exercises in cinematic pointlessness, even if they are sometimes interesting. I even found Dead Man tolerable on the second viewing.Unfortunately, I have come to Night on Earth, and I'm pretty much right back where I started. Following in the footsteps of the pretty good Mystery Train, Jarmusch directed another film with several different stories in it. This one is comprised of five different nighttime cab rides in five different cities, L.A., New York, Paris, Rome and Helsinki. Basically the film is just about cabbies' interactions with their customers. But there's little, almost nothing, really, of interest in any of these characters or conversations. Only one of the five sequences I found even remotely worth sitting through, the New York City episode, where the only cab black man Giancarlo Esposito can hail belongs to a German immigrant, Armin Mueller-Stahl, fresh off the boat. He doesn't even know how to drive, so Esposito persuades Mueller-Stahl to let him drive instead. Along the way from Manhattan to Brooklyn, they run into Esposito's sister-in-law, Rosie Perez. As in all the segments, nothing much happens during this cab ride, but I did enjoy the little friendship the two men build in the short time they know each other. Even this one ends horribly, though, with Jarmusch leaving Mueller-Stahl in dire straits. The worst segment by far is the Rome one, where Roberto Benigni plays a sunglasses-at-night kind of driver who loves to talk. He picks up a clergyman who becomes stupefied at the driver's chattering. Jarmusch kind of discovered Benigni in Down by Law, and the guy was almost tolerable there. But here he is so over-the-top that I eventually stopped reading the subtitles. I don't know why I just didn't fast-forward it to the final sequence, as none of the sequences are related anyway. This was definitely one of the more painful movies I've watched of late.

Back before Tarantino burst out onto the scene with Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, Jarmusch was the big name in independent cinema. He's not as popular nowadays, but still retains a loyal group of followers. Night on Earth is a good example of his early style of film-making. Its very much focused on characters and dialog opposed to action, and sometimes resembles a play. The dialog is comedic but so dry it'll garner more smirks than belly laughs (with the exception of Benigni's part). Also, the cast is compromised for the most part of familiar faces and character actors.The cast, for the most part, equip themselves nicely. Roberto Benigni, an actor / comedian whom I usually cannot tolerate (he grates on my nerves almost as much as Adam Sandler), is actually quite watchable because of the strength of Jarmusch's hilarious storytelling. Armin Mueller-Stahl and Giancarlo Esposito are also very funny and entertaining to watch. Matti PellonpÃ¤Ã¤, Isaach De BankolÃ© and BÃ©atrice Dalle are all very good in the more serious parts, all of which tackle serious social issues. The fact Jarmusch manages to blend the dry comedy with the drama and make them appear seamless is quite impressive. The only sequence I didn't really like was the first one, because Winona Ryder gives a pretty lousy performance. She's trying way too hard and appears as self-conscientiously indie, and no one would buy her as a gritty tomboy cab driver.The direction itself by Jarmusch is what we've come to expect from him. In other words, very minimalist but fitting the material well. He maintains a nice atmosphere throughout the whole film, and despite being slightly overlong, it never actually becomes dull. Night on Earth is recommended to anyone interested in his work.

The forth one in Rome with Roberto Benigni picking up a priest and then decides to confess right in the cab about having sex with a pumpkin and then a sheep. The fifth one in Helsinki in which the driver picks up three men and one of them has had a terrible day and the cab driver listens to his story and has an even more depressing story. The first two stories just don't work that well but they get much better with the last three.

The tobacco companies tried   to include it, but Director Jim Jarmusch had too much integrity to   allow it.    But what could be a more natural setting for sucking on the killer weed   than the inside of a taxi cab? Here we've got five of them. The tobacco   companies saw the script and fronted mass bucks, or actually in this   case, for a small Indie episodic venture by a director without a   commercial hit to his credit, they fronted small bucks and sent an   accountant.    Anyway, this is a collection of five short stories filmed at night in   five cities, Los Angeles, New York, Paris, Rome, and Helsinki. In the   first, Winona Ryder is an L.A. cabby looking like a ninth-grade grunge   girl with her own sweet dreams who picks up Hollywood casting director   Gena Rowlands at LAX and takes her to Beverly Hills. It's a cute idea,   their bonding, but Ryder is without subtlety and clichéd to the hilt in   dark glasses, bubble gum, baseball cap on backwards, and the endless   puffing, talking sarcastically out of the side of her mouth All   right, MOM. I actually expected some Joan Jett and the Blackhearts in   the background. Rowland is very good however and overcomes a cloying   script.     In New York, veteran German character actor Armin Mueller-Stahl,   looking for all the world like a dead ringer for Albert Einstein, is   the cabby, Helmut, and Giancarlo Esposito is Yoyo, his fare. Problem is   Helmut drives with one foot on the gas pedal and the other on the brake   so that the cab starts and stops every two seconds. So they switch   positions. Meanwhile Rosie Perez arrives for a cameo.    In Paris, Isaach De Bankolé is the cabby and blind Béatrice Dalle, in   white zombie contact lenses, is his fare. This is perhaps the best   piece. Bankolé, who is a black dude from the Ivory Coast, asks her   kindly, Don't blind people usually wear dark glasses? She has the   great rejoinder, Do they? I've never seen a blind person.    Roberto Benigni is the cabby in Rome. He picks up a priest and to the   priest's great discomfort confesses in vivid detail his rather   revolting sexual experiences.    Finally in Helsinki we have Matti Pellonpää as the taksi driver. The   stark lighting on the snow and the empty streets captures well the cold   northern night. Incidentally, the European stories are done in the   local language with subtitles.    This is obviously an art film and requires a relatively sophisticated   audience. The editing isn't sharp (some of that's deliberate) and the   dialogue is uneven, but some of the camera work is excellent. See it   for the acting, which is mostly very good.

The driver in the third and the french more than make up for his passengers eyes. Also the music and the drive after the dialogue with the blind girl helps you drift off but not as much as in the NY episode.Worth watching - make up your own meaning. Though isn't it nice just to wonder why. Are you blind or what?In fact the music all the way through.I'm not sure whether I could watch this at the movies but enjoyed watrchin at home while ill.

Five pointless stories about five foreign cabdrivers. This film makes you think that something is going to happen around the next turn but nothing does, no cool twists or anything funny just boring stories that made my girlfriend fall asleep. The first two stories were better than the last three. The boring story with Winona Ryder was probably the best, this was one of her first films and must not have read the script very well. She must have needed some money real bad to decide to do this horrible movie. Get ready to put your ear plugs in when you see Rosie Perez coming with her annoying shrieking voice of darkness! This scene was really annoying even the drunks in the ghetto wanted to tell her to shut up. I was hoping that each story might have some type of twist coming into the plot, but they never did and I was very surprised I watched the last two stories, they just got worse as they went along. The last three of them are even captioned, you actually have to take the extra energy to read the words, so really!!! &#x96; Don't bother with this movie, it really sucked. Absolutely pointless, none of them had any substance.

It tries too hard to be hip and strange all at the same time. Winona Ryder starts out this farce by trying to be cool and clueless at the same time. Doesn't work! I don't know how this film ends, but somehow I believe if I had made it to the end I would be really angry with myself for wasting two hours of my time!

Anyone who has flown once or twice will realize that the director had no money to employ extras at the LAX location.  Never in the history of aviation has a coast-to-coast passenger stood alone at the prime baggage shoot location at the luggage carousel just before the bags to drop.  Unreal.  Fantasy.The phone calls were poorly acted and unbelievable.  Painfully obvious plot devices.  The station wagon's windows were up in one scene, then down when an actor needed to reach through, then up, then down again.  Continuity -- not!  Wider's fake auto driving was poor -- a chronic three inch back-and-fourth jerk all the way from LAX to the Hills.  Not real life.Segment #2A comedy with funny moments pulled down by obnoxious over-acting.  Emotional aspects were played two notches above real life.  One other reality check taxi passengers cannot be locked inside the back of a cab.  Locking and unlocking is controllable from inside the back seat.Segment #3A stunning looking blind women.  A most interesting concept.  Most interesting.  However, the execution of Segment #3 went no where.  For a blind lady wanting to use a taxi to go home, she certainly was dropped off far from her doorstep!  Huh? Segment #4 + #5I ran out fast towards the end of Segment #3 hoping to avoid the film's slow, pretentious Gypsie theme music -- ineffective, awkward and out of place.  "}]
