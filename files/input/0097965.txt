I personally like Scorsese's introducing segment the most, Life Lesson. Even if I personally is not a fan of Nick Nolte, the movie has depth and it's just as good as you would expect from a director like Scorsese. Unlike many other directors, Scorsese manages to capture sexual attraction, in this case felt by the main character (Nolte). Freshly photographed and good ending that makes you recall upon your own life. Not a masterpiece but indeed great.Coppola's segment Zoe is a total disaster. It is beautifully filmed, but the acting and the story is far below good. Better fit for the children's hour on TV. I don't know if the story was supposed to be ironical, a satire of spoiled extremely rich kids on Manhattan, which could be the fact since there were some scenes where the young girl interacts with a homeless man. That could have been a good theme, if it was Coppola's intention, but no matter the case - it just don't work. It is silly and it doesn't feel satirical at all. Another idea is that it was supposed to be funny, a short comedy, however, neither does it work on that layer. It somewhat makes me lose my respect for the director.Woody Allen's part however is a pleasant refresher after Coppola's borer. Very funny, typical Allen, good acting from Allen's side and good music.Overall rating is a mere 6, dragged down by Coppola. Without his segment I would rate this movie an 8.

What a magnificent work - visually it is as powerful as the painting Nolte's Lionel was painting. Combining in one short film Procul Harum's A whiter shade of pale and Puccini's Nessun Dorma from Turandot was a stroke of genius. This film is an ode to the power of talent; it is about greatness and curse of the gift, not about love to the woman. The best scene of the film and I'd say one of the best ever made about the Artist's work is Nolte triumphantly painting his masterpiece - his love, desire, lust, cries, whispers, tears, and humiliations magically transform with every stroke of his brush into the immortal, triumphant, brilliant work of art. By the time the painting is finished, he would need a new source of inspiration and self-torture, and the cycle will repeat over again. Devilishly clever portrait of an Artist as Not a Young Man. 9.5/10 I loved Woody Allen's Oedipus Wrecks and I think it is very funny and touching. Looks like Allen has met mothers or grandmothers like Mrs. Millstein in real life and his little gem is his love-hate letter to them. In the end, mom always knows what is best for her little boy. Mae Questel and Julie Kavner (Marge Simpson) were wonderful. Woody's face after his mom disappears and the scene when he practically makes love to the chicken drumstick are pure delight; also the commentary that New York is used to everything and readily accepts the crazy situation - it is so true. One of the best Allen's films I've seen lately - I am very glad that I finally saw it.Larry David (Seinfeld, Curb Your Enthusiasm) plays the Theater Manager. It made me think if Estelle Costanza created by David and Mrs. Millstein (Woody's omnipresent mother) have a lot in common in making the lives of their sons miserable and smothering them with their merciless love? 9/10 Coppola's Life Without ZoÃ« was much weaker than Scorsese's and Allan's stories and paled in comparison - this episode from the lives of the reach and beautiful was pretty and cute but you can skip it. 5/10 "},{"Title":"Allen's was hilarious, Scorsese's was interesting, Coppola's was unnecessary","Date":"14 May 2005","Score":"25 out of 33 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" New York Stories tells three tales of the Big Apple.

Martin Scorsese's Life Lessons is a good example of what caliber of work Scorsese had when he made those three student films in the 1960's.  It is a film that has a lot of depth, but it is quite worth it for fans of the actors and those who could get interested in Richard Price's story.Coppola, director of THE GODFATHER and APOCALYPSE NOW makes Life Without Zoe here, a film that is 180 degrees out of whack from those two movies in that it tells the story of a little rich girl whose best friend is a doorman and revolves around a rich boy's birthday party.  In a way, it almost could appeal to kids, but it's the wrong place to put in between a story of artists by Scorsese and a comedy of mother and son troubles by Allen.Which brings me to the last short film, Oedipus Wrecks, where Woody plays a character whose mother suddenly out of the blue disappears.  This is a good showing of what Woody can do in comedy without having to have a picture length presentation (not that he makes many bad films by the way). So, New York Stories is worth checking out for Life Lessons and Oedipus Wrecks, and there could be an audience somewhere for Life Without Zoe, although the biggest flaw of the movie comes that neither one can connect at all outside of the fact that they all take place in New York and are made by New York directors- in short- fascinating and imperfect in some ways.

This featurette would've been a welcome change of pace for Woody at the time given that he hadn't made a flat-out silly comedy for a while and he manages to make good use of every moment. He has a great cast,(Kavner, Questral are particular standouts) and a genuinely strange premise to work with and the results are a riot, dare I say one of Woody's best. So what's so unsatisfying? As good as Oedipus Wrecks is , it still suffers because it has to follow Coppolla's god awful and charmless Life Without Zoe. Seriously I had absolutely no clue what the hell was going on in this obnoxious, cutesy-poo clinker. Can anyone help me understand why Coppola thought anyone would like this? Sitting through Zoe is so emotionally draining that by the time you get to Oedipus you're too annoyed and confused to fully enjoy it. As a result Scorsese's Life Lessons comes off the best of the three. Nolte and Arquette are flawless and the intensity and friction between them make for an engaging if not distressingly tense 35 minutes.

What you can do is applaud theidea, the approach, and the coming together of three big New Yorkfilmmakers to entertain and delight the viewer each in their uniqueway.Segment one is Life Lessons, starring Nick Nolte and RosannaArquette, and directed by Martin Scorsese.  It's a superbly actedand tightly directed little film about a cantankerous and love-lornold abstract painter and his young female assistant, the object ofhis rejected affections.  Nolte and Arquette play off each with greatchemistry (often explosive at that) and the pacing, cinematographyand storyline flow easily creating a real sense of the chaotic inner- psychosis behind artist beauty.  It was also really interesting tosee the large canvas that is the centre-piece of the film take shapefrom nothing to a real work of admirable art by the story's end.   8/ 10 on this one.The second segment, Life Without Zoe, by Francis Ford Coppolais, to put it frankly, horrible!  Unbelievably boring, and so poorlyacted that I can only imagine Coppola himself had fallen asleepsomewhere in pre-production and was awakened when the filmwas released sometime the next year.  Coppola has a knack forcasting young girls with no experience and/or talent in his films(ie., his daughter in GODFATHER III) and Heather McComb as Zoeis no exception.  I actually stopped it 10 minutes in and fast- forwarded to the last segment.  1/10, truly pitiful in every regard.  The gem of the compilation (and saving grace) comes in the finalsegment, Woody Allen's hilarious Oedipus Wrecks.  This waslaugh-out-loud funny.  Allen plays a middle-aged lawyer who's lifeis made unbearable by his doting/nagging Jewish mother, playedbrilliantly by Mae Questel.  Not only is this the best piece of thethree shorts that make up NEW YORK STORIES, but one of thevery best of Woody Allen's films, period.  The tight interactivedelivery between characters that has become so trademark inAllen's films is served up so deliciously again by the likes of JulieKavner, Mia Farrow, Larry David, and the aforementioned mother &son team.  Every facial expression sported by Woody is a gut- buster as well (special mention goes to Jessie Keosian, as hisdeaf Aunt Ceil, for the same reason).  Witty, biting, and with one ofTHE oddest plot twists I've ever seen, Oedipus Wrecks is theicing on the cake, and a great ending to this film conjunction.  9/10,has to be seen for the chicken drumstick love-scene if nothingelse!Unfortunately, the film over-all is not an even delivery despite thenoble attempt.  Scorsese and Allen shine with their spot-on storiesof intrinsic inhabitants of the Big Apple; Coppola just provides theworm.  I can only recommend portions of the film and as such canonly give it a 7/10 in good conscience.  Enjoy what you can!

I happen to think all three films had something to offer, and the fact that the Zoe sequence is about a child does not for me make it the weakest segment.I found the Scorcese segment starring Nick Nolte and Roseanna Arquette the most thought-provoking, the Zoe segment the most charming, and the Allen segment the wackiest. The first episode is about a tortured artist (Nolte) who expresses his sexual frustrations and problems with his young protÃ©gÃ©e (Arquette) in his work. She no longer sleeps with him and wants to quit New York and go home; he wants to kiss her foot and professes undying love for her. To Puccini's Nessun Dorma, he stares at his artwork and goes through a variety of emotions as he paints another masterpiece. This particular muse in the form of Arquette used up, one sees him at his art show connecting with another would-be artist/muse whose identity will also be lost in his genius.The second sequence, directed by Coppola, is a take-off on the Eloise stories by Kay Thompson. This little girl's name is Zoe. Her father, Claudio Montez (Giancarlo Giannini), is a famous flautist who travels, and her mother (Talia Shire) is a photo journalist who travels. Zoe lives with a butler and her dog Vegas at the Sherry Netherlands Hotel. She proves herself smarter than either parent in this charming film. My only question is why Giancarlo Giannini speaks Italian to his daughter when the name Claudio Montez is emphatically not Italian. Okay, it wasn't typical Coppola, but who said it had to be? The last one is pure Woody, Oedipus Wrecks, about a man with a nagging, critical mother who wants to marry a young woman (Mia Farrow) with children. He loves his mother, but he wishes she'd disappear. During a magic show, he gets his wish, when his mother goes into a magician's box and never comes out. Later she shows up in the sky telling him what to do, with the world as a witness. His girlfriend can't take it. He then goes to a psychic (Julie Kavner) who makes him a boiled chicken dinner. A complete delight.Three different, interesting stories by three great directors.

Other anthology films that I've seen, like Four Rooms, have not been very good despite the amazing credentials. I haven't been a fan of most movies with more than one director, hence more than one vision thus many colliding like an orchestra playing unharmonious notes. New York Stories is satisfactory however, eve if its mood swings leave one feeling many different ways about it. You'll feel stimulated, yet strangely unfulfilled.Martin Scorsese's segment, Life Lessons, is very melodramatic in that hardened, grungy way of his. Nolte gives a wonderful performance, very intense, and Arquette is very realistic and effective. Scorsese employs his usual machine gun multi-genre soundtrack and plunging, stylistically passionate and energetic cinematography. His segment says something very profound and important about the human characteristic of selfishness and how much more abundant it is in ourselves than we care to accept.Then comes Francis Ford Coppola's segment, Life Without Zoe. Arg. The acting, despite the leniency one may generously give child actors, is awful. Heather McComb did in fact fill out very very nicely when she grew up, but that does not excuse her very scripted performance here. She's the least of the cast's problems, though. Everyone sounds like the salesmen on the used car commercials. The story is something quite silly. Perhaps it would be fine if it were its own film, but Coppola had to know that he was being teamed with Scorsese, his fellow creator of quintessential Mafia cinema, and Woody Allen, the prolific source of mature and sophisticated comedies about sex and relationships. Did he submit this segment for shock value? I guess so. Well, it worked. I don't understand why Coppola works with kids. His daughter Sophia, who at age 18 here co-wrote the script and designed the costumes, did in fact go on to become a fine director herself, but did he not notice his pattern after awhile? He makes The Conversation, the Godfather films, and Apocalypse Now, and we think he's found his niche. Then he starts making movies like this, following up with films like Jack with Robin Williams.Woody Allen's segment saves the film. I suppose this is one way anthology movies are interesting. In a single feature-length narrative film, when it takes a plunge in the middle, it can't really be saved in the end, especially if it was as bad as Coppola's segment. In an anthology, if the middle of the movie is terrible, you still have the end to look forward to. This is the case in New York Stories, because Woody Allen's segment, Oedipus Wrecks, the final third of the movie, is hilarious. It's one of the funniest satires he's ever done of the Jewish Brooklynite's culture. It's goofy in a subtle way, and fascinatingly surreal the way a lot of Allen's best and most creative work is. Actually, Oedipus Wrecks is perhaps the only one of the three parts that actually clearly represents a hue of New York's culture. Scorsese's part didn't represent New York as much as it represented the emotional tempests of an artist and happened to take place in the meatpacking district. Coppola's mid-section represented the lives of wealthy children whose lives are so free that they live practically like very spoiled and gossipy adults, but to such an outlandish degree of family-oriented fantasy that it's not at all credible. Woody Allen firmly focuses upon his division of New York culture. And by the by, it's a very pleasant surprise to see a younger Larry David, pre-Seinfeld and pre-Curb Your Enthusiasm, in a bit role in Oedipus Wrecks.Whatever was going through Coppola's mind, it's because of him that New York Stories can be described as a film in the shape of a circular saw. It's on one level, then takes a ninety- degree plunge to a different level, then again with the third segment it takes a ninety-degree ascension to the precise level it was at before.

The guy is bearded, long-haired, unkempt, unwashed, and generally unappealing. Further, he puts on rock music to fuel his inspiration and cranks it up LOUD. Yet his off-beat interpretation grew on me. By the time the story was over, I was impressed. He did a more than credible job with the role, helped along by whomever was actually doing the painting. Just as interesting was his oft-pathetic interaction with Rosanna Arquette, who plays his delectable but cruel assistant. She is jealous of his artistic success, fed up with his ambivalence toward her own work, and tired of his disturbing habits. I've seen her in a handful of roles and she never looked more attractive or did a better job, her Joni Mitchell sort of appeal at its most layered and alluring. Nolte, as the painter, was so hung up on her that he would do anything to keep her around. For example, he takes her to a party and watches helplessly as she leaves with a young upstart, returns with the guy to Nolte's own loft, and then spends the night with him right under her mentor's nose. Ooooo! That hadda hurt.I agree with the other reviews that wondered what the heck the Coppola flick was doing in the middle of this otherwise interesting montage. It would've been far more appropriate as the after school movie on TV.The Woody Allen flick, Oedipus Wrecks, was quite amusing. Nothing much to say about it other than it was a fairly typical Woody Allen movie. I always wondered how, in real life, Mia Farrow could go from Frank Sinatra to Woody Allen, such different sorts of men, but that's another question entirely. Both Farrow and Allen deliver good performances here. I especially liked his zany antics with the psychic.

Nick Nolte gives another excellent performance as the painter torn between his love of a woman and his love of his career. He portrays the role perfectly, surrounded by a talented co-stars. Scorsese's direction is again brilliant, showing he truly is one of the greats of contemporary cinema. (5/5)Following Scorsese is Francis Ford Coppola, director of The Godfather series. Unfortunately, following Scorsese is something even Coppola can't succeed at doing. His film is often pretentious and naive, at times even ludicrous. None of the performances are stand-out, and the direction is subpar knowing what Coppola is capable of (The Godfather and Part 2 being two of the most amazing films of all-time). But, at the same time the film isn't BAD. It just could have been much better. (2/5)Woody Allen completes the package with another hilarious comedy, this time crammed into around 40 minutes. The story is a little over-the-top in parts but when directed and acted by Allen it works without fault. Taking such a simple thing as a mother's forceful nature and turning it into a successful short comedy is something only Allen could be so successful at doing. (4/5)New York Stories is overall an excellent compilation, showcasing three of the best film directors of our time and indeed of ALL time. Scorsese and Allen put together excellent pieces and showed their talents to the world, unfortunately Coppola couldn't do the same.What if New York Stories 2 was made today?

So I will comment on them individually.The first short, 'Life Lessons', is directed by Martin Scorsese and is about Lionel Dobie, an artist (Nick Nolte) whos girlfriend Paulette (Rosanna Arquette) dumps him as a lover, yet stays in his atelier to live. Nolte, from the first scene, portrays a neurotic, 'typical' New York abstract painter, complete with discrete little temper tantrums about deadlines. He seems balanced and normal. But his painting is going nowhere. So he drives to the airport to pick up his girlfriend, and she discloses to him that she is leaving him and going home to her brother. She fell for a stand-up comedian (played by Steve Buschemi - his comedy scene is great because it's bad humour in a stunning setting) but he dumped her the day after. But, this fling flung her out of her comfortable relationship with Lionel (where we get the image that she was never happy anyway) and now she's going home. Lionel stays cooler as you would expect and convinces her to stay with him, no strings attached, for her sake. We believe him, at this stage.Back at the atelier, however, the reality of this new relationship starts to shine through. Paulette doesn't like Lionel very much and has a real identity problem (you get the impression that she paints just because Lionel does), but Lionel appears more and more obsessed - not so much with Paulette herself, but with the company. He percieves Paulette as his property and becomes ragingly jealous when she brings guys home. Paulette, stuck in his atelier, teases him by dressing provocatively and asking him questions like 'Do you love me? - Then prove it by...'. Because of Paulette not being within his grasp, Lionel goes down the tubes. It's not love, in my opinion. It's pride.But, as Lionel's real world fades and collapses, his painting grows and changes and comes to life. The moment his own life with Paulette ends, the life of his painting begins.It's sort of a heavy story in the way that you really have to concentrate and suss out the character's motives. It's not light 'E.R.'-type drama, but it's a lot more fulfilling.And so we are led into 'Life without Zoe', directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It's about a 12-year-old girl and her little life. If Martin Scorsese had stayed in the director's chair for this segment too, we could have had a re-run of 'Taxi Driver', where the 12-year old was a prostitute and the story was rough, but excellent. Instead, the 12-year-old is a rich Vada Sultenfuss, and the story is saccharine and empty. This middle film is destined to be the one people forget. For one thing, there is no narrative drive in the story as far as I can see - there is a robbery which is pretty pointless, there is a rich little boy who has a costume party, and there's the parents. While there are a few charming qualities - that the parents act childishly and their child mothers them; that the costume party is ludicrously lavish to the extent of having violinists and flambeed whatever at the baby's table - this segment is a children's movie. Nothing more, nothing less. Kids would get a kick out of seeing the wealth and possibilites of the kids and the fun of the party, but that's about it. Bad acting is acceptable in children - and abundant here - but it's also present in the adult performances. Some loser says after the robbery 'Wow if I could only hold on to that sense memory I'd be head of my acting class'. You've got a long way to go, buddy...And so it's time for 'Oedipus Wrecks' by Woody Allen. This is the funny one. In fact it's so wonderfully absurd that I won't spoil it by telling you much about it. Only that Woody Allen surprisingly plays a neurotic New Yorker, and this time he is embarrased because his mother is always on his back and bothering him. The development of this story is just so strange and funny that I'll let you find out about it for yourself. It's not Woody at his best, but it's still funny.Altogether, the segments I would rate 7,4,7 giving an average of 6.

I suspect he's right. This comedy about the convulsive relationship between a world-class painter (Nick Nolte) and his young assistant (Rosanne Arquette) is perfect in every detail; the sensibility shaping it seems to be possessed of a limitless power of invention. (It suggests the protean, sensual flights of fancy of late Picasso.) Coppola's segment--LIFE WITHOUT ZOE--written by himself and his daughter Sofia, has a similar, but inverted, distinction it may be the worst movie ever made by a major filmmaker. It may be a measure of its calamity that I don't think I've ever read a review of NEW YORK STORIES that didn't pass over it in silence. Woody Allen's segment, OEDIPUS WRECKS, is a one-joke affair, but it's not a bad joke, and he spins it well. After LIFE LESSONS, though, both are negligible.

"},{"Title":"A generally entertaining, if uneven, film","Date":"30 March 2016","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" An anthology film consisting of three vastly different stories, this is a generally entertaining, if uneven, film. The three segments in question are Life Lessons directed by Martin Scorsese, Life Without Zoe directed by Francis Ford Coppola and Oedipus Wrecks directed by Woody Allen. I will review each segment individually before giving an average.Life LessonsThe most serious of the three, this segment stars Nick Nolte as Lionel Dobie, a middle-aged abstract artist. I have to admit that I have never been particularly enamoured of Nolte. He's perfectly fine but his performance is not exactly outstanding. Consequently, the character does not reach his full potential. Dobie is one of the biggest names on the New York art scene but he is incredibly lonely. The storyline concerns his complicated relationship with his assistant and ex- lover Paulette, played very well by Rosanna Arquette. Paulette is a manipulative character who is only using Dobie to climb the ladder of the art world. While Dobie's recurrent bad relationships with women take a heavy toll on him, they serve as the major source of inspiration for his art. As such, he is essentially going down a path of self-destruction for the sake of his art and I suspect that he will never be happy.In contrast to Coppola and Allen, this is my first exposure to Scorsese's work on the big screen and it would be a major understatement to say that I was impressed. I loved the fact that the camera was in motion for a good 90% of the time as it represented the fact that Dobie is a restless soul. It was filmed in a very naturalistic style and there were many beautiful shots. script by Richard Price is generally very good but I think that he tried to fit a little too much into its 43 minute running time.8/10Life Without ZoeThis segment stars Heather McComb in a simply awful performance as Zoe Montez, a 12-year-old poor little rich girl. Precocious, wise beyond their years children in films can be one of two things charming or insufferable. I'm afraid to say that Zoe is perhaps the most insufferable child character that I have ever come across. The script was written by Coppola and his then 17-year-old daughter Sofia and to say that it is insubstantial would be kind. Zoe's parents, played by Giancarlo Giannini and Talia Shire, are frequently absent. When Zoe learns that her parents are going to reconcile, she is very upset and becomes faint, for some unexplained reason. She later becomes rather taken with the idea. This change of attitude is unexplained. Why bother explaining things? Just let them happen for no logical reason because it says so in the dreadful excuse for a script written by you and your completely inexperienced daughter whom you wanted to indulge.There is also a strand of the plot concerning Zoe returning a precious diamond earring to Princess Soraya. I didn't know how this was relevant to the bits concerning the reconciliation of Zoe's parents. I wasn't alone in that as the Coppolas didn't know either. It is there simply there to serve as padding. In the opening credits, all of the actors and behind the scenes personnel are credited using only their first names, presumably to hide their identities. That was nice of Francis. On the bright side, Giannini is great and the segment is shot competently so it's not an unmitigated disaster. 4/10Oedipus WrecksThe writing and direction of this segment are of Allen's usual high standard. It stars the man himself in an excellent performance as Sheldon Mills, a 50-year-old lawyer who is made to feel like a child whenever he is in the presence of his mother Sadie Millstein. Sheldon has been attending therapy for years and the main topic of conversation in all of his sessions seems to be his dear mother, whom he wishes would simply disappear. Sadie, who is played in an hilarious performance by Mae Questel, frequently tells him that he looks terrible and criticises him for changing his name to the less Jewish sounding Mills. She disapproves of his relationship with his fiancÃ©e Lisa, played very well by Mia Farrow, on the basis that they have only been going out for six months and, more importantly, she is not Jewish.In order that his mother can meet Lisa's three children, Sheldon takes everyone to a magic show. Sadie is invited by Shandu the Magician to come up on stage and help him with his sword trick. The look of utter glee on Sheldon's face when Shandu inserts the swords into the box is hilarious. Things go a bit pear-shaped when Sadie disappears afterwards. However, Sheldon is in for a shock when she appears in the sky and starts sharing all of his most humiliating moments with New York City's millions of inhabitants. Unsurprisingly, this does not do his relationship with Lisa any favours. His psychiatrist recommends that he consult a psychic named Terva, played by Julie Kavner. Eventually, Lisa leaves Sheldon because she can't take it anymore and he falls in love with Terva. They get engaged and Sadie returns to Earth when he introduces her to his new fiancÃ©e, glad that he has finally met a nice Jewish girl. Sadie gets up to her old tricks when she produces the photo album. Sheldon is initially embarrassed but his wince gradually turns to a smile as, in spite of all the humiliation, Sadie is his mother and he thinks the world of her.This is certainly the best of the three segments in the film, partly because Allen appears to have the best understanding of the limits of what can be accomplished in a short film as opposed to a feature film.9/10Overall, that comes to 7/10 "},{"Title":"Good idea but uneven execution","Date":"3 October 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Good idea but uneven execution.The concept three of the greatest movie directors the world has known, Woody Allen, Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola, are each given a 35-40 minute segment to make a mini-movie set in New York. The three segments are not connected in any way. The result is New York Stories.The movie starts with Scorsese's segment, titled Life Lessons. A famous artist, Lionel Dobie (played by Nick Nolte), is in love with the artist he is mentoring, Paulette (played by Rosanna Arquette). However, the feeling is not mutual...Coppola's segment, Life without Zoe, involves a young girl, Zoe (played by Heather McComb) and her privileged-yet-parentless life.Woody Allen's segment, Oedipus Wrecks, completes the movie. A NY lawyer, Sheldon Mills (played by Woody Allen), is constantly being embarrassed by his aging mother. Then one evening he takes her to a magic show and things take a turn for the bizarre...The Scorsese contribution was interesting, with a nice twist at the end. Did seem to in circles occasionally, and didn't move forward at any great pace, but the interactions between the characters was engaging.Coppola's segment was easily the worst of the three. Silly and pointless. It feels like it was made for kids, which, if it was, is starkly out of place with the clearly adult-orientated Scorsese and Allen portions. And even kids will probably find it silly and boring...Woody Allen's piece was the pick of the bunch. It displays Allen's sublimely clever, dry wit plus adds a large dollop of the ridiculous. Very funny at times with a twist that is quite bizarre. Nice- bizarre, though it does border on the silly.7/10s for the Allen and Scorsese portions, 3/10 for Coppola. "},{"Title":"An unconventional love letter to New York","Date":"31 December 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Three of the most important directors of all time unite here to produce a remarkable conjointed project offering an interesting rendition about the modern center of the world, the imponent New York. It offers plenty of visions, transitioning from a realistic urban tale to dreamy and out of the ordinary situations that takes place in a city where everything can and will happen. I guess it's fair to say this was one of the first films of its kind (with the city as main character), specially in American cinema who takes inspiration from many European classics of the 1960's with talented group of directors united for a common project, each with his view. Seeing New York Stories now is ten times more relevant now than what it was right when of its release. We can analyze the filmmakers evolution (the washed-up Coppola tale is more of a Sofia project than one directed by Francis); take a look at a New York distant from 9/11, a fresh, energic and positive place that seemed to open its arms to everyone. Nostalgia takes over.Life Lessons (Martin Scorsese segment) Marty, the only who haven't wrote his own piece, made a small masterpiece with his short film, the longest of the segments. It's a true spinning wheel on the life of a famous painter (Nick Nolte) who welcomes back a estranged girlfriend (Rosanna Arquette), muse of his creations and according to him, love of his troubled life of countless failed marriages. Of all three, this has the most poignant story, and the visual master-craft of Scorsese is an ecstasy to the eyes with Nestor Almendros spectacular cinematography and the always effective editing of Thelma Schoonmaker, both helping to tell a story in a great sense. It tells plenty about relationships, the fragility, in's and out's and everything that comes with it, love vs. interest vs. passion. It's slightly melodramatic but it works.Life Without Zoe (Francis Ford Coppola segment) a rich girl (Heather McComb) lives a perfect life among rich friends and dedicated parents (Talia Shire and Giancarlo Giannini) who are tying to reconcile with each other. Everyhing's so vivid, colorful and so sitcom-like that...nothing happens, really. The most indulgent and careless of the segments, this one seems more like a Sofia Coppola project (and she wrote it when she was 18) than a Francis film. Looking back now that she made tremendous films on similar hedonistic poor rich girl issues but with a little more depth, it only proves that some people can't change all that much. The city is OK here, and there's even time to flee to Greece.Oediphus Wrecks (Woody Allen segment) what can I say? Allen is Allen, always a pleasure to watch. Here, he plays a man who suffers with the constant interference of his mother (Mae Questel, lovely) on his life and relationships until the day she mysteriously disappears during a magic act. Everything's fine, he's spending more time with his girlfriend (Mia Farrow) until the mother pops up in the New York sky, still bothering him but this time for everyone to see and laugh of him. His only hope a psychic (Julie Kavner, brilliant) who'll try everything on her book to make the old lady go away. New York is extensively captured, perhaps the only segment that allowed the viewers to get a real sense of how magnificent the city is - the shot with the mother's floating head over the World Trade Center is beautifully and magically done. Two good tales against one bad, the majority wins. Frankly, I prefer this movie than the current streaming of NY, I Love You, Paris, I Love You (and now Rio will have its movie) that features a larger group of directors but only 4 or 5 can make decent and memorable pieces about those spectacular cities. I'd like to see new takes from the same directors, but this time Spike Lee instead of Coppola, and more focus on the other districts rather than only Manhattan. 10/10 "},{"Title":"New York deserved better ...","Date":"21 May 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" New York Stories are three films from three directors, and not the least of them Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola and Woody Allen. What a premise! And what a disappointment! Maybe there should have been more than the setting to connect the stories; don't we expect a New York story from Allen anyway? They could have been set anywhere else without damaging the overall effect, but the question is why an anthology from the three greatest directors of their generation, sunk so lamentably into oblivion? And I guess the answer is obvious Coppola's segment sucked. And it sucked big time. This is the first time I even use the word in a review, but I think it is for the right film. Scorsese and Allen's segments are no masterpieces, but Life Without Zoe is the worst film ever made by Coppola. In a nutshell, New York Stories failed because of Coppola.Have a quick look on its Wikipedia's page and compare the lengths of the three summaries. It's quite telling that the one in the middle is so thin. While Scorsese and Allen at least intended to tell us stories, you know, with characters, conflicts, with seemingly plots for Cinematic Gods' sake, Life Without Zoe is a lifeless, dull and shockingly thin film, relating in a fairy-tale format the adventures of a rich little girl, with her friends, and one obscure Arab Prince who speaks Oxford' English and still struggle to understand some basic words. Nothing much happens, which is acceptable for a character study or an introspective film, but Life Without Zoe can get away with such alibis. The film illustrates more of Coppola's nepotism (Papa Carmine composed the score, little Sofia wrote it and sister Talia starred in it) than any hint of the immense talent he once had.And Life Lessons is what Life Without Zoe should have been it doesn't have a specific plot either, but it's lively, it doesn't have many characters but each one carries a strong emotional force allowing us to connect with it. It features Nick Nolte as an abstract painter, facing a mental block three weeks before the exhibition of his works, he must finish a giant canvas, certainly what has to become his masterpiece, but somewhere he lost the inspiration. The fuel instantly comes when he invites to his huge studio, Paulette, Rosanna Arquette as his former lover and student. He's obviously infatuated with her while she rejects him because she knows she doesn't get what she wants a true opinion on her talent. The story is a fascinating tale of mental and emotional influences based on the mentor/disciple and lovers' relationships, and it is a visually dazzling film featuring the creative process in its most compelling form.Made of sensual movements of brushes caressing the canvas and more energetic uses of burning colors, we follow Lionel's movements while Scorsese maintains an interesting suspense on the final result. He plunges us into the beauty of art and the way it drains its best inspirations from our inner demons. It looks flashy like The Color of Money but the film borrows more from After Hours (starring Rosanna Arquette too), through the depiction of the artistic New York, a world made of venal interest and sincere passion, where talentless people use sex to fulfills their ambitions, and true artists translate the lack of it into their work. For Lionel, it's a mix of revolt, anger, passion and some rock'n'roll and sixties music highlighting Marty's talent to choose the right music for the right scene. Art fills art, and in forty minutes, Life Lessons stands alone among the highlights of Marty's career.Woody Allens' Oedipus Wrecks is not his riskiest or most revolutionary project, it's a comedy about a banker who can't stand the interferences of his typical Jewish mother, in his personal life and her constant disapproval of all his decisions, why would he marry a blonde woman with three kids from another marriage (Mia Farrow)? Why does he keep whining when she shows his baby pictures to random strangers? Given the film was made after the serious streak of September and Another Woman, it's fun to see Allen getting back to his roots. And the gags work, climaxing with a formidable twist when the mother suddenly disappears after a magical trick (you'd recognize the Zitar theme from The Curse of the Jade Scorpion). The way her disappearance is involved is smart, her reappearance is even more surprising, especially that it introduces Julie Kavner at her most hilarious.What lacked in Oedipus Wrecks though is a satisfying ending; the last three minutes destroy the whole build-up. Surely, a screenplay with such a creative premise could have come up with a better conclusion, but it's like Allen was in a rush to finish the film, and threw away the most artificial and unsatisfying conclusion of his career. Oedipus Wrecks still benefits from the fact that it comes right after the horrendous Life Without Zoe, and I suspect people would love any story coming after the plot less Zoe. I wish Zoe wouldn't have existed if only to leave more room to the other films. I wish he could see Marty and Woody's films and look at Zoe and think What have I done? How can a man so capable of greatness like The Godfather let himself slipping that way? Hell, even his Jack is The Godfather compared to Life Without Zoe. I even wonder if he didn't remove the last names in the opening credits out of shame.I've got to hand it to Scorsese to outshine two great directors and make a truly original piece of art, I wish Allen could make a worthy ending to a very promising comedy. And I simply blame Coppola for having ruined a great project. My advice skip the second segment, start with the third, finish with the first, and it'll be fine.

Finally, kudos to Scorsese for discovering and introducing to the world the very beautiful Brigitte Bako!

It seems to be an exercise in pointlessness - and plotlessness. But it does some have some bright spots newcomer Heather McComb is cute and talented, and Carole Bouquet looks positively heavenly in a 10-second cameo as a princess. I'd rate it *1/2 out of 4.Woody Allen's Oedipus Wrecks (great title, by the way) is possibly his purest comedy - and his funniest film - in a over a decade. Apart from some killer one-liners, Woody acts a lot with his face here - his grin while his mother is being subjected to the magic trick, for example, says a thousand words. He even goes as far as using old-deaf-lady jokes - but they are very funny! The only problem with this segment is that it runs just a tad too long. I'd rate it *** out of 4.

Eager to see it, an interesting collaborative project between three key directors of the New Hollywood movement, I even rushed home from a prior engagement.Three shorts banded together with the unifying setting of New York, New York Stories consists of Life Lessons, Scorsese's tale of the relationship between an artist and his apprentice; Life Without ZoÃ«, Coppola's take on the life of a child of wealthy parents, left to live alone in a luxurious hotel; Oedipus Wrecks, Allen's exploration of mother-son relationships.A distinct danger with films of this sort is in the directorial differences which can vastly disrupt the overall film's flow. Monumental shifts in tone can be quite disconcerting and often do a lot to detract from the effect of the piece as a whole. Lucky, then, that these directors all come from the same period, each counted among the upper echelons of those filmmakers who graduated from the 60s/70s movie brat generation. Not, that is to say, that there is a homogeneity to the shorts&#x97;each offers something distinct in terms of both narrative and tone&#x97;but rather that they are at least of similar minds and sensibilities. Scorsese's contribution is perhaps the most interesting of the three, a look at the artist culture that is so key to the New York of fiction. Nolte's artist is a classic tortured soul, channelling his torment into his canvas and creating a work that evolves and develops just as he fails to do so, trapped in a cycle of depression and dependency. Intelligently structured and driven by character depth, Life Lessons is a very solid start. Coppola's follows, showing us the life of the wealthy and privileged and seeming to comment upon the laissez-faire parenthood of the rich which develops their children so early into adulthood. What sounds an interesting idea with room for probing into a social issue turns into a ridiculous story of princesses and parties, set in a fairytale world complete with a happy family ending. It drags, it sags, and it asks us to fall in love with hideously uninteresting characters. Life Without ZoÃ« is an appropriate title for what the audience will come to desire by the time it all ends. No thank you Francis, get off the stage. When he does, at last, it is Allen's turn. Having never before experienced the supposed wonders of Allen's comedic efforts, Oedipus Wrecks was the most highly anticipated of the three for me, and brought some very welcome laughs into the mix. Fantastic situational humour coupled with Allen's sublime comedic timing quickly steered it toward becoming the best of the bunch. It takes a rather disappointing bad turn along the way, but still maintains enough of a laugh factor to keep it from sinking. Not masterful, but quite, quite funny, and with a nice dash of comment on the issue at hand.The kind of idea that's interesting to see played out, New York Stories is neither as bad as its worst nor as good as its best. The Scorsese and the Allen each make for entertaining viewing, the former more substantial in its thematic depth, the latter more immediately thrilling in its hilarity. The Coppola pulls the standard down a stretch, really testing audience patience between the two infinitely better pieces. Much more three shorts banded together than a feature film, it's worth watching, but only just.

Sounds good? Sadly, it isn't.Things start off with Life Lessons by Martin Scorsese, a story that starts off a little unremarkably but that blossoms into something really quite great. Nick Nolte is the passionate artist and Rosanna Arquette is the girl he smothers while trying to keep as his muse. And, hey, it also has Steve Buscemi and Illeana Douglas so that's a plus.Then we get Life Without Zoe by Francis Ford Coppola, a piece of schmaltzy, cinematic excrement so bad that I don't even want to talk about it. It pretty much ruins the entire movie, sitting there in the middle section stinking the place up. The only high point of this tale was seeing the wonderful Talia Shire on screen again. I can't say any more, just thinking about it makes me nauseous.We end with the great Oedipus Wrecks by Woody Allen, a story about a man (Allen, unsurprisingly) who finds his life turned into an absolute nightmare when a stage magician makes his mother disappear only for her to appear as a giant, talkative presence in the sky, still embarrassing her son with her constant nagging and comments but now doing so on a much grander scale as everyone else in the city can hear her too. With Mia Farrow and Julie Kaver also in this section, the movie at least ends on a high note.Scorsese and Allen play to their known style and their segments will satisfy fans of the directors. Coppola? I have no idea what he was thinking of. Perhaps this was a way to forewarn people about a future that would include the movie Jack, I honestly have no idea why the man would choose to sandwich such a piece of tripe in between two superior tales.If you have to watch the whole thing once then do so but for future viewings I recommend scheduling some task to be done during that godawful middle section. "},{"Title":"A STRONG DISSENT - Please look again at Life Without Zoe","Date":"31 May 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" There has been arguably the strongest outpouring of negative commentary in IMDb ever seen about the supposedly little afterthought of the New York Storiues triad - Life without Zoe. Could I at least ask a reconsideration? This dear, tender piece, created as a light bon-bon, shows through the magical/real prism of the young eyes that (Ihope that) you all experienced looking at the world as a child. One object or friend takes one's fancy for some reason for a little while, then another. Pace and cinematic tempo must reflect that which may look a mish-mash to adult viewer's eyes.The film basically just follows a bright, attentive young girl's life over a number of days,events being magnified or diminished just as they are as a girl records her diary highlights, or tells you the essential summary of what happened at school at the end of a day when you pick them up to take home. Seeing a drunk in the street may loom large, or the latest hip item of local kids clothing to be seen in.Many of these daily events don't necessarily have a further deep meaning, a filmistic solution or termination--the half-sculpted and wonky images of a day's life just end hanging,(or disappearing) into thin air.Matt Groening recently commented (admiitedly speaking about the different genre of adult comedy)in a UK interview that he felt that US audiences needed to be hit with a sledgehammer to produce an adequate comic effect and he would sometimes love to produce comedy with the subtlety acceptable to overseas audiences. I don't want to inflame any transatlantic passions, but is it possible that US audiences are just not able to handle stories such as the running of a child's mind that doesn't necessarily have a beginning, a middle, or an end? What if you just sat in the film and took in the experience---no punchline, only feeling and seeing...But young girls have bigger dreams and special loves---and there is (for many) nothing more special than the daughter's adoration, showoffiness,and special love for---their FATHER. It may extend to magnification of Dad to almost superhuman proportions---in this case, Dad is a classical flautist, and the dreaminess about her suave, charming, European, traveled father creates a delightful loving giant edifice of her father in her eyes, who creates special flute wandering leitmotifs to lull her to sleep, and informs her life with love. In reality, there is no fluff in here at all. I became (blessedly) a father to identical girl twins well after seeing this movie--and the relationship I have with my girls was perhaps more accurately portrayed here than in any other resonance or description I've encountered. The special tenderness of love for a father's daughter, and when young, this special inexplicable bond, mutually returned, is beyond 25 words or less--but Coppola has sensed this, no doubt especially helping to create this reciprocal magic by employing Sofia in the filmic role of the daughter--at this age and stage of Zoe's tender life, although her early cinematic ability is undoubted and has since been proved, I would judge being employed firstly as being the real daughter and distant secondly, as an actress.And in my view, he and she have both sensed this, and made a good filmic depiction of it. There is great depth of love mingled with total child's whimsy-quite a tough mix to encompass in a film short.Although I hinted this paediatric Ulysses (a day in the life of...little girl X), as a child thinks, doesn't have beginnings, middles or ends, the adoration of young Zoe, mingled with all her other dreams, is crafted into an aesthetically stunning (?how real?) climax of her father's achievement as a musician when he is lead flautist at an orchestral performance in the open air at the foot of the Acropolis, commencing at dusk---just one of these stunning, life lasting images that Coppola has this ability to produce. Perfectly timed, with kids in the select audience, father stands up and plays--and the repertoire drifts as thrilled Sofia's mind hears him playing(at least to her ears)---the special children's music he plays to her when they are together putting her to sleep---my memory may be wrong, but I think it is is a rearrangement into multiple rather simple chord inversions and hence variations of 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star'---but to Sofia, it is a classical triumph- a peak moment in a girl's pride in her father and an orchestral triumph of course of the highest order.

Great camera work.  One particular scene is where Nolte's art agent visits him in his awesome loft studio and is about to leave in the elevator. It's an old elevator with hand operated sliding cage doors.  The camera shoots from inside the small elevator through the bars, making Nolte look like he is a prisoner in his huge studio.  The agent is hounding Nolte to create art which he seems to have trouble because of his distraction(Arquette). Another great scene involves Nolte triumphantly painting his masterpiece to validate himself as Arquette and her lover walk down into the studio. Great music score.

It just feels like it was written, shot and edited in one day.  The segment depicts some poignant aspects of N.Y. city life and possible communication distortions between artists in a fairly effective way.  BTW, notice Deborah Harry's cameo appearance?The second segment, interestingly shot by Vittorio Storaro (il Conformista, Apocalypse now) directed by Francis Ford Coppola (Apocalypse now, the Godfather) should have been edited out entirely, because it is a lousy idea that could have been nice, but is terribly acted, moralistic and vapid at once.  One of Coppola's mistakes unfortunately.  Storaro's work is definitely satisfying though.The third short (cinematographer Sven Nykvist (Fanny och Alexander, Persona), director Woody Allen (Annie Hall, Manhattan)) is the best and most fun with a surreal key element that must be a brilliant metaphor and recognizable for many people (guys?).  Allen really must have touched an old wound writing this story and putting it on celluloid.This movie could never equal Boccaccio '70 (Fellini, Visconti, De Sica, 1962, WITH great music) in any way, but is an okay triptych without a common denominator apart from The City where it all happens and lame music.

(10) Unfortunately, the stories that follow are not up to par.  Francis Ford Coppola's Life without Zoe is probably the weakest of them all.  Told from the children's point of view, it deals with Zoe, a rich and spoiled girl and her school friends as she tries to bring a jewel back to her owner, saving his father from disgrace.  Cannot help but think that this short would have been made much more interesting if Zoe's father had actually cheated on Zoe's mother and the girl realized it.  As all of Coppola's films, you can always see the money on the screen. (4) Finally, Oedipus Wrecks is a typical Woody Allen film, shortened, which packs much more impact.  Woody is Woody as usual, and his problem now is mostly with his Jewish mother and his fiancees.  As in all his films, you'll find psychoanalysis scenes, allusions to his religion, and self-esteem issues.  Funny for moments, it lacks a little bit of coherence in the surreal element, which is used only as a device to create laughs and finish the story.

I very much liked the segment by Scorsese, Life Lessons. Scorsese as in many of his other films captures the pulse of New York. Also as he has explored obsession in previous works his comment on narrow interests and self centerdness is very biting here.Coppola's film is very light. It seems Francis was tired from the profound comments of the Godfather films and Apocalypse Now and just wanted to do a bit of fluff.Allen's part is his best comedy since Annie Hall. It flows naturally without his recent bitterness.IMDB's short comment on this film mentions that Francis Coppola's segment is a bit Felliniesque. Fellini's range is so broad and his influence on these 3 film makers is so deep that there are references to Fellini throughout New York Stories. The most direct borrowing is done by Woody Allen who I've always felt was as much influenced by Fellini as Ingmar Bergman.  Fellini did a short film with two other film makers in a collection called Boccaccio 70 (1969). Fellini uses a gimmick for his short comedy and Allen uses exactly the same one.Of the handful of short film collections I have seen, New York Stories (especially the Scorsese & Allen segments) is the only one that draws me back for more.

I really like all three segments for different reasons. While they are three very different types of stories they are each representative of a different aspect of New York. The diversity of the three segments is a perfect compliment to a city that is so many different worlds all in one place.The first segment directed by Scorsese is a wonderful little vignette about an extremely dysfunctional and destructive relationship between an egomaniacal artist and a young woman in the throws of an identity crisis. They are both using each other and at the same time feeding off each others emotions. Anyone who has been in a relationship with any of these dynamics will appreciate this piece. Nick Nolte and Rosanna Arquette are both superb in their rolls. I think it is a great romanticized portrayal of the New York art scene of the late 70's - early 80's. I also really enjoyed all the music in this segment.I am amazed at how many people panned the Coppola segment. It is an adorable piece. This is a real tribute to the boundless imagination of a child. It could truly be a real story or it could be the fairy tale world of a child in a totally different circumstance, or anything in between. For all we know, ZoÃ«'s father could be the street musician. In a city like New York anything is possible. At least this was the way I interpreted the story.The Woody Allen segment definitely showcased Woody at the top of his form. A very funny short film that I will always treasure. It will always remind me of my own mother, who, even though she is not Jewish thinks she is. Besides the great play on Freudian psychology I also loved the way the city just accepts the bizarre situation. I also love Allen's take on the human desire to explore any avenue to try to come to terms with the strangeness in life.So, there you have it, three unique stories by three master story tellers. Each one giving the viewer a little taste of a different world within a world. The huge range of experiences and possibilities are what makes New York one of the great cities of the world, if not the greatest. For those who didn't care for one segment or another, I urge you to spend a little time in the city doing a variety of things. Go to the symphony, take in a museum, eat a hot dog on the street corner, take a walk in the park, talk to bum on the street, listen to some street musicians, hang out in Chinatown or Little Italy on a Sunday afternoon. Then, go back and watch the movie again. I believe you may see it in a little different light.

In common, they have a passion for the city which they have chosen as a backdrop to their shorts. Now let's get to the business if you're expecting the best of the best selection that could come out of this pack of directors, forget it. Because this was no pretentious project, but a way to express the love the directors have for New York and the people who live there. The inevitable mixed review follows1. Life's Lessons, by Scorsese. A typical Scorsese movie, with a way of filming and characters which resemble their art painting. Here, like the main credits, we get the stories and the reactions like slobs of paint, apparently thrown at random but with an intentional instinct behind them. Nick Nolte tries to be different for a change, and suceeds. Rosanna Arquette still looks like Marcy from After Hours, but struggles to snap out of it.2. Life without Zoe, by Coppola. Complete with the trademark beautiful cinematography by Vittorio Storaro, this segment comes out as maybe the most trivial of the three, but it is still a sweet tale of how a child has to become a grown up before time, forced by the circunstances which surround them. This segment can be placed between the section of the flops and the section of the victories by director Coppola, which is one of the most unstable directors known. 3. Oedipus Wrecks, by Allen. Here, I have to take my hat off. Because this is a proof that Woody Allen always delivers when we expect something from him. This hilarious segment will make seeing the movie all worth it, and I will not spoil it so that those who see it can have the most fun with it possible. I just can say that this is a wonderful pearl, and you can expect the usual high-quality Woody Allen fare. Altogether, I think that after seeing this one few of our lives will be changed, but one will also feel that they gained something from the experience. Anyway, give it a go.

However, I hadn't been aware that a teenage Adrien Brody was supposed to be in it until I happened to look up his credits on the IMDb. Since he was listed in order of appearance as part of the cast of Coppola's segment LIFE WITHOUT ZOÃ, I kept a sharp eye out for young Brody in the school cafeteria scene -- at least it *looked* like it was supposed to be the cafeteria! The artistically dim lighting made things a little hard to see, which may be why I (and other Brody fans I know) could hardly find Brody at all. Judging by the order in which he's listed in the credits (as a character named Mel), Brody should've shown up in ZoÃ«'s school right after the know-it-all character Andrea (Alexandra Becker) shows up, just before the Sherry-Netherland robbery scene with Chris Elliott. Brody must have had dialogue at some point, or he wouldn't have been in the credits at all. However, I guess Coppola & Company pulled a THIN RED LINE on the adolescent Adrien, because I didn't see or hear him utter a single syllable. My only inkling that Boy Brody was in the scene at all was that when I looked very closely and pressed my DVD remote's Slow button, I thought I detected a familiar noble-nosed profile amongst the students stylishly silhouetted in the background. Oh, well, at least Brody got an early screen credit and presumably a paycheck out of the experience, as did another future Oscar-winner Sofia Coppola, who co-wrote the script and designed the cute opening credit sequence. Nevertheless, I found LIFE WITHOUT ZOÃ entertaining even when the game of Spot the Adrien came a cropper, despite its reputation as the weakest of NYS's trio of vignettes. While it has its overly precious moments, it's basically an uncredited 'tween update of Kay Thompson's ELOISE AT THE PLAZA book series, one of my faves; think of this as ZOÃ AT THE SHERRY-NETHERLAND. With gorgeous New York locations, catchy songs by Kid Creole & the Coconuts, and a likable cast including young Heather McComb, Don Novello, Giancarlo Giannini, and Talia Shire, you could find worse ways to pass the time. As for the other entries, Scorsese's LIFE LESSONS, with a screenplay by Richard Price, is well-crafted and well-acted, though the temperamental, manipulative artist and assistant/muse/lover played, respectively, by Nick Nolte and Rosanna Arquette were so immature and strident they got on my nerves after a while. Hands down, my favorite of the 3 vignettes (and the fave of most folks who've seen NYS) was Allen's uproarious OEDIPUS WRECKS, the story of a Jewish mother (Mae Questel, the cutie who voiced Betty Boop and Olive Oyl, is a devious delight) whose well-meant domination of her henpecked son (Allen) gets out of hand when the audience participation portion of a magic show goes horribly yet hilariously awry. Mia Farrow and Julie Kavner provide able support; CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM fans should keep an eye out for Larry David in a brief bit as the magic show theater manager.

Nolte put in a good performance, but the storyline didn't seem to go anywhere. The next short from Coppola was terrible. It followed a young girl who had rich parents and seemed to live by herself most of the time because of there busy work commitments.

Scorsese's direction is no more stylish than the efforts of his companions, but there's more substance in this one episode than in both others combined. Francis Ford Coppola's 'Life Without ZoÃ«' is a fizzy, uptown urban fairy tale told from the point of view of a precocious, sophisticated 12-year old heiress, and Woody Allen's amusing, typically neurotic 'Oedipus Wrecks' is reminiscent of one of his New Yorker essays, perhaps better suited to the printed page.

There's basically no reason to make this one entire film in the first place---other than the running theme of privileged people acting like selfish idiots. Scorsese handles the tortured art world, Coppola takes the ritzy world of music, and Woody's got law. They direct in their own distinct style and the tonal shift is jarring each time. The experiment fails.Scorsese leads off. Nick Nolte is a superstar painter going through a serious midlife crisis. Young fling Rosanna Arquette is trying to break free of him once & for all, although he's more sympathetic than she is (even if he's got that obsessive neediness that successful artists tend to have). Then it's on to Coppola's segment of a poor, little, rich girl named Zoe (Heather McComb). Her parents are always away (dad is a mega-flutist) and she's living in a swanky NY hotel with only a butler as company. Next, bring on the angst! Woody Allen plays a lawyer who has to tolerate his oppressive Jewish mother. When she goes missing, his life improves immediately, only to slump again when his guilt manifests into her loud-mouthed apparition towering over the city.All of this plays like deleted scenes from better movies. It's very weak by their standards, but Scorsese's piece (the longest one) has the most life and Woody sniffs around the fringes of some of his trademark suffering yuppie stuff. Coppola, though, is wasting his time & talent. His daughter, Sofia, co-wrote his seg with him and you can bet she could relate to Zoe's life. But, apparently, REGULAR life is something these 3 giants of the industry know nothing about anymore. I'm still scratching my head as to why they couldn't have done something clever to tie it all up.

He is only good in roles where his emotional capabilities don't go beyond facial expressions yet here he is a deeply emotional guy who's in love. The story-plain simple nothing special Francis Ford Coppola-Incredbly lame story, the title kind of puzzles me. Annoying kids living posh lives, some kwazi romance in between and that's about it. It felt like living in an 8 year old's body and watching kids movies on Saturday morning or something. Except this time I'm not eight anymore. When you miss my man, you hit rock bottom Woody Allen-Actually had potential of a really intriguing story. The second half ruins it completely. Annoying old Jewish lady...Final verdict-I'll try to forget about this junk as quickly as possible, it doesn't deserve to take up space in my already small head.

The directors are well known and this is the motivation I watched it but I think they did it for hobby, not for work (except Coppola). Scorsese's part is a predictable bore. What is more obvious than a painter in NYC? ClichÃ©. The music is the best of Scorsese's choice. Maybe Whiter shade of pale is the actual plot. Allen's story is very dumb in my humbly opinion. A funny idea but he didn't need to put that big mama in the sky. Thes best one is Copolla's Life without Zoe (Zoe means life in Greek). A poor rich little girl left on her own in in a city like that! Through her eyes we can watch a magical NYC, full of bunny-rabbits and princess from the 1001 nights. This is why I love this city.

When it comes to these type of movies they're always uneven simply because you have different styles and so forth but I always ask myself if any of the shorts are good enough to where you'd want to see them expanded into features and in the case here only the first film would be worthy. Even though all three films open with credits that tell you who directed them, anyone familiar with their work would be able to tell even without the credits.Martin Scorsese's Life Lessons features an artist (Nick Nolte) struggling to find his painting in time for his big release party but while trying to finish up he's also struggling to find a connection with his assistant (Rosanna Arquette) who he has been having a sexual affair with. This here is without question the best of the three films because you have a fairly interesting story that is perfectly directed. I really loved the way that Scorsese never really explains what the story is and instead he just gives us little pieces and hints as the film moves along. It also doesn't hurt that you've got Nolte giving a terrific performance as he doesn't have to say much but you can see everything in his face. Arquette is also very good in her role as is Steve Buscemi in his brief part. The real star here however is editor Thelma Shoonmaker who does some of her greatest work here. This is especially true during the painting sequences, which are just downright beautifully filmed and the way they are edited is just something masterful to watch.Francis Ford Coppola's Life Without Zoe is the worst of the bunch and centers on a lonely 12-year-old girl (Heather McComb) who doesn't have any real friends until one day she meets the richest boy in school who is also friendless. I've seen this film a few times now and I keep hoping that it eventually makes sense but it never does. This is a pretty bad movie on so many levels but the majority of the blame has to go to Coppola because the story makes very little sense and his direction is so lifeless that you really wonder if even he cared about what was going on. Right from the start it's just impossible to get caught up in the story, the characters or to really care about anything that's going on. McComb gives a very good performance in the lead and Talia Shire isn't too bad as her mother but the film on the whole is just bad.Woody Allen's Oedipus Wrecks) features Allen playing a 50-year-old lawyer who still can't get away from his mother. One day he introduces his mother to his fiancÃ© (Mia Farrow) and the three take her kids to a magic act where the mother mysteriously disappears. A few days later she re-appears over the skies of New York City where she starts telling all of her son's secrets and embarrassing him even more. I think this third film has a few interesting moments and it has a rather clever idea but in the end it just never fully comes together. I never thought any of the embarrassing stories that the mother tells were all that funny and I'd say more than anything they're just annoying. Even Allen, the actor, doesn't appear to be at the top of his game as this character is just something that feels tiresome. Farrow isn't much better as she just sleepwalks through her part.NEW YORK STORIES, in the end, is a pretty disappointing affair with only Scorsese's film really coming to life and being something worthy. The Coppola short is one of the worst things he's ever done and the Allen film isn't too bad but it's just rather lifeless compared to the director's other films. "}]
