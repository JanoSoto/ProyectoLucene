They are surrounded by some of the best character actors working today, including Rip Torn.

I just have to figure the commenters are a bunch of Yankees who never set foot in the South and have no feel for the slow, quiet humor that this fine film represents.But even that cultural adjustment doesn't explain the complete failure of these other reviewers to appreciate a really finely drawn comedy, from beginning to end. This is a wonderful work by the fine writer and director Robert Benton, who defies the axiom, Comedy is hard. He makes it look easy.What he did was simple, looking back, but so very hard for most people to do He set up a funny plot and kept it funny from one scene to another, by keeping it low key and letting the characters carry the humor lightly, one slightly ridiculous moment after the other, thus avoiding the great comedic danger You can kill comedy by overworking it.Benton takes a plausible story about some Texas corruption and discovered maps with some amusing twists to it and jacks it up with some great dialogue and some fine actors -- mostly Southern, as it happens the fine actor Rip Torn (birth name, Ripley J. Torn, Jr., Texas) and Kim Basinger (Alabama). Robert Benton himself is from Waxahatchie, Texas, and wrote the screenplay with full knowledge and confidence of the plausibility of the plot and the reality of his characters.Folks, I know lots of people like these characters. So do you. Good people, simple people, women who on the phone who soon ask, How's yer Mom 'n 'em? And Benton has given them a moment of great adventure and humor.A few gems Jeff Bridges I'm not in the Vernon Darlin' business anymore. Basinger naming her early fetus Doris Isabel and talking to her. Rip Torn Why is it you work your butt off all your life to get ahead and it takes two nitwits about ten minutes to screw the whole thing up. And in her most glorious beauty, Glenne Headley as the girlfriend, full of Texas spunk.I truly pity the Yankees and Californians west of Bakersfield who cannot see the beauty of this film.

The chemistry between her and Jeff Bridges is  like TNT and drives the film forward, and the added comic bluster of Rip Torn as the villain (and the clever script and direction by veteran Robert Benton) makes this a comic gem in the true tradition of the 1930s screwball comedies, but updated for the 1980s.

I think it was because it was set in another era. But I happen to think this is one of those movies that once you've seen it, it stays with you. The plot is predictable, the action is a little on the slow side, and it veers off funny a few times. However, that being said, Kim Basinger single handedly MAKES this movie. Don't get me wrong Jeff Bridges does a great job too, but it's Nadine that gives the movie it's spark and it's wittiest moments. Basinger is picture perfect because YES, she is beautiful, but she REALLy inhabits the dialogue and her character. She acts beautifully and really seems to be having a great time. My favorite two scenes are when Vernon and Nadine are driving to the photography studio and later when they are alone in his trailer. The scene in the car is all about dialogue and establishing who these two are to each other and it's done amazingly well in a short time. Basinger's dialect alone will make you laugh. I don't know Vernon, she look a little on the chubby side to be Pecan Queen and You know me Vernon, they don't bother me, I don't bother them. She's referring to her spark plugs. I don't know why, but I LOVE her in this scene. It's just seems effortless. And the scene in his trailer, where they are too close for comfort and it starts rekindling that old flame. Chemistry is amazing in this scene, like they can barely exist near each other.I highly recommend watching this some night, where you don't have to be up doing laundry or dusting your knick knacks. Pop some popcorn and give this one a chance.

I found it highly entertaining.Kim Basinger is Nadine, a pregnant, soon to be divorced woman living in small-town Texas in 1954. She posed for some art studies and wants to get them back from the sleazy photographer (Jerry Stiller) who told her that he knew Hugh Hefner. She's very insistent, so he lets her into his studio, even though he has an appointment coming, and sticks her in the back room. When he opens the door with what seems to be her file, he falls over, dead from a knife in the back. Nadine grabs her file and gets out of there. When she arrives home, the file has maps of an area of town in it. She lies to her ex-husband (Jeff Bridges) so that he will return to the studio with her; soon, they're on the run from the police - and the owner of the maps (Rip Torn).This is a funny, fast-moving comedy with excellent performances from Bridges, Basinger, Torn, Stiller, Glenne Headley as Bridges' girlfriend, and Gwen Verdon, who plays Nadine's boss. Written and directed by Robert Benton, Nadine is a small film and an enjoyable one. Recommended.

What do you mean it isn't funny? Seeing those two muscle headed wrestlers climbing on that furniture, how about the rattlesnakes on the floor, or don't move or you can say good-bye to your private parts? For the detractors, please the movie is about the relationship of these two. I am a philosopher, not exactly an expert on romance, but there is appreciable chemistry with these two. Benton is a gifted writer he wrote Nobody's Fool and the underrated Still Of The Night. Here, there is consistently witty repartee with the exasperated Nadine dealing with stubborn as a mule Vernon. The scene after they escape the cops and Nadine looks over wordlessly in a loving glance at Vernon, with the music in the background, well, that's the point. It is a love story more than a comedy; a remarkably understated one with great dialog that is funny. My mama never remembers ever laying eyes on your daddy, you didn't laugh at that? The theme besides the romance is summed up by Buford at the end,You know you plan something all out your whole life and it takes two idiots ten minutes to wreck the whole thing.It is like a comedy Blood Simple these two sweet idiots just are pieces of fate that lay waste Buford's beautifully worked out get rich plan. The comedy comes from the Acorn Queen and the two idiot wrestlers who, believe me, you do not want to hire as protection. Benton's dialog is consistently witty, the romance is very subtle not with full orchestras behind them. I know it was a huge bomb and I am in the minority here but so what? Their affection for each other is almost reluctant and both of them deeply wish it wasn't so. The comedy, like the romance, consists of their drawing together facing death at the end, which would have happened if Floyd wasn't so retarded. Like a comic Blood Simple, as Lauren intones at the beginning, you can work everything all out perfectly and life has a way of just wrecking your plans. Here, these two lovable nitwits are like bulldozers over the top of Buford. Bridges plays a very convincing idiot, which I admired; not every actor wishes to take a role this embarrassing. Basinger never looked more gorgeous than she does here. Is this the funniest movie ever made? No. Is it a cute, sweet very well written romantic comedy that is addictive? Yes. Look, what the majority enjoys, the last twenty years, is not exactly cerebral. Frankly, I do not think this movie is the problem; the intellectual level of comic book movie viewers simply cannot stand more than five minutes without an explosion of some kind. It still is a sweet, cute, funny movie with great warmth about it.

Obviously they're made for each other. Meanwhile, her sleazo photographer turns up dead and they're on the run. It's delightful madcap as they bumble their way through a series of misadventures. Their subtly affectionate sniping reminds me of a bad grammar version of Nick and Nora Charles in the uptown Thin Man series. Surprisingly, the California born Bridges has the good ol' boy drawl down pat, while even the usually snooty Basinger manages a convincing honky-tonk queen. Good period detail without the distractive sounds of Golden Oldies. -- With a delightfully arch Rip Torn as the slyly superior villain.

Jeff Brides plays her estranged husband Vernon Hightower who owns a bar in Austin, Texas circa 1954 that is not doing much in the way of business. He is one of those guys who dream of making it big financially in business as a proof of his manhood, a guy who has always just gotten by on his good looks, a guy who often lies and cuts corners and can't be trusted, but a guy with a smile to charm a rattlesnake. These two really love each other but are currently in the process of getting divorced and Vernon has a girl friend (Renee, played with eager finesse by Glenne Headly) that he wants to marry, he thinks.The plot begins with Nadine going to a photographer's studio and demanding to get back some art studio shots of her that were taken under the guise of being shown to Hugh Hefner at Playboy. The photographer is murdered and Nadine mistakenly ends up with some photos of the plans for the new Interstate that will be built nearby, plans that Buford Pope (Rip Torn) and his thugs want for themselves because, if you know where the highway will be built you can buy up the property near it on the cheap and then sell it later for a big profit. Vernon knows this too and when he finds the photos in Nadine's purse, he takes off with them.The questions that the plot will answer are (1) Will Vernon and Nadine escape from Buford Pope and his strongmen with the photos and their lives? and (2) Will Vernon and Nadine realize they really love each other and find true love and happiness together? There is a shoot-out in a junkyard near the end that's...different, and there's a neat car chase and...well, the movie that started out so well deteriorates into something ordinary, but not all that bad.Robert Benton, who wrote the script for Bonnie and Clyde (1967) and both wrote and directed Kramer vs. Kramer (1979) directed. He has a fine feel for character and can write authentic and witty dialogue. He is not at his best here; nonetheless this is definitely worth seeing mainly because Bridges and Basinger do such a great job of filling up the screen. Basinger in particular is wonderful.

But when one watches this now, one must see it in a different light. It's far from being bad. It's very cool actually. Take two attractive actors, make them as an unusual pair in between loving and hating each other, trying to survive dangerous people and thrilling situations, then you have a movie. And quite a short one (78 minutes). What prevents Nadine of being found good by viewers relates in seeing who's involved in it and why they're stuck with such a heavily clichéd, flawed picture. Why Jeff Bridges and Kim Basinger would star in something like this, playing loud, talky, cheap characters who try to be smarter than smartness itself? Or why Academy Award winner Robert Benton would go forward in writing and directing such a strange project? The conclusion reached was that this was a way of doing something fun, a child's play. Hollywood indulging itself with plenty of fun in the making and hoping people notice that and perhaps enjoy it for what it is. In this department, as being a fun work, it succeeds despite the pros and cons. Today it's easier to make things like this and with better results (Ocean's Eleven is a living proof of this, a movie made among friends, very easy and it became quite profitable, going with two more sequels). How come no one notices that in this film? It's not trying to convey messages or have a higher purpose, it's just a small entertainment, fine. It's the kind of story presented time and time again in countless pictures Nadine (Basinger) testifies a murder, then she gets chased by people involved in it who want something she might have taken out from the victim, something that belongs to them. Endangered and with nothing better to do, she contacts her soon to be ex-husband (Bridges), a lousy bar owner drowned in debts and misunderstandings, who's desperately for divorcing his wife to marry his new girl (Glenne Headly) as fast as possible. Fun thing about this is seeing the story made in the 1950's, for whatever reasons. Basinger and Bridges make a very exciting couple, they're pretty good together. Hearing their accents might be a problem to many, I think it's quite hilarious at parts. Not much of an intelligent, brilliantly written comedy, it just goes in presenting goofy situations and bright action sequences (final shootout is the best and also the bit with the snakes in the room). Final analysis it never gets great as it could be and even gets weary in such short running time but it's an amusing film, well acted by everyone involved, and with a nice soundtrack.
