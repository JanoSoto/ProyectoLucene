The story was a nice one, too, with no complaints about inappropriate language or behavior.Kevin Kline supplies many of the laughs, at least with me. I preferred him over John Lithgow or Jim Broadbent.This is supposedly based on a true story but I am going to assume they took a lot of liberties with it. Nonetheless, it's a story and a decent for the whole family, as the clich√© goes. However, I think this is mostly appealing to females. I found it pleasant, but more of a chick flick than a guy's film. Thus, I doubt I would watch it again, especially knowing the surprise ending.I definitely recommend this comedy-drama-romance for people who haven't seen it, and for most people who are not adult males.

A mysterious girl who apparently speaks no English is found begging in the streets.  The magistrate wants to put her in jail, but the wife of one of the prominent men of the city wants to take her home to stay with her.  Several people are consulted to determine what language the girl speaks, including one language expert played by John Lithgow who is very funny (especially when he tries to speak various languages).  The girl doesn't look Asian or Middle Eastern, but if she's faking it (as some suspect) she's doing a good job.  She has a tattoo and strange religious customs that provide clues, though the language in which she writes is not known to anyone. It is decided that she is speaking a dialect from Asia. When she does understand what is going on, she comes across as quite charming.  Eventually, it is determined that she must be a princess, and her name seems to be Caraboo.Phoebe Cates gave a performance worthy of an Oscar nomination.  Whether her character did as well I won't say.  You'll just have to watch.I was worried when the movie wasn't funny at first, but the humor came in large doses after a while, and not the usual type of movie humor.  This was quite a sophisticated film considering it often tried to be silly, and the costumes and the settings were very nice.  The music was magnificent, whether highbrow classical or period music that sounded more like what ordinary people would enjoy.   Everything about this movie was well done, and while it's not normally the type of movie I would watch, I enjoyed it.

See it!","Date":"22 February 2004","Score":"13 out of 14 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, History","Review":"  Princess Caraboo is a rare breed of film these days -- aimed at adults, but highly respectful of the human soul and therefore safe for all ages.  All viewers should find the historical angle fascinating, lovers of whimsical, offbeat humor will be delighted, romantics will be stirred by the powerful ending...and the ravishing color palette of the sets and costumes will enchant those who crave sheer visual beauty.I personally thought the wonderful ending was handled very well -- it was particularly powerful for being beautifully understated, and did not take away from the effectiveness of the story.  Because it had been foreshadowed (with great subtlety) throughout the movie, it did not arrive as a shock but rather as a fulfillment.I must also put in a good word for the glorious music...another home run.  See this film.  As others have noted, it will stay with you long afterward. "},{"Title":"For those who love a story","Date":"30 July 2004","Score":"12 out of 14 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, History","Review":"  Princess Caraboo is about the selfish and fashionable endeavors of the aristocracy of 19th century England, about the role of true charity and from whence it comes, and perhaps most of all it is about humankind's fascination with the story. Although we catch glimpses of, and come to care for, the true character of Caraboo (Cates), the movie's namesake serves mainly as a vessel through which the subject of the film can flow. In this movie a young beggar who speaks no English is taken in by a well-to-do family, and before long they have determined that she is a queen of the Orient. In no time, she is the town's sensation, and if nothing else, living like royalty. Her story attracts the attention of a newspaper man (Mr. Gutch played by Stephen Rea) who, in determinedly trying to discover the truth about Caraboo, falls in love with her. He half hopes the legend is true, half hopes that she's remarkable enough to have made up a story and a language and a manner to fool the very class she'd always been taught to fear and respect.I liked this movie for many reasons. It must be said that it's decidedly predictable, but such is the case in movies that are not so much concerned with plot as with characters. The question is, are the characters worth making a movie about? They are. Cates is delightful as always, and in such a role in which she scarcely speaks, she has the opportunity to shine and to demonstrate (through action and manner) her ability to act the part. Stephen Rea is never to be outdone, and has a genuine ability to pull off passion in whatever role he plays. The British aristocracy is portrayed as largely grotesque and corrupt and mind-numbingly self-absorbed.For my part, I always appreciate a movie that doesn't revolve around romance, and though this movie is touched with pieces of romanticism (definitely a chick-flick in certain ways), it's not about the romance. It is instead about how the story completes us, and how compelling the human imagination really is. Despite the moral values the film purports, Princess Caraboo is not didactic and short on sappiness. I think Princess Caraboo is a delightful and beautiful tale, and I recommend it to those who prefer the story to the action, and who like to see the rich get theirs.

Phoebe Cates is charming, and the character actors (notably Kevin Kline and Jim Broadbent) are all splendid fun; plus there's excellent cinematography from Freddie Francis.SPOILER ALERT The film is based on a true story, in which early in the 19th century provincials around Bristol and the West Country in the UK were excited by the apparent appearance of a pretty, oriental princess who had allegedly been kidnapped by pirates and had made her escape to England, where she came under the protection of the Worralls (Mr Worrall being a magistrate - not a banker as portrayed in the film). Eventually, ten weeks later, she was revealed as a fraud - she was in fact a certain Mary Baker - yet Mrs Worrall, whose sympathy Mary kept even after being unmasked, arranged for her to sail to Philadelphia. The film implies that she had been facing the death penalty for her deception, and that she was to enjoy a new life in America. The truth, more prosaically, is that Mary Baker tired of life in the States after seven years and eventually returned to England in the 1820s, where she died in 1865. All this info can be found at http//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Caraboo and at http//www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/Hoaxipedia/Princess_Caraboo/ All this rather underlines that the film-makers have taken this curious story and given it a harder spin against the English 'establishment', notably the aristocracy (in the form of the prince regent who is purposely made to look ridiculous, a point underlined as 'Caraboo' is apparently faced with the choice of the noble Irish journalist and the foppish and ridiculously dressed up prince). There's no evidence that the historic Caraboo came within spitting distance of the aristocracy, though the British press of the time gleefully had a field day over the gullibility of the local upper classes of Bristol and the surrounding region. Also I'm afraid the contrast of noble/innocent Irishmen (one of Caraboo's fellow inmates is - surprise, surprise - an innocent Irishman) versus evil English power-that-be (the only sympathetic English person who isn't a servant is Mrs Worrall) is becoming a tired clich√©. Pity, because otherwise this is quite an enjoyable film.

It should have made Phoebe Cates a major star--but unfortunately (and mysteriously) she is still best known as the girl Judge Reinhold thinks about in Fast Times at Ridgemont High.The movie is based on the true story of a mysterious girl who convinced a bunch of 19th century upper British Class men she was an Oriental princess. I'll leave the question as to whether she actually is or not up for you to find out.  The performances, writing and direction are uniformly first rate, even magical in that old movie way. Unfortunately, the filmmakers tacked on a completely unearned and unwarrented romantic ending that mars the film. Not only does the romantic pairing of two main characters stretch believability, it is also SO OBVIOUSLY tacked on after the fact that it disrupts the flow of the film, almost ruining what had come before. I can't tell you what the ending is without ruining what pleasure the film will bring you when you see it, but I can say that it doesn't even make sense.

Not only was this a good story, but the women in this film are beautiful. If you're looking for explicit stuff, go elsewhere, but if you find hints of sexuality a turn-on, there's plenty here. There are some liberties taken with the actual story, but so what? What movie doesn't do that? Princess Caraboo is not a sugar-sweet and syrupy G-rated story, and those looking for fairytale family fare may be taken aback at times. I am watching the movie for the second time (had to stop part way through last night) and it seems much different this time, as I know what's going to happen. The mystery may be gone, but there's some good laughs and of course, foxiness abounds. I started the reading the book on which this is based, but didn't finish it, at least not yet. Maybe I'll pick it up again, gotta have it around here somewhere.Kevin Kline does well as a butler, as does Stephen Rea as a journalist. Worth checking out, and if you like early 19th century British period pieces - well, this one is less puffy and ponderous than some.

Therefore, I will use my Princess Caraboo review to assert that we need to recognize Phoebe Cates more than we do. In case you aren't familiar with the name, she starred in Fast Times at Ridgemont High and the Gremlins movies. But this movie constituted one of her most interesting roles. She somehow seems to exactly fit this role of a woman who may or may not be a princess from another part of the world. The whole movie creates an almost mystifying feeling.Also starring is Cates's husband Kevin Kline (who turned 60 yesterday) as a butler; they later co-starred in 2001's The Anniversary Party with their son and daughter. There's also Jim Broadbent and John Lithgow.Worth seeing. "},{"Title":"Where we came from","Date":"2 November 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, History","Review":" This is a fun story. It is best if you don't know ahead of time that Princess Caraboo is a fake, since they tease you back and forth trying to decide.The movie is fun watching her effect on others, particularly the John Lithgow character. Everyone wants to spin their private fantasies around her, but of course deny everything. The deceit tickles.Of course the fake Caraboo can act her part with a perfectly straight face. She is a professional actor, equally capable of playing Mary Baker or Princess Caraboo.The law of the time was so harsh, unfair and arbitrary. It pretty well amounted to the whim of whomever had money. Beggars were jailed for three months or hanged. It intrudes harshly into the fizzy movie several times.Princess Caraboo develops into a Scherezade-like character, who captivates with her stories. People want to believe her stories simply because they are beautiful. For the first part of the movie, Caraboo captivates the audience with her gentle mimes.

I was not at all disappointed, but I thought her acting seemed qualitatively similar to that in Drop Dead Fred, not especially different or better. This is probably the most charming, well-written movie she has starred in, perhaps she's being given some extra credit for that. In any case, Princess Caraboo is an engaging and enjoyable movie. Kline is funny as always, as is Lithgow, though as another reviewer has mentioned, their character's accents are somewhat painful at times. They are both playing for a touch of comedy and farce, so I take it in stride.Well worth picking up.

That's a good way to go into it. Mr. Gutch (Stephen Rea), the newspaper reporter, isn't who he wants to be.  Mrs. Worral, the rich aristocrat who takes the Princess under her wing, isn't who she wants to be.  The servants aren't allowed to be anything other than who they are supposed to be.
