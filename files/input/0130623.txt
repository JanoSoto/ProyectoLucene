No such thing in Dinosaur! It's a serious movie that is very sad and partially cruel a wonderful tale of courage and survival, told with respect for the audience, with unpresidented animations. The dionsaurs merge seemlessly into the real surroundings, and they move and look absolutely real. Finally, computer animations have reached the stage where it doesn't look animated anymore!I was also very touched by Aladar's attempts to save the old dinos, and although I'm a grown-up, I jumped in my seat when the carnotaurs emerged. There was violence in this film cruel battles between carnivores and herbivores. And surging through it all there is a feeling of sadness and loss, for a world that is about to fade away into the pages of history.Thus, it's not for the smallest children, but it's a great story that treats it's audience with respect and pays homage to that great lost Earth that was buried in the dust millions of years ago.9/10 "},{"Title":"Beautiful!","Date":"7 October 2005","Score":"37 out of 45 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Family","Review":" This movie was shear pleasure to watch. The movie looks visually absolutely stunning and the animation is done nicely. It's true eye-candy and entertaining as well.The movie has a typical adventurous story and feeling and is at times spectacular as well. Especially the beginning is impressively spectacular. There are some nicely done action sequences that are at times tense as well. My only true complaint of the movie are the characters. There isn't really any character development in the movie and we never really get to know the character or care much about them, this is probably mainly due to the short running time of the movie. Also of course the story itself is somewhat predictable but that doesn't take away any of the fun or entertainment value of the movie.Dinosaur fans will enjoy this movie as well, unless you're one of those persons who complains about the accuracy of the movie. This movie is entertainment, not a documentary.The musical score by James Newton Howard fits the movie like a glove and in my opinion he delivers one of his best and moving scores, in his career.There is much hate for this movie but quite frankly I can't see why.

It's just a movie and one that is sheer entertainment. People seem to have a problem with the way violence is portrayed but I liked how the directors portrayed the brutally and the honest way death was portrayed. Thankfully, it's not excessively sugar-coated and there are some very sad scenes but it beautifully ends on the note of hope. I liked the way Leighton and Zondag told Enriquez's written story but I thought that some of the situations weren't developed. For example, how does Aladar adjust to the lifestyle of the dinosaurs considering that he was raised by lemurs. Most likely it may have been due to time constraint but nonetheless the current adventurous story of migration and survival is engaging and moving. Aladar's selfless attempts to save the dinosaur's are touching to watch as it reflects how the kind-hearted Plio raised him. The characters are enjoyable and the voice cast, that includes talents like Alfre Woodard, Joan Plowright and Ossie Davis do a fine job. D.B. Sweeney too does a very good job voicing Aladar. The animation is very detailed, giving the characters and setting a very authentic look. Even though the slight stop motion takes away from the realism, this is only a minor quibble. Newton Howard's score flows well with the story. 'Dinosaur' is sheer beauty and a pleasure to look at. It's a dinosaur classic and it's become one of my favourite dinosaur films.

As it is, its the prettiest.","Date":"16 May 2006","Score":"14 out of 17 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Family","Review":" When i heard that the original screenplay o this film planned no dialogue at all for the characters, i became even more disappointed at the end result. While a very good film Dinosaur certainly is, it could have been incredible. The visual effects alone are a sight to behold, never more so than in the opening sequence. This is probably the best stretch in the whole film for me; it's unsanitised by talking animals and genuinely feels like a prehistoric world (ignoring the multitude of historical inaccuracies like grass in the Mesozoic era, particular dinosaurs living side by side). Once the animals start to talk the film is bogged down by the shortcomings of the script, which is idealistic and morally exposition heavy, for the sake of the target audience. It also detracts from the illusion the film so effortlessly produces on the screen at the start; it all just becomes so standard an routine when it seemed to be so much more. With a weak script, the visuals no longer arrest like they did before and would have done had nobody talked. Without the amazing cgi, this could have almost been straight to video.I say almost because despite the shortcomings Dinosaur is a good movie; it's at times thrilling, exhilarating, touching and surprisingly intense, for a movie with a such a routine story. Had it had a better script it could have been great. Had it had no dialogue at all it could have been a classic and perhaps one of Disney's finest. The era of risk taking and inventiveness for the company seems to be at an end, or at least under suppression. Damn you Eisner! They were onto something this time.

But effects are high in the wow factor.","Date":"14 May 2008","Score":"9 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Family","Review":" My Take Terrific special effects make this film worth a million bucks. Through their discovery of the magic of CGI, Disney has brought their own expensive big-budget CG spectacle called DINOSAUR in 2000. Although CGI has already brought to life dinosaurs before in JURASSIC PARK and its sequel THE LOST WORLD JURASSIC PARK, sometimes DINOSAUR has certainly improved from which it started from. The special effects in DINOSAUR are truly spectacular. What's fantasy and what's reality is now indistinguishable.In terms of plot and story, however, DINOSAUR is still not well developed. The story is nothing new and for Disney, that's quite a disappointment. Disney, a master in both animation and storytelling, is now lacking in a new story to show. Still, nonetheless, DINOSAUR is still a wonderfully good-looking fantasy that appeals to kids and adults.The story is nothing original, as Disney simply owes from other animated movies, some of which is their own. The plot that dinosaurs, after a meteorite strike, creates a large famine leading to a search for a valley of fertility is recycled from both a segment in Disney's FANTASIA called The Rite of Spring, as well as Don Bluth's animated THE LAND BEFORE TIME. The lead character, an Iguanadon named Aladar, is separated from his mother, who is supposedly dead, is like the character of BAMBI in Disney's own animated film of the same title. The rest of the characters aren't new with any zing.Still, the film is an enjoyable showcase of fine special effects and excitement. It's still good as visual entertainment. A lot more fun to look at rather than to think about. I liked just looking at the very colorful effects, showing us numerous sights of dinosaurs of all shapes and sizes. The opening scenes were the most colorful, where we are taken to flight in the wings of a flying Pteranodon, switching from various scenery that is a breathtaking sight. There's a lot of imagination that went to the effects, and the heart is not forgotten.Rating **** out of 5.

But this movie, in my opinion, has more points because of the animation then the story itself. It's cute, but with a very ordinary story; besides, there are some important errors here, specially in the beginning in the part of the meteor, when everything is destroyed in the Plio's island That Impact would kill not only the lemurs,but also many of the dinos.

Everyone in the audience was stunned at the incredible visuals. And when it was over, there was a simultaneous Whoa... from everyone in the theater including myself.Then there was all this hoo ha about the inappropriateness of a Kate Bush song so the movie was re-edited and when it finally did come out, it came out rather quietly so I never got around to seeing it in the theater.I just caught the end of it tonight broadcast on the Disney Channel while doing some channel surfing.  They were gracious enough to show it 2 times back-to-back so I sat there and watched it all the way through on the second run.  I'm really mad at myself for forgetting to go and see it in the theater.  Broadcast cable television quality is garbage and what I saw on my television tonight blew me away - I can just imagine how it must have looked in the theater.Is this story a rehashed mix of Tarzan with a dinosaur and a pack of lemurs, and Land Before Time?  Yes.  Does it use the same technique of meshing CGI and live action backgrounds as Discovery Channel's Walking with Dinosaurs? Yes.  But given it took 12 years to make this film, I would believe that it was Walking with Dinosaurs that copied from this film.I am a big fan of CGI animation and I have to say that the first 20 minutes of this film that are set in mostly lush, tropical settings are some of the most impressive CGI / live action scenes I have seen yet.  It looks so real that I found myself having a hard time trying to figure out which elements were CGI and which were live action.Just as James Cameron's Titanic was a visual masterpiece, so is Dinosaur. If you'll remember Titanic won tons of awards for special effects, set decoration, and music.  'Best Background' if you will.  The story was predictable and boring (and I'm not talking about the fact that everyone knew the ship was going to sink either) and the dialogue was flat.  Same thing with Dinosaur.Just as Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor's attack scenes were visually spectacular and the rest of the movie pretty much was a waste - the same could be said for Dinosaur.  I really like the middle hour of Pearl Harbor (from where the Japanese fleet attacks to shortly after they withdraw).  I don't bother watching the rest of the movie.  With Dinosaur the first 20 minutes are incredible up until shortly after the asteroid hits and the last 10 minutes are also visually impressive.  Skip the middle.If you are looking for a perfect movie - this definately isn't it.  But if you are looking to see some incredible animation, there's a good 30 minutes of jaw dropping visuals that every CGI animation fan must see.Watch only the first 20 minutes and the last 10 minutes and this is a 9 out of 10.  Watch it complete and the middle drags it down to about a 5.The visuals were so good, I'm on my way to buy Dinosaur on DVD first thing tomorrow and have no intention of watching the middle hour of it.

I used to wonder if Disney were going to make a movie about dinosaurs and when they did, it wasn't a bad choice to combine GGI characters with real backgrounds.I was impressed by the trailer and when I finally saw Dinosaur first time, I liked some parts, but overall I found the movie a little mediocre. Seeing it for the second time, I appreciated and liked it more, so, once again you've got to take it for what it is to really enjoy it.The visuals is absolutely the big highlight of the film, especially combined with the beautiful and (in my opinion) quirky score of James Newton Howard. The characters are quite all right too (especially Aladar, Zini and Eema), although the film focuses more to move the plot forward. The only character I don't like is Kron. He's so straight forward and narrow-minded that he gets just uninteresting. I was never a fan of The Land Before Time (in fact I hated that movie), who has many similarities to Dinosaur. Like most of us know, the story is unoriginal and (as expected) comes with the usual Disney moral. But the real problem with this film is that it seems like the directors and screenwriters disagreed for which audience this movie would fit too (although it was rated PG). For kids it could be too scary (especially the Carnotaurs, not that I'm a coward, *laughing*) and for the older viewers some parts may be too childish.Like other Disney films, Dinosaur has some tender moments (for those who like romance, there's some of that, too), but the film it self is not too sugar-coated, it's surprisingly straight-forward and serious. There are some comical lines that makes you chuckle, but without sacrificing the integrity of the film. The first act, which shows Aladar's arrival at the lemurs, is actually portrayed in a different, more detailed way than Tarzan's arrival at the apes, which is refreshing to see.Overall, this is not a perfect movie, but it has some great moments, so I like it "},{"Title":"What is peoples problem?","Date":"8 April 2015","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Family","Review":" I honestly don't see why people are so upset whit this movie.

Most of them are fine as they are. Url, Kron and Bruton are not all that good. Oh and this film didn't need a herbivore baddie, they just needed the Carnotaurs, they could have just snipped out Kronk with a pair of scissors. Bruton and Url I am happy to stay, but for me to enjoy the film up to its highest level, it would have been better for Url to be less silly (this film DOES NOT need a silly character) and Bruton should have been in much longer, he shouldn't have played such a minor role. All of the other characters are fine. The other thing that could be changed in the film for me to make it top entertainment, is that SO FEW lemurs are in most of the film. There should be more travelling with Aladar across the desert.Otherwise, I love this film very much. It doesn't have much excitement (PHEW) and it doesn't need it! All these films nowadays have unnecessary excitement. Also, the characters (apart from Kron and partly Bruton) are warm, loving and likable. They also use good dinosaurs for the film and stick to the right era (unlike in the Land Before Time films, although they're good as well).

This predictable but entertaining tale set in the late Cretaceous Period some 65-million years ago seamlessly integrates live-action footage with sophisticated, cutting-edge digital animation.Unfortunately, all the visual special effects magic in Hollywood cannot make up for the depressing, often preachy Dinosaur plot that recycles elements from last summer's Tarzan as well as Disney's The Land Before Time. Basically, this above-average kiddies' opus emerges as a prehistoric spin on Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom TV series.Nimbly directed by Eric Leighton and Ralph (We're Back!&#151;A Dinosaur's Story) Zondag, Dinosaur starts with an incredible ten-minute sequences that not only sets the story into motion but also showcases the impressive advances in computer animation since Toy Story. When a bloodthirsty carnivore (a T-Rex style dino with nose horns) rampages through a herd of peaceful dinosaurs that have just laid their eggs, only one egg survives the catastrophe. A variety of scaly scavengers fight over this egg like the proverbial hot potato until a Pterodactyl snags it and flies across oceans and continents before it loses the egg on Lemur Island, too.A family of primates discovers the egg, and baby Aladar (voice of D.B. Sweeney) wins the hearts of grouchy head lemur Yar (voice of Ossie Davis) and single mom Plio (voice of Alfre Woodward). Naturally, the monkeys adopt this over-sized orphan as one of their own. Of course, Disney writers John Harrison and Robert Nelson Jacobs have taken liberties with history. Lemurs and dinosaurs didn't co-exist, but these historical errors can be condoned as long as they heighten the entertainment value. Oh, yes, Iguanadons are T-Rexes without a bad attitude, but they can swing a mean tail in close-quarters combat. All this peace and prosperity ends spectacularly when a meteor shower devastates Lemur Island, and our animal heroes must flee.Aladar, with his lovable Lemur family clinging to his back, joins up with a herd of dinosaurs crossing an arid desert (like the Jews out of Exodus) to a fabled paradise called the Nesting Grounds. Initially, the idealistic Aladar butts heads with the bossy head dino Kron (voiced of Samuel Wright) who is willing to sacrifice the older dinosaurs, Baylene, a huge Brachiosaurus (voice of Joan Plowright), and Eema, a sluggish styrachosaur (voice of Della Reese), to keep a couple of predatory carnivore at bay. Aladar disagrees with Kron's survival-of-the-fittest strategy and fights the carnivores to save these older, slower dinosaurs.Although the House of Mouse sank nearly $200-million into this ambitious, eye-catching epic, the Disney Studios should have anted up at least a tenth of their lavish budget on a story as creative and original as their special effects wizardry.

It reminded me of Milo & Otis, but all of the excitement and interest wrapped up in a mere 10 minutes, instead of an entire movie - and Milo & Otis was good too! The animation was so lifelike that I was regularly unsure what was computer generated and what was real. And this came out in 2000? Seriously, but for the 3D elements, this was a lot better graphically than Avatar - and this was some 9 years earlier! Truly a masterpiece of cinema. The story was very interesting though it lost a couple of points for 1) unnecessarily making the dinosaurs appear a bit too much like humans and 2) in many ways the story ripped off The Land Before Time - though not entirely. It wasn't a big hit at the box office and if you watch it, you can see why. They tried to make the dinosaurs relatable by giving them human-like features, including their front legs looking and acting more like hands than they should. They even had some dinosaurs that acted more like dogs! Perhaps this is justifiable in a sense but it isn't actually realistic. The story was a good moral lesson for kids and generally I think would be great for kids to watch but it also had something in it for adults, and adults could enjoy the lessons. The story was genuinely interesting and not at all predictable. While there were violent elements, I would still think that children could enjoy it. Overall, a very good piece of entertainment.

While the animation from this film is incredibly good (Even by modern standards) the plot lacks of any kind of interest, being shallow and unoriginal. And to get it worse, it is incredibly boring. The beginning of the film is quite impressive actually. Without any dialogue (Besides a brief opening narration), that first sequence is way more interesting than the rest of the movie, which basically is some sort of CGI version of The Land Before Time, but lacking of all the charm and the endearing characters from that film. And that's why Dinosaur doesn't work Besides of the good animation, the plot remains bland and dull, with many scenes that are pretty to look at, but are quite forgettable, at best. All the attempts to include some elements of comedy in the serious context of the story are ineffective, being most of them quite annoying. Dinosaur could be magnificent in what concerns to the visual aspect, but sadly, it fails at the most important thing Being entertaining. It is way too silly and shallow too be interesting for the adults, but at the same time, it is way too boring and heavy-handed to be enjoyable for the kids. To be honest, I enjoyed more any episode from Walking with Dinosaurs than this.

And the word 'animation' to describe this movie seems to be a misnomer; this is not a cartoon or even a cardboard-cutout lay-over a-la Toy Story. 'Computer-generated action' or animation would be better terms, since the characters all look 'real', especially to a child. I was impressed with all the nuances that were caught, such as the way pupils dilated, the way flesh of the creatures' bodies shook with movement. If you want to get deep into meanings, the film is also a story about how being arrogant and self-centered (Kron) and not being willing to accept others' input, eventually brings you down; and how standing together can help defeat evil.

"},{"Title":"Yes, the Carnotaurus WAS a real dinosaur","Date":"3 February 2001","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Family","Review":" First of all, I need to clarify this.  So many other people have commented on how Dinosaur doesn't look as good/wasn't as good as Toy Story 1 and 2. Well, Pixar is the name of the company that made those movies.  Pixar has an 5 movie contract with Disney.  The Toy Stories, the upcoming Monsters Inc., and A Bug Life were created by Pixar and released under the Disney name. Now, Dinosaur was made by Walt Disney Feature Animation.  This was their first attempt at making a CGI film.  I think for a first try, they did pretty damn good.A lot of the critiques of this film are just Disney bashing, for its own sake.  I'm sure if this film had been produced by another studio it would have received a more positive reception from some imdb users.  We expect perfection from the Mouse, and they don't quite deliver here.  Some people just hate Disney to hate Disney.  I prefer to rate the film, not the studio that made it.  Dinosaur has its good moments and its bad ones.  It's not a bad film, but it's not wonderful either.  It's just average.I think the visuals in this movie are beautiful.  To my eye, the CGI dinosaurs and the live action background plates don't quite mesh together, creating an otherworldly feel.  It doesn't look quite real, and that is okay with me.  I got chills during the courtship scene.  I didn't think anything of how (supposedly, according to reviews I have previously) Disney is teaching children bizarre sex rituals.  I took it for what it was; the sunset and the music and the lemurs flitting from vine to vine just captivated me.The 2 disc DVD set is well worth the extra ten bucks.  You get a ton of making of bonus features and deleted scenes.  The amount of work that went into each scene just boggles my mind; DVD users, check out the section on the meteor strike.  There are about 8 layers of special effects in just this one shot of Aladar running towards the camera.I was mesmerized just watching how each creature moved.  I found myself looking at the muscular structure of the lemurs and being impressed at the accuracy.  Eema actually moved like something who was carrying far too much weight.  The Iguanadons, though ugly, moved well and I liked that they shook themselves like dogs.  That was an interesting touch.  You could actually see skin settling and fur moving in a realistic manner.  I liked that the animators thought to include the Iguanadon thumb spike in the few battle scenes, as they were probably used for just that fighting amongst males, and defense.  My only problem with movement, overall, was Baylene's rearing up to knock down a stone wall; scientific evidence has shown that sauropods were probably too heavy to do this.As far as the character animation goes, the film has its good and bad moments.  I didn't like Aladar's horse face expressions very much.  The animators couldn't do much with the stiff facial muscles of real Iguanadons, so they animated Aladar sans beak, and with the facial muscles of a horse instead.  This looks awkward at times, especially for 3/4 view and front facing shots.  Yar's flapping jowls put me off at first, until I realized that was supposed to convey age.  At first viewing I thought he was supposed to be toothless.  Neera just had a scary, scary head; an Iguanadon with a horse face AND girly cheekbones?  Uh, no thanks. Kron and Bruton looked very similar, and very ugly.  I'd imagine that Iguanadons were much more uniform looking than this film would have us believe.And yes, I liked the way the villains were handled.  The Carnotaurus pair were animated very well.  I'm glad they didn't give them some hokey villain voices.  We didn't have to deal with any overblown, villainous monologues. I'm glad their role in the film was kept simple also; they were simply hungry dinosaurs.  That herd must have looked like easy pickings to them. And yes, the Carnotaurus was a real dinosaur that did exist at one time. They did have those horns.  Disney didn't make these guys up, they just borrowed an obscure dinosaur from history since the T Rex has been used so much in other films.Now, the bad stuff.  I cringed at some of the dialogue (jerkasaurus), and I didn't like the prevalence of modern slang coming out of the mouths of dinosaurs and lemurs.  The monkey jokes were awful.  And that line about the buffet of love was pretty much lost on the film's target audience, older children.  I didn't like that the dinosaurs called each other by scientific names we humans gave them well after digging up their bones. How odd it was to have Eema explain to Aladar what a Carnotaurus was.  And why in the hell does a dinosaur keep a pet dinosaur, anyway?  Url should have been dropped from this movie.  I wanted him to be picked off by the raptors.The plot is simple.  I'll have to admit, when I first saw the teaser trailer my mind started to whirl with possibilities.  My heart sank when I heard there would be dialogue.  Like I mentioned before, the slang is uneccessary.  Why does one dinosaur (Baylene) have a british accent?  The moral at hand for this film was teamwork.  Harmless enough.  But how do you explain to a child that, in real life, the weaker herd members are killed off in most animal species?  That a straggling oldster is sure to be ignored by any animal species you can name.  That dumbing down of the food chain bothered me a little.  But then I remembered, this is a kid's movie.  And the mixing of species from different time periods was sort of a puzzle to me as well.  I can place Eema and Aladar in the same time period, and thats about it.  Those lemurs are modelled after modern day lemurs, not any primitive types.  I'm not sure why they stuck them in there, but they are pretty damn cute.Overall, I find this film to be a flawed masterpiece.  It is not a family film.  I would not allow any child younger than 10 to view it, however, as there as strong depictions of violence and some intense dinosaur fights. I hated the prevalence of Disney morals.  I thought the score was excellent. I enjoyed the dinosaur sounds, trumpets, squeaks and roars.  I wanted Url to be eaten.  This is a film for the hard core Disneymaniac, dinosaur enthusiast and animation buff.  Be thankful the Old Gotoma subplot (as seen on the deleted scenes of the DVD) was dropped.  Enjoy the movie! -) "},{"Title":"WOOHAA","Date":"2 February 2001","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Family","Review":"  Like the tagline says, you've never seen anything like Dinosaur, at least not from Disney.

They've managed to make some the most classic and well loved stories into sugar-coated, campy musicals (who ever heard of singing gargoyles). Now these all work well for little kids, but I was ready for a movie that would stand out in some way, and I found that with Dinosaur.For one thing, the visuals are astounding. You could turn the t.v. on mute and still enjoy it. Some of the scenes, especially at the beginning, literally take your breath away. The viewer experiences a myriad of locations from the lush rainforests to sand dunes to caves and back again. The amazing thing is that all of the backgrounds are real.For another thing the story is great. Don't go in expecting an incredibly deep movie with sharp dialogue. These are dinosaurs. Their brains aren't that big. They can't use large words. Nevertheless, the story is compelling, and for once I actually felt some emotion with a Disney movie. You really pity the old Dinosaurs who can't keep up (one of whom is voiced by Della Reese, which made me incredibly happy). You really feel the love of the lemur family and you really feel the fear of a carnotaur attacking you. The plot may not by sophisticated, but there is substance.And for a third thing the music meshes perfectly with the rest of the film. The composers expertly use different world music combined with a dramatic orchestral score to provide a very dinosaur-esque soundtrack.

I expected a similarly pleasing experience with Dinosaur. I was surprised by the seriousness of the movie. The visuals were amazing. Impressive camera angles, nice pans and a soundtrack that I found very good - but that's a matter of taste, I guess. The animations might not have been flawless, but what would you expect with *speaking* dinosaurs? Dinosaurs from different periods were wildly mixed, along with a few mammals. But this was a movie, not a documentary. I expect to be entertained, not educated. (My recommendation for a documentary Walking with Dinosaurs) I found Dinosaur in a few instances maybe a bit too strong for young kids in the depiction of violence.Someone commented that the movie would have gained a lot if the dinos hadn't been speaking. And that reminded me of the French movie The Bear (I hope that's that title in English) in which a baby bear is orphaned and struggles for survival in the French mountains. The movie involves almost no speech, only the occasional narrator and a few words by humans that the bear (unfortunately) encounters. I think Dinosaur could have worked very well without spoken dialogue, too, maybe even better.Some people criticized about the plot. The script was modelled as a western movie with dinosaurs and if you go into the movie with that knowledge you quickly recognize the patterns - trek, dangers, rivalries about leadership, etc.Whether you like it or not depends on what you are looking for. It is NOT a realistic documentary-style movie. It is also NOT a Disney-movie in the style of Pocahontas, Mulan, or Aladdin. The plot is NOT of the depth of War and Peace or a Stanley Kubrick movie.

It went on my must-see list immediately. Seeing as there was no talking in it, I somehow got the idea that the whole movie was going to be sans dialogue. A bold move, I thought, makes me want to see it even more.I should have known better.Before long, I'd heard the disappointing truth Dinosaur was going to be another Talking Animal movie. Then I actually went and saw the movie and was surprised to find I LIKED watching these animals talk. For the first time, a full cast of digitally animated characters is set against a live background and it works. They weren't trying for absolute realism here. These monsters aren't as real looking as those in Jurassic Park or The Lost World. This, I believe, is intentional. What the animators were going for here was Beauty. The most daunting challenge Disney's new digital studio faced was getting audiences to forget how the movie was made and concentrate on the story-something Pixar was able to pull off with both Toy Story films. Like Toy Story, Dinosaur is an enormous achievement because it surpasses simply being a technical marvel to end up being a really Good Film.Seeing as nobody knows exactly what caused the dinosaurs' extinction or even how they really behaved with each other, the filmmakers give themselves a lot of license when it comes to historical accuracy. If you go, or I should say, When you go see it, don't expect the most original of stories. Dinosaur follows the Disney formula closely. The odd-man-out story line they've employed time and time again--you know the one--the main character is rejected by or separated from his own people, makes a journey of self-discovery, then finds the courage to institute change and become a hero to the people from which he was estranged. I'm not complaining. I loved this movie. The Disney formula is a good one and, as long as they come up with original ideas to plug into it, I'll keep going to see the movies they make.The odd-man-out hero here is Aladar, a young iguanadon, who is separated from his mother in an attack by a carnotaur. He's then found by a family of lemurs and, in a plot point that resembles Disney's own Tarzan a bit too closely, rejected at first, but then accepted into the clan. The Tarzan thread continues when Aladar starts feeling pangs of loneliness watching the girl and boy lemurs pair off. All hope of finding a suitable mate seems lost. A meteor then crashes into the ocean, destroys half the world, and sends Aladar and his surviving family members on a desperate search for a new place to live. Aladar and his family soon come across a herd of dinosaurs traveling across the desert to the nesting grounds. Kron, a fellow iguanadon and the herd's leader, believes in the survival-of-the-fittest philosophy of life and has no pity for the weaker, slower members of the herd. Aladar believes that everyone can make it across the desert safely if they all work together. It is upon this conflict that the rest of the story is built. Oh, and Kron has a sister, Neera. She's single and Kron would like to keep it that way.There's no telling how long people's fascination with these huge beasts will last. My theory is, it's only just beginning. The only thing more intriguing than thinking about the world they lived in is thinking about how they became extinct. The most popular theory nowadays is that an outside force, such as a giant meteor hitting the earth, was responsible. It's the most scientifically plausible explanation. This gives us a sense of connectedness with the dinosaurs. Just as humans now rule the earth in the age of mammals, dinosaurs ruled the earth during the age of reptiles. When we stand and stare at the bones of one of these creatures in a museum, the question is not &#145;Will it happen to us,' but rather, &#145;How long before it happens to us?'So now that the technology is available, a special effects-driven dramatic film with recounting the dinosaurs' struggle in the aftermath of a meteor hitting the earth HAD TO HAPPEN. This put the film's creators under a lot of pressure to create a work that would give people what they were looking for. Only time will tell if they succeeded.

So, obviously, the movie should appeal to anyone who is interested in computer animation and/or filmmaking.

As an animation student I loved the CG stuff and the scenery in some parts was just breathtaking, in the opening few minutes when Aladar as an egg is passed from one dinosaur to another, he is taken in the beak of a giant bird and if your stomach doesn't drop as it soars over a cliff edge showing a 2,000 + ft drop on the other side, you must be clinically dead.The animation is brilliant, the facial expressions on the animals especially the monkey characters is great and the meteor storm that forces Aladar and his adoptive family to flee is just spectacular. I've read some of the other comments about this film, and some of them, seem to be picking holes for the sake of it, one stated that the dinosaurs were the wrong colour and they walked differently, to me this is just sematics, if you want realism to that extent, you want 'Walking with Dinosaurs' from Discovery not Dinosaur from Disney.I must admit finding the talking idea a bit hard to handle to begin with coupled with the ultra realism of the dinosaurs but after a while you just accept it, although I am glad they drew the line at having the dinos sing a la the usual Disney style.The story is well worn, and taken straight from  'The Land Before Time', you have the feeling that with the amount of films that seem to have this story all the dinosaurs would be living in happy retirement in a green, sunlit valley.All in all a good film, fairly typical Disney, brilliant animation - regardless of the story (which I would have to say is the only real down side to this) the good guys (plant eaters or Veggie Saurus as the are referred to in Jurassic Park) and the bad guys meat eaters - (if I was A T-rex or similar  creature I might want to sue for deformation of character) and a meaningful story, in this case, survival of the fittest may be the case in the Jungle, but when your a Disney Dinosaur you take care of the smaller and weaker guys as well, proving that team work is the way to go, which to me isn't such a terrible message.some who take small children might want to look out for the 'Bad Guy - Meat Eaters' happily chomping a on some of the smaller less fortunate creatures, nothing gory, but some younger viewers might find it a bit too 'real'.Remember this is a film and a Disney film at that, it's not a documentary, although it seems at times the film isn't to sure of this point. I know with the realistic dinos you figure if Disney go this far, why not go the whole hog and get every little detail right, well I'm sorry but that's nit picking, films in general no matter what genre, Live Action, Animated or a mix, have a degree of artistic licence which you have to accept. Go see this for what it is, a Disney film with some lovable characters, good cinematography and some great animation.

At the end of the film, something remarkable happened.The audience began to applaud.In years of moviegoing, I don't think I've ever seen that happen.  And, coming out of it, I had to join in.  It is perhaps one of the most remarkable films I have ever seen.The film centers around a dinosaur named Aladar, who must bring his adoptive family to safety after the extinction event 65 million years ago.  He treks through the wasteland that was once a fertile continent and joins a herd looking for a mythical breeding ground that may still be untouched.While this is a film for almost all ages, I would recommend against letting the younger children watch it.  It has to be the bleakest Disney film ever produced.  Not only is there on-screen death, but there is a lot of it.  Aladar and his mammalian family wander through a dangerous and truly shattered world, where survival of the fittest is a reality and compassion is the ideal.I should probably say at least one thing about the special FX; this is a dinosaur movie almost without visible FX.  It is literally photo-realistic, making it the first live-action quality film to have completely computer-generated actors.  Jurassic Park has not only been given a run for its money, but been beaten at its own game.Perhaps the big criticism I would have to give is that it should have been longer by at least half an hour.  The story was certainly tight and well-done, but there was enough material to go on much longer and say far more.Still, I left the theatre feeling that I had seen something profound.  Dinosaur is a truly special film, and I think it just might end up changing filmmaking in the manner as Star Wars did in 1977.Final mark 4/5; probably should have been longer, but definitely worth seeing.

That said, this is no Pixar film, and can't seriously challenge Pixar's ascending product. A certain watch for everyone who's ever liked a Disney film, since this should be watchable at least for anyone who's been enchanted by a Disney classic.Unlike most other films, 'Dinosaur' doesn't revolve around a single-layer story line. Usually, the plot centres around a hero-beats-bad-guy-and-falls-in-love-with-heroine theme. In 'Dinosaur', the two themes are present, but are interwoven carefully and pulls it off with near-perfection. The computer effects are ground-breaking, if just a level below the stuff these days. One complaint is the lack of attention given minor characters. The nameless lemurs have static fur and look like stuffed toys rather than real animals. The major characters, by contrast, are meticulously designed with realistic fur, seemingly produced strand by strand. The best (or worst) example of this is when Suri sits at the top of a tree surrounded by random lemurs. She looks magnificently real, but the animators' accomplishment with Suri is overshadowed by the absolutely unrealistic characters surrounding her.Besides the occasional laziness, the visuals are spectacular. The meteor shower sequence is one of the best examples of technical wizardry in films. The menacing beauty of it will imprint itself upon your mind. The characterization is satisfying on the whole, with a more extensive use of side-kicks than usual. The characters of Eema, Balene, Yar and the rest of the lemurs isn't just for laughs; the characters also feature in emotional scenes, key sequences in the film's structure. Another example of laziness in 'Dinosaur' is the robbery of scenes from Don Bluth's masterpiece, 'The Land Before Time'. Some shots are almost exact duplicates of the traditionally animated film. Some of the themes are repeated as well. Even though 'Dinosaur' is a great film by modern standards, it cannot beat 'The Land Before Time', as 'Dinosaur' just isn't a classic. It will not stay with you forever like the old films. It will enchant you every time you watch it, but you won't think of it that much when you're not watching it. That's why I'm writing this at the moment. My 'Dinosaur' DVD is playing right now.

Though I am partial to the much vibrant and much more colorful hand-drawn animation, the visual effects here are very realistic and detailing compiled, making it look like it is a live-action film versus an animated one. The story starts off quite intense with an attack of a carnivorous dinosaur on a herd of peaceful plant-eaters. But, the plot then becomes quite slow with the uninteresting subplot about the lemurs raising an orphaned Iguanodon named Alidar, and them playing matchmakers to the younger lemurs. Once the animals start to talk the plot is bogged down by the modern-sounding dialog, which is very distracting since the story takes place in the prehistoric period.The journeying-to-the-nesting-grounds-while-avoiding-carnivores plot is the main plot of the film and is at times thrilling and exhilarating, producing some intense scenes and heartfelt moments, particular where Alidar stays behind the traveling herd to help older dinosaurs Baylene and Eema and where the stern-hearted Bruton fights the Carnotaurus to protect Alidar and company. However, the film has a rather routine story due to predictable moments and very few emphasis on other dinosaurs.Overall, it's an average Disney film with some exciting moments.

Basically over a million years ago the dinosaurs lived and roamed the Earth, and we see one dinosaur grow up raised by lemurs after finding his egg, that we see travel a long way. Years later orphaned Iguanodon dinosaur Aladar (D.B. Sweeney) has grown up with the lemurs as his family, but danger soon shows itself when a small meteor crashes and causes a tidal wave that destroys their home. Moving on to find a place to settle they all come across a herd of other dinosaurs from all species, but all herbivores, who are heading for the nesting ground, i.e. big green valley. Leading the dinosaurs is the little caring Kron (The Little Mermaid's Samuel E. Wright) who says that any weak that fall behind and give up should be ignored and forgotten about, of course Aladar cares about them. There is a point when they think they are not far away travelling through the desert, and they are desperate for water, and even though a way to get it is found digging and pressing the dry ground Aladar is still ignored. He finds himself attracted to same breed Kron's sister Neera (Ghost Ship's Julianna Margulies), and he has a few friends in the herd who listen to him, including Brachiosaurus - Baylene (Joan Plowright), Styracosaurus - Eema (Della Reese), and Ankylosaurus - Url. Aladar and his friends find themselves separated from the herd and end up resting in a cave, and they find out it is a passage into the nesting ground, but of course Kron again ignores them because he is so arrogant. In the end, after escaping the vicious Velociraptors and a Carnotaur, Kron dies, and Aladar is finally listened to, all the dinosaurs reach the valley in safety and live happily ever after, well, until their killed off. Also starring Alfre Woodard as Plio (lemur), Ossie Davis as Yar (lemur), Max Casella as Zini (lemur), Hayden Panettiere as Suri (lemur) and Peter Siragusa as Bruton (Iguanodon).

Aladar must persevere against the slap of reality that the outer realms of his former sanctuary are all too real.The graphics left me in awe, it was very realistic! The story though, it's kind of cheesy, I mean people must of really loved all points of the story, romance, epic violence, sappy emotional scenes (no offense), the scene in the cave was rather cool, I've got to admit. But the artists of the film made the good guy characters look to humanoid, especially Aladar's species (Igaunodon), he almost looked like he had a human face. Ema, the Triceratops, was rather realistic though, but her pet thing was sorta like a dog. The Carnotaur was a notable entity in this flick, it was extremely savage and forbidding, it was creepy how mentally haunted it was just to get food, creepier yet living food that you found charming.Buts its a film you'll want to see once every few years.

As a possible 1st attempt of Disney to make a movie only about dinosaurs, it leaves to be desired.It also has a lot to do with the time it was made. It is already from the CGI era instead of Disney's Golden Ages. As such, it can't be compared to the Disney classics from the good old days.Many people seem to compare this to 'The Land Before Time'. I can see where that comparison comes from. While not a copy of 'The Land Before Time', it certainly has its resemblances - not just because it has dinosaurs, but also some of the plot. Anyway, this (by no means) doesn't have the magic of 'The Land Before Time', which is a masterpiece, one of the most charming animated films and one of the greatest films in general. There will never another one like that.I liked some of the lemurs and Aladar (the dinosaur) was the best character of the whole movie. But I didn't like Kron and his attitude. The other characters were not very interesting either.The velociraptors made me think of 'Jurassic Park', but they just don't fit in this film, unlike in the great 'Jurassic Park'.This film is a combination of live-action backgrounds with computer animation, which results in some great images. In some cases, they seem so real that you'd have a hard time of thinking of them as CGI stuff.

The trailers for Dinosaur showed the first seven minutes or so of the movie, where we saw first-class, revolutionary animation of CGI dinosaurs superimposed against real backgrounds and the blending was seamless. These dinosaurs looked just as good as the beasts that wowed us in Jurassic Park. What's more, they acted like real dinosaurs. They didn't speak or behave like human beings covered with scales at all. Added with a majestic score by the great James Newton Howard, the trailer had me excited. I'd had my fill of talking dinosaurs with The Land Before Time and its excessive sequels; I wanted to see real dinosaurs without people in the foreground. That would have been a dream come true for a young dinosaur-lover like me.And Disney was originally going to give me that dream. That's right, folks, the first seven minutes of Dinosaur was originally going to set the mood for the entire picture. The dinosaurs would act like dinosaurs and not like people; it would be like a feature-length version of the Rite of Spring sequence from Disney's 1940 masterpiece Fantasia. But a Mr. Michael Eisner of Disney insisted on changing this all and revamping this concept for a real winner into basically just a retread of The Land Before Time with CGI instead of hand-drawn animation. Mr. Eisner ought to be ashamed of himself, because instead of getting this wondrous spectacle that the trailers and the first seven minutes of the movie promised us, we got just a generic family movie special only in its animation, but destined to be forgotten outside of the special effects department.I suppose Mr. Eisner's reasoning was that kids could not follow a story about dinosaurs without a) people or b) dinosaurs that act like people. Well, to him, I say your reasoning is backward. I was a kid at the time and I was disappointed to hear that the dinosaurs were going to start acting like people after the opening sequence. I would have been okay with narration; heck, I would have been okay if the lemurs in the movie voiced by Ossie Davis, Alfre Woodard, Max Casella, and Hayden Panettiere talked. But why the dinosaurs? What's more, even if they were to talk, why did they have to have such humanlike qualities? They have conversations, morals, love interests, and even philosophies. Oh, and some species of dinosaurs keep other dinosaurs for pets, too. The romantic subplot between two dinosaurs in the movie is completely wooden, generic, and worst of all, boring. That's a real disappointment for me because these dinosaurs are animated via some of the most impressive CGI I have ever seen. Like Roger Ebert noted in his spot-on review for the picture, the filmmakers spent a lot of effort making these dinosaurs look real, but spent more effort undermining that illusion. The only dinosaurs that do thankfully carry the illusion through are the carnivorous dinosaurs, who only snarl and roar and don't appear to have any morality or philosophy. And besides, did Pinocchio have a love interest? No? Then why should a dinosaur?But enough of me bashing what doesn't work. Now I will tell you this despite all of my complaints and suggestions (ones that would have made this a great picture instead of a good one), the movie does, I repeat, *does* entertain. It's a most adequate family picture that is sure to wow and amaze its many-aged audience members with its wonderful animation, strong voice acting, and dazzling moments of energetic action. I also appreciate that for the snarling antagonist, they chose a carnotaurus as opposed to the typical tyrannosaurus or allosaur. It's refreshing to see a new dinosaurs here and there. But why, oh, why, Disney, did you have to go and throw away such a brilliant idea for a more generic and forgettable one? The first seven minutes of Dinosaurs are absolutely wonderful. Before the dinosaurs talk, when they act like dinosaurs, when we see the real wonder and viciousness of that strange prehistoric time, the movie scores with absolute brilliance. But save for the animation, what follows is rather generic. Oh, there I go again....I like Dinosaur but I really feel that it is a missed opportunity. A colossal one. This was my reaction when I first saw in the movie at the age of nine in 2000. Now seeing it again for the first time in years, my reaction is exactly the same. The people running the company once owned by the brilliant Walt Disney ought to reflect upon his genius and his ideas and his masterpieces. If they had done this (as they had wanted to before Mr. Michael Eisner stepped in) Dinosaur would have been a great movie, one destined to be remembered like the Rite of Spring sequence in Fantasia that its opening so reminds us of. But beyond that opening sequence, there is nothing that isn't well, like the dinosaurs themselves, fossilized. I will not deny that I ultimately liked the movie, nor will I deny that given its potential, I felt a little cheated.

Eric Leighton, Ralph Zondag) Story During an attack on a pack of Iguanodon, an egg is separated and ends up with the possession of a group of lemurs. The lemurs care for this egg and the young creature born from it, which they call Aladar. When a meteor shower hits earth, Aladar and his family must leave their homeland. Away from home and as close to danger as they have ever been, they meet up with a huge group of dinosaurs, led by Kron and Bruton. All together they are trying to reach the nesting grounds, but it's not going to be easy.Actors The choices of actors for this animated film are very well chosen. Their voices fit well with the characters. The actors aren't too well known, which is a good point as it doesn't distract you from the characters. You can actually imagine the creatures having that voice. The voices also make feel emotions towards them, especially the Brachiosaurus with her frail voice.Music The music in this film, although not very memorable, it can be very beautiful. James Newton Howard composes a score that fits in so well with the image which is happening on screen, that you can sometime feel emotional. One wonderful example of this is the end scene, where everyone is in the nesting grounds. The score is amazing during this scene and you can really feel for these animated characters.Special Effects The way this film has been made is interesting. The dinosaurs are obviously computer generated, but the background scenery is live action. Although this would have looked remarkable back in 2000, today, sadly it doesn't have as much of an impact. 'Jurassic Park' which was released in 1993, has better looking dinosaurs. This can be overlooked though, as the dinosaurs are beautiful and do have that Disney feel to it.Conclusion 'Dinosaur' was destined to be an advancement in computer generated films, unfortunately it isn't all that it was made out to be. There are some good effects and very emotional, but the main problem for this film, is the story it has. There isn't really much of a story. The dinosaurs are basically following a heard of dinosaurs to a new location. The film seems to be more focused on the relationships between the characters.

We should give Disney credit, what better way to make your animations realistic than layer the characters on top of real landscapes? But this very same credit could very well be taken away for the exact same reason because some scenes are beautifully contrasted and work wonders yet some scenes seem unrealistic with sloppy layering. The story revolves around a dinosaur named Aladar who was raised bye a pack of lemurs from birth. Aladar the goes on a quest to find himself and conquer over evil with messages about how size doesn't matter and how you should stand up for yourself and you can be stronger as a group than as an individual and so on, are you asleep yet because this seems to be the same basic story that has been told in almost every Disney movie made? The animation is spectacular and the settings are beautifully shot but Disney made a suffers a huge downfall in making this film not appealable to a distinct age group. It is much to intense for their younger audience and it's far to goofy to keep adults interested but still it became a huge summer blockbuster. Instead of providing the viewer with any fast on the history of dinosaurs, Disney made up a fictionalized bias of what could life have been back in that period of time making it rather uninteresting for more mature minded audiences. If not for anything else you should see this film for its attempt (although be it a weak one) to bring something new to the fold and that dazzling animation (the meteor scene is simply jaw-droping). Maybe I didn't enjoy this because I didn't know whether I should laugh or cry about the events taking place in front of my eyes so I did neither, I went emotionless through almost the whole thing because I could not get a firm grasp on what the film was trying to present to the viewers.

This movie's plot is dangerously close (legal action?) to this cel-animated movie about dinosaurs as well.  It looks like Disney shoved Universal's plot in the microwave for about fifteen seconds--not necessarily long enough to entirely deform it, but keep the same idea.  That and the fact there are monkeys in this film (um, a little out of the time line of evolution are we Disney?).  The one that has a 'love attack' for females is kind of strange (the love what?).

Somehow, somebody made a cruel mistake and let this movie become a child movie with very limited appeal to adults.Furthermore, the cruelty depicted in the scenes of this film is so graphic that a lot of parents had to walk out of the theatre, because their kids couldn't stop crying. So it isn't even a kid's film. It is too violent and graphic for that, too. That leaves Dinosaur in a very interesting situation. It is too graphic and cruel to be a kid's movie, but too simple and not gripping or emotionally engaging enough (ala Lion King again) to be a movie adults can enjoy.Those are the weak points... but one look at the lush landscapes, the PERFECT dinosaurs, the incredible hair and facial expressions of all the creatures in the forest... makes you know CG have reached a new high for Disney.

(Mild spoiler warning)I couldn't help but have high hopes for the first few minutes, where the dinosaurs interacted in a non-anthropomorphic style, however, when the lemurs (which probably didn't exist in the late jurassic period when this movie was set) started talking, I quickly decided that I would enjoy the movie for it's spectacular graphics rather than it's cheesey plot (if you could call it that).The graphics were astounding. The scenes that I enjoyed best were the pterodactyl flight over the breath-taking landscape, and the large meteor shower. I also enjoyed the eyes of the characters, which had lovely coloration.However, the graphics in all their magnificence could not recover the movie's plot (or lack of it). Honestly, the whole thing was really Disney 101. Why did the dino's have to talk? And why couldn't the big evil carnotaurs (which I don't think are even a real kind of dinosaur) talk if the good vegetarian ones could? The entire movie was pretty much a splicing of The Land Before Time and The Lion King. The main character raised by an adopted family, trecking through the desert when his home was totaled, while all the time dealing with slobbering, villainous carnivorous dinos, the testy girlfriend, and her bad tempered brother. I sat through the whole film saying things like, Hey, they did that in 'The Land Before Time', or,Gee, that scene looks a lot like one from 'The Lion King.' Of course, there was hardly any one else there to complain about my complaints.Yet, all of those comments are the skeptical fifteen-year-old talking.

Well, we're using the latest digital technology to make that into a feature length motion picture!  It will be awesome!And so the film Dinosaur was born -- paying great homage to the Rite of Spring dinosaurs in Fantasia, as well as all six versions of Universal's The Land Before Time.     And just like `The Land Before Time,' the dino's can talk. (At least the plant-eaters and the mammals have this ability.)Of course 82 minutes of watching dinosaurs walking through a desert would be somewhat boring (as well as depressing), so they cut that part down to a mere 72 minutes, and added 10 minutes worth of story concerning how the lead character; a dino named Aladar; was brought into the world.In typical Disney fashion, the lead character is not allowed to be brought up by his own parents -- who knows what sort of crazy ideas people might get if they saw Aladar being raised by his mommy & daddy?  So in the great tradition of The Jungle Book, Tarzan, The Lion King, George of the Jungle, Mighty Joe Young, Hercules Pollyana, etc., (you get the idea...) Aladar is brought up by someone other than his natural parents. In his particular case, it is a tribe of cute little lemurs (primative primates) whom Aladar has to be careful not to step on, less the family troop becomes the family goop.   Aladar spends his time attempting to show how fruitless and immoral  the Darwinian philosophy of `survival of the fittest' truly is.It is also seems to be an act of high treason to portray carnivores as a positive role model in a dinosaur film.   It is a steadfast rule that the herbivores (a.k.a veggie-saurs, `plant-eaters') are ALWAYS the good guys, and the carnivores (a.k.a. `raptors,' `tyranosaurs,' etc...) are ALWAYS the bad guys.  As a matter of fact, to make them come across exactly like the demonic creatures from the pits of hell that they surely must have been, they are not even allowed to TALK; even though every single veggiesaurus is quite conversant in various philosophical and political whims of their prehistoric culture.  And to make absolutely sure you GET THE POINT that meat-eaters are bad, bad, bad; they even come up with a pseudo-dino name for the biggest of them, the carnotaurs  (Just like carnivores -- get it???) Think of the T-Rex from Jurassic Park, having a really bad hair day. No, can't let those guys have an intelligent conversation, less we find ourselves identifying with them, and hope they wipe out those sad little herbivores as they go forth in their rampant deforestation of the earth. No wonder most of planet is a desert.The carnotaurs provide the usual protaganist element that they've been typecast into so relentlessly, as if raptors, the desert, and a fascist igaunadon named `Kron' simply weren't protaginistic enough.   Seeing this movie really makes me appreciate the Pixar characterization of `Rex' in the Toy Story films.As you might have guessed, if you've seen all the films I've listed above, or even some of them, then you've already seen this film.   The only thing that makes this film worth while is the amazing feats of computer generated imagery that Disney pulled out of their hats.  The visuals are absolutely stunning, especially the meteor shower that causes widespread destruction. Too bad they didn't have an original story to go with it.  (If I were Universal I'd sue...)There's a nice little moral tale concerning teamwork and getting everyone to work together.   I'm all for teamwork, but somehow having it illustrated by a group of large, extinct prehistoric creatures just doesn't work.   Other Disney films, especially the Toy Stories, do a much better job of illustrating the concept.Disney is certainly lacking in the originality department lately, as they remake or rehash all their best films of the past, or the good films and TV shows of other studios.   But if they should ever dare to remake Pollyanna, I'm going to personally request that the Chinese use Hollywood as a testing ground for their nuclear missile program.If you want your kids to get see an educated film about dinosaurs, get the BBC's Walking with Dinosaurs.   If you want your kids to be entertained; and learn a good moral lesson; then go fetch yourself a copy of Iron Giant, the last good animation to be released on video/DVD.

Are you old enough to remember what a novel joy Disneyland used to be? I feel sorry for kids today. Personally, I refuse to return to Disneyland ever again. It's way, way too crowded. But there's something else - sinister, about the place. It was always there hidden beneath the wonderful fantasy and charm. I think you know what I mean. Every attraction was sponsored by a corporation. This was fine when it was subtly presented. Even though current Disney executives are certainly intelligent enough and capable of exhibiting subtlety, they do not exercise it. This may have something to do with the rampant commercialization of society today - i.e. people not only do not expect subtlety, they firmly do not want it as we are in an age of hard realities. Whatever it is, Disneyland has been ruined by it. Dinosaur is but one more example of such commercial interests having overwhelmed any semblance of charm and fantasy in Disney's current fare.This is why I feel sorry for many of today's kids. Kids SHOULD have sweet, charming stories either read or presented in some other way to them. Remember Danny Kaye singing The Ugly Duckling? Today Elton John sings a ballad and we adults are supposed to appreciate the similarity, the apparent notion that Disney is carrying on a tradition of sentimentality. But something has changed in the interim. The Kaye tune heard by kids today would likely be rejected as too sweet. There is an edge that Rock grooves present that Swing tunes comparably do not have. It has something to do with the heavy backbeat. Then there's the intelligence quotient factor which, believe it or not, is directly related to one's ability (or not) to feel and appreciate deeper, grander and more delicately sentimental entertainment. Which leads us to Dinosaur and why this film was made.Some saw Walking with Dinosaurs, a documentary film recently produced with identical state-of-the-art animation techniques as Dinosaur. In fact, Dinosaur is the mainstream commercial feature presentation of this new, cutting edge animation technique while Walking with Dinosaurs was the original, experimental and more intelligent documentary feature presentation. I suppose we should feel lucky to have even received Walking with Dinosaurs; we could have got only Dinosaur.The fact that Walking.. was a documentary feature reflects, at least to some extent, the old Disneyland, pre-Rock culture, before we became sophisticated enought to expect more from film and television entertainment (Remember Sunday nights with those old Disney docu-movies on wildlife?). Nowadays, when those old wildlife films are occasionally rerun on TV, those too young to remember scoff and ridicule them, criticizing their lack of finesse. This is what I mean about a society too jaded to appreciate subtle, intelligent entertainment. We have allowed our corporations to de-sensitize and overly stimulate and sophisticate our children. Like I said, I always sensed something sinister about those corporation signs next to the Disneyland attractions.As far as Dinosaur is concerned, there were absolutely wonderful moments and sequences of this film. The introductory sequence is a marvel on the level of classic. This is, of course before the creatures start talking and the Rock beat starts playing. The scene where the Pterodactyl flies over the terrain is completely engrossing, so promising of something marvelous to come. But, as has been lamented over and again in this forum, that marvel never comes. Instead we get wise cracking monkey-mother-in-laws and other cheap dialogue.Still, there were a number of beautifully photographed/animated sequences sporadically presented throughout the movie. It was like there was a battle of priorities going on between the modern jaded mentality on one side, which apparently believes that it is responsible for presenting standard bad humor for kids, and the more seriously visual beauty that this marvelous new animation so obviously is demanding to be made in order to show us its gorgeous, shining self.In the end, it's an old Hollywood behind-the-scenes story revamped. Great sweeping cinematography with grandiose vistas a great Western (or in this case, a great pre-historic epic) make. But then we have to remember that this is still just Hollywood, where somebody's tasteless son-in-law is the executive producer (or something equivalent) and he says We gotta have humor in this picture!

The journey to safety is a time-tested plot element, but here it seems to lack the necessary epic quality and thus the payoff isn't very rewarding. (Oh. They reached the fabled valley. Seems like they only set off about a day and a half ago.) Still, the movie might have succeeded as eye candy even with these flaws, if not for one serious problem the character design. Take a photorealistic dinosaur, and then stick a rubbery, anthropomorphic face on it, and the result is jarring. Aladar's (and the other dinosaurs') small mouths, flexible lips, and front-set eyes looked really out of place. (In fact, I thought Aladar bore an unnerving resemblance to John Travolta in heavy makeup, and if I'd wanted to see that, I'd have gone to Battlefield Earth instead.) The type of caricature that looks fine in cel animation looks distractingly creepy in CGI. I flinched inside every time Aladar pursed his cow-like lips in thought.

And the opening scene leaves you breathless.  And the sound is great.  But...Dinosaur's greatest achievement, its animation, is also its greatest hindrance.  If the characters in this movie had been animated the old way, say like The Lion King, their completely anthropomorphized story would have been easier to get into.  But the animation is so photo-realistic that it pulls you in the direction of wanting to believe everything you see on the screen.  Meantime, the completely unreal story and characters (dinos that talk, have a sense of duty that overrides their sense of survival, etc.) keeps you constantly aware that you're watching a man-made fantasy.  The result is a short circuit, unintentional of course, but a short circuit nevertheless.One problem with buying into Dinosaur is the familiarity contemporary audiences have with animal behavior and with the history of dinos and the evolution of the earth in particular.  After 1,001 National Geographic shows on the subject, it is impossible to even remotely buy that any animal would risk their own survival to save a beast from a different group, or that different groups of animals would herd together, or that a dino who got beaten up by a bigger one will come out in his defense moments later out of a sense of duty.  But it's a fantasy, you say.  True, and it might have worked if the visuals had been unrealistic too, but somehow the fact that they aren't creates a kind of inconsistency that kills it.One more thing that doesn't help matters the story is poor and lacking in depth or originality.  Why, I wonder, would Disney invest so much money on a story that from the get-go must have reeked of predictability?  Well, it doesn't matter -- they'll make their money back and then some, and that's what matters to them.  One thing is for sure the great dinosaur movie has not been made yet.Got any ideas?

The plant eaters are the good guys.  The carnosaurs are the bad ones.  The good guys converse in happy-go-lucky dialect or philosophize over their respective plights.  Why do the meat eaters never talk?  They trumpet and growl, drool and chase.  They never stop to have a conversation.  Remember The Jungle Book with the tiger with the cold British accent.  His slyness and duplicity provided temptation.  There is too much chase in this movie.  The antagonists may as well be volcanoes or boulders or fire.  They have not personality, no evil volition, other than their stomachs.  The contemporary references, especially one to booking an airline flight seem strained.  Some are just for the sake of jokes--There's a monkey on my back. 	The other side would included the visual magnificence, the very realistic movements of the creatures, and the beautiful landscapes.  The first five minutes are wonderful.  I liked the contrasting of the meteor shower which starts out as a fireworks display and soon becomes close and violent. 	There is, of course, the quest for peace, the promised land.  Only the good dinosaurs are allowed in.  The getting there makes a fun ride with lots of action.  If only the characters had been a little more developed.  They are human, after all.

I was surprised to find that it was NOT a collaboration between Disney and Pixar; it is actually the work of an internal Disney department code-named The Secret Lab.What the Lab has cranked out is the most impressive piece of computer animation ever seen. Combined seamlessly with real backgrounds, the visuals were absolutely incredible. Of particular interest- The fly-by of a huge herd of dinosaurs is very impressive.- The falling meteors looked VERY good.- The lemurs' fur moves like REAL fur, in individual strands, not in clumps like most computer animated hair. CG buffs will appreciate the difficulty in achieving that effect.- The expressions on the characters' faces were surprisingly lifelike (especially on the lemurs, as they looked a little goofy on the dinosaurs).DON'T WAIT FOR IT TO COME OUT ON VIDEO! There is no way the small screen could ever do this movie justice.STORY Unfortunately, the story is the low point in the movie. It was very reminiscent of The Land Before Time; a group of dinosaurs flees the destruction caused by meteors in search of a safe location. There are some important issues addressed, such as the importance of compassion, in addition to the typical Disney friendship message.The PG rating is there for good reason; there are some big bad scary dinosaur scenes that are a bit too intense for very small children. It isn't terribly graphic or violent, just scary.SOUND The sound effects were well done and gave an immersive feel to the movie. One thing I really liked was the fact that the meteor impact, viewed from a distance, was silent until the sound wave arrived, a subtle touch that is often overlooked.MUSIC Viewers will likely be relieved that there are no singing, dancing dinosaurs. The stunning graphics were perfectly complimented by a fantastic soundtrack. I actually liked the music to Dinosaur more than that of Jurassic Park.Overall, I would recommend this movie to anyone, for the incredible computer graphics, if nothing else. If you're looking for a good story, you're likely to be disappointed, but the awesome visuals and sound make it worth watching.

Apparently the folks at Disney haven't realized that.  Yes, I enjoy realistic computer graphics, but if I want nothing but pure eye-candy I'll go see an IMAX movie.  Fantasia 2000 had a great deal of impressive graphics uncluttered by plot, but most people knew that going in.  I for one hadn't even realized they were going to make the dinosaurs talk.  (Or at least the herbivores... the carnivores seem to have been made less intelligent by default.  Unfortunately I don't have time for a debate on the political agendas of the film.)   I thought that perhaps Disney would do something akin to Homeward Bound, where the talking would be implied by voiceovers.  Instead we get a disturbing view of these photo-realistic creatures making facial expressions nature never intended... a decision that greatly lessened the believability for me.  I agree with others who make the comparisons to Land Before Time and A Bug's Life, though I must disagree with the Tarzan reference.  At no point do we really get the impression that Aladar (the main character) has been raised by lemurs.  In fact, if you removed the entire lemur element, you might even have a better movie.  (Though the hair was oh-so-impressive... except anytime something causes you to notice how impressive it is, it's probably stealing the scene more than it should.)Finally, I'd like to end my review by listing every major plot twist, surprise element, and original concept-----------  "},{"Title":"How can they be in the film if they are extinct?","Date":"29 May 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Family","Review":"  How can they be in the film if they are extinct?That is what a kid said, seeing dinosaur.

Some kids were had to stop watching the movie and turn around because they were afraid! It's not that the movie is too violent. (There is violence, but those are dinosaur!!!!) It is the way they show the Carnosaurs and the Velociraptors that is scary, in combination with the music.  Also, younger kids may have trouble to focus their interest on the movie because there is a lot of dialogue. My daughter that is used to see movies and usually watch them could stop moving the whole representation.So it's a good child movie for 6 year old and older.

We went to this movie knowing that many people had said that it was Land Before Time crossed with Jurassic Park but we went anyway. Good thing, too! This movie was great! Unlike so many Disney movies (and, incidentally, the LBT movies) there are no scenes where the characters sing! Woohoo! That alone puts it ahead of LBT. Second, the plots really aren't that similar. Finding your way home is a major theme in a LOT of literature/film/etc throughout history; people ragging on Disney for not being original are just, in my opinion, jumping on the slam the movie bandwagon.The Land Before time movies follow a bunch of children through learning about friendship via facing this and that adventure. The characters in Dinosaur (primarily adult characters) learn about friendship also, but then that is a theme in almost every movie ever made. They also learn to question tradition in favor of new ideas, helping and teamwork, and a lot of other stuff that is just good kids' movie values.I agree that some children might be scared by parts of the movie. My son wasn't, he loved the whole thing and wanted to see it again... but he's pretty fearless.

The basic premise of the movie is of an orphaned dinosaur leading both mammals and reptiles to the promised land, in terms of both a physical location and a state of mind. In getting to the promised land the movie manages to challenge Darwinian evolutionary theory, posit that vegetarianism is preferable to being a carnivore, suggest that reptiles are inferior to mammals, and challenge strong leadership.The key conflict in the movie is between the lead character, Alladar, and Cron, the old leader of the herd. This conflict is based on whether the weak should be left behind for the good of the herd. This is, of course, a cornerstone of evolution - the strong survive and pass on their genetic code, and weak genes get removed from the pool over the course of time. Alladar shows compassion and in saving stragglers perhaps changes the mindset of the herd (a nature versus nurture argument perhaps?)A further conflict was carnivor versus herbivore. Of course, this was played out on screen as the herbivore herd was pursued by assorted carnivores, but it was also part of the agenda of the movie, which was unashamedly pro-vegetarian. At the start of the film Alladar's adoptive lemur parents say Don't worry, we'll teach him to hate meat. As Alladar is a herbivore, this turns out to be uneccesary, but it is unusual in a Disney movie to hear such a strong statement from a good guy character. Whilst it is not surprising for the herbivore herd and lemurs to fear carnivores the film does manage to portray meat-eaters as the evil bad guys who must be destroyed.Whilst the carnivores are portrayed as the bad guys, reptiles in general are also consistently portrayed as being inferior to the lemurs. One can assume that Alladar's characteristic of compassion and teamwork is a direct product of his upbringing by lemurs (another nature versus nurture example). When we meet the herd they are portrayed as the blind followers of a dispassionate leader (Cron). At one stage even the weak who themselves are being left behind suggest that a wounded dinosaur should be left to the pursuing carnivors. As the film progresses, Alladar convinces first the stragglers and then the rest of the herd that compassion and teamwork are the way forward and that therefore the old reptilian way of thinking is inferior. Without this compassion and teamwork the herd would not have reached the promised land.It is unusual to see a Disney movie with such a strong agenda. Standard Disney fare does stress the importance of family and friendship, and is some respects Dinosaur is no different, although the battle between the young Alladar and old Cron can perhaps be seen to be a challenge to parental authority. The pro-vegetarian standpoint is also an interesting one, as is the attempt to suggest that some of the principles of evolution are undesirable. Whilst I don't have a problem with the politics of the film (I can make my own mind up about these things, and everyone is entitled to express their opinion) you may well have. Anyone with young kids knows that they tend to watch Disney films on permanent rotation and as such this film (like other Disney films) will have an impact on their world view, so don't be surprised if your kids become vegetarian and start arguing about evolution!I did actually like this film, although it really isn't one for an adult audience - it certainly is not Toy Story 2 (which I think I enjoyed more than most of the kids in the cinema!). The animation is superb, as is the soundtrack. It is visually stunning although I feel it would have benefited from being 2.351 wide rather than what appeared to be 1.851. I did go into the film with high expectations, primarily because it was an exclusive test-screening (apparently it was the only one they were conducting, and the print was specially flown in for the occasion under tight security). The film certainly didn't live up to my expectations, although from my comments it obviously has made me think quite deeply about what it was trying to say. If you're an animation/CG fan go and see it, but don't expect to be captivated by the story. As I said, however, the kids will love it...

In the first five minutes of Dinosaur, Disney tries to impress us by showing everything they can do with their computer generated effects.  And let's face it, that's the only reason we saw this movie in the first place (at least those of us without kids).But it's not the special effects that make a great special effects movie, and in the long run, Dinosaur will be forgotten among such landmark films as 2001  A Space Odyssey, Star Wars, Jurassic Park, and Toy Story. These movies combined creative ideas with special effects, and are now lodged in our cultural memory.Dinosaur exhibits no creative thought.  It's pretty much the same story as The Land Before Time, only this go-round we're dealing with digital dinosaurs.  Beyond being unoriginal, the story is weak  it's about a herd of dinosaurs trying to find their nesting area.  Everything that happens along the way has been done before and done better.  Even the celebrity voices suck (D.B. Sweeney?).  Particularly bad is the comic relief, which comes in the form of horny, yet unattractive monkey (I know it sounds funny, but it never is).  The movie is oddly short (about 75-80 minutes), for which I suppose we should be thankful.One comment about the special effects  they're great, but are they any more realistic than Jurassic Park's dinosaurs?  Spielberg wanted to show us what dinosaurs actually looked like millions of years ago.  In Dinosaur, we see a bunch of generic dinosaurs who make ridiculous facial expressions. The monkeys also make crazy faces from time to time.  My point here is that while the animals certainly don't look like cartoons, they don't look realistic either.Bottom line  Dinosaur is as interesting and creative as its title. Most people won't like it, with the exception of kids who get caught up in the craziness.  Parents should note that this is not a traditional family movie (it's rated PG for violence).  Hopefully, in the next couple of years, studios will use the technology of Dinosaur to make quality movies that we'll enjoy after the first five minutes.

There are teeth jabbing out of the screen, snot, spit, blood and death and general dino violence going on throughout most of the picture.Some of the coolest sequences in the whole movie are the ones that were playing months before on the trailer.  So if you saw the trailer, you've already seen some of the best parts.Disney really blew it with this one.  Yes, the graphics are good. Perfectly good as in Computer Generated.  Its been done before and is becoming commonplace now.  You'd think they could've been a little more creative with the story - this is no Toy Story 1 or 2.  If you have seen any of the Land Before Time movies you have seen this story and all the characters in it. The music is OK but it can be summed up as Epic Fantasy Movie Music You've Heard Before and is completely forgettable.Our family of 5 gave this movie a 3 for OK special effects.  That's about it.  The kids say they'd rather watch Toy Story any day.  And that sums it up perfectly.

Choosing to have them speak was a trade-off characterization and story-telling doubtless became easier, but they lost a lot of the majesty and awe that the visuals inspire.

The story revolves about how this male dinosaur ended up in the care of a horde of monkeys and grew up in the jungles with them. (ecological nightmare?) Then some meteor shower came and destroyed their home so they were forced to migrate with this herd of other dinosaurs to some breeding grounds where it was untouched by the carnage. Sounds familiar? Yes. You saw it before in The Land before Time. They just didn't have monkeys in that movie. Good humor, great family fun but not for me, too much cliches (such as our hero wins the heart of the big baddie leader dinosaur's sister and it erupts to a jealous struggle for the brother or some bad tempered dinosaur finally realises his mistakes when he is injured and the only people to care for him are our hero and his company...) The movie also earned a PG rating instead of G. Why? I didn't think that any scenes were violent or top that effect.

Dinosaur tells the tale of an ambitious dinosaur named Aladar (voiced by D.B. Sweeney) who is plucked out of his mother's nest and carried off to some unsuspecting primates. As he grows he accepts the frisky primates as his family. Just as the yearly mating ritual begins, Aladar's surroundings are engulfed in a cosmic event forcing Aladar to scoop up his adopted family and flee the safety of their island. Returning to the real world proves a challenge for Aladar and his adopted primate family as they try so hard to fit in with a huge migrating herd. Dinosaur's amazing visuals and breath-taking scenery shots hold you breathless as you escape into a world completely fixated on the instinct of survival. What seems to be the fault associated with Dinosaur is the story and emotion associated with its characters. Sure when Disney creates animated characters our human emotions and actions are often placed into the hearts of the depicted characters but here it seems almost strange. Here we have photo realistic surroundings and characters trying to be lifted from dinosaur history books. A couple years back a breakthrough film called `The Land Before Time' embraced the idea of telling a dinosaur story using Disney-style animation. It was a marvelous accomplishment but here it's very weird. That very thing addresses some issues concerning what exactly is cartoon-violence and what is real to you and your child. Some scenes are vicious and profound as we watch Aladar's constant struggle for survival in an untamed world. Through these scenes we do have to wonder which particular audience was the film being aimed. I know for younger viewers the realism and the intensity in the art of survival may be too much to handle. It's hard to judge which exact child may cringe while another might be excited. Dinosaur has pushed the envelope in regards to how real we really want to get with animation. The plot elements that baffled me were during Aladar's communication with the huge titanic Brachiosaurus, Baylene (voiced by Joan Plowright). In the introduction scene to Baylene, she is a giant and Aladar is worried about being stepped on. But as he gets to know her she seems to shrink and not be that large at all. And to top it all off Aladar is able to fit Baylene, himself and three other dinosaurs in a cave. That must be some cave and how come the herd never could see a cave that huge? Sure I am being analytical on a family film but the film is trying for as much realism as necessary. Dinosaur is more convincing and real than the `Land Before Time' but no where near as family or sincere as that film. I think it tries to be family at one moment and too realistic the next.

The Land Before Time is one of my favorite movies, and it's more classic than Dino, but Dino is still a great dinosaur movie.The narration at the beginning sometimes the smallest thing can make the biggest changes of all is so true.James Newton Howard, whose other worthy music credits include King Kong, Batman Begins, The Village, Signs, Dante's Peak, and other good movie music, produces some of the best movie music I've ever heard from Dino, which music I can't see why anyone wouldn't like this music. JNH is becoming one of my favorite movie musicians along with the greats John Williams, Danny Elfman, and Alan Silvestri.The animation for Dino is very good. I don't know how many other movies have computer-animated characters on a live-action background, but the idea's good and the overlap of animation on live-action is almost seamless.Almost the only things I didn't like as much were three things First, the supporting characters of lemurs. They were nice characters, but don't quite fit in a dinosaur movie. They didn't bother me too much though. Second, I originally thought that the meteorite shower at the beginning would end the movie with the end of the dinosaurs. Third, there were some themes that didn't quite fit in a kid's movie, such as courtship (the scene with the monkeys at the beginning) and life-and-death/sacrifice-and-survival situations. All of these errors were minor and overlookable.Dinosaur is actually one of my least favorite dinosaur movies (some other ones I'd rather recommend are The Land Before Time, Jurassic Park, and King Kong), but dinosaur movies fascinate me and almost always get an 8 or higher on my scale.

If it's Disney, and it's animated, I'm going to try my damnedest to try to avoid it, and most of the time, I'll succeed. Then comes Dinosaur. And it's Disney, and it's animated, and silly me, I went to go see it, and I wasted my time. From a technical standpoint, it was amazing. From a movie standpoint, it was just bad.Apparently the producers of Dinosaur were more interested in seeing what they could do with computer generated animation than making a movie people might actually enjoy. I mean, seeing what they could do with dinosaurs and other assorted creatures was cool for the first few minutes, but after that you look for a story that keeps you interested in what's happening on screen. The best example of that is of course Toy Story. Seeing these toys that we all used to play with when we were kids, come to life was incredible. But what made that movie great was the fact that there was a good story line, and characters that we cared about. In Dinosaur, I didn't care for any of the characters, and the story line seemed lifted from the Land Before Time series of films. Dinosaur follows a dinosaur named Aladar who is raised by some monkeys. When the meteors (or asteroids) that eventually end dinosaur life on Earth start to fall, all the dinosaurs must head to the nesting ground, where this is enough water and plant life for everyone. Along the way Aladar and his monkeys meet these other dinosaurs, who are lead by Kron. Kron and Aladar butt heads over how fast and how the group should be run. As well the group is being chased by other dinosaurs looking to kill them for food. In the end of course, Aladar is right and Kron isn't, and Aladar falls in love with Kron's sister. And they all live happily ever after. Other than the fact that their species will relatively soon be wiped off the planet. Like I said before, the detail the animators put into creating these dinosaurs are amazing. And I can appreciate the amount of work it took to make these creatures look so life like. But I wish they had created a story with characters we could connect with, and a story that was little more than a search for water. I never felt like I could care about any of the dinosaurs or the other creatures. Maybe it's because dinosaurs by nature aren't cute. Who doesn't love a cute creature? The entire movie had a cold feel to it. Lots of blues and greens, lots of dark skies and brooding characters. Only when everyone finally reaches the nesting ground does the movie start to look enjoyable. And by then it's over. As an aside, can I tell you how much I love Julianna Margulies? I've always loved her on ER (and am rightfully sad that she decided to leave the show) but even her voice is great. I'm ready to put her on my list of great animation voices along side of Michael J. Fox, Nathan Lane, and Robin Williams. Maybe that's another problem with my dislike of the characters, none of the voices was loveable enough (other than Julianna's). I suppose I'm being too hard on the movie. Creating something like this is an enormous task, and you have to cut corners somewhere. Put the money and effort into the animation, and let the story just happen. But in the end if you want people to go see your movie, there has to be something other than fancy imagery to keep the viewer involved. The initial amazement at the animation faded very quickly, and I found myself wondering when the movie was going to be over. There was just nothing else there to capture me. Maybe I went in expecting this to be like other Disney films, full of loveable characters, some cool songs, and a happy look and feel to the movie. But it had none of that. This was just an opportunity for Disney to test out their computer animation abilities. So overall Dinosaur was a technological masterpiece, but as a movie it was just so-so.

But I will give credit to Disney for attempting to broaden the frontier of CGI.Upon watching this film for a second time via the DVD, I found myself appreciating a couple of points in this film that I did not notice the first time I saw it in the theatre.   In some ways, these positive aspects of the film help to mitigate against some of the flaws.The first thing I realized is that there is a very good and counter-cultural message being sent about the value of elders and the need to look out for the weak and infirm.   The dinosaur Aladar, the lead charater in the film, makes it his business to look out for two elderly dinosaurs,  Baylene and Eema, who are having a difficult time keeping up with the herd as it treks through a harsh desert looking for the `promised land' (or Happy Valley - whatever allegory you prefer...)The unselfish attitude displayed by Aladar and the respect he shows the elder dinos is a wonderful message that you don't often see portrayed in recent Hollywood movies.   Aladar obviously sees value in these two elderly ladies, and does what he can to aid them in the long harsh journey to green pastures, even though it may put his own survival at risk.   It is interesting to see how the example he sets even goes so far to influence an old warrior igauandon named Bruton, who bravely and unselfishly gives his own life so that the old ones can survive.Another positive aspect of this film that really caught me off guard is how the Darwinian notion of `survival of the fittest' is shown in such an evil light, as it should be.   The leader of the herd of herbivores wandering through the wildnerness is a cold-blooded (pun very much intended) igaunadon named Kron, who is the very personification of `nature, red in tooth and claw.'   No, Kron isn't a carnivore, he's just a true believer in the tautology that states `the strong will survive' - and the weak serve as necessary sacrifices to the many predators that follow the herd like vultures circling a carcus.This repudiation of a central tennet of Darwinian lore is quite striking. No, `survial of the fittest' is not the best way to run things, not in the fictional world of Disney dinosaurs nor in the realm of human beings.   In a way, we have an inkling of the true basis for the creationist vs. evolutionist debate in the dinosaurs of Kron and Aladar.   Kron is the dyed-in-the-wool evolutionist wanting to just let nature run it's course (and perhaps even give it a helping hand...), and Aladar is the fundamental moralist who sees value in all of God's creation, even amongst the weak and infirm.  Think Mother Teresa vs. Adolf Hitler.I don't believe the writers of `Dinosuar' meant to portray some of the central aspecits of Darwinian evolution in a bad light, but the careful observer will note that Kron uses Darwinian ideas to justify his cold hearted leadership, much like some other cold hearted leaders that have come forth in the 20th century.Dinosaur's dinosaurs demonstrate to children the value of the elderly and those who are less fortunate, and the the need to come to their assistance. It also demonstrates the need to stand up to bullies-- to stand up for what is right even when facing overwhelming opposition.    Good lessons for children to learn.   The demonstration of the moral bankruptcy in using Darwinian evolution as a foundation for political leadership is also something that is good for children (and their parents) to know.

The makers of Dinosaur fail at even this opening decision.  This is an uncomfortable and clunky combination of a movie for serious dinosaur enthusiasts, and Disney pablum, and consequently, it works as neither.  It follows the Disney formula to a fault, leaving out only the saccharine-filled musical numbers.  Aladar's upbringing by lemurs is too cute by far to be followed up by the grim, colorless, depressing middle of the film.Part of the problem is that there are no rules here; fantasy needs rules, even talking-animal fantasy.  It's bad enough that it follows the age-old standard of herbivores good, carnivores evil, but in this case, the carnivores aren't even characters.  While the vegetarian herd speaks and interacts, the carnataurs are reduced to monsters who do nothing but chase and eat and roar.  Even among the herbivores, one of their number behaves like a dog instead of a person.  Is he mentally ill?Even on the technical level, it's problematic.  A decision should have been made early on will the dinosaurs talk or will they be realistic?  Doing both ruined whatever chance they had.  While we can accept talking animals in simple, line-drawn, iconic forms, the sight of a photorealistic dinosaur speaking is just clumsy.  I never felt fully comfortable with them in the way that something like The Lion King accomplishes.  Given their ultra-realistic bodies, I kept thinking that their jaws and lips shouldn't be moving like that.Hopefully, it's box-office failure will prevent any further thinking down this road.

I must admit my impression from the teaser was a bit better than the film actually turned out to be. Still, it is a good film, it uses ground-breaking techniques where animation is blended with real filming of locations around the world, and it pulls it off very effectively. Overall I rate it 7 of 10.Dinosaur is about an egg which is stolen by mainland creatures, dropped into a river, retrieved by a large bird, and finally dropped into a forest on a nearby island, where it falls amongst a family of lemurs, voiced in a style similar to the apes in Tarzan. The egg hatches and the baby dino, Aladar, grows up as a member of the lemur family, and calls the older lemur grandfather.A very large meteorite falls not too far away (effects, BTW, are terrific) and the shock wave and fires basically destroy the island and its inhabitants. Except for Aladar and his immediate lemur family. With fire at his tail, he jumps off a cliff into the water, with lemurs on his back. They eventually make their way to the mainland, and encounter a large mass of dinosaurs heading for the nesting grounds. It is a long, difficult trip across a desert and not all make it. Between flesh-eating dinosaurs and drought, Aladar does a couple of things that anger the leader but helps the masses. One is his discovery of water beneath the dry lake bed. Another is his discovery of a cave that leads to the valley paradise, as the old entrance has been closed by a great landslide. He eventually convinces the others to follow him, as the leader dies after a fight with a bad dino.They get to the valley, nest, have little dinos, Aladar ends up being the new leader of the pack and is married to the sister of the old leader. And, the film ends with a monologue about hoping that their existence will have some positive effect on the future. Sounds a bit like they had this terrific film but didn't quite know how to end it.I'm not totally sure how to take this film. On the one hand you have barbaric old dinosaurs who operate like a mafia boss with his sidemen, with absolutely no concern for others around them, yet they all speak with perfect modern English. As does Aladar, the lemurs, and all the other characters.  Which is fine if you are making a light comedy, but doesn't, for me, work so well with a more serious animated film like this one is. Unlike Chicken Run, A Bug's Life, Tarzan (animated), all of which I will watch periodically and enjoy, Dinosaur does not have that same compelling allure.  It is a good film, I found it totally worth watching, but there isn't much charm there to think back upon.The DVD has both DTS and Dolby surround tracks selectable. I watched several scenes in both modes, where there was a lot of sound, and in each case I found the Dolby Digital 5.1 sound to be more pleasing, fuller,slightly more aggressive, with better low bass. The picture, of course, is fabulous. The extras on the basic DVD (sells for about $20) are spartan, but the making of and the dinosar tutorial are both very interesting.

Characters are established early and the story moves neatly along given the personalities and events. But beyond that, Dinosaur works on another level that was heralded with the visual of the meteor that precipitated the environmental crisis that drives the main action of the movie.Dinosaur is clearly an allegory for Christianity. The meteor represents the Star of Bethlehem. The monkeys, who represent Christianity, teach Aladar to care for others , especially the elderly and infirm. That philosophy guides all of his behavior as he comes into conflict with Kron. To be successful, Aladar must overthrow the old (Roman) order of domination and brute force.The irony is that Aladar is biologically of the older order. The monkeys, who are reduced to bits parts in the second half of the movie, represent all mammals. And we know that as the dinosaurs pass away, the mammals will rise to ascendancy. Just as the Roman order passed away and Christianity ascended.As for comparisons with the saccharine Land Before Time, yes, there are plot similarities, but the affects, the rich sub-text, the music and the pacing of Dinosaur put it in a league Bluth can only dream about.I recommend it highly.

I was actually moderately entertained by it. I saw it because of the eye candy (and, at 82 minutes, I figured that, even if it was awful, I could last through it).I was expecting an awful script with awful voice actors spouting awful lines. That prejudgement was only 50% true. The script wasn't awful, but it wasn't very good either. It was a lot like The Land Before Time without the compelling characters and adventure. I really liked that movie. It was a movie that I (sort of) grew up on (I think it came out when I was 10). There are even some shots in _Dinosaur_ that seemed directly taken from The Land Before Time.The one thing that I was entirely correct about was the dialogue. Whew! It stank. The jokes were especially at fault. The many children in the audience very rarely laughed. I think one kid laughed at the awfully silly word jerkasaurus. No one laughed at the Love Monkey joke, no one laughed at the obligatory I've got a monkey on my back joke. Luckily, the comic lines weren't that great in number. And there was only one lemur who was meant to be comical. Actually, the lemurs were the most interesting characters. Their designs and their characters were the most interesting in the film.Anyway, to sum up, you might want to see this in the theater because of the animation. It is truly remarkable. I don't think that dinosaurs work particularly well with it. The way they look when they make human gestures and facial expressions is kind of stupid. Disney wanted Dinosaurs simply because they're a perpetual source of interest for young children. Most of the kids who will really enjoy this movie have grown up after the Jurassic Park era. Dinosaur toys will be extremely easy to market. In fact, my favorite part of this movie was when the little kid across the aisle shouted Look Daddy! I have that toy! It's Pleo! (if you are an adult, you should wait to see this movie at a 900 PM show, because kids talk all through movies nowadays; don't parents teach their kids that this is rude anymore? I never was allowed to talk during movies when I was that young). This film might be a preview of the future of the computer animated movies, e.g., the Final Fantasy movie that will open next summer.

Either way, by trying to have it both ways, `Dinosaur' emerges as an uncomfortable mix of National Geographic realism and storybook schmaltziness.  By now, we have all pretty much accepted the rather appalling sentimentalizing of nature that has become standard practice in virtually all mainstream animated films these days.  We are used to seeing compassionate lions, tigers and bears in such films, but maybe dinosaurs should really be considered off limits.  Of course, `Dinosaur' does feature some `bad' dinosaurs &#150; i.e. those who act according to their real nature &#150; because, like all dramatic works, it needs someone to function as a villain.  But when we find a bunch of furry pre-monkey type creatures befriending and then rearing a lost baby dinosaur into adulthood &#150; and when we find that grown up dinosaur acting as baby sitter and playmate to the children of that mammal tribe &#150; well, something tells us that we are going to be in for a rather sticky time for the duration of the movie.  (Think of this as `Tarzan' 65 million years earlier).  Ask not, for instance, what this carnivorous creature has been feasting on all these years to have reached its present size.  That piece of information is conveniently left to our imaginations, I guess.  The plot involves the trek to a fabled nesting ground that a group of dinosaurs (and a family of nondescript simians) must endure after an asteroid crashes onto earth destroying their living areas.  Despite some vicious attacks by predator dinosaurs, the tone of the film is decidedly gooey and sentimental, with the cloying voices in particular contributing to the bathos.  With their big sad eyes, mile-wide smiles and sunny dispositions, these dinosaurs register high on the sappiness meter.  We want to let out a big `ahhhhh, isn't that cute!' every time one of them speaks or looks directly into the camera.As this is obviously a film aimed at children and families, I guess many of these criticisms are rendered moot in the long run.  And, yes, the computer-generated effects are truly remarkable (though nothing we haven't already seen in the `Jurassic Park' movies).  But as an adult writing for adults, I cannot say anything other than that this is a pretty dull movie overall.  Show it to your kids if you must, but you may want to sneak another peak at `Jurassic Park' after they've gone to bed.

Because as a movie it doesn't hold up at all.The first mostly CGI-animated film - the backgrounds are mainly live-action - to be produced by Disney, it tells about a young iguanodon dinosaur named Aladar, who gets taken by predators, but eventually ends up on an island inhabited by a conspiracy of lemurs, which end up adopting and raising him. But then a meteor forces them out of their island and looking for a safe haven known simply as the Nesting Grounds. Along the way they meet other dinosaurs, get chased by predators, learn things about compassion and perseverance, et cetera, et cetera. If the plot sounds a lot like The Land Before Time mixed with some Tarzan, it's because it's exactly that. It's not trying to be subtle about it.Furthermore, it's a dull movie. None of the characters are all that defined beyond a characteristic or perhaps two, which means that you don't really care what happens to them. Though yes, there's Zini, the self-titled Love Doctor Monkey, but he's more annoying than anything else. The romance is supbar, Aladar's rivalry with Kron goes nowhere, the story barely has an arch and the ending climax doesn't feel like one, because the movie has barely set any stakes. Plus, it looks dull. Though the first act on the lemur island is actually not so bad. At least then we had colours. But as soon as they leave the island, it's nothing but shades of brown and grey for the rest of the film. I shall repeat that. Nothing but brown and grey. Nothing.To the film's credit, the actual animation has aged pretty well. Having the backgrounds be live-action helps a lot and the dinosaurs look mostly okay even still. The opening shot of Aladar's egg being carried around is very impressive and the lemur island part of the story is not so bad.I don't like that this is part of Disney animation canon. It was added retroactively in order to give Tangled the status as the 50th Disney animated classic, but it's an ill fit. Its story has no ambition, its characters are lackluster and all in all it's a very forgettable experience. It's everything a Disney classic should not be.

I rented it to watch for the first time about fourteen months ago, and by that point, I had been impressed by a good number of computer animated features, blown away by some, so I was hoping to find some good entertainment value in Dinosaur. However, I didn't really find it too entertaining during my first viewing, and it didn't leave me with the clearest memory I've ever had of a movie. A couple days ago, I rented it again, and thought maybe it would be better this time, but while it may have been just very SLIGHTLY better, it was still somewhat of a disappointment.A mother Iguanodon watches over her eggs, but unfortunately, after an attack, only one of them survives. This one egg is stolen and lost by a number of dinosaurs, but eventually ends up on an island inhabited by lemurs. Here, the egg soon hatches, and the baby Iguanodon comes out. At first, Yar, the elder lemur, is afraid that the dinosaur will become a dangerous predator to them when he grows up, but soon agrees to keep him. So, the dinosaur is named Aladar and raised by the lemurs on that island, and fortunately doesn't turn out to be a threat to them after all. However, a different threat awaits this island's inhabitants... a meteor shower! After this meteor shower hits, their island is destroyed, but Aladar manages to rescue his lemur family and take them across the water on his back. Searching for a new place to live, they soon join a herd of dinosaurs who have survived the meteor shower and are headed for the breeding grounds, but with predators, lack of water, and an oppressive leader, getting to their destination will be a challenge, and since Aladar was raised differently than the others in the herd, he may have trouble fitting in! The animation in this film is widely praised, and I'm certainly not complaining about that. The film sometimes uses live action backgrounds behind the realistic looking computer animated characters, which works. However, the amazing animation isn't enough to hide the movie's problems. I personally found quite a bit of it fairly boring. It may often get tedious (I was definitely bored at times), and most the characters, if not all of them, don't really stand out as very memorable. Also, while I did find some parts mildly amusing, I didn't usually find a lot of humour, and good humour is something I like to see in animated family movies. I did find some parts exciting, especially towards the end of the movie, with maybe some remotely touching moments as well, and the animation and music sometimes helped. I also have a clearer memory of it now that I've seen it a second time. Still, the film was a tad disappointing, and not one I would want to watch over and over again.After seeing Dinosaur twice, I still think that overall, it's just slightly above average, definitely not one of Disney's gems. I guess since this is a family movie, I should mention that there are some rather violent dinosaur fighting sequences, which some may criticize it for. Well, I guess that's why it's rated PG, and at least there's no blood in these sequences. That aside, while the appeal of this 2000 Disney flick isn't as wide as that of many other computer animated features (which I can understand), it seems that quite a few people like it more than I do, and even I think it's far from terrible, so saying avoid it like the plague would be a bit harsh, but I wouldn't expect it to be one of the computer animated classics, despite its memorably stunning animation, which seems to be what it's most widely praised for.

But the Xeroxed storyline is just the first of its problems.The animation, apart from some shimmering during the lemur courtship scene early on, is impressive - the digital characters blend perfectly with the live background footage that's used in some scenes - but the tale's lumbered with far too many bland characters, especially Alidar (the dullest main character in a Disney movie since Pocahontas). Compared to The Land Before Time's funny Petrie or loveable Ducky, this batch of critters almost totally fails to cut it; you can only admire fur or skin texture for so long before you want to consider the inhabitant, and find it lacking.There are some good moments to be had during the trek, and the movie gets a major assist from James Newton Howard's rousing Goldsmith-esque score (and no songs!), but in the end Dinosaur is but a lumbering behemoth which, like the real dinosaurs, hasn't got a life of its own.

Dinosaur tells the story of a large dino being raised by monkeys and then he and his monkey family join up with a lot of dinosaurs after the meteors hit and ravage dino-land.  There is no water or food to be found, and they all trek toward a breeding spot thought to be spared from the cataclysmic devastation.  Along the way, the dinos develop personalities(in typical Disney fashion), fight amongst themselves, a few die from the weary stress of life or in the jaws of rampaging carnivorous dinos, and a light romance befalls our main character(Big surprise!).Yes, the film is very realistic when it comes to dinosaur life and dino behaviours(talking not included).  The film has glorious animation and in its final form is quite enjoyable and entertaining.  Yet, I found myself a little disappointed.  I think Disney has just not been making the films they made so well in the early 90's like Aladin, Beauty and the Beast, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, The Lion King, or even The Little Mermaid.  Is their creative spark nearing being extinguished?  Much of this film is very derivative of other Disney films, characters, situations, and the film owes a huge debt, whether Disney thinks so or not, to Bluth and The Land Before Time.

However, I almost never see the animations on the movies, because they are released in Brazil on school vacations (July and December/January), when I go to my hometown in the country, where we don't have any cinemas since the middle of the '80s. But this year I was able to see two of them because I stayed a little longer. The first was the excellent Fantasia/2000 and the second was the bland Dinosaur. It's not a totally disappointing film, because I wasn't expecting much of it, but it is disappointing if compared to other animations.Is it a bad film? Not really. But it is also not good. It recalls me the live-action Disney flicks I've mentioned for its stupid story, one-dimensional characters and lack of dramaticity. So forget the depth of Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus in The Lion King or just the joilness of Aladdin and Toy Story. It's more for the emptyness of Pocahontas, definetely the worst thing Disney has done in the field of animation. The story of Dinosaur gets stuck because it has nowhere to go. Actually, there's not a tight story. And that's a real problem. It seems that they forgot the screenplay to invest in the visuals. Now we get to what interests here the visuals. As the most expensive animation film ever, it had to have a good thing to hold the viewer's attention. And do you know what? The visuals are the only good reason to watch Dinosaur. It's not just amazing, not just jaw-dropping, not just incredible... It's impossible to describe how terrific those images are.But then we remember the weakness of the screenplay. Such wonderful images deserved a tight story, not something we've seen 1000 times over and dinosaurs talking nothing very valuable. That's why I can't recommend it enough.

Also, Disney decided to give the story a happy ending, even though it is common historical knowledge that none of the Dinosaurs survived.Even so, the movie might have actually been better had Disney decided to keep the songs out of the film for once. The Disney Animated Musical Numbers (DAMN) have gotten far too old, and frankly, the genre of the musical, animated or otherwise, has been soundly beaten to death by Disney. Of course, without the songs, the film would have been even shorter than its already short 70 minute run.In short, this film was colossal, a colossal waste of time, money and talent. Dinosaur should have been left extinct.If you really want to see a deeply detailed computer animated movie, I suggest you wait until the Summer of 2001, when Final Fantasy is released.

Plot Spoilers) After a Dinosaur egg is stolen and then dropped, re-stolen and then dropped some more by various clumsy prehistoric animals and mammals, it finally ends up in the hands of some adorable primates who raise it and love it as one of their own. Just when things couldn't be nicer for this family of mixed species, a nasty (albeit impressive) meteor storm all but obliterates their surroundings, forcing both Dinosaur and his furry family to join a herd of other Dinosaurs in finding a new home.THE REVIEW The first fifteen minutes of this film are jaw-droppingly beautiful. The animation is unlike anything we've ever seen, at least not since the original `Toy Story.' Mixed in with actual scenic cinematography, everything looks incredibly vivid and lifelike. I wanted to reach out and pet those cute-as-pie black and white primates, (all except the &#145;love monkey,' I was hoping a Brontosaurus would accidentally step on him. More about him later) and it looked like I practically could. So twelve years in production (or should I say in various offices and rooms loaded with sophisticated computer technology) and a budget exceeding two hundred million dollars, gets us a stunning looking animated film.That's all fine and dandy, but what about story, what about characters? I'm afraid that's where `Dinosaur' is a few bones short of a skeleton. There really isn't a story here, just a rehash of the much better `Land Before Time' and elements of Disney's `Tarzan,' all without songs of course. As for characters I wish Disney could find it in their hearts to give us one film WITHOUT some cute wisecracking creature. The one found here, the furry fella who calls himself the &#145;love monkey,' is as irritating as stepping barefoot on a hairball. Forget the fact that this primate spews bothersome dialogue that seems to be out-of-place in a family film and totally ignore the major writing blooper suggesting that these two species could find themselves existing in the same time period, the fact is the mere presence of him and his family is just ridiculous in a story that is supposed to be about Dinosaurs and survival. It wouldn't have been so bad if the non-Dinosaur characters would have been &#145;seen and not heard' but this is a Disney film and there's millions to be made in plastic and furry renditions of these characters, so words are vital I guess, no matter how stupid they ultimately are.Oh I know...lighten up Tom...this is a kids movie...not Bergman. However I cannot totally agree that this is just a kids film. There are a few scenes in this film (closely resembling some of the more intense moments from `Jurassic Park') that frightened some young children in the audience I sat in with, those that weren't bored by the whole affair that is. As I got out of my seat I noticed a little guy of about five who was sound asleep in his mom's lap. I would have loved to have a picture of that. I would send it along with a video of the little girl two rows in back of me who began screaming as a T-Rex attacked and quickly devoured one of the gentler Dinosaurs in the movie... to all those Disney folks 'so proud of their ultra-expensive &#145;family' movie.Also absent here is emotion and a sense of wonderment. There is one segment in `Jurassic Park,` the one in which the plant-eating Dinosaurs visit the children in the pre-dawn hours, that holds more wonderment than `Dinosaur' does as a whole. As much as I absolutely hated the cutesy-pie dialogue in this film and felt so disappointed at the lack of a good story and the fact that too much of time is spent on non-Dinosaur characters, I cannot say enough for the visuals to be found in `Dinosaur.' Just looking at this film, for the first half-hour at least, is worth the price of admission alone. This film simply sets a new precedent for animation. James Newton Howard's score, pretty much a clone of everything done by James Horner, (especially `Land Before Time') is excellent as well. So it&#145;s a mixed reaction to this movie. I am saddened that a film that looks so fantastic could be so lacking in almost every other department. See it for it's 'look' and the score alone.

The dialogue of this film was surprisingly flat, the characters uninteresting, and the overall scenario pretty mediocre. Yes, it was pretty, but then as now, that means next to nothing to me. I had no interest in the protagonist throughout the film, caring more about getting a refill of Coke then what was actually happening on the screen.This was Disney-Pixar's one dangerous encounter with George Lucas syndrome, taking a good formula and botching it up, touting the effects rather than the story.

On top of that, the animators took the time to make *really interesting shots* that would be difficult to emulate with cels (i.e. the reflection of Buzz's face on the inside of his helmet) instead of just trying to save time and money (as in the train sequence in Anastasia).The opening of Dinosaurs was pretty astounding, but in hindsight, it was way way too quick and was reliant on about a hundred separate coincidences to get the egg where it was going--it was like the attack sequence in Bay's awful Pearl Harbor.  Then the meteor thing was real flashy, too.  After that, it's not much better than The Land Before Time.Once everyone starts talking, though, the real weakness of this movie appears.  I swear, the script must have been written by a twelve year old hippie, ignorant of any patterns of speech but his own (You need a little help from the love monkey) and ignorant of the true nature of nature (the kind of naive belief that saving a cute species is helping nature, with no regard to the wisdom of the kind of laissez-faire environmentalism that would kick all the tourists out of Yellowstone and other nature preserves so that we as humans would truly respect nature by protecting it from ourselves).  A reviewer (I think it was Roger Ebert) pointed out the basic paradox of having dinosaurs preach against survival of the fittest, since (life spoiler) they all died off about 64,000,000 years ago.

The script is just too dreadful, and the plot is dull.  It looks great, but that just isn't enough.When I went to see Toy Story 2 the entire opening sequence of Dinosaur played.  It looked marvelous, and I couldn't wait to see the film.  But as soon as the dialogue started the film just lost it.  I think the film could have been better without any dialogue at all.How can Disney have got it so right with Toy Stories 1 and 2, and so wrong with Dinosaur?  It looked so promising in the preview.  The mid-90s TV show of the same name had more subtlety and more complex plots.Don't waste your money, unless you have a very small child to entertain.

So crappy was it, that I couldn't even bother to be amazed at the CGI; in fact I saw this film as an immense waste of technology.First off, I HATED the fact that these realistic dinosaurs and quasi-realistic primates spoke and all but acted like humans. It's one thing to have traditional 2D animated characters speak or even a 3D animal talk in a live-action fable but to have astoundingly realistic creatures have such horribly anthropomorphic qualities in a realistic setting is very jarring, especially when the dialog is so 'cute' and anachronistic.Secondly, the story mimicked the superior Land Before Time. Let me state I don't think Land Before Time (the 1st one) was a masterpiece, but for what it was, a charming story mostly aimed at the younger crowd, it was successful. Dinosaur tells practically the same story, but with boring characters.

So why is this one of the more interminably dull Disney releases I've seen? For the most part, the film plods at a snail's pace, with little but the first-rate dinosaur animation to keep things afloat.The movie does get off to a breathtaking start, as it features an egg that goes through series of mishaps and adventures before it finally ends up in the hands of a monkey colony. The egg turns out to be a dino (looks like an iguanadon, the ones with those pointy thumbs) who is cared for and raised by the monkeys. He is named Aladar and this perfect life of his with the monkeys comes to a complete halt when an asteroid strikes the vicinity, destroying their home, forcing all the animals in the area to search for new land. Through the journey, they must brave the dangers of the carnivorous raptors and carnotaurs to reach paradise.In case you haven't noticed, the plot closely resembles The Land Before Time, so much so I wonder what Don Bluth would think if he ever saw this movie (or maybe he already has). There's one crucial element that separates Dinosaur from The Land Before Time, and that's the fact that TLBT was at least kind of fun. It gave us a genuine dilemma, a few slighty memorable characters, and a terrific score from James Horner.My appreciation for Dinosaur, however, is entirely on a visual level. The folks at Disney have done a marvelous job of crafting these ancient creatures and rendering them to life. It's dynamic work, but as visually stunning as these creations are to look at, listening to them is another story. The voicing is subpar, and even worse, the characters are completely lifeless. Disney's animated offerings usually give us at least one or two memorable characters per film; this one features a grand total of zilch. Only this movie and Tarzan can lay claim to that dubious statement.Probably the worst decision from the filmmakers was to set the majority of the movie in a desert wasteland. Here are all these great, expensive CGI visuals, and they end up getting dumped in a thoroughly drab, unimaginative setting that does little to spark or fuel the imagination. There's no sense of wonder, no awe, no excitement, and most importantly, no fun. For great escapist entertainment with dinosaurs, stick with Jurassic Park.

Sure, the first few minutes, including a spectacular flight on the back of a pteradon, had me dazzled.  I was glued.  And then I was not.  This is not just a bad movie.Fault 1.  This is a boring movie.  Kids don't like to be bored, but they will with this one.  Yes, the first few minutes are set in a beautiful tropical landscape overflowing with amazing creatures.  Then the rest of the thing is set in a boring and utterly depressing desert.  If the execs at Disney wanted to flaunt CGI, couldn't they have found a more interesting backdrop.  A kid's movie should be anything but boring, right?Fault 2.  This is a violent movie.  I like violence in films.  It's often stimulating and always gets a reaction, but in a kids film, to see a cute little triceratops get pounced on by a giant monster and then watch as the innocent thing is torn to shreds is appalling in a film aimed at youngsters. And this incident is very soon in the film.  Then you see the aftermath of this one poor dinosaur all ripped apart, blood all over, barely alive from his ordeal.Fault 3.  This is a film with bad ethics/morals (apologies to Election). As has been stated numerous times, all those who eat meat are considered pure evil.  Vegetarians, that's mother nature's elect, I guess.  What happened to Mufasah explaining the circle of life?  And kids will no doubt be asking their parents to explain the mating ritual of the lemurs, which was supposed to be cute and mirror real life, but it explained nothing, just confused kids more about sex.  And then there's much hypocrisy concerning the moral of the story, about standing together and yet beeing a rebel when the occasion called for it.Fault 4.  This is a stolen film.  Not only was I constantly reminded of The Land Before Time, but I realized that I was just watching The Land Before Time, but gone were good characters and dazzling poetic backdrops.  All the plot points are identical, it's just that here, we don't care, largely due to the fact that Dinosaur is supposed to be realistic, which it is not (they talk), but the previous had characters which were kids.  The audience could relate.Parents, please do not buy this film for your kids.

One of my favorite movies is Alice in Wonderland (disney), and Aladdin has always been a favorite.  I enjoy family films, if they can entertain both adults and children alike.  This movie did not.  It was about the same as Inspector Gadget.  I walked out of that movie, and walked out of this movie, but had to go back in.  My friend was in there, and he hated it, but he wouldn't walk out.The movie itself has graphics that are good and bad at the same time.  You can tell that the backgrounds are Kodak Digital stock, and that they are real.  The dinosaurs don't belong in it.  I didn't notice any inaccuracies, but that was because I was never really interested in Dinosaurs to begin with.  The graphics were ok, but i have seen better.  Maybe IMAX's dinosaur movie has better graphics, who knows?The plot of the movie is The Land Before Time.  It also reeks of The Lion King, and many other established cliches.  The end death is straight out of the Lion King, so much that I was waiting for the new baby to be held up against the background, and in essence, that is what happened.  The worst part about the movie was the dinosaurs showed emotions and human traits after a very realistic-type start.  I was so aggravated, I wanted to say pick a style realism or bad.  It chose bad.  The first 15 or 20 minutes (just before the dinosaurs start talking) are great, but it is all downhill from there.

With years in development and an entire studio of technology built to make it, Dinosaur comes off as a flat, boring, standard-issue Disney animated film that just looks better than it's predecessors.  To call its plot standard-issue Disney is almost giving it too much credit.  All the basic elements are here but Dinosaur's script is so patch worked together from other Disney films that it has no personality of its own.  It's just a collection of repeated Disney themes.  Making things worse is the film's tendency to undermine what little drama there is.  Part of the film involves following a heard of dinosaurs across the newly scorched landscape to where water should be awaiting them.  They get there and find no water.  Our hero discovers that the water lies just under the surface, everyone rejoices and drinks.  The next day it rains.  The film continues on in this backwards manner.  There are two ill-tempered dinosaurs leading the pack and all for leaving behind the weaker ones to be picked off by following predators.  The film's persistent and somewhat annoying message of teamwork should have the most impact on these contrary attitudes.  Instead, enlightenment is granted to one of the two, quickly followed by his death which renders the whole gesture pointless.Is there anything worthwhile here?  The visuals are astounding, but in this day and age of constant one-upsmanship in the field of cinematic CGI, one can't help but feel a tad flippant about the whole thing.  James Newton Howard provides a score that is at times interesting, the dinos don't sing thank God, but too often proves derivative of The Lion King.  The voice work is unimpressive all around and adding ethnic undercurrents to each personality was a bad idea.  The whole idea of voicing these characters further proves the film's determination to undermine itself.  Create the most visually real dinosaur film you can possibly imagine, and then make the dinos talk and throw in modern references for good measure.  The Disney machine needs a serious overhaul, now.

On the dramatic level, all Disney movies are held to generously lower standards and praised as masterpieces. Why, I can't imagine. It's just Disney, says everyone. You shouldn't expect a great script, the movie will be great anyway!Material tailored to children will naturally have a vast adult audience--parents unfortunate enough to have kids who beg them to take the family out to see movies like these--so why not make something that adults can appreciate? That aside, I insist that the enormity of an unredeemably bad screenplay (Disney seems to have a patent on these) should not be dismissed simply because the movie is for children.I say all this because Dinosaur is a horrible moviegoing experience in so many ways that it is probably considered torture in some parts of the world. For the life of me, I cannot see why everyone was so impressed by the visuals. The opening sequence, called breathtaking by many, is a ludicrous rehash of the far better opening of Forrest Gump. The graphics are unrealistic, the characters' faces way beyond cartoony with hideous human tics and gestures. Why was everyone so convinced and drawn in by the artistry of the film that they were snapped out of a stupor when the animals started to speak? I just don't get it.Perhaps the disappointment of hearing the dinosaurs and the lemurs talk stemmed from the fact that the dialogue with which Dinosaur tortures us for eighty minutes is so bad, it makes the Godzilla screenplay look like that of L.A. Confidential. Yeah, I said it! And I meant it.To begin, I was never impressed or convinced by the visuals. The blending of ridiculous, excessively cartoony computer models with live-action scenery was anything but seamless. But in comparison with the dialogue, the sights were near masterful. The plot is unoriginal. In fact, it's plain done to death. Disney fanatics, of course, package this phenomenon of recycled garbage as tried and true or a new twist on a classic theme. Fair enough, except it's an old twist on a classic theme. Several classic themes, actually. The movie raises several ideas and just throws them in briefly, giving each the spotlight for a few minutes without dealing with a single one, then retreating back to the search for that darned mysterious valley. Issues are raised not to be resolved, but to interrupt the progress of the plot (possibly to eat up time, because the movie would otherwise have seemed too short, even though it feels too long).There's that theme of the rivals, the new kid on the block versus the hard-hearted, iron-fisted leader of the pack. Then there's the romance issue, which never goes anywhere (hey, they're dinosaurs, not humans!). And the individualistic ideals raised by our hero as a humanistic thorn in the side of fearless leader's Darwinian methods. That's always good for a laugh. Not here, though. Dinosaur is the worst kind of bad movie. Not like Mortal Kombat Annihilation, where it's so ridiculous that it's entertaining, literally laughable. This, I couldn't laugh at. It was just too painful.And of course, in grand tradition, the carnivores are demonized and denied speech, which all herbivores are granted. It's the way Hollywood always cements the message that all meat-eaters are monsters from the depths of you-know-where. Nothing like a subtle touch. Interesting, though, that here the predators (carnotaurs, a real but little-known dinosaur) deliver in their roars a kind of dialogue more worth hearing than that of the veggiesaurs. I tell you, the script is BAD! And it really kills the whole movie, for those of us who didn't already find the look of the movie unappealing.No children's movie is complete without the obligatory scene where the hero defeats the villain in a thoroughly implausible action sequence. Convenient that a solid rock footing would crumble to dust just when the bad guy steps on it, no? This movie takes what was passable in The Land Before Time (better by far) and makes it uniformly bad, copying everything and filtering out whatever had any charm, imagination, or credibility. With a never-ending parade of STUPID one-liners, Dinosaur is so bad that it almost seems like the product of a collaborative decision to make it stink.For me, a movie is only as good as its script. Complaints of implausibility (a big problem here) die out where the drama is appealing or the action entertaining, two ideal strokes of luck facilitated in the first place by the words on the paper. No such luck with Dinosaur, a movie whose unjustifiably good B.O. performance seems to have legitimized the studios' free-spending habits. So much for imagination.

Dinosaur tells the tale of an ambitious dinosaur named Aladar (voiced by D.B. Sweeney) who is plucked out of his mother's nest and carried off to some unsuspecting primates. As he grows he accepts the frisky primates as his  family. Just as the yearly mating ritual begins, Aladar's surroundings are engulfed in a cosmic event forcing Aladar to scoop up his adopted family and flee the safety of their island. Returning to the real world proves a challenge for Aladar and his adopted primate family as they try so hard to fit in with a huge migrating herd. Dinosaur's amazing visuals and breath-taking scenery shots hold you breathless as you escape into a world completely fixated on the instinct of survival. What seems to be the fault associated with Dinosaur is the story and emotion associated with its characters. Sure when Disney creates animated characters our human emotions and actions are often placed into the hearts of the depicted characters but here it seems almost strange. Here we have photo realistic surroundings and characters trying to be lifted from dinosaur history books. A couple years back a breakthrough film called `The Land Before Time' embraced the idea of telling a dinosaur story using Disney-style animation. It was a marvelous accomplishment but here it's very weird. That very thing addresses some issues concerning what exactly is cartoon-violence and what is real to you and your child. Some scenes are vicious and profound as we watch Aladar's constant struggle for survival in an untamed world. Through these scenes we do have to wonder which particular audience was the film being aimed. I know for younger viewers the realism and the intensity in the art of survival may be too much to handle. It's hard to judge which exact child may cringe while another might be excited. Dinosaur has pushed the envelope in regards to how real we really want to get with animation. The plot elements that baffled me were during Aladar's communication with the huge titanic Brachiosaurus, Baylene (voiced by Joan Plowright). In the introduction scene to Baylene, she is a giant and Aladar is worried about being stepped on. But as he gets to know her she seems to shrink and not be that large at all. And to top it all off Aladar is able to fit Baylene, himself and three other dinosaurs in a cave. That must be some cave and how come the herd never could see a cave that huge? Sure I am being analytical on a family film but the film is trying for as much realism as necessary. Dinosaur is more convincing and real than the `Land Before Time' but no where near as family or sincere as that film. I think it tries to be family at one moment and too realistic the next. (3 of 5) So Says the Soothsayer.  "},{"Title":"Pretend Characters, Real Fabric","Date":"9 June 2000","Score":"1 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Family","Review":"  Since the beginning of film, the art form has been captive of the phenomenon of celebrity. So we often have the situation of characters in the play which are dissonant from the setting, the rest of the film. In addition to being integrated into the film story as characters, they are simultaneously integrated into a `real life' drama where they serve as archetypes, as larger characters in the greater play of life.The celebrity of the archetypes is largely manufactured, and in any case driven by dark forces in the unconscious, which makes them less real. But the magic of film is that the illusion of reality in placing the viewer at the scene is independent of this and extremely powerful.Thus, the normal situation in film is that the characters are less `real' than the overall fabric of the film and most of its parts -- when Charlton Heston plays a minor role in Hamlet, we see the character's role (a poor actor), and the real person (also a poor actor), plus all sorts of extra semiotic dimensions (gun thug, cartoon Moses ...). In that particular case, the director deliberately played on the illusion that the character was less real than the play, which itself wells realism.The mix of animation and `real' photography offers exaggerations on this reality. Roger Rabbit and the Mask were interesting not because they were even good entertainment, but because they captivated by playing on this dissonance.Now we have another dinosaur movie with no intrinsic value. The animals in this film are impressive in our day as Spielberg's were in their era, and even his shark before that. Next year, new magic will eclipse these renderings as well. But what we have here is a positively mundane film that still fascinates. And the reason is this dissonance again.For those who don't know, the characters are modern 3-d cartoons, made on a computer. But they are placed (mostly) in films of real scenes, taken from around the world a first in terms of a whole film (and lack of real creatures as a reference). And in a homeopathic increase, the more real the creatures look, the greater the dissonance between foreground and background. Utterly fascinating.A sad point on viewing. Most kiddie movies should be seen in a theater of kids since they carry the visceral flow of the petty drama and surround you with juvenile commitment. Don't bother here. There is no connection with kids' fantasies.  "}]
