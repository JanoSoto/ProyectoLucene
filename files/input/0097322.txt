[{"Title":"The Real Seattle Sound","Date":"24 July 2000","Score":"67 out of 68 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Music, Romance","Review":"  Written and directed by Steve Kloves, `The Fabulous Baker Boys' is a tale of music and brotherly love set in Seattle.  The Baker boys are Jack and Frank (real life brothers Jeff and Beau Bridges), who eke out a living playing piano together at various venues throughout the Emerald City, a basic lounge act they've been doing for fifteen years.  Frank is the responsible one, because he has to be; he has a wife, kids and a home in the suburbs.  He manages their business, secures the bookings and is content to stick with a formula that works.  For him, it's not about the music, it's about keeping food on the table for those who depend on him.  Jack, on the other hand, is unattached and could care less about the business end of the partnership.  As long as it affords him a modicum of security as well as dignity, he is more than willing to just go along for the ride. 	For Jack, though, underneath it all, it is about the music; it's about jazz.  On off nights he will steal away alone to some small club to play, and deep down inside he knows that this is not only what he really wants, but needs.  And he knows he could be great, if only he'd let himself go.  The trouble is, he's been with Frank his whole life, and as long as the act is working he just can't make the break.  Unless something happens, his dreams are destined to remain suppressed and unrealized. 	It is only when one of their regular clubs balks at rescheduling them that the brothers begin to realize that perhaps their act is getting a bit stale.  So they decide to try adding a singer to the act.  After a memorable scene in which a number of young hopefuls are auditioned, Suzie Diamond (Michelle Pfeiffer) enters their life.  She joins the act on a trial basis, and after an amusing and somewhat tentative beginning, infuses it with new life, though Frank continues to adamantly resist too much of a departure from their original show.  (`Does anyone really want to hear &#145;Feelings' again?' she asks him at one point).  Ultimately, however, Suzie becomes the impetus for change that Jack has needed all along, and the stage is set for the decisive moment, which comes when the dignity of the brothers is compromised due to an incident on Frank's part of uncharacteristic carelessness.  When Jack tells Frank, `We've never been clowns before&#150;' you know exactly how deep it has cut.   	Kloves has fashioned an entertaining study of relationships, change, and the effects of complacent loyalty and self-denial; and the importance of following your own heart.  When Jack sits down alone at the piano in that smoke-filled club, we know that this is where he is meant to be.  Filmed on location in and around Seattle, with a terrific score by Dave Grusin,a supporting cast that includes Jennifer Tilly (Monica) and Ellie Raab (Nina), and a classic scene in which Suzie Diamond croons `Makin' Whoopee' atop a piano, `The Fabulous Baker Boys' is an absolute gem you do not want to miss.  I rate this one 10/10.

It's not the first time real-life brothers have played fictitious brothers in a movie (in fact, in The Long Riders several famous siblings paired up to similar effect). However, The Fabulous Baker Boys really benefits from the pairing. The sibling rivalry that runs through this film feels very credible and very convincing, possibly because Jeff and Beau aren't really acting but are simply using their real-life love/hate brotherly attitudes to fuel their performances in front of the cameras. It's a fairly thin story, but well told. Jack Baker (Jeff B.) and Frank Baker (Beau B.) have spent years working together as stage pianists in various bars, hotels and night-clubs around Seattle. Their long-running act begins to run out of steam and they find themselves playing to empty rooms.... even their more established employers begin to express doubts about their ability to pull in the big crowds. They decide to hire a female vocalist to spice up the appeal of their show and, after over thirty awful applicants, they finally unearth a winner in the shape of Suzy Diamond (Michelle Pfeiffer). Initially, Suzy provides them with a turn in their fortunes, but the future of the trio becomes cloudy when she and Jack develop sexual yearnings for each other. The problems don't stop there, with Frank and Jack slowly becoming more and more distant with each other as their views on how best to market their musical talents are revealed to be very different. The Fabulous Baker Boys is extremely well-acted throughout, with Pfeiffer in particular giving an outstanding performance (she even sang most of her own songs). The main themes of sibling rivalry and unfulfilled talent are generally engrossing, and help to paper over the thinness of the story. Jeff acts rather moodily for much of the time and is very believable as a man working in the lower ranks of his trade when he could've reached the top. Beau is also in fine form as a performer who does what he does simply because it puts money in the family kitty. It's a hard film to describe, because it's not really about very much, but if you can adjust to the relaxed pace and just enjoy the leisurely development of the three main characters then you will come away from the film feeling thoroughly satisfied.

It is an important film because of the subject matter an expose of musical art married to entertainment. It is a subject rarely revealed in American media.Most people think of musical art as something found at the  classical music concert or the college music department. The other stuff we hear is entertainment, right? Well, sometimes it just isn't that simple. Baker Boys is a story based on those cases of mixed marriage when the talented artist finds himself locked into an employment situation that hampers his artistic ability. It may come as a surprise to Jazz and commercial music lovers that such music artists really do exist beneath the glamorous facade of their favorite music acts (not to mention films). The story of Jack Baker means to reveal this dark underbelly of the entertainment business.It is well for the public to understand how and why such musicians exist. The distribution of a film such as Baker Boys is but one step toward this end. While most people saw the film as a romance involving the swing music genre, what they didn't seem to recognize is the more important underlying contextual theme. This issue - of undiscovered musical talent - is not popular. Unfortunately the average layperson is not familiar enough with music to understand or care about why a musician would be unhappy with his job. It is easy to see why most people avoided this, the main theme of the film - it's too dark - and instead focused on the romance and the style.In the end, Baker Boys is a story of one Jack Baker, an entertainer who was finally bold enough to make the transition to Jazz artist. It is a story of passive resistance to what Blake Edwards immortalized as that other part of the entertainment industry known behind the scenes as S.O.B. (Standard Operating Bullshit). It is but one fictional story that represents many, many similar true-life cases of successful failure.

An absolute must-see.  It's dreamy and romantic, yet cynical, so it's like having your cake and eating it, too. The Brothers Bridges are excellent (I wonder how much of their real-life relationship crept into their on-screen relationship) and Michelle Pfeiffer is absolutely perfect as Suzie Diamond. This is the movie in which Ms. Pfeiffer transcends, completely and irrevocably, the realm of mere mortals and achieves goddess status.  She's smart, tough, funny, and sexy--all at the same time!  When she stretches out on a piano to sing Makin' Whoopee, she is radiant and reminds one of the greatness and the glamour of old Hollywood.RENT THIS MOVIE TONIGHT!!!!

How else could you explain the fact that movies like Batman Begins or Spiderman and yes even the The Lord of the Rings-trilogy make it to the top 250, but a movie like this one doesn't even get a 7/10 (The actual rating is 6.6/10 after 4,563 votes). Am I saying that this movie belongs in that list too? No, I'm not, because it is a very good movie, but there are plenty of better ones. It's just the fact that I don't understand why people no longer seem to appreciate some very good acting and a fine story anymore.The Fabulous Baker Boys tells the story about two professional musicians, Frank Baker and his younger, less committed, but more talented brother Jack, who have been playing as a piano duo in bars and hotel lounges for many years, but who seem to have lost much of their appeal to the audience. They aren't asked for new performances and they realize that something has to be done. They decide to hire a new female singer. During the auditions there isn't one who can sing or keep tone and they are convinced that they will never find one either. But then Suzie Diamond comes stepping in. She's 1.5 hours late, has a big mouth and hasn't got the right 'entertainment' experience (she has worked as an escort girl). But they give her a chance and they are astonished by her qualities. Together they make the act successful again, but when the relation between Suzie and Jack briefly becomes more than professional, tension between all three builds up and forces the band to break up...Although I didn't know the name of the director, Steven Kloves, I was convinced that this could be a very good movie. The reason for that was because I knew that Sydney Pollack was one of the producers. That's no guarantee for success of course, but it sure helped me to get some confidence in this movie. And it has to be said. Kloves has done a fine job in writing and directing this movie. I'm sure that it will not appeal to a large audience because it isn't very spectacular, but what he has done with it certainly proves that the man has talent. He has written a solid, effective, but simple story without too many extra's and I really appreciate that. Also in his direction he has kept everything quite sober. This is 'just' a love story involving a small band, but it works and that's all that matters. Of course he has been helped by his excellent cast. Jeff Bridges and Beau Bridges are really very good in playing the two pianists, but it was Michelle Pfeiffer who had me completely in her power. Not only does she look and act very sensual in this movie, she sings like an angel. I knew that she was a very talented actor, but that she could sing that well, really was a big surprise to me.Overall this movie deserves to be seen by a bigger audience, although I'm convinced that it will never happen. It lacks everything to draw in a big crowd and even when they give it a try, they will probably not like it because it's nothing special in their opinions. Personally I liked it a lot. A good story, some very fine acting, very good directing,... make me believe that this movie doesn't deserve a rating lower than a 7.5/10.

There aren't many films of the eighties that match the sheer class of the best studio pictures of the thirties, forties and fifties.  This one does.  Watch the scene where Jeff Bridges lights Pfeiffer's cigarette for a few seconds' vignette of perfectly restrained and utterly revealing acting.  But then, almost every scene in this movie is at or near this standard. It's a film in a thousand, if that, that makes you believe you are seeing a glimpse into real life at a particular place and time.  The Fabulous Baker Boys is three people's intersecting lives in Seattle in the late eighties.  As real as if you had been there?  No.  As right as if you had been there?  Yes.

She is the star of the show and gives one hell of a performance too. The story isn't unique. There are probably more movies made like this, trying to tell the same thing, but for me it really worked. I love every scene of this movie. I love piano's, beautiful women, Jeff Bridges' acting and great performances in general. The Fabulous Baker Boys has it all.It think it truly deserves a better rating. 6.6 is way too low. I should at least reach the level of 7/10. I personally would give this movie an 8 or 8,5, but to compensate the underrating a little I will give it a 9. I can't think of any reason not the see this movie. It isn't a psychological drama. It's a drama with a fine story, great performances and a wonderful cast. Michelle Pfeiffer deserved the awards she won for her performance. To me, it became kind of a classic. See this movie!

Everything in this story falls into place, the pace is great, the acting is brilliant and yet it's in the details that one discovers the masterpiece. There's the audition scene, the little story about the sick dog and the girl from next door to show you Jeff Bridges does care, the introductions by Beau as they perform in their special place, The Starfire Lounge and then repeats the same line in another cocktail bar, the bathroom scenes in the hotel they do their Festive season gig (quite different what you might have expected from a bathroom scene between Michelle Pfeiffer and Jeff Bridges !), the dog leaving the elevator in the hotel on his own to join his boss who is playing alone, his kind of music. This movie gets better with repeated viewings, so buy it instead of renting it.It's a mystery to me why Steve Kloves did not make more films and instead waited to become a scriptwriter for the Harry Potter films more than 10 years later.

Yet, without a doubt the fact remains that this movie, on many levels is extraordinary.(not OK or good-extraordinary.) I Personally am very surprised there aren't a lot more comments on here about Baker Boys.Obviously, Michelle as well as the Bridges brothers were fantastic. But most have said that so I won't get into that to much. I was very impressed(and a bit awed) by this screenplay and how incredible, not just the dialogue was, but the mannerisms, the little back and Fourths and quirks of each person-the writing was way above merely being good. Beyond admiration, however, I was touched by the writer's ability to capture the world of entertainment and music so perfectly. This is a movie where, (after Suzy, frank and Jack), the music and world these people live in, becomes the fourth main character of the movie. And anyone who has lived in a similar reality at anytime in their life, will feel like their seeing old friends....My viewing experience was not perhaps the most fun I've ever had, for two simple reasons. One, because I, like many others, will concede this movie moves extremely slowly and unfortunately slow movingness in a movie is one thing that's always been a problem for me. Second, this movie is draped in nostalgia and made me feel more sad then anything else when it was over. The gloom I felt however, was also coupled with knowing I just watched a really well done movie-so it was gloom mixed with admiration, sort of like listening to Pink Floyd.It takes time to get into Baker Boys, it's a slow burn not an immediate rush. It is one of the most nostalgic pictures I've ever Seen. People have mentioned 70's, 80's I'd say those periods and even earlier. There's an old style glamor coupled with a bittersweet sleepy nostalgia-and anyone who has experienced the stuff of nighttime, and neon lights, will be back in that place again whether they want to be there or not. That's entertainment.

She's a former escort and blues singer, whom they hire to rejuvenate their somewhat tired act.     This she does, in more ways than one. The Fabulous Baker Boys is an accurate and frank depiction of musicians' lives-on-the-road.  It reveals what happens after the audience goes home and the musicians retire to their nice hotel rooms.But after years, one nice hotel room is the same as another.  Likewise, their music routines can become as stale as leftover tobacco smoke in their vacated clubs. Jeff and Beau Bridges execute some the finest work of their careers in this film.  Likewise, Michelle Pfeiffer equally supports them, as well as does her own singing. Dave Grusin and John Hammond's soundtrack piano renditions are excellent, as is Peggy Holmes' choreography for Ms. Pfeiffer.  Sydney Pollack was wise to financially support this production as executive producer.Writer director Steven Kloves came up with a winner here, marred only by some general slow pacing and an ambiguous though appropriate ending.The Fabulous Baker Boys' reputation continues to grow and be appreciated by more audiences, through cable and DVD distributions.   It signifies a rare glimpse at backstage life-on-the-road of musicians who so enrich our lives, yet are all too often taken for granted.

The Baker Boys have been playing dual pianos on the lounge circuit for years, with Frank (Beau) acting as the booking manager and accountant. When the bookings dry up, the brothers decide to hire a singer. She's Susie Diamond, a gorgeous blond with a sultry voice and sexy appearance that gives the Baker Boys the pizazz that they need to pick up better gigs and more of them. Of course, one can't wait for the handsome, quietly intense Jack (Jeff) and Susie to give into their sexual chemistry, despite Frank's warnings that Jack's hit and run technique will not work with a teammate. When Frank is called away on a family emergency, more than sex happens. Ultimately Susie's bluntness and ability to see a situation for what it is makes Jack realize he hates the act, hates the way his brother handles it, and hates himself for not pursuing work as a jazz musician.Someone wrote that the plot is thin - not really. The sibling dynamics are real, pent up, and the product of years of lip-biting, Jack becoming more and more introverted and Frank more desperate to work so he can support his family. It takes an outsider to bring tempers to a boil.The film is very well done, with great music throughout, including some very hot singing by Pfeiffer. The highlight of the movie is Pfeiffer rolling around on the piano as she sings to Jack. She's really at the height of her beauty and can compare favorably to any Hollywood goddess of the past. Her performance as a street-wise singer who's had it tough is excellent, right down to the chewing gum and the crystal jewelry. Beau Bridges is perfectly cast. He plays a working musician for whom music is a job - and yet he's proud of the act, insistent on having Feelings in every show they do, and likes songs like Bali Hai. Then we come to Jeff Bridges, certainly one of the sexiest men to ever come down the pike - tall and handsome, he is the essence of true jazz musician here - passionate on the piano, cool, loving the night life and the attendant bad habits of drinking and smoking. He's all tied up in his inability to break free of his brother, and it's expressed in every non-expression, every puff of his cigarette. He's fantastic.Another reviewer on this site stated that non-musicians probably can't understand Jack's frustration about the music. It's true, I'm a trained musician and related to his crisis immediately. But I think many people are in jobs they don't like, many people have a book they never finished because the kids came along - I think this is a very appealing story.I remember this film getting a big build-up when it was released, but many people on IMDb feel it's underrated. I didn't realize it was, but if it is, it shouldn't be. What a movie - a strange kind of a love story for sure, between a man and his music, but a love story nevertheless.

The Baker brothers have been playing together for thirty-one years, and professionally for fifteen years. We learn early on, by Jacks' tone, that he is not a 'happy camper'. His remarks are short, flip, and sarcastic. Frank is the big brother, protector, organizer, and their work manager.  Frank tends to play the games of life while little brother, Jack fights them.Professionally, they are not doing so well, so Frank comes up with the idea to take on a singer. From the minute, Susie Diamond (Michelle Pfeiffer) strolls into the audition late, we see that she has an edge to her just like Jack. She is wise-cracking, gum-chewing, and sarcastic, but wonderful singer  that turns this duo into a trio. From the first song she sings with them, there is a real transformation--first of the group, and later in the film as individuals. After the first night on the road together, Frank says Mark my words, from this night forward our lives will never be the same. And he is right.Jack turns out to be not as tough as he appears.This is shown by his relationship with his neighbor's young daughter, whom he teaches piano lessons to, and his love for his dog, Eddy. But everything changes on a New Year's Eve road gig. By now, Frank senses there is something between Jack and Susie, and makes it known to his little brother that he doesn't like it. Frank gets called away and while he is gone, the sparks fly between Jack and Susie. The next two scenes are really intense. The first between Jack and Susie. Their dialog cuts like a knife. They each have each other's number and manage to say things that cut to the core of one another. At one point, Susie says, You know I has you pegged as a loser the first time I saw you. But, I was wrong, you're worse, you're a coward. Ouch! Cut to Frank and Jack playing in a telethon. Jack, not being happy about the gig, says, You let that guy turn us into clowns tonight. Where is your dignity? Frank answers, ...I have to be responsible. And that speaks volumes about the relationship between the two of them.I don't want to give any more of the movie away. It is very well acted by Beau and Jeff Bridges, and by Michelle Pfieffer. They do a great job. And let's just say, it is very realistic especially when Frank keeps referring to Jack as little brother. You just imagine that is how Beau talks to his little brother, Jeff.

In The Fabulous Baker Boys she does it all with her face, voice, and body in one of the most remembered renditions of Making Whoopie, a hallmark performance on the par with Rita Hayworth's rendition of Put the Blame on Mame. A charming story of brotherly love, it features bachelor kuul dude, Jack (Jeff Bridges) and nerdy family guy, Frank (Beau Bridges),as a middle aged piano duo who have been a performing act since children. They play the circuit of small rooms in chain motels and hotels, cocktail lounges, and bars over 300 nights a year and have made a successful, if unnoticed living. However, with cuts to their expected schedule, the brothers realize they must make a change and take on a sexy vocalist, Suzy Diamond (Michelle Pfeiffer). Suzy is a size 6, chain-smoking, foul-mouth, show-stopper beauty who cleans up well, and complicates the brother's ordered lives by asking for equal billing, and her photo on the marquee card. Adding to the dilemma, Suzy knows she does not like singing Feelings night after night, or Bali Hi. Jack wants Suzy for his own duet, but not the complications of a true commitment. Frank just wants Suzy to not swear into the microphone. The strain of a new member in to the daily grind on the road takes its toll on the brother's relationship, as Suzy's presence finally awakens Jack from his complacent attitude towards his life, and Frank, to stand up for himself and their professional career.The real life brothers, Beau, the cute one, and Jeff, the hunk, are never more true to themselves portraying brothers, who long ago put their desires and needs on the back burner. These performances are subtle, mature, and nuanced and a joy to watch. Michelle Pfeiffer's presence is worth the price of admission if only to watch her writhe on the Steinway, and her vocals are her own. One of the better performances by an actress recognized for her beauty, she proves her chops and vocal talent with Suzy's quixotic mixture of tough-girl and model chic. As a trio, the cast mesh and support each other as a musical drama with hi and low notes given the attention worthy of a concert performance.

There's two partners (in this case, the Baker Boys) who have had a lounge act for over fifteen years and suddenly have their lives thrown upside down when a gorgeous lounge singer enters the act. Jack (the unsettled playboy brother played by Jeff Bridges) falls for the showstopping Suzie (Michelle Pfeiffer), much to the dismay of responsible family man Frank (Beau Bridges). The whole setup is so corny and predictable that it's hard to believe writer/director Steve Kloves fashioned something so wonderful out of it. The Fabulous Baker Boys overflows with style and class. The cinematography by Michael Ballhaus is lush and atmospheric. Kloves' direction is smart and so his script, which artlessly combines humor, romance, and drama in a surprisingly poignant story about hopes and dreams. Dave Grusin's jazzy score and the gorgeous melodies only enhance the mood. Best of all, though, are the performances. Casting the Bridges brothers as the Baker boys was inspired. It's fascinating to determine how much of their real-life relationship is played out here. Beau brings numerous grace notes to what could have been a stereotypical character and Jeff gives one of his best performances as the miserable Jack. But, the big news in this movie is Pfeiffer, who became a star with this sharp, confident, stunningly sexy turn. The screen literally jolts to life when she appears. And that now-classic scene where she sings Makin' Whoopee on a piano is certain to immortalize her as one of the great movie stars of this century (and one of the best of current actresses as well). Pfeiffer's in a class all by herself, and so is this movie.

Neither piggybacked on the other's success and while their father's name might have opened a door or two, Beau and Jeff never piggybacked on him either.When they did a joint project each had a well respected career. The Fabulous Baker Boys is about a pair of musician brothers who have a double piano act, something like Ohman&Arden from the Thirties or Jose and Ampara Iturbi, brother and sister in a more classical vein. But they're not anything as successful as the examples I mentioned. They eke out an existence in the clubs in Seattle trying to scratch a living at what they love.Beau takes a lot of guff to keep them employed as he's married with children and Jeff puts up with nothing. To liven up the act they decide a sexy girl singer is what they need and after some dismal candidates they find Michelle Pheiffer. But Michelle dishes out her own brand of guff and she causes The Fabulous Baker Boys to reexamine themselves and their lives.Pheiffer got a Best Actress nomination one of four categories of Oscar nominations the film received. She dominates the film when she's on and not through sheer beauty. It was a well deserved performance, I love the scenes when she cuts Jeff Bridges down to size. She isn't easy on Beau either.Lots of the kind of music I like, vocal and instrumental, is found in The Fabulous Baker Boys. That's a guarantee right there I would enjoy the film.It's only too bad that Beau and Jeff could not work their father into this one.

Jeff Bridges may be the most under-appreciated actor today - this performance shows that, as well as past roles, ranging from the wholly-sympathetic Starman, to the consummately evil defendant in Jagged Edge. He and his brother, Beau, present a believable duo as the pedestrian pianists who finally achieve a modicum of higher-level success. And if there is a more appealing actress, anywhere, than Michelle Pfeiffer, I'm not aware of it. Of equal importance is how the story presents precisely the proper balance of harmony and conflict, and depicts three strong, yet diverse, characters. The music, which here is a companion to the story, is far superior to that found in most of the movies where the music is the ONLY reason for their making.

Just because two actors are actual brothers doesn't mean they can convey the particular fictional brothers of the film. And this film was about the two men, with a mutual affection and dependency that they never had to articulate, until the need for a girl singer became evident.And what a singer they got in Michelle Pheiffer's Susie Diamond. The hard boiled prostitute with a heart of gold is a well worn cliché in films, that takes some genuine writing and acting talent to transcend. Pheiffer did this with a seeming effortlessness that defined Susie as a unique individual.Unlike most successful films this one's achievement lies in its very moderation, its telling only enough of each character's life to make them real. So we never meet Beau's family, even though Jeff has a key scene in his basement. It would have only been diverting at this stage of the film.The relationship between Susie and Jeff Bridges, Jack Baker was also just as much as we needed to know. The mixed feelings of their first sexual liaison as a trade off of a good business relationship for a long shot love affair was perfectly demonstrated in both of them in their own rooms expressing with the same tone, shit! I saw this film on TV after seeing it first at a theater some two decades ago. Perhaps, I'm older, or I've seen too many less skillfully crafted films in the interim, but I appreciated it even more this time.This is both a quality film, and damn enjoyable evening's entertainment.

I've always considered him to be one of Hollywood's most underrated 'stars' and consider his performance in The Fabulous Baker Boys to be the crowning point of his acting career. Admittedly, the story is just a vignette - or slice of life - and not a vast tapestry 'à la Gone with the Wind', but then it makes no pretensions to be more than a short story rather than a giant tome. Furthermore there are some wonderful jazz numbers and a couple of original Grusin melodies - Jack's theme - that are as good as any I have heard before, and I'm an amateur jazz musician.I came across it again a couple of years later when window-shopping on a sunny Sunday. I heard some wonderful music wafting out of a shop and went in to ask what it was; 'It's Dave Grusin The fabulous Baker Boys' said the owner and it suddenly came back to me. I bought the record the following day hoping to get an extended version of Jack's Theme, and was very disappointed to discover that it was nowhere on the compilation of melodies and numbers taken from the film.Over the years I have consulted many music pages- from the dedicated FBB website where I downloaded the Jack's Theme music-snippet from the film - to more esoteric, pure-contemporary jazz sites. Then I bought the DVD - and played the different versions of Jack's Theme in a loop much to my family's irritation - but have never found anyone who has recorded a long, improvised version of this theme. Is there anyone out there who knows if it has been recorded by someone other then Grusin for the film? This is a film you can see again and again, either from beginning to end, or, as I do, just watching my favourite scenes of 'Jack' playing the piano - first, alone, in the hotel, then, with a trio in the Jazz Cellar. It's like eating a piece of chocolate a moment of anticipation followed by a rush of happiness.But when will we get the the Fabulous Baker Boys 2 in which we see the rise and rise of Jack in a Jazz environment?

A later-shift worker, Bruce had caught a morning showing of the film, and that afternoon tried to get across to us, through red-faced giggles, just how hot Michelle Pfeiffer had been while singing Makin' Whoopee. Well, it's taken me a full 22 years to catch up with this picture, but now that I have, I can finally see what all the, uh, whoopty-do was about. And yet, strangely, that by-now classic scene, with la Pfeiffer warbling and writhing atop the piano, strikes this viewer--who thinks that ANYTHING Michelle Pfeiffer does is ultrasexy--as merely more of the same. Even her frumpy Selena Kyle in Batman Returns and dressed-down, depressed waitress in Frankie and Johnny were, to these eyes, stunning; is it just me, or is Michelle Pfeiffer kinda good looking? To quote an old Little Richard song, more closely associated with the actress Jayne Mansfield, the girl can't help it.Anyway, in the film in question, we meet a pair of brothers, Frank and Jack Baker (played, respectively, by Beau and Jeff Bridges), who have been doing their double-piano act professionally together for over 15 years. Though obviously hugely talented, their schmaltzy act has remained static for all that time...not that the hotel lounge and tiki bar audiences they routinely play in front of seem to notice. Older brother Frank, a happily married family man, seems content to let things go as they have been, but Jack, a chain-smoking, morose womanizer, is obviously quite unhappy; we later see that his dream is to be a jazz pianist playing more improvisatory fare. Hoping to shake up their act a bit, the team decides to hire a female singer, and after auditioning 37 dismal prospects--possibly the film's single funniest scene; cutie pie Jennifer Tilly's rendition of Candy Man is a hoot--finally selects a beautiful young woman whose only previous entertaining experience had been in an escort agency. She is Susie Diamond, a woman as tough, bright, priceless, multifaceted and hardheaded as her name suggests, played, of course, by our Michelle. Susie's advent, naturally, causes major changes in both the brothers' relationship and in the act itself....The Fabulous Baker Boys is very much a three-person story, but the film's stars have such excellent chemistry together that the viewer never minds at all. The film has a wonderfully mournful, jazzy soundtrack, courtesy of Dave Grusin, and writer/director Steve Kloves has done a fine job in both departments. His picture looks sleek and shiny, and though set in the city of Seattle, never, strangely enough, gives us a single shot of that darn Space Needle, to its credit. The film contains many memorable scenes; I love the steamy one in which Jack gives Susie a New Year's Eve back massage, the one in which Jack and Susie have it out in the street after she quits the team, and the one in which the Bakers effortlessly pound out You're Sixteen in Frank's garage. The acting from all three principals is of course first rate, although the picture is an especial success for Pfeiffer, who not only looks stunning and gives a deservedly Oscar-nominated performance (ultimately losing to Jessica Tandy's career-capper Oscar for Driving Miss Daisy), but also gets to demonstrate what a nice way she has with a torch song, as well. During the course of the film, the viewer is treated to the awesome spectacle of this phenomenally beautiful woman warbling such standards as More Than You Know, Ten Cents a Dance, Can't Take My Eyes Off You, The Look of Love, My Funny Valentine, Feelings and, of course, Makin' Whoopee, and she really is better than good. In a picture where all the elements come together deliciously, Michelle's supersexy singing is the yummy icing on the cake. Indeed, I find myself getting a bit red faced and giggly, a la my old work buddy Bruce, just thinking about it....

After 15 years,the act is getting stale and the brothers hire a singer (Miss M.Pfeiffer) to give it some much needed pizazz. Cue a renewed surge of creative energy from Jack and Miss Pfeiffer's outspoken opinions causing friction between the brothers. The Fabulous Baker Boys is perhaps a little too incessantly downbeat to succeed in the mainstream but is an accurate picture of life at the less glamorous end of the music business. The brothers' rather mundane act is immediately transformed by the addition of Miss Pfeiffer who is going places,but will they be able to keep up? There are outstanding performances by all three headliners,some wonderful music that made me want to get out my old George Shearing albums.

In the music profession, they are closer to the equivalent of bottom feeders, plying their trade as two-piano lounge musicians. Moreover, gigs in Seattle, where they are based, are getting harder and harder to extract from nightclub owners. Lack of pizazz is beginning to show. The brothers thus reach a business decision to audition for a female singer to enliven their act, leading to Michelle Pfeiffer, whose character is named Susie Diamond and looks every bit the name.As even those who have not seen the movie may be aware, the highlight is Pfeiffer's show-stopping performance of Makin' Whoopee in a sleek red dress atop Jeff Bridges' piano. It occurs, as the trio ascends to better venues, in the ballroom of a getaway resort hotel on New Year's Eve. Pfeiffer won a Golden Globe and other awards for best actress, but Jessica Tandy won the corresponding Oscar for Driving Miss Daisy.My vote still goes to Pfeiffer, and to Susie. The intriguing, charisma-challenged character, however, is the punctilious Frank, a devoted family man and manager of the act. Frank's pitches to his audiences, making segues from one song to another, are schmaltzy to the point of embarrassment, and yet he applies a time-honored work ethic to his calling, and construes the approach as professionalism. To his brother Jack, in contrast, it's just a job, the relative status of which may be what is life-grating and produces his usual sullenness. Jack would rather be doing a sneak-away stint at a jazz club than pursuing the everyday career into which he is slotted.So... Pfeiffer is great. Beau Bridges, in her shadow, is more overlooked than he should be. As is the movie. Jeff Bridges rounds out the cast and has his moments. It's a good rental option for a New Year's Eve.

Beau, Jeff and Michelle ever so poignantly take you through those hoops in an utterly realistic, no-holds barred fashion. How many groups have you seen like this the average-joe player who gets the gigs basically due to his business acumen; the prodigy who seems to disdain all beneath him, which to him is just about everybody; the chanteuse who pretty much wants to have it my way or the highway; the endless and sundry flock of wannabee auditioners who need just one chance to prove themselves? Sound familiar? Then you need to watch and absorb this one-of-a kind movie.Beau and Jeff are so realistic in their roles that you have to wonder if the two of them, brothers in real life, actually did musical gigs together when they were younger. It seems as if sibling warfare in real life spills over in this drama. The mounting tension among the three principals is deftly crafted by the director/writer, Steve Cloves, who carefully and slowly weaves his story line to include not only musical issues but also how all this tension affects other facets of their lives. The supporting characters, whom many other reviewers have noted, are superb in their more minimal yet effective roles, especially Jennifer Tilly. No wasted motion in this simultaneously tough and tender movie with ample doses of humor and pathos. But all the above would go for much less were it not for Dave Grusin's gorgeous sound track and keyboard renderings especially as they pertain to the ever so hauntingly soulful recurring theme.

I always wondered why Beau Bridges was so called, especially when contrasted here against his real-life (as well as in the story) brother. Beau is plain, balding (running joke about using a revolutionary new hair tonic, in a spray can) and married, while a smooth and fresh-skinned - with Fabulous hair! - Jeoff, we see waking up with his latest sexual encounter at the film's start and is dashing throughout.There's a wonderful predictability in the story that whilst obvious is essential as the piano-playing brothers, who've had the same act for the last 15 years, get the sack from their cosy cocktail lounge slot. Get a girl singer, to add glamour and class is what they decide and so the essential misfits and talentless line up to audition. Of course, Pfeiffer stumbles in late, swears, but, as only in the movies sways them and gets the job.This is, of course the most sublime part of the movie; Pfeiffer, in tight shapely dress, draped over a shiny grand piano, Jeoff and Beau tinkling the ivories and the excellent Dave Grusin score ever achingly evocative and playful. But, of course, the frictions start to seep in and of course, the magic can't last.As I said, the tried & trusted music/fame/film formula works well but is never obvious and we are left with an ending as open as the beginning, which is refreshing - and for the better. Any lesser film would have a sugary pigeon-holed finale that would raise the happy level but which would dissipate immediately after.Though there is some swearing, this film doesn't need, or resort to adult material and in this day and age, this is like a breath of fresh air. Actually, the whole experience could be summed up as such, yes, a breath of beautiful, fresh air.

Writer and director Steve Kowes takes his time in telling the story but this allows the viewer to explore the layers. It gives a detailed 'profile' of the characters. The film very much is a character study as well as a story of two musician brothers. The dialogues are well written, full of wit, humour and depth. The atmosphere of music and struggling in showbiz is well created. It brings a nostalgic gloomy feel of the 70s and 80s but it ends on a positive note. The mise en scene is marvelous. The soundtrack is a classic. I loved the piano pieces and of course the famous 'Makin Whoopy' (which is beautifully shot) sung by a sensual Michelle Pfeiffer.The Bridges brothers and Ms. Pfeiffer are fantastic. The fragile relationship between the Baker brothers and the nuances and quirks are well depicted. Jeff portrays the angry quiet one who doesn't take crap from anyone and who is deeply passionate about the music while Beau is the more 'responsible' one, cleaning up the messes, booking the shows and having other priorities before music. Enters a fiery and brutally honest (but with a sense of humour) Pfeiffer who changes their lives.The story is fictional but the title gives the impression of being a biopic which it's not. On the surface 'The Fabulous Baker Boys' may look like a story about romance and a fragile relationship between two brothers but the underlying central theme is a lot darker. There was a time when the brothers shared their passion for music but along the way and throughout the years priorities changed and a resentment grew between them.

He's a fish out of water where the other two are concerned, and the butt of their jokes. He can't see that the Baker Boys have a stale act which needs to move with the times, and can't understand the different dynamics which drive his brother.Jeff Bridges plays Jack, dissolute, arrogant, promiscuous, who juggles life with the Baker Boys with his real love, playing in the local sleazy jazz club. He befriends the little girl from upstairs who seems to be a mother figure to him, and develops an intense fixation on Pfeiffer.Pfeiffer's Susie is a man-magnet, draped over the piano singing 'Making Whoopee'. She is a sexy breath of fresh air in the brothers' act, one who isn't afraid to make comments like 'Feelings is parsley', and, after Frank's outburst against her use of the F-word during a performance, 'I said it, I didn't do it'.My favourite line in the film though is from Jack to Frank after discovering that big brother sprays dye on to his bald spot to hide it in performance 'It's paint, Frank'.

Jack has grown cynical and bored of the whole affair and his relationships are mostly impersonal one-night stands; meanwhile Frank is much more stable, with a home and family life in the suburbs. As work starts to stagnate thanks to a series of boring, flat shows the brothers decide that they need to do something to spice things up and decide to bring a singer into the act. They bring in the beautiful but hard Susie Diamond. The new element and sexual tension in their new act helps raise their status and bring in the bookings but soon the tensions build off stage, especially as she provides to have more an impact in the act's dynamics than they had foreseen.Probably best known for that dress in that scene, it does say something that, despite having seen it a few times, that scene sticks in my memory a lot more than the story, the relationships or the characters. Part of the reason for this is that none of them are really that well done. The story is all about the relationships but these are not that well drawn and actually consist of quite simple characters who aren't really developed much beyond a few steps, making it difficult to be drawn in too much. That said it does do enough to keep the audience watching because the blocks are there and they are interesting enough. The relationships are obvious early on and don't grow so much as they just change in the manner we expect them to. The musical numbers help add energy every now and again, helping the film break up the falls out and conflict to good effect.I don't mean to sound so down on the film because, even if it was slow and downbeat, I did still like it as it did enough to keep me interested if hardly enthralled. Part of the reason I was interested was the solid if unspectacular acting from the lead three. Jeff Bridges is the main character and he is the complex one on the surface; he doesn't do anything special but he does enough to keep this basic frame interesting. Beau is obvious for the majority but is more interesting towards the end but the film is less interested in him. Pheiffer belts out a good tune but also plays a feisty character that is enjoyable and makes the dynamics of the act much more engaging.Overall this is not an amazing film but it does enough with what it has to be engaging enough as a story and with characters that are not brilliant but are developed enough to do the job. The actors are solid and engaging and do really help the material, making it into a film that is steady, downbeat character tale that is good enough to make it worth seeing if you are in the mood for something that some will see as a little dull.

He is making films we actually want to see. Few film makers could pull off such a confident debut with such style and panache. The script is an absolute gem and is in fact, too good. Characters tend to articulate their feelings and come out with the perfect one liner in a way which defies credibility. During heated arguments you only curse yourself for what you should have said afterwards. No matter, the dialogue crackles. I'm surprised there's nothing in the quote section yet. Everybody always goes, whoah! and sharply intakes breath when Pfeiffer says to Bridges at least my brother isn't my pimp. In fact, I go whoah! when I watch it on my own. The fight between the brothers is blistering and funny. The scene on the balcony is beautifully lit and directed, invoking nostalgia for old Hollywood glamour, and whose plots it almost parodies, without getting into kitch. It can't quite recapture that life and magic though, which it seems almost to acknowledge in it's bittersweet plot. The bit where they spontaneously play one last burst of 'Sixteen' together without the stress of a gig or future together is one of the most touching moments in the picture.Bridges is superlative in this role, impossibly glamorous in his black suit and white shirts. Bringing a smile to a young girls lips on the roof after losing his temper makes him irresistable. The scene where he and Pfeiffer avoid each other at the hotel is a class act. Beau is also excellent. When he leaves the picture it sags a little. Where it nearly falls apart is that Pfeiffer can't sing and it is so glaring in the audition sequence that we are left baffled by the fact they seem impressed. Her rendition of 'feelings' is also flat and makes you cringe. Thankfully the film is too good to be let down by this. A very 'seventies' movie, and although there are longuers towards the end, overall an excellent piece of work.

The acting is nothing short of breathtaking with the three leads exuding tension by the bucket-load. Jeff Bridges says little but boy do you feel his pain, hurt, shame and anger every time the camera settles on his face. Beau also brings a career best performance as the put upon brother who doesn't quite have the talent of his womanising sibling. Enter Ms Pfeiffer as Suzie Diamond, a singer they hire to boost their booking potential, and - slowly but surely - all hell is let loose. When Ms Pfeiffer sings 'Makin Whoopee' I found my heart got lodged in my throat. If there is a sexier performance on screen - fully clothed - please tell me what it is.Considering nobody's life is at stake, no mad axe man is on the loose and it's a musical tale of troubled romance and unfulfilled ambition, it's about the most excitement you can have on your sofa with your clothes on.If you've never seen this and you like pleasant surprises, I recommend you give it a viewing.

Panorama. image1.jpeg The Fabulous Baker Boys 1989, by first time director Steve Kloves who later made the Harry Potter films. Seen as part of a retrospective of the films of famed Berlin born DOP, Michael Ballhaus, Now 82, who gets a Silver Bear this year for his life's work as a dependable Hollywood cinematographer who worked with many top directors. This however isn't one of the.Film features the real life brothers Beau and Jeff Bridges as two fictional Brothers, Frank and Jack Baker, who are not particularly fabulous but play dual back-to-back jazzy piano gigs at cheap night spots in Seattle. Whe the jobs get slim they decide that they need a female singer to liven up their fading act. After many hopeless auditions guess who turns up -- an incredibly scruffed down Michelle Pfeiffer who happens to have a knockout voice like a white Billie Holiday and a very come hither stage presentation. Her dynamic style injects new life into the Baker Boys act with a highlight reached when she drapes herself all over Jeff's grand piano as if copulating with the instrument during a sensational singing number -- Making Whoopee -- the memorable high point of a fundamentally forgettable picture.Unfortunately, for the rest of the film, although she has become pianist Jeff Bridges' lover and there are extended groping and snuggling scenes between them -- there is, oddly enough, no screen Chemistry between them -- zilch -- and the film dies a slow death from there. Whether it was the direction or some kind of real disattraction is hard to say, but despite the fact that both Jeff and Michele are at the height of their early screen attractiveness what one sees on screen is sheer mechanical sham. One device overly used in the Film is Jeff constantly with a lit cigarette in his mouth as if he were supposed to be Bogart in Casablanca or Gainsbourg in Paris. It just doesn't fit his look or personality and everything else in the picture including Pfeiffer's overdone raggedness is out of kilter. Even the Ballhaus cinematography is nothing to write home about. The brothers end up hassling each other heavily for no good dramatic reason and in the end Bridges rejects Pfeiffer, or was it the other way around? Anyway, she walks off into driftlessness as the picture finally ends. I normally like Bridges movies but this was a surprising disappointment from every angle considering the promising cast. One down and many more to go in a packed festival week.

Without the older Baker Boy carrying his loser but more talented younger brother and helping him make a living, Jeff Bridges' character would probably have ended it all many years earlier, as he was about as depressive and soul-empty as one can get and still be alive. Not even M. Pfieffer's hot chick character could turn this guy around. Well, maybe, but we'll never know for sure, but I doubt it. At the end, I was not at all convinced that the younger Baker could make it through life on his own, much less be a success as a pianist and a man.I will not tell the story, others have done that, but will say that Beau has been mostly overlooked as an actor primarily because he didn't get the edgy good looks Jeff got, and he seems to have trouble keeping his weight down. All things being equal, he is nearly the equal of Jeff as an actor, albeit in different very types of roles.Beau's character, a smarmy and controlling little man with no musical ambitions above just making a truly embarrassing living playing duet piano in crummy third rate clubs for tiny and unappreciative audiences, was what made this film so interesting as he got the wimpy overachiever role here that Jack Lemmon got when in his prime, and Beau made the tough story touchingly human and familial. Jeff's no-account character had all he could do just to show up and plink some notes, but he was as good in the role as ever.Yes, Jack Lemmon might have been better(too old), but Beau did an excellent job with it and was the real star of this film. Pfieffer was her usual icy self, her body and face very hot for a boink but her dicey character not so hot for a good relationship. But who knows... put her and Jeff together with their mutual deficiencies and it could make for a harsh but lasting relationship, albeit one that probably would feed itself on its mutual misery.

I don't think I heard a single song sung or played from beginning to end, just snatches or noodling on the keys. There is no score, only source music and it runs to traditional older pop tunes.The Fabulous Baker Boys is an act consisting of two brothers, Beau and Jeff Bridges, who play dual pianos in various not-too-high-end Seattle night clubs. They've been playing together, the same songs in the same lounges, for fifteen years and they're getting pretty fagged out with the routine.So they audition a couple of dozen singers and wind up with the tarty Michelle Pfeiffer. Well, if you must have a vocalist who used to be a whore, it might as well look like Pfeiffer. Her singing voice is close to indifferent but what does it matter? However -- cherchez la femme. Beau may be married and tied down, but the younger and rather morose Jeff is not. Jeff lives on a diet of cocktail waitresses and pretty soon, against Beau's admonitions, Jeff and Michelle are a couple, at least for two nights, but their future together hangs in the air like an unspoken question. Pfieffer isn't the cause of the argument, just a catalyst. The wind up is that The Fabulous Baker Boys separate and go their independent ways -- Beau to giving piano lessons to the neighborhood kids, Jeff to irregular gigs in small clubs where he is allowed to play the kind of music he likes.What kind of music does he like? It's bluesier and jazzier than the easy listening he's used to playing, but it reaches for Beegie Adair, not Oscar Peterson. Pfeiffer catches a glimpse of him alone playing his own style and Bridges' looks transported, though he's not bent over the piano in a Steven Hawkings posture like Bill Evans.I don't think there are too many surprises in store for an experienced viewer. Jeff is moody and unresponsive from the outset, so we know he's due for a committed relationship soon. When Pfeiffer shows up, we know what shape that commitment is liable to take. Beau is the most amusing of the three principals, a worrier who tears his hair out over small details, and there are some amusing gags built into the script and the dialog.In fact, it's nicely written. The story doesn't take us into unexplored territory but it's easy on the eyes and ears and overall rather diverting. I know this is going to derail the essay but, speaking of unexplored territory, the title for this review came from an experience I had many moons ago in San Diego, reading a book by Andrew Dickson White (first president of the college I was to attend two years later) called On The Warfare of Science and Theology in Christendom, while listening to Anita O'Day sing a pop tune on the radio. And as my eyes skimmed White's words on the page -- the music of the spheres -- the same words were repeated in synchrony by the lyrics in the song, as if Anita O'Day were reading the text aloud. THAT is what I'd call unexplored territory. Look out, now.

He never hits a false note as the musician who can't commit himself to anything, including women, his nightclub career and his brother, BEAU BRIDGES, who runs the club circuit business.It's a pleasure watching these three as the story slowly evolves around their destinies as club performers, with Bridges falling out of favor with his brother over his infatuation with singer Pfeiffer who becomes an integral part of their nightclub act.The story is transparently thin and there are times when the running length of the film seems too expanded to carry the slim story. The basic premise reminds me of an old film starring Tyrone Power, Alice Faye and Don Ameche, called Alexander's Ragtime Band, in which Power and Ameche fight over their hired singer Faye. Of course, THE FABULOUS BAKER BOYS is much saltier and much grittier than that oldie, but it is just as tune-filled with some superb orchestrations of popular songs and jazz tunes, thanks to Dave Grusin's great score.Pfeiffer does her own singing and does it well, and the Bridges boys look as though they're really doing all that nimble work at the piano.

Number one is the HORRIBLE underdevelopment of the Jeff Bridges character. Jack Baker had the potential to be a sexy diamond-in-the-rough, chip on shoulder but with a big heart underneath (and let's face it, ladies, Jeff Bridges is VERY sexy in this movie), but the role always seems to be one dimensional and never really develops. There are also quite a few dull subplots (the neighbor girl, for example) and a lack of closure at the end of the film.But the film is pretty good otherwise. Jeff Bridges does do a fine job with the material he's given, and as I mentioned before, he ain't bad-looking here, either. In an inspiring casting move, his real life older brother Beau plays his older brother. Beau is funny and charming here, too (his ploy to cover up his bald spot had me in stitches). And Michelle Pfeiffer steals the film as the brash chanteuse the Baker Boys hire to liven up their stage act. And she can really sing, too!The best scene is the Bridges brothers singing You're 16 at their twin pianos. That scene alone is worth the price of a rental.

The ease and tension in the two men's connection is utterly natural and really draws you into this low-level romcom.The double act realises that, professionally, it needs a shot in the arm - the men probably understand that they need some sort of novelty to reinvigorate them as well, as the act not only pales for the diminishing customer base but also hangs heavily on them. Pfeiffer's Susie Diamond is almost too brash to be true (it's clear the writer-director Kloves had Desperately Seeking-Madonna in mind) but the combined talents of Pfeiffer and Jeff Bridges pull it off.It's odd as the film is principally remembered for a set piece in which Susie gives a sexually electric performance of Makin' Whoopee on a piano in a red dress. This is by no means the highlight of the film, although it neatly demonstrates how a little bit of circus magic, such as the Baker Boys consciously import to their act, goes a long way. That's showbiz. 5/10 "},{"Title":"Great music but fails to captivate my interest","Date":"2 August 2007","Score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Music, Romance","Review":" This film is about two jazz musicians having to hire a female singer, after their act is deemed unable to pull in crowds.The music is really striking. The piano pieces are great, and Michelle Pfeiffer sings really well. A memorable scene is that Michelle Pfeiffer swings and turns on the piano while singing in front of an audience. That must have been difficult! However, The pacing is a little slow. I don't usually have this trouble, but in this film I had a hard time understanding the dialogs. In many scenes, the dialog is far too soft to hear. Hence, I missed a lot of plot points that got discussed by the other comments. For example, I had no idea that Jack is supposed to be the more talented one. I did not get to understand who the little girl in Jack's apartment is. It could have been a good story, but somehow it fails to captivate my interest.

In what follows, there's a few moments of nicely choreographed (though predictable) comedy, but the film's real weakness is that it seems to expect us to be sympathetic to the character of Jack, whose behaviour is consistently boorish, on the (unproven) basis of his supposed innate genius. Jeff Bridges, an actor of limited range, is well cast in the part, but it's hard to care for him; the film works hard at suggesting the idea that his life is tragic, but even if so, no-one else can be blamed for this but himself. There's no way he deserves Suzy, and boy-meets-girl films just don't work if that's how the audience feels. It's fun to see two real-life brothers play on-screen siblings; and Pfiffer is appealing (though her role is somewhat clichéd); but it sums to nothing more than ordinary entertainment.

All the good acting in the world can't quite make these characters work. Michelle Pfeiffer's sugar-puss songbird is a writer's creation; wide-eyed and innocent at the emotional ruckus she causes, and yet street-smart enough to beguile us with her wise-ass nonchalance, she seldom makes logical or emotional sense. Jeff Bridges gets to moon over her like a drunken has-been in need of a haircut-and-shave, while Beau Bridges is given the kind of third-wheel role never envied by anybody. And when all is said and done, are we supposed to feel proud of the chanteuse who was compelled to do her own thing after getting her feet wet with this unremarkable duo? She spreads her wings all right, but the character is all a cliché. **1/2 from **** "},{"Title":"Pfeiffer saves this depressing experience","Date":"8 March 2008","Score":"2 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Music, Romance","Review":" I had real high expectations for the movie that earned Michelle Pfeiffer every critic award in the book plus the Golden Globe (Drama) for best actress. But this movie sinks a high low. It's a depressing romp about two brothers who have a lame piano act that consists of Grusin renditions meant for eighty year-olds with no social life. So they decide to get a female singer to spice up the act. Pfeiffer is their singer, a cynical ex-hooker who has a passable voice but sexy delivery that shows us why Pfeiffer is considered one of the most gorgeous contemporary screen actresses.Jeff Bridges has a boring role of a subdued man with major past issues, while his brother does a good job as an uptight control freak.The best part of the movie is Pfeiffer's performance of Makin' Whoopee- a segment endlessly imitated afterwards (including by Blanche on THE GOLDEN GIRLS). There's also a great seduction scene that follows it.The movie only glows when Pfeiffer is on screen, with the exception of a funny part by Jennifer Tilly. But I'm glad Jessica Tandy beat Pfeiffer for the Oscar- after watching this movie you will be too. "},{"Title":"The Not So Fabulous Baker Boys","Date":"26 January 2014","Score":"0 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Music, Romance","Review":" I really tried hard to like this film and the characters in it. The real life brothers Jeff and Beau Bridges play the titular Jack and Frank Baker, two pianists who are at the end of a once successful career, reduced to playing gigs at seedy dive bars and cheesy lounges.They decide they need new blood in the act in the form of a female singer. After auditioning what seemed to be all the tone-deaf women in Seattle (Jennifer Tilly has a cute little role as a ditsy audition hopeful who sings The Candy Man), in walks Susie Diamond (Michelle Pfeiffer), who has a shady background as an escort, but a sultry voice that catches womanizing Jack's attention. The problem with this film that was eloquently stated by another reviewer, is that we never really get to know the history of the two Baker brothers, where they came from, what the height of their career was like when they were fabulous, and the reason for their current downfall. We already see them when they're down and out, and we have no deep connection to their struggle for the rest of the story. We never really know the reason for Jack's anger and resentment toward his brother. The director should have learned this valuable lesson from Film Making 101 Show, don't tell. A few flashbacks could've explained this beautifully, but it's never there. The little neighbor girl that Jack looks after because of a neglectful mother seemed like a plot device that was thrown in. She didn't add anything valuable to the story and was another stock character for Jack to get angry at. The character of Susie was someone I really wanted to root for and feel some kind of sympathy toward, but I didn't feel much for her whatsoever. I like Michelle Pfieffer as an actress, but I was so disappointed about her character. Although she was a sultry and sexy siren on stage, her voice wasn't quite as good as I hoped it would be. It was a little rough in some places. Over the years her singing has gotten much better, most notably in Hairspray. Perhaps if there was a little more background on Susie and why she was the way she was, maybe if there was a little bit of a struggle about her wanting to be taken seriously as a singer, all that would have helped immensely in understanding her better.There were little moments that were just plain silly in the way the director tried to build sexual tension between Jack and Susie. At first Susie resists his advances, but I never understood why after the act goes on the road, Susie changes her mind all of a sudden about sleeping with Jack. The scene where they sneak into the bathroom separately to smell each others perfume and cologne was awkward. They stare and stare at each other in several scenes for what seems like ages. I love sexual tension between characters as long as it is done right and it doesn't take too long. I was anxious for them to finally get on with it. When they finally do the deed in a deserted hotel ballroom in the middle of the night after a New Year's Eve celebration, there was an attempt at an erotic moment, but it still seemed so awkward. A more realized piano sex scene occurred a year later in Pretty Woman, no doubt inspired by this film, only better. I never sensed there was enough of a reason why Jack and Susie would fall in love or care for each other. To me the romance felt obligatory.It was confusing at first to figure out what city this was set in. Seattle is a wonderful location to film in and I felt it was underused in this film, like everything else. We don't even see a shot of the Space Needle to establish that it is indeed Seattle. If it wasn't for certain posters and signs in the film that say Seattle, I never would've known what city this was set in. Cities can be characters within films as well and Seattle is a glorious city to capture the ambiance of what the Bakers' lives were like because of its rich musical history. Not so much here, and that's a shame. The biggest irony was a movie about music had such poor sound quality! I'm not sure if it was the DVD or what, but the beautiful jazz standards that were showcased should have been given the full royal aural treatment.The actors in this movie really gave their all to an underdeveloped and mediocre script. They might have thought it was a great movie, or it was just another paycheck. Who knows? Whatever their feelings about it, the director's vision from paper to the big screen just didn't translate well. I was hesitant for some reason about seeing this film for so many years. It first came into my consciousness because of the parody scene in Hot Shots!. Now I can see why this movie was worthy of ridicule.The conflict between the two brothers was absolutely believable, but I wish there was more camaraderie there, which would make the scene in which they reconcile even more powerful than it was. This movie had potential to be great, but it fell flat. I read that several big names in Hollywood turned down a chance to be in this film. Based on this halfhearted effort, it's not difficult to see why.

All three of these actors have one thing in common they all play in a lot of profane roles, as they do here. They all have garbage-mouths and love to use the Lord's name in vain. These are scummy actors but the story is good until the nastiness takes over the last half hour.Earlier, the Baker boys - Jack (Jeff Bridges) and Frank (Beau Bridges) are fun for at least half the movie. I like Pfeiffer's name in here Susie Diamond, an apt name for someone crooning Makin' Whoopee.Overall, a modern-day soap opera with too much profanity and not worth seeing just for one scene.

"},{"Title":"The Fabulous Baker Boys; or, the Art of the Cliché","Date":"16 March 2010","Score":"2 out of 16 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Music, Romance","Review":" In this tired tale, two brothers &#x96; semi-content with playing a lounge or two here or there &#x96; living in the past, consider the option of bringing a female singer into the act. One is the organizer, one is the chain-smoking wild-card that continually impresses the ladies, yet has a stronger passion for the keys. It won't take a rocket scientist to realize which is which based on mere talent alone. Throw into the mix a husky female singer, a mistaken love, and chaos between a seemingly stable piano act. As our film winds down, cliché over recycled cliché is used to tear these brothers apart, and slowly bring them back together &#x96; in an awkward way. While the film boasts collaboration between two of Hollywood's biggest brothers (one a recent Oscar winner), great piano music, and the quintessential red-dress-on-piano scene, what this film actually delivers is merely a tired script, an overused plot devise, and lines that could have been promoted by anyone with an Acting 101 degree. While the concept seems dramatic, the final result of this feature (despite the numerous awards) felt disappointing. Brotherly love destroyed by inevitable change? There were a couple of small elements to this film that worked, ensuring that The Fabulous Baker Boys was more than just a one-star movie. Bridges, muscled down by the day-to-day life of being a piano player, is watchable. His apathy towards all situations coupled with his Joe Cool smoking-attitude, creates the correct amount of tension with unknown to keep the plot slowly moving in the right direction. Beau, the weaker big-screen actor (better able to manage the television roles), tries to keep up, but what tries to be anger ends up just being a man with big eyes and anger-spit. But, on with the positives&#x85;the Bridges' music was, for lack of a better word, fabulous. Without making the guess if it was them playing, the tone of each of the songs respectively worked in their scenes. Along with the music, the visions of LA worked to show that in a city that never sleeps, these two brothers will always have work. Keep the drinks flowing, and you are sure to be a crowd pleaser.With some slight parts to make you enjoy the hour and a half of a band's destruction, the rest just crumbled quickly. To begin, while the pairing of Beau and Jeff seemed powerful on paper, the screen told otherwise. Absolutely, the two were able to play their respective roles well &#x96; Jeff the darkened, smoking, looming brother &#x96; while Beau played the optimist, looking to keep his dream (or business) alive. The issue with the Bridges' is that they are too far apart. There is never a scene to show their chemistry together as amazing pianists. Instead, we see through posters that at once they were happy, but those days are long gone. We begin our film on a downtrodden note, and it never quite picks itself up from that even when the brothers seem to be back on top again. Director Steve Kloves never gives us, the audience, an opportunity to cheer for Jeff and Beau's happiness. Instead, we are forced to suffer right along with them, picking ourselves up after each depressing hour. The same can be said for Pfeiffer, and while Oscar-nomination, Golden Globe-winning, still means something &#x96; her portrayal of Susie Diamond just wasn't breakthrough enough to be remembered after 1990. The prostitute-turned-singer routine has been done in Hollywood, over and over and over; and not to sound repetitive, better. Pfeiffer's husky voice (at times in tune, at times not), and butch demeanor, did create a sex-symbol, but instead another tragic character. While I agree, the story isn't conducive to happiness; somebody should have considered it as an opportunity to see these characters differently. It would have added a new layer to their characters, allowing for a stronger emotional punch at the end.As our characters floundered through their roles, playing piano and off-beat singing, the story was another part that just fell short &#x96; forcing our characters to have mixed material to work with and missed character opportunity. The Fabulous Baker Boys as a film doesn't work, as a television mini-series perhaps it would have been better. There is too much left on the table from writer-director Kloves that nothing evolves. Scenes like upstairs neighbor of Jeff's that is like his mother, busting the dog out of the vet, smelling bathroom equipment, and destroying memorabilia, look good on paper, but without the correct backing just doesn't feel finished. That is the overall feel with Baker Boys, a sense that scenes, moments, and plot-points went unfinished. Kloves isn't the best in handling the talent he has hired. From leaving cameramen in shots to overusing the piano music, Kloves believes in his work (there is no argument there), but his execution is fallible. Why would you use piano music as your theme music when the Bridges are playing piano music as well? This was horrible. With strong keys being played by the brothers, the cheesy background music just diluted the overall feel. It is the perfect example of having authentic reality and a cheap knock-off. With lacking characters, it would be up to Kloves to cover the differences, but he can't control what is happening. His camera direction, musical focus, and story have too many flawed plot holes that instead of a creative story, we are left with a sad overused cliché. I would agree that these boys are Fabulous, but Kloves couldn't prove it. His scientific directional equation remains a hypothesis.Overall, I wasn't a fan of this film. Our mood, music, and plot points were all misused and poorly developed. Our story, cliché after cliché, didn't feel original or exciting. There needed to be some brightness at the end of our tunnel, but nobody could demonstrate this. It was corrosive and disappointing.Grade * ½ out of ***** "}]
