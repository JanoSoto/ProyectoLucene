This said, the central question of whether she was a saint, an inspired lunatic, wholly mentally ill, or simply a headstrong girl determined to grab her chances while she could is well asked. Many of the comments here assert that Besson makes it clear that the Maid was simply mentally ill, yet I read the film as deeply ambivalent about what was going on. Were her visions the hallucinations of a schizophrenic? Were they given by God? What's the difference? More questions are asked Why does an omnipotent, omniscient, all-compassionate deity allow terrible things to happen? What is the meaning of kingship - to own or to serve? What is the difference between taking the lives of individuals and killing en masse? What's the difference between Christianity and the earthly institutions of that religion? Where does conviction end and fanaticism begin? Jovavich's Jeanne is plagued by the difference between her idea of utter submission to God and the consequences of doing so; by doubt over the veracity of her visions; and by the gap between her ideals of the divine rights of kings and realpolitik. She is constantly on the verge of a nervous breakdown - is this a manifestation of her mental illness, or of her burning for God? And where's the difference between the two?The film raises more questions than it answers, and that's as it should be. It is something of a shame that Besson's film takes liberties with the facts as we understand them (though history is more often about our interpretation of events than the events themselves), but in terms of raising important questions on the nature of faith, it succeeds beyond measure.

And that is exactly what I liked the most about the movie. You can almost feel what this very young woman must have felt to be on the battlefield at this age, fighting for her vision, faith or whatever it was. Intoxicated by the battles and her mission to fight the war for god, for France. Besides from that you will see a lot of battles.

Example William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet re-released in 1996. However, one of the greatest tragedies ever told, the story of Joan of Arc, has just been proven possible to be relateable even with time as its enemy. Luc Besson has created a fresh-feeling new version of Joan called The Messenger, a historical epic that, for better or worse, concentrates mostly on visual style and realistic war scenes rather than answering questions we don't already know about the characters in focus here. 	The historical Joan of Arc was a poor young French woman, who believed that there were spiritual signs that ordered her to be a messenger to aid the King of France to victory on the battle field. According to The Messenger The Story of Joan of Arc, Charles VII, married to the bitter Yolande D'Aragon, was very grateful of her assistance at the time, especially when Joan explained that God has sent her to lead French troops to war with the English and be victorious. 	The visions seen (or imagined) by Joan are clearly brought to life here, with more effective qualities than ever before in a Joan of Arc picture. They are filmed with many unusual special effects, bizarre camera tricks, and a beautifully crafted atmosphere of imagery. In use with these elements to the credit of the depicted scenes, they do a good job of expressing the spiritual dream-like moments through Joan with an imaginative feeling of majesty and revealing emotion. The style, camera, and direction all contribute to making these sequences of the best material in the production.	The film was shot in the Czech Republic, as well as the country of France. Cinematographer Thierry Arbogast captures the courageous historical time period flawlessly in these locations. The battle scenes may get little off track at times; some sequences are meant more for brutality purposes rather than a strong, focused narrative story. 	The actors interpret their characters with a precise energetic edge. Milla Jovovich has the ability to be a believable Joan of Arc, but does push the limit on convincing us. Some of the film's efforts are straining toward the idea that Joan was somewhat mentally retarded-and Jovovich does a great job presenting that. Other familiar faces found in The Messenger The Story of Joan of Arc include John Malkovich as King Charles VII, and Faye Dunaway as his spouse, Yolande D'Aragon. Also the legendary Dustin Hoffman inhabits a brief but appropriate role as the Grand Inquisitor, and Pascal Greggory is The Duke of Alen√ßon.	There are scenes in this movie that make the audience stare at the screen in awe, but also scenes that make us ask ourselves questions. Although much of the production is spent on developing Joan's character and motives, the film still doesn't manage to answer some questions being asked by viewers pondering minds. We never learn if the visions Joan experienced were a calling from God, or just a figment of her intellectual imagination. Was Joan really crazy, or only near eccentric? Were the physical objects that Joan felt were signs from a higher spirit actually what she thought they were?  An ulterior source could have been Lucifer deceiving the trusting Joan. Or did the French actually triumph in battles because of the spiritual strength accorded by Joan, or was luck the element present?  And I personally would have like a little more explanation of the Grand Inquisitor character. The Messenger The Story of Joan of Arc is a serious dramatic tragedy, and it takes itself as that all of the time. Luc Besson has constructed a movie that is ambitious and inspiring, with no room for the compromising or modest. I recommend the picture weather you're a new comer or a veteran to the Joan of Arc mythology.  Even if you already know the story of Joan of Arc like the back of your hand, this telling might just surprise you.Brought to you by Columbia Pictures.

Since it is, however, a recounting of one of the world's most famous stories of military triumph and personal tragedy, the film actually generates the most interest when it concentrates on just those mind-boggling historical incredibilities.Joan was, of course, the deeply devout, illiterate peasant girl who, spurred on by what she claimed were visions and voices sent directly by God - assuring her and France of a glorious victory over the advancing forces of the invading English army - managed to convince a desperate monarch to have her lead an army into the field, despite the fact that she brought with her no previous battle experience or even a rudimentary knowledge of the use of weapons in combat.   We first see her as a young girl, strangely obsessed with religious piety, attending confession daily, running through the woods in a mad frenzy of ecstasy, encountering strange, inexplicable visions along the way, and, eventually, being driven to an intense hatred of the British by the rape and murder of her beloved older sister.  We see the French royalty, so driven to desperation by the seemingly inexorable encroachment of the brutal British onto their native soil, that they lend credence to this child and give in to her demands, sending her out to lead the troops into what turns out to be some truly miraculous routs and victories.  But glory is, more often than not, an ineffable entity that is lost as quickly as it is gained &#150; and Joan learns tragically that, once her original goal of restoring the French monarch to his throne is achieved, her services are no longer of value, and she is allowed to be captured by the English, tried by the Catholic Church, and burned at the stake by the English government for the crime of witchcraft.Given this fascinating and astonishing series of events, it would be difficult to make a film completely lacking in interest and insight.  And, indeed, `The Messenger' is, perhaps, a better film than many of the harsh, almost bitter reviews by many critics would indicate.  The first half of the film is a rather conventional telling of the tale.  The warrior Joan often comes across as a shrill, petulant adolescent who somehow never convinces us that she is, indeed, someone all these military strategists would follow. But, about midway through the film, the screenwriters, Andrew Birkin and writer/director Besson, begin to apply some psychological depth to the character.  After a particularly sanguine encounter with the English, in which hundreds of decapitated and limbless corpses strew the blood-soaked ground, Joan breaks down in despair over the horrifying inhumanity of the sight.  From then on, her actions arise from a paradoxical conflict occurring within the very core of her being - between the righteousness of her pious cause, the pacifistic teachings of Christ and her single-minded devotion to her king and country.  When she is finally captured and held in prison before and during her trial, she begins to question the veracity of her visions and to ponder whether the motivation for her cause really lay in divine inspiration or an obsession for personal glory and power.  We're a long way from the astute psychological insights of Carl Dreyer's classic silent film version of the story, `The Passion of Jeanne d'Arc,' but `The Messenger' does take occasional time out from its action sequences to attempt to explore the question of whether Joan's miracles were the product of divine intervention or of mere happenstance and chance coupled with a determination and passion borne of insanity.  Unfortunately, casting Dustin Hoffman as the Voice of Conscience who visits her in her cell and speaks for the side of reason as she descends more and more into seeming madness, renders much of this otherwise fascinating section faintly ludicrous. Every time his overly familiar face and voice arrive on the scene, we are immediately thrust out of the context of the story and find ourselves tempted to giggle out loud &#150; hardly the tone one wants to establish as Joan of Arc marches grimly to the stake.   Also, much of what he utters rings false in the context of the film's era; he sounds like he is mouthing psychobabble that would not arrive on the scene for at least another five hundred years.In terms of dialogue, historical films have always it seems had to face an inevitable Hobson's Choice  should the writers employ language that reflects the reality of the time, thereby making the characters sound stilted or dated by today's standards, or should the authors resort to the use of more modern vernacular, enhancing the immediacy of the story, perhaps, but also possibly creating an uncomfortable and awkward sense of anachronism that weakens the verisimilitude of the film so painstakingly established by the elaborate set decoration and costume design of the film? The writers of `The Messenger' have, for the most part, taken the latter course, leading to mood-shattering declarations by the characters such as `she's nuts!' and `I'm gonna kill that f------ bitch' along with a barrage of four-letter word expletives with which no contemporary PG-13 or R-rated feature could ever do without.Those with a queasiness when it comes to movie violence had best be forewarned  the battle scenes, though expertly shot and edited, register high on the bloodletting scale.Of the performers, none matches in quality the exquisite photography, art direction or costume design that adorn the film.   Milla Jovovich is, at best, adequate as Joan, rarely giving more than a surface interpretation of the complex psychological struggles occurring at the root of her personality.  John Malkovich, as the would-be French king, for whose throne Joan lays her life on the line, has his moments, but the part is not really big enough in the context of the film to allow him to create a multifaceted performance.  Faye Dunaway brings a cool, subtle intensity to her role as the future king's manipulative mother-in-law.`The Messenger' emerges as an ultimately unsatisfying mixture of faults and virtues, yet, because it has such a fascinating story to tell, the film is far more interesting than the brutally hostile reviews that greeted the work's initial release would lead one to believe.

I think without that, it probably would have been a much duller movie, although probably entertaining.The battles scenes, of which there were many, were graphic and brutal. Dismemberments, swords and maces swinging, lots of pain and death. The ensuing desolation at the end of a battle were weighty and gave a a horrible look at the conditions of the time.My final impressions... Joan of Arc, if the portrayals were accurate was a driven young woman, deeply religious and deeply confused who was probably at least partially insane. If she were alive today, no doubt, she would be treated with common drugs and would lead a normal life. I felt very sorry for her and her situation and for the way that she was treated. I know people would argue that there is no need to feel this way, because she was clear and sure of her purpose. I don't feel that this was ever the case and she was sure only that she was going crazy if she didn't do something.Movies don't usually move me this way and I'm really amazed.

Like all of Besson's films, The Messenger is highly stylized, nicely cast, and visually powerful. The film is also forgivably anachronistic in terms of language while developing a strong period feel through sets and costume. Joan was, of course, the deeply religious teenage girl who lead Prince Charles' army to improbable victory over the invading English at Orleans and helped re-consolidate French sovereignty. Joan considered herself God's appointed messenger, and France apparently saw her as an avenging angel. Today, she is commonly regarded as a schizophrenic. She was canonized in the 1950s, 500 years after her death. Regardless of whether God or insanity was the source of her strength, power, will and incredible courage - there is little ambiguity about her role in the salvation of France nor the fate that awaited her afterward. In general, the acting is quite good. Jovovich's much-maligned performance is actually very good and exactly appropriate for what Besson was trying to do with the film. Comparing Joan of Arc to her other Messianic role as Leelu in the Fifth Element is, frankly, ridiculous. I believe that the problems people find in Jovovich's performance are problems those same people bring to the film. Malkovich and Dunaway are phenomenal. Tcheky Karyo and Vincent Cassell provide excellent support. Besson strays from what we think we know about the details of Joan's story, but only to present the truth of the big-picture more accurately. His film steadfastly refuses to answer the questions many people will bring to it * Was Joan schizophrenic? * Was she a catholic messiah or divinely inspired prophet?Why is Besson so careful about accurately presenting the ambiguity of the story? I think he wanted to make a moving film, but not a film which would unsubtly challenge its audience's beliefs. If you do not believe, you will tend to explain Dustin Hoffman's character as a manifestation of Joan's psychological problems. If you do believe, you may want to think of him as Satan, am angel, perhaps both. Thus, Besson, who is a deeply spiritual person, makes a powerful statement about faith through his metanarrative while maintaining an appropriately unevangelical position. He took similar paths in his more uplifting films The Fifth Element and Angel-A.Highly recommended for Besson and Jovovich fans. Not a biography - avoid this if you must have the plain facts! Mildly recommended as a piece of historical fiction.

It looks great but the basic story gets lost in the histrionics and excess. There really was a very religious young girl who was considered a savior to France during The Hundred Years War. Although things may have eventually sorted themselves out the same way without her. Three years after her birth, the new tactics of the English archers were responsible for arguably the most one-sided battle in military history at Agincourt. The result was credited to Henry V's piety and he got a great passage in Shakespeare. The French aristocracy was almost wiped out by the battle and the English became solidly entrenched in France. Fourteen years later a new generation of French nobility was beginning to assert itself and it was the English and their French allies who were having leadership problems. Both countries were Catholic at the time and both claimed that God was on their side, a bit like the football player who thanks God for the victory over another team that apparently God did not favor. Although there are records of both of Joan's trials (her Condemnation Trial and her Rehabilitation Trial) both proceedings had their own political agenda and should be taken with a grain of salt. Besson's film seems to follow the generally accepted version of the story but takes obvious liberties with Joan's mental condition and visions. There is no way to prove or disprove any of this so it is probably as plausible as any other speculation. What hurts The Messenger The Story of Joan of Arc is that Besson's best scenes are at the very beginning and set too high a standard for the remainder of the film. Jane Valentine is wonderful as the young Joan and Besson shows that his directing skills with young actors was not confined to Natalie Portman's performance in Leon. This early stuff features some of the most interesting scene juxtaposition that you are likely to see in any film. IMHO it gets off to a better start than any film in cinema history. And the sequence where the young Joan is standing on a hill watching as the English burn her village is as visually stunning as anything ever filmed.But once Milla Jovovich's grown-up Joan takes over most viewers will find it difficult to stay focused on the story. It's not miscasting, Jovovich is noted for aggressive and daring performances (see The Dummy) rather than subtlety and nuance, making her a good fit for the take Besson wanted on Joan's personality. The problem is that while a viewer could identify with the young Joan, the older Joan is just repellent. Her story should be inspirational and tragic. Instead it is a bunch of comic book battle scenes and comical melodrama. But it is worth watching for the production design and the beginning sequences. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.

The murder/rape (in that order) a few minutes later confirmed my first impression, but for some reason I stayed.Maybe I stayed because I teach classes on film and watch a lot of movies, and I am more than willing to give ANY film a fair shot (and sometimes two or three).  I wanted this film to succeed.  But it falls down on so many levels that I felt my own calling from God, as it were, to wage a small battle against it.The reviews published by the San Francisco papers, NY Times and Chicago Sun-Times (Ebert) give a pretty good summary of what's wrong with this film, even though I think their two stars ratings are quite generous.To summarize my own thoughts on the film, I feel that the script doesn't know what story it's trying to tell, and Besson and Jovovich seem to have no sense at all for the complexities of Joan's story, as it has come down to us.The acting is as overwrought and void of subtlety as any I've seen in a long time.  The only highlights are a couple of performances from supporting characters (who unfortunately are shackled by the poor screenplay) and Dustin Hoffman's appearance toward the end of the film (way too little, way too late to save the film).  I felt particularly saddened by the clownish performance John Malkovich gives, although I can't help but think/hope that he was forced to do it by Besson.  (I wondered while watching the scene where Joan tells Charles about her revelations whether Malkovich was mocking Jovovich . . . and the whole production for that matter.)Everything else you see in the film (art direction, costume design, soundtrack, special effects, even the look of every single supporting and bit player, etc. etc.) is as cliche and unimaginative as the screenplay and acting.  It feels as if Besson and Co. sat down and said, What is the absolutely most stereotypical image that the average moviegoer who knows nothing about 15th-century France or Joan of Arc or who has never thought about spiritual things in a meaningful way will expect when he or she sits down to watch this film?

The poetic license that was taken with the real story took away from the intent of the movie. The mystical scenes where Joan was hearing voices or getting spiritual revelations were more like Natural Born Killers meet the Dark Ages. Oliver Stone must have been consulted on these. The historical inaccuracies were abundant, such at the disgusting rape of Joan's sister, which she, in actuality, did not have. We know little of the appearance of the relevations she had, but I am sure they were nothing like depicted - which evidently had some hidden meaning that the average movie goer will never be able to figure out.The movie was destroyed by the Mila Jovovich as Joan. Most of the scences with her resembled footage from the Blair Witch Project more than a portrayal of St. Joan of Arc. She has little acting ability and her overdone performance absolutely ruined the movie. I do not feel that someone as strong as Joan and as religiously committed would have continually been on the verge of hysteria almost to the point of having a seizure.I still do not know what compelled me to sit through the whole movie. I have not seen anything this bad since the early 1980's remake of 1984.Had the movie paid more attention to historical data, de-emphasized those speculated vision scenes, and used a legitimate actress - like Leelee Sobieski in the TV mini-series - this movie would have been a great success.This movie portrayed Joan as a confused, hysterical, psychotic. The real Joan would have never been able to accomplish what she did, even to the point of being martyred with such spiritual and confident serenity if she was actually like the movie Joan.Use your bonus rental at your favorite video store rather than pay good money to see this bit of glitzy trash.

While it is fact that Joan's town was raided several times and on one occasion burned by the English; Joan of Arc had 2 brothers, but no sisters. This alone was enough to ruin the movie for me, since Besson proceeds to build a case that all of Joan's actions and her descent into insanity were caused by the horrific death of her sister.Besson also inexplicably created a sinister tormentor for Joan, played by Dustine Hoffman. Hoffman's character who continually played the devil's advocate to a clearly insane Joan, was just plain annoying, confusing, and yet another fabrication. Besson's Joan was never seen having the visions of St. Margaret, St. Catherine, and St. Michael which the real Joan of Arc was reported to have. Instead she saw a twisted and almost demonic Christ figure and the strange Dustin Hoffman character. For Besson to portray a saint and a French national hero in such a manner was purely offensive and in poor taste. Had Besson actually bothered to base his story on historical fact I may have felt differently.

She plays the role with a completely one-dimensional fanatical gusto that is sometimes comical, but is more often grating.Second is the direction and the screenplay.

I actually started to want to see Joan of Arc being burned at the stake, because that would mark the end of the movie, and my suffering through this terrible piece of cinema would finally be finished.If you must see a Joan of Arc movie, see Carl Dreyer's silent masterpiece The Passion of the Joan of Arc, and accept no substitute.

I must fully agree with it. Although I am no Joan's biographer, the facts that I know from her life were so deformed here that I wonder why Frenchmen didn't burn the director on a stockpile instead of her. By the way, I must laugh, when I remember the concealment around the filming of Besson's Joan in northern Moravia. No man including Martians could get there. Why did they actually hide there? Perhaps they wanted to keep back from people, what a trash they are just shooting.Besson and his exwife allegedly undertook a deep investigation (only Gods know, where) and this French-Ukrainian collaboration resulted in a title, where Joan of Arc is demythicized and depicted as a furious psychotic, who runs through the screen with a staring look and even beats her soldiers with a fist (yes, here it is really possible). Poor villagers at the trial in Rouen probably lied and Besson with Jovovich revealed a big historical fraud. One thing that I can't understand is why there are so many people that can call this unbelievable garbage a moving masterpiece. Maybe there is a lot of ignorants, who know nothing about the historical reality and maybe they have only a foggy idea about the position of France, but despite that I can't believe that somebody could think that French soldiers could follow a lunatic like this.I am very sorry for director Marshall, who also planned a movie about Joan, but he was probably forced to put off its realization because of this silly emanation that was quicker. The Joan with Leelee Sobieski was certainly better, but Leelee simply lacks enough charisma (Although otherwise she is a very pretty and sympathetic girl, of course.)Maybe Besson will soon make a similar biographical movie about Mother Theresa, where he will definitively demythicize her as a deviant monster abusing little Indian children. I am looking forward to positive comments on this exciting masterpiece.

Her convictions and faith were questioned through torturing but she had held them all the way through. The subtle portrayal of God himself was conspicuous. Joan was manipulated and ultimately burned at the stake, that is God let these things happened to her after she fulfilled his mission. One would think that God should have rewarded her for defeating the English, but rather he let her die at the hands of them.But still Joan of Arc carries the message of God with her even after centuries has passed.

The rest of the movie was something else again.It seems to me Besson and his co-writer, Andrew Birkin, were trying to do what Kenneth Branagh did in his version of HAMLET; look at the lead character not as an icon, but as a normal human being, and try to explain their actions and behavior in that context.  Admittedly, since I am unfamiliar with this story, I am more receptive to this approach than those who hold Joan as an icon, but I would have been more than willing to watch a movie which handled this material well.  Unfortunately, once Besson established which way he wanted to go, he seemed unsure of how to get there.  Most of the drama is handled on a third-grade level(especially her trial), and we never really get into what made Joan tick.  Though the scenes with Dustin Hoffman were involving, especially since he was so good, they too fell short in explaining Joan.  And Jovovich can't quite access those depths yet.The rest of the cast is okay.  Malkovich and Faye Dunaway are playing types, but they play them well enough.  Tchecky Kayro(I know I'm not spelling that right) and Vincent Cassel lend a sense of gravity to their roles as soldiers.  But all in all, this is a movie whose reach was beyond its grasp.

The battle sequences are also well done, showing that warfare has always been a hell on Earth.

But that's a small problem compared to others found in the movie. The main problem with the movie is that for the most part it's too long and too slow, though there are curiously some important details here and there that are not examined in enough depth, not just the one I mentioned earlier. Another problem is that Joan in this movie often comes across as abrasive and obnoxious.

Well, I wouldn't call it that bad, but still... it hardly gave me any faith in Milla's career as a dramatic performer.So I popped this flick in the DVD player not expecting much. Sacr√©e merde! What a surprise. It seems, stripped of her futuristic-mutant-motorcycle-riding-vampire persona, she's really quite good. This film--probably the least glamorous of her entire repertoire--really gives her a chance to show her full dynamics. I can't say much more without giving away the plot, so I'll drop it for now.Now on to the director Luc Besson. For the first half hour or so, he seems to suffer from I wanna be Kenneth Branagh syndrome (which is almost as painful as the avian flu). We get a dozen scenes of someone running down a corridor with the camera chasing behind. We get a dozen overhead-camera-twirly shots of someone lying on the ground. We get so many crane shots, you start thinking you're on a construction site. What's wrong with all this? I'll tell you. When the camera swings & sways too much it detracts from the actors' performances. Sure it adds visual drama, but so can a good fireworks scene (with just as much subtlety).But suddenly, right around the halfway mark, the camera man simmers down. The whole tone of the film changes, becomes darker and more intense, relying on the power of the actors instead of the gimmicky camera-work. This works brilliantly, especially when Dustin Hoffman finally steps in.This is the break that takes the movie in an entirely different (and possibly offensive) direction. It looks like some IMDb reviewers weren't too happy. I'm sure plenty of others got bored (because the swordfights stop). But me, I thought this change of mood was what made the movie. Suddenly it becomes a spooky, psychological thriller with a lot of great dialogue and a ton of good acting. THIS is the payoff.My biggest gripe with the movie is that after seeing the 2nd half, I kept saying to myself why the hell did Besson waste so much time getting here? There were a few too many insignificant fluff scenes in the beginning (like the virginity test lol) that should have been replaced with more of the powerful Milla-Dustin dialogue toward the end.I won't comment on historical accuracy, religious sacrilege, lack-of-realism or the fact that there were a few too many American accents for 15th century France. These flaws fall by the wayside if you're instead paying attention to the complex conflict brewing in Milla's character. This is really her movie, and a damn good one at that.

Acting nuts like her is what it takes to inspire an entire army to fight, come on, you don't get that by acting doped and philosophical (like most saints are portraited), and those who think a saint can't be violent or enraged, remember Christ at the temple angrily chasing the salesmen away and wrecking their businesses.The demonic Christ vision well, that means not that Christ is a sick f$%#, but that Joan was starting to doubt that God would wish such carnage (maybe she afraid that feelings or rage and combat-rush were clouding her judgement, and therefore twisting her mission).Dustin Hoffman yes, he looks like a jedi knight (or a sith lord when he's in the shadows), but he's not Satan, God or Torquemada for that matter. He's the personification of Joan's doubts, insecurities and fears (the fear of seeing what we want to see and rationalizing things is real, and who's never doubted himself?).And one last thing I personally don't buy that God actually sent someone to save France from England.

In fact, I think there are things about this movie I haven't seen nowhere else, specially all the scenes where Joan hallucinates and has visions of God. This movie is totally different from all medieval adventures we have seen so far, and its shots are Luc Besson's own. The all-stellar cast helps a lot, and Dustin Hoffman turn out welcome at the end. The battle scenes are a wow!Thierry Arboghast's cinematography helps a lot to establish a cool look of medieval times, specially when fire is concerned. Eric Serra's score reaches depth levels he has never reached before. A great film altogether, which deserves to be seen with the heart willing to take whatever we get from it. The title song My Heart Calling is one of the most beautiful Eric Serra wrote for the movies. I recommend it for Besson fans who will like certainly, and to all the others who aren't, just for the fun of a different depiction of Joan's life.

This movie was so bad it drove me out of the theatre.  Not only did I leave early, I spent the next hour sitting around in the lobby of the theatre because I was driving some friends who didn't get the sense to walk out until there was only a half hour left in this monstrosity.  You know what?  Waiting doing nothing in the lobby was far better than this hideous film.Where do I start with what was wrong?  How about the acting.  Milla was so far beyond awful it cannot be described properly.  She spends the entire film shrieking.  Not yelling, not shouting, literally shrieking, in a piercing, whiny nasal tone of voice that gave me a splitting headache (literally, not figuratively) after five minutes.  Whether you believe that Jeanne D'Arc was touched by God or not, she undeniably had the charisma to inspire her men.  I cannot believe that the men wouldn't string this version of her up!  And don't get started on how she apparently has an orgasm every time she rides her horse.The historical accuracy was non existent.  The Dauphin was a teenager, no older than Joan, and he is played by a forty-six year-old man!  The guys was three times too old!  Then we have a scene were Joan rides her horse up to an English fort, jumps the wall, rides around shrieking like a spastic harpy while the English sit around with their thumbs in their noses, and cuts the rope, lowering the gate, allowing her forces to attack.  Nothing remotely like this ever happened!We are also treated to demented concepts of medieval warfare, with giant erector-set type tubes shooting huge granite marbles out of forts into attacking men.  Real medieval warfare was terrible enough, why add this nonsense to it, making it a humourless joke.And here's a question if the point of the movie was to be that Joan was just a revenge-obsessed lunatic, why did they show her getting a literally un-survivable arrow wound, instead of the much less lethal one she actually recieved?This movie is an insult to the French people and to Christians, both of which I can live with, as I am neither.

His film, The Messenger, may yet be the most psychologically accurate account of the story of Jeanne d'Arc.  Besson attempts to rationalise her actions and with stunning reality.Behind her armour, Besson speculates that Jeanne d'Arc is simply another victim of war, so tramatised that her questionable sanity led her country to victory, at least for a while.  He also went on and modelled the other characters as people who care about nothing but themselves, not common even by to-day's standards.Beyond its value as a psycho-drama, however, the film is simply supported by a series of fight scenes with lots of armour, impressive siege weapons, and blood and gore.  Besson focused too much into Jeanne's psyche that there was not enough time for the characters to develop, including Jeanne herself. As a result, the film seems empty, the plot linear, and the acting mechanical.The way Besson divided the film, I often could not help myself but to associate it with George Orwell's novel 1984.  There are striking similarities between the two work, both in structure and context which makes me wonder if this is where he drew his inspiration.Despite the use modernised language (that is, fudge, sheet, etc.,) The Messenger is reasonable entertainment for those who thrives on realism, but are not too interested in any in-depth post-movie discussion.

At least I felt that after watching it. It's a very strange, quite unusual biographical epic, with many good things and some bad things.After a small explanation of the situation of France that time (the war with England for the French territory), the film starts showing a pre-adolescent Jeanne (or Joan, as you wish) confessing in a church of her village. She claims that she has some visions in which a boy tells her what to do. Some minutes after, in a field, she has one of those visions and, when she 'wakes up' the English soldiers are destroying her village. She sees her sister being killed, then raped by a soldier, and after the funeral she goes to live with her uncles in another village. Jeanne seems very shocked with everything, but continues having visions. Some years pass, and Charles VII, who is to become king, is told that a young woman who claims to have visions in which she sees God, is coming to see him in order to be a soldier of the French army. He seems a little confused with this, but the only way for him to become the king of France is to win the war against England, and for that he has to accept Jeanne as a soldier. She cumplishes her mission and faces the English soldiers. In the middle of all that, she continues having visions and things starts to get confusing and dangerous for her.The story is not so hard to follow as in other epic films (as Elizabeth), but the film is quite. The first one hour is very interesting, but then come the battle scenes and these are just tedious. They show many headless bodies, blood, but can't escape from being boring. It's the worst part of the film and I felt tempted to leave the movies. However, the last 40 minutes are very beautiful. The ending is wonderful and lets us with many questions about who was Joan of Arc in fact and what her visions meant.The acting in The Messenger is great, specially from the supporting actors. John Malkovich, Faye Dunaway and Dustin Hoffman all give solid performances. And there's Milla Jovovich. Well, her acting is another thing on the film that is quite difficult to form an opinion about. She shows talent in the scenes of visions, but she can be annoying when she yells. Overall she did a pretty decent job.The Messenger has everything an epic should have beautiful costumes, wonderful art-direction, good music, beautiful photography, etc. Luc Besson's directing is also efficient. But I still think it's difficult to say what I really thought of the film. For now, I give it a nice 7/10, because I wasn't really disappointed, but of course it could have been much better.

Besson borrows quite a little from other writers and directors in this film but his chief borrowing is from 20th and 21st Century psychiatry. In the end, he tells viewers through Joan's visible conscience (portrayed by Dustin Hoffman) that her voices were the product of hysteria and that the Messenger from God simply told her what she wanted to hear. To make this approach credible, Besson introduces the murder and subsequent rape of Joan's elder sister, which she witnesses when she is 10 years old through cracks in the door to the closest where she is hiding. Hysteria is a modern and plausible explanation for religious visions, but there is no historical evidence to serve as background -- and I found the modern day psycho-babble more than a little jarring, even though Dustin Hoffman does his best with the role. Fay Dunaway also performs very effectively but John Malkovich is John Malkovich, not the Dauphin.

He yields to her faith and soon battles begun to be won due to her inspired approach to the war.  However with the English on the retreat and Charles crowned King of France, the tone of the country changes and Joan is desired more by the English for revenge than she is by the French rulers for her victories.I came to this with an awareness of the bad reviews and I must admit that many of them have been rather harsh.  Perhaps it is your expectation &#150; I had no hopes that this would be anything other than a film and am already very accustom to `historical' films being far from the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.  So all I expected was a reasonable film which was watchable and, in fairness, that's all I got.As often is the case with Besson, the substance is very much second to style and thus the story is historically very dubious at best.  Happily the style and delivery of the film is all and he does direct it well.  The battle scenes are exciting without being as grand as we've seen it done elsewhere.  When it comes down to the politics of the beast then the film falters a bit and Besson can't deliver something that is compelling.  The last 30 minutes are a real drag and are only really redeemed by one (surprising) factor.  Contrary to the other reviews here &#150; that factor was Dustin Hoffman.While I agree that another actor could have done better, Hoffman does a good job on the most part.  His cynicism helps dispel the myth that had been build up in the previous 2 hours and is quite refreshing to have questions asked instead of just fighting.  He is a strange choice but I think his New York sceptic approach works (despite being set in medieval France).  He certainly works better than many others in the cast.  Jovovich is a beautiful blonde-haired, blue eyes peasant girl with a perfect accent and mannerisms &#150; one would have hoped she would have at least tried to be a peasant rather than a warrior princess but ho-hum.  She can't carry the role for the majority of the film and is not a good enough actress.  However other better actors also flounder with Malkovich just having a laugh, Cassel almost being a warrior clown and Dunaway looking sinister behind the scenes.Overall this is stylish enough to watch once but for God's sake don't expect a really good film, a thoughtful film or one that bares anything but a passing resemblance to the real Joan D'Arc.

Judging from his previous works, Luc Besson had such potential with The Messenger.  The bad things (casting the lead role, minor discrepancies and spaces in history, and explicit gore) outweigh the good things (supporting cast and beautiful scenery) by far.Milla Jovovich is a very talented actress, but Joan of Arc she is not. As the wife of Luc Besson, she seemed to be the best choice for the part. She was very entertaining as the bandage-clad, red-haired alien Leeloo in The Fifth Element. Her wide-eyed portrayal of Joan in The Messenger made her seem more like a crazy wench suffering from premenstrual syndrome than a visionary with a mission from God. A better choice for the Joan of Arc role would have been Claire Danes. At least she would have been sure to keep her hair color consistent throughout the movie.There is nothing in the history books that indicate that Joan's sister Catherine was raped and killed by English soldiers in the attack on the village. Although it was the most realistic scene in the movie, it most likely never happened.  It was presented that Joan used the brutal death of her sister as an act of self-serving vengeance, not simply being chosen by God through her visions to lead the French to victory over the English. Other research reveals that Joan was raped while in prison, just so she would not die the virgin martyr.The movie makes a big leap from Joan's childhood to stalking the Dauphin. The last scene of Joan as a child is her escape from the back of her uncle's wagon to return to the church. The very next scene is her meeting with the Dauphin Charles VII. What happened to her during those eight or nine years between scenes? How did she develop a bond with the people who were so willing to accept her as a messenger of God? Joan's army had great respect for her from the beginning, but no explanation was given as to why.What about the brutality of war? The blood and gore depicted in this movie had no purpose other than pure shock effect. Wolves devour the entrails of a dead peasant. Young Joan witnesses the bloody impaling and rape of her sister's dead body while trapped in a closet. Soldiers heads are lopped off in blood-spurting glamor, twice, in the midst of the yawn-inspiring battle scenes. The fighting scenes lacked the camaraderie, fluidity and intestinal fortitude portrayed so well in Braveheart.The supporting cast did an excellent job trying to salvage what was left of the movie. Jane Valentine, who portrayed Joan as a child, gave a radiant performance, much more so than her older counterpart. John Malkovich did a superb job, as always, convincing the audience he belonged there. Faye Dunaway precisely performed the role of Charles VII's manipulative mother-in-law. Even though the Dustin Hoffman scenes required spectators to look up his nose the whole time, he played the part of Joan's conscience with his Oscar-winning ability.The country scenes were absolutely breathtaking. Who would not love the opportunity to run freely through tall grass, fields of flowers and unadulterated forests? This was the best part of the movie. It is good to know that places like this still exist in the world, unscathed by modern technology.Overall this movie lacked transition, a strong lead character and a sensible plot. It was the longest two hours and twenty-one minutes I have had to sit through in a quite a while. I give it a D+.

The plot is great, and it has a very good pace. I am almost never bored when watching this film, despite the fact that it's fairly long(about two and a half hours long), and I've seen it at least half a dozen times. What I've found to be great about the film is the re-watchable quality it has; I've seen it many times, yet I haven't grown tired of it. Up to the very end, it always has a scene or two that you can look forward to, either because it's exceptionally well done, has very good cinematography, has great acting and/or dialog, or every one of those qualities. The acting is great. Every single actor gives a great performance, even the child actors were convincing. The performances that impressed me the most, however, were those of Milla Jovovich and Dustin Hoffman, as Jeanne and her conscience, respectively. They never cease to amaze me. The characters were well-written and credible. I particularly liked the way Jeanne was written as having a very notable temper and being very decisive. I also very much enjoyed the various supporting characters, the best being La Hire and The Conscience. I liked the way the film seems to question Jeanne's sanity; whereas most believe that she *was* in fact, sent by God, this film sits down and asks the question, if she really was, or if the signs and miracles weren't all in her head, and caused by everyone wanting to believe it. The very last scenes especially puts doubt in the viewer. It was quite a gutsy move by Besson, to question his own country's hero. I will admit, the film does really make it seem more like she is crazy rather than sent by God, but it doesn't feel like Besson is pushing his view onto us, telling us that that's the way it was; it feels more like he tries to make us question it. The action and the war scenes were very well done, very chaotic and disturbing, very intense and bloody. This isn't the best war movie ever made, nor is it the most factually accurate; it might not even be the best retelling of the legend of Jeanne d'Arc. But I have found it to be a thoroughly enjoyable, well-acted, well-choreographed, well-done film that makes you think. And that's good enough for me. Several scenes are quite memorable, as are some of the lines. All in all, a very enjoyable war-drama, with an authentic story and some well-done battle sequences. I recommend it to fans of the actors, of Luc Besson's other work and of war movies/dramas in general. Just don't expect a full-out war movie; it's two hours and thirty minutes long, and I don't think more than forty-five minutes in total are spent fighting. 7/10 "},{"Title":"Pretty bad, for so many reasons","Date":"18 March 2016","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Biography, Drama","Review":" 1429.

The result is Joan of Arc as misguided child, Joan of Arc as psychotic young woman. These criticisms for what they are worth do not help make the film entertaining. While I was initially taken by the historical detail, I ended up spending most of my time wondering how France could have fallen for this child. Hunger Games, for a modern example, presents a much more credible heroine who is used by the powers that be for their own ends. That to me is an interesting story that has emotional content. Joan of Arc the film raises interesting questions but it is not entertaining or moving and I suppose in the end when a girl gets burned at the stake I want to be moved.

French place names compete for our attention as blood seeps over the obscure territory, presumably representing English invasion. All this when a simple date would tell us as much as we need to know. Then there is a wonderful series of establishing shots, rendering all the previous text unnecessary. Here is medieval agrarian France, here is the title character, here, her conflicted relationships with the Church & God, the ambiguity of what is real, what is visionary. A melange of differing accents alerts us that we are dealing with an ensemble cast. Then John Malkovich, Faye Dunaway, and Dustin Hoffman remind us again. Americans in medieval France...hmmm. Of the three, Dunaway seems the most at home in her role. Hoffman...does anyone ever forget he is watching Hoffman? Jack Crabb is the last role I saw as a character and not Hoffman-in-a-role. My point isn't to disparage his acting, but that the casting director has placed too-high-profile actors in supporting roles. With Hoffman, the question is never what will the character do next, but rather, what will Hoffman do with the character. Milla is nearly perfect for the part - wild eyed volatile delusional virginal zealot, not much different from her roles in other films (Fifth Element). But one almost waits for her to go off on a rant in Ukrainian. Has a French actress ever played this role in an English language film? I liked the props and most of the sets. Much of the photography is beautiful, but there is a visually disturbing lack of roads leading to some of the castles. And in the end, the story runs down without reaching a memorable conclusion. Or maybe I dozed off.

The Leelee Sobieski miniseries was more my taste, and I really liked her in it.Jane Valentine did an impressive job as the young Jeanne and I was hoping for a family movie, but those first few minutes, while entertaining and even humorous, weren't typical of what this movie had to offer.Milla Jovovich did a good job when she was frightened, and this may have been how this Joan of Arc was supposed to be. Because she kept seeing visions of a bearded man who was always disappointed in her efforts, even though she seemed to be doing everything God had asked her to, and she even accomplished some great things. But one thing about Jovovich stood out to me when she was angry, she seemed more like a spoiled child than one of the greatest women of history.Dustin Hoffman stood out more than anyone else, as that bearded man who seemed to appear only to Joan and did nothing but criticize. I didn't recognize him at first, but later even with the hood I realized I knew that face. And as always he impressed.There was humor occasionally--how could there not be? This young girl thinks she can tell these tough men what to do in that day and age. But this was a historical film about a time of war and it's pretty much what one might expect. Not my taste, but it will certainly be good to someone.

Her sister was never killed by the English. Joan is portrayed in battle as nervous and almost hysterical, whereas she actually was cool, calm, and collected, making quick, sensible tactical decisions in battle and had the ability to inspire and lead her troops, which led to her raising the siege of Orleans, the victory at Patay, etc. Her commanders, like the Duc D'Alencon, were amazed at her ability to place artillery and troops in the siege of a castle.One of her most famous quotes was, on the occasion of the English retreating toward Paris, Have good spurs! When her commanders asked her, you mean retreat? And Joan responded, No! Chase them, for that you'll need good spurs!Joan never intentionally killed anyone in battle, as she testified at her trial. She did have a sword but always preferred to carry her white standard (banner). After the Battle of Patay, she comforted a dying English soldier, and had him be confessed before he died. She charged the English once with the French mercenary, La Hire, and her horse could have trampled somebody in that case, but that was just war.It is implied at the end of the movie that Joan did all her deeds out of her own pride and for revenge, something totally contrary to the record of her trial in which she never renounces that her voices were from God. Her trial, a mockery by the English who feared and hated Joan, was, by the King's request, reviewed 25 years later in the 1450's and declared null, due to all the legal errors, and Joan was completely exonerated. Many who testified at this nullification trial, like the Duc D'Alencon, knew Joan and fought beside her. This movie is really a fantasy with some good special effects on medieval warfare. I'm going to try the 4 hour TV version with Leelee Sobieski and see if it's any better.

Luc Besson should have avoided that.The story is over-long and confused at times, and having many of the players so closely resemble each other exacerbates the confusion. The battle scenes are faithful to the era, but wind up being dull due to the gore overkill - perhaps they are just too many and too long. Annoying also is the text on screen that was too small to read and in an archaic font.For a fantastic and presumably true tale, this movie fails to cash in on the inherent excitement. It took me three days to watch 3/4 of the picture, but I gave up and did not finish, because it made me not care about the ending, which I obviously knew.

In fact it is in many ways incredibly naive and superficial, even in its desire to look and sound profound. Profundity is not only political gibberish diplomatic slang. And it is that kind of language that reduces the attitude of the French king to be and then king to opportunism. And it is that kind of language that reduces the attitude of bishop Cochon to servile non-commitment. And it is that kind of language that reduces the attitude of the English to vengeful cruelty. It is also very superficial to reduce simple people to blind believers of anything that sounds iffy, godlike and slightly insane, like a girl leading an army or hearing and listening to divine voices. But all that must please many simple minds indeed. It is a shame because the subject deserves a serious film, a serious approach. Shakespeare forgot to write this play. He could have written a masterpiece on the subject.

Dustin Hoffman who, as the cloaked figure seems to be her final tormentor and possible executioner, turns out to be the last person in her shrinking world to show her any selfless compassion.Luc Besson's humour is what truly breathes life to this movie including a classic scene with an English army leader tormenting the French over their Frog whore's death only to find himself running for his life from her a few minutes later as she commandeers a siege tower that she has no idea how to use.For those that complain of Luc Besson's flexibility of the known facts, you're better off reading the encyclopedia rather than watching movies.

Milla Jovovich hit a career high in The Messenger that she has never really lived up to since. What is brave about this film is that fact that it takes such a famous historical figure and does not try to deify her or make her a larger than life hero. She questions herself at every corner. She is confused half the time. Joan of arc in this film never seems to be sure of herself and is not above changing her mind at the last second like in the scene of the retracted confession. Granted, narratively this film can be a bit muddled, but as texture and atmosphere, it is hard to beat. Luc Besson has a sly wit that seems out of place here, for example the scene where an English guard asks What is she doing cut to the French fighters I don't know! The score for the Messenger is very unique, with a combination of abstract synthesized sounds and large scale orchestra and choir reminiscent of a biblical epic. I must be honest in saying that I did not entirely like this film when I first saw it in the theater, but it stuck with me, so I went back for a repeat viewing and found I liked it a lot better than I thought.

Besson turns the story of La Pucelle into the story of Besson Needs An Epic Under His Belt.Milla Jovovich obviously did little research, or she would have found out that Jeanne's hair was as black as ink.

Normally I prefer the period between 1900 and 1950 or the Roman / Greek times when I want to watch such a movie. Only when I'm almost sure that the movie that I'm about to see, and which isn't situated in one of these time periods, will be better than average, I'm willing to give it a try. That's also the reason why I saw The Messenger The Story of Joan of Arc.When in 1412 a girl called Jeanne is born in a small village in France, the Hundred Years war with England makes life very difficult. She grows up as a very religious young woman who confesses several times a day and at the age of 13, she has her first vision when she finds a sword in a field. When she returns home with it, she finds the English looting and murdering her town. Many years later, she is convinced that it is her holy duty to be ridding France of the English. That's why in 1428 she meets Charles, the Dauphin of France, who is so desperate that he accepts all help, even when it comes from a 16 year old maiden with a divine mission. After she successfully liberated Orl√©ans and Reims, the Dauphin is crowned traditionally in the cathedral of Reims. From that moment on he doesn't need her anymore, since his wishes are satisfied, and after he betrays Jeanne d'Arc, she is imprisoned by the Burgundians. They organize a trial against her under English law, but can't force her to confess about her divine visions which she has had continuously since childhood. Condemned of witchcraft and being considered as a relapsed heretic, she is sentenced to death and is burnt alive at only 19 years of age.The story is of course what it is. Because this is a movie that has been based on a biography, which already exists for a few hundred years, much can't go wrong. Only when the writers had added a lot of new elements to it, which I don't think they have done, this could have become a really awful movie. Now I had the feeling that they followed the original story pretty well and that's why this has become a more than decent movie. Sure, by today's standards this story isn't very believable, but that's not what you should keep in mind when watching it. If today someone would claim that she was sent by God to free us from evil, she would end up in a straitjacket and a mental hospital pretty soon, but all this happened in the 15th century, when people were much more religious and still believed such claims.When it comes to the battle scenes, you can expect a lot of brutal violence. A lot of dismemberment, people being hit by a large number of arrows or cut into pieces with a sword,... you will not be spared of anything of that. Personally I don't have any problem with it, because that's the way it was at the time, but I'm sure that not everybody will be able to look at it. But the entire movie isn't made up by such scenes of course. The most remarkable ones are probably those in which she has a vision. The way those were shot is really very nice and give it that extra mysterious feeling. Also worth noticing are the nice costumes and decors, which give a good impression of the time shown in the movie.The direction and the performances by the actors are the last thing that I want to tell you something about. I already knew that Luc Besson knows what a good movie should look like, but an historic drama is still something completely different from a Sci-Fi movie like The Fifth Element, in which you can let your imagination run freely, or a completely over-the-top comedy like Taxi. But what he did looked nice and that's what's the most important. Of course he also had a nice cast to work with. With people like Dustin Hoffman, Faye Dunaway and John Malkovich he had some very famous and talented actors to his disposal. But even the other actors, with Milla Jovovich on top, were much better than average.In the end this is a movie that offered plenty of entertainment, nice shots, a good story... and that's why I find the current rating of 6.3/10 too low. I would give it a rating of at least 7.5/10. In my opinion it doesn't deserve any less.

Some people say that his 'psycho-babble' is out of place in the setting, but when balancing it with the fact that it is a Besson film looking into religion and self-belief, it really hits home. Perhaps Milla's best scenes are towards the end when she starts to put across the confused, frightened and yet resolute character of Joan while under trial and when at the stake. Malkovich and Dunaway  give admirable performances with Dunaway playing almost a pantomime Evil Stepmother to perfection.

But if people came to see this movie in hopes of being more educated on the life of this treasured saint, then this is the WRONG movie for them to see! This movie, in my opinion trashed every inch of Joan's character.Now see I have grown up loving the story of Joan of Arc, so I take stuff like this personally. We all have seen movies of legendary heros such as Braveheart, The Patriot and Rob Roy...and people come out of those movies feeling patriotic because the men in the film were portrayed truly as heros...they were heros. This movie, although advertising Joan's story as a historical epic was completely deceiving. The writer made Joan look like a complete lunatic, and after sitting through 3/4s of it I was just begging for them to burn her at the stake to just get it over with. Not that I was glad that they burned the real Joan of Arc. It was the reason that Joan's character in this movie was so wacko and skittish, you just wanted to put her out of her misery. Of course, I don't blame Milla J. for acting accordingly. I think she is a moderately creditable actress, and plays this part well. She plays it well as a catalyst from the writing. The writing here is the problem as well as the over all vision. She plays Joan the lunatic well. So it's not her fault that Joan was protrayed this way. However, if I had been in the film I would have challenged the writing a bit.I normally am not the type of person to seem so critical about a movie...but I just felt that this movie was an insult to the real Joan of Arc. Historically, and period-wise the film was accurate. But the portrayl of Joan of Arc (Who was a true hero) was completely deceiving!

As for the historical facts, I know little other than the fact she was under the age of twenty when she lead the French army against the English and was eventually burned at the stake.As a movie on its own, it's not particularly good, marred heavily by director Luc Besson's overuse of wide-angled cinematography that's probably more fitting for Monty Python than a serious drama.  Pretentious imagery is all over the map, with unintentionally hiliarious scenes of Jesus Christ speaking to Joan, shouting What are you doing to me, Jeanne?  On the bright side, the battle scenes are good, the performances are decent (though Milla Jovovich kind of overdoes her part), and there's only great scene where Dustin Hoffman (as the Conscience) speculates where Joan could have gotten her sword from (you'll understand when you see it).

He portrays her not as a great fighter, but as a flawed but inspiring leader and lateral thinker.But not a leader in the same sense as, say, Mel Gibson's William Wallace in Braveheart.  She believes she is following the signs of God, though her motives are dubious to say the least.  You feel that she is just using the French army for her own murderous revenge and not just the good of her country.As a result, the long and very bloody battles against the English do not have the same sense of victory as in Braveheart.  In fact they leave a bad taste in the mouth, as they are meant to.Milla Jovovich is simply stunning as the angry, confused teenager.  I have only seen her in Resident Evil and have grown to love her style of acting, which is a crossover between theatrical and naturalistic.  She can portray kick-ass strength whilst showing great vulnerability and naivity.  A fine actress, though not to everyone's taste it seems.Even Dustin Hoffman, an actor who never fails to irritate me, (except in Midnight Cowboy, his finest hour), gives a terrifically restrained performance as Joan's inner conscience, and is excellent as a result.Faye Dunaway gives a fine understated performance, yet, surprisingly enough, it is John Malkovich who lets the team down somewhat.  Though he doesn't spoil the movie, you know he's done better work elsewhere.As a movie, it moves along at good pace, though anyone expecting a feel good movie like Braveheart beware.  Joan of Arc is not a heart-warming tale of an underdog country's victory over the tyrannical English.  This is a very affecting portrait of a flawed individual who may have used the lives of a few thousand countrymen to do battle with her own inner demons, who by chance helped lead them into liberation.A fine movie with enough good performances for repeated viewings.

I thought the story was fairly interesting, a bit odd, and I have no idea how much of it is true, but it was interesting nonetheless.  As I said I have no idea how much of this is actually historically accurate, but if this is true to the real Joan of Arc, then I've got to say, that woman was INSANE!  The way Milla Jovovich portrayed her was just crazy!  She was one insane, blood-thirsty woman!  Also, I think it's funny that she is revered as such a great hero/warrior when (according to the film) she really didn't do much other than lead the army to battle and run around with her banner/sword.  Very strange.The actors all seemed to do a pretty good job.  I'm not a huge fan of Milla Jovovich, she's ok I guess, but she seems to over-act way too much.

Again, it is 1429, and the English is reducing France to another Scotland, another Wales, another Ireland.  The English only have to cross the river Loire into southern France, and France's existence as an independant kingdom would be ended.  Only a lone French detachment at Orleans clings tenaciously and stubbornly denying the English passage to south France. In comes a girl, who has come a long way from an area that had already declared Henry VI (son of Henry V) the true king of France.  What would you do?  Would you have had her executed?  Be truthful, most people would have. This girl claims that she can save France.  Again, what would you do? It is a testament to the scheming, intriguing, and back-stabbing mentality and brillance of mind possesed by Charles (future Charles VII) that he saw and opportunity to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.  It goes without saying that French led by Joan, won at Orleans. However, it was more than just a mere military victory.  It was a moral victory.  Up to the this time, the English was always viewed as morally superior to the decadent French.  Not after this.  After this, the English were viewed as degenerate bastards, worse yet, stubborn fools. And it only took one girl to do this.  Joan of Arc (should I say Charles VII working in the shadows) undid in two years, nearly all that which had taken Henry V over 10 years to accomplish.If Mr. Bresson had put more of a devilish, conniving character of Charles VII into his movie, in addition to portraying the pompous, glory-seeking, but intolerant and bigoted character of John, Duke of Bedford, it would have made his film more understandable and perhaps enjoyable.  But doing this would mean changing the title of the movie to Charles VII, Savior of France, also starring Joan of Arc, and would you have paid money to see this?  Be truthful.  Plenty of people paid money to see the first Batman movie, which should have been titled The Joker also starring Batman.  Fiat Lux in Tenebris.

Visually, of course, it is beautiful, but Luc Besson can do that in his sleep. It is the muddled content that I have a problem with. We are given no real window into the mind of Joan, and the manner in which we experience her religious revelations doesn't really allow us to question them in the way many of the other characters do.  It could be argued that in certain key sequences Besson does encourage us to doubt her visions or at least her interpretation. So I will leave that aside. And maybe I am also hung up on the films lack of perspective on Joan herself. It never takes a clear stance on what it thinks of her. Great hero? Or maybe flawed angry woman (whose main goal is revenge) who so wants to drive the English out of France she will find the signs from God to do it. I think this latter vision is the one we are intended to adopt.  The only really inspired portion of the film (the talk between Joan and God) leads us to this postition.  I wonder if the whole idea for the film didn't start with this scene between Joan and God (who is played wonderfully by Dustin Hoffman, critical, somewhat cruel, witty (a trait not often allowed by screenwriters), maybe caring in the way of parents).  I wonder if the film might not have played better as a 45 or 30 minute short film revolving around the key scenes with God and Joan. I have one other complaint, and this one may seem petty.

At the same time, a young girl gets a message from heaven. She has been chosen to help the king of France against the English. And that girl¬¥s name was Joan Of Arc. She¬¥s the messenger of God. In the past, Luc Besson has made great films, but these days he is light years away from his old self. The Messenger is actually really bad compared his old classics La Femme Nikita and Le√≥n. The massive battle scenes are impressive to look at, but the script Besson has written is quite dull and does not get anywhere. There are no likeable characters whatsoever and the dialogue is not very intriguing.The acting is not very impressive either. Milla Jovovich gives it her all in the title role, but she¬¥s not believable as Joan. Instead she becomes irritating when she is supposed to lead her forces in the battles. Jovovich can be good when she gets the right type of roles, but this does not fit her at all.  John Malkovich, Faye Dunaway, Tch√©ky Karyo and Dustin Hoffman have all been in far better movies and delivered far better performances.In spite of a promising beginning with beautiful settings and the violent battle scenes, that reminds a lot of the rawness in Braveheart, this is a new low from Luc Besson. A film that runs to long, and during the last hour you are way to bored to actually care how things will end up for Joan Of Arc.

If you're hoping for battle scenes reminiscent of Braveheart forget it. Besson attempts to tell a grand scale story with unsatisfying small scale scenes, there is little tension after the opening. And the beautiful cinematography and taught direction so typical of his previous films is in little evidence here. Milla, as Joan, is hopelessly out of her depth as she squeaks her battle cries to the army in her command (she was mildly irritating in Besson's Fifth Element, she's a royal pain in the neck in this). Perhaps the only intriguing episode in the film is the arrival of her 'conscience' played by Hoffman - a kind of quasi zen buddhist master mirroring her selfishness.

Imagery and fantasy are a mainstay in all his films, and one either lives with it or avoids them completely. And he has never cosied up to Hollywood and its blatant commerciality either. He came close with the Fifth Element in using Bruce Willis and Chris Tucker, but he made them do it his way, make no mistake.Directors and film-makers need to be allowed their artistic license, or personal touch.

Whoever Dustin Hoffman's character was supposed to be, he saved The Messenger from a cliche ending.  Joan's agony of faith as her execution neared became the most interesting part of the film thanks to the shadowy personage who visits her in her dungeon.  The games-playing in these scenes, which Hoffman and Milla Jovavich enact so well, makes them prime material for student actors.  Then there is the portrayal of the opposite voices of Joan's conscience ... God and Satan ... that few actors could have carried off so powerfully as Dustin Hoffman.  These scenes are truly memorable.  Much of the rest of the film is confusing.  I had a hard time understanding who were the French and who were the English in those battle scenes.  There was a nightmarish quality to the depiction of Joan's visions, which conforms to the film maker's image of Joan as a possibly demented young woman.  From what is known or suspected about the historical Joan of Arc, I think the producers and the director of The Messenger have presented us with no more or less true a Joan than can be expected from events that occurred 570 years ago.  They are within their prerogative to make her the Mad Maid of Orleans if they choose and at that they have been successful.  At the finish, however, as Joan is burning at the stake, they relent somewhat by flashing the Cross as, ostensibly, the last thing that Joan sees on this Earth.  Does this establish that Dustin Hoffman's character is God after all, or is the Cross simply one more freakish image thrown at a dying and tortured mind?

This was that kind of movie, and the stick that shoved it off the fence was the ridiculous characterization of Joan of Arc.For one thing, Joan went into battle in full armor carrying...a flag. That's it. In one scene she brandished a sword, but throughout the movie she scampered about the battleground with a damn flag instead of a weapon. In fact, several times she freaked out about her flag, Where's my flag?! I must have my flag...! Even for the crazy person the film made her out to be, this was nuts. Then there's Joan's dialogue. In one scene, as she prepared her men for battle, she uttered the inspirational and heroic lines Watch out! Be careful! I'll admit to not being Joan of Arc expert, but my guess is that it wasn't this sort of behavior that made her beloved by the people of her country.The fact is, the movie seemed as though it's purpose was to show Joan as a mentally unstable kid who didn't even take part in the battles and fighting which have made her famous. I don't know if that's true or not, but I know that when I watch a movie that's supposed to be about a heroine fighting for god and country, I expect to see her fight.Dustin Hoffman was pretty good, Mila was ok, given what she had to work with, and the battle scenes and wardrobe were very well done.

The times are hard The Hunderd Years war with England has been going on since 1337, English knights and soldiers roam the country. Joan develops into a very religious young woman, she confesses several times a day. At the age of 13, she has her first vision and finds a sword. When coming home with it, she finds the English leveling her home town. Years after that, in 1428, she (now Milla Jovovich) knows her mission is to be ridding France of the English and so sets out to meet Charles, the Dauphin. In his desperate military situation, he welcomes all help and gives the maiden a chance to prove her divine mission. After the successful liberation of Orl√©ans and Reims, the Dauphin can be crowned traditionally in the cathedral of Reims - and does not need her anymore, since his wishes are satisfied. Joan d'Arc gets set up in his trap and is imprisoned by the Burgundians. In a trial against her under English law, she can't be forced to tell about her divine visions she has had continuously since childhood. Being condemned of witchcraft and being considered as relapsed heretic, she is sentenced to death. Joan d'Arc is burnt alive in the marketplace of Rouen on May 30th, 1431, at only 19 years of age.Yes, The Messenger The Story of Joan Of Arc is a movie that has its disgusting parts (including a real-looking decapitation and a rape scene) and the coarse language doesn't suit the film, but the film certainly has more good things than bad.

In medieval France, an illiterate peasant girl, claiming to be guided by voices and visions, leaves her village to become a military leader, a tragic martyr, a national hero, and a bona fide saint.  The filmmakers succeed in offering a plausible scenario for this odd tale as it unfolds in a desperate, demoralized country, ruled by a frightened, disorganized elite who possess just the right mix of gullibility, cool calculation and deference to popular opinion.  The world of the Middle Ages--superficially so primitive and alien to our own--comes to life in a tapestry of recognizable motivations and personalities, and one is convinced that fundamentally society has not advanced in the last half-millennium as much as we would like to think.  Joan of Arc herself is portrayed as being apparently quite insane, which lends this film a dark intensity that might appeal only to fans of the mad genius genre.  Except, she's really not that much of genius--she's just mad.  It's her sheer single-minded fanaticism that moves armies.  That is a rather unsettling perspective as we ourselves leave behind a century that has given us Hitler, Stalin, and Mao, and towards the end, the film bogs down considerably in its very awkward but well-intentioned attempt to address the paradox of a warrior saint.  The answer to the riddle will likely anger Joan of Arc's modern-day admirers, be they of populist, socialist, feminist, or French Catholic variety (I sat in stunned indignation as the final credits rolled), but it's certainly food for thought.  Jovovich, as Joan, does perhaps the best she can with her character's one-dimensional fixations, but the other actors are free to be more appealing, including the affable French actor Tcheky Karyo as the bemused, exasperated, but loyal commander who is forced to work with Joan, and Desmond Harrington as the prim and serious young officer who befalls a thankless job as Joan's personal attendant.  John Malkovich is good at being John Malkovich, which works out fine here in his role as the half-baked and insecure Dauphin.  Overall, The Messenger may be too uneven, ponderous, and dark for most tastes, but if you like political intrigue, brutal medieval battles or historical soul-searching, it might be worth checking out.

Less time and effort should have went into the greusome battle scenes  and more time spent on getting the best possible performances out of the actors, especially Jeanne(Milla Jovovich) and Charles VI (John Malkovich).  Did we  really need to see all the various ways to better kill someone in a movie about a girls faith in God and her countrymen's willingness to follow her?)All I saw John Malkovich do was whine and carry on like a snivelling child. Dustin Hoffman's character was not needed, and the director had no clue how to best show Jeanne's faith and devotion to God appear believable.  Even the greatest actors need a good director to bring out the best in them.  So if anything goes wrong in a movie, it is ultimately the director's fault. Otherwise, it was a decent movie.Charle's brother and his knights were my favorite characters.

While I'm admittedly not that familiar with the historical Joan (I have a few memories of learning about her in French class many years ago), the movie to me plays heavily on the voices she hears, and the effect they have on her.

Is it a tale of a girl's struggle to reconcile faith?  Is it an action film based loosely on historical events?  In battle, Joan runs around and screams, confused and shaking most of the time.  Do we sense her torment at the momentousness of what she is leading?  No.  Instead our fearless director gives us a battle with no sense of  direction or staging.  Just running around--slicing and dicing.  He also throws in some comic relief in the form of larger-than-life soldiers who can scare away two English soldiers with just a growl (that's original).  And what of our supporting cast of accomplished actors?  They stand around most of the time acting eccentric but lack any characterization.  Joan is much the same.  There is a shallow attempt to give her motivation and some music video-esque visions, but she sings one tune throughout the entire film and Milla Jovovich lacks the acting arsenal to bring weight to the character.  There is some redemption in her conversations with Dustin Hoffman's character, but, unfortunately, that character is unnecessary to this film.  Basically, The Messenger comes off as a film with no center, no clear purpose, and turns a powerful conclusion into something you just want the film to get over with so you can get on with your life.

Also during certain scenes she acts confused and in the end she was really confused who wouldn't be, she didn't want all those people to die but this was clouded by her thoughts in that she proclaimed herself a messenger of God. In the end the viewer might think that she wasn't which is possible but with her dreams that she had those were just to vivid to pass off as chance. In my opinion she was a messenger, but one of freedom for the French. While in Braveheart William Wallace knew exactly what he was doing and what was needed to get done in order to free Scotland unlike Joan who really got more confused as the movie progressed.Great visual effects, beautiful colors, and wonderfully mixed (sound wise.)

Without getting my ass stuck in the ground, all I could say is perhaps, Milla was miscast, being she looked to aggressive for the role.  Me and (ahem) my mother both note that she was assertive, but doubt the agressivness.  If I was a soldier, I doubt I'd follow her because for the most part Milla played a partially insane Joan.  Especially towards the end... Seeing someone play Joan as if she truely were insane left a bad sting in my mouth.  But I will say this though, Milla's best scene's were towards the end anyway.

The portrayal of her early life was very good, giving her a sincerity and piety that made the child Joan an attractive character.  However, once Milla Jovovich took over as the teen Joan, she became a raving lunatic.  Clearly, this was no accident.  She and director Luc Besson are husband and wife, and it is obvious that this is their combined interpretation of Joan.The problem with this portrayal was that Joan was made to be appear so demented that she lost credibility as a believable character.  Her belief in her voices was depicted more as mad fanaticism than unshakeable faith.  Personally, I have no problem with this interpretation, since I am more apt to believe her voices were the result of an unbalanced psyche than the voice of God.  The problem I have is believing that anyone, even in the 15th century, would give an army to someone who is so obviously over the edge.  Moreover, it is a stretch to believe that even the most desperate of simple minded men would follow such a character into battle.If the portrayal were just a little more balanced, with moments of piety, sincerity and lucidity, the viewer and the other characters around her might be justified in saying, `Is she divinely inspired or simply mad?'  Only when that question resonates has Joan been portrayed effectively.  In this interpretation there was never any question.  She was clearly a madwoman.  It was almost a relief when they finally did away with her.That being said, I must say that from a technical standpoint this was a brilliantly directed film.  Luc Besson has produced a compelling visual work of art.  The opening scenes of young Joan running through the fields were exquisite.  The battle carnage was authentically grisly and the action realistic.  The costumes were wonderful and the locations and sets well chosen and well crafted.  His camera perspectives gave great impact to every scene.  His imagary of supernatural events was electrifying.  In every regard, other than Joan's character interpretation, this was an inspired work.Milla Jovovich gave a superb performance as Joan The Mad.  Though I don't agree with the interpretation, I can't imagine such insanity delivered any more effectively.  She really seemed well suited for a jacket with wrap around sleeves.  In every scene she exuded white hot intensity, especially in the battle scenes.  Her performance was truly tour de force.Faye Dunaway was fabulous as the cunning Yolande D'Aragon.  She was so nefarious and in control, deliciously evil and conniving.John Malkovich did an excellent job portraying Charles VII, however he was a bit old for the part.  Charles was born in 1403 and met Joan in 1429 at the tender age of 26.  Malkovich has trouble passing for 46 (his actual age) no less 26.Dustin Hoffman's minor role as the conscience was also quite well done.  Unfortunately, it lost some effectiveness because he was never really put in context.  Was he another of Joan's creations or an actual being?  A little defining dialogue would have helped develop his character better.This is a fine film with a fatal flaw.  If the story is to work, Joan must be a beloved heroine.  In this portrayal, she does not endear herself to the viewer.  Contrarily, she is a disturbing and off-putting character.  For this reason I rated it a 7/10, though it easily qualified as a filmmaking 9 or 10.

Of course, there were the more blatant instances of inaccurate portrayals of Joan's personal history, and they've been addressed thoroughly in some of the other IMDB user views.  I want to also point out the gross oversights in military history.  The battle scenes were terribly mis-represented;  specifically, the quality of some of the weapons and armor, and most particularly, the tactics.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but they did have bows and arrows in the 15th century, right? In fact, weren't the English renowned for the proficiency with the longbow? How many times were bow and arrow featured in the film?  Once, maybe twice? They seemed more interested spotlighting some ridiculous defensive concepts like the bowling-ball-shot-out-of-the-fortress-wall maneuver (it's beyond me how that technique could be effective more than once), and the porcupine crossbow contraption.  Whoever was the technical / historical advisor on this piece deserves to be subjected to one of these kludges.And how can I continue without berating the acting, or lack there of? Milla was HORRIBLE.  Apparently, Besson bargained that if he surrounded his wife with experienced actors, and a high-budget production, that no one would notice her very poor acting skills.  That certainly was not the case. Everything wrong with this movie takes a back seat to the hideously poor performance by Jovovoich.Faye Dunaway, John Malkovich, Dustin Hoffman, and all the rest of the cast failed to rescue this abortion.  I was extremely disappointed in Malkovich's performance especially.  He didn't seem to know how his character should be portrayed.  Of course, the blame for this short-fall has to be shared with the director.I also read in some of the reviews that Dustin Hoffman's performance rescued the film.  Could someone point out where this occurred?  Where was the acting challenge in Hoffman's role?  You pretty much could have given any yahoo with a beard a black cloak and a script and told him, Here, read these lines in a monotone voice.  You would have been left with the same results.It's hard not to compare this atrocity to 1995's Braveheart, so I won't bother trying to avoid it.  Obviously, Braveheart embodied the quality and success that Besson was trying to achieve with the Messenger.  Had he hired Mel Gibson to produce, direct and play the lead roll of Joan of Arc, we would have been treated to a much better picture.In the end, the audience was left with a hollowed out shell of an historical epic, with bad direction, a terrible script, poor acting, gross historical inaccuracies, and gore for it's own sake.

You see it started out years ago as the pet project of director extraordinaire Kathryn Bigelow (Strange Days, Point Break), which she finally got to make, with french money and Luc Besson Producing. Until they were at odds about who should play the lead. Bigelow wanted Claire Danes, Besson wanted his wife Milla Jovovich. So out goes Bigelow, and in steps Besson. Or if you wish out goes the passionate writer-director who had been dreaming of this project for well over ten years, and who would have undoubtedly brought us a truly great movie (she always does that, even with the weakest scripts)But what do we get instead? A senseless and very very bad movie. take Milla Jovovich. Her Joan of Arc looks (the whole film) like she's about to cry (she does it at least once, which was a relief actually) she is just whining and looking at everyone as if to say give me what I want or i'll cry and tell everyone you've raped me or something. But it gets worse. The movie has a tendency to repeat itself after every ten-fifteen minute. We get a battle, battle is won or lost. Joan wants to continue to fight, but the generals don't, Joan whines, next battle and so on. The movei has one saving grace in the form of Dustin Hofman who has a small part near the end, but even that is almost ruined by the stupid reverb effect that sometimes is and sometimes isn't placed on his voice. I suppose it haf a deeper, symbolic meaning, but in the end it destroyed the one saving grace of the film. Still Dustin made me add another point to the score. I gave it 2 instead of 1Oha, and milla?

Far too long and not very good.","Date":"20 February 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Biography, Drama","Review":"  Joan of ArcThere ought to be a compulsory warning for all films that are over the standard two-hour limit. Actually, all directors who are tempted to produce such films ought to be reminded of the letter that started, 'I didn't have time to write a short letter to you, so here is a long one'. Joan of Arc could be vastly improved by heavy cutting - about an hour would be pretty good and an hour and a half better.Though the film does borrow much from George Bernard Shaw's magnificent play 'St. Joan', it doesn't borrow enough. Much of the dialogue is leaden and completely anachronistic - if the film didn't take itself so seriously and was supposed to be Monty Python and the Holy Grail or Men in tights, these jarring anachronisms wouldn't be too bad, as it is, they jar horribly.I thought that things were not looking good in the first few minutes. Not only did we have a potted history of France at the time - al la the opening of 'Star Wars' - but we also had shots of the young Joan carefully called Jean by all the actors running through fields of flowers. First she ran through a field of red poppies, fair enough, I thought, maybe something symbolic about blood to come or something. Then it was a field of yellow flowers, rape maybe, again some possible imagery. Then we had her running through a field of blue Lavender - I began to fear that I had walked into a French version of 'Run, Lola, Run'.It did get better then, it certainly didn't plumb the depths of the ghastly 'Titanic' bore! The battle shots were nicely realistic and gory. Siege engines were shown in use very effectively and the Dauphin was every inch the one portrayed by GBS - if you could describe such a wimp as being 'every inch' of anything!Probably the most tedious of the film was a long series of scenes where Joan chats to a Yank in a hooded cloak with a deep voice who was obviously supposed to be deeply profound and impressive. If a five year old had the patience to sit through all these scenes, then he might have understood a little more about the moral dilemma involved in being against the killing of people, whilst being keen on leading huge armies into battle. It was an insult to anybody else to suggest that such trite moralizing was interesting, useful or informative.The film made it clear that the director was as against the church as he was against the English. This is fair enough, given the subject matter. However, the ham fisted way in which this message was rammed home again and again was enough to make the most hardened anglophobe atheist see something laudable in the English Cardinal getting tired of the hysterical girl. Though a measure of the plot rested on Joan wishing to have a last confession, the reason why the Cardinal couldn't give it to her was never explained - it seemed that it was enough for us to be informed that her ecclesiastical prosecutor was not a nice chap. Clearly we were not supposed to imagine that he had to go through any moral, or other, thought to decide to betray her. This poor exposition was particularly unfortunate given the fine acting that brought the Cardinal to life - it certainly wasn't forgivable on the grounds that there wasn't enough time to make this point clear.So if, one day, a short version of this film comes out, with the tedious and unhelpful stuff removed, it might be worth watching on a wet evening. If I were you, though, I would rather wait until a local Amateur Dramatics Society puts on a production of St. Joan. You will find it a far more uplifting, entertaining and well-balanced experience.

It is the story of a young woman who, believing herself to be a messenger of God, led France to victory over the English in one of the darkest wars that the French have ever fought.  Eventually betrayed by the country she for which she fought so courageously, Joan was sold to the English, tried for heresy and witchcraft and burned at the stake in 1431. Pope Benedict XV declared her a saint in 1920.Jovovich presents Joan as an extremely highly-strung young woman and delivers a performance that is, at best, one-dimensional, denying such factors as age and experience in the character.  It is almost as if she doesn't know which vision of Joan to place in the foreground, a fault which is inherent in the badly developed screenplay by Besson and Andrew Birkin.John Malkovich is even worse as Charles VII, portraying him as a very weak and easily manipulated man - far from the notoriously contemptible monarch that he was.  Faye Dunaway, as the Lady D'Aragon,  stands out in her tiny role, proof of her worth as an accomplished character actress.Dustin Hoffman is by far the most accomplished of the cast in his pivotal appearances as the Conscience that drives Joan to her life as a military hero.  But is he God, Satan, her imagination? That is what provides this film with its depth - it is unfortunate that the rest of the film is directed rather blandly.For in the scenes that penetrate Joan's mind, Besson has layered the film with visually affecting images, creating a tangible atmosphere that is easily able to manipulate viewers' minds.  This is carried through in the violent battle scenes - probably among the most shocking to ever appear on celluloid.  But depth in the dramatic scenes is sorely lacking, resulting in an uneven production, which at 140 minutes is far too indulgent and far too long.The score, however, is impressive and is quite easily the high point of this film. Eric Serra has created music that plays with sound and rhythms in an inventive way, and incorporates more traditional Latin hymns in a manner that supports the action every step of the way.Joan of Arc falls short, basically, because of the mindset of the makers of this film.  Had Besson and company realised that the soul hungers for more than superb battle scenes (which can be seen in a slew of other films like Braveheart anyway) and given us the emotional and dramatic balance that this story can easily provide, this would have been a much better film.

The French make art films,commercial films, action films, adventure films, romantic films, historic films cartoons etc. In 60s-80s years much more films were made, and there were a lot of excellent directors and big stars.  In 90s almost only Luc Besson can direct such commercial films that are successful in other countries in Europe or in North America. He has focused on scenes, dynamic plotdriving but has showed the deep of soul and let the audience think. at the same time (Think about Leon the pro, Grand Blue, Subway). He has directed sci-fi, Fifth Element also of which has not had so many fans as Star Wars has had, but in Europe, in Hungary for example, we liked it. Now he decided to make a film about the darkest part of the French history. Reviewers said that his approaching to the subject is different from the previous ones. Luc Besson directed this film as a commercial filmdirector would have done. He focused on the scenes of apparitions and the war. The life (in her childhood her family were massacred by the British) and religion explains why she wants to ask the expectant king for giving her army, saying she will save the country. This Joan of Arc is self-confident and shy at the same time. She has got not any experience how to lead an army but she knows -she thinks-what God says.  Of course the soldiers will not accept Jeanne D'Arc as general but because of victories she will have more and more influence. But after the deciding battle she is also horrified from the view of a lot of died men, blood, limbs. Even the king betrays her when she is not needed. She will be indecisive, frightened, even she will have to struggle herself conscience. This conscience is a small boy at the beginning of the film then will be a matured, adult man. This is the most interesting and impressed moment of the film. Jeanne D'Arc asks her conscience about her religion, her truth, her responsible. With her the viewer also attains to the total/complete scepticism. But I am sad about this film. I feel insecure of Luc Besson. In his film people speak English not French, which is sometimes fun or strange during the film and big American actors are involved. I heard people in USA hate the subtitles and they don't watch film in foreign language. Maybe Luc Besson made this film for American.  He selected American actors. Dustin Hoffman , Faye Dunaway, Jonn Malkovich who are brilliant in their roles. I particularly impressed by Dustin Hoffman. With his beard he he has got charisma, he is a really alive conscience. But it should have been  worth selecting somebody American actress for role of Joan of Arc who would have been more convincing, because Milla is not convincing for me, and I didn't enjoy the film because of her.  When Jeanne D'Arc (Joan of Arc) should have been determined, self-confident  Milla is not so determined, convincing. She is not charismatic enough for this role . As a Hungarian reviewer said Milla was good as the fifth element but not as Jeanne D'Arc. But it would have been the best if Luc Besson would have remained a hundred per cent French director. This film would have been very good. The scenes, the plot, the approaching to the subject are interesting and understandable and captivate. But the whole movie is not put together somehow. Now it is fashion that the successful directors, actors go to USA because there are money there. They try to make a type of American films and lost their identity. There are very few directors who are able to repeat the same success what they had got before, in the Old World. Maybe Luc Besson will come home to Europe, to France.

For me, the most unbelievable aspect of the film was the differences between how the French and the English were protrayed.Whereas the French were gallant, handsome, humorous and full of honour in battle, the English were protrayed as savages, ugly, stupid, dishonourable rapists with Noblemen (which in the film seems like a contradiction in terms)unable to mutter more than a few words without unleashing a stream of expletives (as opposed to the running joke where a single Frenchman is corrected everytime he uses one of the mildest swearwords available).I left the cinema with a bad taste in my mouth.

In the end of the movie, the audience is challenged to figure out what's the truth behind the visions and voices heard by Joan. Were they from God or from her mind? The movie doesn't answer these questions clearly. That's what makes you think about it. And that's its merit.Regarding the historic side, the movie is correct in what concerns to the main facts. But with one important point. Her sister wasn't raped, a tragedy invented to justify the insane, some times hysteric, and avenger mentality of Joan. This mentality doesn't agree with what is written about her, which is our only source of information about her. The Joan created by Mr. Besson is a fictitious character that maybe expresses his opinion about her or maybe was just created in that way to make us talk about the movie.

I was expecting a very touching and thrilling movie after I saw the amazing trailer. Yes, the movie is very touching and thrilling but it's so, so slow that you almost forget these qualities and instead of enjoying the final scenes, you just want them to end. I enjoyed the beginning of the movie where they explained France's situation making everything clearer for me and for anyone that don't even know who Joan of Arc is (I'm not saying that I don't). Then there's about 1 hour before Joan start to fight. This part is in general good but weird sometimes. Joan's vision were boring and as I was expecting the great visual effects shown in the trailer (the clouds moving, the plants involving her, etc), I though it was disappointing. I was warned that the battle scenes were very violent, disgusting and horrible, showing headless people and body-parts. Yes, it was really violent but I thought the battles were the best part of movie. At the same time I was excited, happy, confused and impressed with Joan commanding a whole army. And Milla Jojovich did one great Joan of Arc, with her fragile face but doing brave acts.Then we can watch Joan's tragic end. That was the worst part of the movie. All the characters are bad now (and I was tired, with bad mood). But in that worst part is the best thing about The Messenger The Conscience! The Conscience is the name given to Dustin Hoffman's character. Interrogating Joan about her visions, the battles, the sword, ..., he make us ask to ourselves was Joan of Arc a saint, crazy or just a girl that though she was a messenger of God? Many people might think that I'm crazy but I loved Jojovich's voice too! Her huskies screams while she was commanding the armies and while she was being judged were amazing.  So, The Messenger can be a bit slow and boring sometimes but it's a good movie.

If however, it was intended as an honest bio-pic of a national hero, venerated and canonised by the Vatican 500 years after her brutal execution, then I'm afraid I'd rather spend the money on a history book, and settle down with a bottle of wine, whilst my more than adequately vivid imagination works wonders making its own mental images.Sometimes you enter a cinema wanting to know more about the historical subject of the film. And, sometimes, perhaps because of the clever direction or writing of the screenplay, you leave knowing less than before, but only because the film raises important social, historical and ethical issues. When I left the cinema, I wanted to demand that someone, somewhere pay for the celluloid atrocity I had been subjected to.  The entire premise of the film seemed to be based on the irritating ramblings of a girl who was hearing voices. Apparently our disturbed Joan decided that these were messages from God, and being particularly  vulnerable to apparitions, illusions, call then what you will, deemed herself God's messenger to the people of France. The battle between the English and French for control of Orleans is the political back drop for the life of simple Joan, who reveals in all her heavenly innocence, after defeating the English in a battle, that bloodshed is not what she wants (whilst standing amidst the slaughtered remains of hundreds of French soldiers).The diplomatic relations between the English and the French are stretched to breaking point, until the Dauphin of France is crowned King - a victory he attributes to the efforts of Joan. However, since war is expensive her usefulness ceases to be obvious and negotiations between these hostile enemies are resumed. Whilst the French masses die of hunger and poverty, ignorant of the callous neglect with which the monarch carries out his duties, Joan waits for more signs from the only authority she recognises. Our imbalanced heroin is determined to fight the good fight and continue on to Paris. With a reckless neglect of her soldiers not dissimilar to her own King, she is forced to face the horrific reality of the situation - that unlike her, politics has no cause. The French monarchy soon starts to get jittery with this religious loose cannon and, although we all more or less know about Joans' eventual demise, I wont' spoil the ending.The most interesting scenes by far are Joan's conversations with her conscience whilst she is awaiting trial (played comically by Dustin Hoffman) which ultimately lead her to question her motives in fighting for her cause. However, the bigger and far more important questions are related to her own mental health. Events in her child hood had indeed left her scarred and undoubtedly result in her fanatical actions but the full extent of her psychoses are never really looked into, apart from the reckless manner in which she lunges into battle.Don't get me wrong, I regard the visual and auditory imagery of Mr. Besson's films as amongst the most powerful and vivid in the film business, especially considering the sheer volume pumped out of the industry. However, this time I believe the imagery was created at the expense of a well-written screenplay, and would have benefited from a more insightful examination of the fragmented and disturbed personality that was Joan, rather than the superficial look at the religious crusader whom we have heard so little about in depth.Try and get hold of a good book that deals with the subject matter in a more entertaining and informative way.Harshad C.

It looks more like a attempt to make a historical epic than a renewal of the style... So many cliches (I expected Charles Ingalls to appear after the first scene when Jeanne as a kid is running through the fields...) that you don't know if Besson is taking his film seriously or not...You actually don't know if he's taking Jeanne d'Arc seriously or not as she appears to be either this messenger of God or a complete lunatic, and wherever the answer is, the result is the same  she's the hell of a hysteric. And Milla Jovovivch is just perfect for crying rivers of tears and shouting around... Disapppointing performance which ruins all the ambiguity of the character... However beautiful she is, she is just not an actress.Supporting cast is good, right, but so mechanical, Malkovich and Hoffman are type-cast and are performing with far to much ease to give intensity and credibility to their parts, they basically look bored. I have great respect for Faye Dunaway who was asked to do a remake of Verna Lisi's tremendous performance as Catherine de Medici in Queen Margot... But even with the same haircut (and a horrible make-up, this blue vein is awfully unrealistic) she doesn't get there... Anyway, I don't blame her for that... It's more the script that mistreats these court intrigues and make them more an easy and fast way (because the bloody film's almost 3 hours long already !) to get Jeanne burnt...Fortunately, a few of the actors have fun here... I'm talking about Tcheky Karyo and Vincent Cassel who really enjoy being in a war movie... But here again, it's looks more like they're purely having fun as actors (not much as being their characters).

But no, Mr Besson is probably afraid that the audience would fall asleep and gives a tedious rythm to his movie thanks to Eric Serra's heavy Carmina Burana-like and ridiculous electronic fantasy noises...

He's feeding us with an awful lot of cliches and instead of renewing a genre, which is obviously his pretention, he's turning it into a rather boring farce in which actors are just doing what they're asked to do because they get so little freedom to actually perform.

My latest conclusion was neither the shooting script and direction were simply not up to her exhibited capabilities while too much of the French soldiery, and what has become the overrated casting of the Delphin, were simply not up to the par she set.   The director's attention seemed hopelessly caught between making the extraordinary story of Jean D'Arc a serious subject, while underestimating Jovovich's overwhelming enthusiasm, and attempting to equal or surpass the court and field intrigues of Braveheart, while also overestimating both the supporting script and its casting both of which lacked the cohesive, and even fundamental, understanding for a treated subject that, in turn, can only yield the ironic nuances, and deliveries, expected of what had obviously been strived for a best of the genre.   The premise of the script itself suffered irrevocably when finally laid bare despite the final, and even straining, performances between Jovovich and Hoffman to save it.   The inconsistencies made inherent, and thus transitions (or better said lack of transitions) from the heartily skeptical and defiant, and, for the most part, unconvincing French soldiery to the sudden declaration of allegiance to Jean by its toughest member, from the ardently Catholic, and even prescient, Jean before her Inquisition to a Protestant, and no longer prescient, Joan during her Inquisition, from the Burgundian Inquisitor who would defy the English for Mother Church by promising confession to nevertheless deny confession -when even, at the end' there was nothing to loose- and, still, from there to, then and only lastly, make subordinant the concept of the confession of possible truth to a priest-confessor to, ultimately, a confession of irrevocable skepticism to, supposedly, only individual conscience or even godhead -the very antithesis of the concept of the sainthood the film's closing would nevertheless celebrate, and which Jean D'Arc was, to the contrary, canonized, all marks the script, and its premise, as subject material which was not only profoundly beyond its authors' capabilities to conceive, but also material which they would, nevertheless, make instrument to, as recent films seem to be making vogue, an evangelism for a modernly self-serving fundamentalism which not only simply did not then exist, but is also so uniquely conflictive, as was the resulting film, as only present-day fundamentalism can only contrive.Though, at times, over compensating for the lack of script, Jovovich, I think, will be remembered best for, nevertheless, not having underestimated herself, while the film's director will be, I'm afraid, at best remembered for having over compensated his film for his having grossly overestimated its having a script -and, perhaps most of all, for having overestimated himself when having accepted it. -John Pastore "},{"Title":"A waste of time and money","Date":"15 January 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Biography, Drama","Review":"  There are so many Jean D'Arc movies and after after I saw Messenger The Story of Joan of Arc I thought that we really didn't need another one.

My disappointment was only aggravated by the fact that I'd been eagerly anticipating this next pairing of Besson & Jovovich, who had created some memorable (if at times a bit too silly) moments in The Fifth Element. The film starts with a bad sign - a long rolling expositional text, apparently filling in with words what Besson (the creator of some of my recent favorite film visuals) could not express in pictures.  And when we first see Milla's Joan (in an understated and confusingly out-of sequence introduction), she is utterly overwhelmed, teary-eyed and whispery as she meets her Dauphin.  She then goes on to remain utterly overwhelmed, teary-eyed and whispery for the rest of the film.  It's as if she followed some bad advice and took her finest moment in The Fifth Element (when she breaks down while learning about War), and turned it into an entire movie's worth of acting.  There are no valleys to her performance, by which we can clearly notice any sudden emotional peaks.  She's just always completely intense and on edge, and it makes for a tiresome viewing experience.  The only parts of the film that I found in any way entertaining were after Tcheky Karyo showed up, and the film could engage in that playful male / female / soldier camaraderie previously shown in G.I. Jane (which coincidentally featured a prominent Joan Of  Arc comparison in its trailers).  Then Karyo suddenly disappears from the film without a word, and with him went any caring I had for any of the characters.  I can't say it was a badly-made film, just a horrid waste of time if you are anticipating a return to the past magic of Besson.

Try not to think of it so much as a Joan of Arc film, but as kind of The Fifth Element or La Femme Nikita with a medieval setting (I know that sounds strange, but it's the best analogy I can think of).  By watching Luc Besson's previous films, I can see why he would be interested in Joan of Arc's story.  I'm surprised (and to an extent, glad) that the people in charge let Besson make this film, I would've though they would want a safer director.Some parts of the film are downright cheesy, like Joan's visions and the use of modern slang, but if you decide not to take it too seriously, you'll enjoy it a lot more.  A lot of the battle scenes have very over-the-top cartoonish quality, almost like something you'd expect from Sam Raimi or someone like that that, and I enjoyed that.  I was a bit worried when I first heard Milla Jovovich was playing the main role, but she does a better job with it than I expected.  John Malkovich struck me as a rather odd choice for the Dauphin of France, who I believe was supposed to be in his 20s.  Watch for Tcheky Karyo from Besson's previous La Femme Nikita in a small role.This film is flawed to be sure, but if you watch it in the right frame of mind, it's a piece of good, cheesy entertainment.  Not as good as Luc Besson's classics of the past, but it will still be of interest to anyone interested his films.  I'll probably get the DVD when it's released.

Along with a recently-aired television mini-series, there are two movies about the legendary French femme fatale.And one of them, The Messenger The Story of Joan of Arc, is out.Action-adventure director Luc Besson (The Fifth Element) takes on the project, with his wife, Milla Jovovich, playing the lead role. And that's just the beginning of the controversy.It seems that in a desperate need to find the `motivation' necessary for Joan to take on English single-handed, Besson conjures up a fictitious scene in which an English soldier skewers Joan's sister with a sword and then rapes her.And so, with one ghastly swoop, Besson finds an easy way out. Rather than tackling straight on one of the most complex and puzzling figures in the history of western civilization, Besson reduces the whole tantalizing and troubling tale into a revenge flick about a comic book character.(Matters aren't helped by the fact that he can't even get Joan's hallucinations right. Rather than having her converse with St. Margaret, St. Catherine, and St. Michael, as she claimed to do back in the 1400s, Besson cuts out the middlemen and has her connected directly to Jesus Christ.)Nonetheless, while Bresson takes some serious shortcuts with the script, he makes no compromises when it comes to the visuals. Essentially two-and-a-half hours of  highly graphic and gory battle scenes, interspersed with surreal visions The Messenger is finely crafted and well-paced, albeit full of medieval mud, blood and dismemberment.While Jovovich may not necessarily have earned the right to play the role, she does an admirable although sometimes over-the-top take on the hyper-energetic Joan. While many of us will dispute her one-on-one relationship with The Big Guy (or is it Gal?), there's no doubt from this movie that she has a God-given talent for breaching drawbridges.In fact, maybe this movie could have been called `A Drawbridge Too Far', for Joan is so overly-ambitious that the very king she's fighting is scared into betraying her. A glass-is-half-full kind of guy, the war-weary Charles VII is happy simply to have his crown and half of France.Unable to give her the army she needs to storm the walls of Paris, Charles VII, like Besson, resorts to the easy answer and allows the enemy to capture Joan. The English, in turn, do their part by finding a way to frame Joan following a somewhat drawn-out an ecclesiastical trial, and she meets her legendary and gruesome demise.Jovovich is backed by some heavyweights. John Malkovich plays Charles VII and Faye Dunaway plays the king's mother-in-law. And in a serious piece of miscasting, Dustin Hoffman plays Joan's conscience so flaccidly that he doesn't even hide the Brooklyn accent.There's no doubt, The Messenger is misguided and rife with flaws. Even as an action-adventure, it barely rises above the splatter. But if you must see this movie, it's worth paying the extra few dollars to see it on the big screen.

But after Jeanne gets arrested, all her experiences and all we have seen up to then, gets shown in a new light. Luc Besson puts everything into a different perspective. And now the question is left open Is she a hero, a divine messenger or just schizophrenic? Well, I think that this film is one of many possibilities to look at something that has really happened (in contrary to the Blair Witch Project, which has caused so many troubled minds lately), but the close circumstances are unknown. We will never know the truth. So, stop complaining, you all (or at least you many), and watch the story the way Luc Besson interpreted it. What you think then is your business.

Unfortunately some movie critics looked down upon this approach, while I found it entertaining. I think some would call this MTV style.But that's not all. The finest aspect of the movie is its objective no-nonsense take on Joan's visions and whether or not she was on a receiving end of a conversation with God. Throughout the movie hints are sprinkled, and you are constantly made to wonder what was really behind the young girl who performed a miracle (or did she even contribute to it?)In this, Milla Jovovich, I think, did great. Her acting may seem like it's over acting at times but I think most of it was very intentional. Considering both the questions raised by the movie, and Jovovich's acting in the climax and ending, it would seem that over acting played its part well.I really enjoyed the movie, and I think others may have enjoyed it more if they went in expecting something a little different. If anything leave the question of her divinity open throughout the movie and things may fall into place more comfortably.

Two interpretations of the same person and events - there's bound to be differences. First of all, I liked the TV version but I felt there was something missing. That Joan was presented more softly - more heavenly. The battle scenes were milder (for TV) and the representations of her visions a little more clearer and spiritual. After seeing Besson's version I see that production as more a fantasylike/romantic representation.I think Besson captured the passionate/fanatical/driven side of Joan of Arc. I think his versions of the visions while they focussed more on Christ and were somewhat confusing, they were probably more accurate to the confusion he felt. The viewer isn't as led by the hand as in the TV release.It took me a while to get into Milla Jovovich as Joan. She seemed one dimensional initially but then as the film moved on her intensity grows and enables her to portray the 'on the fringe of lunacy' behavior of Joan with conviction. Did the soldiers follow her because they believed in her? or because they were afraid? Different from the Leelee Sobieski character because Leelee's Joan seemed more sure, and less intense, less fanatical and less a warrior.Most of the supporting cast in Besson's were convincing. Faye Dunaway gave a good performance as the 'use her then lose her' step mother - quite devious. The scenes with Dustin Hoffman as her conscience were brilliant. She is wrestling with herself trying to understand if what she did and believed were really Gods bidding or her own desire for revenge - Milla really outdoes herself here - locked up in a cage by your lonesome can really do a number on you - you are your own worst judge. This is really where the film leaps to Award winning levels. She wavers on the me or God issue evidenced by her signing the form that says essentially she is a heretic betraying God to save herself (repent to the Church), then renegs realizing what she has done.This film was outstanding. More realistic than the mini-series. The 'Saving Private Ryan' attitude toward the battles removes the romance from the typical portrayals of mediaeval hand to hand fighting. Yes folks a dirty sword when swung with two hands can remove heads, arms and legs. Most of all though Besson leaves you to answer the questions yourself. Was Joan sent by God to have France's 'rightful' head annointed to the throne or was she a bloody lunatic following her misinterpretations of a lucid dream.Would you rather be led by the hand or find your way yourself? 8/10  "}{"Title":"An intelligent, modern assessment of an enduring legend.","Date":"26 November 1999","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Biography, Drama","Review":"  When I was younger, I was entranced by the story of Joan Of Arc There was something captivating in the romantic notion of a girl not out of her teens helping to conclude a century-plus of Medieval conflict with the expulsion of invaders from her native soil.  As an educated adult, however, the whole idea began to seem a bit far-fetched; more of a propaganda tale than a historical fact.  When I heard about Besson's intention of modernizing the tale along the lines of Braveheart, I was all set to be disappointed; the nationalistic fervor that was that movie's strength would come across embarrassingly hollow as the more fanciful elements in Joan's tale accumulated.  To my shock, this film not only failed to disappoint me, it actually exceeded my expectations by actively confronting the issues behind the historical account of her rise and fall.  Despite it's violence and intensity, it actually possesses a subtlety that's bound to be lost on the majority of it's viewers, critics included.Just as it seems the movie is ready to complete the Braveheart mold by following her triumphant rise to glory with a similar indignant reaction to its protagonist's betrayal and resultant martyrdom, it takes a sudden left-turn off the beaten path   After her victory at Orleans-the high point of her career-she experiences another vision like those that lead her to that point, but it is now of a furious Christ, berating her for the destruction she has wrought in his name.  From there, the movie proceeds in a refreshingly analytical manner, becoming an examination of the nature of her religious fervor and its contradictions as the captive Joan is questioned not only by church officials, but by an even worse inquisitor-her own conscience.  Despite this sacrilegious approach, however, the film doesn't overtly question whether she heard the voice of God or not, but how she saw fit to perceive it as a call to arms.Milla Jovavich has been berated as having secured the role of the French heroine based solely on her relationship with Luc Besson; an unfortunate side issue, because she handles the role brilliantly. Neatly framed by Besson's intelligent direction, her portrayal is relentlessly human A diminished Joan that is more cheerleader than warrior, more zealot than saint; all the while a mystifying alien to the people around her.

The fact it was R even disturbed me, considering the story of a religous figure had no need to be that graphic). My first impression of the movie was good, I felt that the girl portraying the young Joan did an excellent job, but the depicting of Jesus disturbed me quite a bit. As the movie went on I started to notice the complete mockery they were making out of this woman, to many people, a religous figure whom they believe strongly in. I was apalled and the interpretations of her actions. Her visions were overdramatized, and they made Joan seem like she was a full- blooded lunatic, compelled by some wordly feeling that drove her to war. The religous facts were completely ignored. And maybe I am just taking this a step too far, but was that Satan that Joan was talking to by the end of the movie? From what they implied I think it was, and I couldn't have been more appalled. Any one who had no idea about the story of Joan of Arc before this movie was probably influenced quite a bit by this depiction of the Saint. Now people belieive that she really was a heretic, a sinner, a crusader for her own purposes, and finally tempted by Satan. Someone just watching this film from the surface would believe that Joan conjured up these visions to her own liking.

I guess I was hoping for another Elizabeth, a period piece with a heroine, based on as much fact as possible.Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but personally I felt Besson and Birken's interpretation was too liberal.  While much is not known about Jean d'Arc, it is preposterous and even blasphemous to think her actions were for her own glory.  She is shown running around with her eyes wide and wild, no senses about her, way over-dramatized.  And she REPEATEDLY says I am only a messenger.  That is obvious from the title.  Once would have been gracious plenty.  The part where she whispers in the Dauphin's ear was quite effective.  But why drag out that persona throughout the entire film?  The battle scenes were clipped so short you couldn't tell who was fighting who (maybe that was the point).  I didn't appreciate Jean being made to look weak and stupid.  There aren't many heroines as role models in this period in history, if any, and to make a mockery of one of the most valiant crusaders is a travesty.Perhaps the film should have started out with her canonization.  There was little said about that, even though it was 500 years later.

They are done so effectively that you feel like you are there screaming with the rest of them as you charge against the enemy.  Part of this is the Director, Luc Besson's magic of vision, but most of it can be attributed to the explosion of emotion that comes from Mila Jovovich, who plays the lead.With these two forces it produces a very emotional film that takes us to a place we have seldom seen in popular movie releases in the past few years.This is the oft told story of Joan of Arc and her life during a very turbulent time and how she led the French to defeating the English when a woman of this time would never have done such a thing.My only one detraction is some of the structure.  Namely the movie races along for 2 hours, then it stops cold.  This is when she has been captured and now faces death, and this is where Dustin Hoffman comes in to the act portraying her Conscience.  I don't have anything wrong with Hoffman's performance, but it is notable that this is when the the whole movie screeches to a halt and that is what I remember feeling at the time.Somehow, since Besson uses many instances of flashbacks through her eyes, I would have been happier perhaps, if he had taken some moments to let Hoffman's character infect her soul in more instances throughout the movie.  I find it a bit hard to believe that this woman who so struggles with her every being and emotion doesn't have her conscience there constantly making her doubt what is driving her in the first place.  Especially since her conscience takes such an active role in the final 30 minutes.That aside, I haven't felt this much intensity rise to the level it does from a character in a movie the way Jovovich's performance has evoked me.  She is so taken in with her character that you find yourself engrossed and going through every feeling she gives off on screen.  It's as if you could feel how much her heart was racing, as her eyes bulge out of their sockets when she screams for support from her army.  Or even when she sprouts tears from being so burdened with all that she is carrying, they seem to flow with no way for her to stop them.

Ms. Jovovich would do much better to take supporting roles in future films while she hones her talent. She is only setting herself up for career disaster by attempting something like this before she is ready.I found that rather than admiring this character for her unwavering faith in God and her own personal strength, I felt sorry for her.  She was portrayed as quite mentally disturbed, not driven by the spirit of God by by madness. I could see no reason in the world why the French armies would follow her--Jovovich was unpersuasive in the role.The pity is that clearly much work and money went into the making of this movie.  The sets, the costumes, everything was clearly done with much care and attention to detail.  I won't go quite so far as to say it was terrible; but do yourself a favor and wait for videotape to get this one.....and rent it on dollar day.

They had the viewer deep into the battle among the soldiers much like Joan herself. This effect gave a feeling of the hysteria of violence that is war. The weak leg of the film, I found, was the script around the battle scences. The dialogue had moments of attempting to be too many things in one film. Sometimes it reminded me of THE THREE MUSKETEERS (1973) where during fights there would be attempts of humorous side bars that just didn't seem to work. Then it would become a surreal moral drama. Some of the language was at time too contemporary and accents varied widely from British to French to Mid-Western American without regard of character. With that said, it really was a very good film of visual messages.Milla Jovovich is very good, also. She conveys an obsessive young girl who has the exuberance of youth and a romantisized inspiration of fighting for God. Jovovich shines in the battle sequences and maintains thoughout Joan's imprisonment. From what I had read in other reviews, I was afraid I wouldn't be able to watch or listen to her, but I found her very likeable in the role. As for the other performances, Miss Dunaway was very good(though I kept thinking of Milady in Three Musketeers) and Malkovich and Hoffman were adequate but not much more. Some of the best performances come from the members of the cast that make up the generals and soldiers who are forced to work with Joan in her mission. These gentlemen give invigorating performances that live up to the battle scenes.The most effecting focus of the film is the cinematography and editing. Sometimes I felt as though I was experiencing one of Joan visions. The picture would appear to float and feel very dreamy in Klimt-like landscapes. The intermingling of her visions and then movements back into reality created a sence of where are we now but then I was never lost in the story. It resumed with a pace of her mission; to save France for God. This film is one of the most visually challenging films I have seen that was beautiful and created movement at the same time(without giving me one of those over-edit headaches like a commercial).I have seen other versions of Joan and THE MESSENGER is as good as most. THE MESSENGER treats a legendary story of Joan as an action packed display of blood and moral confusion and finally lets the viewer conclude about the voices in our head and the destiny that we live.

John Malkovich, Milla Jovovich, Faye Dunaway and Dustin Hoffman were excellent in this movie. I was very impressed with Milla Jovovich's strong portrayal of Joan of Arc. Can you believe this woman does modeling and sings? Let's see Cindy Crawford or Claudia Shiffer do this kind of acting. Even though The Fifth Element wasn't the greatest movie, Milla still gave a credible preformance. She also wasn't bad in He Got Game either. In any case, this movie was different in many ways.  The director (Luc Besson) used many visual dreamscapes to tell the story of how the lord gave Joan a message to visit the soon to be King Charles, form an army and defeat the English. Of course no one believes her until she succeeds in leading the French army through blockades and taking over forts.Yes the movie is a bit confusing. You see visuals of clouds, fields of flowers with Joan running through them, the lord sitting in a stone chair, and other misconceptions of a message coming from the heavens. You really don't understand the whole thing until the end of the movie. Then again, you still may not understand it. The war scenes are very violent and bloody. Lots of decapitations and limbs flying everywhere. This movie is a bit long too. It's about 155 mins., when it should have been about 130 mins. Many of those dream sequences could have been cut shorter and some of the fight scenes could have been cut back. But overall, the movie was decent and worth seeing.

A Gallic-looking Jesus stares from his chair in the woods.  Then he and Joan cavort some more.  Woodstock meets the Thirty Years War.  Didn't she see saints?  I guess Joan isn't Catholic anymore.  Too hard to explain. Joan becomes a woman.  Joan goes to war.  Her captains are likeable cartoon characters.  They disappear midway through the film, and are never mentioned again.  The audience, over their initial horror, can only gape, mute. Joan is tried.  Joan burns.  No one is surprised.  We're just glad that the argumentative Dustin Hoffman character won't nitpick anymore.  The audience hopes he burned up with her. Didn't France--motivated by Joan's sacrifice--unify and kick those pesky English out?  Yes, but Luc Besson apparently didn't find such details worthy of mentioning.  But--mon Dieu!--that burning dummy looked so realistic! The movie ends, abruptly.  Credits roll.  The audience doesn't complain--we're happy to have the lights come up again.  Makes it easier to find the exit. Luc Besson has surely been replaced by a pod person with little talent. Save yourself.  Save seven bucks.

Another problem is the casting. While Mille Jovovich can pass as a boy (Joan in male's clothing) in some scenes, she is still not an actress of the depth needed for this film to really work. She presents Joan's shifting personalities in a set of stock responses ranging from manic to bland, but she never gives us the soul of a girl who was able to make armies follow her and a whole nation believe in her. I also found Dustin Hoffman as her conscience a bit laughable, especially with the New York accent. This would have worked in Ken Smith's satiric comedy DOGMA, but not here in a serious setting. Ian McKellan could have done it, but not Hoffman.At the end, we are left wondering whether Joan, as presented in the film, was just a mad masochist or someone who was genuinely touched by God.

Unfortunately, while she plays it with presence, she also plays it wrong.  Her Joan of Arc is so twitchy that it is almost impossible to believe that anybody would even think she could merit an audience with the Dauphin, much less command an army.The largest problem lies with the storytelling itself.  The first hour and forty-five minutes has gaping holes in the narrative and it is difficult to see how the characters portrayed get from point A to point B.  Once Joan is captured the narrative finally flows smoothly, but the end result feels as though the film was originally at least an hour longer and it was cut in the most artistic manner possible.

It is evident that Besson thrives on portraying this time in France's history to be as accurate and as brutal as historians agree it would have been.  Many of the images are bloody and raw, however; they are never unimaginative.  The symbolism, although at times obvious, is never less than pleasing to the eye.  The photography and composition always carefully constructed as to please even novice audiences. If the film has flaws, it comes mostly from the script.  Co-written by Besson himself, it has strengths while examining Joan, but weakens considerably when dealing with minor characters such as the the Dauphin/King, his mother-in-law, and most importantly Joan's comrades in arms.  This makes the transition from hostile soldiers to devout believers too fast to completely accept. The most intriguing/compelling point in the script comes when Dustin Hoffman's character (termed conscience by many)enters.  Wearing the masks of innocence, divinity, and death, this angel of Joan's own creation does not weaken the film, but rather; does what thought-provoking scenes should- raise more questions than they answer.  Milla puts on a stunning performance if you view her as a young woman teetering on the edge of madness.  If you're looking for a heroine that never bruises and never questions her mission, this may not be the film for you.  Overall a 9 rating from this film-lover.

Joan as a youngster hears voices, which are obviously the voices we can all hear if we really listen. If you don't believe in that statement don't read any further. In her youthful naivete she equates those voices that understandably seem supernatural in the world she lived in and we now live in. When most people cast those voices away, her voices take the forefront in her life through a set of difficult circumstances. To me films like Fight Club and The Thin Red Line deal with exactly the same issue &#150; exactly. Being in touch with these inner `messages' gives her access to truth as best as a human will ever know it. She is inherently a good person just as we all are when we're born. With her worldly belief in the structures and reality that the church represents &#150; she has made an assumption that her voices are truly God's will. Her obvious conviction in her inner `messages' are so convincing and intoxicating to everyone that is in her presence, even her perceived enemies, that `Joan the peasant girl' has the capability to lead an entire army (not that she cares about that status beyond a vehicle for truth). People sense that this person has no hidden agendas or ties with traditional means of gaining power or status or money &#150; she fights for what she believes in &#150; and its overcoming. It's an absolutely beautiful film and a work of art from Luc Besson and his team, not in the spirit of they'll do anything to put a different spin on Joan but to give a genuine perspective that is unique &#150; even without knowing every little detail on Joan of Arc the film speaks truth. They are to be commended. I simply couldn't hold back my tears at certain points of the film. I would like to see this film be embraced by the money giving mass audiences but I'm afraid that won't happen &#150; again not unlike Fight Club or The Thin Red Line. But for me if there were not films like the ones I've mentioned then the world would be a darker lonelier place to live in.

Two things annoyed me about this film first - at two hours and thirty minutes -it is long and you feel it.  Beeson could have cut several scenes (flashbacks, and hallucinations) without compromising his vision , indeed it probably would have given the film a little more balance. Second Joan's lengthy introspective journey to discover herself (the last half-hour of the movie) was too time consuming and esoteric for my tastes.  Finally, there was a Holy Grail feel to some of the battle scenes (they seemed to revel in the amputations and decapitations).  Now for the good.The cinematography is simple and straightforward, and relies on the sweeping landscapes to set the mood.  The feel is further enhanced by the lavish, thundering soundtrack.  The real triumph is the characterization of Joan.Rather than settle for a rehash of the traditional saintly portrayal, the writers opted for a different tack, depicting Joan as a headstrong, reckless warrior not afraid to wallow in blood (until it's too late).  The only reason this gamble pays off is Milla Jovovich (Joan) she delivers an impassioned performance, creating a character that is strong, yet vulnerable, and most importantly, believable.

I can see where Besson was going, delving into the secular and religious dichotomy within the state...however, casting Milla as the messenger representing both faith and conceit, well...goes awry rather quickly. It's difficult to give the character of Joan any credibility when Milla's performance was so lacking...if that was Besson's intent, well, so be it.

We are also shown Jeanne as a real war leader and understand how and why soldiers from both sides either followed or feared her, thinking she may have some magical powers. We also see Milla Jovovitch shouting, shouting and shouting - like the real Jeanne d'Arc.On the other hand, the war between the progressive Burgundy (allied to England's regent) and the Armagnacs (Charles VII's party) is only painted in the background. The fact that you had two popes at the time (one in Avignon, another in Roma) is not told.But the political setting is, overall, correct. So I understand it may be a little bit complicated for an US audience. I really thought that the fact Luc Besson also recreated real battles and the real butchery of a medieval battle, would appeal to a large public (not because the bloodshed is historically correct, but because, let's face it, we like violence).I think the movie should have been targeted at a more mature audience - most US fans of Monsieur Besson will be disappointed.

Besson thrills us with his visuals, plunging his audience right into the heart of the tale &#133; from the tempest of Joan's horrifying visions, to the courts of Charles VII, to the filth and carnage of the horrifying Battle of Orl√©ans.Besson, always one to skirt controversy, takes an uncalculated risk by depicting Joan as the troubled teenager she is, subtly equating her disturbing visions with the trauma of post-pubescent change.  Joan, played brilliantly by Milla Jovovich, roars through extreme emotional states ranging from breathless terror to barbarous passion.  Such profound mood swings may ring with eerie familiarity to those audience members who've dealt with distressed teenagers.Some critics have found fault with this interpretation of St. Joan, but I assert that such a depiction allows audiences to immediately empathize with the Maid's torment.  Too easy would it be to paint a flat, two-dimensional warrior who comes by her skills naturally.  How much more realistic is it to see her struggle with her Divine Calling, even come to hate the voices that compel her into battle.  This embodies Joan with sympathetic traits, and teens especially will identify with her isolation and issues of abandonment.Jovovich's standout performance is complimented by strong dramatic turns from many fine actors John Malkovich as the foppish and self-important Charles VII; Faye Dunaway as Charle's treacherous stepmother, Yolanda D' Aragon, Tch√©ky Karyo (so brilliant as Bob in `La Femme Nikita') as Dunois, a mighty French soldier who comes to trust and rely upon Joan; and the outstanding Dustin Hoffman, in a tour-d√©-force performance, as Joan's surreal Conscience, ominously forcing Joan's hand when she must  confront the reality of her visions.Among the great historical dramas of the 1990s, only a handful standout as masterpieces; `Braveheart,' `Schindler's List,' and `Saving Private Ryan' immediately come to mind.  `The Messenger,' while not as powerful as these films, can easily take its place among their ranks, perhaps the most honest portrayal of St. Joan's life that we have seen.

Despite some beautiful shots (which were the only bright spot of the film), the audience is treated (or should I say mistreated) to some of the absolute worst special effects this side of Baby Geniuses.  While attempting to have the gory effect of Private Ryan or Braveheart, the film's war scenes appeared straight out of a high school student film or the worst Troma production. While the effects were laughable, even more embarrassing was the complete lack of effort in casting.  French and Englishmen sported accents from all over the world, ranging from their native lands to exotic New Jersey.  I could see going all the way and using solely American accents if you're going to do a modern day adaptation like a Romeo & Juliet, but when you are trying to portray history in its native time and place, at least attempt to find actors who will sport the correct accents (or who will at least attempt accents at all).  This glaring hole is representative of the consistently lackadaisical interest in authenticity obvious in the filmmaker's work.  Oh yeah, and the inappropriate scene in which a filthy scumbag rapes a dead woman in front of a little girl was just completely unnecessary.

As directed by Luc Besson (The Professional, La Femme Nikita) the film relates the story of a young girl from her earliest days of life in a peasant village to her final tragedy. This oft told tale was previously told in last year's mini-series (Leelee Sobieski), a 1950's drama with Jean Seberg (Saint Joan) directed by Otto Preminger and a 1948 feature with Ingrid Bergman in the title role. In The Messenger The Story of Joan of Arc, Milla Jovovich struggles admirably, with only partial success, in bringing this iconic figure of history to life. If only Besson had tried to mute some of the histrionics, the balance of fine performances of the rest of the cast would have added to a better whole. Other characters continuously tell Joan to calm down. I believe audience members wanted to shout that to her also. Aside from that, the legend is well told. The epic battle of Orleans is spectacular and gruesome. Heads are lopped off and limbs are dismembered with impunity. Interestingly, though, there is some humor evident in the carnage and it leavens the mix well. Joan's frustration in having so many men killed and yet realizing the necessity for the violence is well demonstrated in a scene where, after the battle a French soldier grabs a horrified English prisoner and is about to kill him for his teeth. The French soldier's teeth are disgustingly rotten. He tells Joan that these are part of the spoils of war. She stops the act and removes a gold ring from her finger and gives it to the Frenchman. Later on in the film, Dustin Hoffman in a brief role as Joan's Conscience, debates with her the pros and cons of her acts and whether her voices and visions were real or just what she wanted to see.Other support roles also make their mark. John Malkovich is Charles VII of France. He is at once, grateful for Joan's intervention, but treacherous when her further campaigns do not suit him or his court. Charles' mother-in-law, Yolande D'Aragon, is portrayed by Faye Dunaway as another self-serving member of the royal house. Other leaders of Joan's army add fine color to the tapestry of this story as it roars to is unavoidable conclusion. The viewer's knowledge of the outcome has to somewhat hurt as the film grinds to a close. The trial is glossed over perfunctorily, and even the final immolation is not given the dramatic power it could have had. The ideal film version of Joan's journey from maid to saint may be in the future. However, until that comes along, this one is not without its merits.

The battle scenes of course (think Saving Private Ryan + Braveheart), but not only that. The key is Milla Jovovitch, who has everything one could expect from Joan, and more. If you can't figure out how a 18-year old peasant maiden could lean men to war, just watch Milla take charge, of her warriors, and of the movie. Mel Gibson's William Wallace was good, but this was another cool Mel character. Here, you've got a hero who's truly frightening, the embodiment of willpower. She's a righteous, religious war machine trapped in a young girl's body, and sometimes a young girl trapped in an armor suit, up to the point of utter craziness. Is Joan a saint ? The movie has an original, modern answer, far from the kiddie legend we all know. Milla's Joan is close to some of Shakespeare's heroes or heroines, mad but not quite, sure of her destiny and assailed by doubts.

Powerful images of Joan's visions, and very intense, yet not overly violent battle scenes are the main themes of the film. Connected trough Joan's messages from God, Besson tells us the major events that led to France's victory over England and to the crowning of King Charles (John Malkovich), and continues with the king's betrayal of Joan, her trial for herecy and her brutal death at the stake. There are times in which you don't know whether you're seeing real life events or one of Joan's visions from God. But it is this special technique that makes this movie different and much more interesting than another re-telling of already well-known history. And it also gives Besson the possibility to create a mystic tension in the calm moments and a gripping tone for the dramatic events. It is also a movie that leads you inside the mind of Joan, and gives you an impression of how incredibly violent and powerful those voices were. You will understand that she had absolutely no choice but to follow the orders she claimed to receive. Forget any performance you saw in the past of any young actress in any movie, (and probably anyone of an older actress too), because Milla Jovovich gives a performance that will stand alone for a very long time. She is able to literally make you feel the pain the voices in her head are causing her, and manages to portray all kinds of feelings and expressions with an intensity unseen before. And with Luc Besson's very special way of putting facial expressions onto the screen (Remember Jean Reno in The Proffessional, when he screams, before he starts his fight against Gary Oldmans police units?), you have a combination that will leave nobody untouched. He demands a tour-de-force performance of all his actors, including John Malkovich, Faye Dunaway and Dustin Hoffman (you may need to read the end credits to realize the reason of his appearance), but Milla outdoes them all. She certainly will be one of the hottest names in Hollywood for complexe performances after this one.The movie plays best in the character scenes, it is the time and place when Besson can bring most of his visions to the screen. The battle scenes are oppulent, but sometimes a little too heroic and idealistic, you might feel a little french loyalty in some of the scenes, but never in a way that threatens the quality of the storytelling. Some in-jokes and a portion of humour make the movie sometimes slightly corny, but it is most needed in the purpose of entertainment, and can easily be accepted.Bottom line Luc Besson continues to make excellent movies with this powerful adaption of a story that was brought to the screen many times before, but never from this point of view. That and the outstanding performance by its lead actress make this another of Besson's films that will never be forgotten.

Jovovic obviously tries to emulate Falconetti's performance and does it successfully in large stretches of the movie, except that Falconetti was more hysteric than Jovovic.The script and the instruction often let Jovovic down, especially in the latter part of a movie that's far too long already, but, for instance, in the scene where she identifies Charles, Falconetti has nothing on Jovovic when it comes to fervent, religious intensity. It certainly sent shivers down this atheist's spine.I suspect a lot of the flak directed at Jovovic stems from the fact that she's a model by trade and therefore should not be cast in roles 'out of her league', but stick to the bimbo-stuff.Another factor, I think, is pure, nationalistic envy. Joan is hands down the most amazing heroine in history and it's galling to a lot of people that she was born speaking French and raised hating the English. So if you're an Anglo, it's hard to take aboard the full Joan experience and taking an intellectual approach is a comfortable way out.

However this incredibly flat and superficial interpretation of Joan of Arc's life is completely emancipatory and forgetful at the very best.

Well, look, it's not brilliant, but is it really the devil that many have painted it as? Not so say I. It's about as subtle as a sledgehammer all told, but Besson's study of the iconic/infamous waif who did indeed expel the British hoards has gusto by the shed load. He nicely crafts the 15th century lands from which to tell his story, and then, to quote someone from another period epic, unleashes hell. Literally. Yep the British armies are stereotypically vile I bet Mel Gibson loves the Brit portrayals here, and the blood that is shed is vicious and borderline sick. But it works well in the context of Jeanne's prominent rise and subsequent fall, with her religious confliction deftly blending in with the blood being shed in the pursuit of liberation. Visually the film is a treat, and for action construction it holds up to be one of the better modern day historical epics in that department. But where's the substance?Ah, there's the big problem with the movie. Besson and his co-writer Andrew Birkin are so pre-occupied with the horrors of war and Jeanne's leadership qualities, they turn the rest of the film into a skeleton in need of flesh. And it's actually Jovovich who suffers the most. She's great when she's screaming and launching into the enemy, taking an arrow hit with grace and dedication . But there's been no character depth laid out, so Jovovich's Jeanne just comes across as a moody teenager out to cause trouble. We need to have some insight into her troubled predicament and what drives her on, not the scantily written filler moments that actually are just appetisers to blood letting battles. There 's also annoyances when the film slips into moments of modern day speak, it's a crass and lazy oversight by the makers to think that we wouldn't notice such speak in 15th Century France. Besson surrounds Jovovich with some fine acting talent tho, even if some are a tad underused.

This movie proves that not only do people use and value their relationships with God and/or religion for many different purposes, some of those purposes can be self-serving, even if we don't realize it. I love how the movie makes the view analyze how religion can be wonderful and sacred and promote change and compassion throughout people; but it can also be used to manipulate, control and conquer. But is this the fault of God? Is it the fault of God if we misread or misunderstand his signs? Should we impose the negative consquences that us mortals burden religion with because we are unenlightened in comparison to a Holy God? What causes people to believe or not believe in God? Do our mistakes from the misuse of religion in God's name give religion a bad name? How can we stop people, or countries from using religion to discriminate against others in hopes of conquoring land or money? This movie provoked all of the questions and many more, making it a new favorite of mine! Lastly, how do we decide if those who kill in God's name are accurately interpreting his will? At what point must we destroy in order to create? More importantly, when do we know it is God's will? What does God think of us killing in his name? Just a few things to think about and I feel this movie showed Joan struggling with all of these questions as well.

Luc Besson has his own original eye for what was thought to have already been done. Jeanne d'Arc always seems to have been shot from a hitherto unexplored perspective. Into this he squashes comedy and melodrama as improbable but sparky bedfellows. Milla Jojovich is perfect for this directorial mania - polystyrene-brained naivete oscillates with shuddering fervour.Around this fascinating (if tomboyish) performance Besson builds a posturing coterie of French military. The nuances of their handling can be easily overlooked; there's a rhythm to how these brutish men sneer, then come onside and move away again. Tch√©ky Karyo's particularly good. I might even have had to admit liking French soldiers were it not for a balancing slew of loud-mouthed English knights.John Malkovich is of course a big draw on the poster, but it's unsubstantiated - Faye Dunaway blows him offscreen.

Evidently, quite a few adherents of Saint Joan found it to be literally heretical. The movie is probably not well suited for family viewing, nor for those who prefer a more sanitized view of French history or Saint Joan.

Here we have an ostensibly French film about a French national heroine, made by a French director and producer and featuring a number of French actors. And made in English. The choice of language was presumably influenced by the need to succeed at the American box-office, a factor which also accounts for the casting of Hollywood luminaries such as Faye Dunaway, Dustin Hoffman and John Malkovich. It also partly accounts for the horrible miscasting in the leading role of a Ukrainian fashion model turned Hollywood starlet, although Milla Jovovich's claim cannot have been harmed by the fact that, at the time the film was made, she also went by the name of Madame Luc Besson.The actual cause for which Joan fought seems remote from modern concerns. The Hundred Years War was not, as we tend to assume today, a clash between rival English and French patriotisms, but rather a power struggle between two rival dynasties, the houses of Valois and Lancaster, neither of whom had right on their side. The Dauphin Charles (who was probably illegitimate) based his claim on the Salic Law, which had been introduced into France by King Philip V in 1316 to justify his usurping the throne which otherwise would have gone to his young niece. As for his nephew and rival Henry VI, he was not even the rightful king of England, being the grandson of another usurper who had overthrown and murdered his predecessor.Joan claimed to have been inspired to fight for Charles by messages from God. Few people today, except perhaps right-wing Catholic French nationalists, would regard this claim, which presupposes a deity with an inordinate interest in the niceties of French succession law, as a literal statement of fact, so succeeding ages have tended to remake Joan in their own image. If this devout Catholic and ardent partisan of the ruling dynasty remains a heroine in modern France, a country which is not only republican but also officially secular, it is because she is seen as an apostle of national liberation avant la lettre. Her story has been used in numerous plays and films to reflect the preoccupations of the periods in which they were written or made. Shakespeare's Henry VI Part I, written at a time of great patriotic fervour shortly after the defeat of the Armada, treats her disrespectfully as an enemy of England. Schiller's Die Jungfrau von Orleans reflects its author's interest in the moral philosophy of Immanuel Kant. Shaw's Saint Joan (filmed by Otto Preminger in 1957) anachronistically makes its heroine a spokeswoman for Protestantism and nationalism. (Shaw seems to have wanted to provoke the Catholic Church, which had canonised Joan shortly before his play was written). Brecht's Marxist version Saint Joan of the Stockyards updates her story to 20th-century Chicago. Jean Anouilh's L'Alouette follows the official line in making Joan an icon of French patriotism, as does Victor Fleming's 1948 film with Ingrid Bergman (made soon after World War II and the liberation of France from Nazi rule). There is even a recent TV sitcom called Joan of Arcadia.Besson's film does not try to impose any particular ideological line on Joan's story, but it does perhaps reflect a modern interest in psychology. This is done by the device of having Hoffman appear as the voice of Joan's conscience, her conversations with him representing her inner thoughts in dramatic form. In one scene Joan sees her older sister raped and murdered by English soldiers. Although there is no historical basis for this, there may be some psychological truth; it is entirely possible that Joan's burning hatred of the English, and her conviction of a Divine mission to fight them, were inspired by her witnessing brutal acts of this sort.There have been a number of French films about Joan, none of which I have seen, but attempts to film her story in English have not been very successful. Fleming's film is stolid and long-winded. Preminger's is slightly better, but did badly at the box office. (Much of the blame for this was placed- in my view unfairly- on the film's young star Jean Seberg). Besson's, however, struck me as being, except in the realism of its battle scenes, as the weakest of the three, and in this case I felt that the blame must lie with its star. Quite frankly, Jovovich does not strike me as being the sort of actress to turn to if one is looking for psychological depth, as her husband clearly was here. One gets little sense from her performance of whether Joan was insane, or a fraud, or genuinely inspired.Whatever the weakness of his claim to the throne, Charles VII (as the Dauphin became) was to prove one of France's most effective monarchs, and is remembered today as Charles the Victorious. One gets little sense of this from the film, but the fault lies less with John Malkovich (who plays him as Charles the Complete Nincompoop) than with the tradition in films and plays on this subject of portraying the Dauphin was a weak, indecisive coward in order to make a contrast with the strong, decisive, courageous Joan. There are some better performances such as Timothy West as the scheming Bishop Cauchon, but none of these lift the film out of the ordinary. Like the 1948 version, it is too long, and ends up as little more than a wearisome historical pageant. 5/10, chiefly for the battle scenes.

This is a film, like 'The Fountain' or 'Jacob's ladder', which, everyone who has seen its entirety, has something different to say about it. How do we depict historical figures anymore? Should it be so constricted as a high school history book? With hardly any identity whatsoever? Besson has definitely crafted quite a piece, in this. If you have previously seen any of the French guy's previous work, you would be able to pinpoint who exactly was behind the scene's, and what makes such cinematography shine. He used Milla Jojovich again, and must have originally appreciated her performance in 'The Fifth element'. This time though, she is not a divine prophesied being, beforehand. But with the tables turned, someone talked about, after their monumental behavior within incidents. You don't exactly know what to think, but have respect for such a person with so much love and drive for France, that they are willing to give up their life for such a piece of land. And accordingly, wound up doing so. It was kind of left with the message, that you never really know what goes on inside a historical figure. Only that, like all of us, there are constantly on a premise in which to work things out within themselves.

Amongst many others, Mel Gibson, the master of fashioning commercial material from rope sandals, bedroom curtains, and a box of mum's make-up, knows this only too well, as must all accomplished, one-time cult-directors such as Luc Besson (Subway, Nikita, Leon). Re-telling the past is a particularly difficult genre to do well, limited as it must be to no more than a legendary use of language, and with little more than myth and tradition to provide a framework. A screenplay, cast and production must be cobbled together with backers' money in the sure knowledge that so many have fallen at this large and testing hurdle. Kenneth Branagh solves the problem by using a time-tested scriptwriter and a weathered, respected team, the only usual nod to inform us 'it's all a game really' is to place Brian Blessed like a cherry on top of the cake. This formula works as often as not, but Besson, at this time fresh from sci-fi comedy, (Fifth Element), is more daring. His cherry is John Malkovitch, and the icing is Dustin Hoffman, during this period of his career more often seen in summer blockbusters and misconceived comedies. France's premier auteur on the commercial, world stage, delivers the Maid of Orleans as Christ. In an approach reminiscent of Scorcese's 'Last Temptation&#133;' the movie asks of the audience not the more conventional questionability of Joan's divine inspiration, but seeks to examine the motives for her claims. Milla Jovovich is short, sharp and punky, glinting even more than her steel armour in the title role. All the character actors are a tad larger than life, and with the superb, subtle, and well-pitched blend of Hoffman's embodiment of conscience and the remarkably effective scenes of Joan's visions, Besson has created a gorgeous film. He chooses to take a story everyone thinks they remember from childhood, gives us a cast generally unknown in the mainstream, and adds a few ingredients to change the flavour. Released in the same period as 'Gladiator', and complete with effects and action arguably as good, this production does have a story. It also has a ring of modern humour, which convinced me that these people really lived. One of Joan's officers, having issued an ultimatum on her (and God's) behalf, is told, 'tell her to f&#133;. off!' This, when asked by Joan for the response, is translated as '&#133;they say they'll think about it!' This is an epic, moving, exciting, believable and enchanting film. The photography is stunning, the soundtrack discreet and of quality. Like most people, I missed this in the cinema, and predictably, recommendation hasn't tempted my friends into watching a 'God-movie' based in 14th Century France, which stars nobody! Dare to be different. This is the message YOU must follow!Docked one point for the lack of Jean Reno in the cast.

Why do we do the things we do? Since it does actually answer this question and resolves this human dilemma - this fact makes it, not necessarily the best film, but nothing less than the most important film of our time, or of all time for that matter. I'm not well read enough on Joan's history to know of its accuracy or not, but who cares, that is not the message of The Messenger. I also don't know anything about the personal life of the writer-director Luc Besson other than he use to be married to Milla Jovovich the star of his film. I don't know how religious or spiritual he is, or even if he completely understands what he has accomplished here, but he must already be a friend of God's or well on his way to understanding or enlightenment or having his moment with God. What he has managed to get on film is only the answer to the age old question - what is the meaning of life ! - and with not one scintilla or trace of preachiness or religiosity - just a search for truth. His Joan wrestles with such important eternal issues till understanding, conviction, and resolution through her God. Everybody believed in Jesus back then, but not every soul had it out with Him or had their moment with Him as we see Joan do in the film. There is such a wide range of opinions evident as to who Dustin Hoffman plays in this movie, from Joan's conscience to the devil. My interpretation is that Dustin played God, with, in this case, the title of, or role of, her Conscience with a capital C. Only the Holy Spirit would have an interest in bringing one to a place, that we see in the film, of conviction, repentance, submission and confession. He shows her (we should all be so lucky - but now with this film, we are) her true motivations of revenge, greed, joy in cruelty, and worst of all pride and she is convicted and says -set me free. How could an all loving God expect any more from His creations, or any less. This movie is a stunning and brilliant depiction of what our Creator wants from us - transactions - and/or a relationship - our being hungry enough for truth and admitting it when we see it about ourselves and about God - in that we are screwed up and only He holds the keys of resolution (and paid the price, on the cross) for our sin dilemma. I haven't seen this relationship so brilliantly portrayed since Robert Duvall in The Apostle - another very important film. How one guy Luc Besson can go from making possibly the worst film I've ever seen The Fifth Element to possibly the best in The Messenger must say something of his artistry, and of his risk-taking. He was born to deliver this message to mankind in this film about an early protestant. Whether he realizes it or not his message through Milla is very Biblical. I doubt he prayed for help and guidance from God to deliver a Biblical message without being preachy, but in spite of himself he has managed to do it, by having his characterization of Joan so diligent in her quest for truth - she bypasses the stupidity, hypocrisy and deception of religion and goes straight to God herself and has her moment of getting real with God. Never before seen in a major release before, that I've seen, or can think of,off hand. This is a must see film for all. I watched the confession scene with Dustin, (who is God) several times with tears in my eyes. Then eventually before she is martyred He Himself gives her the absolution she so desires. Luc probably made a film having his character perform the way he wishes it were so - about bypassing religion for forgiveness and eternal matters etc. but based on what I've read in God's book - I would say Luc has stumbled on the right formula for having peace with God and going into eternity which we will all have to face one day. I wonder if he is well read in the Bible enough to know God has really made it just that simple. If you don't believe me read His book for yourself and see. Admit that He is God and you ain't and ask for what He offers in forgiveness and eternal life etc. - and He will give it to you. It is all such a good deal, I can't figure out why so many choose not to participate in God's program. Milla is perfect for this part and born to play this role with just the right intensity - I just hope and pray she doesn't burn out with all her vices before even reaching 40 - I'm afraid she fancies herself the next Marilyn or Gia etc. - and is bent on self destruction, but I hope she grows up and lives up to all that potential to deliver many other messages from God for us, through her many talents.Run to the video store and see this film at any cost, and then do what Joan demonstrates at the end of the film - have your moment with God and ask for what He offers - it's all free - you just have to lower your pride enough to do this.- chpnlzt at yahoo "}{"Title":"Trying too hard to please everyone","Date":"10 November 2005","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Biography, Drama","Review":" I like a good medieval epic, and I like films in which medieval combat is depicted in a believable fashion. I even like films that are bad enough to be accidentally entertaining. Whether the battle scenes are believable is something I leave to others, but The Messenger is neither of the other two. It is a mishmash of scenes with little, if any, focus. It takes itself far too seriously for the viewer to extract any fun out of it. Above all else, it features a cast vying so hard for an Oscar that it becomes painful. Milla's performances in the Resident Evil films were more appealing than as the seventeen year old rebel leader who forever changed the history of France. Not that I find France a particularly interesting subject in the first place, but France deserves a lot better than this. I must concur with most of the critics in this instance that Hollywood's desire to grind the histories of every country, even America's, into five-minute-noodle-like chunks has grown out of control. You do not expect complete truth in any historical epic, but come on.To those who claim that this is yet another attempt by Hollywood to demonise Christians, I have one word to say suckers. Films that demonise Christians exist solely so you can whine about it. Speaking as an Aspie (a member of a minority group that was slandered to hell and back recently in Law & Order Trial By Jury), your crocodile tears are wasted on me. While Joan's fanaticism is all over the place in this film, the most scarily accurate portrayals are those of the Church figures drafted by both governments to put Joan out of their misery. Anyone who wants a kindergarten version of why the trial by jury system was invented would do well to observe these scenes. Contrary to what some critics might tell you, these instances of verdicts being decided before the trial begins are quite common in societies where Church and State have intermingled. So kudos to Luc Besson for getting that part right.Unfortunately, the rest of the film is an unholy mess. Milla Jojovich is badly miscast as J'eanne, the girl who would lead an army to take back a small plot of land. She is about as French as I am, and there is no effort on the part of makeup artists, dialogue coaches, or even screenwriters, to hide the fact. Although faint tinges of her original Ukranian mode of speech remain, she sounds so American that half the time when she is addressing Richard Ridings' La Hire (one of the few well-cast roles in the film), you half expect her to ask him if he wants fries with that. In spite of having a mere fraction of the screen time, Tch√©ky Karyo and John Malkovich act rings around Jojovich. Put them in a girly suit and give them a sword, I am sure they would make a far better J'eanne. Their dramatic range is far wider, for one thing. Roger Ebert hit the nail on the head when he said that this film labors under the misapprehension that Joan's life is a war story and takes place largely on battlefields.When The Messenger is on the battlefield, it manages to remain interesting for about half of a scene length. The tactics used in one major siege sequence are even amusing. The problem is that when Besson tries to do anything besides an action sequence, it does not work. After the umpteenth shot of Milla acting all bug-eyed for the camera while an array of stupid visual effects surround her, you are just waiting for Joan to be defeated so this mess can finish already. Not content to be incomprehensible while Joan is fighting or developing her reasons to fight, however, Besson insisted in including scenes with Dustin Hoffman where he constantly tells her what an idiot she is, or something along those lines. It always amuses me when people whine about Joan being portrayed as if she is insane. She was a seventeen year old girl who felt so strongly that she had to go to war that it impressed veterans in the French army. That, and statistics, pretty much convince me that she was. Religion had nothing to do with her marching into the hundred years war. No film, no matter how much it crows at me that the Church is awesome (the same Church that burned her at the behest of the government?), is going to convince me otherwise.I gave The Messenger a two out of ten. It is too bad to be good, and not bad enough to be good, either. It is stuck so firmly in No Man's Land it might as well have not been made.

Dustin Hoffman was Hollywood. Yes, Hollywood likes to twist true stories to serve their version of things. They tried to make Joan appear conflicted when in fact there is no evidence to suggest anything of the sort. She stayed true to her faith and died because of the betrayal of the King of France and by the hateful English at the time that saw her as a threat. The deck was stacked against her from the beginning of the trial.There is no evidence that puts Joan in a bad light. In a subsequent and fair trial after her death, the findings were completely different and led to a fair opinion of her that was accepted even in England. And, to this day we do not know what retraction Joan had signed because it was only a few lines and would have taken a half-hour to read when not even given that much time to do so.According to one source, What was read aloud to Joan and was signed by her must have been something quite different, for five witnesses at the rehabilitation trial, including Jean Massieu, the official who had himself read it aloud, declared that it was only a matter of a few lines. Even so, the poor victim did not sign unconditionally, but plainly declared that she only retracted in so far as it was God's will. So the film and those with an axe to grind regarding Joan do not show this immense resolve of this young pious girl.Her canonization in 1920 was quite appropriate.The battle scenes were very well done and the acting superb. But since Hollywood is so Christophobic, they preferred to paint Joan as a deranged religious psychopath. You see, in Hollywood, the rule is that devout Christians must be portrayed as insane, child-molesters, psychopaths, evil, etc. Christians are not allowed to be shown in a positive light. Of course, every other faith does not share that condemnation.So instead of following the public record of Joan's demeanor, they went with some bizarre idea of her as a lunatic.That's how a great opportunity for a film that would have drawn a much larger audience simple by going with the true public record of who Joan was and how she lived her life.

I mean when the french shoot a canonball at the english which says Hello, i start wondering what the writers were on while coming up with this stuff. Having a bunch of lunatics acting as Joan's henchmen doesn't really do justice to the real story about this important character in European history. Milla Jovovich as Joan, i wonder whether Besson typecast her. Because if you've seen her in the Fifth Element, you'll know what i mean. She acts as if she just walked off that set. the dialogue is absolutely horrific. With all the visuals and sets they try to create this 15th century, and they sort of succeed. but whenever the actors speak you know you're back in the present time. The actors use ordinary slang instead of the dialect or even the words used in that time.no good words for this movie. a waste of money!

Now I regret seeing this version of the Joan of Arc story, rather than 'Joan of Arc', the TV-movie from 1999 starring Leelee Sobiesky, or 'La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc' from 1928. The only reason I chose this one was that it was directed by Luc Besson, and that I've enjoyed all of his previous movies.But this movie is a sad chapter i Luc Besson's career. First of all it's boring. Second; the acting is terrible, except for Dustin Hoffman's act. Third; after seeing this film I completely lost the respect I had for Joan of Arc. Milla Jovovich played her character in a way that made me feel that the great heroine of war was nothing but a cocky, sissy peasant-girl with illusions of grandeur. Quite frankly; I don't think that's the way a great heroine should be characterized!After seeing this film on a DVD I sat down to see the HBO documentary residing on the same DVD. Hearing Milla talk about all the research that went into making this movie, that they visited many of the locations Joan actually visited 500 years ago, and seeing original artifacts with Joan's own handwriting and so on, was much more interesting than the movie itself.Hoping to rebuild the respect a heroine like Joan of Arc deserve, I'll later check out both of the films previously mentioned, since I've heard a lot of good things about both those movies. It won't take much to beat this one, but I hope that they're good enough to rebuild the respect deserved as well!

Not only that, but when my children were growing up, in a different place, our church was also St Joan of Arc. So you might say I have a long standing interest in the subject.Before I saw this one, I saw the other recent one, with Leelee Sobieski in the lead role.  Both are wonderful movies, and very different in their approach. I think Milla Jovovich's performance as Joan in this one is truly great. She is, at various times, an innocent peasant trying to follow God's call, and a half-crazed warrior bent of exterminating the British who won't leave her land.Luc Besson directed The Messenger in a more epic style, sometimes going overboard with battle scenes, and 50 ways to kill your enemy. But he also used grand music, great special effects, and one of the best uses of front and rear channel surround sound on the Dolby Digital 5.1 DVD version.  There also is a good dollop of low-frequency bass that tests your subwoofer, and rattles your picture frames.  Without a modern home-theater sound system, this would be a totally different and inferior movie experience.One of the extras on the DVD is a featurette, narrated primarily my Milla Jovovich, which delves into the making of this film.  They did extensive research in France, used some of the translations of the original trial transcript, and used 15th century drawings of events in her life to model the costumes and sets. The result is a very realistic portrayal of the historical events in those two years, 1429 through 1431, when Joan was 17 through 19, and lead the French army against the British to save France.The film makes clever use of a fictional character called the Conscience, played by Dustin Hoffman. He shows up when Joan is in prison awaiting trial. No one else can see him, he is obviously a vision, that she talks to, and expresses her doubts. Some have said this makes the film an atheistic view of Joan. I strongly disagree. To me it brings out more clearly her humanity, her natural doubts about what she really heard from God, and what she may have done on her own. Her asking for confession and forgiveness is a natural response for someone who was so strongly grounded in her Catholic faith.All-in-all, for someone wanting both an entertaining and significant movie experience, The Messenger delivers. It is a bit long, almost 3 hours, but it never gets slow or boring. In addition to Jovovich and Hoffman, John Malkovich is good as the Dauphin who becomes king of France, and Faye Dunnaway as his stepmother. I rate this movie a strong 8 of 10.

I was in hope that many people slowly will understand meaning of Besson's version and in the same way will understand HOW and WHY Besson makes movies. But it's seems so that US mainstream movie making style makes most people blind to other possibilities and visions. YES, it's good to be wealthy and live comfortably, but it's best to be a human being. Why I'm saying this? Because most of you have a imagination of Joan as true, brave, clear-in-mind, good looking 17 years old girl, who saved France. Yes, but it's just a IMAGINATION. No one can know how she actually was. And remember this - it's not Jesus Christ or someone else, who's character and outer appearance is created by our minds, if we honest. She was a real person, real girl with her fears (maybe you will say that she didn't have them at all?), doubts, weaknesses (everyone is weak in some kind) and great skills. Besson simply makes his own version about her, but still let door be open. You don't like it? You maybe even don't like that we can't know these historical persons? That we can't know what really happened that time? It's annoying? Yes it is. But better annoying true than sometimes stupid and sweet lies. And at the end I maybe will repeat myself Besson makes movies about humans, not dolls. His characters - we can cry on them, that they are doing wrong, can suffer with them, feel sad about them, we can do everything, except denying them. P.S. Mostly Besson don't makes movies only for money, that's sure. In US, biggest part of movie industry do. That's sad.

In fact, it was a four-star effort all around, except that......Joan didn't have an older sister, much less one who was murdered by the English, and that matters. Mark Twain said that Joan's was the first, and so far the only, biography made under oath.  Her family roster is not one of the areas the court record leaves blank.  Best guess is that Joan was a saint.  Second best is that she was a total loopster.  If you elect to pursue a third possibility, that she was driven by a traumatic subconscious agenda, then you need a plausible trauma, one that doesn't contravene the record.  Otherwise, you're just getting it wrong. Does this really big error in storytelling judgment wreck the movie? Remember, we're not talking Ivanhoe.  Joan changed the world.

You didn't mishear me, h i s t o r i c a l accuracy. Not that one, which only remembers numbers of dead, years and dates of fights, but something else - which remembers what the human was in middle ages, what was that atmosphere - dark, mysterious, horrifying - in which human had to exist.

I don't judge those people which are saying that Milla was horrible - if that Joan what is in their minds doesn't match with Milla's and Besson's imagination, is their problem. Because six centuries is too much long for true. We can only imagine it how it was when a 17 years old poor peasant girl have all those things in mind. Mostly we can blame Besson because he don't prettify anything. He don't prettify nor makes beautiful those things we are surviving every day - sorrow, pain, hate, despair. Still on other things - music is simply one word - best. I don't know other example where is shown how easy is possible to merge modern, ambient music with classical. Sierra has done it and has done it great. And end title song - 'My heart is calling' - is saying everything what is left to say.

It isn't for the faint hearted, and over here 'Joan' didn't even go on general release, I guess the BBFC were too scared to know what a film of such magnitude would have on joe public.But to be honest, if you aren't horrified by this dazzling, rough-around-the-edges epic, then there really must be something wrong with you.  Likewise, if you see this film epecting to enjoy a 'gore-fest', then you must really have lax morals.  Personally I came out of my seat five minutes after the credits because I could barely stand from the shock. Heck, we all know what happens in the end, no secret - but there's no 'Hollow-Wood' glamour, no 'Braveheart'-type sentimental twaddle.  Death is death I must admit, you have a great imagination.  Or maybe not great enough.  Death is much more simple...I admit the comparisons came into my head, whilst imagining how Besson would handle the ending.  So I cringed when Wallace got stretched, but I had to cover my eyes as Joan's fate befell her.This is an incredible drama, a superb feeling of true-to-life history that is just as surreal as Joan's spectacular visions.  Besson makes the visual atmosphere so intense throughout, encouraged superbly by his and Birkin's nigh-on-faultless script.Jovovich fits neatly within the persona of the Saint, all her reactions and tantrums are so lovingly personal, notably her attempts to stave off the judgements of her own conscience (a role entirely posessed by Hoffman). Also strongly notable were Timothy West as the accuser with compassion and Richard Ridings as the eccentric La Hire,  I just wonder what John Malkovich's dialect coach was teaching him!This is what good films should be about, brilliance isn't associated with happy-endings, nor with box-office sell-outs.

She has a very nice look, as she can look really frail and fierce at the same time. Now, after I've seen it, I can't imagine seeing another actress in the role.Richard Ridings as La Hire is also very good, he and Vincent Cassel (Gilles de Rais) (I think it was him at least) lend the movie some great humour, with Jeanne berating La Hire (a grizzled veteran campaigner) for swearing all the time.Jane Valentine as the young Jeanne is also very good.The movie has some very good (and graphic) battle scenes. They are almost up to Braveheart quality.All this is enough to make a really good movie, but what makes this one a 10/10 is the fact that we are given the choice to decide for ourselves wether we want to believe that her visions were sent from god, satan or if they were merely hallucinations. This is a great touch, as it makes the movie much better for us Atheists. The movie also shows the darker side of religion during the middle-ages (and sadly, today), how religion and the name of god was used to justify horrible wars and torture.

He reassures her to listen to the boy. She runs from the church in and dances through the fields in a laughable Little House on the Prarie meets Sound of Music scenario and stumbles into the boy. She finds a sword and is invinsible against wolves and men on horses that prance by. This sequence is only interesting in the sense that this is the only scene in the movie where you get a sense that Joan's perception of reality is indistinguishable from her visions.The soldiers are from England. They are at war with France. John Malcovich (the future king of France) plays the part very foppishly--with a cute, Tom Cruise look alike always by his side.He hears of this 19 year old who has been foretold to be a savior that must be seen by him. She is summoned to his kingdom. Enter Milla and you expect her to start screeching like she did in the painful The Fifth Element.Never does Besson explore where Joan's obsession with Jesus comes from. Why does an 8 year old girl feel the need to run into a church, drink the blood of Jesus and want to be part of him? No exploration of that or where the visions come from.Now comes the trite exploration of Joan as a woman and a leader. You'd think this would be explored intelligently, but we are greeted with five minutes worth of lines like is she going to wear a dress to battle? before they see how tough she is and they accept her.The rest of the movie is nothing more than uninspired battle scenes where Joan comes across as nothing but a crazed woman. How much more interesting if Besson had actually made her more magical. Her visions of Jesus in the forest--dancing with her, bleeding, and instructing her--aren't as spiritual and overwhelming as they should. They come across as an acid trip from Trainspotting that border on the exploitational.Instead of trully exploring the relationship she has with God contextually, Besson decides to have Milla utter the same lines over and over throughout the movie. I am the messenger, He sent me a message, I've been to counsel, Why aren't you fighting, and listen to me. What a waste. And throughout the movie she just screams and screams and screams.Besson feels that the only way to make the movie interesting at this point is to fill every frame people with big ears, people who look like Lyle Lovitt, people with bad haircuts, people with slanted eyebrows and people with oversized heads stand in the background doing nothing but staring at the camera. No rhyme or reason.People like Dunaway do their best with the relatively worthless part that they are given. She plays Malcovich's mother-in-law and basically gives him meaningless advice while sporting a bizarre greyish vein on her forehead and no hair.The film only gets points when Dustin Hoffman enters the pictures. He plays her vision in the jail cell and he interestingly makes her analyze her life and the meaning of her conversations with Christ. Did you really speak with Jesus or was that you projecting? Nicely done, but eventually his presense becomes laughable--especially seeing him slide into frames. You can't help but picture the dolly he must be riding.In the end your left thinking of Joan as nothing more than a bland, naive woman. I mean, Besson makes the mistake at one point of having her being ignorant that people die in war and shed blood--ridiculous when you consider that she had just won a war the day before. Katheryne Bigelow was to direct this, and even though I'm not a fan, I know she would have done better. A hack job by Luc and an admirable attempt by Milla.

Considering the tale of Joan of Arc itself isn't all that complicated, the movie wandered a whole lot with no apparent idea of where the hell it was going. Worse yet, Besson's solution to the aimless mess was to pile on irrelevant clutter. An opening scene featuring a gratuitous corpse-rape, anyone? Hokey special effects (especially in the damn meadow)? Supposedly French guys with British accents? Melodramatic score? Ugly battle scenes lacking in dynamic? Heavy-handed dialogue?Worst of all in this movie, though, were the casting and acting. Milla Jovovich seemed to think that somehow she could compensate for her inability to convey her character by filling every screen moment with intense gazes and frantic over emotion (which are obviously not the point in a story like this). Dustin Hoffman's role as her conscience was just ludicrous, his delivery rote. John Malkovich's and Faye Dunaway's regal roles were equally baffling; both actors could've been reading off of teleprompters for what the film required of them. I needn't dwell on the vagaries of -The Messenger-'s failure; obviously, Besson was in over his head, because it's an atrocious film from start to finish. I've always been fascinated by the story of Joan of Arc, but not even halfway through it this god-awful thing had me muttering under my breath, Just burn her already.

I was hoping for a little more of Joan of Arc and her life but I guess you can't have it all.We begin with Joan when she is still young, played by Jane Valentine in a very good way. We see how her sister is killed and raped, in that order, and how she finds a sword. She thinks this is one of the signs from God; we get to see some more. Whether they really are signs the movie kind of leaves in the middle with the appearance of something like her conscience (Dustin Hoffman). We see  how she gets her own army, has success, but is captured after Charles VII (John Malkovich) is crowned as the king of France and doesn't really support her anymore. As most people know Joan of Arc was burned alive when she was only 19 years old.Milla Jovovich plays the older Joan. Director Luc Besson also used her for his 'The Fifth Element' and although she is not really bad here she was better in her element in that first movie. Luc Besson was actually the reason I went to see this movie, after his great 'L√©on' and the goofy 'The Fifth Element'. He didn't disappoint me with his direction, but he did with the movie.

None of the characters were developed, and thus you never really got to know or care about any of them.Milla's portrayal of Joan of Arc is completely uninspiring, thanks to the lousy writing, and she pretty much runs around the whole time like a confused chicken with her head cut off.

And due to his inability to affect anything but his own wimpy version of the Southern California  dialect, Dustin Hoffman has no business playing a medieval role. Faye Dunaway is the only one of the major actors whose performance I felt was acceptable.Overall, a potentially good concept is ruined by Besson's lack of understanding that you can't translate 15th century French and English into 20th century colloquial American without throwing believability out the window.

I bet it would have looked amazing at the cinema.I also liked the focus on the inner thoughts and visions of Joan, e.g. when near the end of the movie she is left wondering if it was for God, or for her self she was making the war. The inner struggle within Joan is amazing, the not-knowing-for-sure what she is doing and the I-am-waiting-for-a-sign-now attitude was a pleasant addition to the character's development, and boy was it worth it! Also, concerning the character, I thought it was a great move in the beginning of the movie to delay the appearance of the adult Joan (M.Jovovich). Shades here and there, a black cape on, to cover her by now mysterious face and accentuate the anxiety of the viewer to see what has become of the little girl Joan.Overall, although it hasn't made me weep like Braveheart had, it still holds its ground steady, right below Braveheart, and it would take a hell of a movie to pull this baby down from the 2nd place in epics.

That's just cynical. Firstly, why have a glamourpuss of a Joan of Arc? Sadly, the only known contemporary portrait of St Joan is lost. However, all contemporary accounts describe her as short of stature and plain(ish).As others have pointed out, there is no evidence that any member of her family was killed or raped by marauders.

(The painter of the one lost painting of St Joan mentioned above was a Scot.)Yes, it is certainly true that the French had longbows as well as arblasts and handguns; but why do I get the impression that the film makers couldn't care if the French had longbows or not, and they got this historical point right by accident?I really think that however good the production and the acting may be, this film is an insult to the likes of Vita Sackville-West and to those historians who put extreme efforts to find out what REALLY happened.

Whereas the miniseries gave a very detailed look at the story of Joan of Arc, and took a lot of time to develop the characters, their backgrounds and their motives, this movie is a slow and boring mess.Despite its 2.5 hour plus running time, very little happens. We are shown just a couple of events from Joan's life, and none of the secondary characters are developed at all. The historical context and politics are also kept to a minimum. Instead, the movie spends a lot of time on Joan, and whether she was divinely inspired or just plain crazy. Granted, that's an interesting issues, and it might have worked if Joan had either been played by a good actress, or if the dialogs had been good. Unfortunately,neither of these conditions apply. Milla Jovovich just doesn't have the acting talent to pull of a convincing performance. She makes Joan look like an utterly unsympathetic, crazy and frightened religious fanatic. How somebody like this could have ever inspired anybody is beyond me, you're much more likely to feel sorry for her.The dialog and the supporting cast don't help either. Dustin Hoffman does a fine job, but John Malkovich is totally wasted here, and the other actors are generally very unconvincing. The dialog is horrible as well the parts that are intended seriously are so heavy-handed and clich√© that they become unintentionally funny, whereas there are also some light-hearted parts that feel totally inappropriate.Given the directory's experience with action movies, it's surprising that he doesn't even get the action sequences right. The action is fairly gory, but it lacks any kind of tension or coherence, and is often fairly silly, to the point where the characters start vivid discussions in the middle of the battle, standing with their backs towards the enemy. Right.The Messenger is a completely wasted attempt at telling the story of one of the most fascinating women in history. The story, intrigue and secondary characters are dumbed down to a point that is almost becomes silly, the pace is dreadfully slow, the action is dull, the dialog and acting are very unconvincing, and Milla Jovovich completely fails to make an interesting or even likable character out of Joan.*1/2 out of ***** "}{"Title":"WHAT?

OK, maybe I don't know that much about the real Jeanne d'Arc (director Luc Besson should know it better than me) but I was never aware that she was a raving lunatic who savored the taste of blood, breathed in heavy gusts, and couldn't say a complete sentence without pausing for dramatic effect.  It's true, most foreign directors are great visionaries but when they are working with actors that don't speak the same language as them, something gets emotionally lost in the translation.That doesn't apply to the battle scenes though.  After all, this is the director who gave us The Fifth Element and (more importantly) The Professional.  I can't say too much about them, however, I refuse to give away any of the shocks involved.This film was missing two things 1) Jean Reno, Luc Besson's ever-present actor/sidekick (their relationship mirrors that of John Woo and Chow Yun-Fat), and 2) Gary Oldman.  OK, I liked John Malkovich's performance as the Duphine of France but he seemed too 90s.  In fact there were a few comic moments in this film that were so modern that I almost was expecting Adam Sandler to walk in as Opera Man and have him sing an announcement to the King of France.That leaves Dustin Hoffman for last...which is exactly what he is...last.

Honestly he doesn't arrive until 120 minutes into this 155 minute film (much like Brando in Apocalypse Now) and then he relegated to hiding under a hood and beard to urge Joan back to reality just in time for her imminent execution.  What a nice guy.I have a suggestion for great foreign directors who want to make American films  either hire another director like Scorcese or Coppola who KNOWS how to pull a performance out of an actor and stick to doing the action scenes and designing the look of the film OR hire actors that are so good they don't NEED direction.

You get a giant mess is what. The Messenger The Story of Joan of Arc is loaded with lots of talented people, is filmed gorgeously and is mostly a lousy, muddled film.The story of Joan of Arc (or Jeanne d'Arc as they call her in France) is well known just about everywhere. Joan is a poor peasant living in a small village in France during the Hundred Years War with England. She begins seeing heavenly visions that tell her she is God's messenger to rid her country of the bloody English. Somehow she convinces Charles, the Dauphin with visions of being king, to give her an army to storm Orleans. Using unconventional methods she leads her army to victory. The Dauphin is crowned king and mostly forgets about Joan. She leads an unsuccessful siege on Paris is given over to the English, tried and burned at the stake, several hundred years later she is sainted by the Catholic church. The Messenger covers most of this relatively faithfully, and beautifully.Luc Besson is a talented director filming such classics as Le Femme Nikita and The Professional. His talent is presented here in his ability to create interesting and beautiful shots, but is lost in creating a cohesive story. He doesn't seem to know what to do with the story about the young saint. In parts it seems earnest in it's recreation of this revolutionary with heavenly visions, but then it sinks into near parody of itself and in the ends sinks towards a reinventing of the events themselves asking Joan herself whether or not her visions were real or mere psychosis.Milla Jovovich is a pretty face who has mostly been in forgettable, silly comedies and the Resident Evil franchise which might as well be considered a silly comedy for all its worth. Here, she has two modes of acting, a strange amphetamine delivery of her lines as if she couldn't spit them out fast enough, or a snarled scream as if acting was merely being the loudest person on the set. It is not a nuanced performance. For the entirety of the film she seems completely out of place.The battle or Orleans is tame at best. There are virtually no scenes of real ambitious spectacle. We are given nothing to inform us of her revolutionary forms of combat. Instead her method seems to be screaming a lot and jumping a horse over the enemies fence. Later the storming of Paris is so humorous it is sad. Joan screams and screams that she needs back up while a few soldiers randomly knock on what must be the Paris gates. These soldiers are so bewildered a pathetic looking they seem more out of a Monty Python sketch than a serious film about war.Beyond the visual elements the only saving grace is Dustin Hoffman's performance as the Grand Inquisitor or Conscience. It is a fine performance from a fine actor, but it is a peculiar character. He spends his time questioning Joan's own sanity. Could her visions in fact be some form of psychosis or fantasy? Could crucial moments in her life like finding a sword in a field in fact be simple coincidence? Good questions in the history of the real Joan of Arc, but they seem out of place here. Nowhere in the film are we led to believe Joan is nothing but the real thing. Why bring these questions into play during its climactic ending. The film would have worked much better believing whole heartedly in Joan's purpose and vision. Or questioning her visions from the beginning, a re-visioning of the myth could be very interesting. Instead it kicks its legs out from under itself by bringing her into question so late in the film.What we get in this portrayal of Joan of Arc is some pretty visuals and a find performance from Dustin Hoffman. Try renting one of Luc Besson's earlier films and pick up anything from Hoffman's hey day in the 70's, they will be worth your dollar and your time far more than anything thing to be found here.

But what can I say, other than that people don't recognize garbage no matter how far down their throats it is shoved?For this movie to receive any praise at all is ludicrous in itself.  Certainly, it could be an interesting prospect to examine the life of a supposedly-schizophrenic national figure with more negative connotations than positive, but how far is it necessary to go to portray Besson's notion that Jeanne d'Arc may not have been as holy as she has been said to be?  How necessary is it to continually emphasize total pharisaism as opposed to mere pride?  How necessary is it to portray Jeanne's visions as downright satanic, and dispense of the saints which had supposedly spoken to her?  And how necessary is it to portray her as a raving psychopath?If one is going to argue for historical accuracy, then perhaps they should keep something in mind simply because somebody engages in a battle which in actuality took place, it does not make for accuracy;  the same goes for an individual performing a certain action, or any other occurring event.  In fact, this movie appears to guise itself under historical accuracy, while it fails to explain any of the events that are taking place at the time.  Yes, we know that France is divided and that the English are attempting to take over, but are we ever introduced to any of the political intricacies or other matters that Jeanne partook in other than those on the battle field?  Anybody with an ounce of intelligence would know that Jeanne d'Arc's story is not one of war.In addition, there is lewd and tasteless humor interspersed throughout the entirety of this movie.  Obviously, it was not enough to view the life of Jeanne d'Arc through the eyes of a cynic, but through the eyes of a perverse, teenage-minded director as well.  If you're looking for a modern film on Joan of Arc, do yourself a favor and take a look at the TV movie starring Leelee Sobieski.

Based on the available factual circumstances of the Maid of Orleans and the different opinions of those who knew the demented visionary, egocentric, stubborn, lesbian, heretical and saintly heroine-witch, Ms. Milla Jovovich did a splendid interpretation of such a complex individual who, after all, was also a human being living under a much different socio/political and religious environment that we are lucky to have not experienced.I find that of the many biographical, theatrical and cinematic treatments of Jeanne D'Arc The Messenger this is most enjoyable due to its modern language and casting. Ms.Dunaway, Mr. Hoffman and Mr. Malchovich were a delight to watch.Needless to say, I enjoyed this film because the universal human elements of exuberant youth, fear, doubt, faith and love are explored as well as the ugly realities of revenge, arrogance, hate, prejudice and religious righteousness/betrayal (denial of the Sacrament of Penance?...go figure), ridicule and egocentricity in an unbiased and well defined manner.

More biographies of Jeanne d'Arc exist than of any other person, and any attempt to portray her rather incredible life as France's greatest heroine and martyr on film can expect to encounter a similarly large number of second-guessers. This is precisely what happened when this picture came out. Reviewers went on at length about what the picture should have been about, and how Joan should have been portrayed (and by whom), leaving readers to wonder what they thought of the picture that HAD been made. This tendency to review the picture they wish had been made is a classic failing in many critics and this picture seemed to bring it out especially often.The picture that Luc Besson made here deserves to be appreciated on its own merits. It is visually stunning, rousingly action-packed, and full of interesting period details. Yes, casting his supermodel wife Milla Jovovich in the lead was a risky choice, as her looks were hardly those of a typical medieval peasant. Yes, her performance did not resonate with the period the way one by a more classically trained actress might, although she was clearly never trying to be Ingrid Bergman. Still, Milla's hyperactive personality made her interesting and watchable as a historical person about whom so much has been written, who nonetheless existed so far back in the past that she lacks a strongly identifiable humanity. When somebody makes a better statue than a person, as Joan does from a contemporary viewpoint, odd casting choices can be forgiven if they work. Milla's twisty mannerisms, rolling eyes and whispery speech give the viewer constant occasions to ponder just how much of Joan's fanaticism came from genuine devotion to God and the church and how much was just an under-medicated personality disorder. This is actually one of the key scholarly issues surrounding Joan's life, and the picture brings it to the fore in its latter part as Joan herself tries to come to terms with her own claims of divine communication by means of a debate with Dustin Hoffman as her confessor-priest/conscience. That Besson takes no particular viewpoint here is an interesting choice, and one which actually helps the viewer to understand why Joan's story has compelled so many generations of historians.The political aspects of Joan's life and legend were also dealt with in a nicely balanced fashion. Like many figures in times when political and national alliances changed with the seasons, Joan herself blew back and forth between being tremendously useful to the French throne at times and dangerously inconvenient at others. Fame is a powerful commodity at any time, and the picture carefully tracked the rise and fall of Joan's fortunes as she watched hers be manipulated, leveraged and ultimately put on trial.I thought a lot of The Messenger and recommend it. Religious and historical scholars are advised to approach with caution.

As in, Oh sure the star is the directors wife. That would be true if Luc Besson was anything less than a great director or Mila Jojovich anything less than a great actress. This film accomplished a lot. Visually spectacular, historically challenging, and in many ways ingenious. Most of all, it didn't fall prey to the unconditional hero worship or unquestioning belief that most films about moving historical figures do. The film maintains it's historical modesty, questioning rather than preaching or glorifying. If you are looking for a moving, spiritual, emotional movie it's got all that. If you are looking for medieval warfare in all it's glory, it's got all that.But sadly it is flawed. Much to my chagrin, as I do admire most of his work, Dustin Hoffman's performance is, to put it mildly, a big downer for the film. He is clearly at a loss as to what his character or purpose is in the film. His performance is uncomfortable and distracting. Despite his lower appearance in the credits, his role was critical in the film. It's a real detractor. But aside from this one glaring flaw, the film is of the highest quality on all accounts. I was riveted from beginning to end and wouldn't hesitate to watch it again. Because of it's one casting/directing flaw I have to rate it an 8 but on every other count it's a 10.

As might be expected from a Besson film, it looked incredible. The battle scenes were all well-handled, and as the warrior Joan, Jovovich was quite convincing. The rest of the movie was something else again.It seems to me Besson and his co-writer, Andrew Birkin, were trying to do what Kenneth Branagh did in his version of HAMLET; look at the lead character not as an icon, but as a normal human being, and try to explain their actions and behavior in that context. Admittedly, since I am unfamiliar with this story, I am more receptive to this approach than those who hold Joan as an icon, but I would have been more than willing to watch a movie which handled this material well. Unfortunately, once Besson established which way he wanted to go, he seemed unsure of how to get there. Most of the drama is handled on a third-grade level(especially her trial), and we never really get into what made Joan tick. Though the scenes with Dustin Hoffman were involving, especially since he was so good, they too fell short in explaining Joan. And Jovovich can't quite access those depths yet.The rest of the cast is okay. Malkovich and Faye Dunaway are playing types, but they play them well enough. Tchecky Kayro(I know I'm not spelling that right) and Vincent Cassel lend a sense of gravity to their roles as soldiers. But all in all, this is a movie whose reach was beyond its grasp.

However, even applying 'artistic license',... I was overwhelmed to see how close Luc and Andrew Birkin came to writing a script providing us with a moving and compelling record of events,... and how they managed to orientate Milla Jovovich to providing such a 'realistic' portrayal of the times, emotions, unswerving drive and FAITH surrounding the enigmatic and legendary character of Jean D'Arc,&#x85; I almost followed her into the battles and confrontations with the Church !!!The screenplay was almost exactly as has been described in the book The Mystery of Joan of Arc written by the Frenchman, LEON DENIS. Translated into English by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,(1924) and in which the following message from Jean D'Arc is givenSweet is the communion with those who love our Lord and Father even as I do. I am not saddened by the vision of the past, for it draws me to you, and my remembrance of my communion with the holy dead makes me the sister and the comrade of all those to whom God has granted the favour of knowing the secret of life and death. I return thanks to God for permitting me to draw close to you, and to tell who know a little that the lives which God gives us must be used wisely if we are to be in His grace. All life should be sweet and welcome which enables us to do the task assigned to us by the All-powerful Father and Judge. We should bless all that comes from His hand. He has always chosen the weak to carry out His plans, for He can give strength to the lamb, even as He promised. He brings truth under the most changing forms, but all cannot understand His purpose. Submissive to His laws and trying to follow them, I have not always understood them. I knew, however, that the sweet counsels which He gave me could not be the work of an enemy, and the comfort which they have always given me has been a stay in trouble and a heart's joy. I never knew what was the deeper design of the Lord. He hid from me in all His messages the dreadful end which I was to endure, having pity on my weakness and on my shrinking from pain, but when the time did come, He gave me strength and courage. I love to think of the hours when first I heard the voices. I cannot say that I was afraid. I was greatly astonished to find myself the subject of the Divine Mercy. I knew instantly that they were the messengers of God, and I felt a great sweetness in my heart whilst the holy voice rang in my ears. It is not possible for me to tell you exactly how I felt, for I could not describe the deep peace and joy, so that when they ceased I felt that I was the child of God and of Heaven. I feebly comprehended that their will should be mine, but though overjoyed at their coming, I was surprised at the orders they gave and feared a little to execute them. It did certainly seem a fine work to save our France, but how was a girl to go among men-at-arms? Finally, in their sweet and constant companionship I came to have more confidence in myself, and the love which I had ever had for God guided my conduct, for it cannot be right to rebel against the will of a Father. It was a hard task, and yet I had joy in obeying, and I set forth to do the Will of God. I am happy that I followed His orders, and I pardon those who were the instruments of my death, for I know that it was not out of hatred for my spirit that they set it free, but because they hated the work that I had done. This work had been blessed by God, and, therefore, they were deeply in the wrong, but, like them, I have no hatred for their spirits. I am only the enemy of all that God condemns, or falseness and wickedness. It is their work which is evil. They return to it ever, but the remembrance of their past cannot be effaced by them. I mourn for the hatreds which they have encouraged among those who should be brothers, and for the evil weeds which they have sown in the Church, which have caused this Mother whom I once cherished to devote herself rather to theology than to charity. It is pleasing to me to see that they improve and admit to some extent their error, but things have never been as I should have wished them, and my love for the Church turns more and more away from this ancient guide of souls in order to give itself more completely to our sweet and gracious Lord.

Instead of pigeon-holing us into his version of the truth, Luc instead asks more questions than he answers, and then leaves the viewer to ponder them.

Her supporting cast is just as solid, with Faye Dunaway, John Malkovich, Dustin Hoffman, and Tcheky Karyo just to name a few. The cast here is used to create an army of good, bad, and mostly in between characters. Even the clergy is portrayed without overtly vilifying them. The script was solid, the direction great.

As the title may suggest, this movie is all about Jeanne D'Arc, the peasant girl who would later claim to have seen visions from God and lead the armies of France to several triumphs over the English during the Hundred Years War.The film is impressive. Even if it is not perfectly accurate in a historical sense, it does outline the highlights of Joan's campaign, the prominent figures who fought with and against her, and works wonders in capturing the sheer brutality of battle.Milla Jovovich (RESIDENT EVIL, THE FIFTH ELEMENT) is wonderful as the violent, aggressive, and zealous titular character, with her hatred for the English and desire to do God's will made plain on every shot of her face in battle.Strong supporting turns from John Malkovich (BURN AFTER READING, BEING JOHN MALKOVICH), Dustin Hoffman (SLEEPERS, RAIN MAN), Tch√©ky Karyo (THE PATRIOT, GOLDENEYE), and Vincent Cassel (EASTERN PROMISES, OCEAN'S TWELVE) round out the film's acting retinue.The battle sequences are brilliantly and brutally shot, specifically designed to do away with the glorification of war that is so frequently seen in movies such as this; men are decapitated, blood sprays, heads are smashed to a pulp. The savagery of 15th-century warfare is brought to the fore effectively and honestly.But the post-capture sequences are equally entertaining, and this is largely because of Dustin Hoffman's spectacular turn as 'the Conscience'. In many ways, Hoffman carries the second act of THE MESSENGER, and his rendering should have been Oscar-worthy.About the only place the film really suffers is in small areas of scripting. There are times when characters say silly, or outright stupid, lines. This is especially true in the moments leading in to battle.All in all, the movie was entertaining, and worth buying for anyone who wants to expand their library.7/10.

One must wonder what was on the mind of the people that were involved in the direction of this film. I don't know the history of Joan Of Ark, but I didn't like the way they portrayed this character. It was very dark and disheartening as if there was treachery behind every corner throughout the movie. I don't really think it helps the story nor what the character represented to cast so much doubt on her actions. It would have been better to come at the story from one angle. then to come at it from all angels and confuse the audience as to what her intentions really were. It seemed more like the story tellers are trying to persuade the audience that people who believe in signs or a higher power are less significant then people who primarily use their intellect to make choices in life. From my experience the mind is only a tool to be used when the need arises, but I don't think its a complete substitute for relying on internal intuition. It up to everyone to decide for themselves if their own intuition is an inherent property of being human or part of something larger.That being said I think the films battle scenes and acting were well done. I'm sure allot of work went into it and I do appreciate the time it took to make a film of this scale.

Quite frankly, I thought it was brilliant.For a start, I thought Milla Jovovich's performance was simply amazing. While she may have been wasted with things like Resident Evil Apocalypse of late, she really is a superb actress when given the right script. I thought she actually showed a great deal of potential in The Fifth Element, despite the genre of that film limiting the chances to show any real acting ability.Not so here. As well as getting to kick ass in her normal manner, she also turns in a great dramatic performance, and really makes you feel the emotions her character is going through. She has a wonderful vulnerable quality (which was demonstrated admirably in The Fifth Element)... Winona Ryder is about the only other actress I can think of with the same talent in this regard.There's also an extremely able supporting cast. Despite having an accent that's completely out of place, John Malkovich is great as Charles. Vincent Cassell also turns in a good performance in a role which could have been merely comic relief, but one which he drags to a level above that (although he looks distractingly like Matthew Lillard at times). Faye Dunaway does well with a character who doesn't exactly exude personality, while Dustin Hoffman... well, Dustin Hoffman is there.I also thought the look of the film was fantastic. The realism of the battle scenes is impressive, and Luc Besson's direction really brings them to life. No punches are pulled and we see people decapitated, amputated and maimed all round... and hey, who doesn't enjoy a good decapitation now and then? I also thought the costumes were great, especially those of Faye Dunaway's character. The costumes of the extras and minor characters also look fantastic, and it adds an extra level of realism to the look of the film.As for the story... well, I find it hard to comment. I'll admit that I'm pretty ignorant of the real tale of Joan of Arc, so I have no idea how closely this adaptation sticks to it. What I will say is that I found the story the film presents engrossing, and despite the fact I had originally planned to watch only an hour of the film before switching over, it hooked me, and kept me hooked until the very end.I did feel the film had one weakness however -- nothing about Joan is ever really explained. We never find out if her visions were really a message from God, or merely a product of her own imagination. Her mental state and ability are well represented during the film (especially with Jovovich's great performance), but there are no clear answers about her character. I guess this is designed to let the audience believe whatever they want to, but I'd have preferred a more committed stance from the film itself as to the how and why of Joan of Arc.I'd never even heard of this film prior to seeing it. It was simply something I started watching to pass the time while waiting for something else to start, but I'm glad I chose to watch it. I think it's a strong contender for a place on my top twenty list.Highly recommended.

So, if you sit in front of your TV and assume that Joan of Arc has never existed and is Luc Besson's own fruit of imagination, this might not be an exceptionally disgusting experience.

The issue most people have with this film is its interpretation of who Joan of Arc was.  True, Joan is a saint.  But hundreds of years before she was a saint, she was a human being!  She cried, she made mistakes, she was susceptible to fear and pride. If this movie turned Joan into an atheist or something, I could understand people having a problem with it.  But in my opinion, this movie makes the story even more moving!  What does it matter if Joan was crazy or truly a prophet?  She returned the throne to Charles VII, didn't she?  And as for the time she was in prison...I believe that the addition of the Conscience made for a haunting, provocative film.  The film wouldn't be nearly as powerful if it wasn't for Joan's doubts.  Her conversations with the Conscience are, in my opinion, some of the most powerful dialogue of any movie.  The Conscience didn't rob her of her belief or of her triumph.  He made her see -- truly see, not just say -- that she was merely a messenger, not divine.  She acknowledged her faults, but despite that, she went to the stake still firm in her faith.  I don't pretend to know if Joan was truly a prophet, or just a strong believer, but her portrayal in this film took nothing away from her as a historical being.  All it did was change it. According to Besson's film, Joan truly believed in what she fought for, and that's what's important.  The fact that she is shown as fallible only makes her story that much more compelling.I had seen Milla in The Fifth Element, and her acting was all right, but nothing that memorable.  However, after seeing The Messenger for the first time, I was haunted by the memory of her portrayal of Joan for days afterward.  I still get chills when I remember certain scenes.  In my opinion, she was truly brilliant as Joan.  The passion and emotion that made up who Joan was is portrayed perfectly by Milla.  I am completely serious when I say that her acting left me speechless.The other actors did well, especially Faye Dunaway as Yolande.  She was the perfect cool and calculating mother-in-law of the king.  John Malkovich was also good, in a portrayal of Charles VII not as a selfish monarch who sacrificed Joan the first chance he got, but as an impressionable, immature king who was too easily swayed by the advice he got.The movie does have its flaws -- the war scenes seem more geared towards shock value than historical accuracy or plot movement.  It's true that there were little annoying things, like the inconsistency of Joan's hair color, but these were far overshadowed by the story and Milla's inspired acting.This movie is, without a doubt, one of my favorite movies.  It has changed the way I think about many things, and I wish I could thank Luc Besson for creating this film, and Milla Jovovich for giving us a Joan unlike any before.  P.S.  If anyone would like to contact me in regards to my comments, please feel free.  I would love to get feedback. "},{"Title":"Ambiguous?  I don't think so.","Date":"1 October 2000","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Biography, Drama","Review":"  I've noticed a lot of comments saying this film is ambiguous in it's treatment of the subject of faith.  I have to disagree.  This movie is as aethist as they come.  (Spoilers ahead.)  When Joan confesses to 'the conscience' at the end of the film, it is clear that the intent is to discredit her belief.  She caves in to the 'realist' view of her deeds as presented by Hoffman's character, and as a result, what this film says is that Joan of Arc was a crazy woman who managed to eek out a victory against the English at Orleans.The film does explore the contradictions which the legend of Joan of Arc presents.  How do you reconcile both sides of a woman who is at once a saint and a warrior?  Her role seems to be a contradiction in terms, and this is something that the film does portray.  But in the end, the film does not leave any doubt as to whether Joan was truly a visionary or a madwoman.Another problem with the movie is the fact that Joan seems to be the *only* one who believes in God.  I think what a lot of producers of historicals tend to forget is that back then, people believed with a capital B.  They believed in God, they believed in witchcraft, and in signs and portents. Nobody seems to have as strong a faith in God as Joan does.  Everyone around her seems to be very pragmatic or hypocritical about their beliefs, and I think this is inaccurate.  This seems to be a case of the filmmaker 'modernizing' the characters in order to make them more suitable to his audience.  Granted, it would be harder for a modern audience to accept the idea that, gee, wow..everyone really *really* believed in God back then, but it would be a much more accurate portrayal of the times.All in all, a pretty disappointing film, because the director's interpretation became more important than the story itself.

Instead of being portrayed as the powerful and inspirational figure that she was, Joan D'Arc comes across as an insipid dumb blonde, and a looney.  For most of the movie she alternates between seeming like a frightened rabbit (as somebody else commented) and a plain air-head.  Not really the type of character you would expect to inspire the might of France, and strike fear into the English.The Messenger gets off to a very poor start. Despite being based on real historic events it seemed completely contrived and unbelievable to the point of being stupid.  A lot of this comes down to the choice of actresses to play Joan.  Despite not seeing 5th Element, I'm told her non-talking part was fine.  But in choosing his wife to play a role that required serious acting Luc Besson has doomed this movie to a very quick demise.  Beyond the acting, much of the problem may have been the script and direction.  Even John Malchovic, in my opinion one of the best actors in the world, ********* Many people seeing this movie may be more interested in the battle scenes than the acting or historical accuracy.  About a third of the way through they won't be disappointed.  The war scene in the middle is admittedly good. Unfortunately for the next 2 hours even the action buffs will have to put up with the intense boredom of the remainder of the film.  All of the people I was with, half of who enjoyed the first part of the movie, were squirming in their seats by the end hoping for Joan to get burned so they could get out of the cinema.That all said, 157 people in IMDB still did rate the movie a 10.

To me, I don't bother whether the movie is far from history or psychotic or anything that makes me feel bad. As long as the movie is reasonable, no problem. Anyone who doesn't like the portrayal of Jeanne shouldn't take it personally. Chill out, it's only a movie. You can tell anyone how bad it is or even burn the DVD if you don't like it. Let's watch carefully before judging.In my opinion, this is the greatest movie depicting the middle ages. The scenes are fantastic and feel so real. You can even see the scratches on their armor plates, proof that they have been used before, unlike in some movies where the armor plates are just too shiny and clean even after they come back from the battle. You'd also find that the face of the soldiers make you wonder how bad the breath is. These details really matter for me so I decide in the first ten minutes of the movie that I should see more of it.As a lunatic, the character is well-done by Milla Jovovich. Some people complained that she overacted but I honestly feel that the acting really makes sense. Firstly, When Jeanne finally found Charles in his Castle, her eyes were so convinced that she had found the right person. Secondly, when she was interrogated by the court, she gave a good reason for the old men to give her an army. The ideas are very clear. Anytime an idea comes up, it is preceded with clear explanation. Thirdly, she only did everything she could when somebody crossed her. Screaming, Yelling, Glaring are often seen throughout the movie. She is lunatic, isn't she? It would be strange if she's calm. I guess that's why she behaved the way other people see it as overacting.This movie is full of emotion. In the first battle scene where she ordered the retreating army to counterattack is probably the best example how to suddenly improve troop's morale. Their gesture and the music also help make the scene looked heroic. You can feel how is it like when you are hopeless and then someone come and yell that she will give you victory and everybody raises his sword, charge towards the enemy, and yell as loud as they can, with her leading them..I wanna tell you so many incredible things but unfortunately it wouldn't feel as good as if you see it by yourself. Although not everyone would feel the same way as I do, at least you can try this film and judge later. Don't bring your feeling how this movie should be. However, some movies are just bad. I can assure you this one is not one of them.English is not my first language. So, sorry for bad grammar or anything. "},{"Title":"I don't think. I leave that to God. I'm nothing in all this, I'm just the Messenger.","Date":"2 December 2009","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Biography, Drama","Review":" A few unfortunate lines of dialogue aside, it's hard to see why Luc Besson's epic was met with such derision - it's full of some terrific film-making, the battles are the right size, the story's well-told and Milla Jovovich comes over surprisingly well as someone caught somewhere between God's will and psychosis. The inclusion, two hours in, of Dustin Hoffman as her conscience to address her own and the audience's doubts as to whether she is driven by divine guidance or self-delusion is an inspired touch that is completely unexpected in a mainstream epic on this scale. Unfortunately, it's also the point when the film almost crosses the line into Monty Python - the dialogue's just too funny too often, and somehow the notion of a 15th Century French Catholic peasant girl's conscience manifesting itself as a 62-year-old New York Jewish actor in a cowl doesn't seem overly likely. Curiously, these scenes work better on a second viewing when you're not caught so off-guard by them.On a narrative level, these scenes do help punctuate the back-and-forth nature of the trial, but it would have probably been much better to have her in her cell talking to her unseen visions. There are still some compensations. The trial is well-handled, and Timothy West avoids the kind of ham that usually marks his cinematic turns (cf Cry Freedom) to give a surprisingly good performance as a mainly decent man trapped in an impossible situation, very similar to Ray MacAnally's role in The Mission. It's not a flawless film by any means, but it is one of the better and more ambitious 90s epics and one that's long overdue for reappraisal.

It never happened, in fact I don't think the English even invaded Joan's village, it was the Burgundians (I think that's what there called). And Catherine doesn't die or get raped, like the disturbing scene from the movie shows. Second, the fact that Joa--err.. the *girl's* (she certainly isn't Joan of Arc) sister being raped and murdered drives her into wanting revenge on the English and so she deludes herself into thinking that God has summoned her, but all she really wants is revenge!! That is given away at the end of the film; it's so silly because it never happened at all.This film is a LIE, if you plan on watching it so you can learn more about St. Joan then avoid at all costs because you won't learn anything. It's not the REAL story of St. Joan of Arc.

Charles VII/Malkovich is fantastic (we're not far from Machiavel).The battle scenes seems to be realistic too .I enjoy particularly Vincent Cassel (as Gilles de Rais which will become a kid's killer) when he strikes with his fl√©au.

This movie does neither, its a real life story of incredible historical events that need no changes or the movie would lose its flavor.  Except this film cuts stuff out due to time constraints, which is understandable.  This film follows closely the Joan of Arc story, and does it on a believable budget, with incredible actors.  (Hoffman, Malcovich)  The makers did alot of research into the film, with the weapons and tactics used in those times, and how Joan historically handled herself with much faith, grace, and noble manner.  Joan played a realistic, holy person, not a hollywood Rambo.  It is a great film of faith and insperation, and I can watch it over and over again.  P S Hoffman plays a great role as the Devil, I will never forget his cameo.

All movies has it.Everyone loved Braveheart even knowing I hope that Willian Wallace wasn't a good guy at all, in fact, was one damn mean Scotsman.8/10 just because it's in English instead of french. "},{"Title":"Historically Inaccurate","Date":"15 December 2013","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Biography, Drama","Review":" The Messenger The Story of Joan of Arc gives no subtleties in its presentation of Joan of Arc. Its version of Joan comes from the theory that she had schizophrenia, to the exclusion of any other possibility. However, in The Messenger The Story of Joan of ArcThe script was badly written, confusing, and pulled the audience out of the suspension of disbelief. The writers ignored certain facts, and skewed others. Most importantly, they invented scenes and dialogue that 1) would be out of character for Joan and 2) we know for certain that we do not know. For example, in the scene when Joan rushed to her parish church and sloppily drank of the Eucharist&#x96;&#x96;she never would have done that. The historical Joan had too great a religious respect to commit a deadly sin such as that. Second example, the writers include the dialogue wherein she tells the Dauphin about her Revelations. No one knows what her Revelations were, so the writers of that scene had no basis of that whatsoever; the influence of their schizophrenic agenda is clear in the dialogue and Milla Jovovich's acting.The theory that Joan had schizophrenia is a legitimate argument. However, I found this film's presentation offensive and inadequate because of its lack of historical and realistic respect. The Messenger The Story of Joan of Arc set its theory up as the final and only theory, and bashed all other theories and monarchies and histories before it, seemingly because they existed before this film was made.

He makes this point in a way that is both contentious and insulting to the memory of Joan of Arc, and the proud history of France whose defenders had finally, and with a great deal of effort, regained most of their country from the English, with her inspiration and guidance. This victory was not complete; however, there were still English occupied territories, decades after her martyrdom.The Director places his words in the mouth of Joan, and if he had actually read even one of the many sources which give an extant record of her life, trial and rehabilitation, he would know that these were words she could never have spoken. The few lines he gives his Joan that can be recognized as authentic or similar to her actual words are usually used in the wrong context or repeated endlessly to no other effect than the one the director is successful in achieving; that she is a simple, mad, and a psychologically disturbed child.This too is how she is characterized and played by his actress, as a nervous, crazy, impulsive irrational and immature child. Why if he dislikes her so, would he go to all the trouble of making a movie to show such an inaccurate and tainted likeness of her? It seems he is both fascinated with Joan and her story, and also enraged by her and what she stands for. He finds it unacceptable that if God does, in fact, exist, that the possibility that God choosing to act through an illiterate and unintelligent peasant girl is highly unlikely, therefore God does not exist or Joan was simply mad, that is the only logical explanation, right?

He brings such an energy to the role, helping highlight the stressed-out intensity of Joan and the smirky smarminess of the Dauphin/King. He made me want to ride into battle alongside him. To arms! To arms! Highlander fans may also recognize Richard Ridings (La Hire) as one of Highlander's Four Horsemen (Silas).I read that the American test audiences for this movie 1.) didn't want Joan to be burned at the end and suggested a re-write where she lives, and 2.) weren't sure where the movie was taking place. Has education really gone that far down the tubes in this country?.

Once Besson's penis started making creative decisions it was over with this movie and maybe his career as a whole. Once a penis gets its slippery head in the door it's bye-bye quality. For a penis cares not about Jovovich's talents; the only talents a director's penis cares for are the other talents. And Jovovich's magic triangle must have put quite a spell on Besson's single-minded one-eyed warrior, to the extent that he actually cast her in his second consecutive movie! Jovovich's performance is as one-dimensional as it gets; her Joan is always manic, silly, unconvincing, fanatical, humourless, and insane. A scene in which Milla tries to inspire her troops just before a battle, has the opposite effect on the viewer than was intended instead of impressing the viewers as well (like Gibson in Braveheart), she causes them to wonder why a single soldier would want to follow this six-foot floozy-supermodel-turned-bad-actress into battle. There is only one other woman &#150; from the fashion world - who would have been much worse than Jovovich Claudia Schiffer. But it's just a matter of time before Schiffer, too, traps a major director's penis into submission and unconditional surrender. Plus, Jovovich is not particularly attractive &#150; and I'm being very diplomatic and nice about it now. She has something masculine about her, and the hair-cut she has in the film only emphasizes my point.The movie is visually rather nice, and the battle scenes are quite good &#150; after all, a lot of money was invested in this - but there is a lack of seriousness which undermines the movie. Besson clearly didn't have a clue whether he was making a gung-ho not-too-serious adventure movie or a dark, somber historical drama. The film meanders between heavy drama, and ridiculous French slip-on-a-banana-peel silliness.Overall, not as bad as many people who hate the movie claim, but with quite a few major flaws.

It was informative and the battle scenes were great which prevents the audience from getting bored. It was a good movie. Definitely NOT bad as some people would say. It's just sad that this movie was overlooked. Also, I think Milla Jovovich did a great job of playing the role of St. Joan of Arc. Her acting was amazing. I watched some movies of Milla Jovovich and I could say that of all her movies, it is in this one THAT HER ACTING ABILITIES SHINE! Definitely NOT the kind of acting people label on models-trying-hard-to-be-actresses. Here, Milla's acting abilities is at par with the acting abilities of some Hollywood female A-listers.I don't know why other people would say that her acting was bad in the movie. I think it's because some people can't admit that a woman can be beautiful and can act at the same time.

Almost threw my TV out into the middle of the street. Hollywood's constant attempts to degrade Christians, their beliefs, and their martyrs, Saints, is disgusting. Never see any movies portray other Religions or leaders of any minority groups/movements, any leftist crappy causes in a negative or disrespectful light.
