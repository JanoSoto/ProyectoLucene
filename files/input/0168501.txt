[{"Title":"the best man's wedding flick !","Date":"6 September 2005","Score":"13 out of 13 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" I saw this five years ago on DVD and grabbed it the other day in the video store wanting an oldie/goodie. So tired of watching homogenized films about stealing the groom from the bride; cheating on the bride-to-be while on a road-trip in wine country; the sad/depressed bridesmaid/maid-of-honor tragically gets dumped by her escort; blah-blah-blah. What this film offers us instead is something in the eyes of four Af-Am buddies who get together before one of them ties the knot. And there are no race cards pulled. The film does not zero on one of the characters and their drug/alcohol problem, or gang-related problemos, or any stereotypical stuff like that. No- what Malcolm Lee did instead was deliver us with an ensemble cast who just happen to be black, mix in a smooth R & B soundtrack with it and a give us a fun premise.It's simple Harper (Diggs) is on the brink of publishing his first novel with characters loosely based on his friends from college. He flies to New York to get together with his buddies before attending his friend's wedding. During that time, he encounters an old flame that got away; the changes in ideology and values with others. But on the night of the bachelor party, Lance (Chestnut) gets his paws on a copy and reads it, puzzling together the composites while blaming Diggs for cheating with his fianc√©e.Taye Diggs, Nia Long, Morris Chestnut, Terrence Dashon Howard, Harold Perrineau, Monica Calhoun, Sanaa Lathan, and the rest of all the cast get the fattest props because without their acting, this would've been a train wreck. What makes these characters so unique and human is that they're not stereotypical caricature's and each of them all evolve their own style. Taye Diggs is the quiet pragmatist of them all, yet he's no dork. Morris Chestnut is Lance the football player/groom-to-be. Harold Perrineau is the hopelessly, pathetically whipped brother-man with heart and Terrence Dashon Howard (from this year's Crash)steals every scene he's in as the cynical but cool cat musician buddy. Nia Long is the former flame of Taye Diggs with Sanaa Lathan as his girlfriend.Yeah, the story is a little predictable. Yeah, it's a little lewd and sexist (the scene at the poker table, but I love those lines Bite it!, Grow it!). The very ending is something we've seen before, yet it's funny anyway. Only problem was that this film was probably labeled as a black film at the time and that was probably why it received such poor box office (a'la Waiting to Exhale, Boomerang). Perhaps Hollywood wasn't ready to see that and preferred a movie about a suburban, white, dysfunctional family instead. Oh, and gave it Best Picture, too.

Character based scripts walk a delicate line, but somehow most seem to reap in undeserving praises (St. Elmo's Fire, The Big Chill).  Not to sound like a self-righteous broken record, but I truly believe The Best Man was passed over because it happened to have an African American cast.  It was instantly labeled a black movie, before anyone bothered to watch more than the trailer, which is a crying shame, because what everyone missed out on was a fine film.The characters range from classic (Morris Chestnut's Lance) to surprisingly fresh (Terrence Howard's Quentin), all with very distinct personalities, yet believable connections.  (Am I the only one who is so sick of using the went to college together excuse for why some film characters are friends, despite the obvious fact that in reality the cool rebel doesn't hang with the prudish nerd and so on.)Not only does the film have refreshing takes on the inter-dimensional relationships of characters, it's not afraid to face the characters honestly, to show each individual's flaws...they have depth, soul, contradictions, much like REAL PEOPLE!  Amazing! The themes are universal; friends, love, mistakes, forgiveness.  The dialogue is witty, yet not overly done to sound like movie dialogue that no one in the real world speaks.And though the race of the characters does not matter in this movie, I applaud Malcolm D. Lee for writing a film featuring black characters that are all successful, independent and intelligent.  No one is rapping or drug dealing, no one is blaming the man for setbacks.  The characters actually represent the MAJORITY of the black community, just regular people, living their lives. How refreshing from the Hollywood stereotypes, believed by suburban white America, that every successful black man is a rapper or a basketball player and every other one a criminal or janitor.  It's a shame this film didn't make for money,  perhaps then we'd see more of this trend, movies based on script rather than race.Though I loved it, this film probably won't change your life.  It's not one that will ever be considered one of the best films ever (though I think it took bold steps in closing the race gap in film).  And I'm not saying it's an absolute must-see for everyone.  But for discerning viewers with perhaps some taste and hunger for something a little different, I recommend you treat yourself to something that you probably haven't seen in a long time a simply good movie.

As a 30 year old African American male, I thought the movie did an excellent job of exploiting the young, college-grad, working class African American.  This movie has the potential to appeal to a very diverse audience of males.  Conservative females probably will not like this movie that much because of the strong sexual content.  However, the truths of the issues addressed were so accurately portrayed, that it shouldn't be a total lost for the conservative female.  Also, the entire cast did a great job.Nevertheless, I most pay special homage to Terrence Dashon Howard (as Quentin).  He gave a top-notched, award-deserving performance.  If anybody in that movie deserves and award or any kind of special mention, it is by a long shot, Terrence.  He made this movie-going experience for me that much more enjoyable.  I can't wait to see what he does next.  I've never been before, but I am definitely now a Terrence Dashon Howard fan.  Furthermore, the entire cast was beautiful; particularly the women.  I don't ever before remember seeing so many fine women on screen before at one time.  Once out on video, this movie will definitely go in my video library collection.

The film tells the tale of a handsome up-and-coming writer whose first novel has just been published on the eve of his best friend's wedding.  The problem is that much of the material in the book has been drawn from autobiographical sources &#150; and now, as old friends gather for the ceremony, the author and best man, Harper Stewart, has to face the fallout from some of the less than flattering portrayals contained therein.  In addition, the novel contains the revelations of a few hitherto well-guarded secrets, some of which bear directly on the principals involved in the wedding itself.Ironically, the primary strength of the film also emerges as its overarching weakness.   The movie provides so richly textured a depiction of the interrelationships between and among the wide assortment of characters that it alternately straddles the line between fascination and tedium.  On the positive side, writer/director Malcolm D. Lee is not afraid to give the characters their due, to allow them to reveal their many-layered personalities in scenes that play out in real-time tempo and rhythm.  One appreciates the fact that we are not being rushed along from one highly dramatic moment to another without time to really get to know the characters as people.  The counter effect of this, however, is that the film often seems too talky, self-indulgent and dramatically flat, a fact not helped by the excessive 122-minute running time.  In addition, the whole novel-publishing aspect of the story seems both unnecessary and contrived, not to mention lacking in credibility since it becomes a bit difficult to believe that, if he were so terrified about his friends discovering his true perceptions of them, Harper would have written the novel in the first place.  Moreover, when we hear voice-over recitations of a few sections of the novel itself, we are struck dumb that so badly written and trite a work could be so critically lauded and commercially successful.However, the film's virtues do, ultimately, outweigh its imperfections.  The actors and actresses turn in uniformly fine performances and the film deals intelligently and sensitively with the age-old issues of the fear of commitment and the two-faced attitude many men have when it comes to female infidelity.  Lee, within the context of his characters, confronts these issues with subtlety rather than heavyhandedness and the last half hour or so of the film turns into a very moving celebration of the qualities of acceptance, commitment and sacrifice necessary to make a relationship truly work.  `The Best Man' may require a little patience at times to get through, but the reward for those willing to give it a try makes it worth the effort.

As an avid moviegoer, this was the very first Black movie made in recent decades that was done right.  As a first major endeavor for Malcolm Lee, my hat is off to him for portraying young, successful, upper-middle class African-Americans in a solid storyline that was at once heart-warming, funny, serious at times, but light at others.  Overall... simply very well done.  The character's development was executed eloquently and, at times so subtly, I nearly missed some things.  The cinematography, costumes and sets were all as they should be  done with class.This young, successful, upper-middle class African-American says thanks for finally doing it right.

The ensemble cast clicks and clashes with one another at just the right moments.  Taye Diggs's character, Harper, is charming and charismatic, but WHY would he write a book that causes pain to those close to him?  Is it to enlighten his friends or to reveal his own frailties?  Perhaps, a little of both.There is a good mix of very funny and also intense emotional moments and the audience is captured; cheering some of the cast and hissing others.  It's quite uncanny that transformation occurs for certain characters especially when it's needed.  Terrence Howard's character, Quentin, is a prime example.  At the beginning of the film Quentin is basically a guy who lacks direction and propriety in his behavior.  Over the course of the film, he becomes the voice of wisdom and the glue that holds it together for those closest to him.Malcolm Lee's directorial debut is quite admirable in this well paced, universally appealing film.

Taye Diggs alone is worth the price of admission -- he is charismatic and captures the screen -- and unlike the choices Sidney Poitier and Denzel Washington either had to make or chose to make he is definitely sexy; this is almost a Chick Flick but it's actually about four guys.The movie was written and directed by a cousin of Spike Lee, who produced it, and oy did it need editing and trimming. Every scene in what is in effect a black, younger Big Chill dragged on too long and was mostly too straight-forwardly directed. There is a writing talent in there that needs help in a collaborative art form to be shown to best effect. The flashbacks didn't make musical sense (except one excellent use of a Stevie Wonder song) or hair style changes so I found it unspecific about time period or college we were flashing back to.The black audience laughed along with the male/female portrayals so I guess they weren't annoyed by the trash-talking guy who automatically called his bro's n----r or the acceptance of double-standards such that strong black professional women with active sex lives are sentenced to be old maids while only submissive or otherwise un-together black women are worth marrying. The cinematography was rich, particularly lingering on beautiful, chocolate-colored skin.It felt like a first movie the way first novels do -- but that was part of the theme as it's about a first-time novelist writing a roman a clef. But all the cast and the writer are clearly up and coming talents.(originally written 11/14/1999) "},{"Title":"Quentin","Date":"8 August 2005","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" ****MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS**** This movie was great. I never get tired of seeing it. I really like Quentin's character. He stole every scene he was in. I kind of wish they had made a spin off with his character because he was really interesting. I would have liked to have seen the relationship he had with his father because from the way him and Harper talked it seemed his father was always on him about choosing a career and the last thing he needed was for Harper to be doing that to him. Like he didn't need another father figure who didn't approve of his lifestyle. With the way the movie ended I think it would have been good to develop a story between him and Shelby. See where that would go. Also show him in his playing ways and also show him playing the guitar a lot more like he was working on putting together a record, the way he played was tight. But if they were to make a movie on just his character only Terrence Howard could play him and only Malcolm Lee would be able to pull off a great job directing it.

The personality of Quentin, arguably the most complex and fascinating character, was a bit of a tease, and like some of the other viewers, I was hungry for more of him! Nia Long always turns in superb performances, and this one doesn't disappoint.  The weakest link in the film was Taye Diggs, whose acting is about as animated as a cigar store Indian . . . but judging from the female audience reaction every time he took off his shirt, acting ability may be irrelevant to his career.

He's had small parts in The Call and Identity Thief but he's yet to become a household name. Harold Perrineau is known for his character in Lost but he's yet to take on a leading role.

In The Best Man, we're given a relatively fast paced story, but without any elements that make you feel like there's something interesting to be going on. There are lots of conversations between the characters-- males mostly--, but the story feels too contrived. It lacks fun, engagement or surprise. In my opinion, it felt boring from the first ten minutes and never got back-- at least until 50 minutes, which is how much I tried to enjoy it before turning off.

I keep seeing the writer in the room saying, But this really happened, for the plot appears to be a lame adaptation of some post-college celebrity's life experience.What actually happens in this movie is unclear, and not made any more clear by the jagged, amateur editing and directing which (maybe for the best) distracts us from the first half hour of the film.  Thence on, the viewer is subjected to a reunion of college buddies getting together for the wedding of a famous friend.  Doubt and betrayal appear and disappear magically, as in all buddy-wedding films, but instead of adding to the cliched plot, Best Man takes away from it, destroying the charm and levity of the original. What is left is nonsensical anger, contrived forgiveness, and a waste of time.

It was refreshing to see very beautiful African-American people on screen.  They were not only intelligent, educated, goal-oriented and purposeful, the films portrayal did not conform to the typical white romantic comedies.  The film has been criticized by some as being too black or ethnic.  The film has been criticized for using the term n***ger.  I found the style of communication among the gentlemen in the film as cool and laid back.  There was something very eloquent in the way the characters carried themselves. I believe the film would have lost it's integrity if it had conformed to a Notting Hill like appeal.  It would have made the film seem very artificial and pretentious.  Rather, the fact that the film did not assimilate to a mainstream romantic comedy genre should be considered a credit.  It shows that African-Americans can be intelligent and purposeful in life  and yet remain integral to black culture.  The film included humor, sentiments, and expressions proudly exemplified in black America.  But then again some people like pretentious and artificial films.  Finally, I think this film is more important for white Americans then black Americans.  For black America it finally provides some equality to how the black American experience is being presented on film (not one gun or bag of cocaine). However, mainstream American society has an internalized and very limited view of what it means to be an African-American.  And anytime an African-American escapes outside of the box (as this film graceful did), it holds he or she under scrutiny.  Hopeful for white America the film will help de-internalize the mal-depiction of African-Americans in Hollywood and society.  And then maybe through these films both blacks and whites can find some common ground and truly co-exist with mutual love and respect.  I hope this film creates a standard for black film making.  It looks like Malcolm Lee has started off on the right foot.  I apologize if my comments sound too political.

It  fails to address the very serious issue of dishonesty and infidelity that were very much a part of the relationship between the bride and the groom. The groom never even sat down to talk to his bride about what he had found out about her and his best man. He never addressed the fact that she lied to him about being a virgin. I particularly found it really disturbing for the groom to be standing in the church taking his wedding vows and imagining his woman in bed with another man. I mean what are we supposed to take from this faith in God will conquer all, forget about the importance of good and open communication between man and wife? Just party and dance your problems away? Pul-leze! Are we to believe that this stuff wasn't going to be an issue between the two of them  in the future? That it wouldn't be the first thing he throws in her face? I know folks will say it's just a movie, but it's a movie with a message and I think the message got badly garbled in the end. There are a lot of young people out there in general  -- and especially African-American youth -- who have a very romantic notion of what love and marriage are supposed to be about. Hell, there are a lot of 30, 40 and 50-something with overly romantic notions. If you're going to tell a story about faith, love, honesty, fidelity why not address the tough stuff, too?

On top of that, his friends have their own problems and neuroses and Harper has to decide if he is finally ready for commitment with his girlfriend, who he loves very much but seems to keep distant from in certain areas.Yes, it's a romantic comedy-drama full of moments that we've seen done before and while unoriginality is not a cinematic sin (or, good grief, we would rarely see any film released in cinemas) it isn't a good thing when everything has been done BETTER than the movie you're currently watching.The cast is appealing enough (Diggs is fine, Morris Chestnut is very good, Nia Long is lovely, Terrence Howard is a standout and Harold Perrineau is great as the one whipped male of the group) and even the supporting members do well (Regina Hall is cuter than she's ever been and Sanaa Lathan makes the most of her limited character . . . the girl that Diggs should realise he wants to keep hold of) but this movie limps along thanks to a dull script and flat direction with nothing to really immerse you in the movie's environment.A romantic comedy-drama with unfunny comedy, romance you don't care for and drama that starts to unfold before you even get to know who's involved in it all.

The film centers on a group of college buddies who are reuniting for a wedding. Things get sticky when one of the group has written an about to be published novel, where the characters are just thinly disguised versions of his friends and how revelations in this book alter and shake the foundations of these relationships. Taye Diggs is attractive as Harper, the author of the book and the best man at the wedding; Morris Chestnut plays a professional football player and the groom; Nia Long is sexy and funny as Jordan, a TV journalist/Oprah wannabe who hopes to rekindle a romance with Harper at the wedding; Harold Perrineau plays a grade school teacher caught in a stranglehold of a relationship with an emasculating female (Melissa DeSousa); Terrence Howard steals every scene he is in as this group's voice of reality; Sanaa Lathan plays Harper's fianc√©e who can't get Harper to commit and Monica Calhoun is the bride who is at the center of the explosion caused by the book.

Coincidence or not, the main character of Harper Stewart (Taye Diggs) is a writer as well, and references to Hughes and Wright are in the film. Harper has just had his first novel published, has a beautiful girlfriend (Saana Lathan), and seems to have it all together. He's nervous about commitment and the reaction to his book, which serves as a fictional interpretation of his young adult life. Harper is certainly justified in his worry, as he doesn't pull any punches, and once the real versions of his characters read what he's written about them, he has to face his mistakes and be, literally, the best man he can be.The film centers around one whirlwind weekend that has the four main characters reminiscing in advance of Lance Sullivan's (Morris Chestnut) wedding. Lance is a pro footballer, engaged to Mia (Monica Calhoun), who has stood by him despite his egregious lack of fidelity. My guess is that Mia doesn't even know the half of it. Lance is a classic alpha male- he's so strong in body and belief, but cannot make the connection between his steadfast conviction and keeping it in his pants. So, like many men, he's a 'dog'. Harper is a 'dog' in a different way- he's sneaky in his selfishness, and takes those that love him for granted. Quentin (Terrence Howard) is a knowing, world-weary 'dog'- he's been around the block, has known his share of disappointments, and brings balance to this group of friends. Howard's turn here (the first I was exposed to him) lends gravity to the film- he's the one who knows what's going to go down once the dirty laundry is aired, because he's already gone through the maturation process that the other three haven't. Murch (Harold Perrineau from 'Lost') is the spineless 'dog'. He clearly lacks the confidence to stand up for himself, and therefore doesn't have what he really wants.As I mentioned before, Carver's influence is present, intentional or not. It's never more evident than the poker game our main group shares, and the way the characters interact. What is said during this particular scene provides deep insights into gender roles, relationships, sex, religion, honesty, and loyalty- all within a 10 minute scene. The men may talk crudely, but the truths are clear. These men are good, caring people, but have done selfish things. No amount of aggression can keep the powerful truths from coming out, truths that Harper's book give away. It says something for a film that might be seen as a traditional rom-com that instead says something about really becoming a man.Without giving away everything, let's just say that eventually it hits the fan. By then, we're so invested in the characters that the reactions from all involved seem justified. Lance must face the music in the most powerful way- in the moment that should be his greatest, he's finally humbled for his indiscretions. Perhaps it's Morris Chesnut's performance, or maybe the script is that good, but in that moment I felt both a satisfaction and a sadness for his character's punishment. Quentin is finally rewarded by the film for being the 'cool, level-headed' one that leads the characters towards the truth, Murch grows a pair and gracefully moves on from his overbearing, confidence-sucking girl, and Harper? He's forced to be self- reflective, to recognize the good in his life, the need versus the want, and to not take things for granted. All of the character arcs, including the females, make sense in their conclusions. It's something that can only happen when a filmmaker cares enough about the characters. Most adults have been through similar life events and the emotions that go with them; this movie respects its audience enough to challenge them with specific thoughts about manhood, relationships, change, and the like. It's rare for that to happen, but it's what Carver's book did, and what this film does as well.Sure, there are some problems with the film. For whatever reason, the script requires these characters to have the most bombastic and presidential names, insisting that they say those full names over and over for the first quarter of the film. It's overtly obvious that Malcolm Lee thought it necessary to establish these people as successful, professional, driven individuals to distance this film from others released in the same vein. Unfortunately it comes across as awkward; they're the kind of names little girls give to tea party guests. Harper Stewart. Jordan Armstrong. Lance Sullivan. Julian Murch. Shelby. Robyn. Mia Morgan. Candace. There's something&#x85;off about that. As well, the perfunctory and impromptu proposal by our lead seems oddly misplaced, especially considering his apparent understanding of the situation; I'm not sure that a humbled character like Harper should be leaping back into the fire he just escaped.Obviously I forgive the film that minor slip. It's important to note that this cost 9 million to make in 1999. Considering that many of the cast members have continued working since then, many successfully, and considering this film's appeal why not revisit the characters? It's a good opportunity when it normally wouldn't exist for a romantic comedy, and I'm looking forward to seeing how these characters have progressed 15 years later when The Best Man Holiday comes out.

The characters qualify as intelligent, positive, upscale role models and stereotypes appear conspicuously absent in this seriocomic account of a weekend college reunion before a classmate's wedding.Happily, The Best Man shuns racism either as a political issue or as a narrative theme. Actually, this lighthearted but occasionally down to earth comedy of errors looks and sounds like something Oscar Wilde or George Bernard Shaw might have penned. The point is that The Best Man emerges as a polished mainstream comedy where the characters are first and foremost people with all of the foibles and frailties of mankind. A strong ensemble cast headed by charismatic Taye Diggs, who won over audiences in When Stella Got Her Groove Back, distinguishes writer Lee's accomplished directorial debut. Unlike his famous, more often controversial brother Spike Lee, Malcolm sticks to the story and avoids tangents.Chicago author Harper Stewart (Taye Diggs of Go) has just written his first novel. Appropriately entitled 'Unfinished Business,' Stewart's about to be published story has been picked up by Oprah Winfrey's book club. Life couldn't be better for the novice novelist. The froth of Harper's success fizzles when he learns that his ex-college flame, BET-TV producer Jordan Armstrong (Nia Long of Friday) has circulated an advance copy of his semi-autobiographical effort among his close chums. When Harper arrives in New York City for the weekend festivities surrounding the impending marriage of football star Lance Sullivan (Morris Chestnut of Half Past Dead) and Mia Morgan (Monica Calhoun of Love & Basketball), he finds himself up to his ears in hot water.Naturally, Harper's friends have perused his novel. They bicker about who he used as models for his fictional characters. Things come to a boil when Lance suspects the worst. He believes that his sweetheart Mia may have bedded down with Harper, the guy he chose to serve as his best man. Reluctantly, Harper confesses, and the once philandering football star blackens his eye at their stag party and then threatens to throw him off the balcony. Lance calls off the wedding without warning Mia and then storms out of the party. Harper realizes grimly that he must patch things up. The next day everybody shows up at the church in their finest garb, but poor Mia has no idea why Lance is tardy.The Best Man is the equivalent of Terry McMillan for guys. They form a closely-knit group of friends who have achieved success of their own right after college. Predictably, their reunion sparks old rivalries and bitter jealousies. Harper finds himself in trouble long before he arrives in the Big Apple to celebrate with his friends. Just as his publishing career is gaining momentum, Harper's girlfriend goads him about a commitment that he balks at giving. Quentin (Terrence Howard of Iron Man) is a cynical career drifter who cannot find a woman for himself but who doles out advice to Julian Murch (Harold Perrineau, Jr., of The Matrix Reloaded) about how to deal with his prima donna girlfriend Shelby (Melissa De Sousa of Biker Boyz). Finally, Lance has decided to settle down now that he has inked a $5-million contract to play for the New York Giants.The Best Man towers as a four-star romantic comedy in the tradition of The Big Chill with characters who never get short-changed and an ending that is agreeably believable.

Get a handful of the most insanely gorgeous Black actors, set the movie in a popular metropolitan city, add a trendy r&b soundtrack, get plenty of promotion on BET and Vibe magazine, and--voila!--you have a box office hit in your hands.  These movies may smartly dodge ghetto stereotypes, but they resort to the same chick flick chiches that you'd find in a, say, Julia Roberts or Meg Ryan film.  Taye Diggs is Harper Stewart, a struggling actor who flies to New York to be the best man of his college buddy's wedding and just completed a novel called Unfinished Business.  The book, as well as Harper's shady past, causes all sorts of friction between his friends and his love interest Jordan, played by Nia Long.  I'll be a good sport and I won't risk revealing any spoilers, but even if I did, it wouldn't be a big deal.  Not only is the plot predictable, but the characters do not possess not an ounce of realness or believability.  I don't know what kind of book deal Harper Stewart has, but it must be a lucrative one considering his GQ wardrobe.  Nia Long isn't required to do anything more than look pretty and act feisty, while Morris Chestnut remains a promising actor trapped, yet again, in a poorly written role.  The only character I liked was Shelby (Melissa De Sousa).  The script makes her look like a total drama queen, but if I were always in the company of such shallow status-conscious people like Harper and Jordan, I, too, would be agitated as Shelby was.  Don't get me wrong; The Best Man is a well-produced movie.  But the gloss is there to trick you into thinking that the film is way better than it actually is.  The discerning viewer will notice the con job right away.

What `Notting Hill' and `The Best Man' have in common is that they are well written, sweet and funny romantic comedies with charming performances, the two best of its genre to come out this year.  `The Best Man' wasn't as good as `Notting Hill,' but that doesn't matter, I still loved it.  The film stars Taye Diggs, who has been a very busy boy lately.  He has been in four movies in the last seven months and I hope he doesn't suffer from overexposure because he is a very talented actor.The film was directed by newcomer Malcolm Lee, cousin of Spike Lee, one of the most innovative, powerful and underrated directors in the industry.  `The Best Man,' oddly, reminded me of Woody Allen's 1997 film `Deconstructing Harry,' which also has a plot about a novel's account of personal relationships of the author.  Its portrayal of African-Americans is very positive and direct.  Hollywood often makes the terrible mistake of making black people drug-dealers, gangsters, pimps and slaves when they can be just as well adjusted and normal as white people.  Interestingly enough, I wouldn't even call `The Best Man' a black film because the turmoils the characters face in this film are universal and can relate to anyone.  Part of the picture's strongest features is how it discusses and deals with relationships and how business and pleasure should never collide.  This is one of the year's best films.

This time around the cast is African American and for once this is not a Blacksploitational film. Yes there are plenty of in jokes and idiosyncrasies that perhaps not everyone in the audience will 'get', but the story works well and the cast is one of the best collected on film.Four very handsome men - Taye Diggs, Morris Chestnut, Harold Perrineau, and Terrence Howard - are the male side of wedding party, the very beautiful women being Nia Long, Sanaa Lathan, Monica Calhoun and Melissa De Sousa - and these beautiful actors immerse themselves in a story with many twists and lessons and appear to be having the time of their lives doing it. Taye Diggs has the lead and continues to show his growth as an actor. But it is the pleasure of seeing the now famous Terrence Howard in one of his many early roles that makes the film truly worthwhile. Not a great movie, but a film of sound production and some of the most appealing actors around!

Even though the plot has been seen hundreds of times, buddies getting together for a wedding and long simmering secrets come bubbling to the surface.  However, the thing that helps make this film better than what it could have been is the great ensemble cast headed by Omar Epps, Morris Chestnut and Nia Long.  The three of them had great chemistry and really made this film a treat to watch.

Also everbody looks great--men and women.  That's about it for compliments.  The Best Man involves a bunch of college friends getting together for a wedding.  However, one of them has just written a thinly disguised book about his college years and reveals some secrets that shouldn't be revealed.  Naturally all hell breaks loose.  Plotwise, that's nothing new--also the characters are nothing new.  All the men are afraid of marriage (I'm SO sick of that being used as a plot), all the women are ready for it.  These characters have been done before and this movie offers nothing new.  They keep talking and talking and TALKING about the same things we've heard before.  None of the characters are likable--there isn't one person in this movie that I liked or found believable.  The plot moves very slowly, and the same events are talked over again and again.  As the main character Taye Diggs is (suprisingly) bad.  Everything else I've seen him in he's been good.  So why is he so terrible in this?  All the other actors are OK.  Also, is it possible to have a movie with black guys that doesn't have them calling each other n****r constantly AND swearing a blue streak?  If these were urban youths I could accept it, but these are college-educated men!  Also there is extremely sexist dialogue (against women) and they're portrayed as either witches or sex objects.  Don't even get me started on the script--it's boring!!!!!  I kept dozing off during the endless talking.  Nothing wrong with lots of dialogue, but make it interesting!  Let's have more movies like this, BUT with better scripts and better actors!

Any woman who dares to think of herself as equal is doomed to misery. "}]
