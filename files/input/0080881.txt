This show was to take place during Viet Nam era. I would say this is a movie for guys. Good looking muscle cars throughout the show. Hey they even cruise the burger joint !!!!! Good Motown music throughout. This show is the ultimate in high school pranks. Great cast of actors. Unbelievable what teenagers can get into when they're away from home.There are some very good moments of growing up in this film. Some one leaving to go to Viet Nam not sure if he'll come back to see his friends, so he hangs out with them the night before he leaves. The usual boy falls in love with girl ,then girl leaves for college stuff. Some good street drag scenes. A high school initiation quest. There are a lot more stories in this very well scripted film that are all TOO real. If you ever wondered what your parents did in the sixties then you need to watch the fun they had. It really did look like a blast.

This film basically has no plot save for the fact that Tubby's Drive-in is shutting down and the Hollywood Knights converge there for one last hurrah. Most of their hijinks take place elsewhere however, but Tubby's is their hangout. The movie is a series of comedy sketches rather than a straightforward progression. The cast plays their roles to the hilt led by the frenetic stylings of Robert Wuhl (Newbomb). Also outstanding are Stuart Pankin as Dudley (the much-maligned honor student), and Gailard Sartain and Sandy Helberg as Officers Bimbeau and Clark.   One point I notice in other reviews and which I have to agree wholeheartedly with is that the subplots featuring Tony Danza/Michelle Pfeiffer and Jimmy Shine/Vietnam both contrive to slow the film down. This can be excused though, thanks to such gems as Newbomb's rendition of Volare, the one-armed violinist and the catered reception. Bottom line it's a lewd and crude laugh-riot!!!

It is badly acted, there are any number of continuity goofs (like Moosie Dreier being in two places at once) and there are many racist and sexist jokes. However, if you want to laugh and forget the real world for a few minutes, then this film is for you. This movie launched the careers of Tony Danza, Bob Wuhl, Joyce Heyser, Gailhard Sartain, Stuart Pankin, and Michelle Pfifer. There were great cars and there was great music, although some of the music was post 1965. The California surf-and-drag culture was very appealing. I grew up in the Midwest and went to catholic schools during cold winters, and I can imagine was CA must have been like. Another favorite movie of mine is also set in 1965, Heaven Help Us. The contrast is extreme. To kids who were swimming bare in cold pools and getting the paddle in gym class, the prospect of endless sunshine and girls in bikinis would have been otherworldly. And no teachers to worry about, just two dumb cops who were easy to outwit. And what I would not have given to be a student at Beverly Hills High!

But the one-liners and the jokes remained fresh in my mind for all these years, and now it is available ( finally, after 20 years !! ) on VHS and DVD. I must admit the R-rated jokes are not for the easily-offended, but they are FUNNY, and that's what being young in the early-mid 60's was all about... hot rods, music, women, and just having a good time. Years after I saw it for the first time, many of the actors kept appearing in new roles and I asked myself Hey, wasn't he (or she) in the Hollywood Knights cast ? This is one of the few movies I can remember in which this happened several times (Pfeiffer, Danza, Pankin, Dresher, Wuhl, Helberg and Graham ). Every time I hear Domenico Modugno or Bobby Rydell sing Volare, Newbomb's cover version pops in my mind.

The loose plot takes place in 1965 (even though some of the characters retain their late-seventies hairstyles) and is centered around the closing of Tubby's, a favorite local teen hangout. There's a group of pranksters called The Hollywood Knights who decide to say farewell to Tubby's' by playing practical jokes on stuffy adults and police officers. This includes spiking the punch at a party, stuffing the toilets, and doing other such childlike shenanigans. A few of these are humorous, but most of them fall flat. Throughout the movie are strewn many classic old '50s and '60s tunes, something of a consolation. Stand-up comedian Robert Wuhl plays the lead gang member, called Newbomb Turk. He's got at least one funny bit involving Fran Drescher as a gorgeous bimbo who he manages to get in the back seat of his car, but not for very long (it's the best scene in the film). There is a fat cop who becomes the frequent victim of the Knights' gags, which isn't too bad. And last and least, we get Michelle Pfeiffer and TAXI's Tony Danza taking up unnecessary screen time as a couple going through some troubles in extraneous segments which are completely unrelated and take you out of the movie. ** out of **** "}{"Title":"A Classic in the Genre of Raunch","Date":"19 January 2009","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" A sort of comedic companion to American Graffiti, this movie saw its popularity blossom when it was first aired on cable TV in 1982, two years after its theatrical release.

Yes, it combines elements of American Graffiti (drive-in, cars, songs, anecdotes of early 60s) with bad-taste prank humor of Animal House (and a whole slew of late 70s/early 80s youth movies Porky's, Stripes, Used Cars, Caddyshack, Revenge of the Nerds etc.--has anyone noticed they follow in the footsteps of M*A*S*H with the anti-authoritarian class-consiousness, but for teens?) but what's interesting is how it fits right in with Floyd Mutrux's previous movies Aloha Bobby & Rose and American Hot Wax and looks forward to There Goes My Baby, which is like a serious remake of this same movie. So he wasn't just following a trend; this is really his personal style and subject matter. I guess the humor will appeal to those who dig mooning and farting, but two boring subplots keep bringing it to a dead halt (SPOILERS) the whole Danza/Pfeiffer who-cares relationship and the guy who's going to Vietnam the next day. During these scenes, I was actually wishing we could get back to the T&A. Maybe they stuck them in so we could go to the bathroom? Sure it's a great soundtrack--so find an oldies CD, like the one for Graffiti which has several of the same songs! Really, this ain't the gem some people make out. To those who think it's one of funniest movies ever, check back after catching His Girl Friday, Miracle of Morgan's Creek, Duck Soup, Stage Door, One Two Three or Take the Money and Run.

Unfortunately, because the Warner Music Group has boycotted any of its recordings from the site, part 7 in a series of 10-minute segments of The Hollywood Knights had no audio which I figured had the three Atlantic artists that were credited at the end. As a result, I missed the dialogue of Tony Danza, Michelle Pfeiffer, and some Knights with a Doo-Wop group, one of whom I recognized as T.K. Carter. If I eventually hear this missing segment, I'll add my comments of it to this review. Now, for the most part I enjoyed this movie especially the scenes with Robert Wuhl, Stuart Pankin, and Fran Drescher especially her attempt to have sex with Wuhl in the car. The cop scene in the clogged bathroom was a little embarrassing. The punch scene with some of the comments made afterwards was pretty hilarious. Many of the Danza/Pfeiffer scenes were a nice drama though I didn't really see a connection with the more prankish scenes. And I loved all those scenes with that adulterous school faculty woman and the man she's fooling around with especially those with Pankin. And how about Wuhl's version of Volare? Or the one-armed violinist? So on that note, yeah, I recommend The Hollywood Knights. P.S. It's now several hours later and I've heard the missing scene I mentioned earlier. Touching speech from that guy about to go to Vietnam about if anything happens to him just before The Mamas and the Papas California Dreamin' plays on the 8-Track. And the Doo-Wop group sings a fine version of The Drifters Under the Boardwalk as they help the pledges out.

The Hollywood Knights (HK), in many ways, examines similar issues at a similar time except it departs any semblance of maturity and seriousness.HK touches all the silliness a film can muster yet the cast here pulls it off in a fun way. The situation is this...we're in Beverly Hills, CA. in the mid sixties and Tubby's Drive-In, the local hang out for teens, is closing its doors for good when it closes that night. The members of the gang Hollywood Knights are determined to cram into one night all the pranks and mayhem they can. Their ringleader is Newbomb Turk, played wonderfully by Robert Wuhl long before he created the character of ARLI$$ for HBO.You'll get to see some very notable actors and actresses here. Following in the fine tradition of real Hollywood a movie such as this tends to bring to the public some terrific future talent. Among the people you'll recognize are Michelle Pheiffer, Tony Danza, and Fran Drescher. Danza had already been discovered as a boxer turned cab driver in the great TV series TAXI. Pheiffer is so young and beautiful here that it is easy to see the star potential movie makers saw in her. Drescher, shortly before developing her signature role as The Nanny for TV, plays her role with the same nasal Brooklyn charm that made her endearing to audiences.One final note about HK...some of the scenes are slapstick funny. As in Animal House this movie will have you remembering pranks you tried and moronic silly things you laughed at yet it will take you back, I'm betting, in a good way.

There is nothing pretentious or any deeply layered meanings to be found anywhere in this 90 minute romp about a car club whose favorite hangout is set to close after one last night of mayhem.Car enthusiasts will love the various hot-rods that tear up the streets throughout the film. There is a fair amount of nudity and sexual humor mixed in. The film gets the rest of its laughs from low-brow pranks perpetrated by the gang of record.We see the Knights stuff baked potatoes in the tailpipes of cop cars, kidnap and humiliate and honor student, disrupt a country club dance, and drag race up and down the streets of L.A.. There are two particularly inept cops who seem to be on a personal crusade to kick the crap out of the Knights; Newbomb Turk (Wuhl) in particular. Their superior officer warns them to just take it easy and let them have their fun since this will presumably be the last night the gang will be around. Needless to say, the cops disregard those instructions and we see one confrontation after another between the two camps. There is also plenty of animosity directed toward a waspy neighborhood group that has helped push the Knights' hangout out of business. We also see the trials and tribulations of four new pledges who have to run naked through Watts to get to a radio station to make a personal dedication to the favorite hangout. Overall, there's plenty of funny stuff going on.There are a couple of smaller and more serious subplots. One involves a Knight who spends the evening saying his goodbyes to everyone before leaving for Vietnam the next day. This material is sincere, but it does kind of kill the mood in the midst of all the pranks. Another subplot involves Tony Danza and Michelle Pfeiffer having relationship troubles due to the fact that she wants to be an actress and he's against that for reasons that are never really made all that clear. This plot is also somewhat of a distraction, but it gives us a chance to look at Pfeiffer, and she is absolutely amazing in this film!!! Wow! There is no doubting Robert Wuhl's charisma as Newbomb Turk. I'm surprised it took him as long as it did to make a bigger name for himself in Hollywood, but he's pretty much made it now. Pfeiffer and Danza of course went on to much better things, as did Fran Drescher.Still funny after all these years, The Hollywood Knights is certainly worth a look. But keep in mind that this film is not exactly an episode of Frazier. For those of you looking for intelligent comedy, you won't find it here. This film gets its laughs from lighting bags of dog crap on fire and watching the horrified reactions of wasps after they've just been mooned.It makes me laugh, anyway! 8 of 10 stars.The Hound.

I'd probably watch film footage of Michelle Pfeiffer polishing furniture...and the cars are cool)this film is just way too derivative of the territory mined by George Lucas 7 years previous with American Graffiti and John Landis 2 years previous with Animal House...Mutrux gives nothing new to the formula other than swinging much wider with the smutty style of humor that the passage of a couple of years time has allowed. What pains me is the comments of those who regard this as some sort of masterpiece of comedic nostalgia that puts the aforementioned Lucas/Landis projects to shame ...this film may be a suitable time capsule for your recollections of 1965 as filtered through Porky's-tinted glasses but you folks really need to gain some perspective before you diss Graffiti...George Lucas practically invented the genre that Mutrux is exploiting here...I know cause I remember being a kid in the early 60's and facing Vietnam while leaving high school...and in 1973 Graffiti was such a welcome voyage back to a more secure and innocent past that only two films that year drew a bigger audience...The Sting and The Exorcist and Lucas achieved that with a pittance in funding compared to the other two yet garnered several Academy Award nominations...including Best Picture.And he pretty much invented the use of a period music soundtrack to achieve realism..a technique that has been copied in addition to the use of multiple story lines occurring simultaneously that are both commonplace today.The epilogue ending with the where are they now?character cards was totally original and a real jolt at the time..a sucker punch that fortold of things to come and was effectively stood on its ear by Landis in his closing in Animal House . Graffiti's success ushered in the whole nostalgia craze that set in during the post-Vietnam era...and all the lame exploitations to follow ..such as Happy Days...and this forgettable epic.

It is no more than a meaningless collection of unfunny vignettes that had to have been embarrassing to film for the poor people involved on both sides of the camera. I cannot get over how bad either the writing, or the acting, or (at times) the writing *and* the acting was. To get it out of the way early, every single thing involving the cops was completely unfunny, terribly written, and terribly acted -- every single thing. The terrible writing is not the actors' fault, but the absolutely horrid acting is. Oh, and I forgot to remember to have tears come to my eyes whenever The Serious Moments were spewed across the screen, meaning the dude going to Veet Nam and that incredibly well fleshed-out relationship between the Tony Danza & Michelle Pfeiffer characters. Um, right. I'm running out of brain capacity trying to think of all the other um, right moments...a cheerleader forgets to wear underwear -- um, right...the pledges run across not one but three stereotyped groups of blacks -- um, right...the cops...the kid with the skateboard...the college guy with the pipe...two Asian senior citizens hot-rodding a Cobra...repeat after me um, right.Among the few (hell, the only) who marginally escape the carnage, well, Wuhl showed maturity beyond his (29!) years by clearly recognizing he was saddled with absolute dog schism, but deciding to play it out just like the brass said to, subsequently giving them (and the public) no one to blame but themselves. Meanwhile, The Nanny gave some proof she might eventually be able to act -- might -- but clearly wasn't shrewd enough to play above the material. So aside from her giving the audience a little crotch shot from the back of Newbomb Turk's van, there wasn't much else to go on. Meanwhile, by the time the flick was over, I realized that the only laugh I got -- the ONLY LAUGH I GOT -- was when the poor geek walked balls-first into that concrete pole. OK, maybe that, and the fact that someone would be named Newbomb Turk.Oh, and thank God the DVD comes in widescreen format too, because I would have been disappointed if I had missed something important in the way the director framed some of the shots.Ninety minutes you can never have back.

His characterization in this film as gang leader Newbomb Turk might serve as the Webster-approved definition of dork; loud, hyper, without a trace of self-awareness, and proudly showing the world he's not yet mature enough for sexual experience by being as naughty and sleazy as a bad boy can be!

Pheiffer works at Tubby's, a doomed drive-in that seems like Arnold's in purgatory, while Danza basically hangs out next-door in a garage where he talks to the owner and one of his buddy's who's about to go off to war in Vietnam. since it's 1965 they have to play the irony card and the guy going to Vietnam keeps saying things like Oh, it's not really a war, just congressmen are going over there right now or I'll be okay, there's not even any gunfire. they did this so many times that you can well predict the guy is gonna get killed because... well... we all know that Vietnam was wrong!!!!!! and whoever goes there is surely to DIE - in movies anyhow. the real star of this film - ala john belushi in ANIMAL HOUSE - is Robert Wuhl, the very mediocre standup comic/comic writer/comic actor who is at his best here - and that's not saying much. his buddy's are played by actors that in most movies would be extras, ala Background Artists. i liked seeing Otis Young from the LAST DETAIL (jack nicholson's navy buddy) in a cameo as a catering van driver and also, fran drescher appears and has a pretty good role, and has the same annoying accent (a new york accent in LA?) and a very hot body. the most annoying character is a fat honor student who keeps getting kidnapped by the Knights (Stuart Pankin from FATAL ATTRACTION who resembles a darker haired version of film critic Roger Ebert). the Knights (from Hollywood, hence the title) who are, by the way, a car club (or something), are basically a Delta house on wheels. also, there are two side characters that are very annoying and i dont know why the movie focus' on them so much. one is a pretty yet uptight lady in her forties who's married to the school principle, the other is her lover, a coach or something. these two keep finding times alone to make out and i guess this is showing the hypocricy since the lady is the forerunner of the society people who are closing down the diner Tubby's. and as we all know only crazy beer drinking teens have sex. another side story has four naked white guys running thru the urbuan city of Watts rolling tires, pledging to be Knights, in order to reach a DJ in the heart of the city where the DJ can give a shout-out to the dying Tubby's. these frat guys seem to have a wacky time running naked thru one of the most dangerous citys (and historically so since the riots) in California, and, well... they might be in more danger had this been real life and not a semi-PC (even before political corectness came about in the Clinton era) movie. also there are two cops that are only half funny and who are in the movie a whole lot. the best part in the movie is when the skinnier of the cops starts singing actual lyrics to the theme of LAWRENCE OF ARABIA He's Lawrence... Lawrence of Arabia... and so on. it sounds like Bill Murray doing his lounge singer routine in the original SNL. there are very many stale jokes in this semi-cult flick that i think robert wuhl might've stolen from a crackerjack box, that is, they seemed adlibbed by the tubby comic. the music, like this movies daddy, AMERICAN GRAFFITI, is what is playing on all the car radios, is pretty good - but not as classic a selection as Lucas' masterpeice had. also there are shots from the inside of the cars and drag races. what is original is that they dragrace two asian guys - this was borrowed and used in BETTER OFF DEAD a few years later. HOLLYWOOD KNIGHTS is to AMERICAN GRAFFITI what BATTLESTAR GALACTICA was to STAR WARS. that is, it's good fun, has somewhat memorable characters, is full cheap and lame diolouge and action, and is a good enough way to waste 2 hours of a lonesome, boring night... "},{"Title":"Terrible combo of American Graffiti and Animal House","Date":"8 May 2008","Score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" This takes place in Hollywood on Halloween night in 1965. A popular teen hangout is being closed down. The main group there--the Hollywood Knights--decide to see it close down with a bang by playing stupid, unfunny and tasteless jokes on the adults and cops (all of whom are portrayed as total idiots). There's also two serious stories about a Knight going off to Vietnam and two lovers (Tony Danza and Michelle Pfeiffer) whose relationship is falling apart.There's nothing wrong with crude humor. I'm no fan of Animal House but it did have its moments. This however has none. All the jokes are just really stupid, crude and not even remotely funny. I didn't even crack a smile once! The dramatic scenes (there aren't many) aren't any better. They're badly written, directed and acted. It's especially surprising seeing such a talented actress as Pfeiffer giving a truly lousy performance--but the script is against her. Danza doesn't fare much better. The film looks cheap, moves in jerks and leaps (it was incredible how ineptly the multiple story lines are handled) and is just boring.The only reason to see this is to see Danza, Pfeiffer, Robert Wuhl and Fran Drescher all so young and before they hit it big. Drescher is lots of fun especially. Also there's a GREAT soundtrack of oldies. But, all in all, this is just moronic and forgettable. However this inexplicably has a following. Use your own judgment.

Yeah, the actors don't look like they're in High School, but so what. It's crude, has virtually no plot, with the hero's outwitting the dim-witted cops time after time, but it's still a great way to spend some time looking at cars, hearing some great music and having fun. I rate this a six because some of the jokes fall flat, and the plot is very weak. If you want a coming of age movie, American Graffiti is better.I must say that Michelle Pfeiffer in this movie has never looked better. OMG she is so hot. You can just tell that this woman was going to be a star. She was around 22 years of age at the time of this movie. She has a bit part in the movie, but her attractiveness just jumps off of the screen. She appears in a car-hops outfit, but again wow, wow, wow. I don't remember if I saw this in the theater, but I do remember thinking the first time I saw this movie that this girl was going to be a superstar. If you appreciate just looking at beautiful women, like I do, just rent or buy this movie for her alone.Additional Irony - The Tony Danza character doesn't want Michelle to leave because she's going to be a big star and forget him. Talk about an unintentionally prescient scene. After this movie Pfeiffer did become a star, and Tony Danza became a ... sorta non-star. Kinda makes you think doesn't it. Maybe the writers knew something about the future after all?

I must have watched it 10 times on HBO and in the mid/late 80s and I always regretted never taping it years later because I remembered it was so hilarious, but could never find it in the stores. This was because of some copyright dispute.Well lo and behold the dispute was settled and I recently saw it @ Blockbuster and promptly bought it. I wish I hadn't.What was funny at age 14 was painful now in my 30s. It was so unbelievably bad. I mean, Newbomb Turk plays a senior in high school yet he looks like he is 30. The jokes are silly and not remotely funny. The two cops who I remember being hysterical are just downright not funny.Throughout the whole movie I just kept wondering how Tony Danza and Michelle Pfieffer got roped into this ultra cliché ridden plot. If you have not seen this, do yourself a favor and rent American Graffiti instead - it is a 1000 times better and actually has a plot. If you are into juvenile bathroom humor then rent Hollywood Knights.

There's no actual acting going on and I've heard that there really wasn't a script written, just improvised.It shows.Probably the only two things worth watching in Hollywood Knights are the spiking-the-punch scene and listening to a new version of Volare, one that relies heavily on the character's bean intake and your tolerance for bathroom humor.Welcome to it.
