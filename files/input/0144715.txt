[{"Title":"Can Kate deprogram the deprogrammer?","Date":"15 March 2006","Score":"41 out of 56 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Comedy","Review":" Kate Winslet plays Ruth Barron, a young Australian woman who goes to India and becomes smitten with the touch of a charismatic guru, so much so that she changes her name and forsakes her family to stay in India and attend to and worship the guru. Her parents become alarmed. Her mother goes to India to trick her into coming back to Australia so that she can be deprogrammed by a professional from the United States that they have hired (P.J. Waters as played by Harvey Keitel).What director Jane Campion does with this once familiar theme is most interesting. She puts the deprogrammer to the test, so to speak, and initiates a struggle of will between the deprogrammer and his young charge. The key scene arrives as Ruth comes naked into P.J.'s arms in order to test his professionalism (and her sexual power). I don't know about you but I think a naked and passionate Kate Winslet would test any man's motivation and make him think twice about what he really wants to do.The psychological idea behind the story is this question, What is the nature of the guru's hold on his flock? Is it spiritual or is it profane? Do the young women who follow him desire him as an alpha male or is it spiritual deliverance they seek? Naturally Ruth believes the latter and the deprogrammer the former. But what is the deprogammer's motivation? Is this just a job for him or does he feel he is helping to free his clients from some kind of mental slavery? Or is he just another sort of phony guru himself? Keitel in black hair and black moustache and devil's mini goatee dressed in black with a menacing look and a lot of physical energy (despite being 60-years-old when this film was released) contrasts sharply with Winslet's youthful beauty and beguiling voluptuousness. Strength of character is something Kate Winslet brings to any role, even including her outstanding performance as Ophelia in Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet (1996), a role that is usually played wiltingly. Here one senses that her strong will and determination are going to be quite a match for the deprogrammer who gives himself three days alone with her to break her attachment to the guru.Two questions One, if he is successful, will that just mean that she has transferred her allegiance from the Indian guru to him? Will it mean that his psychological strength is greater than that of the guru in far-off India? Two, in what respect is such a forced confinement with someone who is in physical control going to lead to a variant of the Stockholm syndrome experienced by some women held hostage, e.g., flight attendants on hijacked planes, and the famous case of Patty Hearst? Will the captive become enamored of her captor? Campion handles this most interesting theme by focusing on the sexual and carnal nature of the relationships. The test of will between P.J. and Ruth becomes a question of Can she seduce him and thereby strip him of his professionalism? The movie is candid about sex and sexuality in a way that emphasizes the power dynamics of sexual relationships. There is some full frontal nudity and the sex scenes are steamy beyond what one usually sees in an R-rated film. (If seeing Kate Winslet naked might offend you, I recommend you close your eyes.) Harvey Keitel did an outstanding job in a very demanding role and was entirely convincing (despite being a little too old for the part); but as usual Kate Winslet completely took over the film with her commanding countenance, her superior acting skills, her great concentration and her mesmerizing charisma. If there is a better, more captivating young actress working today, I don't know who she is.Her role here might be compared with her performance in Hideous Kinky (1998) in which she goes to Morocco to find enlightenment among the Sufis. That is a more charming film, and she is outstanding, but this one gives greater range to her skills.Notable (and watchable!) as a counterpoint to Winslet's Ruth is sexy and sleazy Sophie Lee as Yvonne who is so taken with P.J. that she fairly begs him to make love to her. Also impressive is Julie Hamilton as the woebegone and stumbling mother.Of course I would say see this for Kate Winslet, and if you are a fan, you sure don't want to miss Holy Smoke since it includes one of her best performances; however, what really impressed me is the original and daring conception and direction by Jane Campion who is best known for The Piano (1993), a film that received an Oscar nomination for the best direction and starred Holly Hunter, Harvey Keitel and Sam Neill.So see this for Jane Campion who is not afraid to show human nature in the raw.(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

Fascinating. Flawed. Out of control. Definitely not ordinary. I can use all those expressions to show what I feel about Holy Smoke, but I think they are not enough to express all my mixed feelings about it. This is not an easy film to watch and more difficult than that to review, but I can say that its qualities overcome the majority of its flaws.Holy Smoke is a story about two totally different people. Ruth is a young Australian woman who travels to India and there starts to take part in a cult, getting fascinated with it. Her family starts to get worried about that and contracts PJ Waters, the other face of the coin, to make Ruth forgets her new beliefs and return to a normal life. They will spent some very unusual days in a hut on the desert, where we don't know who is in charge of the situation. Jane Campion writes and directs this weird and tense story with a wonderful passion. She tries to escape from all the clich√©s and succeeds in. There are some other stories of Ruth's weird family her gay brother, her nymphomaniac sister-in-law, her ingenuous mother. This is the humorous part of the film, where you'll see even a sheep serving as a table at Ruth's house. But, strangely, Holy Smoke didn't feel as a dramatic comedy. It's one of those pictures that you can't define the genre with sure.All the qualities and flaws of Holy Smoke come from the directing and the writing. There are some slow moments, exaggerated situations, some out of places scenes which could have been easily deleted. These are the main reasons why I didn't enjoy very much Jane Campion's earlier works the overrated The Piano and the tasteless The Portrait of a Lady. But here the flaws sometimes can be forgotten because Campion explains the story better than in her other works and succeeds in captivating the audience with an interesting story, discussing subjects as sex and religion with the right tone. The one who really shines here is Kate Winslet. Harvey Keitel is great as always, but Ms. Winslet gives us an Oscar caliber performance. She doesn't have problem in appearing naked, sing, dress Keitel with a red dress and say what she thinks. I'm sure that her performance won't disappear in smoke, at least for me.Holy Smoke was very criticized and snubbed, but it deserves a second chance. I agree that it is flawed and obviously not for everyone. But watch it with patience, pay attention at the subliminal messages, have some fun and think a little. It is worth the price of the ticket.

That hasn't changed. The Campion sisters have written a clever, funny and subtle story of how badly a family can bungle their response when their religion of choice is passed over by one of their own in favour of something they find a little too exotic and scary.It has discreet moments of parody for observant viewers that shows up the shallowness of valuing one faith tradition over another. On the surface it's a hugely funny portrait of a hypocritical conservative family's farcical efforts to  cling to normality when Winslet's character begins to branch out.Look below the surface of the superb performances (especially Winslet and Keitel) and there are some wry observations about religious bigotry and parental disrespect. Winslet and Keitel bring their usual innate honesty and chutzpah to their roles, creating an intense sexual chemistry that is always under their total control.While Winslet's is by far the most accurate Australian accent I've heard from a British actor, watch out for Sophie Lee, a very funny genuine article who I hope we'll see again soon. My only criticism is that Pam Grier was not allowed more involvement. I would have liked to have see her role developed far more.Jane Campion's direction is refreshing as always. She gives us the intense, beautiful harshness of the vast Australian outback as well as zooming in on each character's frailties.This film seems to have polarised opinions for some reason. Perhaps the subject matter has touched a few nerves or maybe some people have expected a different film. Go with an open mind and you may see the power and subtleties of this film.

I am surprised at the negative response so many have claiming that it is anti-feminist blah blah blah or that it is a comedy with no substance. On the contrary, I find 'Holy Smoke' to be a provocative piece full of substance.The refreshing novel concept is pretty daring and Campion balances both dark humour and intensity. She tackles various relevant themes such as respect and care within the family (the mother is the only one who seems to be concerned about what happened to her daughter in India while the father is totally indifferent), sexual manipulation, spirituality vs brainwash, power control and so on. The viewer is totally absorbed on how the de-programmer 'saves' Ruth but things take unexpected turns and we start questioning who exactly this PJ Waters is. The relationship between PJ and Ruth gradually becomes reminiscent of that between Lolita and Humbert (from Kubrick's 'Lolita'). The dysfunctional family is portrayed in a funny light but the characters's (especially the women's) despair and struggle is evident such as Mom being concerned about her daughter and Yvonne who is unhappy with her sex life. Campion, with the help of the actors, creates this whole mysterious atmosphere through the characters. We are given some nice glimpses of the isolated dry Australian landscape.The performances are terrific. Kate Winslet, even though occasionally switches back to her own British accent, acts phenomenally. She already made a brave choice by choosing such a risky role and the actress just shows how comfortable she is in the skin of her character and mesmerizes the viewer. Harvey Keitel does nothing short of a fine job but he is obviously overshadowed by Winslet. The supporting cast, especially Sophie Lee (as Ruth's desperate and sleazy sister-in-law) and Julie Hamilton (as the concerned and loving mother).'Holy Smoke' is a well-made and brave film. Clearly it is not for everyone. There are very few movies that are both funny and thought-provoking. 'Holy Smoke' is one such captivating film.

But though those themes are thought provoking, the movie itself lacks a lot as a movie. I cannot help thinking that someone could have made this into a much better movie (shouldn't be the fault of the makers though, many of them have had good artistic achievements).The persons lack enough depth. The truly complicated nature of people is not - after all - portraited realistically enough in this movie. Because of that you never start to take the movie seriously enough despite the many dead serious themes dealt with.Very difficult movie to rate. In purely artistic sense, the movie acting, directing, filming etc. is worth maybe 6/10, but because of the important thought provoking subject, I give it a much better 8/10.

The trailer banks on the promise with which the movie starts, but this promise is completely squandered.  If it hadn't left me feeling that so much was wasted (including my expectations and time) then I would score it a little higher, but it is a let-down.I got geared up for a satisfying battle of the wills with strong sexual tension and witty comedy - uh, no.  All the hopes you might have for this, entwined with the interesting topics of spiritual belief, family-love, -expectations and -narrowness, and cult deprogramming will be lost quickly. The characters RUSH into sex, and any real interesting issues are suddenly discarded.  It just becomes a drawn out mess with 2 lost people clawing at each other and calling each other names.  An older man becoming obsessed with a nubile young woman (for some reason she spends an awful lot of time hanging around in a bra) who taunts him with it.  Where is his strength? We are supposed to believe that he has worked with 189 other vulnerable young people and his experience leads him to this pathetic breakdown of trust and decency so quickly?  And what about the devotion she had for her belief? Gone.  This could all be the source of a good dark film, if it was handled and explored well, but it isn't here, and this film doesn't make a good transition to it as a subject.  It just left me feeling a bit lost and abused, having watched people being so rotten to one another to no good end (the wrap-up we're OK now, and better for the experience ending is just bogus).  I got the sense that the filmmakers ran out of steam on this - that there were supposed to be many levels at work, but they just couldn't keep it up.  I saw this with two friends and we talked about it for a while afterwards, mainly because we were trying to salvage the unfulfilled promise of interesting topics opened in the beginning of the film.  It left us feeling stranded, needing to talk about it in order to follow through on what the film didn't deliver.  We also needed to just get the bad taste of the film out of our mouths.I see from other viewer comments that people argue that it raises many issues - it does, but that doesn't make it a good film.  It opens too many doors and then let's all the good stuff fly away.  It's a shame, because the first part really seems to be the opening to a view of cult deprogramming, with Ruth's zany family as a background (that bunch of characters is wasted, which is too bad), and then it suddenly becomes about sex, desperation and nastiness, nothing clever.  And the sex isn't even sexy - it's pathetic, desperate sex.  Ick.  Perhaps this movie is worth seeing, for the things that are brought up - but be aware that it doesn't come near to completing the journey with any of them, and that it is not as clever and funny as the trailer and the beginning would lead you to believe.  Be prepared for the characters to fall apart, and to sit through a long period of people being just being mean and debased, until you just don't care about them at all anymore.  All too bad - some very talented people were involved in this.

The film looked promising, a great director, two great lead actors who I respect immensely, and an interesting subject matter. The film quickly went downhill. The entire film is stylistically and structurally disjointed. The director didn't seem to know if she wanted to make the film realistic or not, so she just sort of goes into non-sequitor fantasy sequences at random points in the film, most of which just end up looking silly in an otherwise realistic looking film. The whole thing with Ruth's running off and joining a cult would have created more sympathy for her if there was ever any actual explanation as to what the cult was doing or proof that they were actually dangerous. This was never proved and, in fact, the entire religion actually comes off looking legitimate, especially with the fantasy shot in which the guru touches Ruth's forehead and a third eye opens up in her forehead, which suggests that this guru actually does have spiritual powers, which contradicts the rest of the film.Not that this matters, however, as halfway through the film, the writers decided that the story was no longer about the cult and just made it about this weird sexual relationship between a psychiatrist and his client. Seeing Kate Winslet naked seems to be everyone's favorite part of this film but, as wonderful as that is, it comes out of nowhere and is made ludicrous and disgusting by the fact that she is peeing on herself. And while seeing Harvey Keitel running around in the deserts of Australia wearing a little red dress is certainly entertaining, I really think that, at that point, the audience is laughing AT the film, not with it.Don't believe these people who try to tell you that this movie is over some people's heads.

They're typically representative of common thought - though perhaps more arrogant and more resistant to personal analysis. Like Nietzsche, Jane Campion challenges each of us to self-assess and allows no one to escape scrutiny. By the same token, Campion offers understanding for everyone. HOLY SMOKE doesn't take the superficial road - the good vs evil approach to issues, like the characters in the film do, although I believe it would have enjoyed better critical reception had it done exactly that.The beauty and artistic brilliance by which Campion has dramatized the universal conditions of self-righteousness, hypocrisy and the various justifications to preserve one's comfort of the familiar, is also what I believe caused critics and many viewers discomfort. To me, that very reaction pushes the ironic validity of HOLY SMOKE even further.I had seen Campion's THE PIANO (also featuring Harvey Keitel as the male lead)- a hauntingly beautiful and tragic story of passion that finds its way through the unique gift of a woman and the interest of a man in what she has to give. I was inspired to write a long letter of appreciation and thanks to Jane Campion for her awareness and honesty, her bluntness, her artistry and her guts. Depending on one's point of view, she either empowers or threatens. Her loving treatment of women, who traditionally have been taken for granted - their individual desires, interests and abilities largely disregarded - is evident in her art. But she doesn't stop there. She also shows true compassion and understanding for those whose rigidity and lack of self-awareness cause tragedy.I saw HOLY SMOKE when it first came to theaters and I was mesmerized. Harvey Keitel and Kate Winslet are brave artists who challenge themselves beyond where many would dare to go. From the double meaning of the title HOLY SMOKE (I focused more on the use of religion as a diversionary tool that often clouds reality with smokescreens of piety and righteousness) to the true perversions of our lies (mostly the lies we tell ourselves for comfort), HOLY SMOKE stays right on track. The creativity and individuality we sacrifice (including our own and those of our loved ones) in order to maintain appearances are real. The contortions we go through to become someone else or to escape our own realities with socially acceptable vices (cigarettes, alcohol, bleaching, tanning, etc.), and the desperate acts we perform in order to fit in or to be accepted are exposed within each scene. But we are so used to accepting these things in our every-day lives, it's easy to miss some of the references in the film. Either that, or we are too uncomfortable to admit it for ourselves.So while some viewers/critics stop wanting to think when Ruth Barron (Winslet) urinates on herself (an event that turns the tables on her captor by literally forcing the question of who is in control) - I wonder why people wouldn't be more concerned about the intolerable situation Ruth is faced with. I imagine this scene allows for the dismissal of the film as obscene or over-the-top. But with that I was able to sit up and take note of this woman's inner strength.(An aside I can't help but recall stories of women who prevent rape by defecating during the attempted crime. But how many of us would consider that too rude or impolite, if faced with the same situation? Women are conditioned to accept these things or to blame themselves, but Ruth defies her captor's rules).While some may be put off or confused by witnessing such a macho man as PJ Waters allowing young Ruth to dress him in lipstick and a dress, I find the literate beauty of these scenes as evidence of Campion's insight into the human condition. Not only does the film slowly unveil the hidden realities of PJs state of being and affirm Ruth's strength even when apparently under the control of others, the scenes offer a cathartic effect - especially, perhaps, for women, but also for anyone who struggles to break the mold or challenge the status quo.The notion that macho behavior is really a cover-up for fear of not being manly enough, is creatively expressed in HOLY SMOKE. Campion (through Winslet's powerful portrayal of Ruth and Keitel's gripping characterization of PJ) exposes lies, deceits and the true perversions that come from repression of any challenges to the status quo at all costs.If I were to isolate related theses for HOLY SMOKE, they would be Who defines what is acceptable or not acceptable, and why? What is right and what is wrong? What is womanly and what is manly? If all we have to go on is our own life experience (and we know we struggle with doubts every day in our own lives), can we really decide for others what is best? Yet aren't we also so quick to judge and feel self-righteous about the lives of others - especially those that most challenge our own experiences and understanding? Too often it is easier to criticize and want to control the lives of others than to look inward, critically assessing our own weaknesses and deepest personal fears.I am uncertain about how I feel about the very ending. I like to believe that such a man (or any human) can grow from such experiences, but I think it would be even more likely PJ would have been so defensive of his masculinity that he would have killed himself first. That sense is the only detail that keeps me from giving HOLY SMOKE a perfect score, though I'm sure Campion considered all this, too. I would love to have the discussion with her about her decision! Still, a small issue within a wonderful and brave film.

I was stunned by her use of metaphor in The Piano, a constant returning to the place of origination, the synergy of yin and yang, the veil of illusion, and the mystery of expression (the word).Holy Smoke is more direct in its approach, but effective in exploring themes of power and love as both intimate and universal life forces.  As usual, Campion approaches her subjects with an unflinching, but sympathetic, eye.I am always nearly a fan of Campion's production values  I love the saturated, dark colors, the carefully contrived shots, the whimsical and sparing use of special effects and humor, and typically incredible casting.While appealing on an aesthetic level, what appeals to me most about Holy Smoke is that it deals with some of my favorite themes  the illusory nature of reality, the vulnerability, and power, of the human mind, and heart, and the sometimes shocking, sometimes humorous ways that we learn from the wisdom of the universe.In Holy Smoke, when I saw PJ Waters get off the plane to the sound of Neil Diamond singing I am I said... I am I cried, I took notice, and became expectant of a punch line somewhere down the road.This film could be called flawed, and is definitely not for everyone, but I come away from it feeling empowered, humbled, and amused--and appreciative of the sensitive, creative, adventurous spirits who made it.PJ Waters is retained as an expert to de-program Ruth, but the Universe has other plans in mind... I love it.

There is a clear study in the film, a likable element about it that establishes one thing, develops that and then has the audacity to spin things around onto its head for our own amusement. The film isn't bad as much as it is a little misguided and inconsistent in tone; thus, a tad frustrating by the end. It would have been nice for the film not to have spilt out into a realm of comedy and not get so over-rawed by itself when it relies purely on the image of Harvey Keitel in a dress to get across feeling instead of developing what new level it's attempting to lever up onto.The film is principally a study of the power certain people or 'texts' can have over others, or those of a weaker, more naive, disposition. The one thing the film does tell us is that it can be anybody who falls for the charms or tricks of anybody else, even macho PJ Waters (Keitel) who is supposed to be this ego-driven; ever immune; hard-as-nails; 'never takes no for an answer' and 'nobody puts one over him' caricature. The film's other victim of texts or ideation's that have 'influenced' them to act in artificial ways is a certain Ruth Barron (Winslet), a simplistic and relatively likable Australian girl with a steady life and a family that is very fond of her.PJ exists in the film because of Ruth's inability to deal with the influence a certain Indian guru's image and ideas have on her. Ruth exists in the film to bring PJ into her life and furthermore influence him in both a spiritual and sexual sense. For the best part, the film looks at what affect certain texts and teachings can have on the young and outgoing plus whatever affect those attempting an anti-thesis on these beliefs can further suffer at the hands of their own patient. Unfortunately, the film cannot hold it all together and incorporates elements including, but not limited to slapstick comedy; loose, sexy women as a drive for potential humour; well-known, female global stars in the nude for sake of hearsay as well as well known, male global stars dressed as women for a similar sake.The film begins with Ruth in India. Whilst there, she falls under the influence of a popular Indian guru at the tapping of a forehead and a staring into the eyes. Job done, it would seem. Following this, she becomes trapped in the mindsets and ways of life so much so, that her mother has to fly out in order to 'rescue' her. Ruth doesn't come home initially, but after some banter and some comedy revolving around what a supposed dump really India is, she returns to Oz. Once home, there is a particularly eerie scene in which members of her own family have gathered as one to subdue her, thus refraining her from escaping back to the 'evil' world of India with all their 'evil' influential practises that they do on young, Western women. Could have been worse; they could've conned her into giving away her credit card details as well.Hark, when there's something strange &#x96; and it don't look good, who are you going to call? Why, PJ Waters of course &#x96; a man listed somewhere in the phone-book under 'exorcist', I imagine. PJ is charged with ridding Ruth of these Hindu beliefs. I didn't think it would be so easy, otherwise we wouldn't have had a film, would we? I was expecting it to bed down and become a struggle of sexual politics as this gum chewing, snake skin boot wearing, shades wearing person, who's given all the build up he needs, went up against this young woman out to discover herself in the big, wide world. I was expecting a study of identities, a look at the role of one's self in contemporary Australia and how the Indian 'beliefs' perhaps elevated her to a new spiritual sense thus helping her see things the way she wanted.What we get is a bizarre passage of events. The 'exorcism' plays out and mutates into a sort of 'patient begins to become object of doctor's desire' relationship between the two that further aids in bringing out PJ Waters' feminine side, so to speak. I found it quite amusing at how female director Jane Campion turns the tables on us; how she presents the female of the piece as weak minded and foolish, while the male is the battle-weary, intellectual individual out to 'correct' the female before mixing it all up and turning it on its head. Alas, on the whole, Campion is more interested in shooting Winslet in an array of skimpy outfits (before Kietel gets a chance of his own); she is more interested in a young boy dressed as Batman jumping off a car roof and smacking into the ground as a guardian fails to catch him; she is more interested in the flirtatious attitudes of Yvone (Lee) to act as humour and when lines like I'm sorry Ruth, I should never have slept with you. from PJ evoke guffaws more than anything else, you sort of realise things are not all well.There were some things I liked about Holy Smoke, but they aren't focused on enough for me to recommend it. Once Ruth becomes PJ's object of desire following a bizarre scene in a night club, the film falls apart somewhat and just becomes a slightly unconventional love story with very un-cinematic, and un-likable in equal measure, words like 'quirky' and 'kooky' being able to be attributed to it. The premise has been solved, we're heading off in new directions and the whole thing just fizzles out in a misery-strewn manner. Not a disaster, but not focused and even enough to be fond of.

Sure Kinky is solely set in the 70s in Morocco and Smoke goes back and forth between a teeming India and a desolate Australian outback, but overall the parallels are too uncanny to be ignored. Both feature the beautiful Winslet in beautiful foreign locales seeking enlightenment and mostly getting dicked around by those who claim to be out to help her. Of the two Hideous is holier and Smoke is kinkier. Holy Smoke is also the far better film, focusing on the intensely emotional, often depraved, deprogramming of a young woman who joins an indian cult (Winslet)and the ultimate unraveling of her exit counselor (Keitel). Though the film does a decent job of documenting a deprogramming session, in typical Jane Campion fashion (she wrote and directed) the film also invests a good deal of energy delving into the sexual politics and is ultimately about a lot more than even that. Thanks to Campion's painterly eye, the visuals are occasionally stunning and the female acting is top notch. Keitel, who did such an arresting job in Campion's 1993 film The Piano, is volcanic here as well. And like The Piano his penis also makes a cameo. (Speaking of which, the ever ravishing Winslet herself spends a good deal of time in the bush, if you --wink,wink--get my meaning.) All of which is fun to jabber about with your movie geek friends but this movie is worth more than its extended nude scenes, much more. It serves as as good a social dissection as Campion's early film, Sweetie, invests a lot of honest energy into the true power in sexual politics, examines issues of faith and belief,and stares into the nexus between sex and mysticism to find the two are closer than most of us think. "},{"Title":"Post-'prestige', a partially successful return to SWEETIEland.(possible spoiler)","Date":"17 April 2000","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Comedy","Review":"  In a Shakespeare play like 'A Midsummer Night's Dream', the seeming order of the ruling caste hides a hotbed of anxieties, sexual, social, identity etc.  To work these problems out, the action is moved away from the ruling centre to a nearby green space, a forest for example, where these anxieties and repressions are allowed to play themselves out before order is healthily restored.Jane Campion in HOLY SMOKE uses this model, but there is no normality, health or restoration here.  Ruth and PJ play out their psychodrama in the outback away from the bourgeois normality that is desperate to reassert itself.  Because Judy's great crime is not the joining of a loony cult, but the fact that she has run away, she has made her own choice, she has refused the hypocritical grind of conventional domesticity and marriage, in favour of a more liberating connection.It is not really the point that this is quaintly old-fashioned material, or that Judy's cult IS loony, that its appropriation of Hindu authority is gleeful kitsch, that the 'guru''s intentions may be less than spiritual, that Campion films the Indian sequence, as with much else in this deceptively 'serious' film, with surreal flippancy.  The fact is that Judy's transgression is contrasted with the 'normality' of her home life, a life based on mendacity, adultery, sickness, idiocy, and, worst of all, a repressive conformity verging on the fascist (or cult-like), made even more frightening in that the grotesques surrounding her seem so loveably stupid.Campion's method in the film seems to be to wear everyone down, to strip everyone of illusion, faith, pride, pretension.  This is how the struggle between Judy and PJ plays.  In one way it's a LAST TANGO IN PARIS-exercise in sexual nihilism.  Out in the wilderness, in the 'cave' as PJ calls it, stripped of inessentials, both characters engage in a gladiatorial conflict, removing all conventions and defences, until they are bloody and beaten, they are not longer the selves they have created for themselves.No one wins, we are brought to the beginning, we are allowed start again.  Judy goes back to India, where she began the movie, PJ abandons his lecherous ways to become a partner, father (and after the families we've seen, this is hardly a victory) and novelist. The 'normal' family are in a sense rent too the father finally leaves with his mistress, the mother goes to renew herself in India with Judy, the sister has already cheated on her doltish husband.Can it really be this simple?  The mind/sex games seem to take place according to very violent S&M principles, and the sexual undercurrent bursts into role-play, gender fluidity and humiliation.  But is there a real counter to the violence inflicted on Judy?  The horrifying scene where she is corralled by her male 'family' is continued by PJ's games, and the attempted rape in the nightclub.  PJ as a bullying agent of male domination deserves to be cut down to size, but what did Judy do to deserve her punishment?  The whiff of female masochism running throughout is possibly suspect - we expect it of Harvey at this stage, but can women only experience freedom through degradation, or is this just a 'comment' on how liberated women really are today?The difficulties (and ultimate pleasure) of the film lies, you see, in its wavering tone.  Although the film copies Wong Kar-Wai's fluid subjective style on occasion in its use of colour and editing, there is an oppressive theatricality as you would expect with a conflict between two protagonists in a fixed set.  And while the film concerns some very fundamental traumas, there is a vein of absurd humour that Campion seemed to have lost in her previous prestige costume dramas, but that is gloriously in evidence here, slapstick, unexpected, silly, crude, surreal, wonderful.This fluidity of forms, of tones, mirrors the identity and gender issues the film raises.  Campion's sense of landscape, authentic and in awe, yet laced with both heightened camp and Hollywood melodrama, is unique, further charged in that this mythic Australian space is being contested by Anglo-Americans, as well as Woman and Man.  In spite of some flaws - pacing in the second half especially - this is much better than the reviews have been claiming.

The family brings in a deprogrammer (Harvey Keitel) who is a specialist at breaking young woman who have fallen under the spell of cult members. I can't say this is a totally winning film but it did keep me entertained from start to finish and just when you thought it couldn't get any stranger it certainly does in its second half. This film really isn't about cults but instead the struggles between men and women. The first film has Keitel pulling his magic on Winslet who, in the second half, gets her revenge by putting her hooks into him. Whereas the first film has some sort of religious undertone the second half is a weird sexual journey, which includes Winslet in a full nudity scene, one with her kissing a woman and we even get to see Keitel in a dress walking around a desert in one boot. I'm really not sure what the film is trying to say or if its even trying to say anything at all. Campion is best known for The Piano, which also had Keitel but that film seems normal compared to this one. I've heard people call this a feminist movie, which might be correct but again the ending would lead you to believe this isn't correct. The movie is all over the map in terms of what it's trying to say and do so I guess it's going to be up to the viewer to try and make up their own mind. I'm sure many people will find the film slow and boring but the pacing is what dragged me into the movie and got me caught up with the characters. I think fans of Keitel and Winslet will be the ones walking away entertained because both give great performances and really work well together.

Although the plot has potential, the movie has the maturity of a 7th grader making farting sounds under his armpit. If only the movie was animated, it would be a perfect Simpsons satire of the stereotypical bad movie.Another major problem with the film is that it tries to mix humor with seriously sad problems. Imagine the success of a comedy based on 9/11 and you get the picture. Obvious attempts at humor completely fail in canned, painfully predictable sequences directed with the subtlety of a mack truck. Add to this the fact that the director clearly cannot differentiate between what to shoot and what not to shoot.Other various problems were the irrelevant and distracting Neil Diamond soundtrack, the irritating, obstructed camera shots somehow meant to be creative I guess, and the token gay characters who have nothing to do with the plot. Although the movie supposedly took place in Australia, only one person actually had an Australian accent, the rest of them being vaguely British which is confusing during the entire story. The movie culminates in a transsexual, surrealistic fantasia which can only be described as the work of a deviant, hallucinating pervert.If nothing else, this film realistically demonstrates why you would never want to go to India.

Worried, Ruth's parents hire P.J Waters (Harvey Keitel), an American exit counsellor and cult expert. Waters isolates Ruth in a remote cabin and successfully deprograms her.The film's another of Campion's feminist parables. Burnt by several relationships with men, resentful of her father's infidelities and tired of being sexually objectified, Ruth runs away and latches onto a religious guru. This guru, she believes, wants nothing from her. The reality is that the guru's cult is as exploitative, patriarchal and demanding as the outside world, but Ruth doesn't see this. Her blinders are up, denial is sweet and she wholeheartedly believes that the cult does nothing but profess and practise absolute, unconditional love.Waters, meanwhile, is everything Ruth finds abhorrent. He's a man's man, Campion painting him as a figure of masculine excess, with cowboy boots, a cocksure swagger and a bucket full of charm. Ruth thinks he's the devil, speaking in forked tongues and sent by Satan to steal her away from God's sweet embrace. When the duo consign themselves to a cabin in the wilderness, a bizarre battle of the sexes then begins. Waters breaks Ruth down, rebuilds her into a good, docile, obedient little woman and has sex with her. He conforms to Ruth's caricatural vision of men; men want nothing but control, to deny a woman's desires. Ruth then fights back. She belittles Waters, attacks his age, his masculinity, undermines his machismo, and goes so far as to dress him up in lipstick, mascara, high-heels and a dress. When the battle's over, women have been masculinzied, men feminized, a free-for-all in which gender codes are now ripe for appropriation by all. Waters is humbled and Ruth likewise, the latter learning that men can genuinely love, genuinely be hurt (Waters was sexually abused by a man), genuinely care and genuinely protect. Waters then writes the words be kind on Ruth's forehead, encapsulating the film's final, quasi-religious message transcend gender stereotypes and love all. The film then ends with both Ruth and Waters becoming rounded, 21st century post-feminists. He's married to blaxploitation actress Pam Grier, symbolically chosen by Campion to represent Waters' relinguishing of control (he's now both breadwinner and stay at home house wife, a baby strapped to his chest), whilst Ruth's returned to India to do good work for a charity (with a new man whom she's allowed to get close).The film's very much a prequel to Campion's underrated In The Cut. Its plot is rather original, and it sports exquisite cinematography by Dion Beebe (Collaeral, Miami Vice, In The Cut). Unfortunately the film also frequently missteps with moments of humour (better to treat the material as straight drama), is preoccupied with gender issues which are virtually meaningless when ripped free from the context of class, power and economics, and its treatment of new religious movements and exit counselling will no doubt offend persons knowledgeable of these fields (exit counsellors aren't remotely like Waters, would never do anything he does here). The film also wastes the opportunity to explore a far more interesting theme; when you deprogram a subject, what do you substitute in the absence of religion? Is it ethical to substitute anything? This is a spiritual as well as political problem. Indeed, many ex cult members, when deprogrammed, lapse into depression and self-destruction, unlike Ruth, who recovers immediately.8/10 &#x96; Interesting idea, undermined by some moments of comedy and some obvious, on-the-nose writing.

I will say right out that the movie is well worth seeing. It is interesting and engaging. The two stars, Kate Winslet and Harvey Keitel are both excellent actors, and they have some challenging material to work with. Some stars are lovely to watch. They radiate a presence that is engaging and enjoyable. Their acting skills may be limited but we always enjoy seeing them. Others are good at their craft, excellent actors who can create a mood and scene and a believability that draws you into the film. Then there are a few that have both the charisma and the skill. When that happens they can take just about any script and make it interesting. Both these actors are in that category.As you may have guessed the problem with the film is the script. Not so much the actual dialog, which is good, but the plotting and character development. Due to the skill of the stars you may not even notice flaws, but then again you might. It may be that the writer/director simply took on more than she could handle. Although it would have been a bit dull and predictable, the movie would have worked quite well as a simple movie about deprogramming a girl who got taken up in a cult in India. However, the writer/director wanted to go beyond that. We all have our addictions. Sometimes it's a substance but more often it is an emotion, or a certain kind of thrill, self pity, a desire for power and dominance. I call these kind of addictions character addictions. We all have darker things in our soul that we try to wrestle with. Deep seated desires and flaws. When people get caught up in a cult or a substance addiction it is usually an effort to handle or exploit these character addictions and character flaws. In the film the writer director attempts to explore this darker side of addiction, and in doing so delves into the emotions, desires and drives that we all have which we desperately try to manage and cover up. What starts out as a Macho American trying to deprogram a sexy but foolish Australian girl turns into a soul searching, and at times terrifying exploration of the darker side of both of these people.Oh, if only Jane Campion, the writer/director, had been able to pull it off. However, she doesn't. As the characters descend into their darker thoughts and emotions the steps are abrupt and unconvincing. Kate seems to go from having some doubts, to grief, to insanity and voracious sexual desire - all in a flash with no real convincing turning points. Harvey, who knows he stepping into very dangerous territory and has had enough experience not to resist it, suddenly succumbs. We don't really see the reasons for this in his previous behavior.Despite all this and other plotting issues, the movie does work, mainly due to the skill and charisma of the stars. I give Jane Campion a 10 for wanting to go beyond the ordinary, but a 3 for not realizing it was inadequate. The stars get 10's. The supporting cast gets about a 4. They are meant to be comic relief but come off as too silly for real life. The exception is Julie Hamilton as mum. She perfectly plays a deeply loving mother who, if not very bright, has a heart as big as the world, and would do anything, and give anything for her child.Enjoyable, even if it is a bit confused and disturbing; a must see if you like these stars.

Its difficult to believe a man who has allegedly deprogrammed 189 previous 'clients', then suddenly ends up in Australia without his girlfriend and drops his pants for anything female, including the girl he's being paid $10K to help.  This movie could have worked, but its slow and ponderous right up until the sexual congress convenes, and then it only becomes more preposterous.  I'm not sure what sort of strange demons Jane Campion has in her closet, but they aren't doing a very good job of guiding her art.  Just like The Piano, this movie completely lost me and comes off as some sort of indecipherable post-feminist statement.  The supporting cast is awful, which might not be their fault, but the fact that they are all cast as wooden, emotionally immature, alcoholic Australians.  If I were from down-under, I'd be offended by the stereotypical portrayals.  The end of the movie goes from rediculous to nice and tidy with a pretty bow on top...very weak.  Essentially, this movie is a vehicle to get Kate Winslet naked and Harvey Kietel in a dress, so its probably not going to do too badly at the box office.

One day they meet with those who do not believe in reason but only in hypnosis and meditation. But do not think these manipulators are the criminals. They are just revealing that the subconscious or the unconscious can take over and become the central axle of our psyche, not because we would be losing our minds but because it IS the central axle of the human psyche. Twenty centuries of Christianity, on the western side, more generally thirty centuries of Semitic religion on the Jewish, Christian and Moslem sides have shifted our psyche from the natural central axle to re-center it onto what we call consciousness, reason and logic. We have just repressed the rest under the name of unconscious and subconscious, even the ID of Sigmund Doctor Freud. It is obvious to anyone who has some sense that all other traditions that are five or ten thousand old are more human than our short lived one (or ones) but we don't know. We have forgotten how the basic and fundamental element of our Semitic traditions, the famous Genesis is the total and systematic rejection of the previous principles to replace them with a new one, the vision of the sole God and his spirit creating everything from nothing. When we can meet with the older tradition we get berserk, mesmerized and even hypnotized and we accuse that other tradition to manipulate our minds though we have willfully castrated and destroyed the deeper side of our awareness of life. This film is nothing but the revelation of the depth of this western alienation and self-amputation and at the same time the absolute impossibility to let go with our artificial beings and enter the meditation that would make us merge with the living force of the universe and not the survival instinct of our mechanized, scientized and technologized petty umbilical enjoyment of the city ghettos in which we live. Out worse invention was Scientology that turns this artificial life and thinking of ours front side back by grafting the mental depth of Asian philosophy onto the antagonistic existentialism of psychoanalysis. Mark my word. The Chinese and the Indians right now, and some others along with them, are doing just the reverse and they will take over the world because they will still be rotating around the real axle of humanity and life, the mental force as opposed to reason and logic. We will understand that and react when it will be too late because we cannot cope with the idea that we had had it all wrong all along and that the real stuff is still alive in Asia and is coming of age after a long hibernation. That is not going to be Good Morning Vietnam but both Good Night Western Hemisphere and Good Morning Far East of the Rising Sun. The film is trying to make us believe we still have a chance. It is full of beans. We don't even have one tenth of a chance. We are looking in the west for the generation of leaders who are going to bring us to that consciousness If we are lucky the USA will choose the right man in November, not the one who knows how to win wars, but the one who believes in change, not because he is going to bring that change, but because he will have to be able to welcome the change that is coming all by itself.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines "},{"Title":"Excellent and eccentric, revealing and surprising","Date":"2 May 2005","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Comedy","Review":" A peculiar movie. I loved The Piano and Campion and both Harvey Keitel and Kate Winslet are excellent actors so I thought this would be good. It begins as the predictable story of a young girl (K.W.) who is overcome by a holiness she finds in India and joins an ashram, a devotee to her guru. Her parents are aghast and hire a deprogrammer (H.K.).Her family lures her back to Australia and break her down to agree to spend three days with H.K. He is a quirky character, a caricature more than a real man who thinks he is at the top of his game because he has been so successful deprogramming others. What he has not come up against before is someone so filled with authentic courage and honesty.He manages to break her spell but in the process, she managed to break his shell. The story twists and it is not a story about her. It is a tale of redemption about a faithless, aging, shallow man who comes to see himself as he really is. He is shattered initially, and desperate, assuming he has fallen in love with Winslet. But she is really only a projection of the goddess within that he is beginning to touch.Winslet has an over-the-top family in the background. I can only figure they are the juxtaposition of what society would call normal, compared to the two central characters who struggle for their souls. I don't know why this particular background was chosen. I thought it was absurd and did not aid the film.Winslet is wonderful but Keitel is magnificent.

But the whole thing seems to me SLACK.  The directing is slack, the acting is slack (expecially Keitel), and thus, the whole movie is just slack -- meaning kind of directionless.

The closest I can come is AWAKENINGS (Robin Williams, De Niro) about people coming out a virtual coma, under the chemical ministrations of Dr. Williams.  AWAKENINGS I found excellent.  But maybe it's not close enough to HOLY SMOKE to really be a fair comparison.One problem with HOLY SMOKE is that I was unable to detect any deprogramming expertise on the part of supposedly the world's greatest deprogrammer.

Where there are indeed many parts of the story that border on funny and is sometimes even thought-provoking, the overall feel of this movie is as arid as the Outback.

Fearing that she has been cult-napped into marrying a wrinkly guru, her family hires P.J. Waters (Harvey Keitel), a US hotshot who specialises in the &#145;de-programming' of brainwashed hippies, to bring her back.The performances are brilliantly enjoyable, Kate Winslet is great as Ruth, you can see she is trying a selection of different characters, while Harvey Keitel is at his best as P.J. Waters. Pam Grier is unfortunately underused in Holy Smoke, but the scenes she has are very enjoyable to watch. Anna Campion and Jane Campion's script is very well thought-out and extremely interesting, while Jane puts in lots of effort in directing, although sometimes she overdoes with different camera angles, making some of the shots very hard to watch and slightly confusing.

For film to be good, it has to place me where I would not go, and change me. This time, I was swept up in this seemingly simple drama the wilds, unknown motives, undirected ideals, misplaced trust. The images were unique, and the acting superb. I saw Kate in Hamlet and wondered if this was the same woman I had seen in Titanic. Her Ophelia, a challenge for anyone, was delicately layered. I'll be interested in watching her grow. Somewhat gratifying to see someone without a Barbie figure being sexy.What worries me is how Campion had to make the whole rest of the world comically surreal in order to focus on her duo. She controls this part, and then lets the central drama run wild. I think she really was beyond her limits with this central drama, but that's what makes it genuine. Portrait of a Lady suffered from too much control --  here she shifts that control to the ludicrous aussie family, and lets the central drama roam.Kate understands that she is not acting a character, but a belief system, or rather a belief in belief systems. We saw that in Ophelia and I'm sure that's why she was picked here. Keitel's defeat is an exposure of Christianity. But poor Harvey is a plain old (excellent) actor who just becomes his character. I'm sure he had no understanding that he was to symbolize something, and so while he connects with Winslow, he doesn't with Campion's vision.Some symbols were unwelcome by me, because they were so deliberately placed the pee, the reindeer-car, the koala bear...So a little out of control, tarted up with post-feminist pretentiousness, and one of the performances excellent, but a near miss.

But because it features two of the best actors around giving some of the bravest acting that I have seen this is a movie that is hard to hate.Kate Winslet stars as Ruth, an Australian woman who went to India and fell under the spell of a cult guru. To illustrate the spell of the cult there is a wonderful scene the guru places a jewel on her forehead and it turns into a third eye. Ruth's family wants to pull her away from the cult and hires 'cult exiter' P.J. Waters (Harvey Keitel) to bring her to her senses. They fake a family illness to trick her into returning home where Waters takes her to a shack in the middle of nowhere to begin her program of deprogramming.After some quiet moments in which the two engage in a truly fascinating conversation about the meaning of beliefs the movie begins to lose it's way. I thought that this would be a movie about how P.J. uses his experience to break her down and how Ruth puts up the wall of her beliefs as a defense but it doesn't go that way.Waters begins to fall under Ruth's spell mentally and sexually. I could have handled that but it happens so quickly that there never seems to be any kind of power struggle. We are told that this is Keitel's 190th case but I was left to wonder how a man could be successful in 189 cases of deprogramming and fall for this young woman after only two days. The way Ruth brings P.J. under his spell its a wonder the guru didn't fall for her.Much as I hated the end of the movie I cannot dismiss it all together. Winslet and Keitel both give performances that are electrifying. Their sexual chemistry together had me longing for a better story, perhaps these two as an adulterous couple.Keitel has always been a risky actor, taking roles like 'Bad Lieutenant' that many actors would touch with a ten-foot pole. Kate Winslet is taking same track. She hasn't let her success in 'Titanic' be her easy ticket to a $10 million paycheck from Hollywood hot air turkeys like 'Charlie's Angels'. She has continued to seek out challenging roles in films like this and 'Hideous Kinky' and 'Quills'.'Holy Smoke!' is directed by Jane Campion and co-written by Campion and her sister Anna.

Keep in mind my set of tastes isn't always entirely rational. While I have a penchant for upsetting, aggressive movies such as Hate and Natural Born Killers, I can also enjoy the subtlety of films like Dead Man or Wings of Desire. More often than not, I am drawn to thought provoking films no matter how much they try my patience or wrench my stomach. But then to spite myself, I'll fall in love with Starship Troopers. Go figure.This month, I turn your attention to the latest drama from Jane Campion, Holy Smoke, starring Kate Winslet (Titanic, Heavenly Creatures) and Harvey Keitel (The Bad Lieutenant, Mean Streets). (Pam Grier (Jackie Brown, Foxy Brown) gets third billing, but don't hold your breath or blink if her name drew you to the movie.) The movie opens in India where the young, beautiful and impressionable Ruth (Kate Winslet) and her Aussie friend are on vacation. Amongst the bustle of an overcrowded, smoke-filled plaza, Ruth notices other white girls dressed in saris, giggling and appearing to fit into these foreign and mystical surroundings.At this point I lost valuable screen time attempting to divine the meaning of the Neil Diamond tune playing over the images of ex-patriot hippies writhing on a rooftop in India, but soon I was pulled back to the rest of the plot's setup Ruth finds herself literally touched by a guru and believes that he has shown her the way to enlightenment. Her family, of course, believes she has been drugged or swindled into the starry notions the guru has fed her. They hire PJ Waters (Harvey Keitel) to rid her of the influence of the alleged cult leader. As PJ trains his will on Ruth to break her of her false mysticism, we are brought into intimate contact with Ruth's unresolved issues from a childhood crying for communication and nurturing.What follows is a well-acted tete-a-tete between the troubled Ruth and PJ's macho American caricature as they explore each other and themselves. This is the meaty section of the film where PJ systematically strips Ruth of her belongings, both physical and mental, that have anything to do with her India experience. In this process, the tables become turned as he is forced to look at himself in the mirror. At the finish line, Ruth's romantic notions are all but dead and PJ winds up in the middle of the desert wearing a dress and red lipstick. Who won the war of the wills? You be the judge.Holy Smoke is written by Jane Campion and her sister Anna and explores issues of a large dysfunctional suburban family and coercive, overbearing father figures. In other words, this is classic Campion. These have been common themes in Jane's previous work in one strain or another, and now her sister is getting in the same bed, if you will. Jane started exploring these issues in the mid 80's in her short films Peel, A Girl's Own Story, and Passionless Moments, and continued the thread with her features Sweetie and The Piano. In Holy Smoke, the Campion sisters dive head-first into the burning cauldron of sexual politics between a young woman searching for meaning and an adult well-entrenched in his beliefs. As in other Campion films, this films attempts to pull into focus the psycho-sexual nature of male-female relationships, especially young women's relationships with father figures. On one level the film seems to say that male domination is arousing, and on the other hand its message seems to be that a little T & A can go a long to making a man submissive. While Campion's themes have a tendency to bewilder, I found Holy Smoke to succeed where some of her other films may have not, largely due to Kate Winslet's character and the strong performances by the rest of the cast, as well as the enchanting, warm cinematography (Dion Beebe) throughout the film.A collection of Campion's shorts are available on the compilation titled (thought-provokingly enough) Jane Campion Shorts. If you find yourself attracted to Jane's present work, I recommend viewing her shorts, especially since it is uncommon to find most filmmaker's early work on tape. By the way, both Peel and The Piano won a Palm d'Or at Cannes, which just so happens to be the biggest gold star a filmmaker can ever receive.With Holy Smoke, Jane Campion has made another interesting piece of cinema. But beware, this is no light fodder. The film covers some fairly heavy territory that could well make you take a second look at yourself and the sordid relationship with your family that you would rather stick in a dark place. Nonetheless, if you would rather lay back and take in the beautiful backdrops of India and Australia, this is a fine film as well.

What begins as a very interesting and involving power struggle between the two lead characters quickly degenerates into farce, an excruciating one at that.  The story ends up lurching from place to place, adding little and lacking impetus.  There are indeed some shocking moments, but they seem to be more intent on the shock value itself rather than further developing the characters or plot.Be warned, there is some horrible, horrible dialogue littered throughout Holy Smoke, delivered in most disappointing, amateurish, stage-y ways (Be kind, yes, be kind! and Man-hater! immediately spring to mind).  The stereotyped Australian characters were so tiresome - think Muriel's Wedding without the humour, depth, charisma or development.  On the positive side, there are some excellent visuals (the Shiva image at end was exquisite).  The photography etc. was beautiful to look at throughout.Kate Winslet did an excellent job of an Australian accent, probably the best I've ever heard from a non-Aussie.  The gorgeous Sophie Lee reprised her Muriel's Wedding-type role with characteristic aplomb, doing the best she could with the supplied dialogue.In conclusion, this movie is worth viewing for the first hour. It's such a shame that the very interesting initial premise was not followed through to a satisfactory conclusion - this film could have been a masterpiece.

I can understand that up to a point, as it lurches disconcertingly at times between serious spiritual  discussion/exploration and slapstick 'strine farce.  I say why the hell not - Jane Campion is a unique film maker and I have so much respect for her that perhaps I give her more leeway than I would many other directors.  Not everything works, for sure, but the film has an almost visceral power at times, and the main ending (ie before the one year later coda) is hugely moving.I can't think of a better performance by Kate Winslet she is totally convincing both as a star-struck spiritual convert (albeit one who continues to smoke for Australia), a headstrong and bolshie virtual prisoner, and a young woman who does find out some truths about herself. She is also completely fearless and heart-stoppingly beautiful (oops, there goes any last vestige of objectivity).Harvey Keitel's part is fiendishly difficult how to portray a man who is deeply narcissistic and a dirty old man (in his words), while still showing at least some of the techniques and skills that an exit counsellor might use.  I'm not sure he pulls it off completely, but - like Kate's performance - it's a bloody brave attempt.I can't recommend this film unreservedly, as you might hate it.  but I can recommend it wholeheartedly, as it is courageous and unique, two attributes that most films nowadays lack.

Unfortunately it's the wrong decision  the narrative very quickly unravels, and the story is thenceforth ridiculous.  Despite that, there's much to admire.  The acting is excellent  Harvey Keitel brings just the right degree of ambiguity and obnoxiousness to his role.  Kate Winslet has never turned in a lame performance and here she is simply radiant.  Both of them inhabit their characters fully -- you truly believe that they truly believe the crap they are spouting, and it makes their psychological battle so much more compelling.  The supporting cast also deserves a mention for being quirky and interesting.  They add a great deal of genuinely warm, yet hokey humor which offsets the seriousness of the roles played by Winslet and Keitel.  Further, the cinematography is beautiful and occasionally breathtaking, and Jane Campion's direction is wonderful.  But (very mild spoiler) she could've spared the world another look at Keitel's naked body. Enough already!Ultimately, I do recommend this picture because of some wonderful moments and images, but also because even as it goes wrong, it still steers very clear of Hollywood cliches.

After each film my first instinct was to go find some comments by the director because I'm really curious about what they were trying to say, but to me that isn't a very good comment on a film, when the piece itself can't speak to me and I spend a good deal of the second half of the film wondering what the director is thinking.I'm about to go into details here, so don't read further unless you've already seen the film or don't careI kept waiting for the shoe to drop, surely after they have sex Ruth will run back to India and the laugh is on PJ, surely this is all a rouge, right?...Nope. Wait, this is all an elaborate plot by PJ to really break her from this guru spell by showing her what it is like to be treated like a guru, and pretty soon shes gonna snap out of it and he'll let her know it was all an act and that he almost always sleeps with his clients...Nope. By the time he punched her I was just thinking this film is messed up and whatever Jane Campion was trying to convey was hopelessly lost.It's a shame because there is some really interesting stuff to cover here power, the nature of happiness, beauty and how damn powerful beauty is. And the first half starts out very promising, get everyone else off the screen and let these two go at it verbally, but by Day Two it began to dawn on me that the writer didn't know where the hell to go with the premise, I didn't see or hear anything that made any sort of break in the Ruth character believable, nothing of real substance was being communicated and PJ getting a blowjob from Yvonne was enough to bring me around to what I think is my current view of the whole filmIt's a very symbolic/semi-absurd look at power between men and women, with a little religious blather thrown in.Taken in that context the whole lipstick and dress scene, not to mention the cross-desert crawl all begin to be a bit more understandable. The only problem is that PJ isn't really much of a person, certainly no match for Ruth and so any potential dialogue of value is just going to be Ruth toying with him until she gets bored of it all...and maybe that is finally the point, if you take Ruth as Women and PJ as Men, the I suppose Jane is trying to say that Women have it all over Men when it comes to real power and they can do with it what they please but they aren't going to get much help from Men in trying to figure it all out, Men are just lusting after physical beauty and not much more, so you're gonna have to figure it out for yourself Woman.There's some truths in that, but as a man I wish Jane would give our gender a bit deeper examination, she always creates these wonderfully interesting and complex female characters while the men sit around and brood over sex or jealousy...there's more to us, or maybe that is something she hasn't discovered yet. And to say in her defence that films for decades have been all about men so its about time that women were given a fair shake is missing my point, there have been mostly films about shallow charcters (true, mostly men) for decades, what we need are more films about deep women and men...heck, we could even see the two together, now that would be rare. "},{"Title":"A Slightly Muddled Tone Threatens To Overwhelm a Mostly Appealing Film","Date":"26 October 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Comedy","Review":"  When Holy Smoke was first released on US shores, the advertising campaign featured a stylized tabloid and the headline, Holy Smoke! The exclamation point was featured in a number of early listings for the film as well. And what difference does that punctuation mark make? Especially since it seems to have vanished completely, especially in the video promotion, which seems to focus on stars Harvey Keitel and Kate Winslet looking either lustful or holy? Well, it clarifies the tone of the film. Going from the tabloid ad, you might think the film was a satire - of religion, of sexuality, of power. From the more recent posters, you might think it was another Jane Campion polemic on, well, religion, sexuality, and power, perhaps as humourless as The Piano. The problem is that the film seems to be teetering to both extremes. 	In earlier Campion films, like Sweetie and Angel at My Table, a strong current of black comedy filled the pieces, even if tragedy was on the surface. Both The Piano and Portrait of A Lady lacked that humour, for the most part. For me, at least. Perhaps, then, Campion can't be blamed for going playing up the slapstick in Holy Smoke. A Fabio lookalike runs into a poll. A silly woman looks away as her child jumps into her arms and the kid falls flat on this face. These gestures get easy laughs from the crowd, but probably undermine the rest of the story. 	Ruth (Winslet) goes to India and joins a religious movement or cult. After her Australian family tricks her back to her native country, they bring in leading deprogrammer Harvey Keitel and a predictable war of wills ensues. All the while, on the outside, Ruth's slightly off-kilter family does silly things for no reason. The battle between Ruth and the deprogrammer intensifies and it becomes inevitable that somebody will break down. 	It makes sense that Winslet's Ruth would see the artificial family of the cult as preferable to her own. Not because her family isn't loving, but because they're so very low culture. If the film is a satire, Campion is making a little joke about the upper blue collar families of Australia. And even though it probably is, Campion is being a little too condescending for my tastes. Too many of the jokes are too obviously at the bumbling family's expense. 	Both of the two leads are excellent. Perhaps too good. Winslet and Keitel may have too much intensity for the humour that Campion's aiming for. Basically, they sell the fact that lives are at stake, even if the writing doesn't. Winslet's Ruth hardly gives any evidence that she's been brainwashed or any any way indoctrinated by her cult,  but from Keitel's urgency, you fell like she's still in danger. And many critics described Winslet's performance as fearless and this is true. The fact that she was denied an Oscar nomination is a little sad. 	I guess what I'm saying, overall, is that if Holy Smoke is a comedy,  it's not quite funny enough. And if it's a drama, it's a little too overbearing in its ideology, something that could have been softened had the message been snuck in between laughs instead of through the committed performances of the leads.	On a technical level, Holy Smoke is beautifully made. The cinematography perfectly balances the dirty realism of Delhi, the sunbaked nature of the Outback, and the fantasies and hallucinations of the main characters. Campion, as always, is a master of place, perfectly situating her actors amidst throngs of people and miles of wasteland.	I'd give Holy Smoke 6/10 I think. I actually liked the film a lot more the second time I saw it (strangely, the first time was on video and the second time in 35mm), so it probably rewards additional viewings...

I guess that, while the performances are great and the direction is very good (it was the first Jane Campion film that didn't make my head fall down on my chin now and then), the story by Campion and her sister Anna is the problem.Ruth is a very pretty, smart young girl who falls under the spell of a guru in India. Her father and mother are determined to talk some sense into her and they hire a exor... excuse me, Cult-deprogrammer. Reluctantly, Ruth allows this man to take her to a desert cabin where she will undergo a three day session.Is Ruth really under the spell of an Indian cult? This girl can't be more regular she smokes, she drinks; goes to parties; drives a car; sings along with pop music; has sex &#150; O, my goodness, what kind of twisted cult did this girl join?! She chants a few times, she lights a candle and has a photo of her guru on her, but hey, Jane and Anna, you can't fool the audiences. This story has nothing to do with religion or philosophy; the use of a cult is just an alibi for another battle of the sexes, and, indeed, that's what we get. Harvey Keitel's self-indulgent character (`183 successful cases') is introduced as a man for all seasons. The scene on the airport says it all he's selfaware, muscular, gallant, but still looks like the slick manager of a cheap back-street boxer. Three days is the standard time for Keitel to wash the cult out of someone's head, but when he lays his eyes upon Ruth, he smiles and remarks `Let's make that twelve hours.' But Keitel is gonna have a hard time with this girl. He tries to get through to her, but she resist and all it takes for Ruth to swap roles and bring Keitel down is to get undressed and have sex with him a couple of times. A female using sex to get what she wants and a man who can't resist a woman offering herself. Wow, Jane and Anna, what a revelation! And while we watch and actually enjoy this film, we do continue to keep asking ourselves questions like Ruth is such an independent, strong woman. How could she possible fall so quickly under the spell of a guru?  And if Keitel is the best in his field, how is it possible that it takes only having sex with Ruth twice to change him from the self-indulgent man we saw at the airport to the beaten, pathetic cross-dressing loser in the end?Like I said in the beginning, I would have paid admission to see this film because it's never boring, it got a healthy sense of humor; it's pretty well made and acted, but in the end, it has nothing to do with cults; this is a rather shallow revisit to Battle Of the Sexes-county.6 out of 10.

What I saw was certainly many layered - a stodgy pudding of so many ingredients that, while still edible, left one confused as to what the heck it was.  I liked the first half of the film, I was confused by the second half.  There certainly must have been smoke of some kind when the script was written - lots of it because the viewer emerges from this experience in a kind of heavy-headed hangover where more questions are asked than answered.  I wish films in Australia would tell a story and forget this daft Priscillaesque montage of quirky characters in outback locations wearing kinky costumes. Yet this is exactly where Campion takes us and throws symbols at us as though there were no tomorrow.  The symbolic references are sometimes so obscure (constant references to red and green for example) or just plain silly (gay men in mardi-gras cowboy outfits).  Kate Winslet tries hard and even gets a good accent going but before you can say meaningful night shot, her clothes are off and she's turning Harvey Keitel into a transvestite.  I loved Julie Hamilton as the mother - nice character, well meaning but she was surrounded by the most useless group of family members that gave nothing to the plot and were, frankly, an embarrassment (why make the brother a gay character?) and another of those quirky Aussie families with no taste and thick as stale bread.  I don't know any outback morons  but they keep cropping up in Australian films.  I would have thought someone as intelligent as Jane Campion would have resisted the stereotypes and the cliche long enough to give us a damn good story.  I did not hate this film; I left confused and bewildered.  A group of women behind me, whooped and applauded and left giggling and in high spirits.  Maybe they saw something I did not.

Ms Winslet marvelously plays a young woman, who thinks to have found fulfillment and truth in her life with a sect in India, hoping that she may be so lucky that she might become wife to sect-leader Baba, who's marrying everybody, transferring his transcendental love on all.Her family, however, think otherwise and feel she has been ensnared by some weird cult.

The book was enjoyable enough to read, although there are some places where there is a certain lack of style, making you occasionally wonder why such a book was written.However, from seeing the movie it was fairly obvious the book was mainly written for the film adaptation as a lot of the story's aspects work much better on screen, and so it is consequently much better as a film.From the film's superbly portrayed credits, one can tell that this picture has a certain unique quality absent from mainstream cinema. It begins with a 20-year-old Australian Ruth Barron (Kate Winslet) and her time in India as a member of a religious sect led by a Guru, Baba. Her deeply worried family back in Australia send her mother (Julie Hamilton) to find her in India, only to unsuccessfully attempt to bring her back to Australia under the false news that Ruth's father (Tim Robertson) is ill and dying. The only reason why Ruth returns is due to her mother having a severe asthma attack and her having to be taken back home in medical care on a plane. Once arrived, Ruth begins to settle in to her old family, but only temporarily. Soon she discovers her father's true condition, and that her family simply lured her to Australia in order to banish her from the Indian cult. What's more, the family have payed a large sum of money to a cult de-programmer from the United States called PJ Waters (Harvey Keitel). His plan is to mentally break down Ruth in order for her to lose her faith in the sect. He is given some time alone with her in a hut in the middle of the desert, it's only then when things begin to really get out of hand...Holy Smoke is a darkly comic tale with some great acting, its tragi-comic style working very well. Several aspects of the book are much improved here.The film brings out the more humorous side of the events. The most comic part of the film is Ruth's Australian working class family, hilariously and mercilessly portrayed as ignorant half-wits. Many of the film's dialogue is a lot funnier on film compared to the book because of the crass Australian accent (absent from the book) behind it. This illustrated by one excellent line near the beginning of the film in which a man introduces the idea of de-programming to Ruth's family and in the middle of his speech he talks about how he can wake up and say to himself every morning, I'm fat, mate. Also, Harvey Keitel's cool, relaxed American character PJ Waters contrasts very well with the Australian backdrop, one of my favourite lines of the film being when he wakes up next to Ruth having reluctantly slept with her the previous night. His voice-over heralds the new morning with the words, Day Three.....S***! But not all of the film is comic; indeed, there are some scenes in the picture which are almost harrowing, one of the most memorable scenes being that of Kate Winslet wondering naked across the desert in the middle of the night, totally degraded and brainwashed, eventually urinating in front of the shocked PJ.The film is a picture that simply has to be seen by anyone who has a reasonably good sense of black humour. There are outstanding performances from Keitel and Winslet, and a strong supporting cast, with some good performances from Sophie Lee as Ruth's sister and Pam Grier in her brief appearance as PJ's girlfriend. The soundtrack is also impressive, with a wonderful laid-back style. Overall, the film's blending with pathos and humour makes it very memorable and affective. One to watch!

She's at the point where she has discovered that women, by virtue of their sexuality, can have immense power over men. But she has not apparently noticed that some men are also able to control themselves.The movie looks good and is always interesting, but Campion's thinly disguised contempt for middle-class Aussies turns almost all the characters into the usual cliches favored by the literati. The camera work is powerful, but it is particularly opinionated whenever it shows an exterior in the Outback; whenever people or their possessions and structures are shown against the desert landscape, the human presence looks like a vile intrusion on nature's beauty.Kate Winslet performs very well as the confused and self-absorbed young woman who is the object of the deprogramming efforts of Harvey Keitel. Keitel does his usual thing; a guy with a Brooklyn accent who fights his diction problems in almost every utterance, but is willing to do his best with all the director's instructions.

If a cult leader gives someone the confidence (however unfounded) to go through life with equanimity, then perhaps successfully exiting a cult member involves little more than returning them to their anxieties and neuroses. Of course, most of us would tend to believe that cult members have been brain-washed, whatever that means, because it gives us more reassurance that we have not chosen the wrong course in our own lives. But there's something intrinsically selfish about assuming that if someone says that they have found happiness, but no longer need you, then you are entitled to assume that they are mad.Such thoughts come to mind during the opening section of Jane Campion's film 'Holy Smoke'. Campion, who made the oh-so-serious 'The Piano', has here gone for a lighter tone, more akin to that of her debut movie 'Sweetie', and it's fair to say that it doesn't quite come off the thoughts in the first paragraph of this review were stimulated in part by the film's slightly ramshackle quality, it's characters suggest ideas more than they inspire a faith in themselves as individuals. Kate Winslet plays a young Australian woman who joins a cult in India; Harvey Keitel plays the exit expert called in to de-condition her. Winslet in particular is good fun but the story never wholly works she never seems brainwashed, just a slightly self-important and immature young woman who hasn't yet realised that everything she is feeling has already been felt before; while Keitel gives no convincing impression of a man capable of breaking through even the deepest of adherences. It's traumatic for Winslet to be kidnapped by her family, and indeed, this forces her into some responses which she might have hoped she was now above; but the mechanics of how Keitel starts to break her faith are sketchily portrayed. Perhaps best value (for the viewer) is Winslet's depraved outback family, a good indication of what she has been running away from.So the first half of the movie is entertaining but surprisingly amateurish. But the second half is quite odd. As Keitel starts to make progress, Winslet becomes sexually needy, and manipulative. Her character's underlying motivation (for making advances on Keitel) seems to fluctuate by the minute; while he responds with a complete lack of professionalism. There's meant to be a kind of symmetry here, as the relationship of the two is reversed; but at least in the beginning of the film we have some idea of what the characters are meant to be feeling. The film concludes with some stunning images (Keitel in a red dress in the middle of the desert, for example), but the logical justification seems poor. I found myself growing less and less interested the longer the movie went on. Campion adapted this film from a book by her own sister; very sororial, but on reflection, maybe not such a good idea. Overall, it does just enough to convince you that someone else could make a good film on this theme.

But enough about politics and faith. This review should be about the movie and its subject.This movie could have been really hard to swallow if it had taken it's subject (getting someone out of the hands of a bad religion or a sect) too serious, but thanks to the, sometimes subtle, humor that was used, this movie wasn't too hard. And you can't say that it left out important things either. It showed the concerned but ultra-conservative family, the 'exorcist' who will perform his magic trick and bring back the girl as a good person, but ultimately starts asking questions about his believes himself, how the girl was overwhelmed by the guru, the interesting cat and mouse game between Ruth and her 'exorcist'...The acting was very good. I really enjoyed Harvey Keitel's performance. He was exactly the way I would imagine such an 'exorcist', yet he still surprised me from time to time.

Jane CampionThis is a very strange movie, combining some real ambitions with downright sloppy self indulgence, and while its suspect heart eventually proves to be somewhere near the right place, its disregard for the intelligence and experience of its audience betrays a major directorial miscalculation. The movie is ambitious in its hinting about the possibility that romantic love may not be the only kind worth having, but then self-indulgent in abandoning this more interesting line of speculation for purposes of promoting what seems like a romantic conflict whose chief raison d'etre is that Jane Campion wants to show us how women can (and perhaps should) win the private battles they have with men and be heroic in the bargain.I say self-indulgent because Campion fails to give the female in this conflict (Ruth, played with admirable passion and headstrong grace by Kate Winslet) a real opponent, and the conditions under which they come into conflict are themselves suspect from the moment the troubles start.  Women win these battles all the time, and heroically, and it is long since unnecessary for artists to go out of their way to make this point again for us.  In this, Campion is no better than Spielberg reworking well-worn emotions about the Second World War, and she insults her audience in pretending that we need Campion to make this triumph of womanhood seem possible.  Yet, if this is not her purpose, why make PJ, the cult victim deprogrammer hired by Ruth's family to extricate her psyche from the spell cast by an Indian guru she meets on a coming-of-age trip to India, so weak? He is a strange character, equally given to quoting the Bhagadvad Gita and trailer park banalities about love.  And not only is his talk unbalanced between high and low ambitions, his behavior is too (he is coming to save the psyche of a young woman, but also, judging from his actions once he arrives, happy to mix in the occasional adulterous action when conditions, and his inclinations, coincide).  And he is not convincing as the cult exiter he claims to be.  One begins to wonder how he ever succeeded 189 times before in the 3-day deprogramming process if he can't do better than he does in dealing with Ruth, who clearly has him outmatched from the start of their ordeal.  In the end he is the one who is deprogrammed, of course, but there is nothing but a cartoon vision of manhood on display once we go looking for the grounds of his frailty, and by then, we no longer are asking why someone specializing in psychic imbalances is so obviously untutored in their own.A serious storyteller bent on discussing men and women and their relations to each other must bother to let us know why they are coming together, why they are drawn to each other, why they have troubled by what they find, and so on.  Campion's answers to all of these questions, as they apply to the cult deprogrammer, are laughably thin.  While she gives us a very interesting and rich picture (though incomplete) of what has brought the young woman to this impasse, Campion seems to confirm my suspicion from her earlier films that she is not able to portray men realistically.  Perhaps she has no interest in doing so, but it is a handicap here.  Harvey Keitel has the chops to portray an intelligent and accomplished male who nonetheless gets himself into absurd and vulnerable situations (cf. Head Above Water), but for reasons that must lie in Campion's feminist mystique, he is not permitted to be a complete person.  Yet her subject matter requires one.  That she proves to have affection for both the broken man and the heroine she employs to break him is small comfort for those of us who can see the much more truthful and powerful story that could be told through these wonderfully intimate and raw emotional scenes Campion shows herself capable of creating over and again in the last half of Holy Smoke.  The influence of ideas is too strong in this movie, and it is out of place in a story about people on the edge of themselves.  While she had in her hands the makings of a movie as powerful as Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, she ended up with a confusing mass of disoriented emotion leading nowhere.

This was at odds with the professionalism of Keitel's character initially in the film. 4 - Why did Winslet's character's mother have to be such a moronic suburbanite? She was a complete caricature - drawing one-dimensional characters detracts from the message of the film.All in all, I think this was a very shoddy piece of work which merely showed that Campion had caved in to US money interests and had been forced to produce barely watchable colour-by-numbers dross.

The first time I was a little bit deviated by the english subtitles of the DVD (I had to import me a DVD from the UK, since this movie has not been released in Germany yet!). The subtitles were really necessary because of the heavy Australian accent and because furthermore English is not my mother-tongue. Besides my thus being distracted from several acting details, I did only have a slight imagination, what the point of the movie really was. And without a clear vision, you at times may find the movie embarrassing and often wonder, whether the one or other scene has to be there. Believe me, it has to be. And it needs to be embarrassing at times. Otherwise it won't work. And it did work with me at least at the second viewing so well, that it haunted my sleep.One can't comment on Holy Smoke without stating, what amazingly gifted and daring actors Kate Winslet and Harvey Keitel are. I would even compare them to Liz Taylor and Richard Burton in Who's afraid of Virginia Woolfe?, perhaps the best psychological drama of all times. It is hard to imagine another leading couple of actors, who would have only accepted these roles, not to talk of being able to fill, yes live them in this brilliant way, that was honored by nearly all professional critics (and of course not by the Academy &#150; a fact, which may be seen as an honor on its own). By the way Many of the scenes have been improvised, which renders an incredible authenticity of emotion.When I talk of daring acting, one has to take into account not only the much-discussed physical exposures (Keitel tumbling through the desert in a red dress with lipstick on; Winslet peeing stark-naked in the desert sand, being involved in a homo-erotic dance scene and more stuff like this). These scenes alone are more than noteworthy, but are overshadowed by the psychological exposures, which the actors have the courage to offer us during their journey to themselves.And what a journey this is! It's not less than a fair descent to an inner hell, or to say it with P.J.Waters It's not over...We're still in the cave, but it's a much darker, deeper cave, than it was last night. But the night before, a totally bewildered Ruth (in the notorious watering scene) already had complained You better know what you're doing because this is heart surgery. It's all gone, it's all gone, the love has gone, it's all gone.This is the moment, when P.J. first realizes, that he is to be dragged into the cave as well. The problem (and a keypoint, that some commenters seem to have overseen) is, that, in irresponsible self-overestimation, he had decided to do the exiting without supervisory support. Thus, what could have been a very standard controlled brain-washing becomes a totally uncontrolled trip of two souls, of which you never stop to wonder, whether they are strong or weak. At the metaphoric end of this trip, that some viewers may think of as over the top, the focus of their heavy fight shifts even from mental to physical survival.Thanks God, Jane Campion doesn't leave us alone with our puzzled souls after watching two persons break down, who seem to be so (head-)strong at the beginning of the movie. They have helped each other detect their facade (as a stroke of genius rendered in two mirror scenes) and tear them down. We have gone a long way with two persons, whom the most of us may not have liked particularly, and eventually find them likeable.Of course, this movie is full of clich√©s. Any movie would be. Films can only be picture puzzles of the real life. And I don't think, that it would make much sense, to show the psychological process in more details. Even now, many of the commenters seem to be bored. One word to the family Of course, they are nuts. But I don't like to imagine, what a mental torture this movie might have been without them releasing us with humor in between. Besides that, it shows the other way to handle your problems Just take yourself not to serious and don't care! Would that work for you? If not, I propose, you join the trip. It might be one of the most stimulating journeys of your life. So it was for me. And I don't talk of the wonderful landscape.10/10  "},{"Title":"Laughable Drama","Date":"3 May 2001","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Comedy","Review":"  Holy Smoke! is one of the most ridiculous, pointless movies that I have ever seen in my life.

The direction, choreography, and acting here are all above par, but the script runs out of gas about halfway through and sputters to a dead stop during a horribly inappropriate epilogue. 	I laughed harder at this movie than just about any comedy I have seen all year.  The don't come, don't come scene absolutely destroyed any merit this movie had begun to establish during the opening scenes and should have been left on the cutting room floor.  In fact, just about every sex scene in this movie was completely out of place, contributing nothing to the unusual relationship that was supposedly building between the two leads.  Keep Breathing, Keep Breathing is another example that was so poorly written that its induction into the final movie in amazing. 	The main tragedy of this film is that it really could have been a good movie.  The problem is that for every positive aspect of Holy Smoke! there are two negatives that cannot be overlooked.  Keitel and Winslet effortlessly act their way throughout the entire movie, the problem is that their characters are boring and exhibit poorly written dialogue.  The outback scenery and choreography are gripping at times, but too much of the movie takes place in a silly little hut, interrupted by terrible voice-overs.  This movie also had the most British sounding australian accents I have ever heard too. 	For me, this is one of those B movies that I will always enjoy simply because it is so pointless and stupid.  I could laugh at the first sex scene over beers with my friends for a while.  This movie is entertaining for all the wrong reasons, but definitely a lesson in poor movie making and undoubtedly suited for its place on the straight-to-video rack at the movie store  "},{"Title":"What were the Campion sisters smoking?","Date":"18 January 2001","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Comedy","Review":"  The burning question about `Holy Smoke' is what were Jane and Anna Campion smoking when they wrote this muddle.  Ruth (Kate Winslet) is a confused young woman who goes to India on vacation and falls in with a religious cult.  However, Ruth is not the only one who has an identity crisis.  This entire film has an identity crisis.The film starts out straightforward enough and seems to be a drama about deprogramming cult victims.  As it progresses, it veers willy-nilly into various genres using elements of farce, film noir, camp, satire and sexual perversion to name a few.  Director Jane Campion (Best Writing Oscar and nominated for Best Director for `The Piano') seems to think that to cook a great stew, the chef must include every food known to man.  What this produces is a jumbled mess, with a disconcerting lack of continuity and cohesion.  Lost in this poorly crafted story are some interesting ironies.  The first is how critical the Christian world is of religious cults when all religions, including Christianity are cultish.  The second is how the people who are purportedly doing the saving are often more messed-up than the lost souls they profess to be rescuing.Other than the discombobulated story, Campion's direction is excellent.  She has a wonderful eye and brings numerous beautiful shots and interesting perspectives to the screen.  For instance, she shows great nuance in defining characters by their feet, with numerous close-ups of foot garb and bare feet.  This is a unique perspective, which adds something about the character we wouldn't ordinarily see in a film, but that we would notice if we were actually there.The acting is also excellent.  Harvey Keitel has made a career out of playing dark and outlandish characters, so he is the perfect choice.  His character requires someone who can be both tough and pathetic and Keitel excels at both.  Kate Winslett is something of a mystery.  After coming out of nowhere to hit the big time in `Titanic', she seems determined to slink back into obscurity by playing odd characters in minor films.  Her two films after `Titanic' were `Hideous Kinky' and `Holy Smoke', both third tier vehicles (the two films together grossed less than $4 million compared with `Titanic' at $600 Million in the U.S. and $1.2 Billion worldwide).  She also seems to have an indelible clause in her acting contract that requires every film to have a frontal nude scene no matter how out of shape she gets.  To say that she is Rubenesque in this film is the kindest of understatements.  Despite these peculiarities, her acting is outstanding as always.  Her character is very complex and she plays her enigmatically, where you can never be sure if she is the victim or the manipulator.  Why she doesn't hold out for roles that are more substantial is beyond me. This film has a number of good points that are diluted by an overly ambitious director who throws too much excrement against the wall.  I rated it a 5/10 on the strength of the acting and Campion's photography.  It probably would have worked as a film noir satire of deprogramming if she refrained from making the family so farcical.  This is a film that most people will either love or hate.  I did a little of each.

The story and story-telling was ridicules, the flow was just off and I didn't liked were the movie was heading to and it made me tired watching it, since it made such an absolutely pointless impression.The story is just bad since its hard to believe. Guess these sort of things really happen in the world but it just doesn't ever get believable in the movie, mostly because of the reason that it just never gets interesting. Which character are we supposed to sympathize for? The Kate Winslet one? I don't think so, since she plays a brainwashed, manipulative character, who turned her cheek to her family and 'normal' way of life. The Harvey Keitel one then? No, really not. He's a character that sleeps and slaps around and cheats on his wife.The editing is a reason why the movie just never flows and makes the movie feel incoherent. Also the cinematography makes some odd choices at times. To me some of the shots even seemed amateur like. Weird, since Dion Beebe is an one time Oscar winner- and nominee, so perhaps simply blame the director? Further more the movie uses slow-motion at the oddest times, so that it becomes laughable, instead of effective.The movie gets all the more weird from the moment Harvey Keitel starts to wear a dress. How can you take anything else that's happening after that serious? You can say that the comedy goes at the expense of the drama but this also is vice versa the case. Guess this movie will also be remembered as the one with Harvey Keitel walking in the Australian desert, with full make-up on and in a dress.All of the family characters are supposed to be humorous and a wild bunch of crazy people but their all so horribly stereotypical that this just never works out. All of the actors portraying them also seem to be non-actors, which could had worked for the realism but simply doesn't because of the reason that they were supposed to be comical. Some of the dialog and moments are supposed to be humorous but they all feel awkward. It's almost embarrassing to watch. The endless talking about nothing between the Kate Winslet and Harvey Keitel also don't help to make this movie the most interesting or fast going movies. Just think about it, what gets achieved in this movie? Absolutely nothing and therefor the movie is a totally pointless and redundant one. It tries to go deep but it seems to afraid to ever push really through.No offense or anything but by just looking at this movie you can tell it was directed by a woman. It's just too obvious all. It features lots of dancing and jumping around, sincere and realistic emotions, kissing around and all the male characters have all the usual stereotypical element in them (of which most are true of course). All the men are pigs, who love to drink, try to hide their emotions, slap around and all they try is to get in a woman's pants. The movie is also filled with lots off elements that I suppose are part of female sexual fantasies. All of the sex and love in this movie seems to be focused purely in a way women want it to be. Nothing wrong with that all of course but it just doesn't work for a mainstream movie, with also big name actors in it. After you've already been nominated and have won an Oscar (both for The Piano), you just can't expect from people to take your further work as anything small- and without ambitious intentions.Without Harvey Keitel in it, I would had probably never finished watching this movie. He's a great actor that is great in his role and helps to keep the movie going. And well Kate Winslet, I just never have been really a fan of hers, although she certainly has qualities as an actress. Pam Grier plays a far too small role in this movie. They should had made her role bigger, to provide the movie at least with one more good and interesting character. It also could had uplifted the story and provided it with some more layers.

This is a very entertaining, offbeat semi-drama that fluctuates incredibly between moments of seriousness and those of comedy, sometimes even slapstick(!). It's quite hard to understand what the Campion sisters were getting at; they offer contradicting clues as to how they perceive cults, religion, and blind following of them. Then again, Jane Campion is no intellectual, so there is no point in expecting from her some kind of grand wisdom emanating from a clear vision.Keitel succeeds in turning the naive Winslet away from a silly/hip Indian cult, but she in turn manages to totally destabilize him - to the extent that he admits at the end that that something (divine) happened in the desert. The Campions were trying to make the thing ironic or something, but it's all too foggy. If the movie was meant to have a point it certainly fails in that regard. The finale is particularly confusing and inconsistent (though not unentertaining).There is even a scene between Keitel and Winslet which almost makes no sense at all it's the be kind scene; in this scene Winslet appears to be saying something sarcastic about the be kind thing, the Dalai Lama, bla bla bla, but it then turns out that she was being serious. This kind of scene could justify criticism of the overall movie, I guess. But the rather murky and dubious message is fortunately overshadowed by a great cast, interesting events, and visually beautiful scenes. The movie has a great look. Both Keitel and Winslet are terrific, but it's Winslet's charm and sex-appeal which elevate the film in a way which only she and a handful of other actresses could have done. Some would say that she is too fat (for example, guys who go for thin, young boys) but the scene in which she approaches Keitel naked in the desert is mind-boggling what a body! All-in-all, a movie with flaws, but it's so much fun that it doesn't matter.

I watched it tonight for the first time and was pleasantly surprised. It's really quite profound, I thought. Jane Campion presents the subject of people searching for something in which to believe, getting caught up in groups with gurus, sometimes known as cults. She also presents the family of the person who, as in this case, do everything they can think of to extricate their loved one from what they see as a terrible situation. Yet, the way the family is portrayed, one questions, who is really the crazy one here? Who is really in the terrible situation? Then there's the presentation of the person who is supposedly the expert on deprogramming the person who's been brainwashed, in this case Harvey Keitel, who is going to get Kate Winslet out of the programmed mindset from her Indian guru. I believe the characters are truly profound in their ambiguity. Who is really crazy? Who is really brainwashed and addicted? Who has the right values? In the end, there really are two values, love and kindness, that are worth anything, and love too often gets obfuscated by eroticism. So, really, there's only one thing that counts in day to day life, and that is Kindness, as the character Winslet plays and her mother, demonstrate at the end. Brilliant job, Jane Campion.

It's NOT enough if someone says that I didn't get it, that I got it wrong - it's not about religion. It was *supposed* to be about religion according to the PR for the movie, or they should have found another way to present it to the public. This, I believe, is partly responsible for the outrage people feel, especially if they spent their money to see the film.Second, I am not an airhead, a bimbo, or immature if I think this movie is the absolute low-point in the history of cinema. Just because it's artsy and symbolic and I can't make heads or tails about it, does not mean it's wonderful and just got a bad rep. I, despite what many might like to think, am an intelligent adult who can tell if something is of worth or not. This movie was utter bs. No amount of pop-psychology or Campion-worship is going to make it gold. Even our hero's make mistakes. I understand that there's some who like this, each to us own, but that doesn't make the rest of us stupid or superficial.Now to the actual movie review. My 20 centsWARNING! POSSIBLE SPOILERS!I'm a writer, so I take a storytellers view on movies. However, that doesn't mean that I can't enjoy a movie without hacking it to pieces and analyzing it. I can and I do. Lots.The start *was* promising. It was a little aloof, but we'd get into the story soon. Or that's what I thought.I loved the Indian part of the movie. It was very much eye-candy. So were the hallucinations. Also, Winslet was beautiful in the sari.The first problem arose when I couldn't get enough info about the cult. What did they believe in? What did they do? And most importantly, *why* was it necessary to get Ruth out of it? If they did no harm, were planning no mass-suicide, why was it so urgent to get her out? I've done some research into cults and sects, and this one didn't seem to fill the danger signs. There was some talk of them doing drugs, but this was never confirmed. Actually, I didn't see Ruth do anything the supporting characters didn't do (including smoking pot after announcing she's the only one among her friends who doesn't do drugs...the plot was just so scrambled in so many ways).Ruth's character was too distant. So was Keitel's. I didn't like either, and that's actually pretty rare. There's almost always a redeeming quality in even the worst of characters. These two were cold fish. The only one I felt even the slightest bit for, was Ruth's mom. She might have been the caricature many say she was, but at least I understood her. She didn't even try to be like, so complex and all that.I also didn't understand why the women were so attracted to Keitel's character. Maybe there was a danger aspect that somehow failed to come through? Even so, I couldn't help but guffaw when all these beautiful women threw themselves at him. Please. What's even more bizarre, is the bar scene. First of all, I doubt a professional de-programmer would let the patients relatives just pop by and take her out clubbing, after all, she'd be in a very fragile state. The human mind is complex, it's nothing to toy with. Then, the part where Ruth gets drunk and does a little erotic dance with another girl (all complete with the obligatory sloooow kissing). What's that about? Later in the shack (well, it was a shack) she tells Keitel that she admits she wasn't in control of herself in India. Was this whole bi-thing there just to show how out of control she is? To show how much of a lost soul she is? Just because she kissed a girl? That's a bit old fashioned, don't you think?And the big pee-scene. You who claim that we just don't get it, could you explain what it means? Why did she pee herself? Somekind of animal thing? People often lose control of their bladder/bowel when they die or face death. Is this a symbolic death? Maybe I should email the Campions.The rest of the movie is pretty gross. I can't get a hold on the characters, they are annoying, petty and disturbed. The sex was unnecessary, and the plot was going every which way. It was like a quilt, put together from little pieces of all color.But the real kiss of death to the whole sad story, was the fact that I did not give a damn.

On one hand it has a tremendous silly plot, awful pseudo jokes, stupid characters (oh my God those gay cowboys were so ridiculous!), absurd spoofing about religion (and from different types of religion which is even more illogical), a pathetic acting from Harvey Keitel (he looks so pathetic dressed in that red dress and begging on his knees to the girl merry him&#133; ridiculous!). But then, on the other hand, in spite of all this silliness I guess it has a good and profound message The guy who was strong and was an expert in break up peoples' convictions end up behaving like a little child begging for her love. The confused girl won the battle because in the end she was the strongest and carried on with her own convictions! I think the main message is you can't ever be totally convicted in your beliefs, because you might be wrong, and you should never underestimate other peoples' convictions or beliefs&#133; But, as I said before, aside from this pretty good message (and also from Kate Winslet's nudity, which is another good feature of this movie&#133;) all the rest is pretty awful! The way the plot is developed is terrible, almost all characters are silly, the verdicts about religion(s) are many times inaccurate and unfair, and the relationship of the two main characters is totally forced and unnatural&#133; I appreciated its message, I enjoyed the beauty of Kate Winslet, but I liked nothing else more!

The sad fact of the matter is that their acting is the only merit of this debacle that fails to make any sense. The first twenty or so minutes of the film are interesting and the story seems like its progressing. But its like they wrote the first act and then wrote the rest of the script while in a drunken stupor on a bar napkin. The dialog is intelligent at points, but fails to sustain itself or reach the same level as Keitel and Winslet's first conversation. The outright nonsense that pervades the film, a car having antlers, Winslet walking around naked peeing on herself, only serves to bring the movie closer to B status. The shots of India and the Aussie outback are amazing, but they seem to take up screen time in a attempt save the botched project. Bottomline, a good idea that could have been a good movie, but fell off the horse before the halfway mark.

An Australian girl falls in love with India and with a religious sect 'baba' and does not want to come back to Australia. Her parents love her and hire a private 'deprogramming' agent to convince her to come back.The agent retires with the girl in the middle of the Australian desert. He starts using his well-tested methods to brainwash her. But her will is much stronger than his average patients. Quickly the situation deteriorates - with the analyzer being analyzed, the doctor falling sick, the passenger turning driver.This movie shows how love can reduce a mature, stable, and apparently self-controlled man, into a begging, desperate human being. It shows how someone can become the drug you depend upon - even after years (the agent keeps writing the girl even long after she returns to India).Few movies have something interesting to say about love.

No compromise possible .

The therapist is OK till he is  sexed  by his patient . The movie could stop there .Dispair of the girl that gets reinserted in her own Australian world again , confusing a big need for nurture , care and hugs with physical love from her side and on the other side the therapist that - as so many men - can not resist an extraordinary offered sexual occasion .

There they expect that an expert in taking people's minds off cults (PJ Waters, played by Harvey Keitel) will be able to succeed in doing so with her, but he fails. Instead we've got some raunchy sex among the pair and finally she has her way and leaves her family behind (As a matter of fact I hope that is how it ends, because at this point the movie was so boring that I was barely paying attention).Certainly to see Kate's gorgeous body entirely nude is the only thing that 'saves' the film from being a total shambles. She is so hot, ok?So far this is the only movie I have seen involving her, since I must be one of the few earth dwellers with eyesight who have refused over and over again to see Titanic.I was expecting some kind of serious therapy from Harvey Keitel's character, but my hopes faded away pretty soon. In spite of being good for everyone, having sexual intercourse sure as hell does not help people escape from religious cults (By the way I couldn't agree more with another user who have said all religions are cults).To sum up, a big deception.

I suppose, though it's hard to be sure, that the message of the film was that all things are relative, and hard ass de-programmers are really just as flimsy as are their clients' impressionable teens and young adults.What a loss.

I think the foundation on which this film rested was relevant and intriguing.  Unfortunately, this film treated both groups not as true similes, but as carbon copies of each other (their is a difference).  In other words, the cult follower and the de-programmer were equally weak and devoid of true independent strength.  When this motif was approached with subtlety, there was still hope for the film.  However, subtlety was replaced with brash comic abandon which failed miserably and made me regret investing time in the film to begin with.I want to give this film a two, but Winslet's bold performance inches it up to three out of ten.

This time Keitel is the world's best `cult deprogrammer' and his subject is a religiously confused Kate Winslet.	Holy Smoke is one of those art films that probably won't appeal to the biggest of audiences because of its tone and harsh storyline. Kate Winslet continues to grow as an actress with this risky and risqu√© venture. But it's her spirit and screen presence which brought me in. As her emotions and beliefs crossed with her parents, we began to actually see the two worlds at war for this young girl. These were magical scenes which Campion did a wonderful job with. But as Campion delivers a generous telling of the story and makes it very compassionate and direct for us, we are shocked when Keitel's man's man drop his pants in a comfort scene. And you begin to wonder if this guy is a professional and if he should be looking after a vulnerable young woman. Both in 1996's Portrait of a Lady and in 1993's Piano, we saw this destruction of a man. And Campion continues her escapade here as Keitel delivers quotes of morals but never really believes a word. He self-destructs and delivers his own fiery flight into the flesh of an innocent woman. What made me really cringe was the running time on Keitel's destruction. Campion would never let up and this reminded me a lot of the Piano as well. Is Campion saying that women destroy men or that men destroy themselves with sex? Another begging question is why did a fully nude Winslet have to deliver a `golden shower' before they could embrace and seal his eminent fate? Is this a symbolism of a lost vulnerability and innocence? A cross-dressing Keitel screams after a shoeless Winslet as they stumble through the Australian outback this results in his final undoing and her final deliverance from him. A lot of clouded symbolism and half truths had me scratching my head. Or maybe `Holy Smoke' just isn't for everyone. (2.5 of 5) So Says the Soothsayer.

Kate Winslet stars as Ruth, a twenty-something girl who vists India.  And while she's there, she becomes intrested in the Hindu religion, it isn't until when the Marashi touches her forehead, she becomes hopelessly in love with him and wants to devote her life to him.  Ruth's friend goes back home to Sydney to tell her parents that Ruth has been possessed.  So Mum, (Julie Hamilton) decides to go to India to get Ruth, and bring her back home to Australia.  When both Ruth and her mom come back home, the family hires a professional cult-healer from America named PJ Waters (Harvey Keitel).  When PJ has Ruth in his control at a half-way house in the middle of the outback, it Ruth who is actually under control by seducing PJ, but PJ also does have the last laugh, or does he?      HOLY SMOKE is quite a steamy film that does protray characters well, since it also does show their faults.  Winslet is good as the seductive and at times helpless Ruth, who just wants to get away from PJ.  And Keitel is also very good as the strong PJ, who also does have his weak spots.  Also good is Sophie Lee as Ruth's sister-in-law, Yvonne, who has fallen for PJ.      Campion does a good job with the character's in this film, by having them play with each others minds.  She also does agood job by keeping the film in a good steady pace, and barely ever dragging.  I personally did enjoy the scenes where Keitel's character of PJ is being introduced, with a Neil Diamond song playing in the background.   It's very stylish and humourous at the same time.

While there could ostensibly be a valid link between religion and the inherent conflict/envy of the sexes, the Director never makes it clear; she is off scorning an overdrawn rendering of shallow consumer driven values in an unsympathetic thick-headed Australian family that are too easily dismissed to identify with, although a performance by Miriam Hamilton as Winslit's mother resonates in ways similar characters are culturally confused in British television's Jewel in the Crown, which is no easy feat given the brittle performances of most of the supporting cast in this film.It's too bad, because Ms. Winslet is riveting as a freshly enlightened goddess touched by a cosmic awakening. This young actress literally is poised as a giant on the horizon. I look forward to following her career.I was not a fan of Ms. Campion's `The Piano.' Another film wrecked, I thought, by polemics that are post-feminist-pass√©. And I'm again in the minority in admiring Portrait of a Lady which was held on course by James' source material and a performance by Nicole Kidman.) Using Mr. Keitel's considerable skills in a context that simply isn't convincing for a period piece like The Piano, here too, I found his presence boring and sad. He's an actor that doesn't need to be put in the position of parodying his past film roles at the expense of Ms. Campion's anger towards men. If she had something new to say, fine. But these are attitudes that Lina Wertm√ºller burned up decades ago.Nevertheless, this film toys with something subliminal and mythic albeit indirectly. The isolation of the two characters in a desert setting brings to mind warring Hindu gods in traditional Indian cinema where rocks burst into flame. Their conflict is harrowing because Ms. Winslet's performance is so pungent, earthy and ripe. She is brave to reveal both her vulnerability as well as her intellectual and seductive strength here, particularly admirable for an actress her age. The human cruelty in conflict with her newly found cosmic love; the rage and confusion brought on by betrayal and resentment of her earthbound family and deprogrammer is frightening to witness.The cinematography and use of a sensational eclectic musical score hold the entire film together. Who could guess that an old pop standard by Neil Diamond would be put to use in such a way that would rise to the level a Ravi Shanker raga? It's both amusing and ecstatic. A screenplay that is surprisingly verbal given the lush images was also welcome. A film that is beautiful to look at and full of verbal sparring is a rare one.There's brilliance at work in spite of Ms. Campion's self. I hope she can see past her struggle to be a woman in the film industry and make films that her unconscious and talent--clearly on display here--is struggling to get out.

Naturally her family back home is concerned, and once they pry her away from her new existence (by falsely telling her that her father is dying), they set out trying to reprogram her with help from another guru, a strutting and self-confident American. Director Jane Campion (who also penned the barbed, impertinent screenplay with Anna Campion) knows a great many tricks to gain an audience's attention; by weaving a cinematic spell of compelling visuals and canny soundtrack choices, coupled with a languorous editing technique, Campion absorbs the viewer rapturously in spite of the fact her characters aren't very interesting. Once that initial spell wears off, indignation can set in (as it does here in the exasperating final 20 minutes). Kate Winslet's brainwashed Ruth actually seems a much nicer person back in India. Once she's been taken out to a Halfway Hut in the Aussie desert to have her mind rearranged, she turns into a vicious, sniping brat. I'm pretty sure Campion was making a point here, but the audience is completely turned off by Winslet's antics (plus a naked seduction scene that seems inserted merely to shock). Harvey Keitel is the overage stud hoping to erase Kate's religious spell, and predictably falls under one himself. Keitel is a very appealing actor (and sexily comfortable in front of the camera), and yet his character isn't warm, either. He's playing daddy-teacher-lover to this girl, but there are no sparks between he and Winslet...and no signs that she's getting any better via his treatment. Campion's use of slow-motion is grueling, as are several of her camera set-ups which bring an artiness to the project where such a studied tone is not called for. The picture is a mess, albeit an intensely watchable one. ** from **** "},{"Title":"Unconventional and alternative","Date":"25 November 2006","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Comedy","Review":" This film is about the Kate Winslet's character falling for an Indian religious guru.

Keitel is always outstanding. Kate Winslet however, is not really convincing and although her part demands the portrayal of an extremely neurotic personality, the degree of irritation she evokes in the viewer is excessive. A further flaw is that she is totally miscast as a girl with erotic charisma and the scenes where she appears naked are not to her advantage at all and embarrassing to the viewer.

Like many professional reviewers have said, this film, Holy Smoke, is set up very well - a young lady falling under the spell of a guru in India, and being brought home for de-programming - but the script goes off into never-never land during its second half.It seemed to me Ruth (Kate Winslet) had much more faith and maturity than did P.J. (Harvey Keitel), and a script where she gradually de-programs him, teaching him a better, more generous way of life, would have made a lot more sense.  As we see his character development, we know that his lust for younger women is part of his fabric. And his giving in to Ruth doesn't take much persuading. But Ruth's actions do not seem to fit the good-loving young woman we see in the opening scenes. Turly, it doesn't matter where the story eventually goes, as long as it goes in a direction consistent with where the set-up begins to lead you.  This story does not do that.The subject of the story is serious. However, Ruth's family members are made to look like goofballs. Her brother runs into a metal post while playing a game, later we see him eating pizza with a heavily bandaged nose. Another time, Yvonne is catching kids as they jump from the back of a truck,  She is distracted, a kid goes flying through the air and lands in the dirt with a 'thud.'  Later he is in a cast.

The employment of such a mocking tone could easily open an artist to charges, on the one hand, of anti-religious bigotry and, on the other, of treating too lightly the real devastating consequences &#150; for both the `victim' and their family &#150; of a person's involvement in either the cult itself or the deprogramming that comes after.   For the sheer audacity of her vision then, the Australian filmmaker &#150; along with her co-writing sister, Anna &#150; deserves a certain amount of acknowledgement and praise.  Unfortunately, `Holy Smoke,' after a rather promising first half, falters badly, becoming, in the final analysis, mannered, unfocused and, above all, pointless in both its tone and message.The first half of the film is fitfully amusing as we are introduced to Ruth (Kate Winslet) and her colorful Aussie family, the Barrons.  It seems that Ruth, on a vacation to India, has fallen under the spell of a hypnotic guru and her disapproving family has devised a scheme to haul her back and submit her to the methods and wiles of PJ Waters (Harvey Keitel), the world's most successful cult deprogrammer.  So far so good as Ruth's `mum' (played by the delightful Julie Hamilton) hops aboard a plane to India to find her daughter and bring her back to Australia and, consequently, her senses.   Mum's fumbling attempts to comprehend this alien, exotic culture provide the heartiest laughs in the film.  Unfortunately, once Ruth and PJ are locked away in an isolated cabin in the outback for a bit of one-on-one deprogramming, the film completely loses its way, abandoning the eccentric members of Ruth's family and forcing us to observe, almost exclusively, these two far less interesting characters.  For a while the film does raise a few pointed issues.  We wonder, for instance, what kind of people fall prey to these brainwashing spiritual leaders; then we ask ourselves, if the alternative of returning to a presumably empty existence is really so much better.  We contemplate as well whether the deprogrammer really has the answers - or is he, in addition to restricting the freedom of choice of this adult individual, himself compensating for some internal emptiness he fears to acknowledge?  Sadly, such morally ambiguous themes go largely unexplored, as Ruth and PJ lock horns in an increasingly bizarre and decreasingly funny battle of wills.  Soon, Ruth is wandering aimlessly around the compound stark naked (funny, usually it is Keitel who does the full frontal nudity thing in his films!) and PJ is allowing her to dress him up in women's clothing and daub his face in lipstick and makeup.  As the Campion sisters lose their grasp on the themes they have so brilliantly set up, we become more and more uninterested in the story's outcome.  Ruth never becomes a full-fledged character in her own right.  We are given virtually no inkling of what kind of life she led before her trip to India or of what exactly led to her feeling of spiritual emptiness.  PJ, predictably, violates his own professional ethics code by falling in love and sleeping with his patient, an act that has not the comic thrust to compensate for its queasy distastefulness.  Thus, despite a promising beginning &#150; and some very good performances by a gifted cast &#150; `Holy Smoke' leaves the audience pondering the why and wherefore of its existence.  If one is going to make a comedy out of such touchy material, one had best figure out a clearer destination and map out a better strategy to get there.

Her films based on her original screenplays--SWEETIE, THE PIANO, and now HOLY SMOKE--are among the most repellent works by a major director in contemporary movies.A fusion of Harlequin-romance masochism, chowderheaded post-feminism, and art-school aestheticism, each of this trilogy's movies is a sonata in flamboyant victimisation. But none of Campion's movies has been as off-the-hook bad as HOLY SMOKE, which must rank as the most tone-deaf comedy by a reputable filmmaker since Josef von Sternberg's I DOOD IT.Belchy, loutish Kate Winslet is an Australian girl who finds happiness in an Indian religious sect; Harvey Keitel is the dyed-haired, Binaca-blasting deprogrammer hired to bring her to heel. Robert Altman might find the crazy comedy in the scenes with Winslet's middle-class family, and maybe, in another context, Campion could have found the eroticism. But as it stands, HOLY SMOKE is a jaw-dropping fiasco there isn't a scene in it that makes a lick of human sense, and the only idea that comes through clearly is that Australia is a nation of the dumbest, worst-dressed and most frenetically ill-behaved people on the planet.The progress of Winslet and Keitel's folie a deux is inscrutable. (At one point, we're meant to think that Winslet's religious beliefs fall apart because her family makes her watch a video on the Manson family.) And in the painterly, absurdist scenes that form the movie's climax, with Keitel in a dress and one cowboy boot chasing moonily after Winslet up a hill, Campion's self-plagiarism of her PIANO style grows embarrassing.Jane Campion in the past has been the one mainstream director who has splattered out her own psychosexual rorschach in an uncensored, un-PC way; the liberatory effects of that splat can be thrilling in her work. But, just as male directors mining that terrain often seem to be perpetual juveniles, Campion seems all too closely in touch with the bratty Sydney teen within. HOLY SMOKE is a brat attack--a spoiled bobbysoxer's delusion that she's living out LAST TANGO IN PARIS. That could be a subject for comedy--if the director were Amy Heckerling.

For 10,000 Australian dollars, he promises to turn her back to reality in three days, once they've tricked her into returning home to pay her last respects to her father (who of course is not really dying).

They then entrust Waters to take the voluptuous Ruth out to a remote shack and leave her alone with him for three days. Waters arrives from the airport exuding confidence, professionalism, and charisma.So much for the set-up, which I repeat was quite good. It is therefore all the more disappointing, and yes, actually shocking, that the whole thing turns into a teenage high school movie almost immediately. Waters hardly waits 24 hours before he's humping Ruth. Given her sexuality and beauty, this is not shocking. However, rather than admitting he made an unprofessional mistake and moving on, Waters turns into a love-struck idiot who acts like a person who has taken leave of his wits. He continues to pursue Ruth, even when she tries to push him away by humiliating him (dressing him in a red dress and lipstick) and by insulting him.

It drags on, it's not funny, and the characters are stupid. And why does almost every lead male role in an American film have to be either a sex crazed maniac or psychopathic killer? No wonder boys grow up like this, it's all they see in what they watch. Why is it that PJ Waters has to have two female characters give him oral sex and yet have a girl friend back in the states, and still think he's the man to help anyone? And the women as nurtures and fixers to the problems men bring has been old even before Charles Dickens started writing his satires of the Victorian era, and has never been true at that; Oh, and guess what Ruth! She forgave me. What a bunch of dribble. Horrible.

The piano and the portrait of a lady are excellent. Those movies are my favorites, then I thought Jane Campion had the best films, but when I saw it, I was really disappointed, I never thought that Jane Campion could have done this. This movie lacks of plot, is not interesting at all, the beginning is not good as well as its ending, I really didn't like it. What happened to Jane Campion? I hope she will have a good story in her next movie In the cut. The only good thing of this movie is Kate Winslet's performance, anyway it was very disappointing, I expected more.

It contains more Light, Truth, and more power than almost any other movie out there. This is it, folks. Pay attention and take something with you from this film that you can use to hold yourself together when all your illusions fall away and those you trust betray you. As a filmmaker, woman and a teacher and student of Enlightenment, I give this film my highest recommendation. Kate Winslet is stunning, and has depth beyond what seems possible for her physical age. Harvey Keitel is a brave man. And the mom character breaks hearts with her pure love for her daughter, and her inability, like most of the audience, and like our own parents for those of us who seek enlightenment, to understand what is happening in the face of the apparent loss of a child to a so-called 'cult'. The screenplay is astounding as it constantly reaches higher and higher levels of illumination. It is shocking in its power and truthfulness. If you're looking for something deep, it's here. If you just want rivetting visuals of exotic places like outback Australia or colorful India, this is your ultimate travel video. You want sex? Naked bodies? Naked souls? Spiritual rape? Triumph of purity? It's all here. For your Enlightenment.

Consider me on the South Pole.  I have noted when speaking of this film that Kate Winslet's performance was among her least convincing, and maybe because I am American, especially the Australian accent.  This is even amplified by the fact that there are real Australians in the film.The movie itself needs a lot more to hold my interest.  I couldn't find much in the way of humor present.  It seems like a wacky drama that has an identity problem.  The inclusion of odd and sometimes disgusting scenes only support the idea that the movie is unfocused.  Was the story really about the programming/deprogramming of a confused teenager (Winslet)?  Or was it about the edge of sanity that the deprogrammer (Keitel) seems to fall off of almost instantaneously?  Or was it about a teenager that will rebel against the will of her family just most of the time?  Anywhich way, it hasn't given me enough to even reflect on.Unlike many films with a confusing story (Lost Highway, Magnolia) the edgy scenes and implied thoughts were a distraction from the film as a whole rather than a representation of the feel of the film.  If the film were about a half-hour shorter and focused on what the first 45 minutes of the slowly developing story suggested, I would certainly recommend it.

"},{"Title":"This movie trivializes everything","Date":"11 March 2007","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Comedy","Review":" Holy Smoke starts out promising enough, with Kate Winslett becoming enthralled with a stock Hindu guru. The first warning that something less than serious is happening is the vision of butterflies and flowers surrounding Kate when she becomes enlightened. But the subject matter seems serious enough that you might overlook that. Then, as you might expect, her family calls in a cult deprogrammer to rescue her. I waited patiently for an intelligent portrayal of deprogramming, but the movie veered off into an uneven attempt at lampoon. I was sort of hoping the director could have done a decent spoof of Ted Patrick, but I was disappointed. Finally the movie veers off into a love affair or something that looked like that, but maybe not.I'm pretty sure I have seen other Jane Campion movies, but I don't recall seeing anything like this movie. Somehow she has managed to trivialize religion, cults, cult deprogrammers, India, Australia, gay guys, wives with wandering eyes, and, worse, even managed to trivialize Kate Winslett being naked. I stared at this movie with the same expression the audience had at Springtime For Hitler, but never got beyond that. The only thing this movie has going for it is showing off Kate both dressed and undressed, although you will have to abstract her mentally from the surrounding movie in order to enjoy her.The only analogy I can draw concerning this movie would be to have you imagine an Old Order Amishman portrayed as a beer-swilling redneck with naked girl mud flaps on his buggy, and maybe his beard done up like the Kansas Left Overture album cover.

Basically religious guru PJ Waters (Harvey Keitel) is hired by a low class mother, or something, to try and change her daughter, Ruth Barron's (Winslet) behaviour and attitude. This daughter is quite hard to control sometimes, and she does some pretty drastic things. As the treatment continues he starts to feel close connection to her, and also develops a feminine side. I can't remember that much of the entire film, but the most drastic thing I remember Winslet doing was burning the barn (where she slept) and coming out of the dark fully naked. Kate Winslet was number 55, and Harvey Keitel number 53 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Winslet was also number 2 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses. Good!

Her shot selection and integration with the cast was marvelous because she melded the details of life in the out-back with the complexity of her story. To begin the film in the crowded tangle of Poona, India and then contrastingly develop the story in the emptiness of out-back Australia with the obvious metaphor of the previous life of Kate's character was a great bit of movie making to me.I believe that metaphor was continued throughout; the viewer is continually reminded of the rich humanism of her life in India and the emotional impoverishment of her life in the West.Holy Smoke is a tremendously rich, meaty and emotional tale oflife and Ms Campion is to be lauded for her work.

Though their characters are as vague as the film's purpose, Keitel and Winslet are the only reasons to spend time with this flick. "}]
