They are wrong, but I know why they hate it. They take it too seriously. They are too easily offended. They fail to pick up on the subtle little reminders that Peter Berg includes every once in awhile to let you know, hey, this is a comedy. The story revolves around a main character, who is soon to be wed to a dominating fianc√©, who seems to love the idea of having a big wedding more than she loves her her future husband. Well, our main character and his four closest buddies are off to Vegas for one last night of freedom and fun. In the group you have a pair of Jewish brothers that hate each other, a confused mechanic, and a real estate agent that is a cross between Anthony Robbins and Charles Manson. Well, not to give anything away, but let's just say that some very bad things happen in Vegas, very bad things, and how it will play out after that, well, it is just too entertaining to watch. The acting in this movie is superb, I mean great. The story is fantastic, with tons of hooks and switches. Yes, there is violence and somethings happen, that if they occurred in real life, well, you might be disturbed. HOWEVER, this is a movie! And it is one of my favorite films of all-time. I give it a 10, without hesitation.

It is a morality lesson and reason(if you need one) never to kill - or at least if you do not to burden yourselves with accomplices.The reactions of those involved range from complete horror and remorse (Stern) to pure psychopathy (Slater) - who is able to dehumanise the first victim immediately, demeaning her to the mere status of an inconvenience to be disposed of  (this is how many serial killers think)This film gives lots of other valuable insights - and if you only come away from it certain that morality is not a democratic process but a matter of absolute right and wrong, then this movie has done what few achieve; it has educated you morally - following the majority blindly is one of mankinds greatest follies.Slater is brilliant in his runaway amorality, as is Stern in his bouts of tortured guilt (the scene in the gas station when his kids demand 'Whizzers' is excruciatingly funny and at the same time so poignant that you may experience guilt yourself at finding the mental collapse of the most decent character in the film so hilarious)Cameron Diaz plays the bride from hell with assuredness and gusto - if this movie puts you off murder it may well also put you off marriage.

It's pretty much unpleasant from beginning to end, from prostitution to fratricide, and not in the least life-affirming. Everyone, from the psychopathic realtor played by Slater, to the morally vacuous and weak-willed groom-to-be is grotesque. However, I venture to add it IS funny, and it IS clever.Not merely, as Americans like to say, 'gross out' funny, but morally satirical. One of the darkest moments of the film is where the practising Jew character, the most morally developed of all in the movie has an attack of conscience as the group are preparing to dispose of the bodies of a prostitute and a security guard out in the desert.He says they must observe the Jewish practice that requires the bodies to be interred as complete, which provies impossible as both have been hacked up, wrapped up in plastic and distributed amongst four suitcases. What follows is a gruesome jigsaw puzzle of body parts, culminating a great sight gag of them lying out neatly arranged.There is a more serious premise behind the story of how five apparently ordinary guys who start out on a bachelor weekend are drawn progressively into more and more despicable acts. One of the great moral questions, from the time of the Greek moral philosophers to our own experience of the holocaust is how men come to do evil.Are there just some evil men, waiting for their potential to be awakened, or is there the potential in all of us, if we are given the excuse and the opportunity? Or is all that is required for evil, as the axiom states, that good men do nothing? Certainly, in the early part of the movie when the first death is down to an accident resulting from a series of misdemeanours, the more moral and sympathetic members of the groups are crucially transfixed by the possible damage to themselves from coming clean at that point.It's at that point that Slater's character, the charming, functioning psychopath (he does them so well) is able to seize the initiative, provide what appears to be a practical and just about morally palatable solution to their problem and a path back to normality.This is the true moral junction of the film; everything beyond that is a satirical commentary on their inability to do the one good thing required of them - come clean at the outset. Trying to read the film as totally naturalistic beyond that point doesn't work - it becomes increasingly absurd and unpredictable for comic purposes.This is a very wordy movie. The script is subtle and complex, and a large part of that is given over to Slater and his persuasive speeches on why a particular course of action should be taken at a particular time.In the beginning, he exhorts the group that they should cover up the prostitute's death and provides practical arguments to support this, seizing on the upcoming wedding as a moral defence for the actions they are going to commit. The movie's absurdity lies in the ever more extreme and disproportionate acts the group are prepared to commit simply for a wedding to take place.But there is a serious point underlying this. One common facet of 'organised evil' by apparently normal, moral individuals is the belief that unpleasant acts are necessary for a greater good. This becomes a device to obscure the badness of the bad things because the intent remains good. Should we judge acts by themselves or their intent?The film suggests, in contemporary society, we've descended even lower. We are obsessed by the appearance of morality rather than the actual practice of it. A society obsessed by symbols, ceremony and rituals rather than the truths they are supposed to represent. And Cameron Diaz is a wonderful exemplar of that ideal as the ruthless bride who steals the last 10 minutes of the movie.

It's fun while being depressing. *** (out of four)","Date":"31 August 2001","Score":"25 out of 33 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Thriller","Review":"  VERY BAD THINGS / (1998) *** (out of four)By Blake FrenchAllow me to be the first to say that what we have done here is not a good thing. It's definitely not a good thing. But it was, given the circumstances, the smart play. --Robert BoydIf anything, Peter Berg's Very Bad Things triggers a response, regardless of the nature. My initial reaction to the dark, disturbing parody was bleak and unpleasant. The movie displays sick, demented behavior and despicable, annoying characters. It's not humanly possible to like anyone in the movie. Christian Slater's character is cruel and selfish. Cameron Diaz displays a whiny, obsessive portrayal. I needed an aspirin during this unfunny mess.I viewed the film a second time; surprisingly, my opinion differed greatly. I liked all the same parts, but this time, my attitude changed. I watched with more of an open mind-the film is advertised as a dark comedy, but-although a few explosively funny moments occur-the film seldom provokes laughs. It's important to watch abstractly, with no remorse or guilt for enjoying the unholy revelation of events. Everything that happens here makes perfect sense under the circumstances. If you don't expect a light hearted, laugh a minute comedy, then Very Bad Things fulfills a long-needed niche in Hollywood.Very Bad Things is, like the tagline notes, a very savage comedy. It does not paint a happy portrait of our society-it's a scathing satire on American values. It's needlessly racist, sexist, and vulgar. It depicts a gross portrayal of modern families, the delicate but perverse male mindset, disgusting bachelor parties, and even the happiest day of many lives-the wedding day.Cameron Diaz plays Laura Garrety, a selfish, whiny bride-to-be. She's getting married in three days to a handsome fellow named Kyle Fisher (Jon Faveau from Swingers). She isn't happy with his decision to travel to Vegas with his friends for a bachelor party. They include two bickering brothers, Adam (Daniel Stern), and Michael (Jeremy Piven, who stepped into the role after Adam Sandler stepped out to make The Waterboy.), as well as an organized but cruel real estate agent named Robert Boyd (Christian Slater), and a quiet mechanic named Charles Moore (Leland Orser).Once they arrive in Vegas, a stylistic montage sequence shows the five friends gambling, snorting cocaine, and drinking lots of alcohol. They settle in for the night at a fancy hotel, where a stripper (Carla Scott) arrives and lap dances the guys into a frenzy. Michael takes her into the bathroom for sex, but accidentally drives the stripper's head into a towel hook, instantly killing her. The rest of the men panic and want to call for help, but Boyd has a better idea. He wants to bury the body in the nearby desert. The intrusion of a hotel security guard complicates the issue. Boyd kills him with a corkscrew during a particularly unpleasant scene. The rest decide to use a chain saw to cut up the bodies and carry them to the desert in suitcases, where they do indeed put the unfortunate souls underground.Although not for the easily offended, Very Bad Things takes us on a roller coaster ride through immorality and its consequences. It's fun watching the sequences of events, the bodies piling up, and the exaggeration of our most improper impulses.  A great cast demonstrates their fine acting abilities. The script, also by Peter Berg, features very smart, witty dialogue. Berg directs the chaos with an engaging style-especially during the scenes in Vegas, and keeps the momentum throughout the movie. If the filmmakers played the material as straight drama, it might have worked even better, but as it is, Very Bad Things is a joy ride through harsh satire.

So don't say I didn't warn you.  Besides, the video/DVD cover shows Christian Slater holding a chainsaw.  How much warning do you need?  First of all, Very Bad Things works out better if you don't treat it as a straightforward comedy.  It's basically a mix of suspense and comedy.  Almost like Fargo.  Now before you jump on me, VBT is nowhere near as great as Fargo, but the two films are practically equal in tone. At least the film contains one element that some comedies lack  the characters AREN'T acting as if they're in a comedy!  When the characters panic and do foolish things, they're not contrived comic moments.  People do the most absurd things when they panic.  It's hard to explain what exactly it is that makes the film funny.  You just have to watch the film.  But people really, really mean it when they label this as a dark comedy.  Writer/director Peter Berg tries to keep a somewhat quirky tone, though.  There are some slanty camera angles and the soundtrack conflicts with the tone of each scene.  Don't worry, it's done intentionally.  Berg, who's known mostly as an actor in films like Cop Land and The Great White Hype, makes a fine directorial debut, though there is some improper pacing.  Finally, the actors are what make this film most worth seeing.  I've always been a fan of Christian Slater, and believe him to be an underrated talent.  He seems passionate about every character he plays, and spouts out every line of dialogue like it's poetry.  His character is very interesting, as he seems to keep his cool in every situation, no matter how tragic or violent.  Daniel Stern's another underrated talent, since he mostly does lightweight family comedies like the Home Alone flicks, and does a great job at playing his constantly paranoid character, who's the complete opposite of Slater's.  Cameron Diaz gives a fine comic performance as the tightly-wound, hot-tempered wife of Jon Favreau.  I think this is one of her most unique performances up-to-date.  I think this was before she became such a sex symbol.  Now fame has gone a little bit more to her head, starring in such throwaway flicks as the Charlie's Angels films and The Sweetest Thing.  She is in fact a very talented actress, but this movie most proves that she's more than just a pretty face.  Speaking of pretty faces, Jeanne Tripplehorn also gives a fine comic performance as Stern's tightly-wound wife.  I consider myself an admirer of dark comedies, but any type of film can fail.  This one doesn't.  It made me laugh and kept me in suspense.  And it has a great share of profanity, violence and nudity (that Asian stripper was deliciously hot!!!).  Very Bad Things is not for the straitlaced, or faint of heart, but for the rest of us--have fun!!!My score  7 (out of 10)           "},{"Title":"Very Bad Things is in Very Bad Taste, but you may enjoy it!","Date":"2 July 2005","Score":"14 out of 14 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Thriller","Review":" I am positive that at least 50% of the people seeing Very Bad Things for the first time are going to hate it outright. They are going to be offended by the sensationalistic violence, by the sociopathic behavior of the principals, and by the portrayal of women as harpies and of men as buffoons and clowns. They will hate the way the movie portrays marriage and family and children. They will hate the vulgar language and the drunken maundering and the utter charmlessness of almost every character in the film. And they will especially hate the excruciating progression of the plot. In the tradition of Hitchcockian films like Shallow Grave, A Simple Plan, and Dead In the Water, the events in the plot start out with a of a bad mistake, compounded by the worst aspects of human nature... and then motives of greed and fear cause more mistakes, things start to spiral out of control, and finally one mistake piles onto another until things are so awful that suicide seems like an easy way out...and in fact, an amazingly large number of people end up dead. That can be hard to watch, and it isn't every body's cup of tea. I fall into the other 50%, the group who enjoy this kind of savage, mean-spirited humor. I am of the opinion that Berg made exactly the film he wanted to make, and that he left it up to the audience to take it or leave it. I think that Berg wanted to hit a top note of wicked glee right away, and to sustain it for as long as he possibly could. And I think that the actors - Favreau, Slater, and Stern especially - came through with hysteric, overblown performances that make the movie exhausting and hard to watch in spots. But there is JUST enough believability to their performances that you feel as if that could be you, stuck in their place. Special kudos also go to Cameron Diaz for being willing to play such a narcissistic twit, somewhat of a stretch from the sunny, happy All American Girl types she has done so well over the last few years, And to Jeanne Tripplehorn, as the baffled and angry wife of one of the brothers, who knows something is wrong and can't be deflected until she learns the truth.The final shot, as Diaz's character runs screaming out the dream home-turned-nightmare to collapse gibbering in the street, is priceless, and serves as kind of a cosmic punchline to all the mayhem, murder, and malice of the presetting 90 minutes, and leaves me with a guilty grin on my face and a huge sense of relief - my life looks so good compared to what just went on in the movie that I want to dance like a white guy! The proper reaction to Very Bad Things probably ranges somewhere between a horrified giggles and the drunken bray of startled laughter you would make after hearing a really good dead baby joke for the first time.

But definitely nothing in the  middle. Very Bad Things will antagonise most. It's certainly not the comedy it's touted to be. It's uncomfortable and it's fascinating.Very Bad Things is a cautionary tale about the war of the sexes, the battle of consumerism. It's about collateral damage Friendly fire is liable to take out just about anyone in the suburbs if a wedding is at stake! It's about people who have lost heart, who have forgotten what's really important.Five male friends are off to Las Vegas for a stag party. The bride stays home to continue the wedding preparations; to plan her day of days. Accidentally the boys kill a prostitute in their hotel room and decide to hush it up, bury her in the desert to avoid the unpleasantness of an investigation. And then the body count mounts.The boys, and later, just as viciously the bride, take the pragmatic road. That same let's get on with business, people don't matter sort of morality that will allow a President to lie to Congress and get away with it, cricket champions to cheat and then be made Captain, politicians to sacrifice their citizens for the sake of overseas companies, and murder to be acceptable as long as no one finds out about it. It's not how you play the game, but you must win.The boys are pretty average types really except for Robert Boyd (Christian Slater, who was let out of prison to do the shoot!!!). Robert Boyd is a Men's Support Group graduate. He's into self fulfilment and asserting himself but is also the catalyst that tips these average men into horror. The other dominant personality is the bride Laura played by Cameron Diaz (There's Something About Mary). Her single mindedness is astounding. (Cameron Diaz is an astounding actress! Watch her eyes.)But what is  average in these suburbs. And what about the pressures that go with paying the mortgage and keeping the wife happy? Very Bad Things finishes with a slow overhead shot of the suburb that has become hell for this lot. The tones are dirty grey. The mood is bleak and hopeless. The residents have sold their souls for a white minivan and a posh wedding.  The pressures of keeping up with the Jones have had casualties.There are continual references to being 'a loser' in the film. Even Kyle's Dad in the Toast To The Groom at the wedding refers vividly to his son's dismal failure as a school football player. The men are liable to crack.Very Bad Things is about the pressure cooker male bread winners are living in.  The fear of failure is lurking menacingly near by. The men in the film appear to be doing reasonably well from a fiscal point of view but when the pressure rises, the girl in the hotel room dies, horrible things happen with Boyd egging them on.The editing is ferocious, the characters are vivid and the mood is very wry indeed. Don't expect to laugh much but hell, paying the mortgage isn't much fun either.Men have been reacting to the mess they are in in the 90's but I would say that writer/director Peter Berg doesn't think much of Men's self help groups. Slater's Robert Boyd has twisted self assertiveness to his own ends. These suburbanites commit horrendous crimes, but still, we should all consider what the men in Very Bad Things are up against.The phrase you do love me don't you from the women in their lives has never sounded more manipulative.

Although in my opinion this film portrays the simplicity of the lying snowball effect and how it always comes to a disaster of an ending. For anybody who can't see past the comedy of it or the realism of it, maybe think of it like that. It upsets me when I hear how unrealistic this movie is when the director was OBVIOUSLY not trying to make it realistic. I don't like the comparison to Something about Mary though, two completely different genres of comedy. Laughing at a horror movie and appreciating a true dark comedy are two totally different things, (for those who say they like dark comedies then list off five horror movies!). You will like this film if you enjoyed self-destructing films such as, Serial Mom, Fargo, and even Bad Santa (in my opinion!)

Disappointed that this film is not more relished and so mistaken.  It is a dark comedy.  But it is not slap stick dark humour.  It is dark satire, a deeper and more impenetritive subset of the dark humour genre.This film makes so many observations and comments on society and moral perspectives in 90 odd minutes its remarkable.  All the characters react in semi-cliche ways; sensible, guilty, self-preserving, controlling etc.  Ironically enough it is the main character, that doesnt really say much, that keeps best control of himself, not Slater who, while trying to control the situation loses control of himself.Many people do seem to be able to accept undertoned acting alongside with over the top, but I think Peter Berg juggles this so well that it was intensely entertaining through out.  People seem not to be able to accept that they dislike the characters.  This is vitally important to the film.  If there was empathy with the characters, all the violence would be out of place, or turn to slap stick.  The characters are however, very familiar, which makes things uncomfortable, but I think the essence to the humour the director wants to present.I can see that people might not like this film, but I do feel that they are missing the point of it.  Sorry to sound snobby or somesuch.  I give this 8/10.************************Just had to respond to one of the comments below, condemning the way the death of the prostitute was handled.Surely the whole point of the way the prostitute was handle by the five high, drunk guys was disgraceful.  Treating her as an object that could be f*****d, killed and buried in the desert by most of the characters enforces the dislike for them, despite seemingly knowing that kind of person in everything else they do.  You are right that women should never be treated or thought of like the girl was, but REMEMBER IT IS ALL HAPPENING ONLY IN A FILM.  I do not believe the director/writer, actors and any one else involved were actually as misogynistic as you think they are.  And I cannot believe you call yourself a film buff and be offended by this.

The plot starts out simple, a few days before his wedding, Kyle Fisher (Swinger's John Favreau) and his friends head to Las Vegas for a bachelor party headed by Fisher's pal Boyd (Christian Slater, doing a WAY over the top Jack Nicholson here).  All goes well until the stripper dies and thus begins the movie.  The characters scramble to hide the evidence of the corpse and accidental murder, however, with each passing scene, the plot twists and turns a little bit more and the bodies keep piling up.  Things get even worse when Fisher's fiancee (Cameron Diaz doing her best 'bitch' in a hilarious turn) finds out about what's been going on and gets in on the 'action'.Very Bad Things is a very, very dark comedy, mainstream viewers will no doubt be disgusted, while politically correct filmgoers will more than likely balk at the proceedings, those with a taste for the dark will find much to relish here.  The cast is great, however, Christian Slater steals the show as a held over 80's-ish yuppie whom speaks in self help phrases and has an overly psychotic side.  Cameron Diaz plays the bitch to the hilt and with pure relish, and while this film certainly isn't everybody's cup o' tea, it's a movie filled with outrageous, gory and revolting goings on, and those with the ability to tune into their darker sides, will love every minute of it!

I rented the VHS at my local gas station and teenage mind was expecting the best from the dark worst of it. Billed as a dark comedy, I did not find it funny. I found it boring. However, many, many, many (more than a decade) years later I have revisited Very Bad Things, to see if the teen critic missed anything.Verdict still a very bad movie.The dialog is annoying along with the acting. The problem seems to be funny is replaced by loudness and yelling a lot. Everyone is constantly yelling their lines at each other. It is hard to sit through. I am a huge fan of dark comedies, bad comedies, morbid/ bloody humor, and just laughing in general. However, Very Bad Things is just bad without being the enjoyable kind of bad to me.The premise is fun. The movie should have been fun. It's like being in a room of drunk people who are having a good time and laughing at everything, only you're sober and all of their actions are actually annoying and they are just all jerks.The premise is not really capitalized on in a logical way. I'd watch a remake that fills in the holes. I mean, really, the entire movie hinges on a single incident that in reality never would have played out the way it did. Yes, truth is often stranger than fiction, but this movie did not let me just relax and buy into the logic. Actually, I think stupid people in reality would make the stupid choices some of the characters made, even though it was ridiculously unnecessary, however, the movie did not sell me on it and was just a groaner.

Once they have finally gotten rid of the bodies, they try to return home in one piece, but some of them feel too guilty about the ordeal and a lot of people end up dying in very bizarre ways. Does this sound like a comedy? Believe it or not, it is. However, it would take a lot of talent to make something as twisted as this funny. Director Peter Berg only occasionally succeeds. However, most of the material that could be funny ends up being overshadowed by the graphic violence and gore. This film is a little too gory in my opinion. There are some pretty despicable scenes herein. They are the kinds of scenes in which, if you tuned in at those very scenes, they would make the film look like a horror film. One scene in particular involves the sounds of a man bleeding to death on the other side of a door that is being forced shut by the main characters. This kind of violence and comedy can be balanced out in creative ways. Just look at the early films of the Coen brothers. This film just pushes the macabre level a little too far for me to stomach. Overall, the film is effective enough to see at least once, but I want to see a story like this told in a serious light. That could be interesting.

I suspected going into it, that this was not a good movie, and it got worse the longer it went. The writer and director was Peter Berg, a 30-something actor who was best known as a doctor on Chicago Hope TV series. What he tried to do here was make a very dark comedy, but the sum of his efforts is just plain junk. Some spoilers follow...The evil character, and the ultimate catalyst for most of the bad things, is played by Christian Slater. What irony in a name. Five guys go to Vegas for a last fling batchelor party, booze, drugs, a prostitute.  During sex in the bathroom, the back of the prostitute's head is accidentally impaled on a bathrobe hook. Calming the others down, Slater convinces them it would be better to just bury her in the desert, after all she's just a prostitute. Until the hotel security guard happens in, sees the body, and he is murdered. Perhaps the worst thing about the film was the next scene, in the hotel bathroom, where they are dismembering the bodies, to put them in suitcases, to carry out. The director goes out of his way to make it look guresome, with blood and flesh hanging off the saw blade. Just poor, poor taste in film-making.They get back home, Slater is calm, several of the others are guilt-ridden. Gradually, others get killed off. Daniel Stern's character when his brother rams him and his minivan. Wife (Jeanne Tripplehorn) gets wise, Slater tries to smother her at night, they fight, she gets killed, brother-in-law is shot and killed to make it look like suicide. The bride, Cameron Diaz, has waited 27 years for this and is going to walk down that aisle. In a fit, right before the wedding, she bludgeons Slater with the metal base of a large coat rack, and he eventually dies after falling backward at the top of stairs when someone was going to retrieve the rings for the ceremony.The new husband and friend get into a car accident, flies through the windshield, loses the lower halves of both legs, and is confined to a wheelchair. The death of the couple, whose will specified that thier two sons would be cared for by the new couple.  The movie ends with Diaz going crazy in the street, as she realizes what personal hell she now is in.I believe a good movie could have been made, but not one that tries for comedy with the subject matter as presented. The storyline is not particularly well-tracked, and the acting is far too often over the top. I predict that in time, this will be remembered as one of the worse movies ever made. It is the very first one that I rate 1 of 10 on the Imdb.

I mean that this film pushes itself over a cliff and revels in every single inch of the fall.  While this film could be called the blackest of black comedies, I am not sure that this appellation will adequately cover the extent of the horror-show that follows on the heels of the relatively bland premise (bachelor party goes awry).Parody is the ultimate stage in any genre, Airplane for disaster films, Blazing Saddles for Westerns and Scream for slasher films.  However, how does one parody the black comedy, how does one make fun of one of the most self-conscious genres of film in existence?  Peter Berg makes Very Bad Things.I think that this film is perhaps too close to home for many people to enjoy, but this is because I think that they misunderstand what appears to be the fundamental premise.  A black comedy works, because incongruous elements are spliced together in such a way that the director sends a wink-nudge to the hipper elements of the audience.  Very Bad Things works precisely because it does not.  There are no incongruous elements, the film is a straightforward story of brutality and slaughter, but it is presented in the frame of a comedy rather than in the frame of a thriller.  This puts the audience into a mode where they cannot help but laugh at the horrible things that they see on the screen.The reason that VBT works is not because it is funny, but because it is so decidedly un-funny... yet it still manages to get the requisite number of laughs from the audience (who mostly cannot understand why they are laughing).  This is easily one of the most subversive and clever films that I have seen in a very long time and I am glad that I got to see it in the theater with audience on two separate occasions before it disappeared.  I believe firmly that this film will one day be recognized for its aweful splendor and impressive intelligence.  I hope that I am around to see it.

I went into watching it with some anticipation as I am a great fan of Jon Favreau and Jeremy Piven, not to mention the fact that Cameron Diaz is nice to look at.  The film sets its tone early on and warns you that all of these characters love confrontation and that the heart of the movie is going to be arguing between the leads.  Once the film gets going at the bachelor party and it is made evident at just how over-the-top the characters are going with their drugs, alcohol and whatever else they decide might be fun, I found myself almost not wanting to watch what would happen next. It was that unpleasant. I'm not talking about the amount of blood and gore, but the level of emotion that each of the characters was working on. I can see that this movie is attempting to be a dark comedy, but it just becomes far too dark to save itself for a few good laughs. The amount of screaming and whining I had to endure throughout was nothing short of aggravating and I found myself not really caring what happened to the characters... be it good or bad. This is where I had a problem with the film. I just didn't care about the characters. I didn't find myself wanting to see them get punished for what they'd done, nor did I want there to be a happy ending for those of them who were truly guilt-ridden. There was only so much shouting and bickering that I could take, before I was left wanting the movie to end before I found out what happened. I mean the nastiness of each of them wasn't even entertaining.  Despite the fact that I found the film truly forgettable, which is strange considering the amount of shock-value the film held, I did think that the performances were all solid and did nothing to damage the already doomed story.

I really did. I found it to be continuously, outrageously funny. The problem with the world today is that we are afraid to express our more primal instincts. We see something that appeals on a pure visceral level and we are conditioned to respond with shock and horror. Many, many reviewers have said that this movie made them physically ill. Well, I'm sorry to say, but if a piece of fictional work can create such a drastic emotional response, then you need more help than the characters in this film. At least Christian Slater's character has a pragmatic approach to extreme situations. It may not agree with the value system that you have been brainwashed into accepting as normal, but it sure is effective. In fact, the downfall of all the characters in this film is not some vague idea that evil begets evil or of karmatic retribution. It is that the rest of the people involved in this situation are unable to overcome their own societical brainwashing and act in the same sensible manner as Boyd. As one branded as abnormal by those who conform to the norms of American life, I give this film 10/10.

That's okay by me, and I liked it. Look what it's about for god's sake five guys go to vegas for a bachelor party, end up with a dead hooker on their hands, and they have to get rid of her.

Oh sure lots of suspense and tension, but have you actually ever felt honest-to-goodness panic? I guess the frustration and semi-desperation is the closest thing, and this does it well.  It's a maddening film to watch, not just because of the paranoia that over takes (just about) each of the five friends successively, but because you think to yourself that if you were in that situation you'd be able to keep your head, and oh christ if I could just get in there and tell them all to just shut the f**k up!.

The movie opens with a few scenes to set up one of the dipoles that will contrast with and enervate most of what follows.  Jon Favreau (Kyle Fisher) is soon to be married to Cameron Diez (Laura Garrety) but he is being pressured by his buddies, and most especially by his best bud Robert Boyd (played in an excellent upgrading of his role in Heathers by Christian Slater), the have a Vegas style bachelor party.  Laura allows his night with the boys; all she wants is to get married. By the time the party's over the pals have killed two people one inadvertently and the other basically at the behest of Robert who is determined to get them out of the mess of the first killing at any cost and reveals a pathological penchant for homicide.  It's not the last time that he will convince the guys that they will have to kill to be safe.......and as the paranoia intensifies his targets get uncomfortably close to home. Much of what ensues puts this film amongst the blackest of black comedies but by the movie's end everyone has gotten what is coming to them. Everyone that's left that is. The movie is not for everyone but if you can enjoy an incisive and uncompromisingly clear sighted exploration of the darker side of life, friends and marriage in the 90s this film is probably for you.

By the titles, however, it was pretty much full, as people found their options limited by an increasing number of sold-out screens.The film itself started at a reasonable pace, although there were far too many meaningful pauses and conversations, and Cameron Diaz was over-acting to the point of me just wanting to grab her and give her a shake to try and calm her down.Then they got to Vegas, and any semblance of affinity that I may have felt for the group fell away as they were seen taking line after line of cocaine in their room - by the time they got round to killing Tina, I could not have cared less what happened to them.There is little that I can say about the gruesome nature of the film from this point on that has not already been said, but suffice it to say that I have not walked out of a film in three years, but resolved to do so after the security guard was despatched.  However, to add insult to injury, I dropped my car keys as I was standing up and could not find them in the dark and was forced to remain until the end.To give the film credit, there was some very strong acting as the quintet was diminished and fell into psychological disarray, but it was bound together by the most grizzly sequences I have ever seen, and one of my favourite films is Starship Troopers.  It all smacked of a director without the courage of his convictions to create the shock through suggestion and implication as would have been done by so many others.  This was film direction at its most two dimensional and immature.However, it was perhaps something entirely out with the production teams control that disturbed me the most, and that was the reaction throughout of a Glasgow audience fueled by beer before they came in, and perhaps desiring a comedy but finding it sold out, so choosing another film that they would be determined to find funny irrespective of the subject matter.  I was constantly bemused by people laughing at genuinely shocking imagery, particularly at the end.  The sight of someone spinning in a wheelchair with a feed tube in his mouth does not make me laugh.  At all.So all in all, I found it a thoroughly disagreeable experience, although to close I would have to say that it may just be that I am getting old and simply missed the point - although on reflection, the day that I find material such as this entertaining is the day I start to reconsider my values completely.

However those that do have a sick humor and don't get turned off by very graphic violence you will probubly love this movie.The performances are one of the best reasons to see this movie. Christian Slater gives by far his best role as the sick minded real estate agent who will result to anything to cover up a murder.  Cameron Diaz made a dramatic turn from an open hearted, mentally challenged lover in There's Something About Mary to a very stood up, self-centred, about to be married 27 year old woman whom dosen't have anything go her way.  Other roles are very well done including Daniel Stern's change from a normal man into a psychotic filled with guilt.The film loses a lot as it goes along but the scenes in Las Vegas are very hard to live up to, they had a great sense of realism and diologue that Quentin Tarantino would have been proud to say he wrote.  At times you can't help but feel the director just didn't know where to end it but luckily the performances and diologue pull if off and make up for it.

Needless to say, this is a noisy film,full of yelling and hysterics and certainly not a good film to lull one to bed.First, I thought the scene where they are fooling around in the hotel room overly long, silly and noisy.  Perhaps I have too much faith in mankind to believe that grown, professional men, at least one of which is a father, could suddenly behave in such a gross way. However, the inclusion of the hooker was believable. The way in which she died was not so believable as the hook didn't look so sharp and therefore would require much force to penetrate the cranium, but I can suspend belief and imagine a sharper, though much less likely on the back of a hotel door, hook. I couldn't suspend my belief enough however to believe that the effect of so much drugs could so quickly be nullified when the security guard showed up and the following activities.Where things got very interesting was Christian Slater's role as a classic and dangerous psychopath.  The point where the psychopath turns from acceptable to unacceptable behaviour is particularly interesting, and Christian Slater managed the change almost too well; given his other roles and the look in his eye in each, I almost wonder whether he himself has psychopathic tendencies or some other moral wasteland within his brain. While his character is abhorrent, he is such an almost perfect study that it is worth the time alone to watch the movie.Cameron Diaz wins me over then loses me with garbage like Charlie's Angels and any other of her butt-wiggling movies.  In this one, like in Being John Malkovich, her part is hilarious as the male vision of the prima donna bride. Her one-track mind as she gets closer to her wedding surely resonates with many women who marry for the wedding and forget about the man (possibly a reason for so many divorces), and one surely does not suspect the ending but are extremely gratified by it - and reminiscent of a Coen movie which elevated this movie somewhat.I am unsure as to how I felt about Jeanne Tripplehorn.  She is so pretty, yet so nauseating as a common house frau - I may have preferred someone more dowdy and believable but perhaps this is the exact effect the director wanted. I will want to see the movie again to study that character.I certainly get Daniel Stern's jump in front of his minivan which is so Tarantino. People are so weird - if this was an amazing car or something, we almost would agree that we would try to stop someone from smashing our beloved toy by jumping in front. But this is a minivan - yuck - but it is what the minivan represents to him that is so symbolic.  The crash was the end of his placid, family life,and he knew it. The fact that he died really didn't do anything but physically push the point home. I think I may have rather seen him complete his descent into insanity after the crash.The story itself is not so unbelievable - especially with the involvement of many weak individuals under the influence of a pyschopath and a bride. The only thing I really didn't like was the cheap Jew reference - really unnecessary as I am not sure that knowing that some of them were Jews (or all of them except for Christian's character) made any difference whatsoever (except perhaps some commentary of the Christian's influence over the Jews or some such thing). Perhaps there was some hidden message from the Director that I am just not getting.  I did take note that the movie had an Asian hooker, a Black security guard, a Christian psychopath, a WASP bride, and a bunch of Jewish bumbleheads totally out of their element. Haven't quite got all that together yet, but while I get the Jewish 'out of element' comedy, the Asian hooker and Black security guard didn't seem to me to enhance the comedic side of this black comedy.I believe that in the hands of the Coen brothers I think this modern take on the Brothers Karamazov by Dostoyevsky could have been a real descent into hell and a future requirement when studying ethics or psychology. It is unfortunate that the blood bath took precedence to pander to the mass expectations or for quick and easy acting and filming. I hope that one day it is remade without all the hysterics and swearing, perhaps limiting the deaths of the guys themselves and instead exploring the mental intricacies that were so promising at the beginning of the movie and at the end of the movie!

In other words, a movie that desperately needs to exist. And be seen.A bizarre combo protein-shake of black comedy, thriller and horror show, this is one of those Slow Saturday Night cult films that the weirdo clerk behind the counter is always personally recommending for those customers who are kind of like his pals.Very Bad Things is a film that plays out like a worse-case scenario. One of those movies that puts a group of relative people in a situation where everything that can possibly go wrong... does. Hopefully, with results that translate to a good movie.I found the movie to work on multiple levels. As an angry, aggressive, and assertive male-bonding comedy. As a thriller. As a white-knuckle, nail-biting action film. As a nightmare.Writer/Director Peter Berg remarks he came up with the idea for this movie when he was at a bachelor party and saw the rowdy and over-the-top behavior from a lot of the other guests. These guys were looking for trouble, he said. What would happen if they found it? More than they could handle.The movie is all-over-the-map, but I like that about it. Berg sets up some cynical suburbanites and their rowdy behavior and puts them in several life-or-death situations, which despite what many say, is thrilling to watch.Christian Slater gives the strongest performance as the devil-may-care Robert Boyd, a man who seems to have no moral threshold. We never doubt his actions for a second. Slater knows how to play this character as plays him to the hilt.Daniel Stern plays his usual nebbish. From the City Slickers movies, the Home Alone movies and all his others, he's appropriately nervous and uneasy--especially after what's occurring right now. There's are massive murders bobbing up and the body count is still rising.Cameron Diaz is also effective doing an evil turn on the wedding-obsessed loon she was in My Best Friend's Wedding as a woman who doesn't care about anything else but having her big day. As far as she's concerned, the guests and the groom are secondary. She nitpicks and she bullies and berates. Many guys see this as the epitome of the woman who's about to have her big day.Jon Faverau isn't as money as he's been in other roles, but maybe that's because he's supposed to be the straight man. He's a little too straight. Too stiff. You kind of wish they had spiced him up some more. He appears to just be in shock and going along with the flow most of the time, like a tag-along.The movie plays out as a dark comedic thriller and at times a morality tale. What I like the most is the anarchy of the film and the performance of Christian Slater and especially the different ways the men and women in the movie react to him.Watch for his scene with Tripplehorn when they go one-on-one. The homages to Good Fellas and Reservior Dogs are cute and memorable too.Like I said before, this is a must-see for anyone who hates generic, paint-by-numbers movies. If this sounds like your cup of tea (and it damn well should), you're someone after my own heart.

My friend warned me it was really, really sick, but I never expected this. SO funny and SO sick. It's beyond anything I've ever seen. It's the kind of movie you love, even though you know you shouldn't. You can almost feel the desensitization as you're laughing at Christian Slater getting his head bashed in with a coat rack. I love the man, but that was just funny. Or as you choke on your Pepsi laughing as Daniel Stern is sandwiched between two cars. It is sick, gruesome humor, but it's SO funny. In short, don't watch if you don't already consider yourself a fan of black comedy, and after you watch this, you'll see what black comedy REALLY is.The plot is basically a bunch of guys celebrating one of their buddies getting married. An accident happens concerning a prostitute ordered by Boyd (Christian Slater)and it just gets worse from there. Slater as Boyd is one of the most psychotic characters in a movie you'll ever see. The scary thing is, he rationalizes each death, and you can really see his point. Slater is a VERY convincing psycho, let me tell you that. Great performances given also by Jeremy Piven, Daniel Stern, Leland Orser and Jon Favreau. But what was really brilliant was Cameron Diaz as the bride from hell. If you love black comedy, take it to the next level with Very Bad Things. You won't be sorry.

I was wrong, I actually ended up liking the movie.  It's about a group of men who were life long friends who all live in Los Angeles (do all movies have to take place in L.A.?) and one of them is having an impending wedding to the self absorbed 'bride from hell' played by Cameron Diaz.  The guys go to the ultimate bachleor party and hire a prostitute only to have one of them accidently kill her.  They all clean up the grisly mess they left behind and try hard to keep it a secret.  One funny scene after another and worst comes to worst when they all turn against each other and end up killing anyone who gets in their way.  Very Bad Things is one of the very best dark comedies I have ever seen.  Though it shouldn't be viewed by anyone under 16, though.  My favorite part was when Daniel Stern drives to the gas station and his kids were screaming for Whizzers, and gets all paranoid that the cops are onto them.  I know this movie got bad reviews from critics, however is actually great and has a lot of laughs for those who are into dark comedy.  I wonder whatever happened to Daniel Stern?  I also enjoyed Christian Slater in this movie, too.  Very Bad Thing was almost like a live-action version of South Park.

It is also one of the funniest films I've seen in a very long time. The Farrelly brothers have been put to shame through the dark humor of director Peter Berg and the great cast. This can be a depressing and hard-to-watch film at times, but it is absolutely hilarious.Let me begin my review by saying that I love this movie. It slaps us in the face with several themes we'd really rather not think about and forces us to for an opinion on situations we'll hopefully never have to encounter. The central theme explored in the movie is Karma, the concept that what goes around comes around. The guys go to Vegas for a bachelor party that goes horribly wrong, and they all end up paying for it in different ways. Christian Slater's character, with his outrageous justifications for their nasty acts, comes as the highpoint of the exaggerated comedy. And yet, it is surely no drama, in the sense of melodrama at least. Rather, it's just a detached, furious account of bizarrely interesting but fatal situations of, up 'till this point, people who've never encountered such fearful, life-altering experiences. Combined with Berg's energetic direction and, overall, impressive, convincing, intense performances, the whole thing is just ashamedly entertaining. It just is! It's dark and it's twisted. It's ugly, for sure. To experience life outside the bubble, go ahead and give this one a shot. The acting is superb and the plot is just ridiculous! Overall rating 8 out of 10.

I know I am missing a few pairs, and with the exception of the last one, most of these similar concept movies came out within months of each other. And, now, I realized two movies I loved separately years ago, actually came out ONE DAY apart at the Toronto International Film Festival Very Bad Things & A Simple Plan. (9/11/98 and 9/12/98 respectively.) Now, like the other pairs, the tone and script are different, but the theme remains the same. Both Very Bad Things & A Simple Plan had bad events happen up front and snowball into complete chaos. I loved both and even though A Simple Plan was better overall, Very Bad Things was still thoroughly enjoyable. A Vegas bachelor party that's really not innocent to begin with abruptly halts thanks to one of the men accidentally killing a prostitute. Despite no foul play, the men, some reluctantly, agree to cover up the death&#x85;until moments later, it gets even more complicated. And never lets up from there.Sounds like I can also throw The Hangover in the pair-game above making this a trilogy of sorts, but The Hangover, though somewhat similar in theme, came out more than a decade later.This is one dark comedy, like super dark. Gruesome, humorous and downright mean, you kinda have to take a ride with these bad men as they try to live with themselves after what seemingly could have been easily avoided. But, that's the comedy part &#x96; it wouldn't be much of a movie if they did the right things. And Very Bad Things sounds so much cooler.Sometimes funny, mostly shocking, Very Bad Things is definitely a movie to see and not take too seriously.***Final thoughts About 15 years ago, my roommate loved this movie. For reasons still unknown. So we had to buy it on DVD and man, did he wear the bleep out of it. We must've watched it 20+ times.

In fact, I probably haven't seen this for 13 years now. It did hold up, for the most part, even though I think I granted it 10/10 stars back then compared to the 8/10 today.

The ensemble acting must have been very hard to do, and it's done amazingly well. Film editing is right up there. Photography very good too. Directing had to be good.The weakest link is the story, and it's not bad. It just gets too far beyond suspension of belief at times to function 100%. It skates a very thin line between reality, the blackest of comedy, and merciless satire. A few scenes do not really work and one of them is the burial scene. Some of the plot twists just go too far into implausibility even to function as satire.I like the thematic material best, despite the story weaknesses. I called these young people yuppies, but there is no doubt another generation name for them. Yuppie is an older term. The point of the movie is their values, their thought processes, their spiritual and emotional resources (really the lack of them and the problems with them). The writing basically lays them bare without mercy. There is little or no sympathy for any of them, none that I can see, and their essential shallowness and emptiness comes to the fore. Their inability to think straight is evident, their devotion to good times, and their shallow pleasures. They know there is something more but it is like they're stunted mentally and can't reach it. The very last scenes show this metaphorically via the fundamental childishness of these adults, and they are mixed in with their children and are themselves children.The basic theme of the movie is the childishness of these supposed adults. Even the way they talk about how to look at their own children shows a lack of knowledge about how to be a parent. It is as if they have to learn it from a psychology book. Even the swearing is an adoption of language from black people that makes them feel more real and genuine or grownup or tough than they really are. We see them all falling apart, except for the women who seem more focused. And the bride to be is set on marriage, no matter what.This is fundamentally a very serious movie done in a satirical vein that sometimes doesn't gel, but that doesn't detract from its overall impact. What these people do to each other physically can be taken as what real people are doing figuratively or emotionally.

I remember when I first watched this film at the cinema, I didn't find it particularly disturbing. Violence in the movies was fun back then (thanks, Quentin). Things began to get arguable when Boyd kills Lois and Michael. But not because he kills them, but because it was unnecessary. And still there was nothing wrong with the survivors. OK, it's unkind not to inform the police of a homicide you know of, but, hey, they got a marriage to do!That's the point, this is what the entire movie is all about. Will. How willful are you? Boyd says it, This is the opportunity for a self exploration. Actually dialogues are very revealing, don't be fooled by the comedy, it is all there in front of you. Boyd again &#x96; You love, and you protect what you love. Purpose. Reward. Laura &#x96; 27 years, for all of my life I've been focused only on this very day, and nothing is gonna ruin it!. Micheal &#x96; That flash of absolute, perfect, pure energy, that moment, that's what I'm looking for. That's how they are. The end justifies the means. Like some amateur army generals calculating collateral. Boyd (who, being mad, is the only one who speaks the truth) tells you &#x96; It's a war. A war. This is a war film.The comedy? Well, this is the truly interesting bit. As for a starter, the comedy in this story is of the grotesque kind. And real life IS grotesque. Every day. So when you encounter a grotesque movie you well possibly be in front of a good one. But in the present case comedy has a way more crucial role. It is the great trick the director plays on us.Far from diminishing the gravity of the matter, comedy multiplies it, makes it flow out of the screen and fall right upon us. Comedy exerts the function of questioning us. It had been a drama, it'd been easy to take sides, the seriousness of the setup would have warned you, then you'd been ready at the turning points of the story, when ethical dilemmas are posed, to take the right stand. But since it's a comedy, you switch into auto and settle for a hour and spare of just plain, good fun. And there comes the ambush - bear with me now, because it's a bit puzzling &#x96; when the carachters are faced with a moral dilemma, you are asked to deal with it along with them, BUT, in order to do so, you, as a spectator of a comedy, need to solve a prior moral dilemma &#x96; Should I deal with their moral dilemma even if this means to stop having fun? Should I judge their actions and, as I've already guessed they're gonna do the wrong thing, loathe them for the rest of the movie, having no fun at all? If you watched it (as I did, and did in DVD and on TV too) till the end, then your answer was no. And, honestly, we had some issues just with the first death, the prostitute, from then on we didn't even care. There was a goal &#x96; having fun &#x96; and a downside &#x96; sympathizing with a bunch of monsters. We accepted collateral.If you ask me, no, it isn't as bad as burying a dead prostitute in the desert or killing your friends. It's more like having a little taste of how does it feel like to be an amateur army general, decide what to get and what to loose, an experience of self exploration.I don't know whether all this was deliberate on the party of the director. If not, even better.Or worse.And now tell me you don't shiver.

I saw that Christian Slater was in it, as well as Jon Favreau, and it's supposedly a dark comedy. So I like Christian Slater, and Favreau is a likable sort of actor, So I pick it up and take it home and toss it into my DVD player. When it starts, I had high hopes for this movie. The movie is based on the premise of a bachelor party. It did not take long until I was cutting the movie off and thinking Why did I sit there and watch that? And that question has actually plagued my mind since the credits started rolling. All I can come up with is a>I didn't realize how dark the descriptors were talking, and b> they didn't have a CPU in blockbuster where I could consult IMDb. I was severely underwhelmed by the movie. Without getting into spoiler territory, very bad things happen, which you should really expect because of the apt title. But if the people that made this film really and truly felt like giving it an appropriate title, They would have named this movie Very Bad Thing, because that is EXACTLY what this film is.

During the party a big mistake happens and in order to cover the mistake up bad stuff begins to happen. It's basically how if someone catches onto your lies, you lie some more and more until the whole thing becomes bigger than it should. Most of everything turn for the worse when paranoia, hatred, guilt and psychotic stuff begins to happen. A lot of the aspect of the film is downright ridiculous at times and the character reactions is over the top at times, but besides that it's a dark comedy that is worth checking out.

I hate being a teacher.So, the story of Very Bad Things is as simple as its title implies good people do bad things. Namely, murder and maim each other. A bachelor party ends up with an accidentally dead hooker. But hey! It's Vegas! Just bury her in the desert. It takes five minutes of excellent character actors Jon Favreau, Jeremy Piven, Leland Orser and Daniel Stern screaming at each other in exactly the way upstanding middle aged men would in the aftermath of manslaughter to set the actual tone of the movie. I say five minutes, and you hear a short period but in the movie world, five minutes is an eternity.We'd been led astray, with goofy soccer mom Lois (Jeanne Tripplehorn) and her camcorder making us think this was a comedy.I signed up for a comedy. The poster told me so. The cast implied it so! And don't get me wrong, I'm one of those annoying jerks in theatres who laughs at everything from punch lines to zombies getting a croquet mallet in the head to Austen lasses getting rejected at a dance. My favorite comedies include Heathers and American Beauty.I also get wet for movies that portray human behavior accurately &#x96; see two favorites above. So Peter Berg (wrote and directed) totally nailing how confused these suburbanites are after unexpected and repercussion- full death is beautiful. The actors are spot on. Each grabs the personality of their character and whines, cries, yells, throws punches exactly as they should. And even though Jon Favreau's character is the protagonist, Christian Slater's character is the one directing action among the friends. That is, he picks up on how not to get caught by police and wrangles his four friends along.What ensues is a cacophonous clean up, more murders and side stepping.All brilliant. It's just not funny. It's just not good watching. The weird part is that, this easily could have been a comedy. The situations are ludicrous, the soundtrack is ironic and upbeat, Christian Slater and Cameron Diaz's characters are perfect cartoons for serial killing! The rest of the cast and the writing is just, well, too good. Not to insult Slater or Diaz's jobs here &#x96; they are absolutely my favorite part of the whole thing. In fact, Diaz actually steals the damn show. Her 10-12 minutes of total screen time as a bridezilla who is not going to let serial murder get between her and her perfect wedding, are priceless and the best I've ever seen her. She snaps between lovey-dovey and furious in half a second. Not just with her face, with her whole body! She acts with everything she has! You can almost smell her overpriced perfume she's so good.Since she is the lady who epitomizes the blas√© tretment of murder, it is also Diaz who holds the moralistic covering up your murders is bad In the end the camera stays on her romping facial expressions as she cleans the house, now orphaned children, gazes at her maimed husband and his maimed best friend and goes a little Jim Carey running into the middle of the street to fall over. Goofy beyond reckoning? Absolutely. She gives me my humor! Berg's last gift is the use of a wide scope lens in a super close up of her now-deranged face, blowing her cartoonish face right up to redeemably funny proportions and then pans out to the stratosphere, leaving our adorable idiot squirming in the middle of the road. Over all, a little too good a rendition of normal people doing bad things.

This isn't quite as consistent as a pre-helicopter accident John Landis movie, but it has the best first half of any 90s comedy - free, wild, vicious, and delighted to be out from under Reagan-Bush era social constraints. Cripples, drugs, whore sex, murder, race jokes. There's no Tom Hanks at this bachelor party.A mostly disappointing third act manages to wrap up it up in the right spirit. Altogether maybe my favorite movie of 1998. I saw this in an audience of women, many of whom walked out, I guess because Cameron Diaz plays a bitch princess just a little too accurately for some people. Diaz isn't in it much, but she's better here than she often is, and while I don't know her personally, she plays a shallow, selfish brat more convincingly than she does a cute, likable ingenue.The rest of the cast, with one exception, is fine. I mean, sure, Christian Slater's part would have been better played by Vince Vaughan; but Slater's no hack. Leland Orser's weird as hell, Daniel Stern is reliable as always, John Favreau is a straight man for the ages. And Kobe Tai is the best bachelor party stripper since Nick the Dick. But the exception is Piven. He's not fine. He's a god. It's Piven's film; we're all just watching it.Jeremy Piven was born to play an underachieving lout in movies (as he was born to play an overachieving lout on TV), and Peter Berg makes the best cinematic use to date of this wonderful performer. His manic, hookercidal, fratricidal characterization here is a high-water mark for the crazy buddy role. I'm gonna do this and then we're gonna go to Fatburger has become a boys'-night-out mantra. This film effectively exorcises the demon of PCU and places Piven at the forefront of wack-job talent.It was one of the great injustices of Hollywood that after this one failed to perform at the box office, Berg didn't direct another movie for five years. Now, after a couple of crowd-pleasing kids' movies, let's hope he writes something this dark again. "}{"Title":"The film challenges your sense of humour and your patience with the most graphic of content in a manipulative but clever manner.","Date":"25 October 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Thriller","Review":" People will like this film and people will hate it; I wonder how many people will have made the link between Very Bad Things and 'very bad film(s)' when talking to one another about this film. Very Bad Things isn't anything terrible but it isn't anything particularly excellent; it doesn't excel in some areas but is extremely effective and distressing in others and I frequently found my self saying out loud during the film Tell him to shut up! or Quick, do that now that this has happened! Very Bad Things is a film that challenges your sense of humour; I am under no illusion when I say you will find out a great deal about yourself when you watch this film in terms of what makes you laugh. Very Bad Things is a test, it's an experiment as to what you will laugh at and what you won't maybe you'll even find yourself laughing and think afterwards that wasn't funny, it was sick but you've already laughed. I'm sure that when Dr. Strangelove was made in the 1960s and dared everyone to laugh at nuclear war, it felt refreshing but in a taboo sort of a way and this was the feeling I got when watching Very Bad Things; would the content that's being put across be that good if it wasn't played for laughs? The scene in which they have to shut the hotel attendant in the en suite for seeing a dead body and their reactions to him dying a slow and painful death is pretty funny albeit you're laughing with your eyebrows down. That old phrase 'the only things that are funny in life is other people's misfortune' is very true here. But there is more to the film than gore and murder when it comes to the comedy. The 'clean up' montage where we see them buying saws and such, cleaning out the bathroom, someone slipping on one of the pools of blood, seeing the bloody handprints the attendant made on the walls and mirrors as he hopelessly ravaged around in agony and the forming of the body parts when they need to bury the evidence are all examples of material you can look at without having to self censor and yet remain challenging to your sense of humour.I think Very Bad Things has a deeper message than you'd first think. The Western (or should that be American?) idea is that you have a bachelor party before you're married, a sort of 'one last feeling of freedom' and one that involves sex with prostitutes, hard drugs and lots of stupid gambling (a flutter on a football match might be alright but Roulette and Craps is madness) but this is the way we are led to think; sort of like society demands we do it like society demands nightclubs should be the first point of call come Friday night, that sex with strangers is a good idea and getting drunk and smoking is what you need to do to 'fit in'. Very Bad Things challenges this as it puts them in the situation society demands (through clever montages of Las Vegas) and then flips them on their head's when the film's initial event occurs thanks to a mishap with a prostitute. Very Bad Things also has its characters living in a 'perfect' Westernised (or Americanised?) neighbourhood with picket fences, freshly cut lawns and 4x4's for the family &#150; these people are a product of the American Dream and are consequently continuing to submit to societies demands by going through with the maddest bachelor party they can cook up. It's this sort of content that drove Patrick Bateman mad in American Psycho and it's this sort of mentality films like Blue Velvet and Pleasantville utilise for their respective stories.Very Bad Things is a film that although isn't for everyone, still remains not for everyone even when you look at its demographic group. Some will find this hilarious, someone else of the same age and background will hate it and if you can look past the unfortunate fact that it's the Jew who 'cracks' first and that Laura Garrety (Cameron Diaz) is the one character in film history who is in the greatest need of a slap, you ill find a very dark, very well executed film that challenges your watching ability and ability to laugh at something you should laugh at.

It is in some ways refreshingly dark but in others not that far removed from the usual Hollywood comedies. Its got a very black & surreal edge & the dark deeds & ever more ridiculous & inevitably doomed actions of the guys is fun to watch.The cast are on the whole good, Jon Favreau & Jeremy Piven are excellent as usual. They really give a realistic portrayal of your average bloke caught up in this nightmare situation. Daniel Stern is also great as the tortured moral centre to the group, his scene when he breaks down at a petrol station is one of the highlights of the movie. Apart from Diaz the other players are nothing remarkable. The one weak link in this movie, & the main thing which lets it down is Christian - I look a bit like a young Jack Nicholson so will copy him in every film I'm in - Slater! You should really never see the mechanics of acting in a movie but with Slater this is all you see! You are so aware of the fact that he is performing, he never convinces as the character, content to be a Nicholson impersonator rather than an actor & this is a major let down as he is a driving force for many of the events in Very Bad Things.As mentioned Sterns character is the moral ground in this film & works well, but the movie does fall short on other occasions when it appears that the director/writer is implying a more serious message. For example a man having sex with a hooker intercut with the rest of the gang watching wrestling & playfighting. What is he trying to say? A link between violence & sex? Indeed this film is totally moralistic! If you do a bad thing then bad things will happen to you appears to be the message. It would have been darker & funnier if Slaters character had got away with it, walked away scott free at the end of the film whilst everyone else around him is either dead, disabled or mad!So overall this is worth a watch not least to see the fine 'adult performance artiste' Kob√© Tai in a mainstream movie! She isn't on screen for long though, & this is probably the first time she's had to get to grips with such a small part!  Very Bad Things has some funny moments mixed with a very dark tone. It is slightly let down by a certain actors performance & the fact that it's not quite as funny or subversive as it should be/thinks it is. "},{"Title":"Misunderstood","Date":"9 July 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Thriller","Review":"  Very Bad Things is a film about five guys who, more or less, kill two people and bury them in the desert.  Bad things to do, to be sure.  But that's not really what the movie is about, and those who criticize it aren't getting it.What makes Very Bad Things a good movie is that it's not about the surface story, but about how five ordinary guys make a horrible choice and then have to live with it.  As Christian Slater's character Boyd would say, once you get past the horror of what these guys have done, what are you left with? Paranoia, anger, regret and betrayal.  And more horror.  Jon Favreau is good, but more or less just serves as one of the guys that the main story goes through.  It's the performances of Christian Slater, Jeremy Piven and especially Daniel Stern that really make this film.  Even the critics who blasted (and therefore misunderstood) this film, like Roger Ebert, conceed that Slater's performance is worthy of praise.  Piven and Stern play the brothers who are pretty much at opposite ends of the spectrum as far as their feelings about the incident.  Obviously, Piven started the whole thing in motion and therefore doesn't want to be caught.  Stern, who I've never seen in a dramatic role until this film, plays the straight edge who wants to call the police immediately and who is especially wracked by guilt afterwards.Spoilers ahead.  The scene where Stern's character gets gas and has to go into the station to buy Whizzers is the film's best scene.  It is brilliantly written, directed, executed, and acted by Stern.  The arguing that Stern and Piven perform throughout, especially the evening Stern dies is incredible and almost seems genuine.  Then, after Piven's character kills Sterns', the array of guilt he displays is marvelously acted, as well. And, again, Slater's character is just about the most evil normal guy you'll ever see.Again, Favreau is getting married (to Cameron Diaz), and that serves as the framework for the story.  Diaz is used mainly for comic relief in what is otherwise a dismal and horrid story.  Sure, the notion of a fanatic bride-to-be is somewhat cliched, but Diaz does a hell of a job with it. Maybe the film would have gone over a little better with a little more fanaticism from her.There comes a point in this film where I feel it kind of nosedives, that being when Slater's character turns on Favreau for the insurance money. This action of Slater's character is not characteristic of the person the film had painted up to that point, of being cool, calm and collected, avoiding messing things up.  Out of the blue, he tries to kill Favreau for some insurance money.  I guess that the film could have continued to nosedive from that point, but surprisingly, does not.  The rest continues on in the same spirit it had up to that point,  which makes me think that a better way for Boyd to die could have been conceived.Basically, in the end, everyone is punished.  Especially the Diaz character as the film ends.  A lifetime of punishment that would probably be worse than execution or a life sentence is presented for her.  It's a great way to end this film by Peter Berg.Very Bad Things is a black comedy, I guess, or is supposed to be.  Like most black comedies (think Fargo), you're never actually laughing at what is happening.  You're laughing at what certain characters, including bad ones, say at times.  It's a light way to present a very dark, disturbing or twisted story.  And it was done exactly as it should have been, in my opinion.  Some say this film would have been better if it had been played straight.  Why???  With such a plot, a film like this has to make you laugh sometimes and remind you constantly that it's just a movie and the filmmakers aren't taking it too seriously.  To criticize people (Ebert) for finding this film funny is unfair.  No one in their right mind is laughing at the killing.  But the characters are pretty funny when they're not killing, kind of like the guys in Fargo.Lighten up, people, and make SOME attempt to understand where these filmmakers were coming from.

This movie gets two stars, even though dark comedy is definitely something I like.I demoted it because it's missing a few things. I respectfully disagree with the folks who contend it's a complete disaster, worst movie of all time, etc. It's not that. It can be entertaining in parts, but the audience has to be right. It's not for everyone, and if you don't like dark comedy I have to wonder why you'd be watching it. The title gives away what the film is about.First of all, I liked the plot. It's nice and complicated, everybody is betraying everybody else.But the film missed things that are significant and important. **SPOIILERS**A critical element to the plot of a movie like this, is that the protagonists should be like Charlie's-Angels Bad Guys Most of them are good-natured but on the wrong path, and then one or two of them are rotten-to-the-core. The film does that here, with Christian Slater as the deep-dark villain, but then you need to have scenes where the other folks are examining what is becoming of them. That's vital. Without that, we can't identify with them.When Very Bad Things does this, without exception it's a prelude to some screaming fit, and then again without exception the scene leads up to yet another grisly demise. When you do that religiously, as Peter Berg did, the movie becomes predictable. Toward the end I was starting to think here we go again. That seems like a real insignificant complaint, but I believe without that predictability the film could have avoided the Worst Movie Ever comments like we see above.Another thing that could have been improved is that I didn't identify with people as they were seduced to the dark side. The plans they were  making were just plain silly. Lower the bodies into the car from the balcony of a hotel? Sure. What time of the morning is this? Anybody ever explore a really nice hotel at three in the morning? It's not a ghost town, and nobody's lowering any bodies into cars from balconies, okay?So on my very worst day, I wouldn't have begun to entertain the ideas these folks cooked up, even with my ethics betrayed and my moral profile seduced. The plans they made were just stupid. I hate to say it, but the first I know what you did last summer did this thing somewhat right. At least, better than it was done here.Now that said, I liked the ending. I was hoping a car would hit Cameron Diaz, and when it almost happened I wondered if the filmmakers anticipated what I was thinking and were deliberately teasing me with it. It seemed to be a message that there's a divine force at work here, and it will make sure until the end of time that this selfish bitch will languish forever in the fate she so richly deserved.

It was shot very contemporary and had a good plot that kept your attention. Something about hinting the end of the film at the beginning of it really drags you in there and keeps your attention (American Beauty for example.) We have an awesome cast of male roles wound up and then topped off with Diaz as the obsessed soon-to-be-wife. She really makes this flick worth watching with her catty remarks and constant b*tching. I enjoyed this film to the highest extent for the simple fact that Peter really took a shot at something sacred; marriage. Death, destruction, sex, power, money, drugs and lying unfortunately seem to be a part of American culture today. O yea, and war. This film exploits that in a somewhat comical way. It isn't brought to us like Sex, Lies and Videotapes. It isn't brought to us like American History X. It isn't brought to us like Saving Private Ryan.

Jon Favreau stars as soon-to-be husband whose friends take him to Sin City for a raunchy, sex, drugs and alcohol filled bachelor party (as if there's any other kind).  Things go bad, the prostitute is killed, and so it is decided and planned mostly by Christian Slater the body be disposed of and the whole thing forgotten.That's when the movie really takes off, and it's powered by Slater's fast-talking, sickly logical and self-help book reading Boyd, who can pretty much sell anything, if not by his savvy then by force.  The friends start panciking, led by a frantic Daniel Stern.  Peter Berg knows how to control his cast, and though the subject matter at times seems more grave than funny, some scenes are just too well-done to not laugh, especially when the cast turns on each other and is allowed to vent full blast.Cameron Diaz's turn as a self-absorbed control-freak is a welcome deviation from her generally likeable roles - she makes the character her own and is vicious, demanding, and often hilariously over-the-top.  The rest of the cast does well with the material and Christian Slater is in top form as the maniacal, lowbrow, and often very funny lead in the entire debacle. While Very Bad Things certainly won't appeal to people who don't like their comedies to depend on severed body parts for laughs, fans of black comedy will appreciate the film for the most part.  Peter Berg's direction may lull at times and instead concentrate on the gore and deliver an unsatisfying ending, but any director who can get chuckles from vicious murders is good, albeit crude.7 out of 10  "},{"Title":"Cool film, cool actors, cool plot.

It delivers more  than nominally as a suspenseful yarn, but its tension is more derived from the realm of dread than that of exhilarating thresholds and heart-pounding precipices. Imagine your worst 'final-exam-and-never-once-made-it-to-class' nightmare, and add a double-digit exponent and you'll arrive at roughly the emotional pitch of this horrid tale. Remember or imagine a dream in which you embody, say, Abraham Lincoln in the balcony at Ford's Theatre. In other words, you are magically aware of impending doom.

Having attended more than one wild bachelor party, I could easily put myself in this situation.

After the prostitute is killed at the bachelor party, things seem to be OK for the guys.  They are a little shaken up, but that is to be expected.

You never really get away with killing another human.Without going into too much detail, I think that the rest of the movie is fairly reasonable in what would happen if 4 average guys are pushed around by a raving lunatic.  Famous last words 'It seemed to be the thing to do at the time'.  Not an actual quote, just the mood of the picture.Boyd (Christian Slater) is the ideal soul-less yuppie pervert.  Great casting.  Jeremy Piven is his usual wonderful character actor, very sympathetic.  Cameron Diaz comes off a little unbelievable, but I've seen women get pretty nuts around the 'big day'.Nonetheless, I will not give this film a very high rating because it might encourage people to go see it who would not 'get it'.

It's a dark comedy with one of my favorite actresses, Cameron Diaz, and the guy from Swingers. I popped it in the VCR to find an opening that portrayed Diaz as the bitchy, pushy, and all around lovable soon to be wife of Kyle, the character played by Favreau. It made me laugh and went downhill from there. Perhaps it's because I come from a small town or something, but these guys are getting a little too wild, in an unrealistic, obnoxious way, at the bachelor party. The fact that Slater's character was so nonchalant about killing an innocent guard reminded me a little too much of his character in Heathers. Now that I think about it, everything he did in this movie reminded me of his character in Heathers. Well, at least it made for a good movie once. The way that the characters were so fickle about how they felt about going from innocent suburbanites to killers got old fast. Diaz's ability to kill a guy she finds annoying to supposedly better her wedding day was the real icing on the cake. Who thought that two closeted murderers would find love together? Small world, huh? Well, the movie winds down to a bit where everyone has a horrible life and Diaz is pushed to a nervous breakdown, the only believable acting I saw at that sitting.

It's stupid that they are advertising it as If you liked Something About Mary, you'll Love... they are both tasteless comedies, but VBT makes SAM look like a Disney movie in comparison. Yeah, there's disgusting stuff in SAM but it's all vulgar sex-related humor, but in VBT the humor is in the vein (har!) of Mia Wallace getting the hypo of adrenaline jabbed into her heart in Pulp Fiction. Hey, I like that kind of humor, so I liked this movie, though the misogynism got a little old. I rented it because a friend said he admired the filmmakers for making such an incredibly nasty, mean-spirited mainstream movie, and it was an OK movie worth a rental. It seems like most of the reviewers here either loved it or despised it (YOU BETTER STOP SELLING IT) but I would give it, like, a B minus. Christian Slater's self-actualization psycho act got old after a while but the other actors were good, and I think Cameron Diaz is overrated in general but I really liked her performance in this, she was great as the spoiled stressed-out bride who crosses the line and goes totally psycho (This is MY DAY!!!) It's also one of those 'what-would-you-do-if-it-happened-to-you' type movies. If I were one of the guys I would have cleaned up the coke, put away the booze, and called for an ambulance and the police right away- they were all so rich they probably could have found good sleazy lawyers who could have gotten them off with a slap on the wrist at most.

My mate had the same view, that you have to forget about morals, the sometimes unadventurous script, etc. and just sit back, relax and enjoy the couple of hours of great entertainment.The story wasn't serious and I think we were lucky to have an audience that did laugh at the many funny bits. I can understand that if you got the wrong type of audience it may be hard to see this film in the right light.Normally, when I see a comedy in the cinema I am not usually the kind of person to laugh out loud. I just seem to smile a lot. In this film though, I was almost wetting myself with laughter. Maybe, it was because you weren't really supposed to laugh at some bits. I even laughed when they walked in the bathroom at the beginning and there was blood everwhere and it was quite a disturbing scene. I did tend to laugh more at the really disturbing parts.Watch this movie for what it is - a film in which people are really funny doing some 'Very Bad Things'.

I often get shocked by movies that I don't know much about going into it, but being shocking doesn't make this film any good. This movie is very very bad, despite having some pretty funny lines and scenes. The cast is great, and they all give some adequate performances, except when they over-act a little at times. I had difficulty understanding what the entire point of the movie was. It was just so brutally twisted. The plot kept going around in circles, and it was extremely irritating listening to five men screaming at each other for a couple of hours. It was terribly disjointed, and most importantly, it had nowhere to go in the end. I guess the ending was actually quite good, but it really had no other choice. I wouldn't call it a complete waste of time and money, but I would rather see something else.

In fact at times it's disturbingly violent ( in a very direct way, unlike for instance the much more abstractly violent scenes in Tarantino's movies), and makes one wonder if it's really a comedy. But on the other hand as the story evolves, it becomes so absurd, that it can be nothing else than some sort of a comedy. It's quite an entertaining study of what people might do, to save themselves from situations that become more and more extreme. At times it's not a pleasant movie at all. The music is quite good, and adds a strange feel to some of the scenes.

I have to admit, however, that I did watch Stag first before I saw Very Bad Things, so this is a very biased view.  The difference between the two except from the obvious one being a tragic drama and the other being a black comedy is the characters.I found it hard to symphatise with any of the characters in Very Bad Things.  None of the characters are sympathetic enough so that the audience can get involved in the storyline.  It felt like I was, well, I was watching a movie of people who have done...very bad things.  On the other hand, Stag has at least two characters that you can sympathise with and feel sorry that they got trapped in the deadly situation.However, most importantly, Stag does push me to ask the question what if that happened to me?, and maintain the suspense until the end of the movie. I do, however, found the ending of both movies to be quite good, in their own terms. Very Bad Things did have its potential but unfortunately, I don't give a damn for any of the characters in it.

I agree that the film is far more bloody than it probably needs to be - you're left repulsed by the actions of the bachelor party participants.However, it is funny in parts - I personally saw amusing aspects in someone slipping in blood, falling on a coffin, going berserk at annoying children demanding treats, and ending your life crushed against a minivan - other people didn't.  I didn't find anything funny about lingering shots of the dead prostitute lying naked in a pool of blood - way too gratuitous. Carving up and burying the bodies took up to much screen time as well, slowing the momentum of the film too much.Yes, all the main characters are annoying - I wondered whether the director wanted us to feel empathy with any of them and then realised that he probably wanted us to loathe them all.  The shrieking and histrionics of the men got on my nerves and it was a pleasure to see many of them dispatched.The ending is particularly effective - no redeemable characters and everyone gets what they deserve for their actions. Cameron Diaz does an excellent job of portraying the horror of being trapped in an unfortunate family situation in suburbia.If you're squeamish, dislike violence, want to feel empathy for the main characters and like happy endings don't bother with this film. Othewise, it has its moments and is different from the usual Hollywood pap in that it doesn't conform to the cliched movie experience or push the usual emotional buttons. Probably why many people have recoiled in horror from it - this round peg won't fit in the square hole.

Less self control, more is accepted within society.  Things are bleak.  Now, imagine a disease-ridden carcass of all that is grim, dark and sadistic. Imagine it being captured in a celuloid cell, and the prisoner name is Very Bad Things.Starting on the plain of innocence Laura (Cameron Diaz) and Kyle (Jon Favreau) making sure all the checks have been handled and sent.  The road to bliss awaits - right?  WRONG!  The bachelor party is calling from the depths of Hell, and it's all arranged by real-estate agent-cum-psycho Robert Boyd (Christian Slater).  Along with friends Adam (Stern), Charles (Orser) and Michael (Piven), the party hard philosophy is in full effect.  Gambling, drink, cocaine, room-trashing, and the small matter of a dead prostitute in the bathroom.  And once Boyd stabs a security guard with a corkscrew, events come to a head.  Paranoia sets into the gang once the bodies are buried and Boyd is willing to bury anyone who may jump ship and tell the police.The hysteria that is the backbone to the piece spreads like a virus to the audience, with Stern capturing the fear aspect head-on.  Slater's Nicholson-style escapades are superb, but nothing new; whilst Diaz holds all the surprises, playing the flipside of new character in My Best Friend's Wedding.  The script is fast, loud and at times grating.  But some scenes hit those furious home runs the bachelor party is fantastic (Slater talking about Self-Actualisation); and the grave digging scene is a scream.  Simply put - nothing remarkably new, but damn good black humour.  There may be no good in the film, but there certainly is no bad.

Let us assume from Robert's lack of soul, he was a chronic drug abuser (though it is only portrayed at the party). He displays anti-social characteristics. He is the catalyst for the events in the movie. He is greed and want, no matter what the cost. He is the only one not sorry for his actions (of course there is also Laura).Michael Berkow He represents jealousy. His character devels into the darkest reaches of Jealousy and ends up killing his brother over nothing.Adam Berkow He represent guilt and faith. He is so enveloped in his regret for the events he becomes paranoid. How many people in his shoes (guilty of some crime no matter how minor) have felt they were being watched and were going to get what they deserved.Charles Moore (I believe Charles was the groom. If I am mistaken just switch this comment with Kyle) He represented susceptibility to peer pressure. All through the movie he does what Laura says or what Robert says or what anyone says. He does what he is told and goes with the group. Not till the very end does he grow a backbone and do what HE thinks he should do.Kyle Fisher (I believe he was the loner. If not, switch with Charles' comment below.) He was the quiet one that hid in the background. Didn't really understand what was going on (His small breakdown when they were burying the original bodies).

What I found disturbing were the pathetic attempts at symbolism (for example, when Daniel Stern's character would rather die than part with his pristine white minivan)and the fact that a group of men at a bachelor party are meant to be taken by the audience as wholly representative of suburban decay. If this film was about women on the road accidentally murdering someone, it would be...Thelma and Louise and labelled as feminist or women-centred and dealing with the female experience.  Yes, Cameron Diaz's psychotic bride seems to epitomize the heavy-handed point Peter Berg is trying to convey, but her character does not seem to prove that she can play with the big boys (which is a patronizing concept in itself)as much as it re-enforces the limited stereoypes women must work within in order to be in film at all.Why am I focussing on this particular point, you may ask, when so many films are as sexist and narrow-minded as this one?  I am so disgusted with this film because it seems so smug and self-satisfied with its satirical status that it does not seem to realize that it is only recycling tired cliches with a lot of blood thrown on top. I have no problems with shock value, but not when it is unsubstantiated or unwarranted.The destruction of the suburban myth and the decay of American society (blah blah blah...just kidding) is an interesting and important theme to explore, but it must be done with more intelligence and more subtlety than this film. If you want to see a film that truly achieves what this film aspires to, rent Heathers, or even the fairy-tale Edward Scissorhands. If you want to see an exercise in obnoxious post-Tarantino (whose films I happen to enjoy very much)filmmaking, rent this film and time how long it takes you to either fall asleep or run away screaming - not in terror, but in embarrassment.

A couple of days prior to the wedding Fisher takes his friends to Vegas for a bachelor party. It starts out fine. Gambling, seeing the sights, talk over good times...then they get to the hotel room. Everybody gets either drunk, high or wasted in the hotel room. Then a shock goes over Fisher as a hooker shows up. She ends up going up to the bathroom and has sex with one of the guys. During sex she bangs her head on a towel rack and the back of it goes through her head killing her. Hearing the noise a hotel guard comes in the room and is fatally stabbed with a corkscrew by Fisher's friend Robert Boyd (Christian Slater). They then must plan to get the bodies hid and go on the rest of their lifes without it ever getting out. So that's what the rest of the movie is about. The days leading up to Fisher's marrage.As cheesy as the plot may sound it gets gripping at points. Plus unlike other movies that seem to be stupid plotted you cared for the characters. Christian Slater played a perfect villain who just wants to save his own butt and doesn't care about any others. Cameron Diaz being the sexy lady that she is made a great soon to be wife with her you love me don't you? line. She got the most credits but the guy who deserves them is Daniel Stern.

Funny in places but ultimately a sick film with the swearing and gore quotient to rival any Scorcese gangster pic. The premise itself is a very good one. Five guys going wild at a bachelor party run into a bit of trouble when one of them accidentally kills the stripper. It starts quite serious then the black comedy kicks in with the bodies piling up left, right and centre. Some of the gruesome deaths will leave you reeling. With the wedding rapidly approaching the five guys have to cover their tracks and hope their loved ones don't find out. The acting is pretty good on the whole with Jon Favreau, Jeremy Piven and Daniel Stern the standouts. Favreau is the groom and the cornerstone of the film whilst Piven and Stern are hilarious as two bickering Jewish brothers. Christian Slater is still trying to be the new Jack Nicholson and overplays it just a little too much. What of Cameron Diaz, I here you ask? Well she is very good in this film. Put it this way, when the final twist in the tale arrives she makes it believable which is no mean feat. This film is a good night out if you can stomach the killing and like your black comedy blacker than the ace of spades. To be brutally honest I left the cinema in a daze.

After naturally assuming that the voice was Adam's wife, Lois the camera slowly pans to his brother Michael as the source of all this gut-wrenching anguish.

Berg is just another actor who became self-deluded enough (i.e. even more so than your average self-deluded actor) to think that he can write/direct, too. He must have woken up one morning, thinking, I, Peter Berg, am the next Kubrick; I will show the world what talent lies dormant in me; I shall start gently, with a black comedy about murder among friends. Berg, who tried desperately to make a unique, clever cult movie, actually wrote a script that is a) often predictable, b) not funny, and c) makes too little sense characterization-wise, even for a comedy. The black humour - at best - brings out one or two mild smiles. Especially the last third loses itself in a great big jumble in which one predictable murder follows another. So it's no wonder then that the last scene, which is supposed to be so punch-line-hilarious, is right out of a very bad Police-Academy-type comedy. Berg's grasp of comedy is so shaky that at times (mostly in the 1st half) he wasn't sure which way the movie should go all-out black comedy or thriller/drama. Is it supposed to be funny that Diaz puts her wedding above all the murdering mayhem? Am I supposed to lose myself in a laughing fit over Tripplehorn chop-sokeying Slater and biting his balls? And do we really need to watch Stern play a hysteric for the 100th time? Still, the movie has enough going on not to be too dull. The direction is typical of an over-ambitious rookie with limited talent the hand-held camera shtick, and other tiresome stuff. The cast is hardly something to shout about; we've got - not one but two - actors who say sh instead of s, and a very bad Diaz. I think that at some point between the movie's release and the present, Berg has woken up one morning and thought, I'll be lucky if they let me direct a soap commercial; I am not Scorsese - I am Kiefer Sutherland.

Hehe, serves you right - a soupy romantic comedy this ain't. Although, granted, Aniston would have been much funnier than Diaz in this, the latter's offering turning out satisfactory nevertheless. Peter Berg, his directorial face disfigured with sardonic grin, sadistically shows us - without much restraint or sense of propriety - the ugliest aspects of human nature, particularly those of American white middle classes of a certain generation. He devours his entire chosen group of more or less obnoxious characters and projectile-vomits them out in delicious laugh-out-loud disgust, conducting the jaw-drop proceedings with assuredness of an accomplished film maker and the one endowed with a very bitter and evil sense of humour indeed - which, in my view, is paradoxically the film's greatest asset as well as it's biggest downfall. As I see it, the story would have worked better if it had been relieved of any humour at all - in fact, the way it plays itself out, one can almost see it as an American remake of some TRULY dark (albeit non existent) European or Asian original, sweetened up by malignant humour and over-hysterical megawatt performances, so making it Hollywood-compatible and palatable for average cinema-going, dollar-depositing audience in some stateside backwater. But then we would have had a different film, possibly a serious psycho-drama that's genuinely disturbing and truly harrowing to watch. Still, as it is, it's mordantly, brutally funny and pretty accurate. The entire cast seem to relish the opportunity to be mean, sick, twisted or deranged - Slater actually being the weakest link in the line up - and it's Jeanne Tripplehorn who steals the show in her few hilarious scenes, and Jeremy Piven who gives the most balanced performance among the main protagonists (and his fans get to see his naked butt). The whole film does actually feel like a labour of (evil) love brought to you by an entire crew itself totally wasted on coke - from the director himself downwards to the last cable boy on set - storming as it does through it's running time. And if the last parting shot of Diaz having a nervous breakdown in the middle of her own Wysteria Lane setting - existing in a life so different to the one her character had meticulously mapped out for herself - doesn't leave you in stitches with mean cackle, you really don't have any sense of wicked humour at all, and Lord Of The Rings should be just your measure. Great, eyepoking fun, of the most subversive kind. And a giant leap for American cinema in general, finally maturing enough to deal with it's own obsessions - namely, the issue of redemption, and the usual saccharine-laced idea that good always prevails over evil.

However, where the Farrelly's humour is more toilet than dark, Very Bad Things is the opposite, making tongue-in-cheek jokes about the disabled, prostitutes, both sexes, and murder. Starring Christian Slater and a manic Cameron Diaz it is a film probably for those of us with an acquired taste.The film revolves around the preparations for one couple's wedding. The wife-to-be Laura (Diaz) is obsessive, annoying, and screams a lot, wanting her wedding to be completely perfect. Kyle, her fianc√©e is more laid back but knows not to annoy her. His friends Robert (Slater), Charles, and brothers Michael and Adam decide to go to Vegas for the weekend before the wedding to indulge in gambling, drugs and sex before he is tied down. Kyle is reluctant, but Robert has a reputation for going to far. When a prostitute (Kobe Tai) is brought in for Kyle, he cannot betray his wife, but Michael decides he'll take a ride, and while in the act, in the bathroom, he accidentally kills her, impaling her head on a hook. While everyone panics, deciding to phone the cops, Robert takes control saying they should hide the body. When a hotel worker intervenes, Robert kills him too. The bodies are sawed to pieces and buried in the desert. They return home for the wedding, but various pressures begin to build before the big day, and other deaths occur.As the events get more and more chaotic you feel the absurdity of it all, and at times the unsavoury stuff will bore its way inside you. It is interesting to watch all the typical American values and clich√©s on happy life being torn apart, and there is some flashy direction. The performances are mostly good, though the characters are each thoroughly unlikeable, and it is clear there will not be a happy ending. Slater is good as the evil Burke, Diaz is annoying, but that is perfect for the character, and the rest are suitably argumentative. It is comedy meant to tip us over the edge, meant to be more sick than anything that has gone before, but it is the constant dark tone throughout, rather than the deeds which makes it disturbing. You get the feeling that everyone gets what they deserve in the end, and there is no-one to relate to. It is though, completely over-the-top and has some funny moments, and should not be taken seriously.7 out of 10- less and less depending on whether you are offended.

I knew it was about some guys accidentally killing a prostitute, but I expected the movie to keep the brutality at a sarcastic arms length. Several comedies these days are very violent, but it never spoils the fun because such movies usually have a sarcastic tone. This movie doesn't.The story is about Kyle (Jon Favreau) who is about to get married to Laura (Cameron Diaz). Kyle and his four friends go to Vegas where Boyd (Christian Slater) has planned a polterabend with drugs, prostitutes etc. Accidentally one of the friends (Michael played by Jeremy Piven) kills the prostitute. The five friends decide to bury the prostitute - plus an unfortunate security guard - in the desert. The rest of the story is pretty straightforward. Some of the friends can't deal with the moral implications of what they have done, and threatens to turn themselves in. A few of the friends and mostly Boyd, turn into psychopaths who are willing to kill innocents, or let innocents be killed, in order to preserve the secret.In Very Bad Things most of the victims die in gruesome way where they either fight for their lives or get to suffer a lot. Some of the murders are downright brutal, while some of them were probably meant to be fun, they end up being a cruel cocktail of humor and violence. The five friends evolve and I quickly started to dislike them all. Boyd is obviously the greatest psychopath of them all, but they all show psychopathic traits in not being willing to stop Boyd.So is it a bad movie? The main problem is that the movie doesn't know what it is. It tries to be a comedy and a thriller at the same time, but the cruelness quells the comedy and the comedy prevents the movie from being a believable thriller. However, the movie succeeded in leaving me with an uneasy feeling because I never knew what to expect. Would the next scene be fun, or would it be another brutal murder? It could have been an excellent thriller if Peter Berg had decided to go all the way. Sure the story isn't original, but the transformation of the five friends is well made. With a little fine tuning it could have been a good movie about the potential psychopath which dwells in some people, and it could have been a good story about morals and ethics.

So seldom do films illicit such a hilarious myriad of responses and reactions, and seldom have a group of actors agreed to behave so despicably on screen to mirror real life, selfishness, inflated senses of entitlement, and empty pursuits of empty obsessions by the most spoiled one percent of the population in a nation bursting with plenty.  Heh-heh, and it's all really funny in the worst, most awful way...and we laugh even harder.  Kill the minivan.Movies like this, especially American movies, come along so infrequently it takes a viewing or two to realize how brilliantly evil and subversive they are, to everything ideally American and otherwise.  The institution of marriage and the social dance and ritual of weddings?  Bury it in the desert.  A happy family, 2.5 kids and a minivan in the garage, in a house that looks like every other house on every other nicely manicured street presided over by happy, vacant white people for miles and miles around? Bury it in the desert.  The idiocy and empty posturing and bongload philosophising of inebriated male bonding?  Bury it in the desert.  All the learned responses that tell you to feel guilty when you want to laugh?  To react with a cool, clinical head and survive instead of giving in...bury it in the desert.  Dig a hole and bury it, and come home a cripple, because death and surrender are the easy way out.Unlike Hollywood's inventive, Renaissance days of the 60's and 70's, when visions were pursued in tandem with gate receipts, today all anyone seems to care about is a big, dumb opening weekend.  Hollywood seems to think that people outside of Southern California actually care how much a movie makes, as though that somehow automatically merits quality.  So what, what the hell matters after the opening weekend?  Are you as a filmmaker left with a Great Film or at least an earnest try at something interesting, or are you just left with a big, steaming piece of s*** disguised as commerce with your name all over it?Very Bad Things is in some select company as one of those movies that managed to squeak by and get produced by the Hollywood system in the 90's and still constantly challenge it's audience's preconceptions, morals and ability to withstand things that may upset their learned sensibilities, while executing some first class, chilling storytelling that any male who has seen it can eerily relate to.The scariest thing about this movie, and the reason it upsets so many people, is that we can see ourselves so easily as one of it's doomed characters.  We identify with them early on, and are drawn into their claustrophobic situations and scenarios of guilt, control and panic, not to mention the need, in the end, to save ourselves (another writer mentioned Daniel Stern's character's freakout at the gas station as the best scene of the movie and it is...here's a man coming to pieces before your very eyes). You have to wonder, how the heck did this gem of a movie get past the studio's test screenings?  When's the last time Hollywood ever tried to give you so many things in a 90-minute film?  Impossibly well-acted, ceaselessly visceral, funny at all the wrong moments...bravo to Peter Berg and all involved. "},{"Title":"Black - yes.

Kind Hearts and Coronets, Arsenic and Old Lace or Ladykillers or even slapsticky Splitting Heirs are fun. Whenever people commit murder (or try to) in a cheerful manner, I find the concept attractive. But this is not such a movie. Seeing posters of a chainsaw-wielding Christian Slater and Cameron Diaz as bride, you think this might be a macabre and funky satire. A return of dark humour. It's dark. But there is no humour. This movie fails to be good. Why? Because it is undecided. It could either take the route of sinister fun, or of  a drama - but it doesn't choose and tries to mix the two. The serious question How would you react if one of your best friends killed someone? Would you help him or rat out on him? is tackled in an idiotic way You just know Slater's character is a real psycho the instant you see him for the first time. And you know that someone like him would never have any friends close enough to risk their livelihoods for him. So the entire movie becomes a farce The question it poses is tackled incompetently. It is not funny, as the violence is not over-the-top or underdone, but on the level of a real, serious psychothriller, so it has no comedic value. The characters are not funny, just irritating and annoying. The dialogue isn't great.Just watch some old fashioned Ealing comedies.

I don't think many folks would want to watch something like this in the post-9/11 world, but then again, TRAINING DAY is just as nihilistic as this movie and it made over $24 million in its first weekend.The key to VERY BAD THINGS are in the characters of Robert Boyd, played by Christian Slater, and Kyle Fisher, played by Jon Favreau.  They're the opposite ends of the spectrum of good and evil, except that Kyle isn't as purely good as Boyd is flat-out horrible.  Boyd's the consummate supressed control/rage freak and it isn't an accident that he's not only not that bothered by the two deaths and one murder in Las Vegas, but relishes the opportunity to commit more of them. Kyle may be horrified at what's happened but he has the strange ability to internalize it, unlike the poor Berkow brothers and even Charles the mechanic. As played by the vastly underrated Leland Orser, Charles is great at showing us how a quiet, vacant fellow would react to this cavalcade of disaster (he reminded me of the Tobias Beecher character on OZ).The best or worst thing about this film, from an honesty standpoint, is that it hates everyone it sees and isn't afraid to say it. VERY BAD THINGS has vile portrayals of women, Cameron Diaz as a harridan whose final fate was darkly amusing, and Jeanne Tripplehorn is simply pathetic. The characters in the movie are also racist and anti-Semitic, but it's unclear to what effect that is being presented. Would they have not killed the security guard if he'd been white? Is there any reason to point out that the Berkow brothers are Jewish and have at least some insight into Jewish law and customs, beyond setting up Boyd's cruel comments to them and the disastrous funeral reception? No one in the movie is that nice, but there is some sympathy for Kyle and Daniel Stern's character, because they might have had OK lives if this hadn't happened (or would have deluded themselves into thinking their lives were happy). Everyone else here was headed for hell on earth anyway, I thought, and the events here just accelerated that process.Yet for all its nastiness and ugliness, this is also a very well-made film, the plotting is relentlessly ingenious, and it's one of the few films that plays better in an edited form without being neutered. I saw it on Comedy Central, where the most gruesome violence (like the chainsaw scene) was cut out and the language was dubbed (though you'd have to be clueless to not get what was REALLY being said). It worked on its chosen level, as a nihilistic and cruel comedy. I didn't much enjoy this film but I had to grade it on what it did, not how it did it. Like a great critic once said, not every good film is fun.

These words are reserved for gory horror films like any Italian/Asian trash horror such as Pasolini's Salo and Men Behind the Sun.

On par with the 18th century French novelist and philosopher Marquis de Sade's literature, Very Bad Things is a moral satire - something that is so exquisite in mixing horror and comedy it's rarely tackled on in movies nowadays.Very Bad Things is definitely not for the easily offended and squeamish - and this includes the viewers sensitive of racism, sexism and bad morals rampant in the film. Only brave viewers with iron-clad stomach and impenetrable amorality are encouraged to laugh merrily at the horrendous situations that unravel as the film progresses. To sum up my opinion, this film is dementedly brilliant and morbidly hilarious in every way as the spectacular example of blacker-than-black coffee comedy and satire.

I found it the funniest film I have ever seen.  I was literally hanging off the edge of my seat, holding my stomach, hoping I wouldn't follow through.  The way in which the characters deal with events is driven by such desperate, sweat dripping anxiety that you can't help but get emotionally involved with each individual character.The films plotline is basically about a group of guys in their thirties, who decide to have an all out entertaining 'Stag do' in Viva Las Vegas.  They leave their wives and children behind, to embark on a journey of adventure, free from the tyranny of everday life.  Importantly, it is obvious that all the guys are pretty stressed out with their lives and are in need of freedom and exilleration.....all but one Robert Boyd ( Christian Slater ) who is laid back and methodical in his thoughts.The guys end up having the time of their lives in a hotel room, deeply enjoying simultaneous hits, from all the temptations that surround them. Although everything is about to change for the worst as the call girl who was entertaining them, accidently gets killed.  The guys are thrown into despair and become hysterical.  Boyd is the only one calm and quickly begins to be ascertive,evaluating the situation as ''...a 105 pound problem''. Which means only one option is available, disposal of the body.From here on in, the film is launched into multiple body count territory, making me laugh longer and harder.  Daniel Stern is the main reason for this because it has to be his best comedic performance yet.  Watching him filled with paranoia, fearing everyone knows what he's done, is just delightful to see.  It really raises the question of what would you do in their situation.Do not be diswayed by the films very poor box office takings.  This is purely another cliched overlooked comedy classic, that unfortunately doesn't appeal to most.  Maybe I do love violence, maybe I have got a sick sense of humour but it's never stopped me recommending this film to everyone I know.Even though I rarely rate a film 10/10 and only masterpieces such as The Shawshank Redemption, are worthy... I don't hesitate to give 10/10, if only for sheer entertainment value alone.In summary, despite being totally over the top, extremely violent and not to mention the constant display of body dismemberment, there are notably fine performances and an evidently fine script.Could anyone out there let me know if this has been released on DVD...I can't find it anywhere!

Things are as chaotic as they expected in their hotel in Vegas - drink, drugs and a stripper.  However, when Michael accidentally kills the stripper things get messed up and they decide not to call the police - a decision that is reinforced when they murder a security guard who spots the girl's body.  They bury the two in the desert but it is not long before guilt and nerves threaten to destroy the group and their idyllic lives.When this film came out, I was pretty much of the mind that it wasn't for me it had had middling reviews, it was a `dark' comedy and I didn't really feel it was worth making a night out of seeing it.  However, on tv, it is easier to give things a try so I did.  The film opens with energy and quite quickly gets down to the crux of the matter with the bachelor night and the death.  At this point I knew that it was supposed to be a dark comedy, but it was playing it quite dark and not really comic.  Certainly the death of the stripper was not funny and the sobbing cries of the dying security guard were almost harrowing.  However shortly after this point the film stays with the dark violence but gets a lot sillier and, supposedly, funny.  This damages the film as a) it isn't funny and, b) the slightly silly comic tone is quite tasteless and doesn't fit with the very dark plot.  The film slowly descends into a sort of exaggerated farce and, whatever potential I saw at the start, is slowly but surely lost.The film does have enough energy to carry it though and you'll still be reasonably entertained by it even as it just gets daft - in fairness this was Berg's debut as writer/director so I can forgive him some of that. The main thing that annoyed me about the film was actually a small issue of quality control! In the final scene we have someone in a wheelchair but we can clearly see his feet in the space behind him (he has his legs tucked behind him) - how this was missed on the day of shooting, never mind the final edit I don't know.Like the film, the cast are quite let down by the material as it slips away from them - their characters become less and less believable as it goes on. Slater is a fine example - he starts out skating a fine line but his actions later are a bridge too far and he eventually ends up just hamming it. Favreau is actually quite good and Piven is pretty believable.  Stern is not great as he is not a great actor, but he does well enough for this.  Orser has surprisingly little impact considering this is the type of thing he seems to do a lot.  Fans of `that type of thing' will instantly recognise the gorgeous Kob√© Tai (I, of course, have never heard of her!) but she is only in it briefly and only does what she does best.  Sadly, she is as good a character as the lead actresses - Diaz has no character and is a problem even if Tripplehorn is marginally better (until her stupid final scene).Overall this is an energetic film that seems to want to shock rather than engage.  The violence is impacting and real in the early stages but gradually becomes comic and silly to the detriment of the film.  By the end of the film you realise that you are meant to be laughing but by then it is too late - it really should have stuck with keeping the violence real and upsetting rather than expecting us to find it funny.  By the final scene this had managed to squander any potential that it had when it had begun, but it is still worth a watch as it is just about energetic enough to carry you to the end regardless.

I have a bit of a sadistic streak when it comes to movies because I really like films that are more realistic in the execution and their endings. In regards to the familiar plot of boy meets girl, boy looses girl, boy gets girl back again, I have hardly seen it, and when I have, the relationship has not lasted. Then there is the girl that hates the guy and finally falls for him at the end, and though I have seen that happen, it has never happened to me.Five guys go on a trip to Las Vegas for a bachelor party and during the events where they take almost every drug available, one of them accidentally kills the prostitute while having sex with her in the bathroom. This is when the problems happen because they all freak out, except for one who says that the best thing to do is to take her out into the desert and bury her because they cannot get the police involved. Unfortunately things go from bad to worse when a security guard walks in and finds the body, and they deal with it by killing him as well. This guy (Christian Slater) quickly takes control of the situation, and very quickly the other four find that things have gone out of their control. Through Slater's act of killing the guard, they are all implicated.Things have worked out very well though as they successfully hid the corpses in the desert and all returned to Los Angeles none the worse. Unfortunately guilt begins to gnaw away at one of the men and he begins to have anxiety attacks. In dealing with this at the mock wedding, he is accidentally killed by his brother. When the guys wife stumbles on the truth, Slater once again takes control of the situation in a way that the others do not want done.The theme of this movie is how things go from bad to worse, and through a small incident, the lives of these men are destroyed. They constantly try to rise above the situation but it continues to dominate them and things continually get worse. The children are given to the guy and his fianc√© in the will, and things seem to work better, only to discover that the life insurance policy has expired and the price of their house has dropped substantially, leaving them with two children, one of them physically handicapped, and very little money to look after them.As I said before, this is a black comedy (though Man Bites Dog is still the blackest comedy that I have ever seen) and we attempt to laugh at the misfortunes of others. We want to laugh because what we see in this movie is so disturbing that we want to put it at the back of our minds and forget that such a thing has ever happened. Unfortunately, like the movie, we simply cannot do that because our past always continues to rise up and haunt us. In one way it is one of the guys freaking out, then it is a curious wife, and a brother who has overcome with depression because he has killed his elder brother.Nothing good comes out of what happens and I guess this in a way really mimics life. What we are laughing at in Very Bad Things is life itself because what we are confronted with is something that could happen to us. Slater plays the level headed one, but unfortunately, his solutions end up causing more problems that they solved. In the end he must also face not only the consequences of his actions, but he must also face he greed.All of the characters have a tragic flaw in them. The younger brother's lust, and anger finally undoes him as he accidentally kills the prostitute and then his brother. The elder brother simply cannot remain calm, and it is this liability to panic that brings about his death. The fianc√© simply cannot say no, and lets his fianc√© come wife, dominate him, as well as Slater. He is able to say no to the prostitute, but she is not applying pressure to him. As soon as he says no, she leaves, but his wife and Slater will not let him say no. Slater is a very intelligent and dominant man, but he falls apart when he steps on the wrong toes. He believes that there is nothing that he can do, but unfortunately when he gets inbetween the fiancees, he discovers that when you annoy the wrong person too much, they lash out.Nobody redeems themselves in this movie, and those that did not do wrong, are brought apart by other's wrongs. Nobody comes out on top, nor can they say at the end that they have won. Instead there one mistake has wormed deeply into their lives and ripped it completely apart. Now I think about the depth of this movie, I am seriously considering adding it to my collection.

Favreau is great as the always indecisive bride to be, it must to be sheer relief to get away from the always nagging Cameron Diaz. She's so intolerable, any guy would be out of there in a minute. Very Bad Things is great as how our well written characters, deal with the tidying of the mess, Slater, an unbalanced real estate agent, the remorseless of them all. Soon a bigger mess evolves, when the gang's number starts to diminish, through accidental and malicious acts, or ones of sacrifice, until, only two men remain, with what's left of their life, it's hysterical. Honestly the death scene with Slater, desperately reaching for a door back into the church, where the ceremony's about to start, it looks as though blood was just slapped on him.

Kyle Fisher (Jon Faverau) is about to take the plunge from bachelorhood into marriage with the beautiful (if wedding-obsessed/perfectionist) Laura Garretty (Cameron Diaz). A week before the wedding, Kyle and four of his best friends are going on a last night of debauchery for Kyle. Kyle's best friend, Boyd (Christian Slater) privately arranges to have a stripper stop by. However, a bathroom accident leaves the group with a dead stripper in their care, and after they try to cover it up, the bodies start piling it up as well.Very Bad Things is the definition of a dark comedy. I challenge anyone to come up with something darker than this. Sick, Twisted, Gory, Depraved, Shocking, are all terms that one could use to describe this movie. And depending on one's sense of humor, funny and clever are also usable.Acting is key here, as most (if not all) humor is very dark, so the actors have to present the material in a way that's still funny despite it's nature. The film's real stand-out is Christian Slater, who uses his charisma to take advantage of everyone else's fears and convince them to cover everything up instead of coming clean. Boyd is no doubt a complete psychopath, but Slater oozes coolness and his collectedness in the face of extreme pressure make his advice seem like the best thing to do (in the eyes of the other guys). Boyd is the character that holds this movie together; if the audience can't buy the guys taking his advice (under the circumstances), then the movie would fall apart. Jon Faverau is okay as the mild-mannered Kyle, though admittedly he's not given much to work with. Jeremy Piven shows a little bit of Ari Gold in the motor-mouthed Michael. Leland Orser is solid as the quiet Moore, who wisely leaves being the creep to Slater. Daniel Stern is an unlikely choice for the neurotic Adam, and though he isn't the best performer of the bunch, he's effective enough that he sheds his Home Alone-era clownish personality (which was probably his goal, though his lack of roles shows that producers didn't think he was effective enough). Cameron Diaz is good as the perfectionist bride from hell, though she could have used a little more nastiness.Berg's script is actually very good, especially for an actor in the first time in the writer and director's seats. The dialogue is clever at times, and frequently very colorful, so much so that one has to wonder how much (if any at all) is ad-libbed. Berg is also good as a director; I liked his use of the hand-held camera in the hotel room scene, as it gave the appropriate drugged-out perspective.Very Bad Things is not a perfect film. It loses it's steam shortly after the Vegas scenes, though admittedly it's not a complete waste of time from there on out; I openly admit to having laughed a good few times after that, it's just that the sense of fun vanished. There are a few plot holes here and there, one of which was meant to be a red herring, but the answer to what really happens never comes (I guess it's implied, but not effectively enough). The ending in particular doesn't work. While appropriately twisted, the shock value doesn't measure up to what proceeded it, so it seems weak.Overall, I enjoyed Very Bad Things in some sense, though it's not as good as one could hope. I recommend it to anyone with an appreciation of the genre, and who has a strong stomach (the gore level nearly matches, if not surpasses the Saw movies).

There is so much about this film that you might miss & probably be disgusted with at least the first time through. Now this isn't a film for kids or for really anyone under the age of 21 for that matter. It's not that they might not enjoy it, it's just really for those of the marrying range. I would recommend this for men in particular as most women will probably be repulsed by all of what's going on. Nevertheless, for men about ready to take the biggest plunge of all (and no sky-diving is cake) marriage, are sure to enjoy as long as you have a somewhat sick sense of humor. If you are completely uptight and enjoy crap like Two & Half men (Charlie Sheen remember Platoon or Wall Street? what the hell happened? Even the Hot Shots movies were actually funny!) well then just pass on this because you won't get it. If you don't care for it the first time you see it, then I would suggest watching it again maybe with a friend before he is about to get married.

It's not the good look that can kill; it's kill to look good! Although this could be one of the wildest cinematic satires ever but unfortunately at its third act (starting from the murder of the late friend's wife in her bedroom by Christian Slater..) the movie just lost its logical strength or its flow's power to turn into a sequence of foolish images which had been ran by the writer / director (Peter Berg) as he wanted and not as the movie's drama wanted, hence the whole thing deviated from the possible senses to the era of not making any sense..The probability of the crazy events, as we all saw in the first hour, was so solid by the good story's fictional assumption. However after that, everything has transformed into such a farce which was done cruelty and coercively by (Peter Berg)'s hard desperate fabrication ! Thus we watch firstly (Christian Slater) commits a new murder ! Secondly, the murder of him ! And we witness (Cameron Diaz) showing her hidden truth as a cutthroat ! Then the writer / director takes revenge on all his lying, hypocrite, and culprit characters so he paralyzes them by quadriplegia and makes the wife insane too !?? Well, the intentional extravaganza here wasn't effective simply because the dramatic situation, which the whole movie had been based on, was admissible inside the frame of the beastly black comedy; yet at its end it went so far melodramatically, shouting madly its motif in irrational changes seemed not pertinent with anything before it. Yes, the story is an exaggerating but this very end was more exaggerating to the extent where it would expose or destroy what was before it. Ending the movie in this chain of catastrophic events inflated it like a balloon and then exploded it all; being persuasive as a drama and influencing as a satire.It seemed that (Berg) retaliates harshly upon the suburban community, especially with the movie's last shot. But he requited the immoderation with another immoderation, pushing this community's hellish characters into absolute hell. So, it was vendetta more than enjoyable time, and even as a vendetta it wasn't enjoyable inasmuch as exorbitantly frantic. It came to uncover the hidden ugliness yet with ugly end. Clearly this crazy finale destroyed all the craziness of the movie!(Very Bad Things) is perhaps the bloodiest caricature you'll see, but it isn't that wholly smart. It discloses burningly the truth about its well-polished society as a perfect subject for a horror movie with enough monsters and enough washing machines to clean the blood this time ! Though, the movie's way of saying this came to an end where it was intensively melancholic, thinking that horror could be good black comedy, achieving a cruel disturbing state as very bad melodrama !

These sorts of movies are comedies for sure, but they add a serious amount of drama and gruesomeness making us wonder if it's OK to laugh with what has been shown. Very bad things is such a comedy but unlike usual I actually love this film for its brilliant mixture of sweet comedy and dramatic horror.The movie has an impressive cast and all actors do a more than fine job. It all starts with Cameron Diaz who only wants to get her perfect wedding, but since this movie is about a bachelor party gone horribly wrong she doesn't get to play the main part. Nevertheless we still get to see pretty much of her and she does an outstanding job as the nervous and obsessive soon-to-be-wife. The only other woman playing an important part is actress Jeanne Tripplehorn who is emotionally steadier, but then again she's not very much involved.The lead roles are all for the men. This dark comedy tends to focus mostly on the incidents during the party and how each of these men tries to deal with its aftermath. They each wanna pick up their lives again afterwards, but not all of them find it so easy to do. It all involves five men actually.The centerpiece of this story is of course the one who's about to get married soon. This character, named Kyle Fisher, is played by actor Jon Favreau who's probably most recognizable for playing an astronaut in the disaster movie Deep impact. Even though he gets dragged into this mess, emotionally he tries to stay away from it as far as possible. He doesn't panic nor relax. Basically he can't believe that this is actually happening. He is your average sweet guy who couldn't cheat on his wife despite the sexy prostitute invited at his own bachelor party.Secondly, there is Kyle's best friend who's a mechanic and doesn't talk an awful lot. He's somewhat weird but in a harmless way. Actor Leland Orser is one of those unknowns who has been in a couple of famous films though. He plays a similar role of a crazed man in Se7en and Alien resurrection.Then there are also two brothers coming along. The first one is played by Jeremy Piven who's virtually been playing nothing but smaller parts in pretty famous movies (such as Heat, Rush hour 2 and Black hawk down) but the most famous of the two brothers is without a doubt actor Daniel Stern (whom we know as one of two clumsy burglars in the first two Home alone-movies.) These brothers seemingly can't stand each other because they are so very different. Jeremy Piven is the one who initiates the tragedy in this movie and Daniel Stern is the one who's constantly in panic worried that the police will find out about their atrocities. The acting performance of the latter one is in fact one of the very best things.Last but certainly not least is the guy who makes sure that the story keeps going forward. He's is the leader of this outfit and makes all the hard decisions even though after a while he seems likely to cross the line indefinitely. The actor playing this ever self-confident character is Christian Slater and of all the men in this movie, he is easily the most popular one. Slater was the pupil of Sean Connery in The name of the rose back in 1986, played at the side of Kevin Costner in the 1991-romantic adventure film Robin Hood Prince of thieves and even got himself the main part in the marvelous cult-classic True romance which was written by Quentin Tarantino himself. His acting is not only top-notch and the best thing in this movie, but it's also quite possibly his finest performance ever!In short A very funny yet at times pretty disturbing dark comedy with a colorful cast to say the least.

Jon Favreau is excellent as the lead, he underplayed it and I dug that, he also had some great scenes with Diaz and was quite likable, I really dug him. Leland Orser is very good as one of the friends I liked him as well. Cameron Diaz is incredibly gorgeous and is amazing as always and is amazing here, she plays one of the most annoying bitches I have ever seen in a film, but she was just so amazing at it, she really is a versatile actress ! (Diaz Rules!!!!!!!). Christian Slater is also amazing as always and is amazing here, he played the self absorbed psycho really well, and put a grin on my face a lot of the time, I really liked his performance here! (Slater Rules!!!!!!!). Jeremy Piven is OTT here and it works, he was hysterically funny, I felt bad for him, he rocked!. Daniel Stern is awesome here he was just so paranoid and worrying all the time I couldn't help but find it funny, but I also felt sorry for him too. Jeanne Tripplehorn does what she has to do adequately as the wife. Rest of the cast are fine. Overall I highly recommend it. ***1/2 out of 5 "},{"Title":"Chainsaws + Cameron Diaz = ???????","Date":"26 December 2005","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Thriller","Review":" You may have seen in other reviews my experiences of going to the movies with Gary.

I found it to be very very unrealistic and totally not believable. Now, while other movies are unrealistic they can still be believable. They make sense. For instance, Cameron Diaz at the end bashes in Slater. To me, they just throw in all these scenes to make the the audience go WOW and WOW, but they are uncalled for. Its almost spoofy in the way things happen and the way they just come up. For instance, in the end scene, when we see the 2 guys after the accident in wheel chairs and the dog with a missing leg, to me, a scene like that belongs in a Wayons Brothers movie. I think if this movie had a better rewrite and a more polished director, it could have been excellent, because the story is there and so is the humor. It had very good humor. It was a black comedy turned into a spoofy comedy. Almost like the director didn't want to commit to any one genre. And that is one of the major things wrong. Suicide Kings a serious movie with great humor was awesome and believable. The characters didn't just start killing each other to shock the audience.

It is a very black satire about a group of yuppies who throw a bachelor party in Las Vegas for one of the group about to get married.  A prostitute invited to the party is accidently killed in flagrante delicto and this group without a moral compass of their own follows the lead of one amoral member. The group then descends into a nightmare from which there is no escape as the original decision leads according to its own implacable logic to more and more heinous deeds.The humour of the movie is extremely black and absurdist and rather difficult to describe.  But the amazing feat of the director and actors is they pull it all off.  As the characters become increasingly more crazed and hysterical, you feel the relief of being outside the nightmare they are experiencing.  From this vantage point the completely offbeat and irreverent events resulting from a bachelor party gone horribly wrong, escalating constantly into scenes and situations at which you can only marvel, in the hands of this writer and director, are actually hilarious, if you can maintain your perspective that this is satire and not reality.

Every time someone gets killed in Very Bad Things, you start wishing it would be her rather than the poor guys whose only crime was to get a little carried away. The only funny moment is when the prostitute dies, a scene that looks very close to being physically impossible. The rest of it is so dreary you just wish it would end, and end soon.Then there is the delivery of the dialogue. I don't know who told the director that getting a bunch of men in a room and instructing them to scream incoherently at one another constitutes acting, but they should be shot. Christian Slater still can't get past being a second-rate Jack Nicholson impersonator, and the rest of the cast are so utterly unmemorable that they are probably thankful they aren't remembered for this film. The ending, when it does come, makes one wonder if the director was trying to make fun of the disabled or not.I'm not even going to give Very Bad Things a rating, since one cannot give films a zero on the IMDB.

Until I saw this, the only film that ever been able to make me squirm with discomfort was MEET THE FEEBLES. This was even worse, probably because these atrocities were being done to real people, and not puppets. The story revolves around five friends having a crazy bachelor party in Vegas. One of them has sex with a prostitue, but mid-coitus accidently impales her head on a coat hook. The men get panicky, and more deaths result. One thing about the film that was admittedly annoying was the constant, constant yelling and screaming from the main charecters. Daniel Stern is the worst, but they all scream so much you wonder how they didn't get caught immediately. Except for Stern, though, all the performances are top-notch, particularly from Christian Slater, who resorts to murder so quickly and coldly that it makes you wonder about the charecter's past.

I've no idea why I found this film so riotously funny mostly throughout. Maybe because it's very Jewish.

In civilian language, this means that writing the beginning of a script for a movie is the easy part. Keeping it going through the middle is the tough bit.This is exactly the problem for Very Bad Things. After the first 30 minutes, I thought Hell, this is a pretty good movie! In Act One, we learn that Fish (Jon Favreau) is getting married to Laura (Cameron Diaz). We see that Laura is a real snobette and commandeers poor Fish around all the time. So, anyway, he goes off with four of his old male buddies on a stag night. The four others are well introduced Christian Slater plays a sleazy, no-moral estate agent called Boyd, who has taken a few self-help courses and whos lines are nicely peppered with the formulaic 'pep-talk' from these courses. Daniel Stern, of 'Home Alone' fame, plays Adam Berkow, a weirdo, semi-stereotypical jew with major guilt syndrome. His brother Michael (Jeremy Piven) is the normal one of the two and has a great talk with Fish early in the movie about the horror and boredom of marriage. Remember, this is where the film is still good and entertaining. Finally, there's Moore (Leland Orser - yes, you did see him in Se7en) who doesn't really need to be there, narratively speaking. But never mind.So, they go off on a bender in Vegas, complete with stripper. Michael, who is bored with his wife, decides to take her into the bathroom for a little rumpy-pumpy. This quickly becomes spiky-spiky, as he accidentally kills her! Yeek! They decide to bury the body in the desert, since no-one knows she's in that hotel room.While they are trying to figure out what to do about this, a hotel security guard has been sent up to see what all the stag noise is. Unluckily, he sees the stripper's body, so Boyd - the amoral one and the one who convinces the others to bury the stripper - pops the guard off with a cork screw!So, Act One draws to a close, and we are left with what could become a good movie five guys, with whom you can either identify or sympathise, have gotten themselves into a very sticky situation. How are they going to handle this?Well, as I say, when Act Two starts, the movie could go either way. Sadly, it seems that the writer burned off all his A-material in Act One, and from here on in the film just gets more and more silly. The first big flashing red light of 'writer-not-using-his-head'-syndrome comes when the security guard, who they killed and buried in the desert along with the stripper, getsan article in the newspaper and is referred to as 'a missing person'. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't that guard SENT up to the room by Hotel Staff? And then, all of a sudden, after going into that room, he doesn't show up down at reception again. And they don't even THINK about getting hold of the guy who paid for that room and question him? Are we really expected to believe that the staff said 'Oh, Larry didn't come back down from room 1078. That's odd. He's gone missing. He's just vanished into thin air. Oh well, better call the newspapers'?After this, the film descends into stupidity, and all the characters come off as having no feelings or guilt. Cameron Diaz especially acts way out of character near the end. It's just not believable. It's a shame. After Act One, the writer trades good dialogue, believable and dynamic character exposition and a well-paced plot line for grotesque violence with no justification. I swear, after the first 20 minutes I thought I was watching another 'Deer Hunter'. After it's over, it's more like 'Dear God'.

Certainly Berg uses the somewhat unartistic institution of shock value to develop the story, but in light of the highly meaningful and poignant Natural Born Killers and Pulp Fiction I hardly think that is detestable.

This film was not met with critical success, mostly because it was so far beyond the norm.  It certainly seems to have its share of critics in this forum however.  To any who would berate this film as a useless work of trash I would certainly suggest you never read a Greek tragedy.  I think anyone can find parallels between the two.

I usually enjoy the black comedy genre, but I didn't find myself laughing a lot in that one.The pace of the movie is slow and it takes a long time to get to the core of the plot. The actors are OK, given the not so great material they are given to work with. But I had this impression all along the movie, that the director hesitated between a black comedy and a film noir and managed to achieve neither. The movie has a few funny moments that would ruin a film noir but unfortunately too few of these funny moments to be a comedy.As for the movie being unrealistic, sick or lacking morals, well, of course it is but it is supposed to be a fiction... If regular people were doing so much cocaine and booze and chopping dead bodies into pieces like that, well, we would have a problem...Overall, an over-hyped movie. Maybe Berg should watch again real black comedies, like Fargo and take some notes for his next movie...

But my colleagues writing these commentaries either seem to enjoy it, or rather be repulsed by it. Neither one of these interpretations is particularly appropriate. It is true that the film is very gory. No one can deny that. Yet Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction are both well-worn in my collection. Blood doesn't necessarily turn me off. Rather, Very Bad Things is a poor movie because the plot is subservient to the desire for violence and absurdity. The screenwriters chose images and scenes that they wanted and wrote a plot that would generate those scenes.They wanted a bunch of guys to be in the middle of the desert piecing together whole bodies from the limbs and torsos that they had just cut up. They wanted Jon Favreau to crawl across the ground to an obnoxious kid and fall out of his wheelchair doing so. They wanted Christian Slater to do that evil look he does so well. But they didn't stop to rationalize the plot itself.For all of the moral and sociological undertones of the film, it really has very little to stand on. As a moral tale it pales in comparison with genuine moral tales like A Simple Plan or even the dark comedic versions like The Last Supper. Its plot structure and implications are subservient to the desire for blood, which can never be a motivation for a good film.Though the performances are solid, the writing is weak. The ending is perhaps the worst possible ending they could have chosen. One gets the feeling that the screenwriters got far enough in and just decided who needed to die, and wrote devices to create that. There's no credibility past minute fifteen, and a non-credible moral tale isn't much of anything at all.Avoid this. Not because it's bloody, but because it's bad. And if it's blood you want, go somewhere else. Do yourself a favor.

It's dark, it's full of psychological stress, it has a storyline with twists, and it qualifies as weird.Unlike Dogs, the movie seems to want to switch at the halfway mark, and lighten up the violence with even more violence. I guess the theory is that once the violent, gory deaths start coming fast and furious, the viewer will stop being shaken by them. The blackest of black comedy is put into the mix, and you're urged to laugh at someone as they are mowed down by an SUV in a fit of rage.Perhaps by this point it has become over the top. Unfortunately, getting there is far more painful than necessary. One scene involving allegedly sane, normal people, trapping a mortally wounded man in a room, while he begs for help and screeches in pain -- well, that's just a bit much. Several times the characters are made to do implausible things, even while slowly succumbing to the horror of what they have done.And in the end, it's not Reservoir Dogs. The violence isn't plausible, it's grotesque. The story isn't reasonable, it's warped. The characters garner no sympathy, because they also don't garner believability.What it is, is just unpleasant.

It rates a 2 instead of a 1 simply because some viewers might find it an instructive look into what happens when erstwhile talented people try to make a good movie out of what must be a hideous screenplay.

Cameron Diaz who does pretty much nothing for a large amount of the movie. Christian Slater totally type cast as a mad idiot, one of the burglars from Home Alone (he's also in City Slickers), some guy who was in Alien Resurrection, a guy who was in Friends as a boyfriend. The grand total of 2 people whose names I knew and the rest were faces I semi-recognized from other films or TV.I really can't see how the hooker was killed, she has something in the back of her head, obviously a drunken accident during frantic sex. Why they didn't call the police right away? Everyone apart from 1 man and the hooker were in the same room. They were all drunk. As soon as they start planning the cover-up they are incriminating themselves.Call the police, CSI go over the crime scene and work out what happened. The only person worrying about the drugs is the only person who took any. It wasn't murder but as soon as they start planning to cover it up and hide the body then they are committing a crime.They argue that long that Hotel security turn up. Legally he hasn't got the right to stroll in the room so the drugs he sees are inadmissible as evidence. Christian Slater then attacks him with a corkscrew (once he spots the dead hooker) and kills him so right now he's guilty of murder, drugs offenses & also conspiracy to conceal a crime.The idiots then clean up the crime scene, cut up the bodies and bury them in the desert. Have these chaps never seen CSI Las Vegas? The desert shifts and moves, things uncover eventually. All the bull going on in the desert, separating their bodies and fighting and praying. How did no-one drive past and notice what they were doing? The newspaper reports the missing security guard and everyone suddenly goes mad. Seeing a police officer drives one of the men to paranoia. His children screaming for candy, he should have just got into the van and driven away. It would have prevented all the crap that happened inside.Adam is succumbing to more paranoia at the wedding rehearsal dinner. Seeing as he was the only person who wanted to call the police from the 1st moment. The voice of sense, but calling the guy getting married (Mike) a murderer was a bit too much. It was an accident, wet floor, drugs, drink.Mike hitting the mini-van was totally pointless and lying to the police about arguing was also pointless. Killing Mike or is it Adam (we can't tell who is who, that's how easy the film is to follow. Especially with 2 actors who looks so physically alike) shortly after wards, utterly pointless. The film has gone from the stupid to the ridiculous.From here the whole religious aspect start getting a bit too intense. It just degrades into a bunch of Angry men shouting at each other, being too intense and fooling themselves into the illusion they did nothing wrong.The brother seriously over-acts unhappy at the funeral. Then another shouting match, the film is basically a large collection of shouting matches. The guy who died had left a note confessing to the whole killing of the hooker and security guy to his widow.They then lie to the widow telling her a modified version of the actual events. It's obvious from the look on his face Slater was going to kill the widow. I don't see why he then kills her husband to cover him killing her. Right there should be where the other men who are alive should have turned on Slater and killed him or turned him in. After all it's him that suggests the cover up and screams to not call the police and he killed the hotel guard.During a session with a lawyer the guy getting married confesses everything to his fianc√©. Finally we reach the wedding. Diaz kills Slater (apparently) but he overcomes what looked like having his head crushed with a coat stand and it's Cameron's turn to become a heartless killer sending hubby out to kill the final friend who knows, bury him & Slater and lose the dog they've acquired through the death of Mike & his widow.He almost kills the friend but their involved in a head-on crash traveling back. The friend is thrown through both car windscreen and the guy loses his legs some how. Why he and his wife end up caring for the friend is beyond me but the weak ending tops off a generally weak film that was never going any where anyway.My Advice? Avoid this film if possible.

This was like one of those Jacobean tragedies like Tis Pity She's a Whore, where all of the characters are both evil *and* stupid, and where the story just lumbers along through a series of increasingly vicious tragedies until at the end everyone is dead or destroyed or maimed or crazy.

Having just seen him in Pump Up The Volume and Heathers at the time, I found myself trying to see any merit in that statement. However, films like Very Bad Things and more recently 3000 Miles To Graceland have seen Slater further and further relegated to the dreaded B-list. The simple reason for this is that, like Nicholson, he only seems capable of playing one role, and unlike Nicholson, the one role he can play does not endear him at all.A case in point is the scene after the death of the prostitute, when the men are arguing about what to do with her. The scene rapidly becomes annoying because the actors all scream over the top of one another, and making out exactly what they are arguing about is a difficult ask. An actor of Jack Nicholson's character would take charge of the scene and use their charm to steer it in a direction that serves the film. Given that Slater is meant to be the lead in this scene, his inability to do so hurts the film immeasurably.He's not the only one, unfortunately. Much of the film revolves around Cameron Diaz's character and her imminent marriage. The problem with this is that every scene with Diaz in it leaves the viewer in a state of confusion as to why any sane man would want to marry her. She comes off as a spoiled brat who wants to prove that Aristotle was wrong because the world revolves around her. For a character the audience is meant to sympathise with, this is a fatal flaw. Normally, a protoganist you can't stand is enough of a problem in itself, but it is a symptom of a much deeper problem here.In any story, whether it is told on film, in audio, by oral tradition, or on paper, setup is everything. One has to be able to relate to a character before anything that happens to them can seem to have the slightest sense of consequence. That, unfortunately, is where Very Bad Things falls down. The writers seemed to think that getting married in a matter of weeks was sufficient reason to care about the plight of one of the men. It isn't when the bride is someone as annoying as Cameron Diaz's character, especially not in light of the fact that the woman hasn't played a remotely likeable character since.Another strike against the film is how straightforward it all feels. All we see are endless arguments between a bunch of very generic characters that go nowhere. While the element of a lawman eagerly pursuing the people we're meant to sympathise with is a major clich√©, it would have been preferable to the whole lot of nothing we get here. The whole film is so one-note that a music teacher would have given up on this kind of student after half an hour.The final strike against the film is that, in spite of running at a mere hundred minutes, it feels padded. Arguments that could have been finished in a minute take ten, many scenes just plain feel redundant, and the number of actors could have easily been reduced to nothing without impact on the story. The question of whether the makers had a coherent plan, leave alone a judicious eye for editing, comes up so many times during the viewing experience that I am certain the people involved will leave this mess off their resum√©.Overall, I give Very Bad Things a one out of ten. I'd give it a two if it had any kind of redeeming quality, but it seems that the makers saw Heathers, thought that they could do antiheroes, and consequently underestimated the value of the redeeming quality. The result, as you can expect, is a hundred-minute festival of indifference.

If this is good movie I can call Bodyguard an Oscar winner...Really shame on the director , the cast and the actors involved ; I think these are amongst the worst roles Cameron Diaz ever played on the movie... likewise for Cristian Slater. Not to speak about the script - the mindless cruelty, much gore and stupid jokes are now the trademark for so called black comedy pulp fiction's replacements. Instead, they are so pulp you can wipe your **s with it! So much unusual cruelty, unethical and impudent behavior I rarely seen even in B-rated movie, not to say about this one which has very big ambitions (or at least this is shown).Avoid seen this movie unless you're simple minded gore liking non thinking human being with no feelings except low ones. In this case, this is your movie folks!

The sadistic behaviour is just reprehensible.  The continuing gore that escalates throughout the movie just made viewing this movie too uncomfortable - the prolonged and gruesome death of the hotel security guard was almost enough to make me press stop.The humour is ruined by the general lack of morals the characters display - irony is best with limits - and the lack of control for the comedy - one minute it is a black comedy and the next minute it is pure slapstick.  The result is a real horrorshow of bad comedy and sick violence.With a decent cast and technically sound movie, it is too bad that the script and characters couldn't have risen to the occasion.

I find it particulary hard to believe that the people who killed a security man, chopped up the bodies and go out to bury them in the desert honor the request of their Jewish friend to sort out the pieces and bury them in a natural position. And someone crushed between two cars not only survives (to die later) but does so intact, beleive you me, in such a crash your limbs are gonna be all over the place! Then the woman the bachelor is going to marry turns out to be a complete psycopath and wants him to kill his best (and the only one left) friend and the dog so they can live a normal life, he comes to sense in the desert and decides not to and drives home with his friend and the dog still alive and then BAM car-crash out of nowhere! for no reason at all, they weren't drinking and stuff, they just hit a car. This causes a change in the newely wed main characters personality and lands himself and his friend in wheelchairs and the dog loses a front-leg. I feel really sorry for the dog. Worst ending ever!

After all, miracle of God and Nature that it is, some of the best things that grow out of planet Earth are nurtured and fed by some of the worst.Which V S T. laughingly referred to in some quarters as silver screen entertainment, most assuredly is. Equine compost heap. Said entertainment, here, has been written and directed by Peter Berg. Peter is not a doctor. He just played one on TV (as Dr. Billy Kronk on the late Chicago Hope). Peter is ALSO NOT a writer and director of silver screen entertainment fare. He just THINKS he is. What Peter really is in movies is a producer. He produces, thru his writing and directing, equine compost heap. This is what happens when you work for and hang around someone like David E. Kelley. Mr. Kelley makes it look so easy that any no-talent like Peter Berg thinks he can do it, too. Logic would seem to dictate that this is the worst movie of the 20th century. Except, of course, for all of the other movies which were also the worst movies of the 20th century. Gee, it's just so hard to choose. Trying to decide on a worst movie of the 20th century is like trying to select a petit-four from the dessert cart at a fancy French restaurant. YOU WANT ALL OF THEM!!!How do I love this movie in its awfulness? Let me count the ways. Acting! Man, have we got us some acting here. If you enjoy actors and actresses doing NOTHING BUT yelling and screaming at each other for 100 minutes straight, then come on in and enjoy this acting nonpareil. How would you like to see a hooker get hooked to death on a towel hook in a bathroom? I tellya, it's a scream! Body dismemberments? We got 'em! And what's really fun about it is trying to re-sort the mixed-up parts according to race, ethnicity and religion. Among other criteria. How about trashing a Jewish funeral? Are we having fun yet?! Let's corkscrew to death the African-American security guard. After all, we're making a black comedy here. And while we're doing all this yelling and screaming at each other, let's also see how many other people we can do in -- including among ourselves -- before Peter runs out of film. Brother, I can hardly stop laughing! And if you think THIS movie is funny, I've got a couple more enormous howls for you Slavery and The Holocaust. Laugh riots!Truthfully, I'm embarrassed for myself that I gave this movie such a high rating on IMDb. It's the only movie to which I've ever given a 1. Maybe I'll be able to live that down.

The film is filled with those wonderful screen gems including 1 dimensional characters and writing and direction so cliched you would rather watch back to back to back episodes of Full House. The film is misogynist and racist. Aside from an attempt at getting a laugh out of hackneyed low brow humor, which it can't even do, this film is no more than painful both to endure as a viewer of a story and as someone who respects some of the actors, in this film, based on their previous work (John Faverau and Christian Slater). Oh, and did I forget to mention Cameron Diaz's performance - again, rather choose Full House and watch Bob Saget as a stronger example of character study.

I have seen Robin Hood about six hundred times because  my father likes it, and never have I begun to detest it. I even suffered through the Horse Whisperer and hated it fiercely, but didn't want to drag it down with a negative review on IMDB.But this movie was so bad it made me mad. Very Bad Things?? Very Bad Movie. Might as well have tag-lined it Rent it for 3  bucks and feel ill within the first half-hour! Guaranteed!.Let's go through the plot Men have drunken, drug-filled lascivious bachelor party. Prostitute shows up. Man accidentally kills prostitute during sex. Slater murders guard, convinces others to cut  both bodies up and bury them in the desert. Then, all the others slowly crack apart and are slowly murdered. None are suicides, although they're  not all killed by the same character. Two survive, I won't say who. (Like it matters. All the characters are unlikeable, and  they're not even COOL unlikeable, except for Cameron Diaz.)I think this movie was supposed to be funny in a dark way. And it was. I laughed my butt off during the last, say, minute and a half, when I could no longer stand my horror and disbelief and  alternate boredom.I think it was a brave try by all. The acting performances were all great, for the record. The plot might have worked. But there was too much gore and not enough genuine guilt to make the whole 'falling apart from guilt' bit fly. Also, I am irritated that Slater's character was supposed to be so funny. It was hard to take him seriously as a big bad dude once I'd seen him goofing off with his buddies.All in all, this movie sucked. It was needlessly gory and the wit we've all come to expect from Slater and um. the other guy..the one who played the Michael character wasn't present. And poor Cameron  Diaz was so annoying I was kind of hoping that someone would shoot her character, too.

It fails unequivocally on all levels, from superficial to symbolic, with no redeemable value whatsoever.This viewer left the theatre with a sick stomach, despite having enjoyed such classically gory movies as The Shining, Evil Dead (all of 'em), Clockwork Orange, and others.

I don't want to meet those people who do, quite frankly.In the end, there is only one way to accurately describe the experience of watching this movie You know that horrible disgusting/unsettling/hard to watch moment that some movies have, where you just have to grit your teeth and watch, knowing that the good guys will win and things will get better soon?

Now, Very Bad Things has replaced Grosse Pointe in that category.  There was ABSOLUTELY NO HUMOR in this film.  I'm still trying to figure out why it was advertised as a comedy.  I sat in the theater anticipating the ending, just so I could get away from this torturous celluloid on the screen.  The characters in this movie were the most irritating I have ever seen. Christian Slater was so self-righteous and annoying in his role, I was practically wishing that he was present in the theater so that I could give him the good smack across the face that he needs for being so full of himself.  Cameron Diaz was a BIG disappointment.  All of the actors involved here should have seriously evaluated the script before accepting their roles.  Are they THAT hard up for a paycheck that they have to do movies that make fun of serious issues like murder?  I believe that it is sick and twisted to find ANY sort of humor in a bunch of characters who keep mercilessly killing and act like they are still at their college frat party afterwards.  There is NO HUMOR in the graphic, bloody, violent scenes in this movie.  Perhaps this IS a good date movie, though.

I wonder why I waited until the end to leave. The only saving grace was Cameron Diaz - her opening monologue was brilliant, it showed her skill and development as an actress.  Sadly though after that her character falls to the wayside.As a contrast, Christian Slater resurrected his character from Heathers (a very good performance) and phoned the rest in; I was disappointed because he is a very skilled actor and he made no attempt to give his character any layers or irony (as was true with all the characters).The script was boring, it had no plot and relied on the gore to  carry it through.  The Saw-Z-All was too much. I felt nothing (i.e. sympathy, envy or anything for any of the characters.  It is a simple case of Hollywood wee-nees scoring 'the rad movie deal (dude)' and relying on Cameron Diaz's popularity to bring in people to see her.Finally, this is a movie that wouldn't end, just when you think it's over it keeps going and going and going and...

I hated that film when I first saw it, but when compared to VBT, The Cook  looks like Citizen Kane. At least The Cook had a plausible story, amazing visuals, and Ian Dury getting stabbed in his face with a dinner fork.VBT is shocking, but mainstream shocking.  A hooker dies and they cut her body up.  So what?  Christian Slater then puts on his Jack Nicklson impression.  Boy, THAT's original!I guess this is a black comedy for the South Park generation.

On the comedic side, I think I chuckled twice, maybe three times. The truly funny part was that I didn't walk out after the first five minutes, thinking, hoping that it might get better. It didn't.

That is just wrong  The movie was not funny, not even close to being funny.  You can't compare this movie with There's Something About Mary. One was funny and was was just sick.  The humor in Mary was dark but it was real. The humor in this movie was sick and demented. There is nothing funny about murder and death no matter how it is presented.  Fine, I can live with the fact that this is a truly awful movie but there is something that bothers me more than the content of the movie.  What bothers me is the people who have sent in comments talking about how great this movie is and how funny they thought it was.  What bothers me is the people in the theater who were laughing at the characters dying in very disturbing and graphic ways.  It is a comment on society.  The movie industry has been trivializing death for such a long time that it no longer bothers people to see people die in the movies.  The sad thing is that it also trivializes actual death. Now people could say that it was just a movie and that could never happen, but it already has.  There has been more than one case of someone committing unspeakable crimes for no other reason than it has been done in the movies. These are all great actors in this movie, but I don't understand how they all felt that this was a good movie to make.  I hope they all choose better scripts next time, or at least scripts that say something positive.  This is not a comedy and don't let anyone try to convince you that it is.

(Christian Slater as Boyd).Boyd is an estate agent. He is also a psychopath. Fittingly, given his recent incarceration for violence, Slater is landed the plum role. However, it turns out to be merely an extension of the nutcase he played in Heathers many moons ago. Only not half as good.Very Bad Things is part of a trio (the other two being The Opposite of Sex and Your Friends and Neighbours) of very nasty American independent movies coming out in the next month or so. Like its contemporaries it's memorable and scabrous.The tale concerns a trip to Las Vegas for the boys. Kyle Fisher, Favreau (of Swingers fame), is getting wed to snotty ex-sorority girl Laura (Diaz), but before he takes the plunge Boyd has organised some drugs and frolics in seamy Las Vegas.Accompanied by brothers Adam (Daniel Stern) and Michael (Jeremy Piven) and mute-like Charles (Leland Orser), the big boys' entertainment is abruptly curtailed. Michael, high on coke, has accidentally embedded an Asian (played by real-life porn star Kobe Tai, a.k.a. Carla Scott) prostitute's head to a coat-hook in the bathroom. This is a truly gruesome scene that is interspersed quite cleverly with the revolting sight of two wrestlers on the TV. Noticeably, Berg's direction lingers very uncomfortably on her naked corpse.The boys panic and before you can say blood bath, Boyd misuses a corkscrew on a hotel security guard, leaving him wailing like a pig, before, inevitably, slaughtering him. He duly announces Surrender is no longer an option.This kicks-off a lot of histrionic yelling and a burial scene reminiscent of Shallow Grave - shopping for equipment, decapitation and dismemberment. Aiming for humour, these scenes flop laugh-wise. Left in the hands of Tarantino or the Coen brothers, these sequences may have succeeded, but in Very Bad Things there is far too much screaming going on. The Coens would have tempered the chaos and brutality with pathos or a hint of humanity. Director Berg aims hard for cool, but only achieves bad imitation.After the horror of Vegas, the utterly charmless set of businessmen return to their suburban homes and go swiftly mad. What ensues is a series of events reminiscent of the classic Ladykillers, interspersed with the occasional witty line. Diaz, in particular, gets some fine dialogue The scent of cheap hotel's whore's sex and No one is going to rob me of the wedding I've waited 27 years to have. Slater also gets a couple of good scenes where he takes corporate business logic to an insane limit I'm a lighthouse, I never go dark.Ultimately, Very Bad Things is disjointed, mildly irritating, far more violent than the pilloried and much finer Natural Born Killers, contains obnoxious characters and receives a rather good finale that it doesn't really deserve. A film that illustrates just how clever the likes Tarantino, John Dahl, The Coens and David Lynch really are.

There was nothing redeeming about any of the characters and nothing gratifying about the events other than the pain and suffering which is visited upon the main characters, which they so dearly deserved. The characters were obviously intended to be average Joes, whom we can all identify with, put into a difficult situation.  But no, moderation was not in the writer's vocabulary and everything was taken entirely too far.  The characters came off looking more like heartless, spineless, murderers who draw no sympathy whatsoever from the audience.  In fact, by about midway through the film I was hoping each and every one of them would take a bullet. Now on the flip side of all that, I reluctantly admit that I actually found myself enjoying some of the movie, in spite of myself.  Maybe I just have a sick mind, but if the author intended it to be a dark comedy, he might have at least been headed in the right direction.  I did find myself amused throughout the movie, though often times I wasn't sure if I was laughing because it was funny or because I had no idea what to make of the violence and gore. This is the kind of movie that you will walk away from scratching your head, wondering what it was you just watched.  If you like movies that walk the line between comedy and trash, this certainly qualifies.  But unless you have a ruthlessly sick sense of humor, steer clear of this movie. "}]
