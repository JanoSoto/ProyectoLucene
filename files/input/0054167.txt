Emerging during the War as one of Britain's finest craftsmen, Powell and his partner Emeric Pressburger created the undisputed classics The Life And Death Of Colonel Blimp (1943), Black Narcissus (1947) and The Red Shoes (1948).But despite critical and commercial success, his career was in tatters by the early 1960's.  The abrupt death of Powell's career can virtually be pinned down to one film, his most uncompromising portrait of madness, 1960's Peeping Tom.Powell's infamous shocker opens with a movie camera-wielding Mark Lewis (Carl Boehm) following a prostitute to her boarding house room. Once inside, he slides a spike from his tripod leg and films her action of terror before stabbing her to death. As the credits roll, we find Mark alone in his apartment, replaying the footage with wide-eyed fascination.As the film progresses, Mark is revealed as a stuttering loner whose sex drive has been somehow twisted into a murderous voyeuristic mania - working at a movie studio by day, he moonlights as a &#145;glamour' photographer above a seedy newsagents. His blonde buxom model (Pamela Green), constantly taunting his virility, is the embodiment of the female he despises. The inquisitive girl downstairs, on the other hand, becomes his ideal and his possible salvation. Ultimately she is doomed by her altruistic attraction when she insists Mark must show her one of his 'films'. Horrified, she watches Mark as a child, tortured by his father's camera experiment of recording a child's reaction to fear. Mark's own experiment of filming his murder victims leads him on a downward spiral of insanity to the film's tragic conclusion.Despite Peeping Tom's sensational subject matter, Powell's intention was deadly serious to make a sober study of sexual violence, as well as a meditation on the audience's role of voyeur. Powell's camera positions us directly behind Mark and his spectators so that we become his unwilling accomplices - the audience watches Mark watching his films. Carl Boehm as Mark gives a chilling performance, at once icy reserve and murderous rage. Powell creates a garish red and pale blue twilight landscape of backstreet London in perfect detail. At the film's completion, Powell believed he had made a masterpiece. Peeping Tom is certainly a personal film; Powell and his co-scriptwriter toiled for months until they had mastered a sympathetic three-dimensional serial killer. In later years, Powell would remain tight-lipped about his real reasons for making the film. But Britain's premiere 'glamour' pinup queen Pamela Green - Peeping Tom's photo-model and penultimate victim - would offer clues to Powell's hidden agenda.Green became his leading choice for the role, although she had not appeared outside 8mm stag films, after seeing a life-sized nude portrait in her business partner Harrison Mark's studio. Her initial reception on the set was one of polite British reserve - until Powell unleashed his Jekyll and Hyde personality and she became one among many targets for his boorish, intimidating manner. On the day of Green's death scene, Powell changed his former plans of prudence and demanded she sprawl topless across her bed before she is skewered with Mark's tripod leg. She reluctantly gave in. Mid-shot she looked across the studio in horror. Beneath Powell's camera were his two pre-teen sons, watching unwaveringly according to their father's instructions. This incident brought a chill over Powell's casting of his son as Mark junior and of himself as Mark's father.Whatever reasons drove Powell to make Peeping Tom, he had effectively signed his career's death warrant. The film opened to scathing reviews in April 1960, just months after the similarly-themed Psycho. Ironically, Hitchcock floated out of the controversy surrounding Psycho as the consummate old trickster, and saved his slowly sinking career.  The time seemed ripe for Peeping Tom among audiences and critics alike. Unfortunately for Powell, the critics could find none of Psycho's black humour in his sober tome. 'Sick' and &#145;vile' were a small sample of their vitriol. The papers were outraged that a filmmaker of Powell's calibre could sink his talents into material so vulgar and perverse. Powell hoped the distributor would weather the storm and allow the audience to find the film on its own merits. Instead, the plug was pulled on Peeping Tom after five days and at least in Britain the film was buried.The print was sold to the American Roadshow circuit, with a lurid ad campaign designed to sell the film to a jaded American public. Shorn of twenty minutes footage, the film was considered too 'British' and was shelved after a limited run. There it sat, gathering dust for almost 20 years. Then in 1978 a cabal of admiring filmmakers led by Martin Scorsese (himself no stranger to controversy) rescued a complete print from Britain.  Peeping Tom was thus relaunched in 1979 at the prestigious New York Film Festival to a predictably mixed reception. Correct-minded commentators grudgingly accepted its 'masterpiece' tag but were nonplussed with the Film's treatment of its sexual violence.As for Powell, the British film industry no longer considered him bankable after Peeping Tom. He made one more film in Britain before exiling himself to Australia. The antipodean They're A Weird Mob (1966) was on of his final films before his death in 1984. Luckily for Powell, the film he considers his masterpiece is still revered and reviled, but no longer ignored.

Innocent love stories, historical epics, action-packed westerns and colourful musicals were the staple cinematic diet of the time, certainly not dark, disturbing and intensely violent murder thrillers like this. What probably unsettled contemporary film-goers even more was the fact that a film of this kind could come from a much-loved and revered director like Michael Powell. In modern times, the equivalent would be if Steven Spielberg were to make a graphic and reviled film about paedophilia or bestiality, consequently never being allowed to stand behind a movie camera again. When Peeping Tom hit the big screen, it was rejected by the public and crucified by the critics, and left Powell's hitherto glorious career in ruin.A film cameraman, Mark Lewis (Karl Boehm), displays psychotic tendencies as he murders women with a spiked tripod attached to the bottom of his camera, capturing on celluloid their final screams of agony. It is revealed that when he was a child, Mark was used as a guinea pig by his father (Michael Powell) in a series of psychoanalytical experiments about the symptoms of fear. Among other things, Mark's delightful dad would wake him throughout the night and shine lights in his eyes, drop lizards into his bed, and on one occasion even forced him to pose for photographs next to the dead body of his mother. As a result, Mark has an unhealthy obsession with fear and, in particular, the expression that people have on their face during moments of fear.Peeping Tom is one of the few films that still has the power to shock all these years on. Psycho, released roughly at the same time, is still a great film but its shock value has been diminished by years of repeat viewings and increasing permissiveness in the cinema. But Peeping Tom is an altogether more disturbing piece of work. Boehm is excellent as the killer whose entire outlook has been skewed by his father's experiments. Also impressive is Anna Massey as the killer's fragile and unsuspecting fianc√©e. Powell directs the film brilliantly, using bold and dazzling colours to disguise the horrific atrocities that punctuate his film. It is understandable that the film was met with revulsion and rejection at that time, but in retrospect it is a film of real importance and power. In a 21st century world bombarded and desensitised by harrowing images on the news and in the movies, the theme of losing one's grasp on what is and isn't morally acceptable is more pertinent than ever. This is not easy viewing, but it IS essential viewing.

The phrase snuff films hadn't even been invented in 1960, nor did videotape cameras exist, so the movie was far in advance of its time. You might be disappointed if you looking for pure excitement, you have to be willing to examine deeper issues.Carl Bohm is perfect in the role of the killer, and his faint German accent (which might be interpreted as a. psychogenic speech defect) adds to the creepiness of his character. Instead of an over-the-top maniac (Jack Nicholson, are you listening?), he portrays a frightened and insecure little person who can only relate to the world by looking at it, preferably through a camera lens. It is easy to condemn him for his obsession with peeping, but -um- aren't we doing the same thing by watching this movie, or any movie? The most interesting movies are those that  provoke such questions in us. This aspect also helps explain why Peeping Tom was so fiercely condemned in 1960.(The scenes between Bohm and Massey remind me of those between Gustav Diesel and Louise Brooks in the last part of Pandora's Box (1928), and you can bet the Michael Powell was familiar with Pabst's work.)The idea that scrutiny = punishment was explored by Michel Foucault in his book Surveiller et Punir, which I happened to read a long time ago. We will be finding out more about  this as the National Security State draws closer. Anyway, here you have a powerless little guy who tries to feel the same sense of control by turning  his camera - literally - into a murder-weapon. The technical details of this contrivance seem unrealistic, but the symbolism is so powerful they scarcely matter.The hard-edged sound of late-50s cool jazz works very nicely in setting the atmosphere, similar to Town Without Pity (1960). Nowadays we tend to think of that era as idyllic, so its useful to remind ourselves of the dark edges that existed.

In fact, it's a shame this was almost the last film he directed before going on to a kind of exile in Australia.Peeping Tom is an exercise in voyeurism Mr. Powell, and his screen writer, Leo Marks, created to prove to what extent how one is capable of watching things one shouldn't watch. At the same time, Mr. Powell created a psychological essay about what makes Mark Lewis, the central character of the film, act the way he acted. Mark has been scarred for life thanks to what his own father did to him during a period of his growing years that formed his character into the reclusive man who feels at home doing the despicable crimes he commits.One of the strengths of the film is the amazing portrayal of Mark Lewis by the German actor, Carl Boehm, who made a superb contribution to the movie. Mr. Boehm is perfect because by just looking at him, one would never guess what's inside his soul, or what motivates him to kill and record his crimes.Mr. Powell brought together an amazing cast that shines in the film. Moira Shearer, Anna Massey, Maxime Audley, Brenda Bruce, Bartlett Mullins, are among the most prominent players one sees in the film.The newly restored copy we saw as part of the retrospective shown at the Walter Reade this year has been enhanced in ways one didn't think would be possible and it's a tribute to the great director, who should have been proud of how today's audiences are reacting when they discover his movies that seem will live forever.It's ironic that Mr. Powell didn't get the recognition he deserved during his lifetime.

Even good films like 'Seven' and 'Silence of the Lambs' have a regretable tendency toward melodrama and gross overacting in the portrayal of serial killers.  'John Doe' (Kevin Spacey) and 'Buffalo Bill' (Ted Levine) are laughable travesties of their real life counterparts, who seem harmless when approaching or luring a potential victim.One of the things that critics of his time could not forgive Powell is that he makes his killer 'Mark Lewis' (Karl Boehm) human and likeable.  a sensitive and intelligent young man, he is the product of bestial cruelty inflicted upon him in childhood (the scenes showing film of him being tortured as a boy by his scientist father are horrifying in the true sense of the word)This is a sophisticated film demanding of the viewer that he or she not only takes part in watching a compelling thriller but are also provoked into contemplating the forces that work on a man who commits such crimes.After watching 'Peeping Tom' one does not have the customary closure common in such thrillers of seeing a 'monster' the viewer could not emphasise with destroyed and the world made safe again, (much the theory behind the justification of capital punishment).  Rather we have the experience of seeing the tragic self destruction of a man arguably as much a victim as those he killed.To critics this was reprehensible - 'siding with the murderer'.  The man who wrote the script, however, knew at first hand what makes a killer - since he was responsible for selecting secret agents to fight behind enemy lines in World War 2.  He had to choose men - and women - who would not hesitate to kill.

(Not that there are any twists in the plot - my uncertainty was of a different kind.)  I think this made me all the more delighted when I at last found out.Although it was made without co-archer Emeric Pressburger, we see the old Archers' logo at the start; except that this time it's overlaid with `A Michael Powell Production' - in tiny letters.  This gave me a pang of sadness.  `Peeping Tom' all but completely destroyed Powell's career; and however much and for whatever reasons critics and audiences may have loathed the film, this simply ought not have happened - especially since, good or bad, it's manifestly the work of a director at the height of his powers.  The photography is wonderfully assured, the colours are as bright and stark and controlled and fantastic as ever, the script is clever and trusts to our intelligence, and Powell still knows how to keep our minds glued to the screen even when our eyes tell us that nothing much is happening.  Every scene is unsettling.  Most are creepy.I could go on about the technical details - the use of sound and music is amazingly innovative, too - but what really elevates `Peeping Tom', what makes so many of the contemporary criticisms absurd, is its compassion.  There's none of that watered-down Freudian guff we encounter in `Psycho'.  Powell makes us feel for his serial killer - not so much by showing us that he feels pain but by showing us that he has ordinary, likeable human qualities as well as madness.  A number of Powell's war-time said the same thing about Nazis.  It's clear that he really meant it.Not that this is an overt message of `Peeping Tom', and not that there aren't a lot of other things going on as well.  I not only recommend, I BEG, that any admirer of Powell's earlier work give this one a try as well.  Since Powell is striking out in a new direction there's an excellent chance you won't like it; but it deserves to be tried.

The clever films within the film, puns, raw Freudian imagery, the bold acting and the way the plot unfolds as logically as a fable kept me enthralled through to the end.  I tried watching it again last night and I couldn't shake an absolutely crushing sadness that emanates from Mark Lewis.  He's like some aborted twin of the director in 8 1/2.  But whereas Guido's creative instinct and drive emerged from a house full of women pampering him and a magical incantation that he was told will animate an ominous painting, Mark's is a murderous urge to have some of the control and power denied him by his father.  Like a record stuck playing the same sound over and over, Mark has grown into an emotional cul-de-sac where he watches the story of his torture and his revenge every night.  Mark is trying to work his way out of this loop by filming a documentary.  If he can create a record of sadistic control over everything around himself, maybe the act of making a story out of his life will at least give him an end to his suffering.  The frenzied excitement, practically joy, of his suicide is a miserable thing to contemplate.  He says that he's spent a long time preparing his walkway of cameras to capture his final rush to meet the fate he inflicted on so many others.  At previous points in the film, he's noted that he expected to get caught and it's clear he's very happy to have been revealed in exactly the circumstances he staged.  His documentary is a success.  Mark tries to develop a world outside of the documentary that he knows will kill him.  He talks to the psychologist about getting help and his expression clearly indicates that he just can't see giving years of therapy a chance.  Mark's clumsy and sincere attempts to develop a normal relationship with Helen fall into the same category - it would be so nice, but he's got something he has to do.  Something creative, albeit monstrous, hardwired into Mark has to express itself `regardless of the consequences.'As with other Michael Powell films, it's not for all audiences.  Powell tells his stories with lavish color-coded signals, revels in dramatic extremes, and is unapologetic about pulling dirty tricks like dragging out Moira Shearer's death scene to the point where 1) you fully realize that Mark is an exacting composer and 2) you long for him to get on with it and kill her already.  Like everything else filmed before 1999 (when The Matrix set the current standard for believable CGI and HBO programming made R-rated material ho-hum), the fx/gore do not live up to contemporary expectations.

While I do think that comparisons to its contemporary PSYCHO (1960) are a bit tenuous, it has to be said that both films can be thought of as belonging to the horror genre &#150; in fact, PEEPING TOM was the third British slasher movie in a row, following HORRORS OF THE BLACK MUSEUM (1959) and CIRCUS OF HORRORS (1960) - but can also lay claim to being a very dark sort of black comedy. Besides, both films feature dysfunctional, immature, adult male protagonists haunted by a terrible upbringing which vents itself in a series of murders. Furthermore, while both films have been harshly reviled by critics when first released, in time, they have had their reputations make a complete about face and nowadays are numbered among their respective directors' unassailable masterpieces!

It has certainly retained the power to shock over four decades later, and leaves the viewer with more questions than have been answered during the fairly short running time.Carl Boehm plays Mark Lewis, a focus puller at a film studio who feeds his voyeuristic tendencies by filming people everyone he goes.  This preoccupation takes a disturbing twist in his need to kill, and film women as he kills them.  So far, so unsavoury.  Mark appears on the surface as a personable young man who just has this dangerous, psychotic tendency he can't always keep in check.  The audience is thus invited to have some sympathy with him, especially after the discovery that the young Mark was the focus for his father's experiments on the nature of fear in children (show in part as the film within the film featuring Michael Powell and his son Columba), and was filmed and recorded for the whole of his young life. No wonder, the film is saying, that he has grown into this disturbed person who has no real life away from either recording things on a camera, or watching the results in his darkened room.Anna Massey has perhaps the prime female role in the film, as Mark's downstairs neighbour Helen Stephens.  She is both repelled and attracted by Mark's movie-making, and perhaps she is closer to him that she would herself admit.  It is a restrained performance of considerable power.  Moira Shearer has a brief appearance as the studio stand-in who becomes his victim, while Shirley Anne Field provides light relief as the film actress who can never get her lines right and doesn't know how to faint on camera.&#145;Peeping Tom' is a clever piece of work which perhaps came too soon to be acceptable to the establishment.  After all, during Powell's collaborations with Emeric Pressburger, they often pushed their luck with their subject matter and the way they presented it.  This film was the natural progression of that anarchistic spirit.  It is humorous in places &#150; Mark is not presented as a one-dimensional monster &#150; while being a very dark and disturbing psychological thriller throughout.

However, despite this respectable profession, Lewis has a more sinister side to him. When he was a child his father who was a celebrated scientist (played by Michael Powell himself) used him as a puppet for his experiments into fear. As a result, Lewis grew up to be a psychopathic killer who stalks his victims and films the fear on his victims faces as he kills them.Anglo-Amalgamated invested $560,000 into the making of this picture, which was more than they had ever spent on a single movie before. The company produced other horror movies such as HORRORS OF THE BLACK MUSEUM (1959 Arthur Crabtree) and CIRCUS OF HORRORS (1960 Sydney Hayers). Both of these films had a certain notoriety at the time especially the former with it's sequence where a girl looks into a pair of binoculars and spikes shoot out straight into her eyes. However, PEEPING TOM has a reputation as the most notorious film in the history of British cinema because of it's story about a particularly lethal form of voyeurism. As a result, director Michael Powell who was the acclaimed director of such prestige British films as A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH (1946 co-directed with Emeric Pressburger) had to leave the country and find work in Australia. Today the film is regarded as a masterpiece by people like Martin Scorcese and the noted film critic Dilys Powell who gave the film a scaving review at the time, but she later came round and called it a masterpiece.Viewed today, PEEPING TOM is a masterwork thanks to Powell's impeccable direction and great performances from Boehm as the disturbed Lewis, Anna Massey as his neighbour and girlfriend Helen Stephens and Moira Shearer is also brilliant as Helen's blind mother who suspects that Lewis isn't quite right from the start even though she lost her sight during an operation. Also deserving praise is Otto Heller whose Eastmancolor photography is outstanding with none of that awful day for night stuff. PEEPING TOM isn't a graphically violent film, in fact there isn't a spot of blood anywhere but one can see why the film caused such an uproar at the time as it really is a disturbing story. Yet thanks to the distinguished people involved, the story is told with a measure sympathy for it's troubled killer (even though it never justifies his actions) and if any one else (well almost anyone else) other than Powell had directed it - the film would be nothing more than exploitation rubbish!

Many critics and audiences weren't ready for this type of groundbreaking disturbance (I doubt they even are nowadays), which regretfully meant an unfair boycott of the film, as well as of its genius director Michael Powell. The magnificence of Peeping Tom almost can't be described in words, since it's so all embracing and frighteningly up-to-date. Every single detail in the production&#133;every single line in the script&#133;every single movement by the actors & actresses reaches damn close to perfection. It already starts with a controversial &#150; but hugely courageous &#150; basic premise Scoptophelia, or the morbid desire to watch, as explained by a psychiatrist in the film. Mark Lewis, the main character, can't live without registering everything he sees on camera. This hardly causes any problems in his daily life, as he works in the film-industry and gains some extra cash as the photographer of nude-pictures. But the complexity of Mark's persona doesn't stop there. He constantly struggles with childhood traumas, brought on by his scientist-father who always used Mark as a guinea pig for his own psychological research regarding the study of human fear. As a result of these inhuman tests, Mark grew up a very timid and introvert man...but simultaneously with an insane and restless mind that can only be calmed down by committing gruesome murders...As you can read all over the Internet, Peeping Tom is often mentioned in one sentence along with Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, released the same year. Supposedly because together they dragged horror-cinema into the present tense by introducing villains that show no obvious physical characteristics like these of typical horror monsters and mass-murderers. Indeed so, Norman Bates as well as Mark Lewis are both ordinary and colorless men that turn out mankind's most bizarre perverts, but that's pretty much where the comparison stops. Peeping Tom continues in intensity and controversy where Psycho eventually throws the towel in the ring. Other than Mark Lewis being a highly unlikely killer, the script successfully covers psychological eeriness (Mark's childhood is far more shocking than that of Norman Bates) AND the alarming confrontation with the omnipresent theme of voyeurism. The uncontrollable desire of observing people is of all ages, but an incredible taboo around the time this film got released. The prudishness and hypocrisy of society is masterfully illustrated near the beginning of the film, when a seemly prominent citizen quietly requests pictures of sexily dressed women in a newspaper shop. If you see how embarrassed he is for buying sexy pictures, you get an idea of how awry and difficult it must have been to shoot a film that actually puts the viewer in the position of a voyeur.Apart from being very intelligent, very influential and very complex&#133; Peeping Tom of course also is VERY frightening! Not in the least because of Carl Boehm's creepy performance (I can't believe the same guy played the fancy and well-behaving Austrian Prince in my mother's favorite epic film-series Sissi &#150; Die Junge Kaiserin!!!), but also because of the depressing atmosphere and the slow pacing. Not a single drop of blood is shed throughout the entire film, and yet I rarely felt this uncomfortable upon seeing simple 'suggestions'. Watching Peeping Tom feels like unintentionally crashing into the set of a snuff film and the only thing you can do is to close your eyes. But&#133;can you? Or, even worse, &#133;do you want to?

Perhaps the most unsettling thing about Peeping Tom is that Mark actually isn't a bad guy. He isn't inherently evil -- he is simply a man that has become so consumed by his predilections and cerebral trauma that there's no turning back. Karlheinz B√∂hm (credited as Carl Boehm) gives a chilling and understated performance in this role. The actor portrays Mark as a stammering, nervous, awkward, and insecure fellow in the vein of Anthony Perkins' Norman Bates. He doesn't trust himself any more than we trust him. Because Mark is a fully-developed human being rather than a knife-wielding caricature, we become sympathetic towards him, to the extent that we are almost complicit in his murderous affairs -- certainly a disturbing experience with which audiences in 1960 likely didn't know how to cope. B√∂hm is supported by a game cast, including the winsome Anna Massey as the doe-eyed heroine and Maxine Audley as her mother (in a particularly eerie and poignant turn). The proceedings are buoyed by sumptuous cinematography and lighting design, which impart portentous feelings of dread and mystique.Sadly, Peeping Tom is also known for destroying the career of director Powell, who simply made the right movie at the wrong time. Imagine the penury that Alfred Hitchcock would have faced if Psycho were filmed in color!

Peeping Tom is a film about scopophilia, or the desire or urge to gaze at the intimate, the forbidden, the unattainable. It's main character, Mark, is a troubled but brilliant young man who for the most part leads a reserved life--he works focus on movie sets (the irony is intended), he lives a quiet life upstairs in his father's old house (he has tenants pay the rent), and he's really shy (which is why he doesn't meet the cute young lady who lives under his very house until after the movie starts). He also kills people by stabbing them with a tripod connected to a movie camera he totes around all day. The big skill in this movie, though, is that that's just the thing the emphasis is his shy sensibilities, his humanity, and his intelligence. The fact that he's a murderer is made all the more disturbing by how attractive and relatable he is.Now, I understand that that approach has been done before, but here it reaches a new synthesis. First of all, Carl Boehm's acting--Mark isn't just a character you can relate to, he's a character you recognize in your peers, on the street, in yourself. Secondly, Michael Powell's directing, which is second in Britain only to Hitchcock (and Hitchcock moved to America, so really it's second-to-none at this point), is solidly built around bringing the viewer into a magical, open world, only this time it's one that's more likely to shock than amaze. Thirdly, many horror movies use self-reflexivity in the use of cameras and the focus on the entertainment observed in horror movies to make a point about the nature of the violence and the audience's relationship to it, but this movie goes beyond that by introducing sound, set-design, and other parts of film-making that most self-reflexive movies bypass or ignore. Even better, it's subtle--Mark claims only to be looking for a specific image, and the drama is his attempt to find it. It is not Mark making the movie that we're watching.The approach was so subtle and effective, it almost ended Powell's career. Apparently audiences couldn't handle a monster they could relate to, their own liability in the action, and an utterly believable story of a person driven to do something he soberly knows is wrong. Worse, it's moments of Freudian or psychoanalytic explanation is more compelling than, for instance, Psycho, which came out the same year. Even today, when we've moved slightly beyond Freud, this movie is scoff-free.--PolarisDiB "},{"Title":"Snore","Date":"2 June 2006","Score":"16 out of 28 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Thriller","Review":" I have been of two minds about Michael Powell, ever since I discovered that I couldn't understand how The Red Shoes would make any little girl want to be a ballerina--any more than I have never been able to figure out how The Little Prince or The Velveteen Rabbit could be liked by anyone under 30.Having just watched Colonel Blimp and Black Narcissus, both of which are certifiable masterpieces, I think thatPeeping Tom obviously shows the want of a Pressburger to make it a viable product. It's just plain bad. Bad cinematography, bad acting, bad screenplay, bad choice of material. Were this the film by which Powell is judged, he would be compared to Ed Wood. I know Martin Scorsese likes this movie, but for the life of me I can't figure out why.I understand that this film has been compared to Psycho. Can't figure that one out, either.Peeping Tom does bear comparison to a Hitchcock film, however Frenzy, the only one of Hitch's films whose trailer is better than the movie, and the only one in which Hitch resorted to cheap effects, including the choice of a bad musical score, gratuitous nudity, and that ludicrous shot of Barbara Leigh-Hunt's corpse. Powell doesn't quite go that far, simply showing the protagonist, Mark Lewis, played by Carl Boehm, unsheathing his hidden tripod spike to stab his victims in the throat. Powell used a stag film star as one of the victims, which I guess was kind of louche, and therefore attractive to some.The overall cheapness of the project, despite the use of Anna Massey and Moira Shearer, contributes to the overall tawdriness of Peeping Tom. While I certainly number some low- budget masterpieces among my favorites, it's obvious that Powell took some awful short- cuts in making this one, and never asked his actors to provide anything like acting.The plot of Peeping Tom is outlined elsewhere on this web page, and I don't feel it necessary to duplicate the efforts of others. I would like to see some of the later Powell efforts, especially Age of Consent and the two Pressburger collaborations in Australia from the 1970's, but I think none of these probably rises to the heights Powell and Pressburger reached in the 40's and 50's. There's some great Powell out there; however, undiscriminating praise of his art does him no favor. If Criterion is going to bother to release Peeping Tom, I think it might behoove them to release some of Anthony Asquith's previously unreleased (At lease in America) films, like The Way to the Stars.

He lives in the house that he inherited from his parents, and rents to tenants to help him pay the bills and keep the building. Mark was the subject of bizarre experiments of effects of the fear conducted by his scientist father when he was a child, and since has become obsessed by the faces of frightened women in the moment of death. He kills women, filming their face, so they can see their fear. When Mark meets his neighbour and tenant Helen on her birthday, he befriends her and soon becomes intimate. Mark has become infatuated with Helen, and begins to become even more unhinged......Powell risked his illustrious career with this movie, and all it's controversy and lambasting it received on its initial release has only helped its cause as the years have passed.It's a very unnerving film to say the least, because unlike other films in this genre, we are with Mark for the duration of the narrative, other characters are in the film to either help, hinder, vex, or endear him, thus making him the hero of the film, the only character you can really show empathy for.And this is why the film is so disturbing, Powell has made a film where all the characters are highly unlikeable dirty and insufferable, so in many instances, Mark is the hero, and you find yourself justifying his actions, because of his suffering, because of his isolation, and most of all, his choice of employment.It's a shocking movie that paved the way for many films that have referenced many of its scenes, and characters.Not comfortable viewing by any means, but essential.Would make a great companion piece with Blow up and Frenzy.

Mark carries his sturdy Bell & Howell 8mm movie camera around with him at all times as if it was part of, or connected to, his body. What Mark also has is a deep dark obsession of photographing women whom he, in order to get the very full impact, murders as they realize their about to be run through with a steel spike attached to his movie camera!Peeping Tom is the obvious British version of the American horror classic Paycho. The movie even has an Alfred Hitchcock look-alike Milles Malleson in the film in what seems to be its imitating the great directors, of the film Psycho, cameo scene in it.Mark against his better judgment ends up getting very friendly with one of the tenants in his boarding house, that he inherited from his late father, mosey Helen Stephens, Anna Massey, who seems to be just crazy about him. Not at all unattractive Mark despite his shyness and insecurity with the opposite sex looks like a very young Robert Redford! Which make it very believable that a girl like Helen would go for the guy without her knowing what a real grade triple A nut-case he really is.We soon find out that Mark's problems originated when he mother died and left him at the mercy of his crack pot father, a doctor of the human mind, who got him into photography as well as voyeurism. It was over the years that Mark developed a strong relationship with his movie camera that prevented him from having any real relationships with people that he came in contact with. This mental aberration lead Mark to become crazy in the fact that he ended up murdering a number of women, and photographing them as he butchered them, just to satisfy his sick voyeuristic craving!It was Helen who in fact brought the best out of Mark in him hesitating to murder her when he had the chance in that she was just about the only person, in treating Mark like a normal human being, who cared about him. It was this spark of humanity that in fact lead to Mark's demise as he used the very same tactic to do himself in, when he realized that he's going to be caught by the police, that he used on his victims.Far more effective now then it was at the time of its release back in 1960 Peeping Tom had the misfortune of being ahead of its time not only in its depiction of psychological and mental illnesses but how they affect persons, like Mark Lewis, who suffer from them.

"},{"Title":"Britain's 'Psycho' - A Fairly Agreeable Statement.","Date":"24 December 2007","Score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Thriller","Review":" Peeping Tom centers on Mark Lucas (Carl Boehm), a fashion/film photographer who is quiet and rather self-reserved. But despite his calm, quiet appearance, Mark finds joy in murdering women, while filming the horrible deed. When he becomes involved with a woman for the first time, she begins to suspect that something isn't all quite right... and despite her attempts to help him, Mark continues murdering innocent body doubles on his latest film project with the spear-ended leg of his tripod camera.With its retro-style and overall bizarre story, Peeping Tom is an oddball little British thriller that seems to have slipped through the cracks of cinema and hasn't been seen by many. Notoriously controversial and apparently banned, the themes in this film, primarily being voyeurism and murder, are rather heavy, and were especially so for the time it was made. The movie begins with quite a punch-in-the- gut, with a disturbing murder of a prostitute from the killer's camera lens point-of-view. The opening sets the mood for the rest of the film, and I thought the film sustained tension very well, managing to be creative at the same time.There's something about a man obsessed with murdering beautifully-clad women that is extremely sinister, much less filming the crimes, which takes it to an even more disturbing level. The mixed themes of voyeurism, obsession, and murderous impulses is thrown together nicely in the script, and Boehm plays the part extremely well, being reserved and quiet, but appropriately creepy and evoking that feeling that something isn't quite right with him. His character, and the fact that Peeping Tom was released in 1960 as well, is probably what has lead to so many comparisons between this and Hitchock's Psycho. While they do have their similarities, I see Psycho and Peeping Tom as two quite different movies.The main difference is that Peeping Tom focuses mostly from the psychopath's point of view, and more insight is given into his life and disturbing childhood throughout the film's duration, rather than the villain's psyche being wrapped up by a monologue as in Psycho. In that respect, I find Peeping Tom to be a stronger film because the audience can sympathize with the character much more. Both films have their strong and weak points, but it is safe to say that if there ever was a British Psycho, it was most definitely this movie, although I see them as quite different films. My only real complaint with this movie would be that it seems to drag its heels a few times, but all things considered, it is a satisfying horror filmOverall, Peeping Tom is a far above-average psycho-thriller that has managed to sustain its disturbing nature for over forty years. There are quite a few chilling scenes, and Carl Boehm's portrayal of the psychotic photographer is spot-on. If you are a fan of Hitchock's Psycho, it's safe to say you'll likely enjoy this movie, if not more than Psycho. As for myself, I cannot decide between the two, but I can say that both are very excellent and important horror pieces. 8/10, pushing a 9. "}{"Title":"A true masterpiece of horror and suspense!","Date":"30 October 2007","Score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Thriller","Review":" Without a doubt, 1960 was a year of numerous and important changes in the history of cinema, specially in the horror genre, as with the beginning of the end of the Production Code, new and different ideas began to be explored within the genre's conventions. One of those was the introduction of complex psychological themes and sexual overtones, inaugurating what is now known as psychological horror with movies like 1959's Horrors of the Black Museum and Hitchcock's 1960 masterpiece, Psycho, which gave a human face to the monsters of horror movies (as previously most were of supernatural origin). Another of those significant movies that helped to change the genre in the 60s is without a doubt Michael Powell's Peeping Tom, a morbid tale of horror and suspense about voyeurism that follows that very same path of psychological horror and, like Psycho (released three months after Peeping Tom), elevates it to an art-form.Peeping Tom is the story of Mark Lewis (Karlheinz B√∂hm), a young focus puller in a British film studio who aspires to become a filmmaker himself. A shy and lonely man, Lewis is not very social, and prefers to spend his time with his camera, working as a photographer of pornographic pictures of women. However, this young man has another secret, and that is that he is actually a serial killer who films and murders young women, the same that the police has been looking out for weeks. Things get complicated when he meets Helen Stephens (Anna Massey), a young woman who lives downstairs with her mother (Maxine Audley) in a room they rent to Mark. Soon, her friendship begins to mean a lot to Mark, as she offers him an honest understanding he had never had before. However, the shadow of Mark's traumas and obsessions is always present, and he'll have a hard time facing his demons.Written by former cryptographer Leo Marks (albeit Powell had a hand in the script as well), Peeping Tom is a deep and disturbing journey through the darkest sides of the mind as it's entirely focused on Mark as the main character. Unlike Hitchcock's Psycho (a movie often compared to Peeping Tom), the serial killer is not seen through the eyes of those around him, in this film we are living the story entirely from his perspective, discovering the person behind the psychopath personality as well as the reasons behind such a disturbed mind. In a way, it's a deeper humanization of the serial killer character, although interestingly, it doesn't attempt to glorify him or justify him (like posterior movies of the same type did), as the movie centers on his attempt to stop doing what he knows is wrong and his desire to have a normal life.Using a strikingly beautiful color cinematography (by Otto Heller) and a remarkably skillful use of the first person viewpoint, director Michael Powell conceives Peeping Tom as a bizarre chant to the voyeur we all have inside, and the pleasure we get from watching others. It's not for nothing that our central character is a filmmaker himself, as the concept of filming a person becomes one with the concept of killing one, as like some have done before (Bu√±uel for example), the camera is taken as an aggressive, almost physically violent entity that invades and steals the life essence of the person filmed. However, it's not only Powell's use of cinematography what shines in Peeping Tom, his overall use of suspense in the creation of his scenes plays a major role in this highly atmospheric movie where one can almost feel the tension that fills Mark's mind at every step.And this takes us to the cast, which under Powell's direction deliver for the most part excellent performances. Karlheinz B√∂hm is truly the highlight of the film, as his acting as Mark is instrumental for the success of the movie. Making a very real and believable character, B√∂hm transmits perfectly how insecure and vulnerable his character is deep inside, giving definitely one of the best performances in a horror movie ever done. As Helen, the young girl who befriends Mark, Anna Massey is simply perfect, as she perfectly portrays the naivet√© of the character, as well as the innocence that leaves a profound effect on Mark's psyche. As Helen's mother, Maxine Audley is effective and has a couple of excellent scenes, although it must be said that the film ultimately belongs to B√∂hm and Massey, as its their relationship what becomes the central focus of the story.As one can imagine, this movie is not the typical horror movie, it's complex and dark, but also disturbingly very human; definitely not what people expected from director Michael Powell, whom along Emeric Pressburger made some of the most cherished British film of the 50s. This darkness of the subject that Peeping Tom handled was too much for the audiences used to Powell's previous work, and therefore the movie failed commercially and sent Powell's career to oblivion. However, it must be said that none of the problems Peeping Tom had during its release are due to poor film-making, quite the contrary, as this movie ranks easily amongst the most influential horror films ever done, and its commercial failure can only be blamed to the fact that it was ahead of its time. Despite the harsh bashing it received, Powell considered this movie his masterpiece, and I can only agree with him.One of the most interesting (and disturbing) movies about serial killers, Peeping Tom is easily one of the best too. The comparisons with Psycho are fair, albeit this is certainly a different kind of beast, as it's like a deeper, harsher version of the same subject but with less psychology and a lot more of heart. And it's probably this enormous humanity what makes the film so ultimately disturbing. A really influential classic of horror that should be better known in the future as the masterpiece that it is. 9/10 "},{"Title":"Disturbing look at ourselves!","Date":"20 June 2007","Score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Thriller","Review":" This is the first film by Powell I've ever seen and I tell you it won't be the last. Peeping Tom is in my perception the best piece of 1960, a year that produced the ever so famous Psycho and the beautiful Black Sunday. The reason I find Peeping Tom so astounding is that it is the only horror film that disturbed me. There is something in the character of Mark Lewis that really interested me. Maybe it was the fact that he is fascinated at observing people and we are forced to watch him, making us voyeurs. You can't keep your eyes away from the screen because you become fixated and involved. We can't help it, we are just so bewildered and fascinated and therefore we find ourselves identifying with Mark. He can't help it either! And for some reason this revolted and sickened critics in 1960, who made this masterpiece out to be a piece of trash. They were frightened at the notion of sympathizing with Mark, who murders because it has become a fascination that takes him over. He desires to see the look of fear in his victim's eyes. He has no emotional connection to these women. For example, he cannot stand to capture Anna Massey's character on film because he is afraid that he will have to murder her to satisfy his lust. He is fascinated by fear and so is forced to pick up his camera and capture these women's faces at the moment of death. We observe what he observes and so we feel somewhat connected with Mark and that disturbs us. Powell's masterpiece, perhaps his best film of the 1960s, is really about observing. He is trying to tell us that we become voyeurs when we watch a film. We can't keep our eyes away because it fascinates us, just as capturing the fear at the moment of death fascinates Mark. And so it scares us because we can identify with the killer. Peeping Tom is also an extraordinary film because it uses the power of suggestion. We don't see the women been murdered. It is their expressions that really do the trick. Seeing how terrified they are makes us imagine their deaths as truly horrifying. We create the murders in our mind and that makes us feel more connected to Mark. We just see the metal spike at the end of the tripod and the image of it getting closer and closer to one of Mark's victims sends chills down our spine. If Powell has shown the women been murdered the film would be not as effective. If is was soaked in gore and blood it would make us cringe but that would be all. Powell was able to make a film that can disturb 40 years after it has been made. Now that is an accomplishment!Visually the film is like an Argento film at times. In the studio we witness an array of colors, red and green predominantly. This gives this masterpiece a sublime look. The studio is bathed in red, which contrasts to the cold exterior of the world outside it. With Powell's use of color on the studio scenes, I believe he was trying to convey that this is Mark's place were he can create. The film is truly beautiful to behold. It was shot in Eastmancolour so perhaps that is why it is so visually pleasing. It also has an very effective score that is played all on piano. It is not a driving score, but more melancholy, mesmerizing and at times eerie. And that is what Peeping Tom really is Eerie!

Sometimes a controversial film will gain a reputation that it doesn't deserve and I think this is one of those cases. It's greatest flaw probably comes from a puritanical lack of violence. I know that's an odd thing to say about a movie with this kind of reputation, but it's true. Peeping Tom is very violent for a movie released the early 60's, but this shouldn't have been made in the early 60's. It was too soon for a movie like this. The subject matter needed a more explicit approach.Imagine Henry portrait of a serial killer, only without any blood, and every time a murder is about to happen, the camera cuts away or fades out. That's what Peeping Tom is like. It's so well made that you don't really notice this right away and I'm sure it was very shocking to people when it was released... I didn't really begin to realize this was the problem until about half way through the movie but even before that i felt a certain detachment and the movie seemed to lack an emotional punch that should have been there.Hitchcock got around this in psycho with ingenious editing that made the audience believe they were seeing more than they were... Fritz lang does it frequently in movies made even before this through manipulative techniques that cause you to use you imagination to fill in the blanks... Powelll doesn't resort to those kinds of tricks. For one thing it's not really his style and also because peeping tom is a much different kind of film. While psycho is fundamentally a horror film, and most of Fritz Langs more daring efforts are noirish crime thrillers, peeping tom is really more of a morbid character study. A clinical examination of an insane mind. A movie about a killer where the audience views the film from his perspective. A movie like that needs to make the audience feel uncomfortable. You need moments in the film where you are sickened by what you see on screen but peeping tom handles the viewer with kid gloves. That's not really anyone's fault..Peeping Tom is simply a product of it's time and it's one of those cases where they could have made a much better movie about 12 years later. It's rare that i see a movie and my main complaint is that it's too old fashioned, but that's what's wrong with Peeping Tom.There are great scenes though... Moments when you get an idea of what a great movie it could have been, like the scene where the killer is showing his girlfriend home movies from his childhood. We see his father frightening him on purpose and sadistically filming it. It's a graphic demonstration of emotional violence that makes you wince. It's all expertly filmed and edited and it gives you a hint what Powell might have done a few years later.In the end I have to recommend Peeping Tom.. It's certainly worth viewing, but make sure and lower your expectations if you've built it up as some kind of masterpiece.. It's not a masterpiece, it's just excellent, but that's OK.

It stars Carl Boehm, Moira Shearer, Anna Massey, Maxine Audley and Brenda Bruce. Music is by Brian Easdale and cinematography by Otto Heller.A famous (infamous) film for a number of reasons, not least that the fall out from its release effectively finished the career of the great Michael Powell. Interestingly now, still some 50 plus years later, there are still people discovering the film for the first time and not being sure what they have just watched; much like many critics back in 1960 as it happens! While horror seekers quite often come away disappointed that they haven't seen a Jack the Ripper bloodshed movie. Apparently they see the words serial killer and expect gore and terror on tap.As fans of the film will attest, Peeping Tom isn't that sort of serial killer film, it's a fascinating piece of work. A cunningly crafted observation of a darkened mind, of voyeurism, loneliness and child abuse. From the opening strains of Easdale's skin itching piano the mood is set, then the brilliantly lurid colour scheme comes into play as troubled Mark Lewis (Boehm) hones in on a victim, a lady of the night about to be filmed in the throes of death. It's the start of Powell and Marks' ploy to make us complicit in Lewis' actions, and then the makers challenge us to sympathise with him as his back story is revealed and also as he struggles with his affections for Helen Stephens (Massey) in the present day.There is also a sly aside to the movie industry running through the picture, something which no doubt irked critics and film distributors back in 1960. There could maybe be an argument that the trauma and psychological thematics at work that underpin the plot are a little dated now? But what is still relevant is the film making &#x96; voyeurism angle as we today are constantly fed reality TV for entertainment purpose. The production is across the board grade A, the performances highly effective, with the unfairly maligned Boehm perfect as Lewis, the actor even providing shadings of Peter Lorre at times. Heller's bold colour photography is disgustingly atmospheric, Easdale's music a stalking menace and the sound department really come up trumps. Perfect.Then of course there is Powell himself, deeply hurt by the savaging he received when Tom was released, it's nice to note that before he passed away in 1990 he would see the film become a highly regarded piece of film making. It and he deserves praise, his direction is conceptually daring, his framing of Lewis methodical, and of course his camera is our eyes and ears, uncomfortably so.

It was hated with the passion by both critics and the audiences alike. It was pulled out of the theaters only after one week. Why? It is a masterpiece. It is breathtaking combination of voyeurism, eroticism, and horror. The main character is a serial killer who films his victims as he literally kills them with his camera achieving the level of genuine fear and horror that no other filmmaker would be able to achieve. We watch the women as they die being filmed for a movie and paying with their lives for its grim realism. Maybe, that was the reason for hatred? Peeping Tom is provocative and very unsettling. The serial killer, a young, shy, attractive and sympathetic man is a victim himself. He was raised by a scientist father who filmed him under intensely emotional conditions studying how the fear affects the children. Powell himself played the father and his young son played young Mark Lewis. I think it also added to the initial shock when the movie was released. Peeping Tom is also the movie about making movies. Mark works as a camera assistant for a film director and dreams about becoming a famous director one day. He is ready to pay an ultimate price for finishing his own documentary.Peeping Tom has been called a Very British Psycho and it was released two months before Hitchcock's film. The similarities are plenty but Powell's film is much darker and it does not have a psychiatrist in the end to explain Mark Lewis. Ironically, Peeping Tom's unavailability for many viewers for many years has preserved its power and impact better than the initial universal approval and praise would ever have done. I can understand the controversy of the subject but how could the sheer brilliance of film-making - the choice of music, the work of camera, the acting, the dark humor (the guy who looked like Hitchcock was darkly-hilarious) not have been noticed is beyond me.

I was really looking forward to seeing it, but I have to say that I was a little disappointed. Compared to Black Narcissus and The Red Shoes - both amazing films - Peeping Tom seemed a big step down. I was left with the impression that the critics were probably right, in that it was not a very good movie. Had it been better paced and better written, it might have made a much better impression on critics at the time, but as it is, it just sort of came across as a rather dull and poorly done version of the sort of thing that British television specialized in at the time (The Saint, The Avengers, Thriller, etc.), only more lurid. Carl Boehm was miscast, and the scene with Moira Shearer seemed to go on for far too long, and its only purpose seemed to be to show off her dancing. I would have preferred having her play a larger role. The detective element of the film was weak at best. The notion of Mark Lewis moonlighting as a porn photographer was interesting, and I would have liked to have seen that explored a little more. It just seemed like the film was made up of a whole bunch of loose ends that were never tied up. The brightest spot was the casting of Anna Massey as Lewis' girlfriend. She brought an honesty to the role, and her plain looks brought a certain beauty to the part that a more traditionally glamorous actress might have spoiled.Overall, not a bad movie but not a great one either, and Michael Powell didn't deserve to have his career ruined over it.

The main character of the film seemed to be photography itself, and the psychology of the antihero and his victims faded into insignificance in the fragmented view of the film that I had.Not only did cameras abound in the film, and were at once the means of vision - both in the sense of the making of film itself and also in the sense of being the main agency in allowing the protagonist to fulfil his aims - they are perhaps also cyphers for seeing and for viewpoint and for perspective and outlook, drawing the viewer into a world of questions on these subjects.What fascinated me most about the film though was the colour. This was frustrated by my only having my colour-blind friend to discuss it with, and while he does see quite a lot of colours he doesn't see them all and this undermines his interest in colour generally.This film was made long after 2-colour films were obsolete, yet the film is shot to look like 2-colour Technicolor. IMDb credits it as using Eastmancolor 35mm film, so the colour set-ups in the film are self-consciously reproducing an earlier era of film by controlled use of hair colourings, set design, light gels and costume. The palette of the film is fascinating and beautiful, revisiting the stylised colour gamut which had decades earlier - after it's initial impact - come to leave film audiences unsatisfied by its unrealism. By the time this film was shot audiences were accustomed to rich full-spectrum photography and the colouring of the film subverts that, while highlighting the beauty of the older films at their best with, perhaps, an added glow that memory and nostalgia and better technology can create.Having missed most of the plot of the film, I have no idea if this colour lushness is purely a sensual layer of technical beauty this film is imbued with or whether it has an important interaction with the film's philosophical or psychological elements - but it sure was good to look at.

It is slow paced and I think that a million copies have been made already of this movie. I didn't expect to enjoy it first.Carl boehm is especially good in the main role, Mark. This could be the basic archetype of that nerdy serial killer role which has been done to death now. So I guess I have to blame this movie for that stereotype. His quiet measured performance is surprising considering the times and this movie might have signalled the new era of cinema along with Psycho. The similarities are unmistakable. Both movies have lead characters who give very understated performances and they unravel only in the final moments. No overtly melodramatic performances here, just pure realism. Even the music is minimalist and most suspenseful scenes don't have any music at all.I loved the characters here especially the mother character. The way she sensed the slightest bit of danger and problems. For example, there is a scene where she flinches when Mark doesn't close the door. The scene with her and Mark in the house is especially impressive. The buildup of tension is amazing in that scene and even in the scene with Vivian's death. The ending is also stylishly done, with no over the top theatrics and pretty much the only ending that could be possible in that situation. Another aspect that I liked was the use of comedy (but don't worry it is not prominent). There are a few lines that are quite funny especially the scene in the beginning with the old man. The comedic touches are underrated in this movie. Even otherwise, the dialogue is of high quality especially Mark's lines when he speaks about his past and about his feelings with Helen. And especially when he talks about his motivations.It seems the censorship in this case actually works in its favour. Because it makes it much more creepy when you can't see the bodies or the rough way in which the killing is done. It is only implied and that makes it creepier. But the movie is not just about its horrific elements but also its sad elements. It is essentially a doomed love story, an impossible love story which can never end well. Maybe it is the sympathetic portrayal that caused the negative reaction to the movie. I loved it. 8/10 "},{"Title":"Driven to fears","Date":"15 November 2008","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Thriller","Review":" Peeping Tom is about a young man who was driven to insanity (and ultimately, suicide) by his sadistic father through psychological experiments. If you think such experiments are fictional, think again. A few days ago I read in a brand-new psychology textbook about a boy who had been conditioned to fear furry objects by shocking him acoustically (through a siren or loud bell) every time he touched a furry object such as a teddy bear. The experimenters were delighted when he showed fear of any furry object even in the absence of the sound. He had been successfully conditioned. The experimenters were indignant when the boy's custodian (the boy was apparently an orphan) removed him from the experiment (presumably after realising what the experiment consisted of), which barred them from deprogramming the boy.Peeping Tom is a bold and memorable movie, an intelligent shocker that was way ahead of its time. Unfortunately I felt that the opening scene gave away too much, which killed much of the suspense. Instead of a whodunnit, the movie offers more of a psychological analysis. What makes the movie truly creepy is how we get to know and like the psychopath. In the end we see him with a fascination that equals the way he views his victims.The actor of the lead psychopath Mark Lewis, Carl Boehm, is actually the Austrian Karlheinz B√∂hm. It's no mean feat of his to deliver his lines without a noticeable accent. This role was a radical break in B√∂hm's career, which had brought him to great fame and popularity in German-speaking countries as the handsome young emperor Franz alongside Romy Schneider in a series of movies about Bavaro-Austrian empress Sisi. Incidentally, Karlheinz B√∂hm is probably one of the nicest people around. After his movie career he devoted his life to fighting poverty and starvation in Africa, for which he was awarded honorary citizenship in Ethiopia.I've read that Peeping Tom crushed Michael Powell's career. Incredible. I hope all those critics are now in a place where they have to see Fiddler On The Roof all day.

Like many Hitchcock films, we see the inner working and reasoning of a serial killer in such a way as to understand his motivations, and Carl Boehm gives an excellent and subtle personal portrayal of a soul tormented by his own desires.On the surface it is a creepy psychological drama - rather kitsch-y by now with the pin up girls. But when you have Moira Shearer giving possibly her best performance, lively and humorous, as one of the murder victims, you have something special, and something deeper.This film has a lot to say about the voyeurism and destruction that persists within the industry. About how the industry chews up young women to suit the various perversions of Directors and producers... the purveyors to the public; and how the sickness feeds on itself. Powell's brilliance was to include himself as the demon father in the home movie sequences of the child being psychologically abused that caused.It was ahead of it's time in anticipating how the pornography industry would infiltrate and become accepted within the mainstream media. (Think of the glossy gore movies being produced today by major studios.) It was also ahead of it's time in how documentary (think news reporting) is used to excuse uninvolvement. I can only film the action, I'm not responsible for getting involved and stopping the horror I'm filming.This was also an extremely strong indictment of the idea of casting non-actors to achieve reality. The rage of the new wave cinema of the time was to cast non-actors, and then put them in uncomfortable situations to try to evoke a real reaction from them. (Invariably what was - and still is - produced was fairly leaden performances of people who were uncomfortable being on film.) Powell's film uncannily makes the subtle point that a good actor can do a better job with half the effort. Of course all this enraged critics at the time. No one wants to be reminded they've been sold a bag of magic beans. More shocking then was that it is also an indictment of how psychology - in studying human emotions as a subject - also alienates people from each other as objects of study instead of feeling for them and relating to them. Brilliant, and still deeply relevant.

Between the cross-hairs of a 16mm camera, we see a lone prostitute petitioning the cameraman. Track into her apartment where she proceeds to undress and sit down on her bed. Suddenly, she screams as the camera closes in on her face, a mask of pure terror. What follows this lurid intro is the story of a reclusive focus-puller, Mark Lewis (Carl Boehm), who moonlights as a photographer of pornographic pictures and, occasionally, murders a stray model or two. Up until this point, he has remained almost entirely aloof from society, spending long hours in his apartment developing, editing, and screening his own proto-snuff films. But his next-door neighbor, Helen (Anna Massey) can't resist the urge to find out what he's working on...and what drives him to such obsessive lengths. If only she knew the psychological scars she was picking at... There are very few successful films that actually foreground the experience of making films as well as watching them. Michael Powell's 'Peeping Tom' fits this mold; when it was first released in 1960 (aptly the same year as 'Psycho'), the film was almost universally banned for its violent content, and it's likely that few of the spectators even grasped--much less enjoyed--its own brooding introspection into the medium. Today, many of the elements seem rather dated and baroque the stereotypical, two-dimensional film crew Mark encounters on a daily basis, the melodramatic heightening of emotion during key scenes, the plinky piano music that has since become cliche (Halloween). But Powell seems to be suggesting that such worn-out conventions actually mask the raw, primal experience of the cinephile's terror our fear of witnessing our own fear reflected back at us in the characters with whom we have identified. It is such an abrupt rupture that forces us to confront the mechanics of filmmaking--the way in which film can,  through its every elaborate set-up, situate us as perverse, complicit witnesses of violence and murder.

Coming out just before Psycho, it had a completely different reaction and was pulled from theaters. It hit too close to home for many people.But Powell has a champion in Martin Scorsese, who considered this film and Fellini's 8 1/2 all you needed to know about directing. Scorsese watched all of Powell's films and sought them out in special screenings.What was so upsetting about this film? Maybe because it made us too much a part of the action.

By today's standards (albeit with a few edits that may never be corrected) it could get away with not even a soft R, but back when it was released Peeping Tom caused such an uproar with the uptight British censors that it not only brought the film to a crashing halt in distribution, but tarnished the reputation of one of Britain's most revered filmmakers beyond repair, and he was only 54; it would only be once Scorsese and others championed his classics that he would finally feel at peace before his death. The greatest gift, however, is that Peeping Tom wasn't tossed into the ocean like half of Magnificent Ambersons or put in the incinerator like most of Strohem's Greed, and that today's audience's can judge the film on its own terms. And on the terms it's a a creepy, atmospheric masterpiece, a work of skill technically that should not be too lightly looked on as being as strong as that of the Red Shoes, and probably was ahead of its time in pressing forward the subjective angle of a mad killer as being more than just that.What's superb about just watching Peeping Tom is seeing how Powell, as he did with Red Shoes and Tales of Hoffmann, makes a unique color palette. It may have just been the print on the Criterion DVD being faded, yet there's something to the look for the most part that has the feel of a pulp-fiction paperback book coming to life, in all its bold-faced subject matter and a dangerous character at the center. It's the story of Mark Lewis (Bohm, with a perfectly terrified and terrifying look of a man who can't stand his obsession but is driven by it), amateur photographer and focus puller at a motion picture studio. On the side he's been getting a little too crafty- he follows a prostitute and we see that he comes closer with his little 16mm camera, up in her face, and as she screams it cuts to the projection of her screaming and fading out. Did he kill her? This might be explained well enough when we finally see it, in all the finger-biting tension leading up to it as a stand-in on the movie set becomes his target how to get in the mood for this 'screen test' she asks? The proper motivation, right on his camera stand it seems.This might make for a slightly thin story, but in the pulp-fiction tradition there's also a romantic interest in the downstairs neighbor, a girl who just turned 21 and is interested in Mark's movies. She's intrigued, and disturbed, and rightfully so by footage of his father putting a lizard on his bed as a kid. But they start seeing each other- no photography though- and her mother, blind as can be, won't stand for it (this brings an immensely satisfying scene with touches of dark humor when she is in Mark's screening room unannounced and he nearly goes for the kill). There's a typical murder investigation, evidence mounting, so on and so forth, who will he kill next. This would only be slightly of interest if it weren't going somewhere or put into some heavy direction. Powell, taking off on Leo Marks's clever screenplay, makes tension into something that is relatable to Hitchcock but not at the same time; even Hitchcock never got this much into a subjective perception through the character. Right from the start we have to go along with this guy, as crazy as he is, but with little moments of sympathy that are striking, leading up to the wild, melodramatic climax where it verges into pure theater.There's also a subtext to the material that could be considered, for its time, a precursor to Blowup, that's posed daringly to the viewer. What is it about the movie image, or just capturing it, that moves from reality into a blend of it? Do we really see what we want to or is desire and Freudian sensibilities in the mix? Going back to Hithccock too is the whole deal with observing, seeing to the point where it's like nothing at all to the person doing the looking, where curiosity pushes into obsession. There's a great scene where Mark and his date are about to go out but she convinces him to leave his most precious camera behind. He does, and as soon as they walk out he sees a couple making out in the shadows by a tree. He's frozen stiff- can he take seeing things without the medium? Can any of us? Compelling, bitingly funny, and with an edge that sticks through Powell's fine vision.

Hitchcock filled his story with intentional humor so that it became not just a horror film but a black comedy as well with psychological overtones. PEEPING TOM plays it straight all the way through, effectively showing how a tormented childhood turned an innocent boy into a killer who wants to see the fear on his victim's faces.I watched it with interest but with a certain detachment, never becoming completely involved in the story. For one thing, some of the incidents don't ring true at all. The girl who tries to befriend the anti-hero (Anna Massey) seems clueless to the fact that his stuttering creepiness might be masking a very troubled individual. Her casual attitude toward him becomes unconvincing after he continues to exhibit his odd behavior in various social situations. With credibility lost, the picture is merely an exercise in watching someone self-destruct because of his tormented past.The acting leaves something to be desired. Carl Boehm with his slight German accent tends to overact when more subtle restraint would have made his role more credible. A more attractive female co-star would have helped (someone like Hitch used in PSYCHO--Janet Leigh), but Anna Massey is a drab, chinless looking little creature with her sad eyes and pursed lips. And the woman who might have made a more attractive co-star, Moira Shearer, is given short shrift with an underwritten role and a brief appearance as a wannabe dancer/actress, although she gets star billing.Still, as a study of a troubled man, PEEPING TOM does have its compensations--excellent color photography and interesting use of a jazz music background.

The film is mostly a pity fest tortured, misunderstood artist who's totally possessed by his need to express himself through, in this case, a most deadly artform of capturing death on film by killing the women (and only women) he meets. As usual in these kind of tortured artist stories, there's a woman who falls for Mark and the thing sorta becomes a tragic love story (thank god Alfred Hitchcock didn't write a love interest for Norman Bates in PSYCHO). The idea of Helen (wonderfully played by underrated Anna Masey) falling for Mark is ridiculous and totally forced. The clunky premise isn't helped much by the unconvincing psychology behind the killer's motivations his father tortured him when he was a kid and yet Mark, as an adult, only kills women. Okay. Things only got less subtle, with Helen's mother being a blind woman who's all seeing and wise which SCREAMED to me that the film was more of a not-so-subtle symbolic exercise from Michael Powell about himself and his career as a filmmaker than anything else. The fact that Michael Powell himself played the domineering father in the black and white home movies and that the kid who plays young Mark was Michael Powell's real son and the fact the home movies were shot where Powell grew up as a kid only reinforced the whole self-indulgent aspect of the movie me, me, me! This obvious self-indulgence in the story and direction killed ALL attempts at horror.But if you watch PEEPING TOM as a tribute to Michael Powell's career, made by Michael Powell himself, well, the movie is suddenly fitting and brilliant. Fitting as a tribute because PEEPING TOM  suddenly became Powell's last major movie after the uproar it created when it was released. PEEPING TOM, or the controversy surrounding the movie, basically killed Powell's career as a serious filmmaker. The elaborate behind-the-scenes moments or the scenes with Moira Shearer (who worked with Powell in THE RED SHOES) dancing around the studios say more about the famed filmmaker than the film's tortured character. Watch PEEPING TOM as some sort of elaborate post-modern tribute to the director. Don't watch it as a horror movie.

This is because it is fundamentally a very modern film but one made without modern skills.  A serial killer movie made when these were (mercifully) less fashionable than now, it deals with its subject with less gore, and more sensitivity, than most of its modern counterparts.  The use of hand-held camera shots (albeit with explicit narrative justification) is similarly modern, while the central character's voyeurism brings to mind Soderbergh's debut, 'sex, lies and videotape'.  But the sets are poor, the music ugly, the killer's motivation unconvincing (though in this respect, few modern counterparts do better); while the acting is completely wooden, especially from Anna Massey as the young woman attracted (apropos of nothing) to the weird guy living upstairs.  The portrait of the wider social fabric also seems clumsy and quite unrecognisable to a contemporary eye, although from this juncture, it's hard to tell to whether to conclude that the world has changed, or merely our skill in portraying it.'Peeping Tom' is an ambitious film - a detective story, a love story, a story of trauma and its affect upon character, a horror story and even for a while, a satire of the movie business itself.  Yet the absence of realism in the performances is striking - though probably no worse than most cinema of its time (even in  Welles' great 'Touch of Evil', shot a year before, only the director appears to really act).  What's amazing is how quickly movies were to change hereafter.   It's hard to believe that only a decade should separate this work from the still fresh-cinema of the early 1970s.

Peeping Tom is an important film for students of cinema as well as psychology as it examines in detail the relationship fear has in cinema. This relationship is so mutually common that both of them are used abundantly by the film's leading man Mark Lewis. For many viewers, home theater is a modern invention which brings viewers closer to films but for a peeping tom like Mark Lewis it had a different personal connotation as he had his own version of home theater at home which enabled him to seek pleasure by watching fear. It is cinema especially its technical side which helps Mark Lewis to create fear in the minds of his victims. Peeping Tom was made in 1960s, a time of revolutionary change all over the world.

As a result, the director was hailed as a genius of the macabre and went on to become one of the true icons of cinema.That same year, celebrated British director Michael Powell made Peeping Tom, a provocative look at an individual every bit as disturbed as Hitchcock's Norman Bates; in contrast to Psycho, the film was vilified by critics who were disgusted by what they saw and Powell's once illustrious career was left in tatters.Both films already demanded a lot from the audience simply by expecting a degree of sympathy towards characters who were as much victim as they were monster, but perhaps Peeping Tom asked a little too much of the average movie-goer of the day it would be a few more years before Britain would get into full on swinging sixties mode, and the idea of immorality as commonplace, with sex and sleaze to be found on every corner, even under a news-agent's counter in the presence of innocent schoolchildren, was a probably a bitter pill to swallow; the film also forced home the uncomfortable truth that, by watching, the viewer was every bit as guilty of voyeuristic tendencies as its crazed killer (it was bad enough to have to try and understand the antagonist, let alone identify with him).In these far more enlightened and accepting times, Peeping Tom has been recognised as the groundbreaking, visionary piece of cinema that it was and still is&#x97;a little too late for Michael Powell perhaps, but not too late for us.

A movie once repudiated as a filthy, trash and smutty experience trailed through images that distort your imagination, the movie is now looked at as something more. But how is it that today, even though it has sufficient cult status, is this movie overlooked by some of the fans of cinema? Heck, even some Horror Fans (as both fans of these things) have ignorantly, like myself, just been presented with this film.However, I finally got to see it this week to really gather up my thoughts on it. The beginning shot reminded me of the Warren Beatty movie Dick Tracy (1990) where everything is colourful, sensational and everything is filled with fluorescent lighting representing a very riveting and visually stunning opening to present us with the expectancy of our character, Mark Lewis played by Carl Boem, who just unexpectedly killed a prostitute on a film set; however, this killer is very unique in it that his weapon of choice happens to be the leg of camera. The movie uses fear as a real means of establishing the condition internally and externally; it's a thrilling, yet dull and simple idea, yet what Powell does with it is manifest it in ways that actually causes fear to Mark Lewis; he's a meek, easily shy and very rigid character, using his camera as a means of getting into his mind and flamboyance as a human; it's his comfort zone that really gives him his place with it.Helen (Played by Anna Massey) is really the onlooker and the individual capable of breaking his place outside normality; she does this in subtle ways; for example, she knows of his obsession being really overbearing to him, and she always tries to keep him on track; dating him and also trying to understand his traits. She and the Audience are witnessing incomprehensible images of him as a child, in his secret vault where he develops his films, where we see incidentally Powell's kid being used as a subject towards threat, his antics recorded for means of examining the human animal and timid ways of making him think; appropriately and fascinatingly, Powell is in the film, as if to create a forth wall element and also to show that we really are voyeurs looking through a microscope at the stripped images.Mark is an aspiring film maker, who is making a documentary that is evidently about himself and his obsessive compulsion with the death of women, as they slowly meet their demise within split seconds. But then we're presented with the notion that this guy is an innocuous character, who in his heart can create an escapist paradise Helen, who almost seems oblivious to him as a human being; even his Mum (which I found off) knows that he's something more even with her blindness; it's a metaphor for do you think we're blind? But it's still weird to put in the film. Mark is a perfectionist with the medium and craftsmanship and he and his friend always discuss things to do with cinema veirtie and general pop cult discussions, as they their selves learn the trade. Mark is a soft pornographer as well, and this gives us the genesis to his love with the camera and his deadly fixation with... you know.Powell's experience is really interesting and it is also a statement about the man himself and to the art of film making Personally I think it says that committing yourself to film is part of a whole growing impulse, an obsession and perhaps even a revelation about you as a human being (Mark does have an inkling to his own behaviour), but it also gives you the feeling that with everything at hand, you're truly the stager of something that spellbinds people; not only to the extent of spellbinding audiences but to the point where he excessively nauseates them, and only he can watch them at his own well. In the end of the movie, he knows that his movies incarnate him, and there will be a further prolonged existence of him that may endure... To Mark, the world he creates is fantasy and the movie is basically reality; however, he does say wholeheartedly that he killed them but he trembles when trying to accept it. Likewise with Powell's vision of the dangerous genre that failed and infiltrated into the mind of young film makers a the time, he lives on incarnate through this medium of film that he so wonderfully worked in. Therefore I can't recommend this movie enough.I was thinking about a proposed 7, but after carefully thinking, I do believe that a 10 is fairly placed for this film; everyone should watch it even if not a big film fan; it's the movie thats ridiculous controversy has gave it a pedestal to sit on for 5 Decades.

Yet, so controversial was it, this film wrecked Powell's career.In fact, in one scene, a young girl familiarly enters a corner store to buy some candy -- happily and innocently oblivious to the soft-core girlie and lingerie magazines prominently displayed among the newspapers, soft drinks and cigarettes.WE know, though the girl doesn't and couldn't care less, that these scantily clad women are photographed in a shabby room upstairs by a shy psychopath who works at a movie studio as a focus puller by day, and moonlights at night as a mentally tortured stalker and murderer of women, documenting their last moments of fear and death with his Bell & Howell and deadly tripod.That corner drug store scene juxtaposes a dirty old man negotiating with the proprietor for under-the-counter porn; the disturbed psychopathic killer waiting in the store to go upstairs and murder a half-naked soft-core model; and their interruption by an innocent young girl buying candy. The scene as a whole is unbelievably perverse and tense.But LOOK at it. As actually staged and shot by Michael Powell, the actress playing the girl is exposed to NOTHING that we think she is while she's in the store. The actress sees no dirty pictures anywhere because there are just innocent pin-ups of the day on the set. They're dirty in our mind's eye and our overall impression of the scene because of Powell's brilliant montage and cutting. So it's incredibly disturbing and wrong, when in the actual shooting it was quite innocent and harmless.Same with the infamous black-and-white shots of the killer as a boy being purposefully terrified and filmed by his sadistic scientist / psychologist father for research. The boy was Michael Powell's own son.Shot by shot, frame by frame, there is NOTHING in the least disturbing about these sequences. The boy's in bed asleep (fairly obviously an amateur actor pretending). A light shines on him. He wakes up when his offscreen father drops a salamander on his bed. There's a CU shot of the salamander on the blanket, crawling toward the camera (us) that would have been impossible for the father to get in the context of the scene. It's complete artifice. Then shots of the boy crying and wiping his eyes (again, unconvincingly, per an amateur actor performing to Daddy's instructions).But the way these quick snippets are cut together doesn't give us time to consciously realize this is an amateur actor who isn't really crying (no tears) or that the CU salamander shot would have been impossible. The montage makes the sequence appear absolutely horrifying and cruel and almost unwatchable.More than meets the eye.Powell's technique of showing us nothing in Peeping Tom, but evoking revulsion and horror and pity and fear by making us think we're seeing everything, is to me superior even to Hitchcock's Psycho. Not that Powell was a better director. But he sustains the art of cinema montage, in Peeping Tom, from opening sequence to the last stunning suicide of the lead character, better and more consistently than Hitchcock (with his notorious penchant for humorous breaks and sequences to relieve audience tension) ever did.Peeping Tom never lets up. Does it achieve the spectacular electrifying tensions of Hitchcockian montage sequences in North by Northwest or Psycho or Notorious? No.Powell's accomplishment in Peeping Tom is far subtler and ultimately more disturbing because it's sustained from first voyeuristic montage sequence (we watch the killer stalk and kill a hooker through his camera's viewfinder) to the last grueling and brilliantly unnerving climax.That climax is like a symphony a mad orgy of self-destruction accompanied by the cries of terrified children on multi-track tapes, the killer / lead character rushing across his darkened studio to ram his throat onto his razor-sharp extended tripod-blade, triggering an array of pre-planned rapid-fire flashes to photograph his own jaw-dropping demise and staring finally at his own frightened face in the circular mirror around the camera's lens -- I'm frightened! I'm GLAD I'm frightened! -- Then calm, as he collapses to the floor, dying, hearing Daddy's voice Don't be a silly boy. Bravura! The actors, thanks to Michael Powell's direction, are uniformly brilliant and underplay everything with total believability and sympathy. Everything (on purpose) looks cheap and oversaturated and tawdry, like a Piccadilly carnival or Madame Tussaud's Chamber of Horrors.Peeping Tom still has the power to disturb, thanks to Powell's mastery of montage.Because, frame for frame, in reality, it's visually as innocent as Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm. People look scared in close-ups, a bewildered salamander inspects the lens, the sound track of unseen crying children (because of the montage and context) is unsettling, and the minimalist script and superb acting make the whole enterprise feel almost like a subversively-filmed documentary (like the one the killer is shooting).But in the end, all the twisted perversity takes place in our minds. More shockingly, really, than even Hitchcock, (this film effectively ended Powell's career, so successfully did he achieve what he set out to do), Michael Powell makes us the ultimate voyeurs, ultimate psychopaths, and manipulates our emotions through the transporting power of cinema's supreme technique, of all the arts montage.

It certainly stands next to any of classic psychological thriller whether it's Polanski or Master Hitchcock's best films, including 'Psycho' which was released in the same year. The great thing about the film is Powell's treatment; its almost told and shot from the point of view of voyeur named Mark who's suffering from neurological disorder. Keeping Mike always focused as peeping Tom from various spaces, he's compulsive voyeur who's watching and filming everything about his subjects even after things were over. You can say that camera is his alter-ego and also an Achilles heel why cops sniff him. The dark past experience of his life was also told through the screening moments on projector where we witness his sadistic biologist father throwing lights or dropping lizards on his child's bed to experiment reactions of the nervous system to the fear in young child. The film also bears some interesting characters like the blind women whose sixth sense is more powerful than normal ones. There're some lighter moments too where an old man hesitates to ask for erotic magazines; perhaps another social voyeur who's seeking pleasure! It was shot almost in classic vibrant colors by Otto Heller keeping the thrilling atmosphere and tone throughout. The other film I would like to compare is Antonioni's d√©j√† vu classic 'Blow Up'. Director Sam Mandes paid homage to Powell's this masterpiece in his 'Road to Perdition' where Jude Law's psychopathic character is derived from Mike.Need I write 'Must Watch'!

It's a little depressing to think that for the current generation, it's movies like SCREAM or URBAN LEGENDS or even FINAL DESTINATION that qualify as classics.If you want to really get a gander at what real classic old-school horror looks like, take a break from the Eighties or even the Seventies stuff, open up your mind and go back even farther. That's where you'll find PEEPING TOM waiting for you.PEEPING TOM is the only horror entry ever produced by the once-acclaimed British producer Michael Powell. Powell, together with his producing partner Emeric Pressburger, was responsible for some of the most remarkable and highly regarded artistic dramas ever made, the most famous of these being THE RED SHOES, which starred the beyond-gorgeous Moira Shearer, and inspired God-only-knows-how-many little girls to become prima ballerinas when they grew up. Let's just say that when Powell did something, he never went about it half-assed. It was all the way, or no way, and when he read the script by Leo Marks for what eventually became his most personal movie yet...and his undoing, he attacked it with the same dedication and energy that he had when making THE RED SHOES. Here was the problem PSYCHO, the movie by his contemporary Alfred Hitchcock, came out only months after TOM, and met with critical acclaim, while Powell's once sterling career lay in ruins. The public, being familiar with Hitch and the kind of films he made, were thoroughly shocked but not surprised that he produced a work as extreme for the time as PSYCHO was. On the other hand, having Powell come out with PEEPING TOM at that period, would be kind of like having Walt Disney produce THE EXORCIST, but at the beginning of the Sixties, not the Seventies.One glance at the plot line can explain why, and also prove that Powell was way ahead of his time with this shocker. Carl Boehm plays Mark Lewis, a good-looking, quiet, shy young man who lives alone in his flat with his equipment and his darkroom. He's a photographer by trade, but just taking still pictures or even movies is not his real passion in life. His real life's passion...is death. He loves to photograph beautiful women, but with a difference...attached to the tripod of his camera is a sharpened stake that he uses to capture the death throes of the women he photographs - and murders simultaneously.It's hard not to be horrified by his actions, but strangely enough, it's hard not to root for him, too. It seems that his father (played by director Powell) was obsessed with the nature of fear and its effect on the human psyche, and guess who his favorite guinea pig was in his experiments? You guessed it right MARK. So no wonder Mark is so screwed up!But not too screwed up to get involved with an independent-minded neighbor named Helen Stephens (Anna Massey), who is taken with Mark, even after she learns the horrifying secret of his upbringing, and becomes closer to him as the more practical side of her common sense tells her to run like hell from this guy, if she won't listen to the ominous warnings of her demanding invalid mom, (Maxine Audley.)Less an out-and-out gory horror thriller than a disturbing psychological exercise, PEEPING TOM not only studies fear, but also voyeurism and duplicity. By witnessing his acts of torture and murder both from outside and through the eye of the camera, the audience becomes just as guilty as Mark does of watching these women die...and getting off on the rush of it. The Freudian undertones of associating sex and death as similar must've been something that people at that time (ESPECIALLY in uptight England) weren't ready for, and most certainly not from the man who made THE RED SHOES!PEEPING TOM was outright banned in many places, and cut to nonsensical ribbons in others, where it was shown in criminally censored versions. Powell was never again able to raise the kind of money or interest in anything else he wanted to produce. Financial backers considered his name and influence as box office poison, forever tainted by his one notorious horror opus.It was only decades later, when the movie was restored to its original state and shown at film festivals, that its status as an early masterpiece was realized and Powell was hailed as a visionary filmmaker.Subtle and sinister and definitely tragic, this is what the definition of a TRUE horror classic is, and you owe it to yourself as a buff of the genre to see it at least once. You might regret the nightmares you may have from seeing it, but not having seen the film itself.

Michael Powell directed from a story and screenplay by Leo Marks. Marks also wrote the story behind Cloudburst (1951), which is about an ordinary man driven to murder out of revenge. And he co-wrote another psychological screenplay, Twisted Nerve.Peeping Tom features a top-notch performance from Karl Boehm as the troubled protagonist. He is driven and he knows it. He's not psychotic but twisted, having been made that way by his father who was a biologist interested in fear. His sadistic father is shown in old film and was played by Powell.Boehm's murders torture him. Anna Massey and her mother, Maxine Audley, live in the house owned by Boehm, the same house where he grew up. Massey is attracted to Boehm and unknowingly is trying to draw him back to normality. Her blind mother is more suspicious. Rather than turn this into an ordinary thriller, although it does have some suspense, Peeping Tom provides much exposition of Boehm, showing us what he sees through his camera, showing us the details of his murders, and having us watch his films after he has made them and as he watches them. He's the focus of the film, as the title suggests, and not any good guys or detectives, apart from Massey who likes him. Boehm's relationship with Massey is explored in quite a lot of realistic detail too, as part of the explication of Boehm's character.Film noir marks a broad movement of movies into more sophisticated and deeper themes and areas of exploration than what came before, as well as a change in focus and emphasis on more subterranean characters and realistic psychologies. We certainly can find prior movies that herald such depth and focus, but in some sense, film noir marks the maturation of movie stories and ways of telling them. It also marks the audience acceptance of this material.Peeping Tom belongs in the noir category and is usually placed there. Daring for its time, it brought grief to Powell. The film explicitly shows extreme evil in family life and what it leads to. Psychosis is not the only source of evil; Boehm is not at all psychotic. The film shows the extreme difficulty of someone who is afflicted by conditioning of emotions from overcoming it. Hope and love do not conquer all. There are forms of corruption that accrue through family life and they are resistant to change.All of this is shown without the presence of a character like a doctor who presents it to us or by other such non-cinematic means. There is no prologue here from a psychiatrist, corresponding to those introductions by prison wardens and district attorneys that begin some crime-noirs. Nothing like that is done here to soften what we see. We see much of it through the eyes of Boehm's character himself. He is the undoubted protagonist. It brings to mind Carradine playing Bluebeard. It brings to mind both treatments of M.

Mark is a shy and reclusive man on the outside, but inside he is deeply disturbed as he goes around with his camera, murdering women with it, filming their gruesome deaths the whole time. Peeping Tom is a disturbingly brilliant film that is far ahead of its time as it combines voyeurism, eroticism, and horror to paint the portrait of a hauntingly fascinating protagonist in the context of a dense and complex character study.Peeping Tom is a film that is highly successful in being multiple things. In part it is a fascinating experimental film that does unique things with its characters, setting, and musical score to be a film unlike something we've seen before. I mention the haunting score because it is only comprised of different piano songs, each adding a bizarre uniqueness to the mood of the film. Peeping Tom also succeeds in being a thrilling suspense film. The intensity of the film and the tension that is built up in different scenes is stupendous and it is the kind of atmosphere that draws you in so deep within the film.Lastly, Peeping Tom is part character study, an element that stands out most between the other two concepts of the film. The main focus of this film is our main character, Mark, and his disturbing condition. It's a challenging film in that his true motivations and true feelings are never fully explained, and we can only piece them together as the film progresses. But his character is truly fascinating and more complex than something we would normally see from the 60's.However, Peeping Tom still has those elements of influence from the 60's culture in the way the characters speak, interact, and what is actually shown on camera. If you're expecting a gruesome film you will be disappointed as Peeping Tom does things very different than what we would expect. If it were made today it would obviously be a vastly different film, but for what it accomplishes as a movie made in 1960, it is incredibly good.

It is definitely not dated (as some people have claimed). For this, it is much too well crafted and too multilayered.It is almost perfect in every respect. It is very well shot in brilliant colours. Boehm as the mad serial killer is very convincing. Certainly, the movie's lack of gore and the handling of sexuality might make it appear dated. But there is still much more to it. First, there is the scene when Lewis shows his child memories to Vivian, as recorded by his father for his studies. This scene builds a very intense atmosphere of terror and madness, and its subject, parental violence against children and its effects on them, is as actual as ever. Second, the final scene when Lewis explains in detail his perverse technique of filming his victims by reflecting their own image to them is again one of the most memorable scenes I have seen, especially when we watch Vivian's distorted image in the mirror. By the way, the idea of making the victims watch their own death has been copied in the more recent Strange Days. Third, the movie shows a differentiated picture of the serial killer. In this respect, it is much more advanced than some recent (gory) serial killer movies. Once, Lewis is freed from his camera (on his first date with Vivian), he becomes a charming and normal boy. Fourth, the murders are depicted in such a way that gore simply isn't necessary. In this respect, the work of Powell is most reminiscent of Hitchcock. For example, when Lewis kills his second victim, the preparations for the murder are presented in so much detail that the audience starts longing for the act of killing. In this way, Powell not only transfers some of Lewis's guilt to the spectator (probably one of the reasons for the critics' reactions) but the killing itself just becomes the moment of relief and no gore is needed to create emotions. At another occasion, Powell varies the technique when Lewis meets Vivians's mother. This time no killing occurs (and not for the reason of some lucky intervention). Just one more evidence of how well crafted that movie is. Last but not least, the movie is not only concerned with the serial killer motif but also with voyeurism in general and in connection with cinema itself. After all, Lewis not only strives to capture the expression of fear on film, but his project is a complete documentary about the killing he wants to be a director. In a cynic way, this approach to cinema is  confirmed by the experience on the set of the movie on which Lewis works as the focus puller the main actress cannot produce an accurate fainting unless she discovers the body. Moreover, Powell's direction invites the spectator on various occasions to become the voyeur himself. The only thing which annoyed me in Peeping Tom where the pathetic role of Vivian's mother and the equally pathetic suicide of Lewis at the end.Peeping Tom is a highly recommended movie which by its intricate script and great production values contains enough material to enjoy on repeated viewings.

But it is the concept, not the film itself that is what is scary.Michael Powell made a beautifully-shot film about a camera following a camera, and he was more or less drummed out of the world of film for his troubles. The film was hated by censors and critics, reviews said it should be flushed down the toilet and it went underground to the black market. Of all people, it seems that it was Martin Scorsese who brought the film back to life by screening it in New York many years later.Now considered a classic and the British Psycho (which is odd considering Hitchcock himself was British), it truly is a must-see. This is a psychological thriller told from the point of view of the killer, which puts us in the awkward position of both witnessing the murders (which is horrific) and also being able to sympathize to some degree with the killer himself. We see his childhood and how he became the man he is.I am a bit confused on the peeping tom aspect of the film, as it is a relatively minor part of his character. His illness is not voyeurism so much as it is a desire to film his murders... not sure what that is, but probably not voyeurism.

Peeping Tom is an art film about the human condition. It has drama and suspense, but it's about depth vs. superficiality, and a disturbed, fearful character trying to film everything and slowly learns in symbolic and sometimes ironic ways that there are enormous things in life that cannot be filmed. His journey is driven by obsessive voyeurism which drives him to violence.Carl Bo√´hm creates a very intriguing presence, an overly refined, sympathetic but immensely disturbed person. Anna Massey is quite interesting as something of a hasty, temperamental foil to Bo√´hm. This is my first Michael Powell film, and I like his culturally and stylistically conscious direction.Peeping Tom seems to veer off into some standard plot mechanics that tie the ending in a nice little bow for us, meaning that everything's perfectly clear because it's perfectly ended. It leaves us nothing ambiguous to ponder. It's not as dark as it could've been, but perhaps that's apart of its charm.

It was slated by the critics mainly because of its controversial story and way of storytelling. In many ways Peeping Tom was a movie that was ahead of its time and certainly an unique and one of kind for its time. That, at the same time, was the reason for the downfall of director Michael Powell. Now more than 40 years later, we look at this movie differently. It's hard to imaging these days that this movie once was regarded controversial. It certainly is a dark and creepy movie with a macabre undertone but those are things which are regarded as positive things present day. When one looks at this movie now, he or she has to come to the conclusion that Peeping Tom is a magnificent constructed movie, with a great story and a great fleshed out main character/psychopath/serial killer, who has been given an humane face and personality in the movie. He might not be as 'chilling' as Norman Bates but he is memorable and realistic nevertheless. Peeping Tom certainly is one of the best thrillers ever made.The concept of the movie is just great and even better executed. The movie has a perfect atmosphere and the tension is in some of the scene's build up extremely well. There are some unforgettable early 'thriller elements'. One of the few things which indicates how Peeping Tom was a movie ahead of its time. The movie feels realistic and it takes its time to tell the story and to build up the right mood. The ending of the movie is especially memorable and works very powerful.Another reason why this movie works extremely well as a thriller is because of the main character, who is portrayed very humane and one can easily understand his character and what drives him to his actions. It's a character we understand and perhaps even feel and sympathize for.Sure the movie does have its weaker points, such as the acting that is just below average at times to be perfectly honest. Also some of the plot elements of the movie are not developed well enough, such as the sequences with the investigations and the detectives. They could had done some more with this and it feels a bit unsatisfying and like a missed opportunity. Tiny things like this prevent me from rating this movie a perfect 10 out of 10.All in all this is a brilliant thriller that was in many ways ahead of its time and is quite honestly one of the best constructed thrillers I have ever seen. The movie shows a similar style to that of some early Alfred Hitchcock movies and Brian De Palma thrillers. So far this is the first and only Michael Powell movie I have seen but judging but this movie and its style, I already know that I will become a big fan of him and his other movies. For fans of the thriller genre this is an important movie and an absolute must see! Also when you're a fan of Hitchcock's and De Palma's work this is a movie for you to see.9/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Not really a masterpiece","Date":"26 September 2005","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Thriller","Review":" Yes, Pepping Tom has a fascinating plot and yes, some of the images are haunting. Anna Massey is very, very good in her part as a kind and intelligent young woman who likes the extremely-flawed hero. And certainly the movie is nowhere near as bad as the British critics made it out to be. But...Carl Boehm looks, but doesn't act, the part. As little as he speaks, his strong German accent is still apparent, and mystifying in a character who has supposedly been born of British parents and spent the whole of his life in London. This wouldn't matter so much if Boehm were a better actor, if he inhabited the role and made Mark Lewis a real person. (Veteran Miles Malleson puts more oomph into his bit part as a dirty old man, and he's only on the screen for about three minutes). The inclusion of Moira Shearer was, surely, just a favor between old friends--she is too old, too glamorous, too star-like for her very small part. What was the significance of the disfigured woman earlier in the movie? It's a fascinating minute or so, but the idea of how Mark sees imperfection is not picked up again. (If he's that fascinated, surely the heroine's mother, with her ruined eyes, would be more interesting to him?). Better casting and, I think, more money overall would have achieved a better movie--a real masterpiece, where this movie is just the germ of one.

I recorded a copy again recently (when it was broadcast at something like 3.00a.m. and introduced ominously in the voice-over as 'a 1960s horror movie'), and regret to say that my impressions of it have not improved at all despite the intervening years and my continued reverence for the products of Powell's career as a whole.It is clear that Powell thought he was trying to mix making a 'serious' film, investigating the nature of fear, sexual psychology and the role of cinema/film-making in awakening and developing these qualities in film audiences, with a 'popular' 'hunt the madman'-type detective story. In my view, though, he fails in BOTH endeavours. Both of the lead characters, played by Carl Boehm and Anna Massey, are wholly unconvincing and come across as caricatures and totally 'artificial'. The plot is entirely predictable and would have left a mass audience yawning within half an hour, whilst, overall, I regret to have to say that I CAN see fully why such words as 'sordid', 'tacky' and 'seedy' were used by critics when the film was first screened. From the very opening scene, (virtually a replay of numerous portrayals of a 'woman of the streets' meeting her murderer - as in countless 'Jack the Ripper' films), through the scenes of Boehm taking the 'glamour shots' of half-clad girls, (covered in garish lip-stick), in the upstairs room of the seedy tobacconist's shop through to the interminable murder scene with Moira Shearer, (obviously just appearing 'for old time's sake' with the director of 'The Red Shoes'), the direction is flat and does indeed have a voyeuristic, stilted quality which is alienating and discomforting. Of course it may well be argued that this is precisely what Powell is intending and that the audience SHOULD feel squeamish and 'guilty' at being what the title of the film is telling us we really are. The problem is that the feeling one is left with is NOT, contrary to what Powell may have claimed or thought, that this is being done in an investigatory or explanatory manner which shows any respect for the audience at all, but rather that, (just as in the revealing scene where Powell plays a sadistic father making his son afraid in various ways and filming the reactions), Powell is not aiming to understand his audience but to shock them in a way which shows contempt and loathing for them, (and totally unlike Hitchcock, of course, who invariably, (if not always), remained acutely conscious of how his audience would view and respond to any scene he directed). Powell (and Pressburger), had always had more than a touch of 'looking down' on their audiences but by this stage of his career, I think Powell had lost any empathy with his audiences at all, (especially the broad mass of cinema goers), and was beginning to regard them as 'box office fodder'. Audiences, and critics, felt this very quickly and reciprocated the feelings, (by staying away from the movie in droves), virtually killing Powell's career stone-dead, (as with other highly talented directors who 'turned their backs' on the mere film-goer, such as Von Stroheim and Welles).Wind forward twenty years and the young Hollywwod 'Brat Pack' are aiming to rediscover mass popular film entertainment, (in the shape of Star Wars, Close Encounters, Jaws etc.), and 'discover' half of the team behind A Matter of Life and Death, The Red Shoes, (above all), The Thief of Baghdad etc. etc. In the atmosphere of growing adulation, someone 'discovers' Peeping Tom and it, too, is proclaimed 'a masterpiece' as well. I beg to differ. To me it remains a cheap, garish 'shocker' which may have pretensions but whose failure was entirely predictable and justified and which does very little indeed for the overall estimation of one of the foremost talents which British cinema has ever produced.

What really matters is the aura that cloaks the male protagonist Mark. There is something fragile about him, something *vulnerable* that Vivian--the daughter of the couple renting the bottom floor of Mark's house--immediately notices and attempts to reach out to him. The viewer already knows that Mark is dangerous, but despite the psychopathy he has demonstrated in the precision of his killings, despite the perverseness of him filming it while it happens, and despite him developing said film so he can relive the moments over and over in the comfort of his makeshift studio, you pray that not only will Vivian be able to slip from his fingers unharmed as she unwittingly treads closer and closer to finding out his secret, but that her desire to know him better and to smooth out the kinks in his demeanor (the visible ones, anyway) makes for a surprisingly endearing couple.As the title of this review should tell you, it reminds me a lot of Francis Dolarhyde's relationship with Reba in Manhunter (much more pronounced and tragic in the Red Dragon version), in which the killer finds temporary solace in an unlikely 'Morality Pet', which, despite her attempts to help their secret killers, are in the end unable to do so, and to me they serve as reminders to the viewer that compassion and empathy are indeed imperative in the handling and treatment of the mentally ill or disturbed, but they alone cannot solve the psychosis (as Vivian's intuitive mother hinted to Mark near the end of the film).I would recommend watching this for those who are curious about the psychological horror genre but are intimidated by David Lynch and Stanley Kubrick's works.

The performance from the main lead is spot on, Carl Boehm gives a rather chilling and unsettling performance as the would be serial killer, which even sends chills down my spine and this is also the first ever proper slasher movie to feature the killer in POV shot.Released shortly before Hitchcock's Psycho the two movies bear many similarities not only in that both where directed by cinematic geniuses but that both where thought of as shocking and depraved in this very morbid masterpiece, Peeping Tom is lurid and lush in its use of colour which is both beautiful and brutal, something all the more evident in the DVD quality of this movie. Peeping Tom is not only a great piece of cinema but a highly original and influential piece of horror whose exploration into the psychology of a killer and our obsession with watching other peoples fear are as relevant today as they ever where.All in all Peeping Tom is a must see, if not just for it's quality filmaking but it's rather morbid outlook.

As we see later on, as a young boy, he was the subject of a lot of his Father's experiments, which ultimately lead to his insanity.I really liked this film because of its idea. I have yet to have seen a murder film in which the killer films his victims, so therefore, this must've been an idea that was not used that much during the time this film came out.However, although seemingly original, it was an idea that audiences and critics apparently did not like during the time of its release, since this film ultimately destroyed director Michael Powell's career. It really is a shame, because this film really is a masterpiece; I guess its controversial subject matter was too much for people to handle back in 1960.But, enough history, more critiquing. Like I said, I liked this movie, but it wasn't just the story itself that sold me on it; it was the actors, as well. Anna Massey is great as Helen, the lead female role, and Moira Shearer used some of her interesting dancing skills in a good way for a specific scene in her role as Vivian. But, all in all, it's Karlheinz Bohm that really sells it here. He is insane, but he's kind of like the tragic figure in a story. It is a really great performance.All in all, a great 60's horror film. I can kind of see why people would have been so disgusted back then, but I can't judge based on what people thought back then; I can only judge based on my own thoughts. And, in my own thoughts, I thought to myself, No wonder the scene where he almost kills the blind woman is on Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments. It really is a well-shot scene. Overall, it is a frightening, systematic view at the behaviour of a murderer, and a timeless masterpiece of horror movies. A 9/10 for me.

Maybe it's because showing greater appreciation for such films can be seen as an admission of something dark inside us. But these movies don't endorse the violence within; they merely make us see new perspectives and realize there's good and evil within every person.Coming out in 1960, just a bit before Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, Michael Powell's Peeping Tom is also about a mad serial killer. This one is named Mark, who films his women victims before stabbing them with a pointed piece of his camera. This movie has a style reminiscent of Hitchcock's photography, but I actually prefer it to Psycho. Without the stunt of killing off the main character half way through the movie, Peeping Tom gives the viewer more chance to know the killer- and feel more empathy for him. In that way, Peeping Tom is the more extreme movie. Mark was made a monster by years of childhood abuse. Take that away and he could be you or me. I particularly felt connected to him because he was a camera enthusiast, and I've taken a couple photo courses and have a camera myself. This movie also gives the killer a girlfriend, a good woman who doesn't know Mark's horrible secret.If what I've heard is true, this movie was bashed upon its release as hateful. The victims are all women (unless you count Mark as one of his own victims, since he kills himself). But I wouldn't say this movie hates women; I felt sorry for them when they died, and this movie also has two strong heroines, Mark's girlfriend and her blind mother. From Mark's filming to the old Briton nervously buying pornography, Peeping Tom is a naked look at our true society, a pessimistic vision of voyeurism and violence.

Championed for decades by the likes of Scorsese and Coppola, the film has slowly returned to mainstream attention, now being widely revisited and reevaluated.Professional focus puller and aspiring camera operator, Mark Lewis lives a solitary existence in the upper floor of the boarding house he has inherited from his father. Additionally working part time as a photographer of lewd materials, Mark pursues, films, and murders women he encounters in order to capture the face of true fear.The aforementioned blacklisting of Peeping Tom, perhaps difficult to understand for a modern audience, is a topic of much interest. Neither graphically violent nor sexually explicit, the reason for the film's utter dismissal is quite fascinating to consider&#x97;no, before you think of suggesting, it's not because it's terrible. One school of thought, and the one with which I happen to agree, is that the film's primary thematic fixation with voyeurism, and the concomitant allusions to the inherent perversity of cinema itself, was simply offensive to those critics who felt such an evaluation of their lives' pursuit was opprobrious. As well as the tongue-in-cheek humour of the jokes Powell makes concerning filmmaking, he raises serious questions regarding film and its vicariousness. It can't be healthy, watching all these films regards Mark's blind tenant, the mother of the woman with whom he begins to fall in love. Indeed, the film wonders what right we have to peer into the lives of others uninvited. Are we, being thrilled by the criminal investigation of the mysterious murders, as bad as Mark himself? No? What then of the compassionate sympathy we feel for him upon learning of the near-torture to which his father subjected him in pursuit of an understanding in the nature of fear? What the film does is create a character who, despite the atrocity of his actions, we are drawn to. His shyness, reservation, and almost comical self-awareness all combine to craft a character one can't help but feel affection toward. This, I think, was the definitive nail in the coffin of the film's future, its sympathising with so conflicted, complicated, and evil a character a fearful thing in itself. The key moment in this is when Mark realises he has faded too early on a shot of one of his victim's, forcing him to kill again. The horror, pain, and fear upon the character's face tells you all you need to know about him in one simple moment. A further moment in which a psychologist tells him the cure for his voyeuristic condition&#x97;three hours of analysis a week for a number of years&#x97;serves just as well to communicate the entirety of this character in just one expression. Praise for the creation of such a rich character lies entirely with Karlheinz B√∂hm, every line delivered with a pitch perfect pitifulness, agonising facial expressions, and an air of Peter Lorre style villainy so authentic as to have me scouring the internet in effort to find a familial tie between the two. I should add that the film's narrative is, in itself, darn entertaining for those who have been put off by discussions of thematic explorations of voyeurism in cinema (though shame on you if you have).Made ever more appealing by its effective banishment, Peeping Tom is the kind of film which almost instantly provokes thought that refuses to leave the mind for weeks, perhaps even months, afterward. Fascinating, compelling, ingenious, and masterful, its central character is amongst cinema's greatest in the feeling he engenders within the audience. A film about film on more levels than one, it raises several interesting questions which it leaves to us to answer. Masterpiece doesn't even begin to describe it.

In Million dollar Movie, Powell quotes each review, which must have marked him forever.

Could it be that the way he treats movie execs and directors in the movie itself could have been a partial reason? Those critics knew how true those egomaniacal tirades were.I am a great believe in reality and there were too many situations in which I was expected to suspend reality. Most of those women knew they were in danger, but acted as though they were mesmerized by this shy focus puller. He wasn't even a cameraman, except in his ambitions.Moira Shearer did a great job, but you can see the overly dramatic effect of those times in the way she set up , and over-acted. However, to be fair, that could have been just because she WAS a stand-in and would have over-acted in her role. Since this is a doll inside of a doll kind of movie, it was hard to tell when the movie was portraying an actual situation or when the movie was showing people in a movie.The acting by the young man was superior and I am surprised we never heard from HIM again. Could it be that the insult to his future career was even worse than it was for Powell? And what about the women in Powell's life Frankie and Pamela Brown? I have read Powell's memoir and nothing is said about the effect those women had on his production of this movie. YOu can tell by the documentary that making movies was Powell's life, yet the women seem to be placed in traditional roles of wife/mother and mistress.Columba, Powell's son, is used as the psycho as a child. One wonders what happened to both Kevin and Columba, Powell's sons. When the nude scene was filmed, Powell had both the boys present at the shooting so they could see what a naked woman looked like (reminds me of a scene from 'Curb Your Enthusiasm, when the cancer-ridden boy has his Make a Wish' turned down.

Psycho further solidified Hitchcock as a master director in the US; Peeping Tom ostracized Powell from the UK film industry and pretty much exiled him from his home country.The most visually shocking moment of Peeping Tom comes in the opening scene, a superbly crafted segment in which our antihero, Mark, approaches a prostitute, goes up to her room, and proceeds to kill her. As the audience, we see this whole scenario take place through the lens of Mark's camera, and we soon learn that he thrills himself by filming the victims that he murders. Mark could well be portrayed as a monster, but instead Powell chooses to make us feel close to him - not only to understand his actions but to sympathize with them. The films theme of voyeurism is seeped into every scene. Not only does it drive Mark to commit his insane actions, but it involves us, the audience, as well. It gives us the sense that we are watching something that we shouldn't, a feeling that caused the British critics to loathe the movie, one critic calling it the sickest and filthiest film I can remember seeing. The movie wouldn't have been nearly as effective without German actor Carl Boehm's portrayal of Mark. He plays this scarred and broken character to a subtle perfection - his awkward stances and nervous twitches really make the character feel alive; after the movie's premier in London, critics were scared to even shake the actor's hand afterward.Luckily, time has allowed Peeping Tom to mature into the classic it is known as today. Many film critics who panned the film on first release have now changed their opinion of it, most calling it one of the most important British films ever made. That isn't to say it is a perfect movie; the middle of the movie slumps a bit and the doomed relationship between Mark and his tenant, Vivian, could have been crafted with more tension. Still, Powell offers us one of the most disturbing looks into the limits of film and his product is sure to give you a deep psychological chill.

And it was that prettiness alone, and perhaps the hurt, childlike shyness, common to most introverted mentally ill sociopaths that drew Helen to long to know him better and yes, to love him.But it was the blind Mrs. Stephens who could see past his veil of deception and glimpse into the soul of the madman who lurked within the house, its very owner! -- Where the Stephens' lived.But Mark thrived on seeing the expression of fear in the Other's eyes, face, and contortion of the body as he prepared to strike the final blow. But he would not allow himself to see that fear in the face or body of Helen because he truly loved her, she had reached in and had done what no other living being had been able to do in all the years of his existence, Helen had humanized the un-human and un-hinged psychopath.Not even the Psychiatrist on the stage lift could see this, he was more concerned with the work of Mark's father than with Mark himself, and furthermore his incessant sneezing and simple wonder with what was around him provided the Psychiatrist with a disconnect that allowed Mark to conveniently, albeit painfully to dismiss him.Only Helen could reach in an find the lost soul of Mark Lewis, and she did in such a profound way as to almost waken him from his dark psychotic obsession, but the man, the beast within Mark could not be quelled and not even the noble and humanizing Helen would be enough to save him, for in the end, Mark has to face his own fear, the very thing that brought him to that point from his childhood, with its lights, and cameras, to document the fear, but only now his fear ends in death.And all of Helen's humanizing efforts have gone to naught, or have they?

The story revolves around Mark a young man who seems to have a major fascination with his camera and filming women but not just in anyway, you see Mark likes to film them as they watch in horror...their own deaths.Mark does this by having one of his tripod legs attached with what looks like a sharp spear-like end driving it into the woman's necks while getting that moneyshot for the camera. In comes a young girl who is taken to him (for whatever reason who knows) and soon tries to make him her main man. As the story progresses the girls mother realizes that Mark is a bit off and advises him to seek help. As expected Mark does not and continues to use his job working on the set of a film to his advantage killing one of the lead actresses body doubles.All this leads to a twisted revelation about Marks past and a rather tragic ending. Peeping Tom is one of those films that if handled by a juvenile director could have been a typical thriller lost in the shuffle however with the interesting back story of Marks character and his reasonings for doing what he was doing and the solid acting throughout I cannot help but recommend this to old school thriller buffs as well as fans of early exploitation as this film deserves that banner under its belt also for some of the more graphic for their time sequences that occur. In conclusion Peeping Tom is a classic within the thriller/horror genre and I give it a solid 9/10 classic.Peeping Tom is out on DVD in the states through Criterion and Strait-Jacket from Columbia TriStar. Check it out pygmies as though this does not pack the excessive gore punch that so many of the films have over the last several decades it still earns points just on coolness factor alone not to mention very well crafted storytelling.

The things which make THE RED SHOES interesting are the same things which make PEEPING TOM interesting Really bright, glossy magazine colors abound in both (and both movies were beginning to fade when I saw them, which is a bit distracting); the world, even in the outdoor shots, seems unusually contained, giving a sense of claustrophobia; and the acting is almost declamatory. Powell, then, is not a realist. I can't say I found much pleasure in either THE RED SHOES or PEEPING TOM, but I'd be lying if I didn't say there is a distinct vision both movies share. This leads me to my point. What bothers many people about PEEPING TOM is not that Powell was not up to his material but that he did not conform to the conventions other directors had established with similar subjects.  In all horror movies there is a moment when the audience wants to scream at the in innocent person walking into a trap. Powell has several such innocents in PEEPING TOM, but they have a fearlessness we reject. It's not that we simply can't believe they're so stupid as to walk into the killer's lair. What audiences can't stand is that at least one of the lone innocents doesn't seem to care if the killer's about to try to kill her. To this I say Michael Powell's movies are like dramas acted by fashion models and they're made for an audience attuned to the runway. Powell wants us to say, 'Interesting movie. Did you see the cut of his blazer?' Claustrophobic though his movies are (at least the two I've seen) there are several doffings of the fashionable cap to other directors. PEEPING TOM bears a definite similarity to Fritz Lang's M. The protagonists are, in fact so similar I can't think Powell didn't ask Carl Boehm to watch M once or twice. The Anna Masey dance is, perhaps, a tribute to the Freed Unit. Why should a movie about a serial killer only make tribute to movies about other serial killers. If Vincente Minnelli had wanted to make a slasher film, this would have been it. Hitchcock, I feel, used the motif of the corpse-laden trunk in FRENZY, which was Hitch's return to London. And the humorous scene where the portly elderly gentleman comes into the shop to buy pornographic pictures seems to me to be a tribute to Hithcock's cameos in his own movies. Watch NORTH BY NORTHWEST, which may feature Hitchcock's lengthiest cameo. He's dressed the same way the man in this scene is.  The truly horrifying scenes are not the ones where the killer films the murders he commits, but the ones of the killer's childhood. I noticed they're the only scenes which seem realistic. This is further proof that Powell didn't falter here. He hid the real terror in plain sight.

Michael Powell once said I make a film that nobody wants to see and then, thirty years later, everybody has either seen it or wants to see it. Roger Ebert stated that The movies make us into voyeurs. We sit in the dark, watching other people's lives. It is the bargain the cinema strikes with us, although most films are too well-behaved to mention it. Once you go beyond the controversial subject, what is under the surface is a movie that has many psychological complexities, it would be accurate to say the on the surface the movie is about the relationship between a son and a father and also the victims. That in my opinion is what makes Peeping Tom so great, it is a highly original horror movie that was years ahead of its time, it is also an extremely intelligent movie that has a lot say about social commentary.

It was a film a head of its time.Mark Lewis (Carl Boehm) is a focus puller at a film studio and aspiring director who takes his 8mm camera everywhere he goes. He is a quiet, shy man who lives alone, has few friends and was a victim of his father's psychological experiments. But Mark is a serial killer and wants to make documentary about his activities.Peeping Tom is a certainly a bold film for time and it easy to see why it was controversial when it was first released. Powell keeps a very creepy atmosphere throughout the film, amplified by Boehm's performance, giving his character a quiet, softly spoken demeanour and it was an uneasy experience to be around it.Peeping Tom has a very voyeuristic look, a deliberately choice, particularly when see the murders through the camera. This is a film about obsession and it is even more poignant now due to the information age we live where we have 24 hour media, Youtube, social media and mini-cameras and phone cameras. This is a film that has many themes during the running time, focusing on obsession of death and pain, fear, the growing use of technology, the efforts of someone having in private life and how a serial killer would function, as well as some satire about the British film industry.It is always difficult to make a film focusing on a unlikeable character, but Powell and Boehm make it work due to the complexities of Mark's character. Mark was a man who was a victim of his father who tortured him as a child in the name of intelligential pursuit and this is a film that tries to be more grounded with its look at a serial killer he is not a man who seems to take pleasure from his actions and does it out of compulsion. He cannot even be away from his camera. This is also a film that shows a serial killer need to keep trophies. Yet at the same time Powell never justifies what Mark does.Peeping Tom is of course an important film due to its subject matter and its style, particularly the POV approach and it a compelling psychological-thriller/horror-thriller. It is classic it deserves to be and it shame that Powell did not get to it. "},{"Title":"Camera-blindness","Date":"13 October 2011","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Thriller","Review":" The film that effectively ended Michael Powell's career as a filmmaker, a dark, subversive, infamous thriller about a young camera man filming his murder spree. Curious how reviled it was at the time, considering that Psycho came out only three months later and only further cemented Hitchcock as the purveyor of darkest fears - but Hitch learned from Powell's failure and released the film without press screenings for the self-appointed moral guardians that condemned Powell's film.The outer story about the emotionally scarred young man replicating his childhood trauma is not terribly interesting; it's lurid, feverish, and eventually collapses upon itself in a heap of symbolic hysteria - and all this is equally well a part of the movie's indelible idiosynchracy. I can't gauge how much Powell invested of himself in this part, or whether or not he merely used as adequate material to graft upon it what essentially matters about the film. He did have a reputation as cruel man on set, so perhaps he envisioned himself as this man. As part of the Archers he was after all responsible for the camera, the lights, the choreography, all of this guarantees a film that is tightly constructed, elegant with colors and motions.What actually matters here though, why it has endured the way it has among cinephiles, is the essay on cinema. Hitchcock himself repeatedly danced around this, the obsession with seeing and being seen - more pertinently in Rear Window and Vertigo - and DePalma borrowed from both.The idea is that the man grew up in a movie, his father constantly filming him (he was looking to study fear and this is what the son growing up is replicating, the search for the perfect closeup of fear). Of course by pointing a camera, by staging actions, he was essentially altering, shaping, contorting the nascent life - its own comment on the ineffability of film to capture a pure, true reality.For his dayjob, he's doing grunt work as a focus puller on a dumb studio film. His job is to measure distances, to pull image into focus and clarity. The knowledge from this he pours into his own personal project, where he's looking to recapture that clarity of vision that was robbed from him at childhood. So by casting himself in his father's shoes he forcibly directs his own film about emotional pains. It is all connected by people seeing, yet failing to.- the policemen who fail to see the suspect in their own midst, even when he's hiding right above them or they point flashlights at him.- the psychoanalyst who instead of seeing the man's plea for help, is only looking to get his father's manuscripts.- the girl who the man bares his soul to in their first encounter, is slightly perturbed, but goes on to court him because 'he has a quality'. She even petitions his help on a book she is writing about a 'magic camera' that allows grownups to see their inner child. Precisely the thing he showed her in their first meeting.Of course the only one who can see through to the wrecked soul is the blind mother. It's not merely symbolic conjecture that only she can see; by not seeing, by not being dazzled by the cinematic artifice everyone else is embroiled in, she can have a direct experience of the human person.Another disquieting comment on the effects of a replicated reality; the man is building all of this into a movie, filming bits here and there, but when the girl takes away this crutch, the camera he's always carrying around, he feels liberated. Now he can live in actual life, instead of the self-perpetuating fantasy.Of course we're shown early in the film how people, perfectly decent family men, will covertly seek out the lurid content he shoots, who'd pay to live that fantasy. But would they similarly seek out the more gruesome stuff that he keeps for himself? Of course they would, it's the film we have paid to see.So for all intents and purposes, and this is what is most subversive about the film, more keenly that it was made by a man who lived an entire life in movies and so knows from the inside, it's a film that fervently denounces the powers of cinema; the lens cannot offer us a true reflection, a constructive view of life, Powell posits, but like the final image offered the victims moments before their death, only a distortion of the pained soul. More erudite films have been made since - and well before - about the blurred boundaries reality and fiction. But this remains one of the most feverish, hopeless, pathetic visions of delusion.

I sought it out with interest after reading its screenwriter, Leo Marks' autobiography ('Between Silk and Cyanide', written in 1998) on his (brilliant) WW2 years as head cryptographer (at the tender ages of 20 to 25!) of the coding department at Britain's SOE (special operations executive), the group which sent the agents into German-occupied Europe (to, as Churchill put it, 'set Europe ablaze'). Marks' father ran the famous 2nd hand bookshop at 84 Charing Cross Road, the subject of Helen Hanff's book.Marks' book is a real gut wrencher, as he gives the final briefing to people, knowing they are going to certain death. Its an eye-opener in its rendition of the inside story of SOE. He talks of his friendships with some of the great heroes of our time (Violet Szabo, of 'Carve Her Name with Pride' - Marks wrote the famous code-key poem featured in the movie; Yeo-Thomas, 'the White Rabbit'; 'Odette'; 'Madeleine'; Nancy Wake), a large number of whom died in Europe, either killed in action, tortured to death or murdered in concentration camps, some the subject of Nazi 'medical experiments'. It has an underlying wry humour (no doubt what kept Leo sane) together with moments in which he pours out the agony or his soul. And his exhaustion as the war closes is palpable.I think all this explains how he dredged up a character like Mark Lewis in 'Peeping Tom' ...... Lewis is all that is evil, and some of what is good, in us all ....... including Marks himself (note Leo Marks .... Mark Lewis).The film is pretty tame by 2004 standards but would have been very shocking in 1960 - as critics' reviews at the time clearly showed ...... eg, one said of it, ' ... the sickest and filthiest film I ever remember seeing'. Another..... 'From its slumbering, mildly salacious beginning to its appallingly masochistic and depraved climax, it is wholly evil'. Heavy stuff!

But as a convincing or scary psycho- thriller it will strike anyone familiar with Hitchcock before Powell, Polanski at the same time, and Kubrick, Shyamalan, or even Lynch more recently, that this is dull potatoes. It's not a bad film, not by any means, and I'll go so far as to say the best of this movie is as good as any-- any--movie of this type. The flashback scenes are so cold and cruel they are disturbing, but in a superbly suggestive and restrained way. If only the vehicle for them (the rest of the film) made the whole journey equally amazing.The jazzy jazz (film score jazz), the bright colors (everyone seems to have red hair), and the layered filming (lots of cameramen--behind and in front of the camera) all make for a perky film. It has a sensational twist the rules the movie, and this requires a real suspension of disbelief because psychology is never so simple, thankfully. The women (the victims are all women) are weirdly powerless to fight back, especially given the attacker's bizarre approach. And the final revelation of the mirror only makes it more absurd--as if this would ever be possible. And all those tape recorders ready to play their mournful wails all at once? Come on, Mr. Powell. Is this a farce?Maybe it is! That's worth some thought. But taken more normally, it's all surface effect, and some good secondary acting (all those British bit parts).In fact, I like the lead actress a lot, Anna Massey, because she is very real indeed, and not quite the dull starlet of many films of this period (she reappears in a much later Hitchcock film with a more believable and more frightening murderer, Frenzy). The lead man, the bad guy, is Karlheinz Bohm, a bizarre choice, more a pretty type than a great actor, but he serves as a good post-Nazi German we can love to hate for external reasons. I'm not sure where his Germanic speaking style comes from, since his dad appears to be very British. The direction? Crisp, modern, affected, artsy, fun. There's no flaw with the overall look, really--the flaw is with the story, the writing, and the way the director leads us through the events. Powell is a legend among British filmmakers, and his partnership with Pressburger is special, for sure. And many of their films are thoughtful and touching, though sometimes a bit artful for an American taste more inclined to the lush excess of Sirk or Kubrick or the general high standards of late studio stuff from Wilder or, yes, Hitchcock. Peeping Tom is Powell on his own, and maybe it's no coincidence that he once worked under Hitchcock. Maybe this is his inner psychokiller coming out--the main character is a cinematographer, after all. But then, it can't be. It's too shallow and silly a depiction.This film has its fans for good reason--it is a kind of pre-Blue Velvet trip, depending on its violent weirdness more than real savvy or originality. Me, personally--I need more depth or breadth, somehow. Or even just more of the best of what is here.

Further, would he, knowing that he was being watched by a plain-clothes policeman, kill the model he worked with regularly and leave her body to be discovered by his 'employer' the proprietor of the tobacconists' shop with a sideline in soft porn.

Thank god people don't speak like that anymore. It's not the poor girl's fault, though - anyone who puts this rubbish in the same brackets with Psycho must be as blind as her whiskey gulping mother downstairs. With his bawdy lips and perfectly parted hair, Boehm looks more like someone loitering in public toilets than a serial killer with a soul whom we're supposed to feel for (this apparently being the spin regarding the serial killer issue, cause, you see, Boehm's character suffered childhood abuse by his scientist father who was obviously a nutter). So it's not Boehm's fault either. At one point, when his character seems fascinated by one of the girls' disfigured face, you almost think, in disbelief, that the film is about to go down the path of The Spiral Staircase - another lukewarm horror/thriller which at least has some redeeming qualities. Well, mercifully it doesn't go that way, but that's hardly a plus - this is as horrific as a meowing cat and as thrilling as a wind in the toilet bowl. The piano solo score sounds like it was composed by the least talented student in Ravel's class, the one taken on board out of sheer pity. I haven't seen any of Michael Powell's preceding, apparently acclaimed films - nor have I any desire to do so after viewing this spineless lemonade. No small wonder everyone hated it - not because it's a misunderstood masterpiece ahead of its time, but because it's utterly and terminally bad, equally as bad today as it was in 1960. True, the first two or three minutes of the film seem vaguely promising - but then every film is good at the beginning, it's how it carries on that counts. Hitchcock must have laughed out aloud - if indeed he ever wasted time viewing this - and in his hands this film might actually have worked, subject to him agreeing to direct such an awful, awful script.

There is a limit to who can be an anti-hero. Identifying with Mark is nearly impossible - groups and sub-cultures the world over have devised codes of common identity, but also methods of exclusion; all of whom would line up to exclude Mark. Mark seems to have slightly slimy skin, glassy eyes, creepy plasticine lips. Whatever conceits are credited to this movie, the lead is just comprehensively icky; to look at, to examine, but mostly to be asked to identify with, and the performance that Powell got out of him is unsubtle. But Mark has been given nothing to do for the whole movie.Powell's big problem is that he's made the type of movie most likely to be championed by skittish weirdos who actually are sadistic voyeurs, harboring their own twisted secrets; that or the type who credit average efforts with superlative qualities. Anna Massey as chirpy Suzie Wholesome, a variety found only in British films, is off-the-charts irritating. Conceived as the films Manichean anti-Mark, she traipses through this like a sexless, earnest Alice in wonderland; as in Oh Mark, I'm ever so keen to view your snuff films.

His first victim is a prostitute, who he follows into her apartment, only to murder through the watchful eye of the camera. Mark's obsession becomes confronted by his neighbour Helen (Anna Massey), his sweet-natured neighbour, who opens up her heart to the much troubled man.This breakthrough British thriller film is most renowned for being the end to director Michael Powell, as the controversial subject matter was harshly received by critics. Through the years it did garner a cult status and can definitely by considered a movie way ahead of its time, albeit that time has passed, leaving a somewhat outdated shell of a movie, lacking in acting and directorial pizazz. Story lines also seem dated as the killer's traumatic motivation seem somewhat questionable Unlike Italian giallo cinema with layers of style holding the test of time (despite wooden acting and tired scripts) Peeping Tom comes off as historically significant, but severely lacking from the perspective of a modern-day viewer. Boehm's portrayal stills carries some weight, but Massey and the trio of murdered women come off forced and false, as screams of terror as staged to irksome exaggeration (albeit in accordance with acting in the era).There are some interesting plot elements within, as movies are portrayed as harbingers of death and fear. Fear punctuated by watching yourself die, while death itself is brought about by the camera. Nonetheless the concept itself is just used as a tool for the thriller, not as a intellectual commentary, hence offering a suggestion for expansion on the theme (possibly a remake), but otherwise not relevant for modern cinema.

Once the viewer sees the killer's face, the film loses its mystery, my main motive for watching Peeping Tom.Still, the film has its merits, mostly in the form of clever cinematography, spooky sound effects and music. In the cavernous hall where Viv (lovely Moira Shearer) does her jazz dance, a bright light flashes suddenly in her face, followed by a delay, then another bright light, then repeated, suggesting some hidden menace. Echoes in the same sequence and elsewhere add to the suspense. The pounding piano score likewise contributes a sense of fear. So while the film may be devoid of mystery, through its non-script elements it does contain some suspense.Yet, despite that, Peeping Tom, for me, is far from being the masterpiece so described by its fans. The main problem is the script. The central character, Mark Lewis (Karl Bohm), is so bland and outwardly neutral he's boring. The child psychology back-story muddles the plot. Too much dialogue dilutes suspense. Some scenes are unnecessary or too prolonged. And the deep themes, related to voyeurism, fear, and movie-making, though significant, are confusing and convoluted.In addition, the garish colors set an inappropriate tone for a psychological thriller. B&W would have been more effective. Casting of Karl Bohm may have been a mistake, as his subtly fey manner contradicts the character of Mark. Actress Anna Massey, who plays Helen, annoyingly chirps and tweets her way through the plot as Mark's shockingly na√Øve girlfriend.There is no humor at all in this film, which takes itself very, very seriously. Its multidimensional cerebral subtext thus conveys the impression that it was meant for an intellectual audience. Though the suspense helps offset some of the film's weaknesses, I find Peeping Tom just a tad pretentious.

The acting throughout is stilted and mannered, not foreboding or menacing as the director probably thought he was achieving, so the viewer eventually wants to say Pleeze, get on with it, alright?The plot is creative enough but the twists and turns make you dizzy. Because of the weak script and story line the police have to be inept beyond imagining, which they obligingly are, relieving the viewer of any concern that they might catch up with the killer before he carries out his final act, so we are just along for the ride. The skin was probably a come-on in the '60s but in the second decade of the 21st century it is simply quaint, fair enough. But overall it means this second-rate thriller does not really measure up, and no. 78 on the list of greatest British films is more than generous.The old Bell & Howell 16mm camera is really cool. It would have been great if it had been anywhere near that easy to feed the film through a projector, though. Nobody ever had the equipment to process even B&W movie film at home the way Lewis does, either, but the plot requires it, since he would hardly have been able to take it to the drugstore, considering the subject matter. Not to beat a dead horse too much, even if he had been able to process reversal/transparency film at home it would have had to be in total darkness, not under the spooky safelights.

Released in the same year as that other groundbreaking film about a serial killer, Psycho, the critical and commercial fates of these two movies could not really be further apart. Psycho went on to achieve huge commercial success and was soon regarded &#x96; rightfully &#x96; as a classic of the medium. Peeping Tom on the other hand was reviled by the critics and died a death, only being revived in the 70's. The reasons for this are not especially hard to understand with the benefit of hindsight. Where Psycho worked quite brilliantly as a horror-thriller par excellence, Peeping Tom is a complex work that asks us to empathize with its central killer. There's no mystery and much of the focus is on the psychology of a troubled man, and it's also an examination on the nature of thriller cinema, i.e. the pleasure in looking at depictions of fear. The critics of the day were appalled that Powell would depict a serial killer in a sympathetic light and were disgusted in the sleazy undercurrents and probably in the complex questions the film asked its audience. Peeping Tom was clearly a film too far ahead of it's time for its own good.As with Powell films in general there is a great use of colour. So despite its very dark subject matter, this is a beautiful looking film. You do have to wonder if it had been shot in black and white would it have generated quite as much revulsion? At the time thrillers were almost always in B&W, perhaps this too threw audiences at the time as well as the idea of killer as victim. But also, unlike Psycho, there is no sense of typical closure in Peeping Tom. The serial killer is clearly a psychologically disturbed man who was tortured by his father as a boy so his demise at the end has a certain tragic element to it as opposed to the more traditional death of the evil monster that was the norm. Essentially Peeping Tom is far from an ordinary film on a number of levels. It stands apart from the films of it's time, under-appreciated and reviled. Of course it has since achieved a great deal of respect but even today it seems like quite an odd film in the way it is about a serial killer, yet doesn't really focus on thriller set-pieces. It's a true one off.

Despite the ravings of Coppola and Scorsese, it's a seriously underwhelming classic with only a few scenes of suspense, long stretches of dialogue, and most of the victim's performances so stilted and unlikeable, you don't necessarily disapprove of Carl Boehm knocking off the various tarts and actresses. Another question why are all these women, both moral and immoral, so drawn to Boehm's barely transparent neuroses? Knowing the U.K.'s penchant for creating nasty thrillers with moments of atrocity and controversy, it's hard to fathom the movie being banned and shunned by the masses back in 1960. Boehm as the killer is easily the best part, and the man literally moves, lisps, trembles and (of course) murders like some specie of worm. An unforgettable performance in a not so unforgettable thriller, despite all the hype. Still, it can't be denied that Michael Mann's sleek Manhunter and practically EVERY billionth movie about serial killers to follow--most of them unwelcome and diluted trash--owe a monumental debt to Powell's exploration of the mind of a killer. It definitely surpasses anything Hitchcock was doing at the time.

And actually I was more than surprised with the results, though I don't hold it up that high like others do, but still it's worthy of any horror collection.Obviously I wouldn't put it passed it being highly controversial in its heyday. You could call it a trend setter actually because I don't think the audience back then would've seen anything quite like this or know what to expect. It's incredibly nasty and sordid in its depiction of the context and shocks. Although, dated now but you can see the many influences for future projects. Director Michael Powell's accomplished but yet imposing direction stages such subtle cruelty of a psychological kind that rifts along with an intense performance by Carl Boehm. Simply it's a sublime performance by Boehm with his shyness, softly spoken voice, but it was his cold stare that had such a piercing effect. He is perfect in showing that of a fearful mind and how it all translates into obsession that he has trouble fighting these temptations. The well diverse plot is laced out with a creepy undertone that knows how to put you off balance, but also provides us with a terrifying look at fear and when temptations take hold that it's no easy task to overcome. Also presented with such discomfort are the attacks on unknowingly victims. The violence is hardly graphic, but more suggestive, which really did sneak up on you. The heart pounding score, which puts in a powerful showing, also contributed this. The cinematography was more than adequate with some inventive sparks on show. It held pretty intrusive detail as if he sees his own life behind the camera and that being in some POV shots. The tight editing also helps shaped the film too. The screenplay comes up with a seedy premise and good character development along the way. The rest of the performances were so-so although Maxine Audley short role as the blind Mrs. Stephens added a bit of bite and offbeat humour. One of my downers would be that at times it kind of felt empty and shallow. Also it was predictable when you knew something bad is going to happen, its just your waiting for it to occur, but at least the score sustained the tension until it happened. So basically this novelty thriller is a look inside the head of a disturbed fella, which will get the skin crawling.A revealing and innovative British thriller where the terror eventuates from the lead performance, strong score, precise direction and the power of suggestion.

Now why does Carl have to prey upon women for his 'experiments'? Is it because they scare easier, they are more used to looking at themselves, & usually do not fight back? A segment where Moira Shearer as a soon-to-be-butchered extra pirouetting in front of Carl will remind Powell fans of the same Shearer doing the same routine in front of a obsessed ballet director Anton Walbrook in 'The Red Shoes' two decades earlier. So what's the difference in the 2 sequences - Shearer ends up with blood all over her thanks to these demanding men in front of her!Anyway, behind the blood & scares - which anyway are not too convincing for today's post-Se7en generation - Powell gives a very honest, & hence disturbing, view of the process of film making.

The plot is a little too heavy-handed and literal at times, the characters somewhat cartoonish, and the pacing leaden.Really, the biggest flaw with the film is the casting of Carl Boehm in the roll of Mark. Looking somewhat like the offspring of Joseph Cotton and Peter Lorre in one of 'Late Night with Conan O'Brien's 'If They Mated' routines, Boehm plays crazy all right. That the problem, though That's *all* he does. At no point did I believe that Mark is capable of holding down not one but two jobs. Perhaps the British standards of creeping out your fellow employees is different from ours here in the States, but the first time Mark locked eyes on me while mumbling in that high, lispy, vaguely accented voice of his, I'd be on the phone with Human Resources like that.What makes Norman Bates such a compelling character is that he does have the ability to function in society from time to time. He can be charming, friendly, and even funny when he wants to be. Mark, however, is incapable of any of these qualities. His timidity is so pronounced that it's hard to believe he could ever screw up the courage to actually kill someone because that would require human interaction. And the idea that anyone--even someone as apparently oblivious as or with the appallingly low standards of Helen--could actually fall in love with someone Mark is hard to accept. Marion definitely sympathizes with Norman, but it is a pitying sort of sympathy. She senses there's something not quite right about Norman, and because of that at no point can she ever feel a romantic attraction toward him. Norman is irreversibly deranged and without hope. 'Peeping Tom,' on the other hand, seems to suggest that Mark *can* lead a normal life and perhaps even have a girlfriend if he just stops his habit of killing women.

It's a dreary fetish film, handsomely-made but ridiculous in conception and execution. Carl Boehm is horribly fey and (intentionally) creepy as a movie-camera technician/cheesecake photographer who, taking a cue from his twisted father, is fascinated with recording human fear on film; he entraps women and murders them, his movie-camera always at the ready. There's a nosy young woman who lives downstairs who has taken a liking to him, but will she cure him or be his next victim? The picture does looks great, as only a Michael Powell movie will, but the leading psychopath has no interesting dimensions--he's just a sniveling weakling; we get background information on him, but no insights. Nice to see Moira Shearer again (she, the ballerina from Powell's 1948 classic The Red Shoes), and the film's only pleasurable moment is when she does a jazzy dance. Fetish films are always going to be uncomfortable or disturbing, but this picture is pervasively demented, not chilling; worse, the colorful production throws off the tone, making the narrative seem lively when it should be more somber. Powell overdirects the actors, and has Boehm doing a Peter Lorre, but forgets to make the characters human or real; his strongest suit is surreality, but that doesn't work for Powell here because the scenario doesn't call for it, so the characters just seem foolishly hyped-up (except for the girl's blind mother, who has some taut moments). Now a cult film, Peeping Tom went unseen for years but has since drawn comparisons to Hitchcock. *1/2 from **** "}{"Title":"Little Mister Obsessive","Date":"25 December 2015","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Thriller","Review":" Well, I have found out about Peeping Tom in 2011's Scream 4, and I'm not ashamed in confessing that.

From the get go we know who is the killer... we just don't know why or how he does that. There aren't lots of remarkable moments; actually, the only scene that really caught my attention was the one in which the old woman almost ASKED to be murdered, saying a lot of irritating things to Lewis. That scene felt good because the actress was professional, otherwise there wouldn't be such nice atmosphere anyways. In my opinion, Peeping Tom has a good premise that could have walked in a much better way; the script is just too raw to develop something interesting.

Her features -- eyes, nose, lips, chin, neck -- seem to have been plucked at random from some genetic hat and flung together by the creator and, happily, came out right, almost by accident. Half the time I couldn't tell whether a scene was aimless or held some deeper, clinical significance that was lost on a dullard like me.The bare bones of the story are plain enough. Handsome, introverted, young Karlheinz B√∂hm works as some kind of focus puller in the British movie industry. He occupies the top floor of a rooming house and the largest room is dark and filled with mysterious cinematographic junk, like one of those chambers in a horror movie.Due do his child abuse, he loves to see women being frightened and then he kills them with a sharp spike on the end of one of the feet of his tripod, filming their faces all the time. He doesn't do it very often but when he does, she switches his persona from his usual reticent, shambling self, to a cockeyed maniac.Is there hope for him? I mean, we really DO want him to get caught or at least stop committing these little sins because he's pathetic. He sounds like Peter Lorre. For a few moment, in the middle of the film, yes, there seems to be a way out of his obsession. Anna Massey, a winsome young lady of twenty one, talks him into a date and more or less forces him to leave his movie camera and tripod behind. He's surprised to find he's enjoyed himself and promises himself never to kill her -- unless he sees her frightened.As the lunatic, B√∂hm is bland. Anna Massey is far more interesting. When she speaks, it seems that only her lips are moving while the rest of her face remains at rest. (That really IS worth making a movie about.) Moira Shearer has a small role as one of the first victims. She's given some clunky choreography except that she gets to bust one or two ballet moves that I think are called kick fans. She's quite a dancer. She's the only woman I've ever seen who can be en pointe sitting down.Nobody else is of much importance except Massey's blind mother, Maxine Audley, who makes up for the challenge to her sight by being practically clairvoyant. The police are no more than drones.It's not hard to understand why B√∂hm is more comfortable with cameras than with people. Conversing with other people is an extremely complicated business. It's only because we do it so often that it seems routine. But it's not. We have to manage our body language, our facial expressions, our utterances, our inflections, and the distance we keep between ourselves and the other. We don't notice these commonplace decisions except in people who make the wrong ones, as schizophrenics do.But those careful and precise judgments don't need to be made when a camera or a computer or radio can act as a transducer, shielding us from the judgment of others. We're safe behind that baffle. You doubt? Ever have stage fright? Well extreme introverts like B√∂hm have people fright.But, in the end, I don't know what to make of this movie. It's a mistake to read too much into a thing. It's like looking at a random assortment of stars in the sky and connecting them in such a way that you wind up with the outline of a bull or, for the Chinese, a rat. The prominent director may have led some viewers to make that error, but I'll have it some points for its meanderings being the result of deliberation; for the rest, felix culpa.

To help make ends meet, Mark lets part of the house out; one of his tenants being Helen Stephens, a sweet young woman who befriends him out of pity. Throughout the film Mark struggles to conceal his voyeuristic habit from her.Mark Lewis is not just a peeping tom, however, he's a murderer who records his crimes for warped posterity. Despite this, the backlash that Peeping Tom faced in 1960 seems rather amazing today. Clearly, the film is going to date, it's 52 years old, but so is Psycho, which covers similar ground but in a more graphic manner.In a screening of the Hitchcock classic at my local independent cinema, I was surprised by the genuine anxiety I felt during the half-hour or so before the shower scene. This is the film's defining moment; it is a classic example of a director battering his audience with what they believe is explicit violence when in fact he has shown very little. Michael Powell makes no such illusions in this film - he shows very little, period. For example, in this scene, Mark approaches one of his victims with a blade attached to his camera, and just before the blade makes contact, the woman falls out of frame, shrilly screaming Mark!.Most modern audiences will agree that this just doesn't cut it anymore. This scene depicts the creation of a snuff film, but it doesn't feel like it, does it? Mark shares common ground with people like Leonard Lake and Charles Ng, the sordid serial killer partnership whose recordings make for deeply, deeply disturbing viewing. Peeping Tom should feel like a descent into one man's world of degeneracy, a twisted existence that's punctuated by lapses into frenzied sexual violence and eroticised death. This can be done without tasteless exploitation, the most germane example I can think of is Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer (1986). Powell should be commended for approaching these darkest of themes, but today, his work just doesn't hold up. To think this film was given an '18' certificate as recently as 2001 is nothing short of baffling. The BBFC have since given the film a 15 certificate, but I think a 12 rating is more appropriate.The lack of visceral edge is exacerbated by poor acting from almost the entire cast. Performances both wooden and overacted drag you further out of the film; it becomes an even bigger problem than its dated violence. However, thanks to Carl Boehm's generally competent performance, Mark Lewis is the only interesting and somewhat credible character, but even Boehm is guilty of being badly stilted in places.The only thing that's noteworthy about this film is its historical audacity. This film was addressing themes that didn't become mainstream until the 70s, the New Hollywood era of rapidly changing opinions on sex and violence. If it had been released 15 years later and not championed by Martin Scorsese and various critics, it may well have faded into obscurity.50% "},{"Title":"Why was it banned?","Date":"23 July 2002","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Thriller","Review":"  I saw Peeping tom after its re-release a year ago after it was banned.

He also kills women--he stabs them in the throat with a knife while filming their dying reactions. It seems he does this because his father (Michael Powell) emotionally abused him as a child. Then he meets and starts to fall in love with neighbor Helen Stephens (Anne Massey) but can he control his urges to kill her? This film was considered a disgusting piece of trash back in 1960. It single handedly destroyed director Michael Powell's career. It was withdrawn from circulation almost immediately. It didn't show up in America until two years later with about 15 minutes cut out! It wasn't shown or restored until 1980 when director Martin Scorsese started an interest in director Powell. In 1980 it was considered a masterpiece. It's not THAT good but it's not that bad either.I didn't see it until 1986 on video. I wasn't impressed--I was bored and couldn't figure out what the big deal was. I now realize that the film couldn't possibly live up to the hype about it. Seeing it now (in 2005) with all the furor about it long gone, I like it a lot more. I wasn't bored this time around. It's easy to see why this shocked people in 1960--there's nothing really explicit about it but the horrible experiments a doctor performs on his own son (he filmed them) and basic theme was way too strong--it was years ahead of its time. Today it's not quite as shocking and the blatantly obvious sexual symbolism (shown again and again) seems kind of silly. But, for its time, it was strong stuff. I think so many people today find it boring because they were expecting a strong, explicit horror film which this isn't (with the exception of one none of the killings are shown).The acting helps--Carl Boehm (a German actor) ALMOST covers his accent (it slips through a few times) but delivers a very good, well-done performance--you can really see how his abuse as a child makes him do what he does. Massey is young and pretty good as Helen. She sometimes underplays the role a bit but most of the time she's right on target (especially at the end). Also Maxine Audley throws in a strong performance as her mother. Beautifully directed by Powell too.So it is worth seeing--just don't expect something really shocking--you'll be disappointed. It's good that Powell lived to see this film get the acclaim it deserved (he died in 1990). One thing--this is NOT for children. It will either bore them or shock them. I give it an 8.

After that, I'd like to do one on redheads in film (and how they season our notions of sex roles). This film will feature prominently in both; it is a very important event. Too bad it is not good or effective.The self-reference is plain at the first level it is a film about the film community, a (documentary) film about the making of a documentary. But it goes deeper the reason for the filmmaker's obsession was because he was filmed himself; the reason for the victim's fear is that they saw themselves being filmed. Film as death. Pictures as sex. The camera as both self-revealer, sexual penetrator and weapon. Even the setup in the film-within has doubling the standin is the one targeted. The girlfriend is a writer. The filmmaker is a `focus-puller' which is a matter of determining what layer is clear.So what's wrong? The primary problem is that filmmaker needs to be extraordinarily intelligent. Kubrick can and has done this. Soderbergh maybe. Tarkovsky surely. Powell just isn't up to it. But there are deeper problems that keep this from greatness.The business about Freud. He is used as token for the way the world of the mind works. In fact, Freud was more a compelling storyteller than a scientist. His theories had more to do with `making sense' in narrative than with developing new laws. Using a storyteller as the clockmaker for the story you are telling would have been a newly sweet and deep level of the self-reference, but Powell seems to have taken Freud quite seriously. Might have worked 40 years ago. Surely doesn't now.But there is another problem. The British acting tradition is one of stepping into the character and representing the direct elements needed to move the story along. There's none of this North American conceit of `becoming' the character and giving both the character and the actor's `interpretation' of the character. That means that American actors have the basic capability to play multiple levels (usually irony) and British actors do not. It really hurts here, and my own opinion is that this attempt was what `blacklisted' Powell after this film. He was messing with a self-interested tradition that simply squashed him.The redhead thing really interests me. Obviously, there's something going on here the actress and her standin; the girlfriend and her mother; the scarred model and the photographer himself are all redheads. My own theory is that redheads play roles that are more knowing than blonds and particularly so in just this type of cinematic self-reference. It surely holds here. I can't quite reconcile that with Massey's ridiculous chirp in reading the lines and have to suppose (from Babs in `Frenzy') that it is just an artifact of some quaint British convention.

It is not helped out either, by the script which is rather plodding and clunky. It is sad that this film was made in 1960, where the restrictions on what can or can not be shown reduce the impact of important scenes. When the scenes relating to nudity are none existent, and there is a lack of gore, then it does lose a creepiness which would have made for a more disturbing atmosphere. If a film about a peeping Tom can not explicitly show what he is looking at, then you end up with a much tamer film than the plot demands. For the early sixties this film would genuinely push the limits of what was acceptable, but its failure to show more explicit scenes reduces the film, to a rather po-faced and not very scary horror. This film is unlikely therefore to disturb a more modern day audience, used to sex, violence and nudity. If the script was a lot better, then perhaps you would not need the above aspects to help give the film edge. You may find that the edge of the film is also lacking, because of the stultifying middle class nature of the characters. The script is subtle as brick to the head, although there are some witty moments. The old man in the newsagents, surreptitiously wanting dirty photographs is actually pretty funny, but unfortunately there is little of that humour through out the rest of the film. The peeping Tom character himself is cold, but not in a horror chilling way, just in a bland, rather empty, so what sort of way. There is the germ of an interesting story here, and a modern day version might have played up more on the salacious voyeurism of media in comparison to that of the peeping tom. It would also have probably been far darker and actually rather ironically more sympathetic to the plight of the victims. By the end of the film you don't care about the death of the peeping Tom, which with the characters tragic back-story you should be expected to do,at least so to some degree.This film is probably influential despite its flaws. There maybe echoes of the film's projection scenes in Taxi driver. For example Travis Bickle taking his date to a soft porn movie, when they have just met.There is also a slightly weird and similar atmosphere in the 70's film, the cat and the canary. The campiness towards the end of that film appears similar to the prevailing mood of peeping Tom. I also think the film Blow-up in 1966 is influenced by Peeping Tom, however Blow-up goes into territory that Peeping Tom can not do so, and you may find it more interesting film as a result.Although considered a cult classic Peeping Tom is a real disappointment. It just cannot get around the problems caused by heavy handed censorship. It's script is clumsy and the characters rather uninteresting, which does not help the film along in any significant way. I think it is worth watching the once, as it is considered an important cult film. I think you will probably find the film is a failure overall however.

At the very least, this fact should be revealed at, I dunno, an important moment in the plot? A climax? Some kind of turning point? Not just arbitrarily before the film rambles on mercilessly.

Also starring Moira Shearer as Vivian, Maxine Audley as Mrs. Stephens, Esmond Knight as Arthur Baden, Bartlett Mullins as Mr. Peters - News Agent Shop Owner, Shirley Anne Field as Pauline Shields, Michael Goodliffe as Don Jarvis, Brenda Bruce as Dora, Martin Miller as Dr. Rosen, Pamela Green as Milly, Jack Watson as Chief Insp. Gregg and Powell himself as Mr. Lewis. Whereas Psycho used the voyeurism theme for a brief moment involving Anthony Perkins looking through a hole at Janet Leigh, this exploits that further, I have almost never been so freaked out by an old film before. This is up with all the great nut-case films, following future releases like Falling Down, Fatal Attraction, Misery and One Hour Photo, I can see why Powell's career went down the tubes after, it was just too freaky. It was number 85 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments. Very good! "},{"Title":"Pooping Tom This movie is what came out.","Date":"26 February 2009","Score":"6 out of 21 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Thriller","Review":" Critics are amusing. Most of them are desperate middle-aged men with about as much personality as a dying animal. Because of these traits, it's obvious the kinds of films they will life and the kinds they won't. Anything with originality, anything that breaks the mold, anything with a punk edge is immediately labeled as trash. Anything with pretty moving pictures, anything with a hollow plot, anything with a clich√© moral, anything with solid acting is immediately labeled as brilliant. They're also years behind the times. When a truly original movie is first released, they almost always trash it, then, half a lifetime later finally give it the credit it deserves. This cycle never breaks. If critics were politicians, their first priority would be how pretty America looks in the eyes of the world while ignoring the core issues. So when you see two middle-aged men come on TV and proclaim their critics, then further proclaim that Peeping Tom is an exciting, original, daring film, it's historically proved that there is a good chance they used to hate it. But if they were wrong then, what makes you think they are right now? Critics are a spineless paradox within a spineless paradox. I can't even take them seriously anymore. However, it seems that their influence is the reason Peeping Tom is so well-received by today's audiences. Here is why they're wrong. Again.Think about how many times have you've heard this plot A man is obsessed with studying a certain aspect of human psychology, thus he kills unsuspecting women to further his studies. He is psychologically unstable himself, and the story arcs into a person-vs.-self as he faces his own demons. Then, without spoiling anything, insert the most predictable/clich√© solution to this problem at the generic climax. Suicide. Who would have guessed? I could list a lot of '40s novels that repeated that tired formula, as well as quite a few '50s movies. There is nothing, not a single thing, about Peeping Tom that is even a mildly original idea. Not only that, but even the execution of the film is a copy/paste rip-off of Hitchcock and some Italian directors such as Dario Argento. It's a generic serial killer movie, with some minor Giallo influence. Maybe this just sounds like pretentious film buff jargon, but what I mean to say is Peeping Tom is a generic serial killer movie with pseudo-originality. I give it some minor credit for not being as clich√© as it could have been, but, really, who cares? If you've seen one movie like this, you've seen them all.The other glaring problem Peeping Tom has is the overt lack of any entertainment value whatsoever. The plot plays out predictably, and if you don't know everything that is going to happen after the first 5 minutes, I feel sorry for your lack of intelligence. The plot just chugs along with predictable plot point after predictable plot point, with absolutely nothing interesting happening whatsoever. There is even a hilarious love interest convention added in. It's reminiscent of the absurd romance between King Kong and Ann Darrow. The main difference is, here, the love subplot is just thrown in to move along the predictable plot to get to the predictable ending. Without the love subplot, there would be no reason for the killer to face his demons, and without that there would be no clich√© storyline&#151;and how could we live without that? This eventually leads to the unintentional laugh-out-loud scene where the killer says, Don't look afraid! If you don't, I won't kill you! I'm sorry, but that has to be THE single most melodramatic line in cinema history. I don't care how pseudo-creative the idea of a man killing to examine fear is, it's absolutely stupid. I would call Peeping Tom a comedy if it weren't so painfully boring.And, my God, it's boring. The director simply could not think of a more boring way to flesh out this boring plot. Most of the screen time is devoted to a mild-mannered killer staring at his films with an oh-so-dramatic look on his face. The build up for kills almost always lasts close to 15 minutes of pure dead-time where the women do some of the stupidest things imaginable. One of them even dances. It was so embarrassingly stupid I could hardly even look at the screen. In another scene, police stand around and make bad jokes over a dead body until one of them melodramatically says, with pure '30s cheese flair, Let's not forget there's still a maniac on the loose! Really, could the logic in this movie possibly get more stupid? It acts as if every human being has the intelligence level of a cartoon character. And yet we complain Napoleon Dynamite is stupid, but this is fine cinema?Overall, Peeping Tom is a waste of your time. If serial killers entertain you, go watch an episode of CSI. You'll get the same exact plot as you get here, but with infinitely more entertainment value and intelligence. Either way, I really just would like to know how many times the serial killer plot can be repeated, rehashed, remade, repeated, repeated, repeated until people finally get sick of it. In other words Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the other side.Did you laugh at that? I'm pretty sure you didn't. Why didn't you laugh at that? Because that joke has been repeated so many times it lost all humorous value to us. It's been repeated so many times, a lot of us don't even understand how it's a joke anymore. Peeping Tom is no different. By the year 1960, people had heard the plot so many times they didn't care anymore. By 2009, I don't even know why this movie is still even known, while much more original and intelligent movies are tossed aside as trash.0/10 "},{"Title":"Hitchcock Rip-off","Date":"1 October 2005","Score":"7 out of 27 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Thriller","Review":" This film was released the same year as Psycho and is very similar to Rear Window. This guy was just ripping off Hitchcock's ideas. There is even a cameo of a Hichcock look alike. What a cheap shot. If this movie is such a masterpiece why was it scrapped for decades? Lots of bad movies are revered as cult classics. This film was forgotten because it is terrible. The lead character is supposed to be English but he has a German accent. The plot is unengaging. Powell repeatedly uses the same shots. Like the nude shots of the pin up girls in the tobacco shop. His other movies like Black Narcissus and the Red Shoes can't be compared to this one. I think he was past his prime, he had to copycat Hitchcock's work, and he was washed up anyway. "},{"Title":"Goof in opening sequence (just like Hallowe'en)","Date":"16 May 2005","Score":"0 out of 16 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Thriller","Review":" The biggest goof of the film is the manner in which the first murder is filmed. When Mark Lewis hides the camera under his coat and then switches it on, the camera is at chest height. But when we cut to the point of view of the camera, it is evidently at head height. A similar gaff marks the opening sequence in Hallowe'en when Michael Myers runs amok with the kitchen knife; he is a six year old boy but the camera's height (his p.o.v.) is that of an adult. That is all that I need to say about the film in terms of goofs. And what I am typing now is merely an attempt to fill out the required 10 lines to fix the problem. I know it is necessary (personally I can not figure it out but it isn't my website so I shan't complain) so I will dully oblige by your request.

Furthermore, the acting is absolutely ridiculous, i could not imagine worse acting if i tried.  This movie is similar in badness to the version of Jack the ripper with Klausinski in it.  The english Psycho? FAR FROM IT! "}]
