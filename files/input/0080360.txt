I personally don't care if Chayevsky disowned the movie or if Russell resented him for it or how many angels you can set on the head of a pin, for that matter. Altered States is a harshly beautiful and intellectual movie based on a book with the same adjectives.I'm not going to praise the fine performances, the dazzling special effects, or the painful, emotional epiphany that the lead character, Eddie Jessup (William Hurt) experiences as he fights his way past the roadblock of pure intellect. I want to praise Altered States for its emotional and intellectual message of the power of love to embrace us all and heal our wounds.Altered States is not for the weak of stomach or the easily offended. The imagery is disturbing and, at times, repulsive. There are scenes of blasphemy that I know have put off Evangelical friends of mine. But the central idea of a commonality, a kinship that humans have with one another and the danger of setting oneself apart to avoid the pain of interacting and loving is, I believe, supremely satisfying at both an intellectual and emotional level.Altered States isn't one of the very best films I've seen, but it surely has been a source of joy for me. And if it doesn't turn your crank--or turns it the wrong way--then find your joy in another film or other media . . . and remember to love.

One of my all time favorites.And I'd like to point out that everyone is crazy about the much-touted and notoriously-expensive hallucination sequences, ... Of course if you've seen Russel's Tommy, some of the over-the-top sequences will look familiar and tinged with peculiar British-isms. And then there's the ending - well, it's controversial, that's for sure - anticlimax or not ? But for me the most electrifying parts are the ensemble cast acting. In the scene where Blair Brown is trying to cope with the trauma of the events in the isolation tank room, there's a very beautifully conceived long single shot through house windows. Russel needs credit especially for the argument between Balaban and Haid - some of the best acting I've ever seen - character actors hardly EVER get to put this kind of stage-acting energy on film. It stays with me still. They truly seem absolutely furious with each other, their lines overlap, it's absolutely convincing. Some of the greatest effects of this movie are simply good movie craft - when Jessup first sees the love of his life walk through the door, fantastically back-lit, and the music comes up and cross-fades into the next scene - it's breathtaking.It's the moments like that, and the very intro of the movie, with the slow title crawl, the deadpan lines read by Balaban, the first shots of Hurt in the tank, the eerie music ... This movie still stands out, still looks good,... and stands superior to other, more recent imaginings of internal hallucination become external.

Eddie Jessup is a scientist so introverted and afraid of human connections that it's not enough to abandon his family, he also has to further deprive himself of any and all stimulation, performing sensory depravation experiments on himself to attain better understanding of ultimate truth.  Jessup proclaims himself to be an atheist, but the visual content of his hallucinations reveals him to be a man who's more at war with God than a man who disbelieves.  His descent into a more primal state of being is an obvious metaphor for how easy it is for a man with commitment issues and fear of intimacy to turn completely inward, leaving the real world behind.  Some of what the character says early on about family and love make his motivations clear... Jessup is a man shattered by his father's death and unable to accept the vulnerability of the human condition.  A viewer has to really work to absorb and enjoy these metaphors, though, as Russell never slows his onslaught of special effects.  The movie also suffers from smart but unrealistic dialogue and ham-fisted performances from some of the principle characters (watch Blair Brown's over-the-top breakdowns in the last act). Altered States isn't the total package, it doesn't combine the visceral and the philosophical as well as movies like Jacob's Ladder or Natural Born Killers.  But it's better than most of today's equivalent movies (Donnie Darko, etc) that want to stimulate and provoke the viewer and don't quite pull it off.

The acting is also first-rate if largely overwhelmed by Russel's direction and the screenplay by Paddy Chayefsky.The only minor complaint I have is the transformation sequence.

It contains everything that is good about Russell, that is, his crazy imagery, and none of the bad stuff. That is, it's not an enormous bore. The script was written by Paddy Chayefsky, based on his own novel. Not the writer you would associate with horror or sci-fi, which is the proper genres to which Altered States belongs. He disowned the film before he even saw a cut of it, despite the fact that Russell was contractually obligated not to change a word of the script. The greatest asset of the film is the fantastic acting. William Hurt makes his screen debut as a mad scientist, a Harvard professor, actually, who is experimenting with sensory deprivation, mixed with some choice hallucinogens. He hopes to lose his modern mind in the sensory deprivation tank and regress to a primitive state. Unfortunately, some mushrooms that he finds in Mexico help him regress not only mentally, but physiologically. Blair Brown plays his estranged and worried wife, and Charles Haid and Bob Balaban (love the Balaban!) play colleagues who help Hurt do his experiments. The plot is silly, but it's legitimately eerie and frightening, thanks to Russell's surprisingly excellent direction. The film ends up in territory very reminiscent of 2001 A Space Odyssey, but I thought it all worked pretty well.

As such Eddie is driven to find what he thinks is the true meaning of life.First he does so by using a water tank formerly used for sleep studies, but when the ultimate truth still eludes him, he seeks out and tries a drug used by Indians to elicit their first memories.

But his friends are still skeptical, while his wife (played by beautiful Blair Brown) is becoming terrified that Eddie really did regress hi body back to some primitive form.To prove that he is telling the truth, Eddie tries for one more experiment that starts slowly but suddenly takes a unique turn as Jessup's body regresses way too far back. I won't spoil the ending, but it is far more stunning than anything even Kubrick could do. But I will say for some of those that don't quite know what's going on, Eddie has discovered the power of the mind and it is through that power-- call it psychokinesis-- that he destroys the laboratory with and maybe even regresses himself back to his beginnings. Eddie discovers the Ultimate Truth and it nearly destroys him.

Unfortunately from there it becomes less of a train of thought and more a train wreck. The film starts out with a brilliant but decidedly narcissistic scientist seeking to explore the boundaries between conscious and unconscious and finding what lay beyond the boundary. Would it lead him to a deeper understanding of himself and the human race and our oneness with the universe? Well, apparently not. Basically it led him into a decidedly over-the-top, melodramatic Jekyll-and-Hyde type scenario involving his 'devolving' into more and more primitive states of being. The film took an extremely interesting premise and, instead of following it to a thoughtful conclusion, twisted it into a third-rate horror film. The crowning turd in this punch bowl was Blair Brown's overly dramatic performance. From the moment she meets the protagonist she goes from being an in-control, competent woman to a hapless damsel in distress, complete with incoherent overly-sentimental babbling, fainting and flailing about.

I could go on and on about the archetypal symbolism that Director Ken Russell used as well, but these paradigms and icons of American culture, and some of it's darker elements seem all too familiar as we share Dr. Jessup's descent into madness.

I don't know much about Blair Brown, but she's also good as are the two main supporting actors, Bob Balaban, best known for his comic roles ('Best In Show', 'Deconstructing Harry', 'Seinfeld',etc.) and Charles Haid, usually remembered  as Renko in TV's 'Hill Street Blues'. You'll also spot soap star Thaao Penghlis as a Mexican professor, and a pre-'E.T' Drew Barrymore, as Hurt's daughter.

It's like trying to articulate the very nature of life itself.The dialogue within 'Altered States' is considerably admirable. There are a number of well articulated statements that aptly describe the psychedelic experience. For this alone, the film is worthwhile. I suppose this credit is due the Ken Chayefsky who wrote the book, which I have yet to read.While the majority of the film's posited notions about altered states of consciousness are both thoughtful and well-endowed, the notion that states of consciousness can externalize and physically manifest is borderline ridiculous. It is when Jessup first regresses into a primitive ape-like constitution that I began doubting the profundity of this film.The segment of the film where Jessup has regressed to a primitive ape-like creature is laughable, and has the same depth as a cross between Planet Of The Apes and Teen Wolf. Moreover, Jessup describes the creature as being a 4 foot bi-pedal ape-like human, but, after regressing, he is still quite tall, and the acting is completely ridiculous. Not to mention the segment is far too long.Some of the other trippy scenes are similarly ridiculous, and the special effects are quite laughable. However, they accurately translate the mood of the film into the viewer's experience. For that, it is exceptional. During the montages of the universe and the concepts of the beyond within / primordial unity, I think a zooming image of the Mandelbrot Set would have fit perfectly. Otherwise, they did quite well with it.The ending is cheesy, but, considering my experiences with psychedelics, it is quite apt. Coming out of my first mushroom experience, I truly felt the joy of living. During the experience I had profound insight into the nature of life, it was beautiful, but it was also extremely overwhelming. This led to immense anxiety, confusion, and terror. As I came out of the experience, I realized how beautiful life was and how I needed to stop searching for some ultimate truth, and needed to simply exist naturally and earnestly. When Jessup tells his wife that he has seen the nothing, and that's all it is, and that he didn't want to go there, because he was supposed to be here, I felt some familiar feelings flashback from that first mushroom experience.While the filmmakers do an exceptional job of expressing the negative aspects of the psychedelic experience - confusion, anxiety, terror etc...it does a poor job of expressing the brilliance, freedom, and beauty of the experience. I would have liked if the filmmakers had placed more attention on the fantastical brilliance of the psychedelic experience. Very few films accurately express this part of the psychedelic experience. Perhaps it is the human condition which tends us towards evil.Cinematographically, the film was alright. Again, I would have liked more positive vibes from the film. Some landscape shots (perhaps some more shots of the mountains in Mexico) and some blues and violets would have made this film a more pleasurable watch. The dystopic and hellish reds throughout the film made it quite unbearable. Not to mention the sudden shifts from slow cutting abstract minimalism (in the vein of 2001 A Space Odyssey) to extremely fast cutting neo realistic expressionism (in the vein of Dr. Caligari). These shifts were exhausting, and sudden like the shifts in a psychedelic experience, but they were over-exaggerated for effect. I would not like to watch this film with another person, to say the least.The lead actor made a fine performance, but I don't think he was the right choice for the part. Actors should resemble the characters, and the bold, masculine lead man did not fit the eccentricity's of the anxious mad scientist character. The one scene where he drunkenly boasts his visionary claims was exceptional, the rest of the film seemed like he was, well, acting.

In point of fact, Haid's Mason Parrish (the staid, symbol of reductionist science, named no doubt for builder of the church...and perhaps even May Soon Perish) is as much a hero in the film as is Hurt's Eddie Jessup (doubtless Eddie for eddy and Jessup for, perhaps, up from Jesus, in the Transhumanist sense). Poor Mason (who repeatedly saves Jessup's backside) must go down as one of the most unappreciated friends in film history.However, here I'm going to damn myself with my own edict by discussing the film Russell DIDN'T make, rather than the one he did.Far too much time in the film is spent troubling over the sexual iconography of the Eddie/Emily relationship. It's what chiefly dates the film, in all its Salvador Dali visual exploration.Beyond that, I have a special place in my heart for this film...yes, down to the silly apeman rampage scenes.

This is the only movie i would call a masterpiece. I highly recommend this for the spiritually involved. The film Contains to much substance to fully understand and relate to it after one watching. In my favorite scene The main character (Eddie)takes hallucanagetic mushrooms and tumbles out into the open desert night and he lies down to see his lover holding her torso up with her hands and her legs straight along the ground. Slowly the wind makes the sand from the desert cover the two up and after they are fully covered the figures disintegrate away from the wind until the sand is flat. This scene makes you feel impermanent and disconnected from your body. It was almost the feeling of a good meditation.

I feel that in the context of this movie, it is irrelevant. I plan on reading the book, see what the author actually meant. It is not a horror story, either, although it is frightening at places; certainly not a monster and gore film.Bottom line the realization is great, the feel is awesome, the story highly intellectual.

That is what happened to Nash, the subject of the dreadful Ron Howard limp retelling of that man's life. That idea could serve here, with us traveling with Hurt's character.

The film was allegedly passed on by twenty seven directors before Ken Russell eventually took the chair; and while the subject material is undoubtedly meaty, it's not really surprising that so many did pass it up as this film doesn't follow a usual progression by any stretch of the imagination and there were certainly many chances for it all to go wrong. Russell accepts the challenge with relish, however, and despite a few problems; this is still an interesting and well made film. The plot focuses on a scientific experiment at Harvard University. Professor Eddie Jessup has begun experimenting on himself by taking a hallucinogenic drug inside an isolation chamber. He begins to believe that the drug is allowing him to see an alternate state of conscious, but as the experiments go on; it soon becomes clear that they are having an effect on both his body and mind.The thing I'll no doubt remember for the longest about this film is the special effects; and while they are undoubtedly dated, they're still pretty special. Once the film reaches the final third, Russell really goes overboard with the visuals and they are interesting to say the least! It has to be said that the film is rather slow at first and it does take a while to really get going; but at least the build up isn't boring and it does give us a chance to get to know the characters. The central character is a little unlikely it has to be said but this can at least be partly explained away by his extended drug use and obsession with his work. The dialogues are generally a bit trite too, and the delivery is not always great. However, all this is offset by the plot line which remains interesting throughout. I get the impression that the writer intended the story to have some depth and pose some questions; but it didn't really, or at least not for me. Anyway, all in all this film is certainly worth a look and comes recommended.

I really can't come up with a good way to describe it other than you may find yourself screaming out loud at parts.  The story is like nothing I've seen before and the only ball park similarity I can come up with is Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde simply because of the metamorphosis Dr. Jessup goes through during the course of the film.  That comparison doesn't even do it justice because the scientific theories and jargon will have you spinning in circles trying to keep up with it.  Just sit back and enjoy the ride.  You can also enjoy the special effects, somewhat primitive but stellar for 1980.  Dick Smith has also outdone himself on the make-up effects.

The main idea is that our minds, deprived of sensory reality and under influence of mind-freeing drug, can tap into genetically inherited memories all the way back to the first of our species. The presentation was pretty solid with William Hurt as the genius/mad scientist falling deeper and deeper into his controversial experiments. Soon his ideas begin to seriously affect his reality. The film remains very good up until William Hurt turns into some kind of ape man. I suppose the idea behind it is that our minds can be capable of changing physical reality once full potential has been unlocked...However, I still think the presentation could have been better as the movie declines into a straight-up horror flick. It seems the writers didn't know what to do with their very interesting situation, so they pulled a standard Hollywood love conquers all ending, which, in my opinion, is pretty damn lame.However, this film still deserves much praise for its novel and intriguing ideas. The direction and production design are well done. The visual scenes are spectacular (for the late 70s), and William Hurt is excellent as main character Jessup. The movies main faults lie in the lame ending, which was rather muddled and unclear. Another sketchy area was the bad acting of the main actress, Blair Brown, I think she was chosen for her body rather than her acting ability.FINAL RATING 8/10 - I love the premise of the movie, so I give it a high rating despite the bungled ending.

This bizarre yet intriguing sci-fi offering comes from Ken Russell, a genre filmmaker who's made a handful of weak films, including The Lair of the White Worm (1988) and Gothic (1986). The script comes from Paddy Chayefsky, who also wrote the book upon which the film is based. Though Chayefsky disowned the film and Russell's direction, it remains among the best films in both they're careers. The best thing about the film is easily the script, which is intelligent and thought-provoking. Russell's direction is quite good as well; the editing on this film is truly top-notch. The actors gave great performances, especially a very young-looking William Hurt as the lead. In my opinion, Blair Brown's performance was at times a little uneven, but that never hurt the movie. The make-up effects, from Dick Smith, were terrific. The imagery&#151;including visions of hell, a seven-eyed goat-man (how cool is that?), hideously mutated human bodies and a truly trippy vision of the creation of life&#151;are startling. There's some decent gore too, included a nasty gutted lizard (which looks suspiciously realistic if you ask me&#133;) and other goodies I won't spoil for you. Also worth mentioning is a great score from John Corigliano, which is unsettling and very suspenseful. This film is NOT for everyone&#151;some viewers might be lost by the scientific aspects of the film and the hallucinogenic scenes. If you like everything explained to you and you're afraid of a little ambiguity, this isn't for you. If you want a different, intelligent sci-fi film&#133;see this.7/10.Just one complaint though&#151;I'm no scientist, but wouldn't it be impossible for a human being to survive the physical and metabolic changes of a transformation like the one seen in the film?

It is a winner by this alone, Russel's trademark. But its idea and concept are really sophisticated and interesting as well, especially if you take interest on different ways of perception of reality, esoteric procedures, meditation or simply the inner nature of human being. I have seen other great films by Ken Russel, each one a winner in its own domain. Russel is a great director. This film, and this is quite a subjective point-of-view, focuses in individual's struggle, even obsession with archegonal memories, universal consciousness and technics that expand consciousness. It's obvious that people interested in the psychedelic experience will find much in this. Up to a point, I conceived the film like a comment on those who lost their track, who placed so much of enthusiasm on the effort of expanding their brains, that lost most of their braincells, if you get what I mean. Above all, this important movie is one of the few films that follows the struggle of man against odds, against surroundings to become a more advanced and conscious being, perhaps to become god .The film could be a lesson for psychedelic-freaks, and i am not talking about ignorant fashion victims, psy-trance party-animals. FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS also deals with a similar topic but for some reason it is often falsely regarded as a PRO-psychedelics film by pot-heads and other drug-freaks.

Recently, I finally saw this film from 1980.Altered States is significant for a number of reasons it was William Hurt's first movie; it was writer Paddy Chayefksy's last movie; and it was, arguably, Ken Russell's first attempt at fantasy. Of the three aspects, I was happy to see Hurt in his first role. Beyond that, the story and film are less than I expected from such a director.With more than a nod to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and Robert Louis Stevenson's Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, the story concerns a behavioral scientist and academic, Eddie (Hurt), who, while testing mind altering drugs, appears to regress for a while to an ancient, primitive, human-like state &#x96; not just mentally, but also physically. What's Eddie really looking for? True love.Along the way to that goal, he marries an associate, Emily (Blair Brown) who is unable to actually live with Eddie, being occupied with her own scientific endeavors in the animal world. What's Emily really looking for? Security with a husband.Mix that together with a lot of psychological mumbo-jumbo, deep water-immersion sequences, whiz-bang special visual effects bound to please some viewers, and much screaming between scientists at times, this viewer was left, at the end, with a singular response so what? Others, no doubt, will find deeper interpretations.In sum, this film is one for die-hard Russell fans. It's well produced and acted, for sure, but it's just plain silly, like many fantasies.

This makes 'Altered Sates' probably one of his most bipolar films - and not necessarily in a good way. This disparity is between good and bad, not psychologically. Or, in this case, between sublimely, '2001 - A Space Odyssey' brilliant and absolute turgid tosh.I'm sure there's deep, philosophical meaning here and many an intellect can find much to peruse and value. But, to get there, you'd surely have to digger deeper and lower than even the depths that some of these overblown brain blow-outs plunge to. When William Hurt turns into an ape on the rampage, my concentration, interest and credibility ran out.Mr Russell, is/was undoubtedly a genius, his best films outshining anything else similar. But, that's the enigma, neither Ken, nor most of his films HAD a similar, let alone an equal. I'm certain that if Ken was still around to make this film today, the absurd and almost unwatchable effects, such as the body morphing, would be made to a standard that we now expect and wouldn't leave us squirming with disbelief at how bad this sort of thing looks here.Sure, this is 1980 and for then, these SFX would have been undoubtedly amazing and ground-breaking. But, yet again, that's the enigma of the whole thing - the brilliant Paddy Chayevsky with his original story and screenplay and Ken's super-fertile imagination were way beyond their time. And, as such, works, but also, doesn't.Is it worth buying? I bought a Korean import DVD (they exist, if you look) and are cheaper and once the defaulting Korean subtitles are disabled, looks like how I'm sure the normal version does.

What is happening to him, and does he dare to continue with this work ?Everybody should have at least one stoned-out movie they like. For most people it's Easy Rider or Head or The Cool And The Crazy, but for me it's the much more disturbing and visually dynamic Altered States. I think the reason for this is that the trippy effects in this film are terrific and an integral part of the plot, as opposed to just the usual psychedelic rubbish prevalent in some late sixties flicks. Russell's set-piece montages of disturbing horror and sexual/religious iconography are familiar from earlier movies like Tommy and Lisztomania, but the opticals and visual effects make-up by Brian Ferren, Dick Smith, Robert Blalack and Jamie Shourt are astonishingly eye-popping, rendered all the more unsettling by an ominous, growling score by John Corigliano. I guess Russell's style isn't to everybody's taste, but if you're willing to go with it I think he's one of the most visually and thematically exciting directors there has ever been (my favourite of his films is the goofy low-budget vampire flick The Lair Of The White Worm). All the more amazing in this movie is, despite the crazy story and the wild imagery, the whole thing works well as a drama of obsession and redemption. This is largely because of the fearless cast, who hurl themselves into character with terrific abandon. They're crazy people, but crucially they are believable crazy people. They yell at each other in complicated anthropological lingo about stellar conceptual notions, but in a way that brings the story to life, with many touching scenes, like the one where Hurt tells the story of his father's death, the genesis of his quest for truth amongst the infinite. All four leads are excellent (it was Hurt's first film), and Puerto Rican dancer Godreau gives a great physical performance as the simian alter-ego of Hurt's primal urges. Look fast for Drew Barrymore in her movie debut, aged five. Based on a book by Paddy Chayefsky (Marty, Network), who wrote the script but is billed here as Sidney Aaron (his real forenames) after falling out with Russell. This is a tremendous horror / science-fiction / drama which - whether you like it or not - you won't forget in a hurry.

The results of his experiments are more than he could have hoped for. Before long he starts hallucinating during the hours out of the experiments and during brief periods of time after the experiments he is transformed to these earlier versions of humankind, even all the way back to the primordial ooze.Unfortunately this side of the story enters the movie too late. The first 45 minutes we are watching Jessup rant and rave about religion and philosophy like there is no tomorrow, but unfortunately this is not as compelling as the second part of the story. When Jessup goes into one of his first hallucinatory states, the viewer is bombarded with a visual and sound explosion. The visuals are of such a level that they can be explained in any number of ways, which hinders the movie. Some scenes just take way too long (sandfigures withering away).The acting is decent. Hurt delivers a potent performance of the man who undergoes all these experiments. His convincing portrayal is what upholds the movie. His wife Emily (Blair Brown) must love him very much, because she endures Hurt's atrocious personality to the end in the name of love. The sceptic Mason (Charles Haid) was just too much, he resisted the experiments with such fervor that it became laughable and certainly not believable, his performance would have benefited from a more subtle approach.When I said that the story about halfway turns for the good, I didn't mean that it ended good as well. On the contrary, all the credit that was built with the change in story halfway was thrown away in the last fews minutes when the conclusion all becomes muddled and incomprehensible, and that was a shame.The special effects were nice enough to see, but not remarkable.

As such Eddie is driven to find what he thinks is the true meaning of life.First he does so by using a floatation tank formerly used for sleep studies, but when the ultimate truth still eludes him, he seeks out and tries a drug used by Indians to elicit their first memories. Still not getting the answers he seeks, Eddie begins to combine the two only to discover that some of his hallucinations are becoming all too real and are getting out of control.He is going beyond mass and energy, his body regressing to earlier physical states. At one point Eddie becomes an ape man is found wandering the Boston Zoo after one his trips. But his friends are still skeptical, while his wife (played by beautiful Blair Brown) is becoming terrified that Eddie really did regress hi body back to some primitive form.To prove that he is telling the truth, Eddie tries for one more experiment that starts slowly but suddenly takes a unique turn as Jessup's body regresses way too far back. I won't spoil the ending, but it is far more stunning than anything even Kubrick could do. But I will say for some of those that don't quite know what's going on, Eddie has discovered the power of the mind and it is through that power-- call it psychokinesis-- that he destroys the laboratory with and maybe even regresses himself back to his beginnings. Eddie discovers the Ultimate Truth and it nearly destroys him. It is his thoughts and fears that damn him, yet it is also his will to live that ultimately saves him in the end; his will made flesh in one of the most mind-blowing endings ever made.I just love this movie!

(You hear that Warner Bros.?)The altering of one's DNA?  Ok some of the science is implausible but so what?  And once you get past all the egghead dialogue between the participants involved, you get a remarkably imaginative film. Ok there's no CGI here, kiddies.  It's all done the old fashioned way with optical backdrops and stage effects.  And I still think they hold up, even after 20 years or so.  It enhances and gives the whole thing an added otherworldly view, imo.The basic plot is this  William Hurt plays a researcher at Harvard who experiments with altered states of consciousness by spending large amounts of time in isolation chambers.  He hears of an obscure peyote like substance taken by an Indian tribe down in Mexico that is supposed to further enhance one's altered state and bring man back down to an earlier primitive level.When he gets down to Mexico and takes the drug, he experiences remarkable visions about himself and his estranged wife (Blair Brown) whereby they are lying in the sandstorm and their bodies are slowly being blown and eaten away by the sand.  It's a remarkable scene that still comes to my mind, long after the film ends.Hurt then gets the brilliant idea of taking the drug in combination with the isolation chamber because he believes both experiences will greatly enhance one another, so he convinces his reluctant colleagues (Bob Balaban & Charles Haid) to help him go through with this.  Hurt then lies in the isolation chamber with electrodes attached to his head and waits.  This is the scene you see of Hurt in all the film posters and lobby cards promoting this film.All kinds of lights flash, the pipes in the isolation chamber room bend and Hurt is reduced to an ape-like creature that escapes out of the lab and runs to a nearby zoo and kills a deer.  But that's not all.  Later on, he then starts to change into a futuristic creature that looks somewhat like the Belial creature in Frank Henenlotter's BASKET CASE (1982).  Even the floor of the isolation chamber room swirls as Blair Brown tries to save her husband from his experiment gone wrong. Well done.In fact, this has some of the best trippy optical effects since 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY, with all kinds of swirls and psychedelic shapes that pass through your vision.  It's too bad I missed this on the big screen back in 1980 because it's the kind of thing that really demands that you see it that way.  The Warner Bros. DVD uses a remarkably clean wide-screen source that has no noticeable damage and sounds great, considering the early Dolby technology used.  Extras include short bios for the cast and trailers for the film that aren't as clean as the film itself.  Too bad there's not more.

In a movie that not only stirs up but literally bathes in religious, cosmic, and psychedelic elements, scientific realism is an oxymoron. I would strongly suggest that people who enjoy this movie also see Serpent and the Rainbow, Flatliners, Brainstorm, and Wild Palms. All involve mind-altering experiments with religious connotations.The Jessup character begins by using sensory deprivation to drive probably drug-influenced hallucinagenic experiences up the psychic wall. Jessup's experiments move onto a group-hallucinatory experience with some native Mexicans over mushrooms. That this was foreshadowed to be a group hallucination seems to have been missed by every reviewer and from this point most reviews lose all relevance to the film. You have to keep in mind that if what the native told Jessup is true, then Jessup was not alone in the imagery of his Mexican trip. If you don't believe that the native knew what he was talking about, then you might as well excuse the rest of the movie as nothing but an internal psychotic episode being experienced by a man dreaming while suspended in the waters of a sensory deprivation tank. I mean, if you are going to excuse the experience, then just push the eject switch while the titles are rolling because that's the entire experience. That's all there is. Otherwise, accept some of what occurs as reality. If you accept it as reality, then you might as well ditch the entire hallucinatory theory because you can't have it both ways. Either the experience is a hallucination or it is real. Do you dig what I'm saying? That's the difference between criticising this film as art placed on a medium and criticising it as a human story. It's either one or the other. There's no in-between or mincing. You would have to have arrived at an irrational conclusion to assume you can criticise it sometimes one way and sometimes the other, because there is just one movie in question and not any more movies than that. It's one, single movie based on one, single assumption which is either hallucinatory or real.What Jessup experiences is the result not of substances or of environments but of his own mind. If you threw a steaming pottery-full of the Mexican mushroom mixture into the sensory-deprivation tank and hit puree, you still wouldn't get anything. Obviously the contagious element of the emergent experience, the active ingredient of the psychic phenomenon that doubles as real and hallucinatory is the human mind, Jessup's mind.The religious symbolism is fascinating to the character, not only the christian bibilical symbolism but also the ancient mysticism as well. I found influences from biblical Revelation peculiar, while the emission of perhaps primordial or divine light through solid substances and the instantaneous malleation of elements and cellular anatomy struck me as quite profound. The repeating spectre that replaces Jessup at several points late in the film is unnerving. That twisted entity's aggravation is experienced by the viewer who relates that there is very little such an entity's actions can achieve toward relieving anxiety.Nothing is missing from the film in terms of complete knowledge and understanding of fundamentals and extremes, especially in the realms of human behaviour and psychic externalism. Not once does the dramatic bow to the pretentious in this acting. I have to admit I allow myself one single artistic criticism; the first escaped regression scene featuring some acrobatics almost gave the movie a Broadway-to-film feeling. I can only imagine how a film like this would present itself on Broadway. Is that just hooting and screaming, or does the primate burst into song?And is that a banana in my pocket, or are some of the experiences of the character generously nice of the provider? What I wanted to know was why the movie didn't explore the potential of mixing the primitive regression with the sexual discovery, and why the comingling of this discovery with the regression was stalled until the more cosmic regression takes place? And at that point, why didn't the cosmically regressed Jessup attempt to consume his wife more thoroughly, perhaps through a black hole? Wouldn't she have been just as desireable to his more profound self? And that is probably the single impetus that drives the entire film the man just doesn't want the woman all that bad, until he realizes he might lose her essential manifestation to the external void.Something this movie lacked was manifestation of even earlier fundamental forces embodied in human conciousness. Obviously this is hinted at in the busting of the sleep-deprivation vessel by the light shining out of Jessup, and the visual allusion to some kind of galactic birth, but neither Eddie, Arthur, nor even Mason prove to be Adam. Otherwise, the mentioning of various disciplines of cosmic creation (including 'mumbo jumbo', which I personally adhere to,) makes up for the lack of serious attempts to visualize the human snake eating its tail.

It is stunning that a film with special effects this beautiful and fitting was made in 1980, but that wasn't why I kept watching it over and over.I tend to be incredibly critical of most Sci-Fi movies on technical grounds (spoiled by a physics degree and 5 years of philosophy graduate courses) so I was stunned by the tightness of this movie. Obviously it's fiction and at some point goes off the deep end scientifically, but like the best X-files episodes (but much better), it leaves you impressed by how well it justifies its leaps of fancy.Movie premise (not a spoiler)Jessup is a young hotshot professor at the Harvard Medical School in the early 70's. His original work focused on the neurological deformities among schizophrenics. Allegedly (and this IS true) only advanced schizophrenia is visible in the structure of the brain--early schizophrenia is not, though people who suffer from it still experience similar mental problems. His original research focused on explaining why this is the case (not featured in the movie; left implied). Apparently, there are no models to explain how the neurological deformity associated with schizophrenia is caused (maybe false, but not stupid) so Jessup starts taking seriously the idea that the MENTAL disorder considered to be early schizophrenia actually CAUSES the characteristic change in structure. This is a pretty wild conjecture, I agree. Remember though that most movies ask you to make much bigger leaps. What's classy about Altered States is that it correctly treats this as a wild conjecture and Jessup receives quite hard time from his colleagues for thinking something this flaky. In an attempt to discover the physical mechanism by which thoughts affect physical structure, Jessup begins experimenting  with altered states of consciousness in a sensory deprivation tank, later in conjunction with processed hallucinogens from the Amanita Muscaria mushroom. Well, it's no spoiler to say that he finds evidence for his theory that mental states can have an effect on morphological structure. By warping his mind enough, he undergoes several of these changes himself.Another somewhat questionable theory the viewer is asked to accept is the idea that memories can be written in DNA and inherited. This amounts to something like innate knowledge. Again, people believe crazier things, and this isn't too much of a stretch for fiction. It's certainly true that instincts are inherited and innate for example, babies remember how and when to suck (as do most recent movies of the Hollywood pedigree). Some research shows that fear of snakes may be innate, and if so, it must be encoded somewhere in our DNA. Well, according to the movie, some of these encoded memories are latent and not retrievable to the modern Homo Sapiens (no longer useful for our survival). However, some altered states of consciousness can cause us to conjure up these vestigial memories. Well, a little cooky for the New England Journal of Medicine, but too crazy to accept as a movie premise? Hardly!This is the first movie of its kind since 2001 where a savvy viewer doesn't have to slap her hand over her eyes and say come on, that is soo implausible!What's more, this solid science fiction premise is embedded in a script with excellent dialogue and three dimensional characters. William Hurt does an excellent job. I have to agree with other reviewers that the ending was a little cheesy, but it didn't bother me when I watched the movie. By the end the film generates so much good will you are able to forgive just about anything, and it's really not so bad.SPOILERS--stop reading here and rent/buy the masterpiece of a movie NOW if you still haven't! That's an order!In retrospect, I think the movie would have worked fine if Jessup didn't actually grow hair, shrink and blow up the tank with his transformation. Where did all that energy come from? His brain waves? I would have been happier if the transformation happened only on a cellular level (explanation what we think of as junk DNA is actually simian DNA and it suddenly becomes active through the effect of his thoughts, producing both simian proteins and neurotransmitters; brain begins working in a characteristically simian way, higher brain functions turn off, Jessup goes nuts...) Anyway, the movie only needed a tiny bit more tinkering before it became totally responsible scientifically. All the same, the scientist are portrayed realistically, not like the caricatures that most Hollywood movies draw of them. I wish this sort of movie would get made these days. Instead we have to live with the gaping plot/coherency holes in AI, the Matrix and worse! Altered States makes new Sci-Fi look like it was made by a bunch of know-nothing hacks.

Russell, like him or not, is a great visualist and, even if you think he's over-rated, there's no doubt that once you see one of his films, you'll never forget it.

Hurt does especially well, running through a gamut of emotions as Jessup, who starts to believe that there are some questions that shouldn't be asked.It's definitely a movie where you'll be debating with friends after seeing it; put the Creationists on one side and the Darwinists on the other and have at it.

What he discovers at first is the ability to relive with total clarity experiences of his childhood. As he continues these experiments, his visions become more acute and filled with religious illusions. Years go by and Jessup has become sedated with the trappings of academia, leaving him unfulfilled and longing for the good old days of experimentation and wonder.

What might he learn inside an isolation tank while being under the influence of this drug? Would he be able to peel away the layers of evolutionary time back to early man and beyond? Perhaps even back to the first thought? I think it's a classic example of the genre & demonstrates that as weird & unlikely as a plot might be it can still come across as convincing genuinely eerie if handled right i.e. good acting, good script, compelling story line & maybe some decent special FX. All to often these days the special FX seem to be put before everything else & as such films of this genre lack substance & usually don't amount to much outside of the box office. For me the special FX in this film still stand up & look good. The trip sequences are extremely surreal & somewhat disturbing in parts but there are some great sequences that definitely start to mess with your head! The only reason this movie still works today is because the movie makes clear that in some tribes, there are substances that are traditionally and successfully used in spiritual rituals, and it is one of these that Hurt uses, in combination with sensory deprivation techniques, to try to get in touch with his own genetic memory, for lack of a better term.Overall rating 8 out of 10.

Emily wants to stay together but Eddie is restless in his settled unimpressive academic life. He visits a Mexican native tribe and has an out-of-body experience. He returns to resume his sensory deprivation experiments with a new tank. The hallucinations are visually dynamite. This is held together by William Hurt. He has the leading man looks but also has a hidden sense of reserved madness. There is a nice steady devolution and memorable scenes of his metamorphosis.

It plies its trade on the senses as William Hurt's mad scientist takes to the isolation tank (on Mexican shrooms, no less) and the line between real and surreality continues to blur (cue the psychedelic effects). Trying to use mind-expansion to unlock other states of consciousness is where this movie peaks. But then Hurt actually regresses into a caveman and realizes his fall from banging Blair Brown to grunting and snacking on goats. What you hear right there is the sound of a trainwreck.

I'd liken it to a drug experience if only I'd ever taken drugs before, but the degree to which watching this film simulates what its characters go through is astounding. The story is rather simple a scientist, Eddie Jessup (William Hurt, in his feature film debut) has been doing sensory deprivation experiments, but after a trip to Mexico, he starts doing those experiments under the influence of a powerful psychedelic drug which might possibly be affecting his genetic makeup. Plot-wise, it's not too complicated as it just follows Eddie's personal journey and evolution over the course of these life-altering experiments. Every actor was very capable and William Hurt was especially good considering this was his first role. However, the real magic of the film is in its many hallucinatory images which range from the sacrilegious to the primal. Even if you haven't seen the film, you might already be familiar with the image of a six-eyed, goat-headed man on a cross. Early on, Eddie mentions that he had visions as a young man that were out of Revelation and this imagery is kind of a perversion of that. However, the imagery that occurs later on in the film is extremely hard to describe and honestly it's best if you just see it for yourself. There are some interesting observations/connections made between religious and psychedelic experiences, and also mental disorders, however the true power of this film is in its images, which were realized with some incredible visual effects. I don't think this film will be to everyone's taste, certainly not those who are religious and might be offended by some of the imagery, but for those brave enough to give it a try it's an experience you won't soon forget.

However, Jessup finds himself teetering on the brink of madness after he regresses to a dangerous primitive state. Although director Ken Russell brings his trademark wild'n'trippy sensibility and flair for bold and alarming mind-roasting imagery to Paddy Chayefsky's smart and provocative script, he fortunately manages for the most part to keep his more self-indulgent impulses under control and grounds the fantastic premise in a plausible everyday reality. Moreover, the story not only acquires extra substance and resonance from its key themes about science, religion, the meaning of life, and the origins of man, but also has a surprising additional poignancy thanks to the touching central love story between Eddie and his concerned wife Emily (a winningly sharp and spunky portrayal by Blair Brown). The ace acting by the superior cast keeps this picture on track Hurt and Brown do sterling work in the leads, with sturdy support from Bob Balaban as bookish and loyal colleague Arthur Rosenberg, Charles Haid as the huffy and disapproving Mason Parrish, and Miguel Godreau as a crazed caveman. Jordan Cronenweth's striking cinematography offers a wealth of breathtaking outré visuals. Kudos are also in order for Dick Smith's remarkable make-up, the dazzling special effects, and John Corigliano's moody'n'melodic score. A truly unique and fascinating film.

But he does have a tendency to use excessive imagery, a lot of them not for the faint-hearted and can cause offense. Altered States doesn't quite stand out for me as one of his best, it is a most interesting film though and it is difficult to stop watching it. It's not perfect, the ending is rather muddled, Blair Brown is beautiful with a to-die-for body but gives a ham-fisted performance(especially in her painfully overwrought meltdown) and the Neanderthal man sequence is on the eccentric side. Altered States is a great-looking film too, the special effects are awesome and hold up well today and the imagery has an eerie hypnotic quality, there is some excess here but much less distasteful than in other Russell works(ie. Lisztomania, Dance of the Seven Veils). The photography and set design are similarly terrific. The music score is haunting while not obvious with the odd quirky and tender touches too. The dialogue is smart and thoughtful, there are some witty lines that are wonderfully strange and laugh-out-loud funny, considering the type of film and that it's Russell it works. Admittedly narratively it is very, very weird, but Altered States is rich in atmosphere and the atmosphere here is one of the best things about the film. The foreboding parts are eerie, the surreal hallucinogenic parts are mind-bendingly hypnotic, the campier parts bring amusement that doesn't overbear things, the horror parts are appropriately ominous and the fantasy parts have the right amount of imagination. There's also a tender pang to Altered States' story too. Altered States has Russell's style all over it and it packs a bulls-eye but while not as restrained as his early work with Elgar and Delius biographies and Women in Love Russell embraces the camp but reigns in as well, as confusing as that sounds. The transformation sequence is silly but also disturbingly surreal and visually stunning. In terms of performances, Brown is the only blemish. The best performer and possibly the highlight of the film is William Hurt, whose outstanding performance ranks along his best. Charles Haig is very funny and not too hammy. Overall, not for everyone or the faint-hearted but especially for the atmosphere and Hurt Altered States is not just interesting but also a good film on the most part. 7/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"So much potential","Date":"28 October 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":" This might be the most frustrating movie I've ever seen.

I've heard that someone wanted the great Andrei Tarkovsky to direct, but even he couldn't work with that, and this is coming from an obsessive Tarkovsky fan.And even if Jessup's search for spiritual awakening was doomed to fail, it didn't have to end the hollow, love power way it did.All in all, I highly recommend the film, but it's for me a very depressing 100-odd minutes.

He Revels in Prickly Scenarios and Blasphemy (especially Religious). But any Blasphemy will do because it is Provocative.In this Film the concept of finding The Truth through the use of Sensory Deprivation Tanks and a Dose of Magic Mushrooms is nothing really more Deep for Russell or the Audience then some sort of Entertaining Experimentation. Audiences hardly ever have a Good Time at a Ken Russell Film, but here there is more to have Fun with than most.There is an Extraordinary amount of Crackling Imagery and Scintillating Sound all Wrapped around an Academic Rap. None of it means much and is there as sort of Guide Rails to hold on too while the Movie takes its Roller Coaster Ride into the Subconscious by way of Genetic Imprints, and then Deconstructs the Primal Scream of the Birth of Man.This is only Deep if you let it and most likely that was not the intent of the Director.

As such, it looks pretty dry and boring at first glance, but the actual subject of the experiment is something of fascination that prompts further study. Altered States presents the idea that powerful drugs can create a conduit for a person to touch the inner self (and possibly touching God at the same time), allowing one access to six billion years of genetic memories stored in the human body. As the main character continuously dabbles with the forbidden fruit of mind-altering substances, he comes closer and closer to inhabiting the body of the world's first primordial human being, complete with raw primal instincts and unbridled physical power.The concept is really high-level stuff, provoking lots of introspect into the human spirit, human evolution, and humanity's relationship with spirituality and religion. Above all, the film is most memorable for being visually insane. There are several sequences where the film bombards you with rapid-fire freak-out imagery. I've yet to see any other film where the screen flashes weird goat heads, bloody knives, hellish scenes of crucifixions and boiling hot magma, giant snakes, sex, the universe, and lord knows what else all at once. Scenes like this make the film very pungent, and it stands out as one of the trippiest experiences on film.In between the occasional freak-outs, the film slows down quite a bit. The film goes on to follow these scientist characters, who form some profound relationships and rivalries, but most of these scenes come off as rather plain and dry, especially when compared to the film's most vivid imagery. I couldn't tell you if such contrast is intentional or not. Regardless, it is an intriguing story with a cast of halfway decent characters.The film has its share of extremely hard-hitting imagery and extremely plain photography. Editing can be pretty erratic during the freak-out scenes, but for intentional effect; the film is very successful at beating its trippiness over your head. Acting is decent William Hurt is especially noteworthy. Writing is quite sophisticated, but could potentially go over some viewers' heads. This production has okay-looking sets, props, and costumes, and the special effects are impressive for its time. Music is alright.Overall, this is a movie for the left side of the brain. If that interests you, then the film is certainly recommended. Otherwise, you might still want to see it for some of the trippiest (and possibly scariest) images ever committed to celluloid.4/5 (Entertainment Average | Story Very Good | Film Good) "},{"Title":"A love story at heart...","Date":"8 September 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":" When I saw Altered States back in early 1981 I was only 13 years old. I dug the movie because of its outstanding effects sequences and its horror laden themes. It never occurred to me at the time that I was watching, in essence, a love film disguised as an FX psycho drama. Dr. Jessup (William Hurt's big screen debut) is a scientist obsessed with finding the ultimate truth about life and what makes us human beings. He and his fellow scientist friend, Arthur (Bob Balaban) conduct experiments in an isolation tank, where Jessup floats in water with electrodes connected to his head. He wishes to explore his consciousness on anther level, so to speak. He meets and marries Emily, another fellow scientist who falls madly in love with him. Emily truly loves Jessup despite him not showing any signs of true affection or love towards her. 7 years pass by and Jessup and Emily now have 2 little girls and are on the brink of divorce, apparently on Jessup's insistence. Before they actually legally divorce, both scientists decide to take trips, separately that is. Emilt head off to Africa to study animals and Jessup heads to Mexico to explore and collect a drug used by some natives in spiritual rituals. When he comes back from Mexico, Jessup brings samples of this untested drug and decides to use it in the confines of a new isolation tank. He believes this drug taps into the most primal essence of the human being. It isn't long before stuff starts happening (like Jessup actually altering himself and turning into a primate!). Despite warnings from his colleagues to stop experimenting with this drug, Jessup soldiers on in his quest for that ultimate truth. Despite being close to divorce, it is only Emily who becomes convinced that Jessup is actually onto something new and fascinating, but also extraordinarily dangerous and life threatening and begs him to stop the experiments. Her motivation is pure and simple love, her love for him is a true and Jessup's love for his ultimate truth quest. Yet, whenever she tells him that he loves him, he answers with something else. Without spoiling anything, it is Emily's love that plays a crucial role in the film's outlandish ending. Watching the film last night for the first time on bluray I realized I was watching a twisted sci-fi love story. At the hands of late maestro Ken Russell it was hard to imagine Altered States as a regular Hollywood feature. As with other Russell films (The Devils, Crimes Of Passion), there's a heavy religious allegory during Jessup's trips with the drug, with some stunningly bizarre visuals rarely seen even in today's films. This is NOT a regular Hollywood film, despite being done there. Without Ken Russell's guidance this would have been a tepid horror fest.You'll do no wrong in Checking Altered States, a movie that (to me at least) has stood the test of time and looks very little dated.

Just a few words you might say after seeing Altered States. But that's just the tip of the iceberg, because AS is a hell of a trip. Much of the sci-fi from the 60's and 70's was very 'drug influenced.' In the greatest sci-films of that time, it is very visible (2001 A Space Odyssey). Altered States is no different, and maybe that is what makes it so good. It is a psychedelic trip turned into a physiological experience. The concept is both amazing and ridiculous. I mean, how plausible is this concept -- munching on a few shrooms and getting into a deprivation tank can open up a rift in space time, causing you to digress to a primordial self. But at the same time, this physio-psychological exploration is fascinating and it's amazing to see such ideas in a Hollywood film. The thing is, everything is done so right that whether the concept sounds cool or silly to you, it doesn't matter. It comes off believable and thrilling and thought-provoking and scary, all at the same time. Hurt also gives a great performance as the obsessed professor looking for God. This is sci-fi done right.

A book that comes close to the issues raised by this very interesting (and certainly underrated) film is 'The Dragons of Eden' by Carl Sagan. Ken Russell's direction shows Jessup in several stages in his private life with his girlfriend and then wife Emily (Blair Brown) and the uncompromised and determined side of the scientist Jessup working long hours on weekends with sensory-deprivation experiments to prove that dormant conscious may be present to us humans after all but one needs to achieve the appropriate 'laboratory' conditions to study 'it' properly.Hurt is excellent in his portrayal of the determined professor who discovers more than he initially expected. His motives to search for hidden meanings in the human existence and the inevitable reality of death may not be so well explained but the trip certainly provides some answers. A very good film.

William Hurt (in, i believe, his debut film performance - though it's a performance so nuanced you would scarcely credit that) became a favourite actor of mine due to his characterisation of brilliant but emotionally detached scientist Eddie Jessup, dealing with childhood trauma and lapsed religion by conducting dangerous experiments in sensory deprivation to bring about altered states of consciousness and explore his inner self.Whereas most man into monster movies set up the lead character as a nice, stand-up guy to contrast with the beast he becomes (such as Larry Talbot in The Wolf Man and Henry Jekyll in almost any version of Jekyll & Hyde), Hurt gives us a complex, hard to like Eddie Jessup; a man who we can easily understand, but find it hard to empathise with. As Jessup grows more distant from his wife (the lovely Blair Brown, who i wish i'd seen in more things), and retreats into himself in a very literal fashion, things get very dangerous. A regression into a Neanderthal man leads to a zoo goat-based meal even more inadvisable than a drunken kebab, and Eddie from thereon in becomes more and more detached from humanity physically and psychically, as much as socially.An ending scene still redolent today, possibly more recognisable because A-Ha stole it for the oft-played Take On Me video, caps a film that - unbelievably described by another reviewer as pointless and plot less - explores love, faith, life, death and what it means to be human. This is a film about everything, not nothing, and Eddie's journey from detached savant to primordial ape to weird energy thing, and finally to fully rounded human being is one that i highly recommend everyone goes along on.

What follows is very reckless conversation about the causes and raison d'être of schizophrenia and Cronenberg-esquire sex scene accompanied by an ominous score by John Corigliano. Essentially, the film follows William Hurt who gets stoned inside a giant boiler and the various horrific hallucinations he has about his life. The dialogue is very Chayefsky with a whole load of Christo-religious references thrown in and mostly self-satisfied overblown expositionary wankery that would later by parodied and mocked in Arcand's The Decline of the West. Anyway, the film deals with past memories being biologically passed on with each generation and Hurt attempts to activate past memories he feels are hidden in his limbic brain by visiting some tribe on a mountain and bleeding in their stew. Hurt brings the stew back with him to New York where the effects of the hallucinations become more intense and Hurt arrives closer to his goal in unlocking past memories. When Hurt hallucinates I start contemplating how Chayefsky would have written this in the novel Altered States in based on... I can only imagine it would be like WHOA, DUST STARTS BLOWING EVERYWHERE AND THERE'S LIKE THIS SHEEP WITH A HEAD OF A GOAT WITH LIKE HEAPS OF EYES AND THEN THERE'S THIS LIZARD ON A DUDE'S HAND AND OUT OF NOWHERE, BLAIR BROWN'S T-TS APPEAR. Anyway things start to get creepy when Hurt insinuates his genetic structure is undergoing changes during his intense hallucinations hence the title of the film.

Yep, that's what the man said. Years after seeing Altered States for the first time, I started looking up terms that the bearded endocrinologist used while fussing out the clinical physician in the hallway at the Boston school where the two worked. Parrish clearly believes that Jessup is flaky because Jessup believes a fantastic scenario has taken place...not neurological. The robust medical scientist who is president of the Journal Club thinks that Jessup has had an ischemic attack, a type of seizure. Jessup is between tears of laughter and disbelief. William Hurt plays the physician taking what Parrish calls a metabolizing substance, but not LSD and not a serotonin antagonist. Later, Jessup's wife(Blair Brown) finally believes herself that her husband is endangering himself by tampering with his DNA, yet is unwilling to believe that Jessup is becoming a monster. She is an anthropologist. When she hears a tape her husband Eddie made of himself while in isolation, she starts to freak out. She becomes scared.What gives the movie character substance in a strangely humorous way is the interplay between the two scientists Parrish and Rosenberg. After the scene in the tank room, the two men are virtually paroxysmal, screaming at each other. Parrish has not mentally accepted that something has happened beyond his knowledge and the bounds of normal reality.Earlier, the doctor has called Jessup a flake when Jessup has requested a battery of tests be done on himself after earlier tank trip. Jessup has every idea he is undergoing a transition.

And, verdict, it does.Some folks no doubt will be put off by the pre-digital visual pyrotechnic barrage. The only way *that* could work would be if the narrative leads you to a place where you can metabolize the visuals in a satisfactory way. It worked for me! But--disclaimer--no guarantee it'll work for you.It's a great movie for the acting talent. Chayefsky wrote angry confrontation very, very well, and if you go for that you'll love the angry scenes, like the beautiful argument between Balaban and Haid, after the experiment where even they have to admit some likelihood that Hurt is on to something.Now that I think about it a second, there's something I have to say about Chayefsky. It's very, very rare for a screenwriter to write specialist language into a script and pull it off. Chayefsky does this in Network, The Hospital, and here in Altered States. How many times have you watched a movie where the actors say sh1t that pretty transparently communicates a bungled (if well-intentioned) attempt to have the actors sound authoritative? Man, that hurts! Chayefsky was a rare marvel in this regard; his technical writing is intelligent and seasoned with affect.So, yeah, yeah, some folks will shut the flick off when they see the light show. But if you listen carefully and do a little work to divine the intent of the characters, I think it holds together pretty well, light shows and all.

The one problem with the movie is that while the story line is strait forward enough, it's kind of shallow. It gets us to like the characters but we don't really grow into them. While Altered States may be a bit underdone on the pages, on the screen it is quite spectacular.

One day my girlfriend finally sat me down and made me watch it, if you pay attention you'll be surprised, she said. She was right.Altered States has nothing to do with the government. Sure there are some early references to it in the beginning of the film but they are dropped fairly early. This movie is a satirical look at the mind expansion though drugs movement of the late 1960's. A scientist, Eddie Jessup, played by William Hurt is attempting to push the boundaries of sensory deprivation and what it can do to the human mind. It's the late 70's and he's looked at some kind of over the hill quack by his contemporaries as most have moved beyond the LSD induced 60's to respected careers. But when he stumbles upon a mysterious combination of drugs and tank time he's swept to the dawn of humans. The line between dream experience and reality become blurred however as Jessup spends more and more time in the tank and eventually the wall comes crashing down. This is not a straight line narrative film. It jumps from time to time. The plot is secondary however, to the message the movie is trying to send. The human mind is a merely a collection of experiences and data, a bank if you will that has been storing information since monkeys first decided to stand on two legs. The information is so vast however that to compensate our mind locks most of it away to keep us sane but our most base instincts are still there, we just choose to satisfy them in a different way than our ancestors, today buying a huge TV with a nice sound system is the substitute for downing a huge antelope on the plains. The movie's main point though is what's the point? What could possibly be gained from this knowledge? That's where the farce comes in, this might be the first movie to poke fun at boomers. The big revelation of LSD induced hyper-awareness is a regression to our simian forms. Thanks for the hard work fellas. I'm neglecting the movie itself however. Technically it's quite an achievement for the time and the music, sound and cinematography really set the mood. I'm sure upon its release Altered States was taken seriously as art and a cautionary tale for science going too far but looking back its an enjoyable farce of the boomer generation and its obsession with the why? of the Universe.

While some have trashed it because of it's lack of scientific background, I fail to see how that really hurts an essentially fictional movie.  I've always considered the movie something of a creepy horror movie, simply because the subject matter is so disturbing. A fanatic scientist trying to uncover repressed memories of the origins of the universe seems scarier to me, than fascinating.  THis isn't a bad thing...just my interpretation of the events.  However, where Ken Russell makes his biggest mistake is in the assumption that one is familiar with the book.  Too much of the film is vague (especially he ending) when it's not put into the context of the book.  Supposedly, Paddy Chayefsky hated this movie, but I can't see why.  It's an incredibly accurate depiction of his novel...few movies-from-books keep such a level interpretation.  William Hurt's first performance is his best.  His manic style of acting never really seems to suit any of his other characters, but this one.  The newly remasted Dolby 5.1 soundtrack on the DVD release is a dramatic upgrade of the digital sound on the VHS, and quite impressive.  A lot of the special effects are extrememly impressive considering the lack of digital technology.  However, I urge any fans of this film to go out and research more about this kind of unusual science.  The links between mental regressions and the rejection of classical religious icons is a facinating subject.

I know this in the Buddhist context but there's a rich history spanning different practices that circles the same; that which gives rise to mind.Many of the most erudite makers have tried to see into this, from Tarkovsky to Weeresethakul recently. It always comes back to formative emptiness. The idea - observed in centuries of meditation - is to create stillness so the machinery of self outrun you and appear ahead. Here we get a few devices that probably had some leftover traction from Tim Leary's day, isolation tanks and hallucinogens the protagonist submits himself to; but these are devices that force what Buddhists and others have been achieving by direct meditation, stillness makes consciousness rise up in front of you. (drugs simply show the frayed elasticity of mind; there's no deeper reality in hallucination, that is just the shape mind takes when frayed in this way, amazing of itself)But it's in the wrong hands here. We get lots of rational pecking at the shell, all this energy wasted in discussions about the scientific possibility of the endeavor, yelling about the ethics. Visions are boxed separately, never truly hallucinated. We get simply dumb science as hard metaphor; mind actually transforms matter, ego as actual monster. By the end a lot has been reduced to a hairy ape running around.And the maker must have pushed all his life against repressive religion, building all this negative energy against the mere shell of spirituality; so his search for a visual god is dynamic but ugly, a hysteric pushing back.The only way to get something out of it is to groove on it as a modern Frankenstein; with the search for the original self as an excuse for malformed visions, hoary spectacle. The parting notion is wonderful love as bringing each other back.

This is a terrible and ridiculous movie, which bites off a lot more substance than it can chew, still for the most part it tackles interesting subjects in a fairly interesting way, and has some creative use of special effects and music. It's a mad scientist story, but it's one which makes you want the scientist to win, to finish his awful experiments and find the answers to everythings, kind of a 20th century Faust, with b-movie sci-fi treatment of a first rate speculative fiction masterpiece.

"},{"Title":"A fascinating and outlandish retelling of Dr Jekyll & Mr Hyde","Date":"7 April 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":" One of the best periods of film-making in the entire history of cinema occurred during the late 1970s and early 1980s. There were more great films released in that short period of time than anytime I can think of, aside from the late 1930s, early 1940s. It was a great time to go at movies because the films were cool, well made, explored challenging ideas, never looked down at their audience and were effing entertaining to boot. More than 20 years later now, looking back at that time, I can honestly say that nothing since then came close to recapturing that magical time of movie-going. And ALTERED STATES is one of those great films released back then. I don't know how many times I saw AS then but I recently bought the ultra-cheap DVD to check it out again for the first time in two decades, just to see if it still holds up. On the whole, it does. There are some parts of AS that were always weak and they still are today but they haven't diminished the impact of the film.As much as I love ALTERED STATES, there was always something about it that was missing which always bothered me and looking at it again, I now know what it is. The transition between Eddie Jessup before and after he takes the drug was always too brief and/or too sudden. The timeline in the story was already truncated by massive gaps, so when Eddie starts changing physically in a matter of a few scenes, I had a hard time accepting it back then and still today. A more gradual change between those states would have been more effective. But when you combined that problem with the far fetched concept that when using a mind altering drug made by some indigenous people in Mexico while being in a sensory depraved environment like those chambers were reasons enough to explain the changes happening to the main character always smacked me as something silly and could have only been concocted AND accepted in the 1970s. Aside from the fact that the combination of those two strained plot points were always big leaps to take, ones I always begrudgingly accepted because the rest was so good, the story had less to do with a 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY kind of mind-bending sci-fi than with an old fashioned Dr Jekyll & Mr Hyde, or in this case, Dr Jessup & Mr Ape Man. I wish they had come up with something more expansive for the cool concept of how centuries of human memory stored in the mind can subsequently alter the body itself with the proper trigger. But in the 1970s, drugs were the answer to everything and I guess it made sense for that time.Anyway, as I said, I always overlooked this weakness in ALTERED STATES because everything else is top drawer. That includes the great over-acting cast, the ridiculously wordy dialogue, the underlying wicked humor, the obvious but nonetheless cool visions/dreams, the sharp cinematography, the fantastic soundtrack, all fascinatingly orchestrated with remarkable and unusual clarity by Ken Russell, who's career peaked with this project and he never topped it with any of his subsequent (mostly bad) films. There are other great things about ALTERED STATES including the abundant nudity (male and female), that's never gratuitous but breathtakingly beautiful. The lusty, surreal contrasting styles of lucid scientific mumbo-jumbo with esoteric themes. The clever special effects. And to add even more to the cornucopia of good things, this was William Hurt's first starring role and what a debut it was. I've never seen such an impressive debut of an actor as this one. It's even better than Sigourney Weaver's debut in the equally great ALIEN made a year just before this. It's a shame Hurt's career flat-lined after winning an Oscar for KISS OF THE SPIDER WOMAN. If it wasn't for that weakest link in the story, I would rate ALTERED STATES as a masterpiece. "},{"Title":"Trippin' on Life","Date":"10 February 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":" I'll be honest. This the first movie I got to lie about my age with a bunch of friends to get into see by myself. This was before mega-plexes and folks could come in to a film 1/2 though and sit through it again just to see the whole thing...well...at least my friends and I had. We all saw Altered States in Center City Philadelphia at the end of 1979. At that time, there were several streets that were close to each other that were showing top feature films. We didn't intend to see Altered States, we just wanted to see a movie. And here's the big nostalgia piece of this story Altered States was not widely released until 1980, so we were one of the first to sneak peak it and didn't know that's what we did!!!I'll never forget the films we had to choose from that were playing in that section Hurricane (with SEN-SO-ROUND), Alien and Altered States. We heard that Hurricane was really bad except for the big budget hurricane scene (hence the SEN-SO-ROUND gimmick), and besides no one was at the theater. We heard that the only cool part in Alien is when the thing pops out of the man's chest and other than that it was boring (which much later I found to be untrue, I loved Alien!). And then there was Altered States which we knew nothing about. We thought we'd give it a whirl. We lied about our ages, payed our money and went in. This film blew our little minds. We didn't know any of the actors in the film, the film was one discovery after another.I immediately fell in love with William Hurt as Eddie Jessup. He was spot on as a brilliant and young tormented professor who would go on a relentless pursuit of Why am I here - what is life all for? ignoring everything in the present including the neglecting of his brilliant girlfriend/wife Emily, played by Blair Brown and his colleagues.Jessup has deep routed and unresolved psychological problems that seemed to begin when he was a child daily experiencing the slow and painful death of his father to whom he had deep affection for. Watching his demise daily set Jessup in motion to want to know what life and death was for.He grows up ever having that nagging question in his mind and in his psyche. He goes to college, excels...meets a part of himself he has buried in Emily. It is she that irks him into marriage. They have children, they seemingly grow apart ... because Jessup is still after his truth instead of his present.Jessup is informed that a tribe of Indians have a drug/substance that can assist him in reaching that of which he seems to want, so he goes and gets it, and experiments with it. The question is - is he placing himself in danger with this untried, unlicensed usage of this drug or is he actually finding out what he seeks? This film is a trip itself as we watch Jessup experiment with the drug and as he needs more 'free form buoyancy', he adds the sensory tank - where things really externalize with each administration of the drug. His colleagues (played by the wonderful Bob Balban and Charles Haid) and ex-wife are truly worried by this stage - not just about the experiments, but about his health - but Jessup feels he's growing every-so-close to his mission - to get it on with God. But is it that's he's after or is it something more closer to home? I didn't know anything about the controversy with the author Paddy, and how many directors walked off the set. All I know is that this was quite the cool and trippy film that gave you insight into one man's brilliant obsession with something he could not know or control. And that was wild to watch! A few years later when we all got older and totally into 80's new wave music ... we recognized the most famous and fantastic part of the film used in an 'A-HA' video and at that point we knew that this film was not quite the failure some thought it was. And the best way of flattery is imitation...and Altered States was/is imitated often. I was just glad to be one of the first folks to see it when it came out and that is how I will always remember it. We tripped with Jessup on one HUGE screen - super, earsplitting sound - wild imagery and me still wondering even today ....was this a trip in Jessup's mind or...real? A fun, wild ride - rent/buy it and see it with your wildest friends too!

Not exactly an appropriate film to observe when you're high on (soft-)drugs&#133;or maybe it is?I very much enjoy this kind of intelligent and imaginative horror/science fiction tales. Films like `Altered States' are a rarity, surrounded by an overload of empty-headed slashers and lamebrain violence. Ken Russell's film is very stylish and utterly pretentious but I DON'T intend to let that sound like a negative comment! Basically, this film is just another variant to the familiar plotline of `obsessive scientist goes one step too far with his experiments and faces horrific consequences', but Russell adds so many extra personal aspects to it and, as a viewer, you're really sucked down into his psychedelic escapade. The film mixes genetics with anthropology, pour on some religious elements&#133; There's even room for a remarkable and enchanting love story! Some of the visual effects are downright jaw-dropping and ahead of their time, for sure. Altered States easily is one of the few overlooked Sci-Fi milestones of the eighties. William Hurt does a great job in his cinema debut performance of Prof. Jessup, and he receives good feedback from a solid supportive cast including names like Charles Haid (Who'll Stop the Rain) and Bob Balaban (`2010'). Yet, I can't help thinking that the status of this film would be even better if was slightly more comprehensible and less confusing. Some of Professor Jessup's devoted motivations to keep going further aren't that clear and the different phases of his regress are a bit of a blunt at times.

I mean, after all, how many Hollywood movies in those days got their leading ladies stripped and having hot sex in the first ten minutes?  In 1980, a majority of leading ladies wouldn't do nudity.  This is BY NO MEANS the only reason to see ALTERED STATES.  Most of what Paddy Chayefsky wrote (MARTY, THE HOSPITAL, NETWORK) was brilliant, and much of ALTERED STATES is no exception. William Hurt (in his first starring role) plays a scientist studying levels of consciousness.  He marries the beautious Ms. Brown after a sex-charged whirlwind courtship and, before we (and probably Mr. Hurt) knows it, he has two children.  Hurt's character is so self-absorbed, the abruptness of the time change between courtship and parenthood is not surprising.  Hurt is far too interested in the underlying levels of consciousness innate because of evolution, but hidden (probably from social conditioning) to deal with such niceties as relationships with OTHER people.  His marriage crumbling, Hurt embarks on a trek to Mexico to engage in a conciousness-expanding ritual using the sacred mushroom (which actually exists, if one can believe the old ONE STEP BEYOND...television series).  Ingestion of the mushroom is supposed to revive the common experience of early humans. After a mind-blowing experience with a solution derived from the mushroom, Hurt returns with a sample to perform yet further experiments using the solution in conjunction with a sensory deprivation tank.  Hurt discovers by altering his consciousness, his physiological form alters as well, with disasterous results.POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD That being said, the movie ends abruptly and rather confusingly, with hurt learning there are very good reasons these primordial consciousnesses are not usually perceptable, and that our live's purpose is to experience by sharing consciousness with those we love.  Had the climax taken place in the laboratory, with someone explaining what the heck was going on, the movie would have been much more satisfying.

This is both a very straightforward style-wise and deliriously surreal film, where consciousness expansion turns into finding what might be the key to life. In other words, certainly not for all tastes- not least of which those that tried to skip through the 60s and 70s drug-wise. But it tells its story with a lot of guts and vigor, like a science-fiction spinner who's got both Phillip K. Dick and some obscure, oddball philosopher rummaging in his mind. It's also a great showcase for first-time leading man William Hurt, who throttles enough early on to keep you guessing (going over the edge, or on to something too fantastical to try and grasp), and then becoming perfectly intense as the second act goes along.Of course, some of this could just be really ridiculous, to the point of more than a few raised eyebrows. For example, there's at least a ten minute sequence in the film involving a certain ape, which is in equal measure strange and unintentionally funny. Though what Russell takes on with whatever was in the book in capturing the measures of hallucinations hasn't aged much in 20 something years. It's a visual stroke of amazement here and there, even as the special effects people DO almost go over the edge ala guy-in-the-tank with what ends up coming out of it. At least part of this climax is really stellar, and it caps off many a stylistic choice by Russell that ranks with his best (I loved a particular shot when Hurt is in Mexico, entering into the Indian tribe). I can see too why people were disappointed in the ending. It didn't end on a necessarily bad note, as there's the tinge of bittersweet to what's happened. But it also feels like it's abrupt as well, like a denouement is missing.Still, if you want to get a glimpse of the other side of the writer behind Marty and Network, and to see what Russell can do when he's both keen with the controls of the everyday reality scenes (i.e. normalcy) and allowed some clearance for some mad visions. Sometimes it doesn't even make perfect sense, but it's hard to carp given the premise. It's science fiction squarely about science, knowns and unknowns, and should make today for a unique drug movie.

Occasionally their hulking supervisor will sit in on their experiments and then yell at them in his odd, Muppet-like voice. Blair Brown rounds out the cast as Hurt's nice, attractive, and seemingly sane wife who is utterly devoted to him despite the fact that he's a boring jerk who thinks about the crucifixion while they're having sex.The first couple of hallucinating sequences are fun to watch, but the religious imagery was much better in the director's later work Lair of the White Worm and the flashy visions soon get tiresome. Eventually Hurt turns into a caveman and runs around hitting people with sticks and getting chased by wild dogs, and that's pretty good, but soon it's back to dull, incomprehensible techno-babble. There is some cool Dick Smith make-up sprinkled throughout the film, but the final climactic transformation is obscured by the photographic effects so you really can't get a good look at it.

As the wife, Blair Brown supplies way too much unneccessary nudity (not as much as Hurt of course) and says the word love too much. Of course she's overcompensating for her husband's inability to say it once, and the scene where she proposes to him is truly gut wrenching (ok, we'll get married since it's that important too I'm a guy incapable of saying 'I love you' myself so i can relate to Jessup in some way, but that is grotesque).The ending is very lame (guess what Jessup is finally able to say to his wife), but Paddy wrote that one so he only has himself to blame. Should be remade with a better director, namely anyone but Russell, who's way too obsessed with throwing in the visuals out nowhere (it would be better if the 'trips' were kinda eased into and shown in more detail (watch the first tank trip and also how those sand figures take up more time in the first shroom trip than the cool parts of it).

Back in the day when university professors could drop LSD scored from Peruvian tribes and sleep with their college students without Jesus Christ making a big stink on national TV.Eddie uses himself as the subject in the iso tank, driving ever deeper into sensory deprivation until director Ken Russell has to invest in extra creamy special effects to emulate the sensory overload a la 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY meets TRON. When a Primal Man eventually pops out of the iso tank, everything - as they say - goes ape.Loaded with intelligent dialog (often in well-executed overlapping arguments) and thought-provoking concepts, such as psychosomatic regression, expansion of unused brain lobes, ALTERED STATES almost attains that classic disturbing movie state (shots of regression back to cellular states, shots of organs functioning within the body, the Dune Worm state - !), but the Primal Man brought the movie to a screeching fourth-grade halt.It is, after all, just someone cavorting around in an ape suit.Oh well, it's Ken Russell. Mr. Erratic.Wacky psychedelia fireworks the movie's last sequences and we envy Eddie's LSD - musta be some deluxe sheee-it he scored from those tribespeople for it to short out the electricity in the university, crush all the pipes, blow out the windows and turn the isolation tank into a whirlpool...The greatest irony of this movie that took Bob Balaban and William Hurt from human to lizard to caveman, is that Balaban and Hurt can take the characters they play here - intelligent, clinical overdork scientists - and insert them unflinchingly into every single movie they make (from Balaban's 2010 ODYSSEY TWO to Christopher Guest's comedy oeuvre; from Hurt's THE BIG CHILL to MR.

Somewhat of a whiz kid, Hurt's character reads scripts that seem straight out of a textbook.  Theories on genetics, experiences with halucinogens, and those funky chemical names fly out of his mouth at 90 miles per hour, leaving you confused. Editing here wasn't so great.  Late 70's special effects were not very much advanced, so it can be accepted that the special effects will be lacking, but shifts in time seem to happen without warning; in one scene Hurt gets married, next scene, Hurt has 2 kids?Altered States is a run of the mill science fiction movie in that it takes an interesting premise and just sums it all up at the end with a fireworks show of special effects.  There is no bright idea brought into light, no questions left lingering in the viewer's mind after the film.  All that is left is that the power or God or truth that the scientist had been searching for is materialized into some sort of nefarious entity that Hurt fights against in a cheesy climatic battle.  This makes for a horrible ending.  Following the battle Hurt's character completely revises his life-long philosophy in a matter of seconds, and utters that phrase that is the hallmark of all cliches I love you.That there may be a way to tap into the information stored within the billions of years old atomic particles that make up our body and discover the truth about the meaning of life is a brilliant idea to ponder, and it could have been handled a billion ways better than it was in this film.

Certainly, the opposite of a stoner comedy. It was dead serious although there's a little unintentional humor to be found after a particular transformation. It was tough to wrap one's head around the symbolic meanings found in the visions of the sensory deprivation tank and the drug trip. I hope most of them have one and that it was not just psychedelic masturbation. If a movie would have benefited from a director's commentary explaining stuff, it would have been this one. However the visions are quite visually arresting and sometimes disturbing. They do hold a certain 2001-ending quality to them with the rapid cuts. There's a nightmarish feel to the whole proceedings helped by the creepy soundtrack. I thought the lead's acting by William Hurt, in his first movie role, was very good. Despite the decent acting, this movie didn't register emotionally with me it was cold. At the start, you get the sense the movie is going to discover something really deep and revolutionary but the final payoff is disappointing, obscure and dare I say a bit ridiculous. My necessary suspension of disbelief was gone not long after the start of the last experience in the sensory deprivation tank.

In other words, those people have confused the quality apes with the mere silly apes. Admittedly, the ape-going-bananas scenes are the least convincing in AS, but they serve the story, so what the hell... They're still far better and more logical than watching a huge gorilla climb tall NY buildings while getting excited over a tiny blond bimbo.In many ways AS is a typical Ken Russell movie all over the place with its manic, wild imagery. However, there is more discipline to be found. Barely any over-acting extravaganzas such as in Savage Messiah or Women In Love, this time around. Perhaps this is why he cast the drowsy Balaban and the low-key Hurt? Hyperactive, red-faced Russell had calmed down a bit by that time in his life. Not that the premise has ANY scientific basis whatsoever, but it is interesting, and the absurd, strictly fantasy-based idea is followed through intelligently. Sure, the more teary-eyed viewers would insist that this is a love story, first and foremost, but that's just an aspect that was thrown in for good measure - to please the female viewership that rarely gives a toss about anything even remotely sci-fi-ish. Besides, Russell is a bit of a predictable pansy, always needing love to be a major theme. At least it wasn't gay love this time around... Anyway, if you're searching for a love theme with a little more depth than the usual (s)he-loves-me-(s)he-loves-me-not drivel, AS has that.Visually the movie offers some stunning, original scenes. The dialogue is good. The only slight drawback is Hurt; to his credit he isn't his usual apathetic self, you can tell he does try, but there are several moments when he goes into the other extreme by over-playing the character. He was never much of an actor, so don't expect too much from him. As for the apatheticness, that area has been fully covered by Bob Balaban a poker-face if I've ever seen one, just as in all his other movies. This calm method method actor is the nepotistic waste product of a former studio head Barney Balaban. (Hurt is nepotistic, too.)There is a moment toward the end when events in the story become so spectacular that even Balaban wakes up for a while, shouting about science going into overdrive with Hurt's discovery. I don't think he's been that way in any other movie he's ever made. They must have given him an adrenaline shot or something... The bright spot in the cast is Blair Brown who seems very believable - apart from the silly, overplayed he doesn't love me scene toward the end.If you're making a movie that is supposed to be weird, do not actually use the word weird in the script. Brown and everyone else keep saying weird all the time, and that's kind of like saying this stuffy is so funny in a comedy, or this is so sad in a drama. Perhaps Russell was insecure if AS and Hurt's character were sufficiently weird, hence had to remind us constantly of it...

Using sensory deprivation, then adding powerful, hallucinogenic drugs, he explores these altered states&#x85; and endures experiences that make madness seem a blessing, according to official film synopsis, William Hurt as Jessup (his film debut) heads a solid cast featuring Blair Brown, Bob Balaban and Charles Haid. Working from Paddy Chayefsky's novel, director Ken Russell guides us with a sorcerer's skill through Eddie's magical and horrific journey as 'Altered States' gyrates with dazzling visual bravado and bracing emotional impact. Altered States seems more like a bigger budgeted version of a 1940s B movie than an attempt to film a thoughtful Chayefsky novel. But, Mr. Russell's direction, a fine cast, and the special effects keep it moving. The physics involved in some of the protagonist's changes are questionable - though, basing the altered states on evolutionary memory helps. There is a lot of religious imagery, and fundamentalists are likely to find the film's thesis achieved through wholly unacceptable means. As always, Dick Smith's monster make-up excels, this time on quintessential primal man Miguel Godreau.

This is an acid film, and since the only mind-altering substance at my disposal while watching this was a bottle of Labatt's, I don't think any explanation I can provide would really do this movie justice.  As a story, it's a convoluted mess.  But it succeeds to a great extent on the strength of its highly unique visual style.William Hurt plays a brilliant (yet clearly schizophrenic) psychiatrist who becomes fascinated with studying the induction of hallucinogenic trance-states via a sensory deprivation chamber.  He becomes convinced that within these altered states of consciousness lies the key to understanding some of the great secrets of life... death, religion, evolution, etc.  This obsession leads him to a mountaintop in Mexico, where he obtains a powerful mushroom concoction that is not likely to be approved by the FDA in the near future, and begins to allow Hurt to physically regress into increasingly primal states of being.  From there, the movie descends down some well-trodden paths (2001, Jekyll and Hyde) and culminates in a disappointingly conventional ending.  But Altered States only stumbles when it tries too hard to make sense-- and comes off as pretentious posing.  When it trips out and turns on its visual power, this is an impressive bit of art.  Bizarre religious imagery straight from the Book of Revelations captures beautifully the descent into the madness of a bad trip, and it only gets more mind-altering as the film progresses.Charles Haid gives a strong supporting performance, as does Blair Brown (and she's not a bad bit of eye candy, either.)  Ken Russell's direction is definitely over the top, but the special effects were quite well done, and made me long for the days before filmmakers were spoiled by today's hollow and lifeless CGI graphics.

If the experiments conducted in this movie for example perhaps could had led to a cure for cancer the whole story and characters would had worked out more compelling and the story as a whole would had been more intriguing.The movie is still more than a good one though. It's a movie that has David Cronenberg written all over it, except that it's not made by Cronenberg at all. See this movie perhaps as a mixture of Cronenberg's Videodrome and The Fly. The movie does definitely has some tripping visual moments in it, that are done very well and could had easily fitted in one of those early Cronenberg pictures like Videodrome or Scanners.The movie is helped made somewhat more believable by the fine actors that are in it. It was actually William Hurt's first cinematic movie role, while he was already 30. He was really fine in this movie, as the leading man. It also stars Bob Balaban, in one of his roles in which he plays a scientist again. For an 1980 movie it has some pretty good effects, though the movie still mostly relies on its editing techniques for its trippy moments. The movie often does a good job at creating both a science-fiction and horror feeling for the movie. The musical score by John Corigliano also helps with this.

Here science and the effects of hallucinogenic and/or psychotropic drugs themes and influences take over.Real science and pseudo-science intermix here with no clear boundaries and can be likened (if taken as such) as a commentary on the use (or mis-use) of LSD.Jessup takes these two elements to the ultimate extreme after hearing about and then visiting a tribe of Mexians who take a strange mixture using some (assumed) locally grown mushrooms to induce a state of shared memory where they regress to a more primitive state. Jessup participates in the ritual and when he returns he continues the experiment after a prolonged break (and marriage).This involves him taking a quantity of the medicine brought back from Mexico and placing himself into an isolation tank. He regresses back to a proto-hominid state and ends up being found naked in a zoo in the morning.How much hokum is involved here is debatable but as the author Paddy Chayefsky has disowned this movie it is reasonable to assume that much has been altered. The various regressions are portrayed in this film in various ways - firstly by the use of inter cut visual effects to simulate the experience to the viewer - weird optical effects, explosions and bizarre visuals - almost like a psychedelic wallpaper. It does leave the viewer thinking that one had to in effect be there to experience what Jessup was experiencing himself.This regression into a more primitive form of life has been tackled in a more mainstream (if you can call it that) episode of Star Trek The Next Generation entitled Genesis but the science behind that episode was even more hokey than here.As an exercise in blurring the lines between what is real and what is not it is effective and should raise some deep questions within the viewer about the nature of reality - a topic for which science fiction author Phillip K. Dick was well known for.Unfortunately it does not do so, merely skimming the surface and leaving the viewer feeling that the meat of the science is sadly lacking in any substance.Obviously the question of experimenting on humans does indeed open a very large can of worms and is a very emotive subject.The general viewer I feel will be left at the end feeling a little dazed and confused and there is not enough here for an in-depth study of philosophy. I do not think that a film of this nature that deals with this subject to any degree of detail would find a wide audience appeal.My summary stated that this felt very like an early Cronenberg effort and I stick by that - a poor 2nd to Cronenberg but if you want to while away a wet Sunday afternoon then watch it.Interesting idea poorly handled.

Okay, the black box is a scary image, and the vortex sequence is good in a Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite way, and the prosthetics are way ahead of 1980. But really, did the Network guy write this? C'mon man--you're saying that peyote plus an enclosed space filled with four inches of water plus a dude with latent schizophrenia opens all the doors of space and time, externally and to the physical world. No. NO. I giggled, naturally. All things considered, a turd with moments. TRIPPY MOMENTS.

Some his movies are difficult to understand, but there are some where is no need for even trying. Altered States is one of them and even always-brilliant William Hurt can't save the day. This could've been the anthem for LSD generation... on the other hand, is it really possible to make anthem for such kind of thing? Ken Russell tried it in his own specific way. He obviously wanted to say something. But he loses this something somewhere in the middle of the movie, between the terms of Christianity, darwinism, Indian cults and cosmology. Hard to say whether it is just inability to film such book or Russell couldn't form his own vision but what this movie manages to be is a great illustration of delirious searches for the meaning of life with the help of hard drugs. Scary in a way. And very average from cinematographic point.

The idea of regression to primeval man was interesting, but the story lost its impact in the last half due to insipid dialog and excessive focus on the love interest part of the story. It becomes almost impossible to empathize with William Hurt's character as it becomes more and more clear that he is willing to sacrifice anything and anyone to satisfy a how-many-angels-can-dance-on-the-head-of-a-pin brand of intellectual curiosity. And why do both sets of guards go down into the lab cellar armed only with nightsticks, when any rational person would have locked the door from above and called either the police, or the Humane Society?

This is one. What is that look blasphemous statements, unnecessary nudity and/or sex, profane, unrealistic and sleazy characters.The prime example here are two of the main character of the story the main one, Prof. Eddie Jessup, played by William Hurt and another key player, Professor Mason Parrish played by Charles Haid. The latter, a highly- educated scientist from Harvard is ridiculously profane and crude. The fact he's an avowed atheist and none of his views are contested by anyone else is no surprise but someone that base, character-wise, would never be in that profession. Come on......at least make some attempt to make characters plausible! It reminded me of the astronauts in the Alien series a bunch of low- life trashy people - just not realistic. All of that made me lose interest in the film halfway and I didn't care nor respect the script enough to enjoy the second half.The only cool thing about the film were the hallucinatory images. Those were pretty wild and interesting to view. "}]
