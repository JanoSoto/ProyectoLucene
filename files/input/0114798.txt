The drama is much more at the end involving Andie McDowell's character.Supposedly, this is a true-life story of Steven Franz Lidz and his wacky family - the kid (Nathan Watt), the father (John Turturro) and the two uncles (Maury Chaykin and Michael Richards.). The story has a lot of Jewish flavor and religious themes, pro and con. It's not an easy story to explain so I won't go past what I've said that it's simply an interesting portrait of a different-kind of family with lots of laughs early on but tears later. You could get an idea early on that it's kind of a sweet movie, but there are some uncomfortable scenes in here. There is a little bit of about everything, guaranteed to strike everyone's emotions somewhere along the way. The story stayed with me long after I first watched it.

How could anyone NOT love this movie? It's so good. Andie MacDowell and John Turturro make such  a cute movie couple. The real show stealer was Michael Richards. Through the movie, you're not saying, 'Hey, why is Kramer being serious?' Instead, you say, 'Wow, Michael Richards is a good actor.' This was a rare opportunity to see him do a better-than-Kramer-by-not-being-Kramer performance. I would love to see him do more serious work like this. It's very tearful at the end. Parts are mildly funny, but this movie is pure drama and it's beautiful.

It focuses on Steven Lidz, a Jewish boy in the early 1960's whose happy life is upset when his mother Selma (Andie MacDowell) is diagnosed with cancer. Unable to bear it, he moves in with his blacklisted uncles, Danny (Michael Richards) and Arthur (Maury Chaykin). They teach Steven about his Jewish heritage, and by the end of the movie, he has had his bar mitzvah and feels freer in his existence.Some of the plot points may seem a little hackneyed, but Diane Keaton knows how to tell the story so that it isn't a clich√©. A very good look at how the general atmosphere and zeitgeist in a certain part of American history affected one family.

I think it's because of the lack of more movies like these and also because of the innocence in them, that we as adults want to hold on to. This movie was a baggage of surprises for me...Finding Andie McDowell play a role very different from the ones she has so far played. It was a pleasure to see a mainstream Hollywood actor like her act in a movie that is not very commercial. It is a children's movie, but is thankfully devoid of the new-kid-on-the-block talk we hear in so many children's movies. Learning later that Diane Keaton was the director was another really pleasant surprise! She has done a very commendable job with this movie! What I liked about this movie was how a child's world was captured, with the camera almost being a character in the movie as it explored places hitherto unknown...the camera was almost made to be an extension of Steven's character, with he, like Alice in Wonderland being awed and overwhelmed by the absurd world of his uncles and other adults. Nothing in the world could have accentuated the beauty of this movie than Thomas Newman's music. This man is a maestro of sorts! His music for the movie 'Corrina, Corrina' is one of my favorites! Interestingly, even in that movie, his best renditions are while showing the world through a child's eyes(Tina Majorino). Newman's music brings to the movie an other worldly quality. It lends to the otherwise mundane lives of the characters an aura of mystery, magic and a celestial quality that makes them so memorable! He is really one of the best Hollywood music directors at the moment and I only hope that he continues to spin his magic as he has been doing for so long!Nathan Watt as Steven has given a really sensitive performance..he's the main protagonist of the movie, it is his world we are drawn into. Kudos to him for such an endearing performance! Michael Richards is excellent as the phony-bashing uncle of Steven's!! He's getting better everyday, with his recent portrayal of Mr. Micawber in the latest version of 'David Copperfield'. The rest of the cast, all of them are really good! The last scene, when Steven is watching video tapes of his mother with his father is one of the most touching in the movie... This is one of those movies that celebrates the innocence of a child and a few adults who want to retain that innocence in a superficial and phony world.

From Franz Lidz's autobiographical book, it's the story of his experiences coming to terms with his mother's cancer (described to him by his father as a very bad cold), and the changes within his family brought about by her illness. Offered little more in the way of explanation or reassurance by his father who is naturally overwhelmed with losing his beautiful wife (well-played by Andie MacDowell), the boy bonds for the first time with his two endearingly oddball uncles. The emotional aspects and situations are expressed subtly but richly, with a warm cinematic vision. John Turturro is excellent as the boy's father, who we see as being rather cold and cerebral, always preoccupied and dismissive. The father is a genius, the mother tells her son, explaining that his scientific mind might make him seem like he's from another planet, but to try and cut him some slack and learn to appreciate him. His true feeling and human quality is finally exposed when, during an extended study of his face late in the film, Turturro shows us all the emotion of this brilliant young man who is helpless in the face of his wife's devastating disease.The certifiably mad Uncle Danny is played by Michael Richards, who is finally given the opportunity to bring his Kramer, of Seinfeld fame, to a fully realized and hilariously paranoid characterization. Going to live for a time with Uncle Arthur and Uncle Danny, the boy, Steven (re- named Franz by his uncles and played impressively by then 12-year-old Nathan Watt) experiences a look into his family history and decides to study for his Bar Mitzvah, contrary to his atheist father's wishes. He also cleverly engineers a solution to the Lindquist Problem (a war the uncles have going on with their landlord), and learns to care for and about the two of them. Thus he returns home to his immediate family and his dying mother, newly confident and better equipped to cherish the remaining moments of her life.This is a special movie and I couldn't recommend it more highly. There's no sense of the maudlin where it might have gone that way, but there is great humor that will be enjoyable to a wide range of ages.

A story of a boy coming of age while dealing with a dying mother and rebelling against his father all in the context of a loving extended family.  The (Jewish) cultural angle gave it authenticity.  A fine performance by Nathan Watt but that John Turturro is really something.  Michael Richards was essentially Kramer again.  Interesting in that it is a woman director (Diane Keaton) who brings this story of male family love to the screen.  While mom is very loving as well, she sadly and symbolically abandons Steven/Franz by dying and it is the weird (eccentric and harmlessly schizophrenic) uncles who support him thru it all, once again posing the question, Who really are the crazy (or heroes, for that matter) among us?

His father is (we are told) a brilliant inventor; Steven adores his mother and is adored in return. Steven's relatives include two genially crazy uncles, Danny and Arthur, who live together in an apartment across town. Precise diagnoses are never discussed and their behavior is seen from the point of view of a boy, but they both appear to have variants of schizophrenia, Danny being paranoid and Arthur more undifferentiated. Steven's almost blissful family life is cruelly interrupted when his mother becomes ill with cancer. Unhappy with his home life after the change, he 'runs away' to live with his uncles. Their apartment is a crowded archive of their mental illness. Steven is alternately fascinated and mortified by their bizarre behavior, but by sharing their world, he becomes a better person. This movie has no real plot or payoff, but it is captivating and moving. My upbringing was completely different from Steven's, but as a member of a Jewish family that has produced both some very bright people and some very crazy people, I can say that the film conveys the accuracy of 'felt life'. It is the antithesis of today's usual deadly conformist, formulaic and violence-ridden Hollywood films.Nathan Watt does a very good job as Steven. John Turturro as his father is part of the long and distinguished tradition in American film and television of Italians playing Jews (and vice versa); he's done it at least once before (Barton Fink). You can't help but see a bit of Cosmo Kramer in Michael Richards's performance as Danny. Best of all was Arthur as played by that shambling, rumpled Canadian bear Maury Chaikin. Most of the IMDb reviews rave about Andie MacDowell, but this Jewish reviewer feels that in fact she was woefully miscast as Steven's mother Selma; in her looks, her speech, her mannerisms, her body language, and her demeanor, she totally fails to convince as a New York Jewish woman. This was the sort of role that should have gone to someone like Lisa Edelstein, Bette Midler, Tovah Feldshuh or Debra Winger.

In the end there a few lines by 'Franz' that are a little too much on the obvious and sentimental side, but it's easy to forgive this warm, yet sometimes painfully harsh - somehow in an understated manner - film.

Most of Sid's inventions are rather ridiculous, like a retractable canopy for a bed, with an escape hatch that is just an opening. I assume that Sid's inventions were exaggerated in order to create an image of him as a weird scientist, but his inventions were too trumped up just for effect for me to believe.Steven's mother is dying of cancer and, between his father's craziness and his mother's illness, Steven decides to run away to live with two of his uncles. Sid is normal compared to the uncles. Uncle Arthur rummages through trash to collect any item he finds interesting. He collects bouncing balls. In one scene Steven opens a closet door only to be engulfed by a couple hundred balls stored there. Think about that, how could that storage be accomplished? Except on a movie set. Steven's uncle Danny is paranoid and is always running from some imaginary pursuer, doing stupid things like entering a house through a window in order to avoid being detected. As Danny, Michael Richards' frenetic antics so irritated me that I almost bailed.Maury Chaykin, as Arthur, evinces some warmth, and, as Steven, Nathan Watt gives the most natural performance of all the actors. These two performances were about the only positives for me. Forced zaniness played against a backdrop of terminal cancer is a tricky thing to pull off and this story failed in its attempt. These people were never real enough for me to be engaged.

The uncles are hoarders and one is extremely paranoid. Though it's not really a coming-of-age story, the boy does expand his horizons through the unusual insights of his two uncles, one of whom collects, among everything else, balls because they carry the sound of children playing within them. It's a fairly interesting movie but nothing groundbreaking. Director Diane Keaton does about as well as anyone can with the material at hand. The two odd uncles provide a unique look at life to a confused young boy's eyes. John Turturro as the father is pretty unusual when we meet him as well but he loses his quirkiness once his wife, Andie MacDowell, comes down with an illness from which there is no hope of escape. The boy, now given a sense of self and purpose from his uncles, now has to rescue his father from giving up on life. The movie sways from comedy to pathos but is worth a viewing.

My biggest criticism is that the stacks of newspapers and junk in the uncles' apartment were unrealistically neat. Whoever did the set design has never seen the real deal, and it shows! They did manage, however, to avoid pinning the film to a specific time and place, which allowed the film to seem apart from normal experience, somewhere between reality and someone's very personal dreamworld. Unstrung Heroes is not a big film. It has no definitive message, and it may never become well-known. It was made in an artful manner, rather than for box office receipts, however, and that is one quality I deeply respect.
