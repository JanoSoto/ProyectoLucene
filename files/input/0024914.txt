[{"Title":"Shirley fiddles while Jane burns!","Date":"11 April 2001","Score":"19 out of 21 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":"  Rare is the scene in a Shirley Temple film where Curly Top is reduced to a mere spectator while another actor grabs the spotlight and runs screaming with it, but Bright Eyes has them in bunches! See Shirley gasp as human pit bull Jane Withers dismembers a doll before her very eyes! Tremble with fear as Shirley flees from her possessed playmate when their Santa Claus discussion takes a nasty turn! And if you think young Joy is a terror now, imagine how bad she'd be without psychoanalysis. In the movie's far too numerous non-Jane scenes, Shirley reverts to her old role as top banana with predictably charming results. No Shirley Temple film can really get rolling until her parents have been killed, so Mother is done in about half-way through, while Dad offs it before the opening credits, freeing our young pixie for another delightful custody battle. (By the way, do you suppose kids of the 1930's took a secret satisfaction in watching Shirley's parents get systematically rubbed out in every one of her movies? After all, her new parents were always a step up from the old ones; richer, prettier and usually much more fun. Life as an orphan might not have looked so bad to a depression-era tot after seeing a Shirley Temple picture.)In conclusion, this movie is highly recommended for Shirley's fans and foes alike. Watch it for Shirley's smile or Jane's scowl, and stay tuned till the end. You won't want to miss the most satisfying closing shot in the history of cinema.

The rest of the film is almost as charming as that song with many sweet, touching moments that made her films so endearing.It also helped to have James Dunn as the male lead. Dunn was one of the more likable guys in classic Hollywood, on and off the screen. He and Shirley make a great pair. Other interesting people to watch in this movie are the crabby old grandfather, played by Charles Sellon; the spoiled brat played by Jane Withers, who is so bad she's funny and an assortment of other characters from fliers to cooks to old girlfriends.The only negative is the ending. It looked like they didn't know how to end this, so they rushed to finish it without much thought. Oh, well, the main thing is Shirley's charm.....and that's there in abundance.

Although the film tends to lag into melodramatics during the final half hour, Shirley brightens everything considerably when she appears. With her undeniable talent & elfin smile, it's easy to see why she became Hollywood's top box office star.However, the Mighty Mite does have competition. Jane Withers is on hand as the Ultimate Brat, a dreadful child who likes to play with imaginary machine guns and amputate body parts off of dolls. Although she looks alarmingly like OUR GANG's Alfalfa in drag, Withers is wonderful and the perfect antidote for those who may find Miss Temple a tad bit icky sticky. To say that Miss Withers practically plunders the picture from The Moppet is high praise, indeed.James Dunn appeared in four films with Shirley in 1934; in BRIGHT EYES he has his finest scenes with her. As her dead father's best buddy, Dunn is quite touching in his devotion to the child. Elderly character actor Charles Sellon has some funny scenes as a most obstreperous old blister. His contempt for Miss Withers is a joy to behold.Jane Darwell was always a welcome addition to any cast; here she plays a lovable Irish cook. Brandon Hurst as her prim English butler husband, Judith Allen as Dunn's love interest, Lois Wilson as Shirley's doomed mother, and Theodore von Eltz & Dorothy Christy as Withers' pestilential parents all add to the movie's enjoyment.Shirley sings what was to become her signature song - &#145;On The Good Ship Lollipop' - and it is a highlight of the film. Many first time viewers, having heard the song all their lives, may be surprised to learn it's about a plane, not a boat - in this case, from American Airlines.

Whether playing an orphan or a child with a living parent, in BRIGHT EYES, Shirley has a mother whose aviator father cracked up some time ago. She is loved and admired by everyone except her mother's employers. This also marks a rare case in which Shirley is pitted against another little girl, a complete opposite to her angelic character, as well as the introduction to Temple's signature song, On the Good Ship Lollipop by Richard Whiting and Sidney Clare, singing it to the fellow aviators on an airplane as it taxis on the runway, and her catch phrase of Oh, my goodness!The story, set during the Christmas season in California, revolves around Shirley Blake (Shirley Temple), a charming 5-year-old living in a mansion with her widowed mother, Mary (Lois Wilson), employed as a maid for the snobbish and selfish Smythe family Anita (Dorothy Christy), J. Wellington (Theodore Von Eltz) and their unruly daughter, Joy (Jane Withers). Also under their wing is the cranky Uncle Ned Smith (Charles Sellon), a wheel-chair bound old man, and Mr. and Mrs. Higgins (Brandon Hurst and Jane Darwell), a middle-aged couple working as butler and cook, who all have a soft spot for little Shirley. One of Shirley's greatest pleasures is heading over to the American Airlines Airport where she spends time with her godfather, James Loop Merrill (James Dunn), a pilot whose best friend was Shirley's deceased father. When Shirley's mother is struck by a passing vehicle on her way to attend her a Christmas party at the airport, the child, now an orphan, becomes a charity case for the Smyths, who in reality take her in and her dog, Rags, too, only to please their Uncle Ned. Because Loop is a bachelor, he's unable to take in Shirley. He even refuses the help of Adele Martin (Judith Allen), a society girl staying with her cousin Anita's home for Christmas, because he refuses to forgive her for jilting him at the altar years ago. When it's learned that Uncle Ned intends on adopting Bright Eyes, this not only finds the Smythe family in fear of losing their inheritance after he dies, but Loop to risk his life flying his airplane in uncertain weather to obtain enough money for an attorney to fight for the custody of Shirley against the old man in court.BRIGHT EYES is one of the few Temple movies where she's nearly overshadowed by her co-stars, namely Charles Sellon and Jane Withers. Sellon's performance predates that of Lionel Barrymore years before cranky old men in wheelchairs became fashionable. Aside from coming down the stairs in his wheelchair, Sellon's Uncle Ned has some truly funny lines as well as a great moral message about selfishness and love. Withers, in the first important screen role, plays a spoiled brat to perfection. She not only has tantrums, rips apart dolls, and wanting to play train wreck with Shirley, but is the only little girl in history to want a wheelchair as a Christmas present. Fortunately her unlikable performance didn't put an end to her career. In fact, it started a whole new cycle of Jane Withers movies. While Temple remains the most famous child star in history, Withers, whose career at 20th-Fox lasted longer than Temple's, is virtually forgotten, and due to her only association with Temple, BRIGHT EYES would become the only Withers film from the 1930s in circulation today.Great moments of BRIGHT EYES include Shirley's mother telling her a Christmas story with chorus singing Silent Night in the background, and a tender loving scene where Dunn's character, in a choked-up manner, having to tell Shirley that her mother has gone to Heaven. Shirley's response, You mean, my mother cracked up, too? This alone is classic Temple, with Dunn constantly asking her throughout the story, How much do you love me? He even gives her his magic ring to send to him whenever she's in trouble. All this sounds corny in print, but actually plays better on the screen.Formerly available on video cassette and currently on DVD either in black and white and colorized process, BRIGHT EYES has played on numerous cable TV stations throughout the years The Disney Channel (1980s), American Movie Classics (1996-2001), Turner Classic Movies (TCM premiere September 6, 1998) and even The Fox Movie Channel. In spite of its age, BRIGHT EYES is sure to delight adults, children and optometrists alike. Be sure not to miss the good ship lollipop.

She was so small she had to be lifted up to reach the microphone. She was the mischief-maker of the Kiddy Club program, called The Little Pest. Like Mitzi Green, she had an uncanny ability to imitate the voices and facial expressions of actors, actresses and other people, something she learned playing with the mirror. On stage by age five, she became a famous actress throughout the South, finally moving to Hollywood at five-and-a-half. In Hollywood, Jane began by playing in a weekly radio-revue and gave numerous stage performances for beneficial organizations.Bright Eyes was Jane's first credited movie role and led to a long-term contract with Twentieth Century-Fox. She stared in numerous movies of the thirties, and was Shirley Temple's main competition. Jane was one of the great child actresses of all times, very popular with the children of her era, and after watching Shirley's goodie two-shoes act in Bright Eyes playing against Jane's power-house comedy performance, I can see why. Shirley Temple was her usual cute, sugar-coated, man-worshiping self with everyone giggling politely at her jokes except the audience. In contrast, Jane Withers had my daughter and I laughing our heads off until we had stomach-aches. Jane in Bright Eyes was bratty, adorable and hilarously funny. Her brat act has seldom, if ever, been equaled in the annals of film.It is really a shame, and I hope the studios who own Jane Withers' many films as a child take note, that Bright Eyes is the only Jane Withers performance to survive to contemporary video. What ever happened to her movies Ginger, Paddy O'Day, Gentle Julia, Little Miss Nobody, Can This be Dixie? and Pepper?  In a published chat-room article Jane, who is still very much alive, says that she will eventually finish her book on her child star days. Like the kids of Our Gang, she remembers a fun, privileged childhood and has nothing in the way of sob stories. Let's hope that the studios will stop suppressing her films and release them on video soon, perhaps coinciding with her book.

Scenes between Temple and Dunn are so natural that you'll have a hard time not getting a lump in your throat in the scene where he assures her that her mother (who has just died) is in heaven with the angels. Yes, it does get a little sticky at times.But wait!! Before things become to saccharine and predictable, little JANE WITHERS, America's most lovable brat, shows up as a nasty rich girl who delights in tormenting everyone around her, especially Shirley. It's a great role for Jane and she makes the most of it, whether imitating a machine-gunner or threatening to make mincemeat of Shirley's dolls.And believe me, she's a welcome presence in a Shirley Temple vehicle that does tend to get all dewy-eyed over the adorable princess. Watch the scene on the plane where the aviators all watch Temple as she sings On the Good Ship Lollipop, strolling down the aisle and enjoying all the male attention. You can almost sense something darker than is supposed to meet the eye with the way they all leer at her. But she is, quite simply, at her most fetching in that casually charming little number.Shirley's first film tailored just for her, and it opened at Radio City Music Hall in 1934 to cheer Depression-era audiences with its innocent star at her most disarming. Easy to see why she would become the nation's number one box-office star four years in a row.

After this she was always Little Miss Fixit, usually wiser than the adults, manipulating the people around her, whether by tears, songs or sweet looks to her particular needs. Of course the main reason to see this film is Jane Withers. She is a riot as Joy, whether trying to run Shirley over, slapping her dolls into good behaviour, pounding away on the piano or asking for a machine gun for Christmas. She proved that brats have more fun in the movies (except at the end when she gets her come-uppance). I can remember watching Jane Wither's films as a child - she was certainly a lot more bubbly and energetic than Shirley and I agree with the other reviewers, there should be more of her films in release.The first sight is of Shirley, looking adorable, in aircap, goggles and leather coat - she is thumbing a ride to the airport to see Loop (James Dunn). He was her daddy's best friend and tells her stories about her father's flying adventures before he cracked up. Her mother is employed by the Smythes, a high flying family (excuse the pun), counting on the expectations of rich Uncle Ned. Their daughter, Joy, is the ultimate spoilt brat whose obnoxious behaviour is encouraged by her psychiatrist, who tells her parents not to criticize but always give her positive encouragement. Jane Withers is the whole show - in her scenes with Shirley she completely dominates the screen (and not only because she is twice as tall)!!!Uncle Ned's one consolation is Shirley and after her mother is killed in a road accident he is determined to adopt her. Before all the drama Shirley gets to sing her most famous song, On the Good Ship Lollipop to the crew of Loop's plane. Did she ever get sick of singing that song I wonder??? Loop's one time fiancé, Adele (Judith Allen) comes to stay with the Smythes and falls under Shirley's spell. She and Uncle Ned join forces to try to adopt her but Loop also wants Shirley. James Dunn had such a rapport with Shirley - he was by far the best of her male co-stars. He was a bright and breezy leading man who should have had a bigger career.After another scene with Joy - this time about Shirley's dog Wags, Shirley decides to use Loop's magic ring and runs away. She hides in the plane that Loop uses for an unexpected mail run to New York. In the film's most exciting sequence Loop and Shirley bail out when the plane is caught in a fierce storm. Their parachutes almost go over the cliff and Shirley quips Let's do it again!!!This is one of her best films and it is really lifted by the co-stars. Apart from Jane Withers, Charles Sellon is an absolute scene-stealer as Uncle Ned. Jane Darwell often played sympathetic roles in Temple movies and Dorothy Christy, who always enhanced any movie she was in plays Anita Smythe.Recommended.

I thought that her movies were all-out musicals for kids only, but she was more for the family and all-ages market. Bright Eyes is not a kids' movie, nor is it really a musical, other than the famous Good Ship Lollipop number. That number is, I think, more indicative of a trend in the early sound period where nearly every movie made tried to incorporate a scene with music. I thought the movie was going to be predictable, and it mostly is; the Smythe family never really become more than one-dimensional caricatures, ready to toss the lovely Shirley out onto the street while still indulging their own demonic daughter's every whim. Still, it managed to surprise me in a few places. Loop and Uncle Ned, the two most awesome characters and the ones who care about Shirley the most, suddenly become enemies as they each try to claim custody. **SPOILER ALERT** I was almost in tears a couple times when Shirley's mom dies was pretty rough (though that car hit looked awfully gentle), and Loop flying through the storm is pretty intense. **END SPOILER** If you're trying to get an idea of what Shirley Temple was all about in Depression-era Hollywood, Bright Eyes is a great place to start. Contract Player Alert Charles Sellon (Uncle Ned) and Jane Withers (Joy) both appeared three films ago in It's a Gift, as Mr. Muckle and the hopscotch girl, respectively. KEVIN This movie surprised me. I really didn't expect to like it much, but the themes of the film and the complexity of many of the characters kept me interested. Of course little Shirley is great, everyone knows that, but all the adult characters, none of whom I recognized right off, are all very well acted and fully fleshed out. **SPOILER ALERT** I'm not gonna lie, I was indeed moved to tears in the scene where Loop (James Dunn) must tell little Shirley that her Mom has died. **END SPOILER** And I was even more intrigued when Shirley is taken in by the snobbish, blue-blooded Smythe couple with their bratty, Nazi-in-training daughter (Jane Withers). Although the custody battle between Loop and the Smythes is the center of the movie, the film does a really good job setting up the characters and getting all its ducks in a row for maximum emotional punch. I couldn't help but giggle at the schmaltzy happy ending, starting with the judge deciding that the proceedings won't need lawyers anymore. Everyone gets what they want and/or what they deserve, even the crotchety uncle.Last film The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934). Next film The Scarlet Pimpernel (1934).

Joy-ful memories","Date":"20 March 2015","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":" My review title contains a quote from Shirley, in response to pilot Loop questioning if she's OK. As the only passengers in Loop's small plane caught in a violent thunderstorm, Loop eventually decided they that he and stowaway Shirley must do a parachute jump with just his one chute(why?). They did so, with a hard landing in an open area on a mountain. Unfortunately, the violent wind then pulled the still-attached parachute toward a very high cliff, dragging them along, until Loop finally gets the harness free just before they are to be pulled over the cliff... Before this incident, Loop had taken little Shirley, with aspirations of becoming a pilot, high up in his plane, supposedly close to heaven, telling her that her mother was so lonely for her crash-killed father that she decided to join him in heaven. You mean she cracked up, too Shirley responded one of the tear-jerking moments in the film....In another scene inside a plane, on the ground, she sings her classic On the Good Ship Lollipop. The plot reflects Shirley's real life ambition to become a pilot. But at that time, she wasn't allowed in a flying plane, for insurance reasons.It's my contention that Shirley's core films represented, in large part, a talkie female equivalent of the silent Little Tramp. Like Chaplin's Tramp, she was in some ways child -like and in some ways adult-like, cast as being an isolated entity, usually in an unstable, marginal, family relationship, through no fault of her own. Unlike most families with children of the time, she was always cast as an only child and, in most films, interacted mostly or exclusively with adults very different from the case in the contemporary Our Gang series. But, in contrast to the stereotypical spoiled bratty only child represented in the extreme by Jane Wither's character(Joy) in the present film, she was characterized as most valuing loving associations with adults who were unattached with other adults, seemingly lonely, but who found in her a kindred spirit, which brought to the surface a loving, caring, person.In this film, Shirley identifies with old Uncle Ned, and he with her, despite he being generally grouchy, demanding, and wheelchair-bound. , because they are both forced to live in this household as outsiders of the nuclear family(Smythes), not loved by any of its members(especially Joy). Ultimately, this relationship appears to work out for the benefit of both. But , there is the important complicating factor of flier Loop(James Dunn), who is her best friend, godfather, and surrogate father, having been the best friend of her deceased father. He also insists that he can take care of Shirley, with the sudden death her mother on Christmas day. Thus, we have a court battle between Uncle Ned and Loop over which, if either, will become Shirley's legal guardian. Shirley is very lucky that the judge decides to make her desire paramount in his decision. In choosing Loop, plus his estranged girlfriend, plus Uncle Ned, she, along with the judge, apparently solve the problem, by declaring that the 3 live together with Shirley, leaving the arrogant, mean, greedy Smythes holding the bag(cut out of Uncle Ned's inheritance. It's wonder they hadn't poisoned him by now!). Unfortunately, given the animosity recently shown between Loop and Uncle Ned, and between Loop and his estranged girlfriend, this arrangement realistically looks awfully forced, perhaps likely to fragment soon. But, it might work, given Shirley's glue.Jane Withers, as the Smythe's seemingly psychopathic daughter, ironically named Joy, gives a riveting portrayal, for the times, of a spoiled brat of a well-to-do family. Clearly, Joy enjoys cruelty and negativity, as evidenced by the bossy treatment of much smaller Shirley, her dismemberment of her former doll, which Shirley found in the trash, a penchant for imagining she is killing people with a machine gun(her requested Christmas present), her constant spanking of her dolls, and her purposeful irritating of Uncle Ned. True, these behaviors aren't that unusual in this culture for boys, but not girls. she immediately throws away or breaks her Christmas gifts, claiming she only wanted a wheelchair like Uncle Ned's(presumably so others would treat her with more kindness, and as a very unexpected novelty)...At one point, Shirley turns the tables on Joy, when the later tries to wreck Shirley's baby carriage, with a vigorous side collision with her own carriage. But, Shirley pulls her carriage out of the line of fire at the last moment, causing Joy's carriage to smash into a stone wall, sending her and her carriage sprawling. This has to be the most satisfying moment in the film!. Of course, Joy claimed that Shirley(much smaller) pushed her down. The second most satisfying moment is the ending.Reportedly, screenwriter and director David Butler got the idea for Shirley and her mother living in the home of their employer from his own experience as a child. This was the first of 4 Shirley-starring films that Butler directed. In a directing career that spanned more than 40 years, It's not surprising to learn that he directed TV's Leave it to Beaver. While at Warner, he also directed some of Bob Hope's classic comedies, and some of Doris Day's early musicals.This was the last of 3 films featuring Shirley, in which James Dunn played her surrogate or actual father. While lacking the physical charisma of some of her later male leads, obviously he had great rapport with Shirley, with modest musical and comedic talent(check out Baby Take a Bow). Unfortunately, with the merger of Fox and Twentieth Century in 1935, he was reassigned, and a few years later developed a chronic drinking problem.

I assumed the were cloying and I hate child actors. However, I ran into a problem on Netflix--I'd seen just about everything and ALL of the classic films. So, reluctantly, I decided to try a couple. To my surprise, the films are, for the most part, delightful--much of it because Temple was a simply amazing child actress. No matter how much I knew the studio was manipulating the audience, I just couldn't help but adore the child. Despite being almost like the product of some unholy breeding experiment because she was SO perfect, I just couldn't resist her charm.Of all the Shirley Temple movies I've seen (and by now I've seen most), I would have to say that Bright Eyes is the best. It is sweet but it also has a nice balance of nastiness that really helps the film along. Let me explain...while Shirley is wonderful, counter-balancing it with the Smythe family, and especially their bratty child (Jane Withers). I loved Withers in the film--she played the most bratty and nasty little girl--and it took a lot of talent to make her character THIS awful! So, we have two of the greatest child actresses of all-time in one film! The plot is, in some ways, a bit like Cinderella...just a bit. It begins with Shirley and her widowed mother living and working at the home of the rich but horrid Smythe family. Aside from their uncle (played WONDERFULLY by Charles Sellon), the entire brood are worthless people--and they couldn't care less about sweet Shirley or her mother. However, when Shirley's mother is killed, the uncle INSISTS the child be treated like a member of the family and move out of the servants' quarters. The Smythes can't stand her--but they want the uncle's money and they agree. But what about her guardian, Luke (James Dunn)? He adores the child and can't think of living without her. So what will become of all this? See this nice film and see.A wonderful blend of sentiment and comedy, I can't help but recommend this film. In addition, you'll get to hear Shirley's terrific rendition of Good Ship Lollipop--an amazingly toe-tapping tune. With all the wonderful acting (Dunne, Sellon, Withers and Temple especially), this is the Twentieth Century-Fox formula at its very best. Unless you are even more cynical than me, you will find you can't help but love this film.

She is supposed to believe in Santa (while arch-nemesis Jane Withers does not); and you can tell that Little Miss Moppet does believe in Santa the way she says her lines. This is 'true' acting. And the scene where she kisses the old man in the wheelchair and says she likes him is brimming with truth, too. You can sense that this child performer does like adults who treat her kindly. And the moment when she puts her head on his lap is predictably sweet but no less effective-- gently reminding adults how to properly treat children.Yet despite all these charming aspects of David Butler's script (he also directed the picture), we know we are being manipulated for some serious drama ahead. Shirley starts out fatherless (except for surrogate daddy figure James Dunn) and by the 37th or 38th minute of the story, she is completely orphaned when her mother is killed on the street one day.Signal the tears. Lots and lots of tears. The scene where James Dunn learns about the mother's death while Shirley waves from inside the plane is tough to watch. Then, there's the sequence where he takes her up in the plane and while floating over some clouds, he tells her about heaven and her mother joining her father in heaven. She breaks down while he flies the aircraft and it is devastating. I can only imagine how audiences responded to this the first time it was seen in the 1930s. How can there be a dry eye left in the house after that tender, truthful display of emotion?And this is where Mr. Butler and Fox pull out all the stops. Shirley has lost both her parents now, on Christmas Day of all days. And miraculously, she still believes in Santa. The old man in the wheelchair plays Santa for her, James Dunn and all his buddies play Santa for her. Even the cook (Jane Darwell) and the butler are up to the task of playing Santa for her and providing her with a home if necessary.We are surrounded by a gift of love in this film.

Again it is not a Christmas story, but it does takes place at Christmas. This film is also a perfect example of the sweet, kind, and adorable curly-topped little girl, that endeared Shirley Temple to the Depression-era audiences of the 1930s. She sings her famous trademark song  On The Good Ship Lollipop  in Bright Eyes, and deals with the snobby, spoiled brat character, that Jane Withers plays so convincingly. Shirley Temple would never be upstaged again by another child in any of her other films. Another scene stealer in this movie, is Charles Sellon, who is wonderful to watch as the cranky Uncle Ned Smith, who softens so sweetly towards Shirley. A very tender scene takes place Christmas eve, when Shirley says her prayers with her mother, and she hangs the longest stocking on her bedpost. Christmas morning, the happy child excitedly tells Mrs. Higgins ( Jane Darwell ) the housekeeper what Santa Claus brought her, meanwhile bratty Jane is seen tearing through her presents. James Dunn has a prominent and important part in this story, and it's always a delight to watch his scenes with Temple. Unfortunately, in this story the mother is struck by a car and killed, which maybe a difficult moment for little children to understand. But as in all Shirley Temple films, a happy ending always prevails. Bright Eyes is one of those endearing stories, that continues to deliver pure entertainment. "},{"Title":"Sugar and Spice.....","Date":"27 February 2016","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":" Bright Eyes is a film that probably made Shirley Temple go to that height of her career by performing her iconic song The Good Ship Lollipop And like the song, the plot, the acting and just Shirley---are so sweet you just may get diabetes watching the film.Not to say that this type of diabetes is not enjoyable. It just fits into Shirley's character. Shirley (yes, that is her character's name) is an adorable Lil moppet whose attractive mother works as a maid for a snotty family named Smith (Please! pronounce it as Smythe!) I think I heard the person who wrote the screen play based this story while growing up, the Scottish maid in his home had a sweet little daughter about Shirley's age. Shirley's deceased father who was a pilot, died in a crash. But not to worry---His father's friends, especially best friend Loop treat Shirley as their own daughter by showering her with attention and presents. Sweet, unspoiled Shirley is surrounded by other love--The Smith's family invalid uncle who is charmed by the little girl as well as the servants and Loop's ex-girlfriend.You know the sugar-now here is the spice. The Smith's daughter, Joy played beautifully by Jane Withers is a Super Brat! But such a brat that you'll love the performance that she unintentionally steals some scenes from Temple. It was said that Jane Withers got the part of Joy because she could make the noise of a machine gun.Then,tragedy strikes! Shirley's Mom is killed in an accident. And during the joyful season of Christmas as well....Now, poor Shirley is an orphan. What will become of Shirley? Who will adopt her? So, if you need a little sugar, Sail abroad the Good Ship Lollipop and prepare to tug at your heart strings. "},{"Title":"Shirley Temple on the Good Ship Lollipop","Date":"17 March 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":" Five-year-old Glendale, California tyke Shirley Temple (as Shirley Blake) hitch-hikes to the airport to visit her godfather pilot James Dunn (as James Loop Merritt). Not many kids could do that today. While she's away, we meet the curly top's family. She lives with mother Lois Wilson (as Mary Blake), who works as the maid for a wealthy family headed by another former silent film star, Theodor von Eltz (as J. Wellington Smythe). His snooty wife Dorothy Christy (as Anita) decides to fire mother Wilson for receiving too many telephone calls. However, their obnoxious but deep-down softie uncle Charles Sellon (as Ned Smith) likes Ms. Temple. He calls her Bright Eyes. The illustrious cast includes servants Jane Darwell and Brandon Hurst. But the most memorable member of the household is Ms. Temple's antithesis &#x96; the classic spoiled brat character played by Jane Withers (as Joy Smythe). She decapitates dolls and terrorizes wheelchair-bound uncle Sellon from her tricycle...Bright Eyes was a very successful early vehicle for Temple. The cartoon-like film captures all of her adorableness. Temple sings On the Good Ship Lollipop with the girlish innocence (some say sexuality) of a bygone era. Her amateurish vocals balance the perfect doll-like looks. The film has all the subtext depression-weary audiences loved &#x96; most importantly, undeserving and insufferable rich characters are put in their place by the angelic, suffering poor. Temple won an Academy Award for her cumulative work in 1934; this film has been mentioned as the one most responsible for bringing her the juvenile acting award, but contemporary reviews and research give the honor to Little Miss Marker (1934). In the earlier film, The New York Times rated Temple's performance higher than co-star Adolphe Menjou. Until the end of the decade, Temple would play variations of her Bright Eyes character, ringing up box office cash registers like no other child star, before or since.****** Bright Eyes (12/20/34) David Butler ~ Shirley Temple, James Dunn, Jane Withers, Charles Sellon "},{"Title":"A Little but Bright Film!","Date":"3 March 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":" Shirley Temple is at it again, stealing everyone's heart. Her mother works for some snooty people in this film called Bright Eyes. The only one in the household who likes her is the old man, Grandfather, who nicknamed her Bright Eyes, hence the name of the film. His daughter and son-in-law are only nice to him for his money and really want nothing to do with him and nothing to do with Shirley. They reluctantly hired her mother as a maid. James Dunn plays a flier and is friends with Shirley and her mother, due to the fact he was good friends with Shirley's father before he died in a plane accident. James Dunn, a frequent costar in Shirley's movies, visits them a lot, and the uppity lady of the house doesn't like such riffraff in the house and told her maid that if these flier people don't stop visiting, she'll have to find work elsewhere. But everything takes a dramatic turn just before Shirley's birthday party. If you're looking for the film where Shirley sings On the Good Ship Lollipop, then you've found it. In fact, it's a highlight in an otherwise routine Shirley Temple film. Not that it's a bad film; it's just not terribly original or different than most Shirley Temple movies. But Ms. Temple's sweet smile and the supporting cast of characters played by capable actors help buoy this film into an enjoyable little film for about 75 minutes. "}]
