Sure, it is cute enough for kids of all ages-- but it is also meaningful and real for adults, even if it might be best enjoyed as an allegory or fable. The scenes are beautiful, and the cinematography is amazing, in the stunning Japanese naturalist style. The story is bold and loving; I found humor, interest, and positive encouragement and -- dare I say it so cornily? -- life lessons. Because it is so charming, as well as entertaining, I found it to be an excellent date video! The kind of women I am attracted to most, tend to find this movie (at least for one viewing) a pleasant alternative to regular fare. I rate it a solid 10, and recommend it to adults--  You'll enjoy it!

Milo and Otis is one of the few films of all time that cannot be classified into any genre. It is a film meant for all, a true celebration of life. If you have a heart, which you all do, then you will deeply feel this celebration. It's emotional and spiritual level cannot be surpassed or defined.Some shallow people get turned off because they think the animals have been hurt. If you only knew Masanori Hata's life. He has his own island, Hakkaido, where he spent 4 or 5 wonderful years loving and viewing these animals behaviors, and is one of the biggest animal lovers of all time. Why would he put these animals in harm's way, him of all people? I would worry more about Hollywood films than him, because he is such a deep, devoted person to all animals. Watch this film, young or old, and you will be touched in a very genuine way. It truly is a celebration of life. Watch for symbols of all sorts and be led into this unhindered, unpredictable, and yet insecure and innocent loving world. This story will take you to that special place and invite you to experiance life, and will as assuredly inspire and move you. See for yourself...

Milo and Otis, best friends since birth, grow up on a small farm and lightheartedly enjoy their youth together, having fun with the other animals and playing games, their favorite being hide-and-seek.  One day, Milo finds the perfect hiding spot in a box tied to a pier on the river, but the game turns serious when the box starts to float downriver away from the farm.  Otis, loyal friend that he is, runs alongside the box, trying to help Milo, but eventually, the two animals are separated and lost from home.  The movie follows the two animals on their quest to reunite and find their way home, as they tumble through exciting adventures and close calls. Directed by Masanori Hata, Koneko monogatari, to cite the film's original title, was produced and released in Japan in 1986, achieving box office success in the Asian country.  The film made its way to the United States and was released in 1989 by Columbia Pictures.  The American edition is 76 minutes long, 14 minutes shorter than the Japanese version's 90 minutes. The American version is narrated with charm and enthusiasm by Dudley Moore, who creates distinct characters using nothing more than his voice. The film works on nearly all levels.  Although some heard-hearted adult viewers may find its plot simplistic and its humor childish, we must not forget that the film is, after all, a fable made for children.  That the movie speaks to an adult audience with respect and profundity is to its credit and an indication of its brilliance.  The cinematography by Hideo Fujii and Shinji Tomita captures the Japanese countryside beautifully, and the filmmakers show themselves to be masters of color and composition, depicting moments of true beauty such as the gentle trickling of water from a stalactite in a cave.  The film features a gentle instrumental score by Ryuichi Sakamoto that nicely complements the action.  The song Gonna Take a Walk Outside today by Michael Boddicker bookends the American version. Often compared to and, unfortunately, confused with the Disney film Homeward Bound The Incredible Journey, The Adventures of Milo and Otis is by far the superior film.  The Disney film also features animals (in this instance, two dogs and a cat) trying to make their way home.  The film surrounds this adventure home with an inane subplot involving the animals' owners (a family led by Robert Hays), who are searching for their lost pets. The Disney film lacks any subtlety or charm, dragging its animal heroes (voiced by Sally Field, Michael J. Fox, and Don Ameche) through sappy moments of forced  sentimentality and contrived plot developments.  Whereas Homeward Bound features plain cinematography and lacks the ambition to speak to an older audience or comment on real issues, The Adventures of Milo and Otis strongly addresses topics like loyalty and friendship.  Never pandering to its audience, the film even depicts the tension and jealousy that can arise between friends who become distanced when a love interest develops for one of them.  Although the Disney film was released with greater publicity and fanfare, The Adventures of Milo and Otis, a hidden gem, is far better. The Adventures of Milo and Otis is a simple fable and its characters exist in a magical world that seems untouched by human civilization. Although Milo and Otis live on a farm, their masters are never referred to or seen, nor is there any sign at all of humankind.  A locomotive that nearly runs Milo down represents the only existence of humanity in the film, a possible comment on the lethal power of technology and the destructive side of human nature.  By depicting cooperation and friendship between animals (some of which are natural enemies), the film seems to set their interaction as an example to us  quarrelsome humans.  However, let us not drift from the film's central theme.  Above all, The Adventures of Milo and Otis is a wonderful film about the enduring qualities of loyalty and friendship and, as such, is entertaining for younger and older viewers alike.

Unfortunately, the battered and overused VHS tape on which I had initially watched the film had, for years, been tragically misplaced, and so I'd never had an opportunity to relive the joys and wonders of a film I'd loved for so long. Luckily, however, whilst browsing through a table of children's DVDs at a store, I happened upon this familiar title, and so I wasted no time in snatching it up and purchasing it. Time and maturity, it seems, has done little to dilute the absolute cinematic magic of this extraordinary film.Originally a darker Japanese film entitled 'Koneko monogatari A Kitten's Story / The Adventures of Chatran,' the extensive 400,000 feet of footage from one-time director Masanori Hata was taken by Columbia Pictures and completely changed, trimmed (from 90 to 76 minutes) and Westernised into the adorable children's tale of a cat named Milo and his canine best friend, Otis. Whilst the Japanese version &#150; a huge box office success in its home country &#150; had been narrated by Shigeru Tsuyuguchi, British comedy actor Dudley Moore helmed the American version, providing the voices for all the creatures in the film. Notably, 'The Adventures of Milo and Otis' doesn't contain a single human actor, though we certainly do see traces of human habitation, most noticeably in a train and in Milo and Otis' beloved farmhouse.The film begins at the aforementioned farm, with a pregnant feline mother giving birth to a litter of cats in the upper floor of the barn. One young kitten, Milo, proves himself to be more adventurous and troublesome than his siblings, and an unexpected tumble from the barn loft sees him meeting a young pug puppy by the name of Otis. There is an oddly-touching moment when Otis announces himself to be not a cat, but a dog. Milo tentatively replies, but... deep down inside, we're all cats, right? Despite being of stereotypically opposing species, Milo and Otis form a life-long friendship, becoming the best of companions and accompanying each other on their numerous exciting adventures. One day, however, during their favourite game of hide-and-seek, Milo jumps into a wooden box beside the jetty, and it is suddenly swept downriver by the current. Otis, seeing his friend in distress, does his best to help, but he is not quick enough to prevent Milo from drifting further and further away from the farmhouse. As the uneasy cat begins to stray into scarily unfamiliar territory, he faces an array of difficult adversities &#150; including a hungry bear, a flock of seagulls, a venomous snake and a cavernous pit &#150; though he can always rely on the fact that his good pal Otis will always be in hot pursuit, despite his own share of potentially hazardous situations.Contrary to what some have commentated, 'The Adventures of Milo and Otis' is most certainly a children's film at heart, with a wonderful message of dedication, loyalty and friendship. Perhaps some parents may feel tentative about the scene in which both Milo and Otis' female companions give birth to litters of youngsters; however, it's hardly graphic or obscene in any real way, successfully translating, I thought, the wonder of life and birth. The footage, which was filmed over four years, breathtakingly captures the splendour of the Japanese countryside, containing countless truly inspired moments of photography from cinematographers Hideo Fujii and Shinji Tomita. The lovely field of blossoms, where the kind-hearted doe teaches Milo to frolic, springs straight to mind as a particularly memorable moment. Additionally, adults should also enjoy the narration from Dudley Moore, whose gentle voice and subtle humour speaks to both kids and adults. There is also that infectious theme tune, Walk Outside, written by Dick Tarrier and performed by Dan Crow.It is unfortunate that a continuous spate of controversy has slightly tarnished this lovely film's name. It is not uncommon to come across completely unfounded claims that animals were tortured and even killed during the making of the film. After carrying out some research of my own, I can find absolutely no substantiated evidence to support these allegations, most of which were probably concocted based on a single viewing of the film. Indeed, there are moments during 'The Adventures of Milo and Otis' when our favourite animal characters appear to be in potentially dangerous situations. Rather than being evidence of clear cruelty, it would be more accurately described as clever film-making. It is often remarkable to realise how effectively carefully-chosen camera angles, quick cuts, slow-motion and trained animals can be used to create the illusion of mortal peril.Additionally, the closing credits proclaim that the animals used were filmed under strict supervision with the utmost concern for their handling. Though some have affirmed that these titles explicitly avoid the use of the term no animals were harmed, I venture that this phrase was never of customary-use until after 1989, the year of the film's US release. Unfortunately, the American Humane Association has not issued an animal cruelty review for the film, which would have finally put an end to all the heated debate. Contrary to what some have stated, my humble research has discovered that director Masanori Hata was a respected zoologist who owned a private animal farm near Hokkaido. Also taking into account the large time-span over which 'Milo and Otis' was filmed (in many cases, Hata simply let his animal actors roam free and filmed their natural actions), it seems unlikely that such an animal-lover would allow any of his mammalian friends to come to harm. I regret that so much of my review has been dedicated to such a grim topic, since this is truly a remarkable children's movie, brimming with wonder and magic that is sure to inspire all who see it.

Every scene includes some horrible thing done to the animal 'actors' in order to get a particular shot. Cats and dogs thrown off cliffs into ocean breakers, riding down whitewater rivers in a box, chased by predators, shaking and wet and caked in snow... it really is a nonstop montage of abusive scenes. The movie was filmed in Japan so it did NOT have the American standard of animal supervision, and it is interesting to note that the disclaimer at the end does NOT say that no animals were harmed.I would never want  my son to think that it was ok to treat animals this way, nor would I want to support the film industry in making films this way. The animals in this movie had no idea that it was all just pretend nor did they give consent. They probably thought they were about to die any number of times during the filming, and that is assuming that none did die, which I'm not too sure of.I think it is important to consider the moral ramifications before viewing this movie or showing it to children.

All of the above means that adults should enjoy this as much as the kids. There is nothing offensive in this nothing....nothing.Dudley Moore's storytelling narration is a bit annoying in the beginning but settles down and is just fine, even humorous in spots.

Stuntmen and women have the free will and prerogative to perform in movies or not. Animals do not have the same choice. By virtue of the fact that animals can't drive themselves to auditions or to the movie set, it should be clear that OWNERS, not ANIMALS made the decisions to be in this and other movies. The comparison is inane.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie as a young teen, but recognize now that the price undoubtedly paid by these animals was not worth 90 minutes of viewing enjoyment. If you choose to be entertained by a story of friendship between species, go to your local ASPCA and adopt a cat and a dog. The bond will be genuine, and the amusement value will last much longer than 90 minutes and you'll be promoting compassion to animals rather than abuse and mistreatment.

There were numerous allegations of animal cruelty made against the movie makers when the film was released. Including claims from crew members that 20 or so kittens were killed during the filming. Even if these aren't true, anyone watching the movie can see that these animals were mistreated. The scene where the kitten is being attacked by a swarm of seagulls, the kitten in the river, and of course the aforementioned cliff scene all show a heartless mistreatment of animals.

I say some scenes because there is a huge number that are very disturbing. Now, I can't prove if indeed multiple cats and pugs were killed. It wouldn't surprise me considering the time it was filmed, animal rights were far less of an interest back then, and certain scenes like the kitten falling off a cliff sure seem to be life endangering. At the same time I heard the guy who produced this film was an animal lover who had an island that was a sort of sanctuary for animals. This of course doesn't prove much, we do know stories of animal support organizations that were guilty of killing animals or not giving them enough care, but it does give one some hope that animals didn't get killed. Still, even if we assume those are just rumors there are too many scenes where animals are in obvious distress. The one where the cat is attacked by seagulls is a great example. This ruined a movie a lot for me. I sure hope there has been a greater progress with animal treatment on the movie set.

Their lives on the farm have already been a Biology 101 class as they learned about other creatures of the world, and they are certain to be experts by the time their adventure is finally over. Through the narration of Dudley Moore, Milo the cat and Otis the pug come to life, having been friends almost since birth. Singer Dan Crow gives the American version of the Japanese film an authentic feel with the Oscar worthy song that opens and concludes the movie. Enjoyable for children to see nature at work (without even the appearance of one human or computer generated effects) and for adults (as the conclusion is far more mature oriented with a surprising twist in the story), this is destined to become a classic, if it hasn't already.Between the various barnyard animals (cows, ducks, sheep, etc.), there are other farmyard locals of the wilder kind (deer, raccoons, a hedgehog), and when they are off on their adventure, they encounter animals both friendly and dangerous. A cute fox romps around playfully and teases Otis for being a dog without a tale; Milo finds comfort from a friendly fawn, a wise old owl and a poor little piglet who is ten times more adorable than Babe. He's threatened by both a bear cub and a curious snake while Otis ends up feeling dejected when the maturing process in young mammals makes him feel he's no longer welcome in Milo's life. As the seasons change, so do animal's lives, and a beautiful winter setting moves the film towards a touching conclusion.Some of the situations the two pals encounter are certainly far-fetched, but thanks to the way the story is presented and through its innocent charm, Milo and Otis is a film about the magic of friendship of two animals who are supposed to be natural enemies. Sometimes nature disputes this myth, even though sometimes cats and dogs seem to fight only to make the humans in their lives believe in something that isn't really true. So the next time you take a walk outside today, observe nature in its finest where beauty so delightfully colorful can really make a difference in a world obsessed with artificiality.

One day, Milo is playing in a box on the river that is swept downstream into the rapids, prompting Otis to follow him in a desperate attempt at rescue. Milo escapes into unfamiliar territory, with Otis right behind, and so begins a series of adventures that takes them both all over the place, through all kinds of weather, as they both meet their mates and have families of their own... Charming film is well-narrated by Moore, in a funny yet straight-forward manner.

People typically imagine Chance, Shadow and Sassy from Homeward Bound The Incredible Journey. There is, however, another film in which a farm cat and a pug embark on a journey all their own. The Adventures of Milo and Otis (1986) is a heartwarming story of a pug, Otis, who sets out to find his lost cat friend, Milo.Before examining this film in further detail I will acknowledge the controversy behind this movie. The living animals used in this film were put through some extremely dangerous situations. Any time the director sends a cat over a waterfall in a wooden box it is sure to get some animal cruelty charges. Despite what I may believe about whether or not there was animal abuse on the set of this movie, I still rate this film as I would any other film.Only one actor was used in the film (not including animals). Dudley Moore did the voice over work including narration and character voices. Exquisite voice work keeps the film moving smoothly. Each character had a distinct voice, and the inflection in the voice made the narration interesting. With limited amount of voices the music is an imperative addition to keep the audiences attention. The music fits the tone of the story although at times it does become repetitive. The cinematography is done well. The camera angles and pans allow the story to flow smoothly and effortlessly. A smart script offers genuine emotion with drama and comedy mixed flawlessly.Despite repetitive music and the thought of animal abuse, the movie is very well edited and put together. The entertainment value for children is very high. The playful feel of the movie will hold the attention of the entire family.

The footage consists of animals naturally interacting with one another which make it very enjoyable and even peaceful. The narrator does a good job in this movie narrating the story as well as doing all the voices for the characters. PROS/CONS Being that it is just animal footage (and sometimes feels as though it is randomly jumps from something to the next), makes the movie lag a lot.

The reworked version in English language is apparently from 1989. Milo and Otis is a cute animal film. Another one of the great animal films.The story is about the friendship of a curious orange tabby kitten named Milo and a mature fawn Pug named Otis. Our small friends live separate adventures and confront separate dangers in a Homeward Bound-like story. During this journey, Otis's aim is to search for Milo, find him and rescue him from potential sticky situations.The film is narrated in a somewhat unusual way, but this narration proves to be effective and pleasant. The very same narration is made in a semi-comical way in many scenes. Dudley Moore does an interesting narration work.Following the tradition of the great animal films, this one also offers beautiful landscapes. It's all natural and pure a farm, green places, mountains, sea, rivers, sand and others. If this really takes place in Japan, then I must say that Japan is a beautiful country, actually more than I ever imagined.I've already owned two orange tabby cats in the past. One of them was named Tiger because these cats look like tigers in miniature. Little Milo reminds me of these cats.Milo is cute. As for Otis, he is cute too. Pugs are not gorgeous dogs but they're cute. Plus, they are friendly, fond of people and even of other animals. Also, they've got that sad, worried and tender look on their face.This should definitely be on Top 250.

They met as soon as they were born and became best friends. Milo was known for getting into trouble most of the time. In fact, it was one afternoon while he was trying to be clever that lead he and Otis on the biggest adventure of their lives.               It began when Milo tried hiding from Otis in a crate tied to the pier. What Milo didn't suspect is that the rope came undone and he was carried away by the stream. Otis tried to catch him but had to deal with a huge grizzly bear. Well, after going down a giant waterfall and dismounting the crate, Milo wandered off on his own. That night, Milo avoided screech owls and befriended a family of pigs and narrowly escapes being run over by a train. Otis makes friends with a sea turtle and wonders if he'll ever find his feline friend again. He does when he rescues Milo from an enormous pit he had fallen into. The friends were together again and nothing would come between them again--except for a female cat named Joyce. Milo and Joyce hit it right off. Poor Otis felt left out. Milo suggested they follow the river home but Otis decided to take the mountain route. He ran into snowy weather along the way and met a female pug named Sondra. They also hit it right off and soon give birth to three puppies. Milo does too- kittens that is. Then the families met up together and headed home.                  A nice story. Very well narrated by Dudley Moore who sadly is no longer with us. He met his demise in 2002. But if you're a fan of cats and dogs and you like movies about when animals talk and must make it home from great distances, then I recommend this movie.

I'm not saying that no animal was ever harmed on any other shooting that this one, but there's a difference between a horse with a broken leg and five cats thrown from a cliff until one survives and the sequence is wrapped up. (I'm not making this up.) Watching Chatran is like witnessing scientific experiments on animals with the medics laughing their heads off in the background. Except here, the only goal is to make money. The ultimate hypocrisy is that it's supposed to be a charming and moving story with big moral issues about life... To think that the director of this thing is one of the most talented and popular writers in Japan really has me wondering. A sickening experience of cinematographic lobotomy. Blindness is dangerous.

Koneko Monagatari? We always just called it Otis and Milo! I loved this very much as a kid, but then it vanished on me and it was about 15 years before I was finally able to see it again. I fully expected to be hit by waves of sweetest nostalgia, but what I got was more of a cold shower. I found it very childish. I still liked it, but didn't love it as I once did. Of course, nothing's ever as good as you remember, but there are still glimmers and moments that give me the old magic feeling. It's visually gorgeous, you do see incredible scenes and situations totally unique to it involving various species of animals. Generally all cute. My favourite one is the scene with the cat and doe in the field of cotton blossoms. The aching purity of the scene is so warm and beautiful, it's like a dream, or a little piece of heaven... It was the one part of the movie that remained vividly etched in my mind long after I'd forgotten pretty much everything else. It's positively sacred to me.  I really don't care for ignorant types who try and make out that those who enjoy this film are condoning animal abuse or something. I'm not saying their points aren't very valid, but in this case I believe they are very overblown and unnecessary. And to the reviewer who said that parents should consider the moral ramifications before showing the film to their kids, I damn well disagree with you. I watched plenty of times when I was about 7 or 8 and it never made me want to do anything bad to any animals. I think that parents need only have that concern if it were people harming the animals in the picture. Everything scary that happens is portrayed as the natural peril of their journey. This movie's completely harmless. So I think all people like you need to just lay of the sweet little children's movie and lighten the hell up! I'm sorry, if any animals did get hurt, but I never saw this film that way before and I'm not going to start now. You people aren't gonna taint my memories of this film. I see beauty, innocence and hope. That's all I see. The only thing I really dislike is how much of a child's movie it really is. That, and Dudley Moore's damn ceaseless narration, he's really quite annoying! He's almost patronising. I don't think there are any big life lessons to be learned here, it's just a nice little picture for children, and really nothing more. If it has a big failing, that's it. I also hate that stupid song.  This movie has great sentimental value for me. To me sentimental value is when you don't particularly love something to death, but for whatever reason, you always want to know it's close by, and that's how I feel about this movie now. I thought one review was very sweet and apt in it's description of this-that of a bedtime story. Sweet precious little bedtime story that's very much worthy of remembering, and hopefully for its more positive and uplifting aspects.

My two-year-old daughter picks it out to watch often. (Yep, she gets to choose her own movies out of our kid movie folder.) The kids love watching the movie for the interaction of Milo (the cat) and Otis (the dog) with each other and other animals. The movie is the tale of what happens to them for about the first year of their life. The narration (in America, by Dudley Moore) is sweet, silly, and full of drama (isn't that what life is?). It is geared toward a young audience, but parents may want to watch this one before letting their kids watch. If you are a conservative parent, parts of it might bother you. I found that I know what my kids can understand and what they can't. Parents are the best ones to know whether this movie is OK for their kids. Some might not want to have to explain certain elements (i.e. kitten/puppy birth). They show everything. (I wanted to write this without it being a possible spoiler, but I was surprised by the graphic nature of the birth sequences. You might be, too.)

I saw it somewhat often until I made the transition that all typical males make from the cute family movies to the shoot-em-up action movies as I grew up. Now I'm 17 years old, and I saw the movie again, and I think I actually enjoyed it even more than when I was a kid. While teenage males are probably the least likely people to want to watch this sort of thing, it just goes to show you that as long as you see it with an open mind, this movie, albeit short, will take you on a ride of laughs and tears (and even some awwwww moments when the cute poses of the animals are shown).The best part about this movie is the good balance between funny, sad, and cute. Not one of these elements takes away from any other. Just because there are funny moments does not mean it makes the plot any less serious or emotional. Milo and Otis's friendship and perseverance is admirable and the viewer cannot help but love these two animals. The fact that this movie includes cute poses of the animals (i.e. Milo and Otis taking care of the egg while still at the farm) doesn't hurt either =).This movie is good for both kids and adults alike. If you are a kid, you will probably like this movie for it's humorous and tear-jerker moments alone. If you are an adult, you will enjoy this movie just as a kid would, but you will probably enjoy it even more because you can't help but appreciate all of the effort that went in to the making of this movie (which took 4 years), as well as the simpleness and enthusiasm of the narration.The reason I gave this movie a 9 and not a 10 is because I felt that at the end, they should've included an extra scene (with no narration/dialogue, maybe even as the music at the end was playing) of Milo and Otis and their families back at the farm (even if it was only for 30 seconds or so). If they had included an extra scene like such, I feel the movie would've had a more satisfying closure. Oh and speaking of music, the main theme song is clever and catchy.All in all, this is a great movie for any ages, and it just goes to show you that kids don't have to watch stuff like Spongebob Squarepants to really enjoy something. This movie is as close as you'll get to nature and peacefulness without actually visiting a river or whatever of your own with no humans around.9/10 "},{"Title":"Film Essay","Date":"13 December 2005","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Family","Review":" My opinion of this movie is that it is a great film. I loved the fact that only animals were acting in the movie and I just thought that was fantastic. I was very impressed with the director and other people who made this film because to go through hard work and train every animal to play their part would be very challenging. It seemed as if the animals were really talking to each other. I think that putting a dog and cat in the film and showing their friendship with one another kind of represents people also because a dog and a cat are completely opposite in the outside, but in the inside they can be exactly alike and have a lot in common just like a white person and a black person. Although they are a different race, they can still manage to be good friends. Looking different from the other person does not matter just as long as you have that special connection to become friends. Some strength of the film was that it showed some animals acting like they would be acting in reality. For example, the part with the fox. He was very picky about where to hide his food so that it would be safe from other animals. Also the part with the black bear, he was dangerous and violent towards Otis and that is the way bears really are in the wild. Some weaknesses were that some animals in the film did things that they wouldn't do in reality. For example, the part with the turtle when he noticed Otis stranded on a rock and needed help to get to land, so the big turtle helps him by letting Otis climb onto his shell and he swam back to shore. Also the parts with the deer sleeping with Milo and letting him sleep on her stomach. I don't think a deer would normally do that in real life. If I was to rate this film, I would rate it a 10 because it is great for kids and I believe that they can learn a lot from it. They can learn that friendship is a strong part of your life and if you believe that person is your true friend, you should never treat them bad and take them for granted. Stay true to them like they would be true to you.

The cinematography was breathtaking (filmed entirely in Japan over the course of 4 years), the storyline (the adventures of friends who are very different from each other and the lessons they learn in life) was universally heartwarming, the actors (only animals - humans would have been superfluous) were incredibly adorable, and Dudley Moore's narration was utter perfection.Disregard the negative reviews about the movie. No one ever seems to complain or shout when human stuntmen and women shoot dangerous scenes, nor when reality TV shows feature real people getting injured and/or killed for the sake of our entertainment. Animal actors are rewarded in the same way as human actors are, except animal currency is FOOD! Anyone who has their own menagerie (like the director) has to be an animal lover, which the director of this movie clearly is. A disclaimer at the end of the movie ensures that all animals were carefully supervised during the making of this movie. The more common No animals were hurt during the making of this movie could not be used because the American Humane Association (AHA) does not oversee non-American films.If you're looking for a movie that will delight you over and over again, make a beeline for The Adventures of Milo and Otis!

In fact, I'm a deer hunter. I shoot cute deer and watch them die. Then I cut them open and remove their organs. Then I cook and eat them.But I don't throw them 30 feet off a seaside cliff into the water, like the filmmaker did to Milo the cat. I don't allow a partially tamed bear to repeatedly duck them and hold them under water, like they did to Otis the dog. I don't make them fight with other animals, which happened more times than I can count.They put a cat in a box and floated him down a stream through rough water and over a waterfall. The animal is clearly terrified, and is almost always at the point of tipping the box over. I'm sure that box tipped over a lot. I'm also sure they did many, many takes of the rapids and waterfall scenes before they got the shots of the terrified cat they wanted (I understand this movie took 4 years to shoot).They threw the dog into the water several times. Apparently it hated water and couldn't be taught to jump in on its own. In one scene (on the dock) the board they use to tip the dog in is visible in the water next to him. In other scenes, they don't show the dog jumping in the water, just landing there after being thrown in. My dog Kiwi loves the water. This dog obviously does not and is terrified. Watch how it swims with its head almost straight up in the air, trying to stay out of the wet. It's a very exhausting way for a dog to swim, and just about the point where the filmmaker sics the bear on him.The movie has a nice story, and some scenes are quite entertaining (the stuff with the fox in particular). But it makes me angry seeing those animals abused in the process. I wish we hadn't bought this movie and supported the cruel people who made it. "},{"Title":"I'm so upset!!

The only speaking is the narration from Dudley Moore, who narrates it like a story with the film alongside. In this film, Milo and Otis, a cat and a dog, are best friends from the very first time they meet. At first things are fine and dandy, but what happens if the naughty Milo goes TOO far..?I like this film because of Milo and Otis themselves, Milo is an orange cat and Otis is a pug. Dudley Moore does such a GOOD job. He is so entertaining, I can't understand why people would rate this one out of ten because of other reasons and not rate it two instead because of DUDLEY MOORE! ) The Japanese scenery is also very beautiful, filmed in areas where humans hardly ever go (there are no humans shown in this film). I also love watching this because of the nostalgia (I have grown up with this film) and the emotion expressed. I recommend this to people who love animals, people who love Dudley Moore and his humour! Enjoy! -)P.S WARNING Some people may mistake this film as being very cruel because it sometimes looks like it. I really hope the humans didn't put the animals into this mess on purpose, but that the animals did it themselves. So blame the animals when you watch it if it disturbs you.

I mean people make a big deal over the fact that a cat was throw off a ten foot cliff and landed in water. I saw the look on on the animals faces and they were doing fine. Some animals might have been hurt, but people are hurt in movies all the time, so it is going to happen to animals somtime or another.As a person who knows animals it is a fact that if animals are abused during somthing like a movie shoot they will not perform. So think about that next time you want to crap on the movie.But anyway it was a true classic movie about friendship between animals.

I was enjoying it very much until near the end.As far as the animal treatment controversy, i think a reviwer on Amazon pretty well debunks most of these concerns. Even in the 80s trick photography could do some pretty amazing things. I doubt any real harm was done to these animals. On the other hand, I am not sure standards in Japan in the 80s were what we would now expect, so I just have to reserve judgement.My complaint is one most people won't care about, but I do; the movie's heterosexism. Now I hate to be in turn a homosexist; I do not mean to disparage marriage or raising children in any way, because I do not feel that way. I also hate to take a simple children's story and make it so darn controversial. HOWEVER, For the first 3/4 of the movie Milo and Otis is about male friendship, bonding, and heroism for each other. Then out of the blue appears Joyce who has absolutely nothing to offer Milo other than being female. Otis, who just saved Milo's life, is out the window. Milo doesn't care. Otis is devastated and goes off into the bitter cold snowy mountains, possibly to die. Is that a message to send kids - dump your closest buddy who saved you just for a girl? I am not suggesting they were gay cats and dogs, but this kind of hetero supremacy would do James Dobson proud.Then it gets worse Otis, out in the mountain, meets a girl-dog, and now he understands what came over Milo. This about made me turn the thing off.I think it is fine to make a movie about animals getting married and having cute kittens and puppies - i am all for it, but this ended up totally negating the whole feeling of the first hour of the movie. I don't object to Milo and Otis getting married but it should have been done very differently, and without such total disregard for each other, In the end, the deep bond between Milo and Otis, which I thought was what this movie was about, ends up being trivialized.If you can overlook this issue though, (I can't) and assuming no animals were hurt, Milo and Otis is certainly a very cute movie and heartwarming for the most part.

The narrator alone completely destroys any entertainment value to be had at films of cute baby animals.The baby animals have an unbelievable adventure involving animals that I don't believe are even all native to the land. But that small continuity error aside, even if there were that many diverse species all living so close to one another it's impossible to believe that these animals would run into so many in just one day.In addition, there are scenes that may not be suitable for children that show cruelty to animals. While this isn't the main reason I don't like the movie, it adds to the whole effect.

Such was the success of the picture that an English version was produced a year later, with Dudley Moore relating the story of Milo and Otis.First and foremost this is a children's film, targeting that audience almost exclusively, leaving little value for adult viewers. Against Babe, this flick pales, with the recent Oz smash being of course a much more adult story.Dudley Moore is hardly 'the man with a thousand voices', and must have been desperate for work to have taken this on. My mother narrates better than old Dud, who should perhaps stick to on screen performances. Still these Adventures of Milo and Otis are fun, and most not expecting outstanding entertainment will enjoy this short little frolic through the Japanese countryside.Questionable is the treatment of the animals at times, as they are exposed to harsh snow, treacherous rivers and the occasional nasty critter. On these occasions they don't appear to be enjoying themselves, and animal lovers may not either.Mercifully short, it shouldn't be too hard for the kids to stay tuned to this for the duration (76 mins.), and the little tykes are sure to enjoy it thoroughly. For the older 'kids' there are a few laughs but not much more, apart from the clever animal wrangling and the sharp cinematography which captures some memorable images of rural Japan.Saturday, January 27, 1996 - T.V.

This is very similar to the Disney Homeward Bound series of movies except that each animal doesn't have it's own individual voice. All the voices are handled by one person, Mr. Moore. This works because of his ability to change his voice very effectively especially in one case where he does a female cat that you'd swear isn't him. Another difference is that this story lasts thru many seasons with the pup & kitten becoming mom & dad and having families. This is a very safe film that won't frighten younger viewers and teaches them a little about life, which is definitely a plus as well.

At one point the gulls attacks the cat who does the best acting job I've ever seen, because he looks so scared that he runs around in circles trying to get away from the gulls.  That's not entertainment that is torture. This movie could have been made with animation or in the vain of one of those terrible Disney flix like Homeward Bound and still maintained its plot, its theme, and its merit.

They tough the cold winter out in separate places and soon have kittens and pups of their own and eventually hook up and head back to their farm as one big happy family.I have always liked this film. It had Dudley Moore narrate it and he did a great job. Kids will love this and its fun for adults. Its rather cute at times especially the way these animals love each other. The direction wasn't bad and the little journey is nice to watch.Of course the film is rather flawed and very hard to buy, but its cute none the less.
