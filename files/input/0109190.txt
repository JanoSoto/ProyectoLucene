Dumb characters are even easier.  But when you get a movie that is so endearingly, goofily dumb as Baby's day Out, you can't help but love it!The plot is straight out of Cartoon Land, with a low bow in the Three Stooges' direction compliments of scripter John Hughes (surprise!).  Three of the dimmest kidnappers in history (Mantegna, Pantoliano and Haley) make the mistake of kidnapping a rich couple's little baby, who turns out to be far more resourceful than all three of them combined.  And a lot more ruthless.During the course of the day, baby Bink (Warton and Warton) leads the dumb bad guys throughout the width and breadth of Chicago and leaves them all bruised, beaten, burnt, plummeted from innumerable high drops and otherwise humiliated (we've had the living hell torn out of us by a baby, screams Mantegna at one point).  And all the while, we're laughing.I saw this in the theatre when it first came out and, I must admit, the entire packed-in audience was laughing hysterically at every single pratfall, gag and slapstick business that occurred.  I love this kind of movie and seeing the great Joe Mantegna take his lumps so valiantly brings a smile in itself.It's nice to play dumb once in a while.  And even nicer to witness it.Eight stars for Baby's Day Out.  If you like such laughs, it'll make your Day.

It's basically Home Alone out on the streets and with a baby instead of a small boy.A baby goes wandering all over the big city with two kidnappers chasing it. People are everywhere but nobody sees the baby but the bad guys?! Hey, I told you it made no sense, but there are so many laughs in here, so many goofy slapstick routines that work that it's worth your time to check it out. I've seen it a couple of times and throughly enjoyed it each time, as have my guests - from kids to older folks.To movie buffs, it's kind of fun also to see Joe Pantoliano and Joe Mantegna playing roles in which profanity is at a minimum, and they are in it only for laughs. It's a long way from most of their roles. Mantegna is especially impressive with his comedy. I was shocked how funny he was.The only criticism I had, other than totally preposterous story being a little too far-fetched, is that one scene (at the construction site) went on too long. The movie as a whole would have been better had it been cut about 15 minutes. It's basically a one-joke movie and 99 minutes is too long for that.Overall, this is a nice entertainment with a lot of laugh-out-loud scenes. If you get a kick out of seeing a baby constantly laugh, giggle and have a great time, then you'll really love this.

It's a pity this was released on the coattails of Home Alone, since it's inevitably perceived as a knock-off. But the comparison is really unfair. Home Alone featured McCauley Culkin as annoying, precocious, and self-sufficient far beyond his years. The criminals who were his foils were reminiscent of The Three Stooges in their ineptitude. The one quality both Culkin and the criminals shared was a being mean spirited to some degree.Baby Bink in Baby's Day Out is a true innocent who survives on luck while remaining adorably unaffected. His criminal foils are more reminiscent of Laurel & Hardy than The Three Stooges - cleverer and more subtle. In this case, the quality shared by Baby Bink and the criminals is innocence and an underlying decency.The supporting cast is superb, led by Joe Mantegna in one of his best comic roles.If you're not too jaded to appreciate it, I highly recommend this movie.

However his mother hires a famous photographer to take his picture.  However when the photographers arrive they are actually kidnappers who steal away baby Bink and demand a ransom.  However Baby Bink manages to slip out of their sight and begins a journey through the city of his story book.  The kidnappers try to catch him but seem to be always one step behind.John Hughes won't be remembered in the same way as &#145;great' filmmakers will be - but like it or not, he knows how to do this type of film with his eyes closed.  This never gets above the same cartoon humour of Home Alone, but it still manages to be very funny.  The story is daft - the baby going through the city by recognising things from his story book, however the cartoon humour is very good throughout.  Some scenes (with the worried mother) and the ending can't help but lapse into sentiment, but for the most part it's sheer comedy antics.The reason the comedy works is not due to the baby - he is cute but he never dominates the way Mulcaly Culkin did, instead he haplessly crawls his way around using `baby luck'.  What makes it work are three really funny performances from the kidnappers.  One of my favourite actors Joe Mantegna is usually above this type of stuff, but he's really funny here.  Similarly Joe Pantoliano has been in his share of blockbusters and is funny here with Haley.  The support cast has it's fair share of famous faces - Boyle is lumbered with all the emotional scenes and Matthew Glave (The Wedding Singer) doesn't have much to do.  An uncredited Mike Starr as an informant, Fred Dalton Thompson as the cop, Cynthia Nixon (Sex and the City) as the nanny and Anna Levine (Bad Boys, Unforgiven, The Crow) as an understanding mother make interesting appearances.  However when the kidnappers are off the screen things aren't as good and start to drag.Overall you know what to expect from this.  If you're in the mood for Tom & Jerry style cartoon humour (as opposed to Jerry & Tom humour - Mantegna fans will understand!) then this is a really good laugh.  Simple, unmemorable but fun!

He lives with his adoring parents, Bennington and Laraine, in a big house. His most favorite book in the whole world was Baby's Day Out, which he calls his Boo-Boo Book, because the story is about a baby named Baby Boo and the story is about Baby Boo and his nanny going into town, ride a bus, visit a department store, then the zoo, and so on.        Baby Bink was getting his picture taken today and instead of hiring Old Willie, their normal photographer, they decided to try a different place. But right then, three bumbling thugs, Eddie, Norby and Veeko, tie up the photographers and take their places, for they knew Baby Bink belonged to a rich family and they planned to kidnap him and ransom him for an insane amount of money. They arrive at the house and pull off the crime with ease, then they take him to their hideout. They took along his book and Norby, illiterate, attempts to read it to him but it ends up putting him to sleep, so Bink crawled out the window and up on the roof. Eddie, Veeko and Norby soon discover he's missing and go out after him. Eddie falls off the roof in the process.       Laraine and Bennington spare no expense to have their son found. The FBI is on the case; Bink get's on board a bus, like the one in his book, then he enters a big department store while the crooks look over the bus. Next, Bink goes to the zoo. The crooks find him in the monkey house and run afoul of a grumpy mother gorilla. Finally, they chase him to a construction site. Norby falls in a vat of concrete, Veeko lands in the waste dispenser, and Eddie, suffering many mishaps, if left hanging on a crane. Finally, Bink goes to the Old Soldiers' Home where his family finds him! The police catch the crooks when they go to the hideout because Bink points out his book is there. So our story has a happy ending.      A pretty funny movie. It's written by John Hughes who brought us such memorable comedies as Home Alone and Uncle Buck. Joe Mantegna is Eddie, Lara Flynn Boyle is Laraine, Joe Pantoliano is Norby, Brian Haley is Veeko, Cynthia Nixon (who recently had a baby of her own) is Nanny Gilbertine, and Eddie Bracken (who sadly just died) has a cameo. Anyway, this was a good movie. There probably should've been a sequel like the ending suggests Bink pulls out his new favorite book Baby's Trip to China. Oh well. Anyway, I recommend Baby's Day Out. A movie to watch and be thankful on Thanksgiving this year.- "}{"Title":"Drink your bottle of milk and enjoy this predictable film.","Date":"13 January 1999","Score":"10 out of 19 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Crime","Review":"  If you remember that old TOM & JERRY cartoon about a baby who crawls out of home and onto the skyscraper, then chances are you know what to expect in BABY'S DAY OUT. After all, somebody finally had a way to translate a familiar and risky situation to the big screen, which is fine and dandy, tried and true. However, it duplicates itself as a hybrid of HOME ALONE all the way, as we've gotten used to booby traps, pitfalls, and other obstacles before. For a comedy, the cartoonish acting fits well for a movie that makes complete idiots suck on a patsy. The tiny toddler provides us a good time with his sense of wit and bravery in outsmarting the crooks and on his long journey back home. Not as bad as some people believed, but a lot of what's going on here is way too predictable. It's amazing why this one bombed the box office!

Lots of people must think that BDO is copying Baby Herman from Who Framed Roger Rabbit or a couple of Tom and Jerry shorts where the cat and mouse become allies by necessity and strive to protect a constantly wandering baby from disaster. Well, even before that, we have a couple of '50s and '60s Popeye cartoons with the same premise. Taking a break from gobbling spinach and pummeling Bluto, Popeye (usually at Olive's insistence) reluctantly agrees to baby-sit Swee'pea. Unfortunately, innocent Swee'pea has wandering tendencies and easily escapes Popeye's supervision. Swee'pea insouciantly crawls through town, with Popeye in hot pursuit. Of course, Swee'pea comes through all sorts of disasters (like falling girders, busy streets, fierce zoo animals) without a mark on him, but Popeye, who constantly saves the baby from being hurt, gets put through the wringer until (sometimes but not always) he remembers to eat the plant that gives him super abilities.As for BDO itself, it's an update of the above-mentioned cartoons, plus an amalgamation of the Home Alone movies and even a smidgen of O'Henry's short story The Ransom of Red Chief. Oh, and of course the typical Three Stooges short (by the way, I'm a bit amazed that the Stooges never did a short where they had to play frazzled guardians of wandering kids, or did they?) You have to suspend tons of disbelief to enjoy this movie, like for example baby Bink shuffling about with almost nobody noticing him except his would-be kidnappers (led by frustrated Joe Mantegna) or a gorilla cage with widely spaced bars that anybody can approach too closely and too dangerously. But once you suspend that disbelief, you'll have a slapsticky good time, especially if you like sweet babies. Just one warning of course the baby is never hurt, but the kidnappers suffer excruciating and shall we say, private injuries. Oh, well, block out the cartoonish pain too, and enjoy.

The priceless combination of slapstick violence and humour made a lasting impression on a lot of people, few more so (I suspect) than the late John Hughes. Feeling like a elongated Baby Hermann adventure, this movie (penned by Hughes) is possibly as close to a cartoon-style caper without the need for animation as we'll ever see. Trouble is, I'm not a kid anymore and this movie needed to provide more than a trio of dumb crooks to muscle its way into my heart.Little baby Bink (Adam & Jacob Worton) has got things pretty cushy. His maid (Cynthia Nixon) looks after him on behalf of his rich parents (Lara Flynn Boyle & Matthew Glave), who live in a big mansion somewhere out of town. But a trio of inept crooks (Joe Mantenega, Brian Haley and Joe Pantoliano) somehow kidnap Bink and hold him for ransom. Sadly for them, Bink escapes and leads them on a wild chase across the city. Surely it's not beyond the abilities of these losers to catch him again, is it? Baby's Day Out is not a film for critics, stacked to the rafters as it is with hammy performances, a deeply implausible plot and a strange feeling of deja vu, as if each set piece has been cut-and-pasted from somewhere else. But because the whole thing is so goofy from start to finish, you can't help but fall for its charms. Bink is horribly cute, laughing and gurgling on cue brilliantly well. As for the three stooges, they all perform with plenty of gusto and a knowing wink to the camera as though they know this is just paying the bills. There is also an unusual sense of reality to it, highlighted by the odd fact that almost nobody notices a baby crawling around a building site or a zoo except our little gang of would-be kidnappers. The ending also felt a bit of a let-down, especially when you realised the plot contrivance behind Bink's quest for freedom.It's certainly no classic but Baby's Day Out is an oddly enjoyable family film but one that only the really young will enjoy. It's as comic and sophisticated as a custard pie to the face and whether you'll enjoy the movie depends on how much you like this sort of stuff. I like my slapstick - I still get a kick watching Peter Sellers goof around in the Pink Panther movies - but I just felt something was missing from this. Think of it this way - imagine if the final, chaotic scenes from Home Alone were stretched out for ninety minutes. At what point do you stop finding the same joke funny? Baby's Day Out makes the most of its set-up but in truth, there wasn't much to make a whole film out of.

He recycles the 'Home Alone' formula yet again to produce this idiotic comedy in which a baby makes his way around Chicago while inept kidnappers Joe Mantegna, Joe Pantoliano and Brian Haley try to catch him, along the way enduring much tiresome slapstick. If Mantegna and Pantoliano can't find a laugh somewhere in your movie then you're in trouble, but it's not their fault they have nothing to work with.

Cartoon-like is the only way to explain the various blows the villains take (or dodge) during their attempts to get their kidnapping scheme to work. Their pratfalls become the stuff of legend once the movie reaches its climactic scene at a construction site where every imaginable pitfall is exposed--but always with Baby Bink emerging unscathed while the villains suffer their comic fate.It's the sort of film that must have looked good on paper, but in executing it there's no way to make any of it believable, at least for adults. Children will probably have a good time laughing at all of the pratfalls and near escapes that the baby has without being trampled on by cars or people.It's amusing enough and works as a comedy of errors. The villains are played skillfully by Joe Mantegna and Joe Pantoliano and the baby is priceless in all of his scene-stealing glory. Everyone else is more like a blank slate whenever the action returns to parental moments.Good for a few laughs, despite all the cartoon-like improbabilities.

The film is a cartoon devoid of the moralising one would expect in a children's film, concerned as it most obviously is so, with the fundamental laws of cause and effect (pretend you are a banana, be prepared to be attacked by a hungry gorilla). Even the baby is more aware of these universal principles than the villains, who spend the entirety of the film being assaulted by inanimate objects in the same manner as Wylie E Coyote. Like the aforementioned canine, the criminal's inherent badness and the nefariousness of their motives dictate their failure, no matter what form their actions may take. The two standout scenes are the fiery groin number (see choice dialogue above) and the zoo based action. Like much of the film (a 'tissue of quotations' indeed), the ending, set on a building site, borrows entirely from elements of popular culture, including the Donkey Kong video game and the Donald Duck cartoon 'The Riveter'.

At first glance, BABY'S DAY OUT could turn into a movie-of-the-week tragedy, but in the hands of John Hughes, the tables are turned with glorious hilarity.Playing like a Wile E. Coyote/Road Runner cartoon with criminals and a baby taking the respective places, it utilises simple scenarios throughout, but with rewarding moments of silliness that turn this into one of the most memorable comedies of the 1990's. It may not have made as much money as HOME ALONE 1 and 2, but it strikes an even funnier chord, thanks in part to the terrific performances of Joe Mantegna and Joe Pantoliano as the crooks who kidnap the baby in exchange for a $1 million ransom. The baby is the product of a high society couple (the wife played by Lara Flynn Boyle) who merely wanted their baby's picture taken. Simple, you might think. However, the baby's diminutive size proves to be a curse rather than a blessing and a series of incidents, notably involving a gorilla at the zoo and a building site which is reminiscent of some of the classic Laurel and Hardy two-reelers, more or less bring the chickens home to roost.Pure family entertainment and worth seeing for a good belly laugh if you are feeling down.

To be true I never expected something really good but I was surprised by how ridiculous and awful it was. What we have here is a bad Home Alone copy with a lost baby outside of his home instead of a young boy inside his home.So we're starting already with a suffocatingly trivial storyline. Then there comes a series of jokes which again are very ordinary. A lucky and smart baby makes fool of the, almost-stereotype, silly bad guys. A smart boss with two goofy partners find themselves in trouble trying to catch the baby! All these scenes not only are very unreal but they are not funny at all. Some reminded me of the death plans in Final Destination 3. For example there's a scene in a construction site where the three bad guys fall in traps a science fiction novelist would not imagine. And then the boss slips and falls down, gets smacked in the face by a flying hammer (what is so funny about that?) and then an extraterrestrial slime (which is very commonly found in construction sites) falls on him. Hmmm, I think I've seen that before in like 100 films.So we come to the ending where the wisdom wind strikes the baby's nanny and she finds out that the baby has followed the exact story as in a fairy tale she used to read to him. How touching!!! The happy ending comes and reassures the audience that there's absolutely nothing new and nothing funny at all. In my opinion this film is a loss of time.

The description appealed to them, and they ended up loving the movie.It's one of those movies that you either love or hate, not because of the quality of production or acting or script, but because you either like this kind of humor or you don't. More importantly, though, this is a nostalgia movie. It is NOT a baby version of Home Alone, but has it's roots back in the days of black and white cartoons, and people who didn't grow up watching the catch-the-baby-in-peril episodes of Tom and Jerry or Popeye cartoons are not as likely to enjoy this movie, which doesn't really have much more of a plot. However, if you DID love those old cartoons and don't mind the addition of multiple blows to the groin for the bad guys, this is a VERY well done live action version of that old art form, with a baby cute enough to inspire the same kind of Aaaaaw! reaction as produced by footage of fluffy kittens playing.

The fact that he wrote this 1994 family comedy adventure was how I discovered it just very recently, nearly seventeen years after it came out. It was made in my childhood, coming into theatres when I was nearly eight years old, but I never heard of it until probably earlier this year. The title and premise of Baby's Day Out suggest that the movie is pretty darn cheesy, and they certainly don't lie. While exploring Hughes' work in recent years, I've seen both good and not so good movies from the late filmmaker, and was expecting this to be one of the latter, which it sadly is.Baby Bink Cotwell lives in a mansion with his loving parents, Laraine and Bennington. His favourite bedtime book is Baby's Day Out, which his Nanny Gilbertine constantly reads to him. He is about to have his picture taken for the newspaper, but three con artists, Eddie, Norby, and Veeko, come to the mansion disguised as newspaper photographers, and when nobody else is looking, they kidnap the baby! They take Bink back to their apartment with them, but trying to control him turns out to be difficult. To try and get him to sleep, Norby reads him the Baby's Day Out book, but he ends up being the one who falls asleep instead, and Bink then manages to escape through the window. The kidnappers soon discover that he has escaped and go out to try and catch him. The baby crawls around through the city as the criminals pursue him, but as close as they often get, they can't seem to ever catch up to him! Meanwhile, FBI agents have come to help the Cotwells find their missing infant son.For a while, it looked like nothing here was going to tickle my funny bone at all, and I don't think this changed until the three antagonists get the baby to their apartment. These three characters aren't funny while they pose as photographers, but after this, they sure can be funny as they try to keep the baby under control and then pursue him in the streets. Their conflict is often the reason for this, and without these characters, I might have found Baby's Day Out to be one dull movie! However, even these criminal characters aren't always funny (it's still USUALLY straight-faced, even with all the screen time the antagonists have), and lots of unfunny things happen to them during their pursuit of Baby Bink. That doesn't exactly include the crotch-on-fire segment, though I'm not sure what I would have thought of that part as a kid. I guess a movie can have a ridiculous premise and still be entertaining, but I still didn't find the premise here too fascinating. In addition to being mostly unfunny, this is also a predictable film.Home Alone, the 1990 Christmas movie written and produced by John Hughes, turned out to be an amazingly high grossing blockbuster. I saw it for the first time just a couple years ago (though I definitely knew about it long before then), and if you ask me, that film certainly is overrated, but still better than this one. Baby's Day Out has a premise a lot like its far more popular predecessor, with a kid rivaling adult criminals who are in pursuit of him, only it's more extreme this time, with the kid being just a baby. I know many would disagree with me on this one, but I think this particular family adventure film doesn't have a lot of merit. It blends in with such other lacklustre 90's Hughes films as Flubber and the live action remake of 101 Dalmatians. Now, some people clearly LOVE this movie, and I don't look down on them for that, but I'm not expecting to ever come anywhere near being part of that crowd.

Without being a spectacular movie, let's be fair it is too underrated and certainly deserves more credit than it gets.It's a simple and predictable movie, yet so comical and full of slapstick humor. It isn't without a reason that it is considered, by many people, to have natural and obvious similarities with Dennis the Menace (the 1993 live-action movie) and the Home Alone movies.This is also an extremely surreal and completely impossible story, but then again, it isn't meant to be taken too seriously. Even if it's very strange than almost nobody notices the baby except his kidnappers.The story is all about Bink (a smaller name for Bennington or something like this), a baby with 9 months old who is kidnapped by a trio of bandits who pretend to be photographers. Little do they know what's waiting for them...The story becomes sort of an epic battle of completely hilarious proportions. Once the baby runaways from his kidnappers's place, he makes their lives miserable. They follow the baby all over the city, but always without success and they always suffer a lot one way or the other. They suffer so much that we even feel sorry for them, although all the movie's comical effect is here.The kidnappers are Veeko, Norby and Eddie, all of them greatly played by the respective actors. Eddie is the leader and the smartest of all. Veeko is the most stupid of the three. Norby is somewhere between Eddie and Veeko. Eddie is like Harry from the first two Home Alone movies the leader and the most serious and grumpy of them. Veeko, on the other hand, is like Marv from the same first two Home Alone movies very stupid, so much that you have to sympathize with him.The baby is naturally cute and adorable. He's got an irresistible cheerful personality and a lovely smile. By the way, I honestly think that the clothes which Norby dresses the baby are much better-looking than those which the baby's mother and nanny dressed him. The kidnappers had much better taste in this case.There are many funny moments in this movie, but the funniest of all is (without a doubt) when Eddie's pants are on fire. That is hysterical! Ouch! His faces on that scene and his affliction because the two police men won't go are hilarious. But the most bombastic part is when Veeko kicks him brutally until putting an end to the fire, being his final kick the strongest of all. My goodness, that scene is so infinitely hilarious that I could laugh without stopping.Overall, a movie which is fun, entertaining and unusual despite being so simple and predictable at the same time.

There is a lot wrong with Baby's Day Out. First off, let me start off by saying that this movie is about a character, the title character, who is a baby, named Baby Bink. The little toddler is then kidnapped by three kidnappers. then, the little rascal escaped and starts off his day. That's not all. While this baby is crawling all around the city being chased by the three burglars, he sort of get into these very almost dangerous hazards of injuring himself. For example, in one scene, he cross into oncoming traffic while cars are driving really fast on the road. That is something I really wanted to see in a movie like this one. Second of all, the three criminals look like they were rip right off of Home Alone. Even the slapstick humor is the same. Inanimate objects are flying all over the place, whacking the bad guys in the faces and everywhere else in their body. That is something you have to see to be believe.

Three men on a mission to kidnap the baby for money goes haywire when they let their guard down for a single moment.The rest of the movie actually does play out a bit like Home Alone with the slapstick moments of the bad guys falling into pits, making a gorilla angry, falling into a barrel of cement and plenty of head whacks.On the home front, Baby Bink's mother, (Laura Flynn Boyle) is devastated and nearly drained of the events of loosing her baby.Great comedy for someone who really needs a laugh and would be more than a pleaser to the kids.Watch for cameos from Alfred Molina, Eddie Bracken and janitor Scrubs star, Neil Flynn.

Yes, there are a considerable amount of crotch-shots, of references to diapers and to what lies within, and oh, the slapstick. Now, let me rebut myself.Where all the other 'babies versus adults' movies fall short, Baby's Day Out succeeds. Perhaps it's the little things that make this film work the minute shots in the scenes used to portray the individual characters' reactions to things that keep them individualized, the equality of slapstick that is issued to each of the antagonists, and the indecisiveness that both of the underling antagonists display with each progressive move they make. Or perhaps it's that damned catchy music playing the entire time. Or maybe it's the ending, hinting Well, we could really ruin this movie by making a sequel, but we won't stoop that low. Whatever it is about this movie, I love it. I grew up watching this on occasion, and I guess that brings me to develop a nostalgia for seeing that baby with perhaps the stupidest nickname I've ever heard for anything narrowly avoid the humorous attempts at his recapture and then giggle about it.Maybe there are a few crotchshot jokes, but the ways in which the slapstick is delivered fits well with the tone of the story. You should totally check this movie out, you guys.

I had a chance to watch it again nearly after 15-years on telly last Sunday and I made it a point to make my little one watch it as well. And boy even today - it still has its moments as I could see my little one was literally hooked on to it.To be fair this movie is Home Alone pushed to its limits and the pity factor raised to an exponential level. Definitely there are too many cinematic liberties but the way the story navigates makes you push them all under the carpet.The entire team deserves a special mention when it comes to capturing the right emotions of the Baby (I know how daunting it can get!). And I never knew that Baby Bink was enacted by twins - golly! Adequate support is lent by the other actors and special mention to Joe Mantegna & Joe Pantoliano (Memento).Back then, it did have enough potential to spin out a few sequels and churn money from the franchise - I wonder why didn't that happen.Verdict A few decades later Baby's Day Out will still retain its charm as it is today!

We don't like the Farrelly brothers or Woody Allen in his intellectual mode,but the late John Hughes has nailed it for us time and again since he (Boo,that is) was a puppy. Basically a trio of hapless crooks kidnap a baby for ransom - then live to rue the day.No prizes for originality then,but it's seamlessly played, particularly by Mantegna and his cohorts who display all the skills of practiced farceurs.Good physical comedy combined with a smart script adds up to a very funny and worthwhile piece of entertainment that Boo and I can recommend to anyone who doesn't think family comedy is not sophisticated enough for them. "},{"Title":"Three Stooges... and a baby.","Date":"27 August 2008","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Crime","Review":" My Take The HOME ALONE formula is too tired for it to still be funny.It seemed to hard for John Hughes to let his baby go, I mean his HOME ALONE formula. When will he ever just let the premise, about a little kid (this in case a tot) outsmart a couple of adult criminals, is something that doesn't last a mere two or three films or so. In this case, HOME ALONE 2 LOST IN NEW YORK is enough, very enough. While I liked HOME ALONE, and I enjoy sitting through it every Christmas season (or not), seeing a couple more times as different films is more than too much to ask for.BABY'S DAY OUT is producer Hughes' next film with HOME ALONE as its blood-donor, and while it has its share of Hughes-esquire comedy, it never rises as anything new or absolutely entertaining. There are a few pleasures to be had, but I didn't really quite had a nice time viewing it, and watching it at the small screen doesn't help much. For me, seeing a film which I already saw and better the last time, isn't really worth seeing a second (Third? Fourth? Whatever!), this time trying to be something else, isn't really twice the pleasure. It's like candy trying to be a main course.Instead of home-stuck 8-year old, Hughes turns him much younger... as a little infant. As a son of a wealthy couple (Lara Flynn Boyle and Matthew Glave), little Baby Bink (Adam Robert Worton and Jacob Joseph Worton) gets a real taste of the sweet life. A large mansion and full attention. In fact, too much attention, when his parents want him at the front page of the newspaper, three kidnappers dressed as photographers kidnap the little tyke in an effort to ransom the kid's parents for a large bag of cash. Easily looking at these three thugs (played by Joe Mantegna, Joe Pantoliano and Brian Haley, respectively), it's easy to scrutinize their inspirations The Three Stooges.But other than seeing these three go head-to-head (metaphorically speaking) with a baby, resulting in a series of wacky accidents meant for slapstick comedy, BABY'S DAY OUT isn't really quite as fun, or funny, as it should have been. The premise has little, if nothing at all, new to offer to the audience. Other than the three bumbling thugs, here's a piece best left as a kid's film.Rating **1/2 out of 5.

There are children's movies and then there are family movies, and the good family movies are the ones that can really be enjoyed by people of all ages. This movie does not at all strike me as a movie that could be enjoyed by people of all ages, mostly because of that picture on the movie box. Ever since King Kong Lives I have developed an almost frightening aversion to any movie that features grinning gorillas. Nevertheless I gave this one a chance and I'm glad I did.Amazingly enough, almost immediately I discovered that this movie is funnier than most adult comedies that I've seen lately, even the good ones. There are so many laugh-out- loud moments just in the first 30 minutes that I didn't know how they could keep that up. Sadly, they don't, but even the less impressive second half is a fun romp through the city at the expense of some witless crooks. The kids are gonna love this. The similarities to Home Alone are obvious and expected, being written by John Hughes, who has an astonishing list of writing, producing and directing credits stretching over the last 35 years, including genuine classics like Ferris Bueller's Day Off, The Breakfast Club, The Great Outdoors and Home Alone. And yes, Home Alone is a classic, I don't care what anyone says!There is one scene of ridiculous bad taste, when Eddie (Joe Mantegna) is hiding the baby under his coat so the police don't find it, only to suddenly discover that he has to maintain his cool before the men in blue as the baby lights a Zippo lighter and lights his crotch on fire. For a movie that is so obviously meant for a very young audience, this one has a surprising amount of sex jokes. That is, however, the only major problem with the movie (except at the end when they discover that Baby is only acting out his favorite storybook. RIGHT). Yes, the baby manages to walk around crowded city streets without anyone ever noticing except the bad guys, but he also manages to climb onto a steel beam being lifted hundreds of feet off of the ground AND cuddle with a monstrous gorilla, both without showing the least bit of fear. Man, that gorilla was scary, too. Obviously not real, but my question is how they got that kid to sit next to that thing without screaming and crying in fear. Nevertheless, there are so many funny moments and so many truly hilarious jokes (I seen him. He's in the big broad's purse&#133;.) that it's easy to overlook these things. Like so many other movies, if you apply real world logic to it, of course it falls apart immediately, but for an evening of good clean fun you could certainly do a lot worse!

These films with their varied and different plots were original. In 1990, when Hughes went out of his element with Home Alone, he scored his biggest box office success ever. The same fate went for that film's 1992 sequel. For some unknown reason, everything that Hughes has done since then has tried to repeat the success of Home Alone and Baby's Day Out is no exception. For this film, think what if Kevin McAlister (Macaulay Culkin's character in the first two Home Alone films) fought burglars and criminals as a baby. The similarities never stop coming. There are some minor laughs here but they could've most likely come out of the Home Alone series script wastebasket. Rent the first two Home Alone films for originality reasons and rent this one only if you feel like making comparisons.

Violence is a big part of this movie and a lot of it takes place below the belt. The baby not only burns the bad guy's groin, but the baby also put his hands on the bad guy's crotch and twists it... yikes! In another scene the baby kicks one of the bad guys in the groin... What's up with that?! No baby should ever have this much contact with a man's groin in a movie, much less in real life. How many would find any of this funny if the bad guy was a woman and a baby inflicted this much pain on the female genitals or breast?? Sorry to say, but pedophiles are everywhere, even in movie-making, and their main objective is to gradually introduce your children to acts of perversion.

The plot is simple - a variant on the two McCauley Culkin HOME ALONE films or O'Henry's THE RANSOM OF RED CHIEF, except the protagonist is an adorable baby. Three criminals led by Joe Mantegna have been committing fairly successful robberies at convenience stores and even banks. They find that a wealthy family's baby is going to be photographed on a particular day for a magazine, and they arrive at the mansion as the photographers and kidnap the baby. They intend to collect a large ransom. What they don't count on is that the baby, by instinct and sheer chance, is smarter than all three men together. The baby's favorite book has a kind of daily itinerary, and the baby (after accidentally escaping the three idiots) follows it. He is usually only one step ahead of the idiots, so they constantly find him - only to fall on their faces (or worse) while he continues with hardly a scratch. All ends well for the baby at the end.The supporting cast is quite good, in particular Fred Dalton Thomas as the FBI man, John Neville as the household's major domo, Lara Flynn Boyle as the heart-sick mother (the only really unfunny, realistic aspect to the film), and Cynthia Nixon as the nanny. But the chief kudos go to Adam and Jacob Worton as Baby Bink, and Mantegna and his two cohorts Brian Haley and Joe Pantoliano. Of the three men Mantegna is clearly the sharpest, but that does not say much.The clearest comparison of this film is with the Road Runner cartoons of Chuck Jones, with Mantegna, Haley, and Pantoliano trying to use their superior grown-up cleverness to simply recapture Baby Bink. The problem is that their methods are so complicated for themselves that they cannot but fail. They follow the baby into the zoo, and rather than simply scooping the kid up by racing to him, they let him head into the monkey house, and are soon being thrown around by a wise and protective gorilla. The chase the baby into the park, and (incredibly) they do get their hands on him, but two policemen come to them with some questions and Mantegna has to hide the baby under his coat. The baby uses his lighter to set fire to his testicles (and Mantegna has to restrain screaming until the police leave the scene, which is a priceless moment). The script manages to top it - to put out the fire Mantegna's two assistant crooks put it out the way you put out a campfire (they stamp it out!).To me the highpoint is when Baby Bink goes into a construction site. None of the construction workers notice the baby at all, but our three anti-heroes do. They proceed to keep missing the baby and end up falling into cement troughs or into refuse dumps. Mantegna adds the one truest moment out of Wile E. Coyote's fights with Roadrunner. He jumps onto a huge crane's arm, holding onto a battering ball. His intention (as the crane was headed downward) is to have an elevator descent by the crane to the ground. Just as he lands on the ball, the face on all the clocks in the construction site hit five o'clock, a whistle blows, and the machines (including the crane) are all turned off at once, and the crews all leave the site. The sequence ends with the sun setting in back of the clinging Mantegna waiting to figure out how to get down.For pure malicious, destructive delight, BABY'S DAY OUT can barely be touched.
