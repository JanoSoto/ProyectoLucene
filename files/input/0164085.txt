[{"Title":"Challenging, absorbing&#133;another John Sayles gem cut distinctly different - more than meets the eye","Date":"6 January 2000","Score":"31 out of 32 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  Once again, as do all John Sayles films, this is no Hollywood fare. There are no easy answers or solutions to the questions raised or problems illustrated. John Sayles gives his insightful subtle approaches to another aspect of life and living, of ordinary people tackling everyday encounters and challenges. Nothing spectacular (yet it is quietly spectacular). It's another multi-character study, and Sayles is very good at telling the story and providing the different premises and details in a seemingly casual manner. Sayles fans know it will not be a boring journey - life lessons will be assimilated. In LIMBO, photography is skillfully delivered by veteran cinematographer Haskell Wexler (the unforgettable Medium Cool 1969, which he also wrote and directed; The Thomas Crown Affair 1968 with director Norman Jewison; two with Sayles Matewan 1987, The Secret of Roan Inish 1994). Here, graphic detail shots are included on fishing, informing us of the intricacies involved - it's Sayles ingredients to the core.Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, as always, a tour de force. She gets to demonstrate what a wonderful singer she can be. She did a terrific job - she sings so well that it sounds like Judy Collins at times! David Strathairn, for once, is not in a supporting role. He is in the male lead role and as expected, a quiet sensitive delivery of his character as a fisherman incognito. There is mother and daughter tension at play here. Vanessa Martinez played the teenage daughter and what a superb performance - hers is no easy role. The segment by the campfire where she reads from a diary book, her subtle expressions and poignant portrayal complete this triangle of complex emotional cauldron a-brewing&#133;yet she held her own in capturing our attention on her touching delivery.This is not an easy film to consume - it provides mind probing and requires reflective thinking. A John Sayles fan MUST-SEE, or anyone who's ready for a different movie and a change of pace. Music is by Mason Daring. As usual, the film is written, directed, and edited by John Sayles himself.

This film really impressed me.What I look for is a few things, that if done well will really satisfy. Among them are--daring use of the cinematic medium--transporting me to a conceptual space that I otherwise wouldn't have experienced--self referenceCINEMATIC Sayles is a storyteller, who thoroughly understands what it means to build a narrative scaffold using film. This is theater completely recast for the unique strengths of film, and only possible when the same person writes, directs and edits. This camera is literally introduced as a character when noelle offers it an `hoordoov.' The camera participates, the lights participate. We have overlapping dialog, overlapping cuts, multiple views of the same scene. We have long panning multithreaded scenes. We have a dramatic pacing which starts slow, sets a lot of potential threads and convincingly fools you into relying on certain expectations.Then narrative commitments are made before you are ready, and then come faster and more unexpectedly until the very gutsy end. Sayles knows in real storytelling, there's a game between teller and listener, each trying to outwit the other. A masterful storyteller teases but plays by the rules, allowing the reader to take risks. It takes craft to do this in the written word, and is extremely rare using the more intimate but external and slippery experience of cinema.TRANSPORTING Alaskan wilderness as theme park where stories are safely refined for casual visitors. That would be enough given this level of craft. But Sayles takes us into Noelle's diary world. That's the center of this film's world, the world of the mystical Shefox. Deep imagery here -- superficially referenced in the `real' action. I do not expect to ever forget that visit. The self-reference is in both.Much has been made of the actors, and I think that a mistake since the creative force here is clearly Sayles. But this girl Martinez has some magic. Who will write parts for her?

This is a terrible shame, as John Sayles is at the top of his game.  Set in Alaska, Limbo comments incisively on a variety of complex issues concerning the vast state -- the relentless tourism, the scarcity of meaningful employment for the working class, and the careless abuses of irreplaceable natural resources by the wealthy, to name a few.  All of these interesting themes, however, are discarded half-way through in favor of a thought-provoking story of human survival that will undoubtedly light a fire for some while irritating and alienating others.  Sayles has not always connected with me, but I was deeply moved by Limbo (especially the rich characterizations provided by Martinez, Mastrantonio, and Sayles regular Strathairn) -- and I absolutely loved the gutsy ending, which continues to occupy my thoughts.

The acting was excellent, particularly, Vanessa Martinez as a very believable teenager. David Strathairn was both restrained and passionate. I just wasn't completely convinced that Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's character had gone through changes to be at peace with herself.

A lot of insights provided there, including a lot of little details which give you insight into movie-making--the reason for multiple takes, visual effects, the importance of 'continuity', and even a lot about sound, which was a big issue in the making of this film.I was amazed to learn that Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is such a terrific singer--she sang all the songs and, in fact, her voice was recorded live while shooting the scenes, not dubbed in later in post-production. Sayles describes this in his narrative.Sayles had less to say in the narrative about the ending, but based on the comments he DID make it was all quite intentional--not the result of studio politics or a screenwriter (Sayles himself) who couldn't decide on a final ending. In fact, I would suggest that it is Sayles' standing in the business that permitted this film to be produced & released without answering the question of what becomes of those characters, though it also occurs to me that it could be the reason why this film didn't get much of a marketing push. Clearly the audience is left hanging in--dare I say it--a state of limbo. Sayles has no intention, based on his comments, of a sequel, though he invites anyone else to dream one up if they wish.But aside from all this, it was a terrific film, with interesting characters, shot in unusual and often stunning locations (Insomnia comes to mind when thinking of recent films shot in Alaska with its scenic backdrops).The cast was generally quite good--Mastrantonio and Strathairn were terrific, and Kris Kristofferson was a great choice as the likable but edgy local, Smilin' Jack Johannson. Vanessa Martinez was, for me, less convincing as the daughter until the boat trip and beyond, but that is when her character becomes truly important to the story and her work was quite good when it mattered most; up to then it was all teenage angst.Overall, I enjoyed 'Limbo' a great deal, and the limbo in which the audience is left with such abruptness was, for me, almost a slap in the face--a welcome one--in striking contrast to the 'Star Wars' series in which George Lucas took 6 movies and nearly 30 years to tell us how Darth Vader came to be.Note I am NOT slamming Lucas or 'Star Wars' by that comment, only making a point.

Strathairn brings an everyman quality to every role he's in. The film is also not unlike Strathairn's own The River Wild. At least, without the contrivances. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is also good as a bar singer (she sings pretty well too) hauling her teenage daughter (Vanessa Martinez, very good in her debut) through gig after gig. The film also has some thriller elements; but, this of course, is Sayles, who wisely pushes for character development and dialogue ladened with truth.As he proved with EIGHT MEN OUT, MATEWAN, CITY OF HOPE, and PASSION FISH, Sayles is a truly gifted writer/director.

Another flick which, forgive me, can't seem to decide what it wants to be.

The self-absorption and the amazingly flamboyant failed attempts at good parenting are all part of the title Limbo. Mastroantonio's character is in perpetual limbo, and as a result, so is her daughter. Straithairn is simply trying to live, in limbo due to an accident for which he feels responsible (but isn't). The community is in limbo, as well, as industries close and local officials try to find a way to keep the economy afloat (and their own pockets full). Although one could argue that the crisis - Straithairn's brother's 'situation' - is a little manipulative, I didn't mind it, and I loved the fact that the crisis led the trio to a 'time-out' - limbo within a limbo. It was filmed so beautifully, acted so amazingly well and was so nice and slow that I almost felt envious of the characters for their situation - who, in real life, gets to put their life into a perspective while bonding with other truly caring souls? Of course, being hunted by killers, starving to death and worrying about dying in the Alaskan winter are no picnic...but, there was a strong sense of togetherness and of honesty, even painful and inappropriate honesty. As for the ending --- well, I, too, shouted 'NO!' at the screen, but only because I ended up loving these characters so much I wanted to see them do well - to get out of limbo, as they all so ardently wish for (the final scene itself was so expressive, both in the staging and the acting, that it tore me up). Of course, I didn't want them to die, either! A perfectly formed movie. I will watch it again, for sure.

Then the next thing you know you're stuck on some wet, dank, isolated-on-the-buttwipe-end Alaskan island with this gal you were just getting to know real well, not to mention her teenage daughter who's into self-mutilation and strange stories, and to top it all off some drug running nimrods who just got burned are looking for all your butts with their superduper peekaboo scoped rifle.I'm talking about Limbo, made by the one of best directors who doesn't give a damn about Hollywood and does it his way all the time-John Sayles, and has one of my favorite babe actress-Mary Elizabeth Maistrantonio.  It all takes place somewhere way up in Alaska where men are fisherman, women are fish cleaners, and the tourists are stupid fat Midwesterners.  My babe Mary is this singer who just left her 51st, or 63rd, or 102nd guy and goes right after her 52nd or 64th or whatever, who is this guy who used to be a fisherman but due to 'unforeseen circumstances' isn't one now.  But since way up there in fish country winters are long and women are scarce and fish just don't last all winter he decides she is all right, and besides she is Mary Elizabeth Maistrantonio.    Anyway, he and she and the teenage daughter decide to go for a boat ride, so off they go along with his long-lost half-brother who decides to pull a con on his half-bro and use him as a bodyguard for some stupid pigheaded easy money drug deal.  But of course it ain't easy money, and so it's a man overboard and everyone swim for their life scene.We got fish being cleaned, fish being shot, fish being canned, fish being fish, we got pretty postcard pictures of somewheres up in Alaska which looks like they got enough trees to build all of us a 5000 square foot house, we got losers in a bar with their own barstool, we got Robinson Crusoe only Friday is a babe and her daughter, and finally we got an ending that just goes to show that we don't really know what's going to happen in our lives.Three and a half bright north stars.

All of this could be forgiven, if once the story kicks into gear, with the mother, daughter, and David Strathairn stranded on a remote island, something happened. Unfortunately the second half in the wild, is tedious and boring. I recommend fast forwarding every time the daughter picks up the diary.

The latter is perpetually upset by the former's continuous succession of boy friends, forcing the daughter to move each year and feel a loneliness that is eating her up. The plot, in short, resembles that of Neal Simon's The Goodbye Girl.Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is superb as the singer, and David Strathairn is a fine lead male character. More than halfway through the film, the plot takes a strong turn, and the lives of the three major characters are placed in jeopardy. Incredibly, the film ends without resolving the issue. We do not know if these interesting people we've learned to know for the past couple of hours are murdered or rescued. In a theater, I would have booed and thrown things at the screen. (Well, at least when I was younger and dumber.) Along the way, we receive some liberal propaganda about the commercial uses of Alaska. And there are some fine shots of the landscape and seascape. But don't expect to learn much about the state, for this is a fascinating melodrama that could have been filmed anywhere. What a shame that John Sayles copped out at the end, leaving many viewers frustrated and angry.

After being attacked on a sailing trip, they are marooned on a small deserted island and must fend for themselves.A typically observant, well-written, intriguing and thoughtful drama from editor-writer-director Sayles, where even the minor characters are witty and interesting. As with all of Sayles' work, his smooth, relaxed style seems to bring out the very best in his actors and make the story all the more poignant and touching - his technique is almost invisible. The cast are great, with Strathairn giving another of his intense, quiet character studies in his seventh film for Sayles, but the real find is Martinez, who is terrific as the sweet-natured girl Noelle, tired of her mother's vagrancy and succession of boyfriends. Sayles also picks wonderful locations for his stories, and the Alaskan backdrops and fishing communities here are beautiful and evocative (although since I spent my honeymoon in the winter in British Columbia, I'm kinda biased in that regard).

It feels like an upmarket TV movie at first but the acting and camera-work are superior to that aforementioned fare. There is a sense of a community evoked by Sayles's direction as he follows a diverse array of characters and overlaps their problems with the actions of others, while, at the same time, providing enough social commentary on the evils of capitalism that threaten the natural beauty of Alaska. This socio-political commentary is subtle enough because Sayles avoids stereotypes in his portrayal of the inhabitants. The first half feels fragmented at times but the presentation of the blossoming romance between the two main characters provides a seemingly stable counterpoint to the Altmanesque rendering of the tale.However, the film is really a tease. It abandons the first half in favor of the unexpected Lord of the Flies scenario involving the three main characters for the second half. Moreover, it changes mood full circle, using fear and anxiety as the main concerns of the three stranded characters, whose lives hang in the balance, in a state of limbo as it were. I wasn't sure how the first half related to the second, and I still feel uneasy about the total break Sayles employed between both parts. As a result, it feels like two films joined together. I also feel Sayles abandoned any sense of a multi-threaded narrative drive he successfully built into the first part in favor of the unexpected second part. The second part may symbolically allude to the film's title but it's also an abrupt digression of the preceding genre. Why bother with showing the first hour if it wasn't followed up? Why bother showing many characters in the first half, then abandoning their concerns in the later, as if it didn't matter? This is essentially a TV movie for the art-house crowd but one that challenges and frustrates in equal measure.

The result is a mishmash of scenes which jump from plot to plot never managing to resolve anything. Even in the final 45 minutes were events allow the movie to focus tightly on the three key characters the storyline shambles along without ever giving us any idea of what the characters are really feeling.Worst of all the Noelle character seems to be nothing but a mannequin on which the screenwriter and director hang an obvious clutch of jerry springer style teenage angst issues.  No wonder then that she shows almost no emotion during the beach scene were her mother imparts the incredibly obvious secret she's been keeping about her father.Overall a movie which fails to live up to its potential.

This is New York after all.)My point is, all the likeable parts are completely negated by the absolutely a-w-f-u-l ending. You may have read other reviews where the author hints at the ending as if it were some kind of Crying-Game-type secret; this isn't true at all. There's nothing highbrow about it.Goodbye, my $9.50.

The family has to flee the murderers, they live in a sort of a manger (the old fur farm), and read the lost diary of those who went before (the Old Testament). At the end, they are faced with the Slaughter of the Innocents. You don't have to be a believer to be fascinated by the beauty of the landscape and mysterious serenity of Noelle; Sayles draws the viewer into his world and meets the challenging of retelling this story in a new way.

The writer/director John Sayles wanted to make an unconventional movie that plays with audience expectations . When there is a shotgun hanging on the wall the audience should expect that it will be used in the movie &#x96; that's how most movies work. The writers write movies as a mathematical calculation where 2 plus 2 gives 4 . They want to capture life in their movies , but often the shape their own reality based on logic with moral in the end. After watching many movies audience can have certain expectations about where the story is going, what will happen , what could happen and what will be the message.Styles here tries to imitate life as much as it's possible. In the first half of movie we are introduced to characters that don't really play any important part in the second half &#x96; the lesbian couple , frustrated fisherman , jolly bartender. In fact Limbo is basically two movies in one , similar to Full metal jacket. The first hour is a movie about people of small town , while the second hour pretends to be a thriller about three people. Calling this movie a thriller is a bit misleading , it's certainly no Deliverance. The acting is fine . Vanessa Martinez is believable as angry teenager , David Strathairn is effectively playing troubled, but good hearted handy-man . Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is lovely as singer who can't settle with her life. There is some nice fun dialogue here and the movie is quite beautifully photographed.Limbo doesn't work either as thriller or drama . The thriller elements are few and badly done . There is a lot of potential drama here  troubled past of Joe , the love triangle , the mother-daughter relationship. The problem is that everything is done with sensibility of soap opera . I'm sorry , but I wasn't move by anything here. The movie is too slow in some places. There is also an irritating amount of small talk that leads nowhere. And why waste your time of showing characters in the first half of the movie when they don't play any part in the second half . Kris Kristofferson is supposed to be an important character , yet his completely bland.The biggest problem however is the ending . I don't mind open endings that allow the audience to use imagination and decide what happened in the end &#x96; Mechanic , Inception, The Killing of Chinese bookie and few others. The fans of Sayles say that it was the only way to end the movie and there is some merit in their arguments . However , Sayles himself admitted that he didn't knew how to end the movie and the ending is the result of that . It feels like the movie misses a reel. In my opinion it's awful ending.Limbo is kinda interesting experiment , but after two viewings I still think it's an ambitious failure. I give it 3/10.

He has found his niche in writing for the screen and directing, yet he receives mediocre attention to what density his films carry. My all-time favorite film, Matewan (1987), is also by Sayles, and in Limbo, he has done something incredible bringing us a true-to-heart narrative in a small Alaskan town. From the first moments of picture; of salmon restlessly waiting to find a place to go, until the heart-throbbing and hard-hitting ending we examine sub texts between the characters and their past. While the beginning may take a bit to set up shop on where Sayles exactly plans to take us, he does it methodically weaving dialog in and out of shots; interlocking sentence after sentence between different characters while at the same time making a point. The Alaskan wilderness is a perfect setting because nature is unpredictable and Juneau (among other places) is one of the few areas in which all roads lead to virtually nowhere. Meanwhile, Sayles is just prepping us to realize we too as viewers of this narrative, are in Limbo. David Strathairn, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, and Vanessa Martinez deliver wonderful performances that from the beginning reveal their character's interesting pasts. Strathairn seems lost ever since a boating accident that took two friends, and has never gone fishing since while Mastrantonio is a club singer constantly on the move to find a living and a place to keep her and her daughter happy. And finally Martinez is the confused teenager also lost for who she may be and where she belongs. She has a drifting relationship with her mother (Mastrantonio) and finds comfort when talking to Strathairn's character at work. When the three are kept on an Alaskan island with nothing but the clothes on their back, a new element is subtly brought in when Martinez finds a long lost diary of a stranger. She begins reading passages by night as we delve into another world; a lost perspective that is incredibly poetic and raw with emotion.As the backdrop strengthens we are soon deep into Sayles' fantastically created narrative. We think we know where the story is going, but right when you think you know the answer Sayles takes us in the complete opposite direction. It is unconventional storytelling and a film that brings us one of the greatest endings in cinema history. "},{"Title":"Brilliant multifaceted commentary on the power of Story","Date":"25 July 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Thriller","Review":" This film is going to upset many of its viewers. Most people go into a movie with some expectation that it's going to get set up in the first few minutes to tell a certain kind of story, and stick with it. Exceptions might occur in some art movies - but this doesn't seem very artsy - or a thriller; there's nothing thriller-like here at all in fact - until halfway through, when it all changes 180 degrees.Donna (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) is a 40is struggling singer playing a small coastal city in Alaska. At the beginning of the film she's at an outdoor wedding and she happens to break up with her boyfriend, a member of the band she's singing with, and needs a ride home which she gets from Joe Gastineau (David Strathairn) a somewhat older man who works for the lesbian couple that own the house where the wedding takes place. The low-key Joe and the more aggressive Donna form an uneasy friendship, that uneasily leads to a romance complicated by the fact that Donna's introverted teen-aged daughter Noelle (Vanessa Martinez) also has a crush on Joe, who she sometimes works with.So this is a low-key drama about working-class people struggling and finding love in a remote town, right? There are several scenes set in a bar where Donna finds work after leaving her band, lots of dialogue about how tough the fishing is, how rough things are now that a canning plant has closed down - there are a couple of brief shots of the factory, cleaning up for a last time. We have Kris Kristofferson playing his typical menacing but charming adversary in the background, involved some way in Joe's questionable past; a sort of love-triangle, a difficult mother-daughter relationship, and the uneasy situation he finds himself in when his much-younger half-brother Bobby (Casey Siemaszko) shows up needing help with a little job...At this point, as Joe and Donna and Noelle accompany Bobby on a boat trip to a remote island, the uneasiness starts to build - what exactly is Bobby up to? Why is he upset that Joe is bringing the two women along - but unwilling to tell him not to? On their first night, anchored in a small bay, we find the answer to these questions but they bring on more problems that carry through to the end of the film. Soon Joe, Donna and Noelle are stranded on the island, fending off starvation, cold -- and the possibility of murder. The low-key family/romantic drama has become a frightening survival-thriller with no easy or positive outcome in sight.So we have one kind of film that quickly and surprisingly changes into another kind, but what is really remarkable about Limbo is that there's a third film lurking beneath the surface from the first moments to the last, that really makes itself known only near the very end - unless you're sharper at noticing what's going on beneath the pretty blunt and sometimes stereotypical dialogue and characters than I was on a first go-round. Limbo is about the very nature of storytelling, in all its forms - lying, exaggeration, the tricks that memories play, the stories we're told that end up being lies, and the lies we tell ourselves. In an old abandoned shack on the island, Noelle finds a hundred-year old diary, and reads from it every night for the couple of weeks the trio are stranded. The diary recounts hardships and privations, and joys at the wonder of nature; it also carries sometimes-subtle reflections of Noelle's feelings about her mother, reflected back when Noelle is informed that the stories she was told about her biological father have all been false. The revelations in the last few minutes, when we think about what they have to say about the characters we are watching now, on this little island, say just as much to us about the conversations and flashes of earlier histories that we've heard throughout the film, and we begin to question where and with whom real truth ever lies - and whether it matters as much as the stories we choose to tell, and the ways in which we embellish those truths, for good or ill.I have some problems with Limbo that I tend to have with a lot of Sayles' films - many of the characters seem to be...characters; much of the dialogue is wooden and sounds written; many of the little touches he throws in (Noelle being vegan and her penchant for self-mutilation) seem obvious and generic. But the central performances are all so excellent (particularly Martinez, whose career seems to have alas gone nowhere), and the ending so elegant and so miraculous in its achievement of wrapping everything into a grand and beautiful inquiry into the power of myth-making and storytelling, that I can largely forgive the faults. Overall, a brilliant film with one of the very best endings I've ever seen.

Ambrose Bierce's short story An Incident at Owl Creek Bridge is often cited as representative of naturalism--in the end, whether the character lives or dies can depend on something as trivial as whether a rope breaks. This theme appears at several junctures in Limbo, including a tragedy in the past of Joe Gastineau, the main character. Indeed, Alaska is an excellent choice for such a story about how man's power over nature and other forces is often illusory. (The potentially deadly nature of the environment contrasts sharply with the developer's notion of Alaska as one huge theme park. Echoes of Jurassic Park here....)*********** SPOILERS ************This needs to be kept in mind when considering the ending. People have expressed frustration at Sayles' refusal to tell us what happens to the three characters at the end. But the whole point is that it could go either way--they could meet a quick end, or be rescued. Sayles has told the important story, and has left out exactly what should have been left out--to make exactly the same point he has been making all along.It's also interesting to reflect that the (non-)ending of the movie parallels the ending the daughter Noelle gives to the diary. There's a last entry, which tells us not much, and that's it. (There's a parallel on the meta-level, too  in both cases the author *chooses* not to give us a definite ending....)Like everything else Sayles has done, this movie is a pleasure to watch, and a pleasure to reflect on afterward.

It is about people in Alaska struggling to get through their day-to-day lives, some with dignity, some not so much.  They are all interesting and they all have their secrets and their stories.  Like any small town, everyone knows everyone else's problems.   The second half of the movie is about circumstances that leave Joe Gastineau, his new girlfriend, and her daughter stranded on a remote island and their struggle to survive.  I had trouble believing any of the action in the second half.  It starts going wrong when Joe brings the girls on his brother's boat without asking his brother if that was OK.  Then his brother does not object even though he knows it is going to be dangerous.   Later, the bad guys track down the boat, even though the boat is not where it is supposed to be due to a storm.  The bad guys are able to silently sneak up on and board the boat.  Joe and friends are able to swim away from and escape from the bad guys even though the bad guys have a motor boat and guns.  They struggle to survive on the remote island, but they always seem too clean, dry, shaved, and well fed.   The movie then has a cop-out ending, although I could not think of a better ending, given the incredible action that preceded it.The second half of the movie did not feel like a John Sayles movie.  It was like someone else wrote it.This movie has some great performances.  David Strathairn is a troubled, but good hearted handy-man.   Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is wonderful as a singer who is just barely keeping her life in order and raising a daughter.

The life is very hard here but the fishermen, the factory workers fight for the survive. At first sight they seem to be losers and at second sight, too.

He meets the singer Donna De Angelo (Mary Elisabeth Mastrantonio - never been better) and her daughter, Noelle (the new talent Vanessa Martinez). They fall in love and these three people find their destiny at the end of the world. Deep feelings set in hard, unbearable locations. John Sayles is a real talent. His film is a very good drama and a very good thriller, one of the best film of 1999. You want to refuse this film because it's very hard to watch, but if you start to watch it you can't turn it off until the very end of the film. I say 'the very end' because you can hear Bruce Springsteen's Lift Me Up during the end titles. Listen it, because it's a very good song.

There's Donna, the lounge singer, a darkly attractive woman in her 40's, been on the road a long time, a little crass, needs men to feel rooted, restlessly dragging her teen daughter around the country. Noelle, the girl, suffers from bouts of self-mutilation and lives a fantasy that the  father who abandoned them upon her birth is being kept from her by her mother.  Then there's Joe Gastineau, an odd, internal fisherman who falls for Donna but is harbouring secrets about his past. As their lives beginning to intertwine, they all find themselves thrown together into a struggle for survival, both emotional and physical.At first, slow paced and seemingly fragmented, Sayles gets the momentum rolling quickly as the story begins to come together, much like he did in the movie Wild Thing (1987). The startling ending is unsatisfying in that it almost sticks out there too obviously as a plot device requiring the viewer to feel left hanging (like the title). However, perhaps it's simply Sayles technique at work, wanting to get a unsettled reaction, forcing the audience to empathise with the characters who know not what their fate will be.Whether one likes the ending or not, for those who appreciate unusual films which take chances and are filled with intriguingly not-so-simple folk, this is a movie to watch.

That is - the entire second half misfires. After promising to turn the heat up, it instead stalls. This is not because of the pace, slow as it is. It is simply that it builds so promisingly, until an inspired twist deflates things.Up to the turning point, a number of astute characters are drawn and the plot threatens to move in any number of directions. When it makes its 180-degree turn, it quite literally leaves the rest of the world behind. So we applaud the filmmakers nerve, but the outcome is more than a little disappointing.Any number of sub-plots are sacrificed. That is the point, I guess. That is the consequence of living in LIMBO, we can never accommodate for where life takes us. But little happens to stir the interests until the final scenes.When it does, you will react.

This story is about victims; the three main characters are victims even before the tragedy occurs.  Joe tragically lost his boat, the life of a friend, and much of his hope in life in an accident so long ago.  Donna seems to be victimized by men, even more than she lets on.  She seemed to be hurt by someone a long time ago, and keeps looking for men that will satisfy her in a way she's unsure will ever happen.  Noelle seems to be outcasted, and feels abandoned.  She has become somewhat of a narcissist, assuming the physical pain will relieve the pain she feels inside.  She seems to also have a poor self image and, like many teenage girls, forces herself to pay way too much attention to the commercial and material world.  All three characters were wrongly harmed, as they're all good people, yet they're lives have been stunted and destroyed.  There are many scenes in the movie that are so moving and so painful and so cathartic, they would make the movie great by themselves.  And we feel so bad that they are where they are in life.And we hope, we really do, that when Joe and Donna meet and speak to each other, that they will fall in love and cure what ails them.  This is what the story is about.  It is about how victims can come together and rid they're terrible losses.Yet Sayles might or might not have a different story to tell from this point on.  Without giving away too much, he seems to always be looking at everything from two opposite angles.  Look at, for instance, the completely pessimistic daughter and the overtly optimism her mother preaches. The daughter is always looking at everything in the past as being better than what could possibly happen in the future.  When the mother leaves the boyfriend, her daughter gets angry, saying the man wasn't that bad.  She doesn't really hate her mother; she just gets angry that the existance that she just was coming to terms with seems to keep being destroyed.  Perhaps she only came to terms with the life after she had to leave the situation, so perhaps she could never be happy.  The mother, though, always looks at the future as being someplace good, and that she isn't really a victim; she just hasn't figured out how not to be one yet.  Joe is sort of the middle ground.  He seems to be content wherever he goes; sometimes he hopes to the future, while other times he doesn't mind being just where he is.  Sometimes, being an optimist is good, as with the relationship with Donna.  Sometimes, his optimism creates a tragic happening; such as his hope of sailing and becoming a fisherman again.I do not think the strengths of this movie are that it keeps you guessing every turn of the way.  Instead, it answers the question Is the glass half empty or half full? in a new way.  The answer is every bit of cryptic as the question, and how the movie ends even depends on what type of person the viewer is.  Is he or she(the viewer) more like the daughter or the mother?  Or maybe the viewer will be more like Joe and try to make logical sense out of the mess.  If Joe were asked the glass question, he'd probably answer If the glass was empty and was only poured half full with water, then it's half full.  If, however, it was completely full and someone drank half, it's half empty.  He is more of the logical person, always seeing both sides, and wondering if it's in the best decision to be pessimistic or optimistic.  Each type of person(the pessimistic, the optimistic, and the logical) will end up watching a completely different movie, and also goes through life with a different point of view.  Sayles is trying to point this out.  One of my favorite lines in the movie, and one of the best lines that points this out, is said by Donna, who says If you think bad things are going to happen, they will.  The optimist will respond, Well, yeah.  The pessimist will say It will because it's going to happen anyway.  The logical will say What an absurd thing to say!  The movie somehow allowed me to think all three things at once right after she said this line.Perhaps Sayles isn't answering the half full half empty question, yet asking it, in a more subtle, artistic way.  The viewer will answer without even thinking about it.  My biggest compliment I could pay to this film is there is not one person that allows himself to watch the film that won't be affected by it, even if they think they hate it.  If there is one director whose goal in mind is more to affect the person watching it than he cares about how someone will review the movie, it's Sayles.  If Sayles wanted to end the movie in a more traditional and cinematic way, it would have been considered more of a Fargo type masterpiece.  Yet, he decided to sacrifice this in order to let the viewer think, which is what he feels is important.  Limbo is one of the most subtly thoughtful and moving movies I've ever seen, and what's spectacular about it is that Sayles doesn't even want the viewer to realize the movie was the reason he reaffirmed or changed himself and his views on the world.  I loved this movie, and there is so much more here than meets the eye, and much more than I caught after one viewing.  I think Limbo has to be the best movie I've seen from 1999.  My rating 10/10.

"}{"Title":"Unrealized potential","Date":"10 January 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  Limbo is a film that almost was.  John Sayles (writer/director) inadvertently creates a film that mimics its characters in its unrealized potential.This is an exquisitely crafted character study of three people, each with a gift that was never fully realized due to intervening circumstances.  Joe (David Straithairn) was an all state basketball player who blew out his knee and never got a chance to play professionally.  Donna (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) is a talented singer relegated to lounge acts because of her choice in men.  Noelle, Donna's daughter (Vanessa Martinez) is a talent writer and storyteller, who immerses herself in self abuse, self loathing and self pity.Sayles develops each character with great care and we are drawn into their less than perfect lives with a feeling of affection and sympathy.  It is easy for the viewer to find himself pulling hard for these characters.  As the story unfolds, as is almost their fate, they are thrown into another crisis by Joe's screw-up brother.  The characters are tested and show their tenacity to survive yet another of fate's blows.  Sayles draws us in, whets our appetite and then leaves us totally unsatisfied in the ending.The actors played their roles splendidly.  Both greatly underrated Mastantonio and Straithairn had great screen chemistry.  Mastrantonio played the self deluding, self doubting woman who's life revolves around finding a man and played it to perfection.  She also did all her own vocals and has such a beautiful singing voice that one is left wondering why she didn't pursue a second career as a recording artist.  Straithairn reminds me a little of Gary Cooper with his strong quiet type portrayals, except Cooper was always enigmatic and Straithairn plays his characters with more human vulnerability and approachability.  His portrayal of Joe's life of disappointment was exceptional.  Vanessa Martinez shines as the pouty, self hating Noelle.  Even Casey Siemaszko played his part well as Joe's self inflated loser of a brother.I was prepared to give this film a 9 or 10 rating until the ending.  I have seen thousands of films and the ending of this film is undoubtedly the worst I've ever seen.  If I were to tell you the ending, it wouldn't ruin it, that's how bad it was.  Sayles took so much pain to make us love these characters and want them to overcome this crisis and then gives us an ending with no closure.  It was cruel, disappointing and infuriating to the viewers who invested so much emotion in these characters to draw us in and leave us in the state we find ourselves in the final scene.I was so aggravated by the ending that I reduced my rating of this film to a 5.  Like Schubert's unfinished symphony, I'm left wondering why Sayles abandoned such a beautiful project.

However, if I would throw in a second word to describe this film, it would probably be slow. This is a well made and good looking film taking place in boring Alaska. Not much happens there and everyone seems occupied with their businesses. The main character, Joe, is a mellow guy partially detached from the community. Years ago, he was involved in a boat accident where two of his friends drowned. He hasn't been the same since. He has no friends, but begins a relationship with the outgoing Donna, a singer. It turns out that her daughter Noelle, closer in character to Joe, has always had a crush on her mother's new boyfriend. One day, Joe's stepbrother comes into town and asks Joe for help. He needs Joe to sail with him to meet some customers. It is obvious that the stepbrother is in some sort of trouble, but keeps Joe in the dark about everything so Joe decides to bring Donna and Noelle along for the trip. One night, when Joe catches his stepbrother watching their surroundings nervously, he forces him to explain everything. As his nervous behavior and sudden need for Joe implied, the stepbrother has been involved in some illegal activities and owes a lot of money. He took Joe along for the trip to help him sort everything out. It turns out that the people the stepbrother was dealing with are not the reasonable type. Without revealing too much plot, the situation becomes serious as the group is forced to abandon ship and flee from those customers that Joe's stepbrother talked about.All the elements slowly led up to this interesting point in the film. As expected, there is some suspense. As Joe, Donna, and Noelle hide on a secluded island with no means of communication, they realize that their lives have been totally messed up, without them ever knowing of any danger. So they try to survive. But the film loses the suspense it built up. Instead it focuses more on character development. It dwells on the mother-daughter relationship and their problems. The movie brings out Joe's and Noelle's characters and contrasts them with Donna's. The personalities of the protagonists are an essential part of the movie, but it seems that the film abandons its tone at times to develop those personalities. When you think the suspense will pick up, Limbo slows down again to focus on its characters. It doesn't do it poorly, in fact it does it well most of the time, but after a while it seems too much and too slow. It all works well in the end, however, because the ending reflects the attitudes and behaviors that have been built up until that point. All the characters have been hurt in some way, but because of their history they have learned to look at things in a different way. The ending is very good and very interesting. It perfectly compliments the feelings of the characters, but the question is which characters are right. It addresses the issue of positive thinking vs. negative thinking. Who do you trust, and what will happen as a result? It also depends on the way the person watching the film thinks.This is a good film. The character development is done well to make this highly interesting ending work. The acting is not excellent, but good. Even though the point of the film is to focus on personalities rather than suspense, it lags at times. I felt it needed a little more life. Limbo is a good film that may just be a bit too slow for most people. Overall a 7 out of 10.

The strokes he uses to sketch his characters in the opening scenes, though pleasantly chaotic, are entirely familiar.  Once again, the protagonist, Joe, is a stoic, principled character whose life centers on finding redemption for some profoundly tragic event in the past.  The setting, coastal Alaska, provides Sayles with adequate fodder for his favorite political issues, foremost among them the struggle for economic equality in a free market society.  In fact, the plot twist on which the film's conclusion turns - whether a scornful pilot will save the protagonists or reveal their location to the drug dealers trying to kill them - can be seen as a metaphor for Sayles' capitalist dilemma stick together with the other laborers or work against them to make a living wage.  We're encouraged to mull over the same issue when the fish-cleaning plant closes, or when Joe is ordered by his bosses to take an old comrade's repossessed boat out to fish.  And, on this count at least, he works with as much subtlety as he does in the best of his films.

The problem with the latter half of this film is that, simply, it belongs in an entirely different movie. It doesn't fit and for the remaining hour seems mighty awkward. But, again, this is John Sayles, and in the hands of a lesser director all might be lost, but the he extracts the best performances from David Strathairn and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio in the latter half of the movie.

Natural enough that a conclusion that so flagrantly violates viewer expectations of what a conclusion should be, and do, should meet with so much frustration, even anger, from so many viewers.But the viewer able to entertain a different sort of ending may be able to experience something quite extraordinary, nothing less than an existential epiphany of what it actually means to *be*, in the world.  For at the moment when the film ends, Sayles' protagonists have created a fullness of meaning, a fullness of love and compassion, *within*, and not falsely transcendent of that very moment.  And it is arguably not only illusory, but a downright lie to say that we are *ever* able to do more than this, though our ego spends its lifetime protesting otherwise.Very few films, independent or otherwise, shatter the web of samsara, the play of egoic illusion which fuels so much of our experience, and upon which benighted human activity rests.  Certainly, the Hollywood machine's machinations are bent on *furthering* the interests of samsara. Witness the almost constant barrage of weak messianism, nicely exemplified in that Matrix nonsense about Keanu Reeves' character being the one.  The only redemption offered in *that* film is from the need to confront the machine; Keanu enacts that confrontation *for* us, leaving us free to enjoy further illusion in the comfort of knowing that, since we're human, we will, we must, simply triumph over such illusion, in the end.  Keanu is just a prettier version (for most of us!) of the one that we all are.This sort of comfort is proffered through facile forms of closure in all the arts, in music even more egregiously than in film.  And I deem it proof enough of the triumph of our conditioning to the interests of such closure that so few of us can stomach what happens at the end of *Limbo*.For *Limbo* steadfastly refuses to offer up some closure that would be false to the actual experience of *lived* life.  We want to pretend that the characters, if we like them, don't *really* have to die, or if they do, we, immortal aesthetes that we are, will get a chance to relish, and properly subordinate their tragedy to our own ends.Well life doesn't work that way, and neither does Sayles' masterful film. And despite what many commentators have suggested, the film does not end in limbo.  The characters are either going to get rescued or shot; the conclusion is thus quite definite in its open-endedness.  But by not showing us *either* of those eventualities, Sayles gives us something much better, much more definite still.  For the love and mutuality we witness in the film's final moments is truer, more real, than the modalities of rescue or death could ever be.  And if we are willing to grant Sayles his donnee (would James?!), we may experience something quite extraordinary, something quite extraordinarily real.Thank you, John Sayles.  Thank you.

The mother finds out after she's been out on a couple of dates with a guy her daughter has crush on him and not only does she keep seeing him (???!!!!) she drags her daughter on a weekend boat trip (???!!!!) with a cozy little group of them. To a teenage girl, that's about as low as you can go. And her mother went there with righteous and untouchable glee in this screenplay. And then they're stranded on an island after days, DAYS, this teenage girl issues her first meager complaint and the mother immediately begins a rant about her own personal discomfort????? The movie is a near complete misunderstanding of female motivation and mother/daughter relationships. It's really, and unfortunately, a screenplay about why foster care exists.So I would have loved this movie if they'd shot Mastrontonio's character even before the boat and left the more interesting and worthy people to figure out their lives. And while we're on Mastrontonio, she's been given good reviews for this movie and I'm guessing it's because she can sing. Disclosure I'm not a fan of voices like hers that try to substitute Plath-like angst for, well, a decent singing voice, but that an actress tries to do anything else other act is often considered goddess-like by Hollywood (Watch Meg Ryan boil an egg!). I've never been impressed by Mastrontonio anyway, and I wasn't here, either.Sayles has made much better films than this one and I'm sorry Strathairn and Martinez couldn't have had their own show.

One of the amazing things about this film is that it was made in a period 1998-2001 when American independent and mainstream cinema was at a peak it had not reached since the early seventies Scorsese-Coppola era. It was churning out brilliant films such as American Beauty (1999), Being John Malkovich (1999), Memento (2000), American History X (1998) and Panic (2000) but despite this Sayles manages to produces this piece of festering rot.One of the many annoying aspects of the film is that Sayles cannot write. I'll admit he's not a terrible director (there are some scenes where he uses Alaska's natural beauty wonderfully) but when it gets to writing this guy stinks, anyone who witnessed his poor attempt at witty dialogue in Passion Fish (1992) can testify to that. The lines are as stale as the whole story and worse of all HIS CHARACTERS ARE ALL STEREOTYPES!!! Tell me how many times you've heard these ones - the guilt-ridden fisherman who lost men at sea years ago and now can't go back on a boat, the single mother/singer (she ruins Tom Waits' (Looking For) The Heart of Saturday Night by the way) who's had more bad relations than hot dinners and her daughter the deeply-depressed high-school outcast who cuts herself from time to time. Yes this film (as with most of Sayles' others) is drowning in stereotypical characters, something a hate with a passion. But I can understand the use for stereotypes in a complex story with a dense plot, if you have stereotypes as your characters the audience know these characters places and can get on with the story. The problem with Limbo is that it has neither a complex story nor a dense plot, it's a goddamn character development film! So why has he used characters we've seen in 101 films before in a genre which is all about developing interesting new characters? Because he doesn't know he's writing stereotypes, because he's a bad script writer.So all of a sudden after an hour and fifteen minutes of stale dialogue and poor character developing a story appears, and you'll never guess what kids, wait for it...It's actually quite an interesting story. Stereotype fisherman (now over his fear of boats), stereotype Mother and stereotype daughter decide on a nice boat trip with fisherman's stereotype shady half-brother. And guess what stereotype shady half-brother has a drug deal on the side, he gets shot and the other three have to bail ship for fear of the drug-dealers (probably Columbians called Carlos and Juan who have gold chains round their necks and have toothpicks in their mouths). They swim to the nearest island and for the last forty minutes it becomes a mildly interesting survival film. But it is too late for the audience's mind has already started to wonder after the poor start. And then Sayles commits celluloid suicide and doesn't end the movie, he leaves it on a cliff hanger (but this isn't Dynasty Mr. Sayles) and leaves the audience frustrated and annoyed. After sitting through two hours of sheer rubbish, giving our all to the film, wasting our own personal time watching it he screws us over, leaving us unsatisfied. I'm sure some people will say `Oh but doesn't he leave no ending so he leaves his audience in Limbo?' and the tagline to the movie `Limbo - a condition of unknowable outcome' does suggest that this may be his idea, but it really wouldn't surprise me if he came up with the name and tagline after he shot the film or wrote the script as a ruse to trick us into thinking that the movie is cleverer than it really is, when really what has happened is a writer has the start of a story (but still takes him over an hour to get to it) but not the end. This is the most fatal flaw Sayles makes.This is just basically a terrible version of Short Cuts set in a fishing village. So it gets 2 out of 10, because Alaska looks beautiful.

Before the movie was over I had already decided that I wanted it to end as soon as possible, and so when it came to the point that the ending was left open I really did not care because I was so glad to just leave the theater. Unfortunately I have not heard of any of John Sayles other films so I have only this one to base my opinion of him upon. Critically I can respect what he did with the ending, but the rest of the movie was just so uninteresting that it failed to make me care. I can watch movies and enjoy them critically- it's the only way I can enjoy `Citizen Kane`- because the brilliance of Orson Wells ideas and filmmaking techniques shine throughout the whole movie. In `Limbo' I honestly felt like Sayles was holding me hostage because he had a great idea for something that is not usually done at the end of Hollywood films. What Sayles must understand is that it is not enough to have a brilliant and unconventional ending but that you must also have a decent and intricately woven plot to keep the viewer interested so that by the end of the film it stays with them. As for closure, it is a very sensitive subject to be playing around with in Hollywood because it is so Non-Classical. The only way `The Fellowship of the Ring' got away with it and became a huge success is that audiences accepted the fact that the sequel would be arriving the very next year, and that the film was entertaining, unlike `Limbo'. I try to recall the films in classic cinema or any film in general that I have viewed that has not really brought about full closure in the end, and I believe I was satisfied with the picture. Because as long as the film works as a whole, then you do not need closure at the end. Life does not have closure, and films are stories of lives. I can probably name on one hand the sequels I have thought were of any value, because although the first film may not wrap up all the details of someone's life or what is happening, when the show is over so abruptly like this then you must think back about what you saw and appreciate why it ended that way. Unfortunately like I said I didn't see anything good in the first place. The only character of any worth in the film was Donna De Angelo, played by Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. The personality was lively and made me laugh, and I definitely connected with her character because she was the only one with any real sense of humanity in the film. The problem was her comedic lines were few and far between. Some of the supporting cast members were also great, but the focus of the film included excessively long scenes of fishing, her singing, and the Alaskan country. Perhaps Sayles would do a better job working for National Geographic, because the viewers do not need any real closure in a one hour documentary of the marsupial family.

His movies are not for all tastes, however, and much of his latest film seems languid and unfocused, even though it is filled with fine performances, beautiful majestic vistas of the Alaskan wilderness and an audacious assumption that the audience need not be wowed in the first fifteen minutes to ensure their continued interest.As with most of his films, Sayles employs a novelistic approach, patiently gathering the strands of his story together as he introduces us to each of his various characters.  Slowly, almost leisurely, we get to meet the people who occupy this Alaskan town as they take their place upon the canvas Sayles has painted.  Some emerge as major players in the tale; some burst forth for a brief moment then recede to the background. The main characters include a former fisherman, guilt ridden by the deaths of two of his friends while on a boat outing and an aging club singer, desperately attempting to cope with a failing career, a succession of loser boyfriends, and a deeply troubled teenaged daughter who barely tolerates her mother and who abuses herself by cutting gashes into her arms as a cry for understanding and some stability in her life.One of the problems with the narrative is that Sayles sets up a set of other characters and conflicts around these three main players, yet virtually drops them all when the three of them become stranded on an uninhabited island and the focus shifts entirely to them.  Unfortunately, neither the singer, Donna De Angelo (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), nor her daughter, Noelle (Vanessa Martinez), nor, especially, the fisherman, Joe Gastineau (David Strathairn), are sufficiently interesting in themselves to carry the weight of the whole drama.  What we lose is the richness provided by the Alaskan locals, be they fish canners suddenly left unemployed by the closing of a local plant, the tourist representative and the logging industry leader who clash over the age old issue of commerce vs. environment, or the endless stream of geriatric tourists drifting by in the background creating a surreal image for the foreground drama.  These are the elements that rivet our attention and it is just these elements that evaporate in the second half of the film.  The conventional family-relations drama we are left with provides insufficient compensation.Special note should be taken, however, of Mastrantonio's finely fleshed out interpretation of a mother struggling to come to grips with a myriad of problems and frustrations and just trying to find some personal peace and fulfillment in her world.  Strathairn, however, underplays his role so excessively that he often appears invisible in the film.  As the daughter, Martinez is winning and effective.The movie also tacks on a silly lady-or-the-tiger ending that, in the context of a more meaningful, daring film, might have been audacious and thoughtprovoking.  Here, however, it merely smacks of either last minute lack of inspiration or, (a more sinister possibility) simple authorial smugness.All in all, Limbo emerges as one of John Sayles's lesser cinematic achievements.

It is a poorly made film, and a failed experiment in filmmaking.Sometimes it is best to get to the point early on, and so I have attempted to do just that in this review.  If the makers of Limbo had kept to that idea, they could have saved themselves several million dollars and thousands of people would have 2 1/2 hours of their lives to spend in better circumstances.  Alas, it was not to be, so audiences will pay for their mistake.Depressingly, Limbo isn't just a bad movie; it is two bad movies.  The first revolves around a small Alaskan fishing town that is at the end of its spool.  The cannery is closing down and the fishing business itself provides only a risky living for those desperate enough to take their chances with its financial and physical risks.  One of those desperate souls is Harmon King, a down-and-out former fisherman looking to return to his old trade. Sadly for him, he owes a large amount of money to the local lodge owners, who have repossessed his boat.  They have hosted a wedding for the daughter of a tourism executive's daughter, which is being worked by handyman Joe Gastineau, torch singer Donna De Angelo, and Donna's daughter Noelle. Donna has the audacity to dump her bandmate/boyfriend onstage at the wedding, which is a good example of the selfishness that has estranged her from her daughter.  She hitches a ride into town with Joe and they begin an intimate relationship, while Donna ignores the continued warning signs that her daughter is slipping into serious depression.  Meanwhile, we meet the local bartender, keeper of sea stories, and also watch Harmon fight with Frankie and Lou (the lodge owners) over his boat.  They have lent the boat to Joe so that he can return to the sea 25 years after having two friends die while out with him on a fishing trip.  And finally, enter Smilin' Jack, the bush pilot Romeo with an eye for Donna and a dislike for Joe.Did you get all that?  It doesn't matter because, 90 minutes into the film, all but three of the aforementioned characters are erased from the movie. Even the histories of the characters kept on are eradicated.  It is as if they never existed, and the film begins again, this time centering on a sea jaunt by Joe, Donna, Noelle, and Joe's brother Bobby into the backwaters of Alaska's islands.  Bobby doesn't tell his passengers, but he is meeting some drug kingpins whose dope he lost and who are out for revenge.  When the meeting turns fatal, the three passengers must hide on a deserted island with little hope of rescue and winter closing in.  Slowly, ever so slowly, the drama of three hopelessly stranded people plays out, as anger, lust, and vulnerability each take their turn in the castaways' lives.It is apparent that writer/director John Sayles wanted to make a non-traditional sort of film, and he succeeds.  That is the only measure of success in the film, however, as some film making conventions should be followed.  Such as finishing any storyline that is started, or not creating ridiculous situations in order to squeeze some sort of character building through adversity out of your stars.  The dismissal of the entire first half of the film before any resolution makes the film seem overlong, and is wasteful of any emotion imbued in the characters discarded.  Likewise, once you have placed your chosen characters in adversity, it would help to allow some development by them, or give a reason why they are still the small people they were to start with.  The only personal discovery by the stranded family is that Noelle is an extremely gifted if morose storyteller; Donna doesn't notice that her emotional abandonment of Noelle has sparked her daughter's lonely talent.I feel I must add some meta-review here.  Several hundred other people and I were treated to free passes to this film.  I can honestly say that I have never seen so many people walk out in the middle of a free movie as walked out of Limbo.  As the film dragged on the remaining audience sank lower into their seats, muttering disparaging comments, and generally suffering the annoyance of an excruciatingly slow film.  In fact, I wish I had thought, the only way this film could get any slower is if the film broke, because, two hours in, the film broke.  Normally when the film breaks during a screening there is a lot of booing and hissing, and general disappointment amongst audience members.  When the film broke during Limbo there was a palpable wave of relief that swept the audience, with laughter and high fives passed around.  A number of moviegoers resembled prisoners who have noticed the prison guard's back has turned and made good their escape. And finally, once the film was restarted and the inconclusive end reached (which is supposed to place you and the cast in limbo, get it?  Wakka wakka wakka) there were people asking for free passes to another movie for sitting through the torture that is this film, and they got in for free.  Imagine how bad you'll feel if you pay for it.

After seeing his take on the small-town Texas persona in Lonestar, I was prepared to see Limbo. I was not prepared for how it would affect me.This is, quite simply, a masterful work of cinema and narrative. Unlike most directors, Sayles is brilliant and relentless in his purpose. He takes his time to set up the plot, diving right into the strange, shapeless lives of a group of fishermen and natives in Port Henry, Alaska. Everyone in town is forced to reminisce in one way or another. The town is suffering financially, and the way Sayles has his camera almost sneak up and hide behind characters in order to listen to what the locals are saying is genius.Of course, typical Sayles, the plot is almost completely unpredictable. It begins, like Lonestar, as a detailed look into the lives of a small Alaskan fishing town with the lonely, drifting lives of the inhabitants taking front stage. Then, midway the plot completely shifts gears and we get a tale of man vs. nature, the elements that threaten to destroy and overtake the fighting spirit of people. It is here that the cast truly shines. David Straitharin, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Vanessa Martinez are equally fantastic in their respective, so much so that it is impossible to imagine any other actor playing any of these parts. Sayles is masterful at casting and he proves that here unlike anything else he has done. The final third of the film rests heavily on the relationship between these three characters, so it is crucial that they relate well together and be believable. I couldn't ask for three better performances.In the end, this film is completely stamped with the unique style of John Sayles. Because he is so unpredictable, it is a truly satisfying feeling after seeing one of his films. You feel, not jilted and tricked like most films do, but happy and understanding what and why things happened. This is certainly a film I will be thinking about for awhile after seeing it and I can only hope that filmmakers like Sayles will continue to stick around. After all, these are the kind of films that need to be continued. It has soul, personality and a quality that can teach and inspire. A truly great film.

Then the rest is details. The scenery is beautiful though not overused. The weather is chilly and we can feel it perfectly well. The anxiety, the fear, the panic now and then are perfectly present and lively. The daughter what's more is fantasizing some kind of diary left behind by some previous runaway abandoned escapee of some sort. The film though tries to stick to the rhythm of that life when it is stranded like this in no place nowhere and it is rather slow, maybe too slow.

Not because he hits every ball out of the park, because he clearly doesn't; but because he never lets his few strikeouts compel him to try to hit a five-run homer the next time out. In an era marked by increasingly degraded and degrading notions of entertainment and storytelling - for pity's sake, as I write this, grown adults are waxing rhapsodic over a movie about a costumed billionaire-vigilante (!!) - Sayles understands that great drama is about the people we meet every day; the places we live in and how they shape us; the things that change, and the things that remain; and above all, about the human heart in conflict with itself. In LIMBO, he takes risks with his zig-zagging narrative most filmmakers simply aren't capable of, and reaps rewards of such profundity, and richness of feeling, that most audiences are too conditioned by junk-culture to recognize, let alone appreciate them. Some viewers have felt betrayed by LIMBO's seismic shifts in tone and direction, and the elliptical ending, but even that sense of betrayal speaks to how utterly absorbing and moving his handling of his Alaska-set story is, and how unblinking his observations of his characters. (You can only feel betrayed if you're deeply invested in the story that's been presented, after all.) Sayles' screenplay, like his direction, is so completely free of artifice as to seem transparent - his heroes and villains are separated only by their degrees of vulnerability and weakness under pressure - and his small cast of actors are working at the height of their gifts. David Straithairn, always underrated, has never been better, and young Vanessa Martinez is a quiet revelation. You won't forget these characters, or this movie, regardless of how the ending affects you. And though you hate to jinx his thus-far phenomenal career with red-carpet hullabaloo, maybe it's time to make it official and coronate John Sayles as the greatest moviemaker of our time. He may not need or want the crown, but Hollywood certainly needs to made to cry uncle and acknowledge it.

Thankfully, those people who adopt those views can't prevent tremendous film-makers like John Sayles from making movies which have something to say but refuse to hit you over the head with a baseball bat to get the message through. We have a director in Australia, Paul Cox, who like Sayles refuses to submit to the populist view that people don't want to think when they go to the movies and he has given us some of the most thought-provoking films ever made in Australia. Limbo is not one of John Sayles greatest achievements, but it's miles in front of the boring tosh that passes for entertainment these days. And isn't the last scene a metaphor for all our lives?

After a promising start it turns into a survival movie, quite gripping in its way.  Then it just stops.  The ending outraged me so much I actually shouted NO! when the credits appeared without warning, and I realised that I was never going to find out what happened to these people.  I went home in a rage at the director's cop-out, and wished I'd never bothered seeing it.I find it interesting to try to figure out why the indeterminate ending is so annoying in Limbo, and not (at least to me) in films such as Cast Away, Travels with My Aunt and many others which deliberately leave the future unresolved.  Maybe it's because Limbo became a suspense film, with the implicit promise of an eventual resolution and release of tension.  The others are not the character has been on a journey and stands at a cross-roads, ready to choose, and we enjoy watching them in that moment of choice that they have earned.  In Limbo, the family have been on a journey and now stand together united to face their fate - a rather nauseating moment that reminded me queasily of the end of Fatal Attraction - but they don't know what fate they have to face, so there is no resolution.  I don't think it would be so annoying if for example,  the only way out is to kill the baddies, and we see them reaching a decision about whether or not to do this, but never find out what that decision is.  that would be OK because we would have all the pieces there to say I think they would do this, because....  We don't have any of the pieces to know whether the plane is friend or foe, so it is just irritating.

I wanted to wring John Sayles' neck for sucking me in, once again, and then pulling the net out from under me--but then the light dawned.  What an incredible piece of art!This movie makes one think, feel, and marvel.  (No, not if you like typical Hollywood garbage.  If you like the standard fare on screen and TV, you will probably miss the whole point of this movie, and you won't feel the buzz afterward, either.)I don't know where to begin, so I'll just jump right into the middle somewhere.  I applaud the courage of everyone involved in this movie for giving it their best, knowing that they were working with art and not just popular fluff.  It doesn't seem that the purpose of this movie was to make money, but to create an experience--risky business, but wonderful art. (Today it is so difficult to find true risk takers, which, ironically, is also one of the movie's themes.)Sayles' choice of elements struck me personally, in much the same way that he first grabbed me with Secaucus Seven.  Sayles has a way of creating art that makes the audience feel a strong sense of identification.  I could feel the whole environment of the movie, as if I were actually there.  The presentation of scenery and characters was so REAL, so REAL.  I felt as if I knew the people and the places personally.  I could smell the sea air and damp smoke, feel the camaraderie at the bar and the dampness of the forest. (In fact, I had to pause the movie and leave the room to get a quilt during the cold, damp forest scenes--even though it's June.)  I could feel the despair of people in the characters' situations.  An added bonus was Mastrantonio's voice--I never knew she could sing.  The music touched me. (Thank you Mason Daring and MEM.)The characters were extremely realistic and believable.  Strathairn, Mastrantonio and Martinez all skillfully conveyed complex emotions, while managing to hold back enough to let the audience feel as well.As the movie began to coast along at a slow pace, I began to get itchy, and nearly fast-forwarded, but I now believe that the slow pace, the understatement, and the deliberate suspension of resolution that Sayles put us through contributed to the near epiphany I felt just after the movie ended.  One might sarcastically suggest that I was relieved that it was over, but that's not true.  It wasn't a feeling of relief at all.  It was a feeling of overwhelming emotion anger, at first, followed by awe.As in great literature, underlying a seemingly simple plot is a complex webwork of philosophical themes--in this case, all connected in some way to the idea of limbo, the term defined by the movie.  Why define the word at all?  Because it is the black side of the yin-yang symbol, which everything in the universe requires in order to define and prove the existence of its opposite.I apologize for meandering so much.  I was so taken by the movie that I felt the need to say something but I think it is important to demonstrate how the skills and talents of those involved in making the movie (most notably the writer/director/editor, actors, music director, cinematographer, and production designer) worked together to leave me awestruck.

On second viewing, I'm reconsidering this thought.  Many people think this ending is gimmicky or pointless, but it truly is consistent with a very subtle theme in the story, i.e. imagination.Noelle discovers that the story she is reading ends abruptly and too soon. Hence, she fills in the details from the imagination of her own mind. This is exactly what Sayles is asking the audience to do when this movie ends.Sayles is making the point that life is spent mostly inside our own heads. The beauty of this movie is not what the characters say or do, it's what they don't say and don't do.  I was struck by the scene where Joe Gastineau (Straitharn) meets his brother Bobby in the bar.  There isn't any teary-eyed reunion, nor any pent up rage to be released.  Obviously these guys are more strangers than friends, but they have history together and they acknowledge this in their meeting.  It's a very understated scene, and very un-hollywood.There are many points in the movie where the character is obviously thinking about something, but doesn't state what is on his/her mind.  An example is early on when Noelle learns that Joe got a couple of people killed in a fishing accident.  Later when she's talking to him about his earlier life, you can tell she is thinking about asking him about this, but holds back.In an earlier comment, someone purported that the characters aren't realistic.  This comment is comical.  I'm not sure I've seen more realistic characters than the ones that regularly show up in Sayles' movies.  Most movies have characters blurt out everything on their minds, when in real life people are much more enigmatic and live mostly within their private minds.The dialogue about Disneyland and a real live Alaska fantasyland is juxtaposed against the fantasies and imaginations within the minds of the characters.  The character portrayals within Limbo are every bit as complex and multi-layered as the ones in Lone Star.  That is why I rate this movie on a level with his earlier work.

Finally, since there was nothing else in the store more appealing, I picked it up. I was pleasantly surprised to see that John Sayles had written and directed it as I had just seen MATEWAN, and loved it. As the story unfolded, I found that I liked getting to know the people. This is an art that is often never attempted and even less often achieved. It is a fine line between interest and boredom, if the storyteller is having the patience to develop his charactors. I kept getting more and more curious as the movie went on as to what was going to happen next. Then the big plot twist occured with Strathairn's brother and the story shifted into another gear. Now you get to see the world more completely through each of the 3 main charactors eyes. It was great...each charactor was equally complex and rivoting to me. The ending was a total shock. I was iniatially disappointed, but in retrospect.... I love it. I have always advocated unpredicatability as a key element of a good film and there is no way to see that ending coming.

LIMBO is one of the best movies I've seen this year, with all the usual Sayles virtues; complex themes, intelligence, three-dimensional characters, believable dialogue, and excellent use of location.  Within the first five minutes of the film, I was laughing not just at the humor(people who say Sayles is without humor are missing something) but in recognition of the real people who occupy the screen.Sayles movies tend towards two types; his ensemble movies(RETURN OF THE SECAUCUS SEVEN, MATEWAN, EIGHT MEN OUT, CITY OF HOPE, LONE STAR) and stories which follow only a few people(LIANNA, PASSION FISH, THE SECRET OF ROAN INISH).  LIMBO starts out as if it's an ensemble film, but gradually turns into the second type by narrowing its focus to just three characters; Joe(David Strathairn), the handyman with a dark past, Donna(Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), the road-weary singer, and Noelle(Vanessa Martinez), her resentful daughter, when they get stuck in the Alaskan wild.  Some may feel this is two movies in one, and two unconnected movies at that, but the key to the second is buried in the first; when a wealthy businessman hoping to lure the tourist trade talks about taking theme parks to the next step - allowing people to live through their own adventure.  That is what Joe, Donna, and Noelle do, and perhaps the businessman would be surprised at the result.  But maybe not.One other hallmark of Sayles films is the performances.  Strathairn is a Sayles regular, but this is the first time he's been in the starring role, and this is his best performance yet.  You can see how his fatalism can be cheering in everyday life and yet discouraging when faced with desperate circumstances, and how his knowledge of survival skills comes at a price; these are skills he hoped he'd left behind after quitting fishing.  It's nice to see Mastrantonio back in a lead role again, and she sings quite well too.  She even gets to act while singing(watch the look on her face when Noelle walks out during her concert).  But the surprise here is Martinez. This is only her second film(she played the younger version of Elizabeth Pena in LONE STAR), but she brings a complex emotional power to a stereotypical role.  This is someone who truly has seen too much, and you hurt for her, especially during the diary scenes.One last thought; the controversial ending.  I can understand why some people feel it's a cheat and don't like it, and don't think any less of them.  I do feel, however, it fits the movie.

Limbo is an incredibly well crafted movie in which simple techniques belie a complexity of character.  The people in this story are not beautiful or rich, but they are interesting, tortured souls whose tales are told with a slow eloquence. Drama unfolds at a ponderous pace that feels much more like real life than the staccato cuts of so many modern movies.Small towns and the big problems of their inhabitants are what make a Sayles film so memorable.  He pulls from his actors emotions that are allowed to ferment.  Limbo takes place in a seaside town in Alaska that straddles the old and new worlds.  Port Henry is full of schemers, fishermen, barflies, and other characters drawn to this rugged frontier.The plot is too complex and enjoyable to reveal even in the smallest sense. I don't mind saying, though, that visually this film will probably have no comparison this summer.  Sayles knows how to frame a shot, and he doesn't mind giving the scenery time to sink into your psyche.  Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, David Straithairn, and Vanessa Martinez, all deserve praise for their poignant acting, and the great Kris Kristofferson once again makes the most of a small but important part.It's a shame that because the big new theaters are busy showing the garbage that Hollywood has offered this summer, this brilliant movie will probably only show in smaller theaters without the newest sound systems.  Don't let this keep you from seeking out Limbo and being reminded what a film not made by a committee of accountants and lawyers can be.

His 1996 film Lone Star is flat out brilliant, and the woefully underseen Men With Guns represented another triumph in storytelling and prose.  Limbo follows this tradition in the representation of a stretch of Americana that we think we all know, Alaska. Weaned on Northern Exposure and Sea World exhibits, Sayles takes us behind the facade with this story of a fisherman with a troubled past (David Strathairn) who begins a tentative romance with lounge singer (luminous Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio). The film shows us the other side of Alaska.  The mills and factory closings, the theme park future that Alaska might be subjected to, and the constant state of unknown future for the people of the land (the limbo of the title). When the fisherman takes the singer and her daughter on boat trip though unsettled land, the journey turns ugly and the three become stuck on a remote island(again, the limbo of the title). This part of the film is what Sayles excels at.  It is at that point when the characters go under the microscope and reveal what they are truly made of. Sayles's strength is in his characters, a gift that few writer-directors even try to find, much less have.  I was hopelessly drawn to each character,  interested in what happens to them and why. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio has been far away from films lately.  She first caught my eye in The Abyss, and there I was hopelessly forced to fall in love with her and the mighty talent she holds.  With Limbo, Mastrantonio commands the screen once again. She's just great in her scenes with David Strathairn, and it makes you wish she could be in every film.  She also gets to display a very delicate singing voice. Also of note is young Vanessa Martinez as Mastrantonio's daughter.  It's a role that's very complex, involving alienation and self-abuse, ideas and emotions that any other actress her age would fumble like a Green Bay Packer.  The whole cast is perfect, but those two stand out with sheer talent. It's the ending of Limbo that the film will be remembered by.  The movie is packed with symbolism, and Sayles continues that idea with his finale.  It was a blast to see a packed audience react with such horror at the ambiguous ending, a small treat of theater-going.  The ending is a bold experiment, and honestly it is fitting with the rest of the picture(I do understand it's purpose).  But I just spent two+ hours feeling, caring, loving these characters...

Overall an exciting film especially if you have seen a lot of films recently.Regarding the controversial ending, I have to agree with what Sayles apparently said recently that he could not end it any other way.  Any other choice would be anticlimactic.  I was impressed by the director's courage at choosing what he did.Unless you just gotta see Phantom Menace one more time, then this films should be on the Don't Miss list.

During the title sequence we are shown a documentary of life in Alaska and the fishing industry that dominates the state.Noelle De Angelo (Vanessa Martinez) is the daughter of Donna De Angelo (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio). Donna and her daugher are roamers. Donna falls in love easily and tends to move from boyfriend to boyfriend, dragging her daughter with her wherever she goes.At the start of the film we find Donna, a singer, breaking up with her boyfriend and fellow band mate. This is the the usual for Noelle. It just means packing up and going back home.Noelle is obviously resentful of Donna. Their relationship is essentially the center of the film. Noelle is a depressed girl--always contemplating the detachment in her relationship with her mother.Donna meets Joe (David Stradheim), an ex-fisherman and co-worker of Noelle. They seem to develop genuine feelings for each other. Joe is a man trying to come to terms with events in his past. He is a somber, logical, no-frills kind of guy.One day, Joe's half-brother Bobby comes to town and convinces Joe to help him out on a boat run. Joe is never told the specifics of the mission but goes along with his brother's wishes, taking Noelle and Donna.The mission turns out to be drug related. Bobby warns Joe and as Joe is about to warn the women, Bobby is shot and killed.Thusly, the fight for survival begins. Joe, Donna and Noelle dive into the cold waters and begin a two-week survival mission on a deserted Alaskan island.It is here, on the island, that Sayles begins to get into the crux of his thesis. Slightly obvious, but very effective, metaphors between humans and fish are drawn throughout the film. Both humans and fish are in a constant struggle for survival--their lives dependent on the behavior and actions of others and our atmosphere. Everything is unpredictable. Everything is about uncertain outcomes. We are always in limbo.On this island, Noelle finds a diary which belonged to a girl who once lived in the deserted cabin they now call home. From it, she reads everynight. The thing that is admirable about Sayles is that there is really no other screenwriter in Hollywood that is better than he. Just when you think that the tale being told in the diary is a little to obviously similar to the story of the very people trapped on the island, Sayles subverts that thinking.This is the story of Noelle coming to terms with her relationship with her mother. They are struggling to stay alive, to try and establish a union. To not die. Vanessa Martinez gives what is easily the best performance of the year. The camera stays on her for minutes upon minutes--and as she reads the self-reflective diary entries, her heart bleeds and the tears roll down her cheeks.The movie is filled with genuinely funny humor and explorations of characters that is uncannily real. If there is one fault to the film, it is probably it's very strength sometimes it rings a little dry. But rarely do you get to see a film that so beautifully comments on our status as a struggling species of mother nature--every second of our lives unpredictable, dependent on external forces (physical and emotional).As a fan of Sayles' writing--mainly because I enjoy the sociological nature of his works--I can sometimes tell where he is going with things. I heard the ending was one of the most shocking endings people have ever seen in film.Limbo is about uncertain outcomes. And in those final two minutes of screen time, the audience really has no clue what will happen to these people. Sayles' decide to do something--which I expected--that few filmmaker's choose to do. I won't reveal it here, but it is very appropriate, albeit unconventional.

But it would be worth the effort. John Sayles and Haskell Wexler have worked together before (Matewan, The Secret of Roan Inish), and the combination of Sayles's writing and directing with Wexler's lensing again work to tell a compelling and intriguing story. From the slow sequential appearance of the letters of the title to the beginning of the end credits a number of characters are fleshed out.Not the least of them is the town itself - the site of gold-mining activity in the mid-1800's to lumber and fishing industry in the present. But both the logging and fishing industry have fallen on hard times. Tourism seems to be the town's main chance for survival. One character remarks that History is our future and a tour executive tells a logging representative to think of Alaska as a nature park in an attempt to illustrate why he doesn't mind timber-cutting in the interior . . . as long as the exterior appears pristine to his monied clientele.A sense of ingrained fatalism permeates a town bar where varied stories of injuries and deaths from the unyielding Alaskan environment are spun out. Bobby Gastineau (Casey Siemasko), half-brother of Joe Gastineau (David Strathairn), blows through the bar after an absence of some time, explaining he didn't want to be there in the winter months when people might just take out a gun and kill themselves. He doesn't miss a beat when he's told someone did just that earlier in the year - Proves my point.Donna (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) and Noelle (Vanessa Martinez) de Angelo are a mother & daughter living together on the move. Donna is a singer with no illusions about ever making it big. She's also not very fortunate in her choice of male companions - by her own admission and that of her daughter. She breaks up with her current beau by dedicating a Dear John-style song to him. After finishing the song, she walks off the stage leaving him to finish the performance with the rest of the band, and catches a lift with Joe.By the time the film gets into the relationships between Joe and Donna and Noelle we feel in familiar territory . . . but by the time the end credits run there is a high probability that you will be in L I M B O. The title is very appropriate - in more than one sense - although it might not seem that way until the last reel has unspooled. A very thoughtful and thought-provoking film, the type of which is not often seen in America - but should be.  "},{"Title":"One of Sayles' best","Date":"3 March 2011","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Thriller","Review":" Into a limbo large and broad, since called The Paradise of Fools, to few unknown. &#x96; John Milton This is one of John Sayles' best film. All the usual John Sayles flaws are here &#x96; a rather plain aesthetic, shallow socialism, dated radicalism etc &#x96; but these should be overlooked. The actual narrative structure of the film is genius.Sayles opens on a school of fish, closely packed and teetering on the brink of suffocation. Later we will see them flopping about, dying on dry land. Their plight is mirrored to the inhabitants of small town Alaska, who face job cuts, the effects of mechanization and the encroachment of big tourist and logging companies. Like the fish, everyone here is slowly going extinct, their natural environment changing. This leads to several characters evolving different means of survival. These means of survival will get more desperate and violent as the film progresses, characters switching jobs, turning to trafficking drugs, murder etc. In other words, everyone in Limbo is caught in some form of limbo, Sayles documenting the lengths people will go in order to break free of their uncertainty (and to inject some modicum of hopefulness into the circumstances they find themselves).The film focuses on three characters an ex fisherman, a club singer called Donna, and her daughter. Suffocation or drowning motifs orbit around each of them. For example, the ex fisherman lost his friends/family in a drowning accident, an event which put his own life in stasis. Likewise, not only is Donna's own career in limbo, the woman teetering between unemployment and stardom, but the status of her romantic life is always intermediate, the film opening with her being dumped by yet another boyfriend.As the film progresses, Donna and the fisherman will strike up a relationship, each rescuing the other from limbo. But this relationship, and their very survival, will then be swiftly called into question, as they're eventually marooned on an island. Throughout the film, individuals, corporations, couples, loners etc are all pushed onto a kind of precipice of uncertainty, always trapped between rescue/survival and death/extinction.The film's first half is radically different from its second half. In the first half, Sayles uses a multi-threaded narrative in which we're bombarded with information and characters. This is Altman territory, Sayles forcing us to tease out fragments of plot, the director relishing our confusion. We have no idea who our lead characters are, or what indeed the film is about.Nevertheless, important information is being conveyed here. A narrator welcomes us to America's last frontier and praises the country's natural wonders, but Sayles' ironic imagery conveys the opposite, treating us to images of Alaska's eradication, men in tacky animal suits, tourists lining up for tickets, and a barrage of inauthentic, cheap, tourist goods. Alaska's real nature is being bulldozed, and with it all authentic experience.As tourists descend upon Alaska, Sayles links them to dying salmon caught in nets and later dead fish hurling along conveyor belts. While this is going on, businessmen in charge of logging companies and tourist boards discuss things. We want to develop themes here, one says, speaking of his desire to set up little tourist theme parks. As he talks, assistants and servants dance about, tending to his every need. But these businessmen will be swiftly discarded in favour for the real Alaskan experience, Sayles focusing on a group of characters marginalised by gender, sexuality, race, age, economics etc. These characters, most of whom are disadvantaged, use a variety of different tactics to subvert or use to their own benefits the discourses at work around them. Their little battles are then morphed into the plight of three characters, the fisherman, Donna and her daughter, who find themselves stranded on an island. Existing off the tourist footpaths, this is the real Alaska experience (People pay money to go on trips like this!), the trio fighting off both wild nature and human competition.The island the trio find themselves on is called Kuleshov Island. We recall Russian film theorist Lev Kuleshov's Kuleshov effect, in which an audience is allowed to imbue blank images with their own story, emotions and effects. Kuleshov himself made a film, very similar to Limbo, titled By The Law, in which a group are stranded in Alaska and share a cabin in the wilderness. What Sayles does is use the Kuleshov effect to position the audience such that we resolve the film's story. Will our trio be rescued, or will they be sold out by a character called Smiling Jack (his name is itself suggestive of either benevolence or fiendish scheming - we choose)? Mirrored to this uncertainty is the film's embedded narrative. Here, Donna's daughter finds the diaries of a little girl who herself died on Kuleshov Island. This story-within-a-story is narrated by Donna's daughter who, when she reaches the diaries incomplete end, completes the story herself by imagining/constructing the rest of the plot. In other words, she completes the girl's fate as we complete the fate of the current Kuleshov trio.So what we have is an ensemble (society) which is bulldozed to make way for the modern experience, a simulacrum of a dying reality. This abstraction is reversed by a fable-like story in which a small fragment or representation of society fight for survival on an island. Here, a trio symbolically battle over their fate (the fisherman's a dour realist, Donna's a blind optimist and the daughter is an artist/dreamer). Kuleshov style, their fate is then left up to us. This, of course, like Sayles other implicative narrative (Passion Fish), directly implicates us in their plight, and enfolds us into the film. We, and cinema, are a part of the problem and a part of the solution.8.5/10 &#x96; Sayles trades literal sermonizing for something more abstract. Ignore the film's many flaws. What Sayles is doing here is very rare. Worth two viewings.

Through the half-brother's stupidity, they become hunted and are forced to spend several weeks on a deserted island in Alaska. The daughter gets sick. She reads a discovered diary but is actually making up the story as she goes along.  Finally they see hope of rescue, and as the three are standing on the beach, tired and hungry, hopefully watching the plane come towards them, the screen goes blank as the movie ends. We are to conclude that the rescue was actually the crooks gunning them down. But we're not sure.  Maybe they were rescued and lived happily ever after.
