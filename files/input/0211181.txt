[{"Title":"Cruella DeVil is at it again...","Date":"9 January 2003","Score":"12 out of 13 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family","Review":"  I saw the original 101 Dalmatians 3 times while en route from England back home to the USA and I loved it. So when I saw there was a new dalmatians movie, 102 Dalmatians, I was elated and when I saw it, I was NOT disappointed. In fact, I liked this version even better than the first. Glenn Close's performance as Ella who has been imprisoned for 3 years for dognapping but who received behavioral modification but reverts to Cruella when Big Ben's chimes go off, is delightfully dastardly. And the performance by Gerard Depardieu as the loathsome LaPelt is extraordinary. But the best performances, the ones who take the cake are those by the Dalmatians, real or created, especially Oddball, the spotless dalmatian puppy who is obsessed with S-P-O-T-S. The scene where she goes berserk when she sees a black and white sweater on a puppet in a Punch & Judy show is hilarious. There were scenes in which it looked like the puppies were in real danger but the magic lies in the fact that, when you read the credits, you realize those scenes were created; no puppy was ever in danger. I recommend this movie highly and I should; I've seen it at least 7 times and I also have the video.

This one follows where the original left off. Cruella Ella DeVille is kept in prison, and a group of scientist have altered her mind, turning her from evil to a good. Sadly, when the Big Ben rings its chimes, compassionate little Ella turns back to evil Cruella, with plots to capture more puppies for her Poppy Coat and for vengeance.Of course, this one adds one more puppy to the 101 others. Sadly only one of the puppies from the first makes it here (of course, he's full-grown now), it's none other than Dipstick. Besides the dog, Cruella and her stuttering butler Alonzo (Tim McInnerny), no other character from the first film returns for this sequel. The plot, if you removed some elements, is basically similar to the first film. Making this a formulaic sequel, but let's not get to harsh in reviewing this. You got to admit it still has some entertainment value, despite the flaws. The puppies are cute, as always, and some of the laughs are well enjoyable for the kiddies.So overall, not a brilliant flick, but a fun one for the family.Rating *** out of 5.

Seeing as how she is a dog lover and is riveted to the TV screen every time she sees a commercial or TV show with a puppy, I figured how could I go wrong?I was sadly disappointed.  I found that the movie tried too hard to be dark and sinister....Cruella got way too much screen time and the puppies, too little.  The movie just wasn't much fun.  Amazingly, my daughter got an hour or so of entertainment from this film, and then got horribly bored.  We ended up leaving before the movie was finished, so I'm not even sure how it ended.The movie was cute, but it ran way too long for the younger set who have a reduced attention span.  More time should have been devoted to the puppies and their antics, and less to Cruella and her scheming.  I don't believe I was the only one who felt this way....as my daughter and I were leaving the theatre, I noticed two youngsters fast asleep.  Not a good testimonial for a children's film.Save this one for a video rental so your kids can fast forward through the boring bits before they, too, fall fast asleep.

She even has all of her fur coats placed in the dungeon of the extraordinary castle she inhabits.But it wouldn't be a &#145;Dalmatian' movie without the subterfuge and machinations of Cruella and you know that something will change her behaviour modification. And now she needs one extra puppy (hence 102 Dalmatians) to complete her nefarious scheme this time round.Ioan Gruffudd is instantly appealing as the hero of the film that runs the `Second Chance' dog shelter.  Though he was in `Titanic' and in last year's television version (as Pip) of `Great Expectations' I didn't recognize him; well, he was &#145;Fifth Officer Lowe' in `Titanic' and I didn't see `Great Expectations' so I am not terribly surprised.Gerard Depardieu does a delightful turn as the furrier-pawn of Cruella.  He prances and postures in the most outlandish and outrageous of fur clothing you have ever seen &#150; and does it well.  His 'Wicked Witch of the West' homage is hilarious.Tim McInnerny is superb is Cruella's not-so-evil henchman &#150; he was also &#145;Alonzo,' Cruella's butler, in `101 Dalmatians' and you may also recognize him from all of the `Black Adder' Brit-Coms.  He plays his usual bumbling, good-hearted, somewhat dim-witted character to great effect.Oscars for costuming are generally given for the entirety of the costuming in a film.  This is unfortunate as the clothing worn by Glenn Close is amazing &#150; it is incredibly detailed (note her handcuffs when she is being released from the Behaviour Modification Clinic) and worthy of such an over-the-top character.  Her clothing alone deserves at least an Oscar nomination.Animation holds a special place in my heart &#150; but comparing this film to the original animated film is like comparing apples to orangutans  it can't be done.  Suffice it to say that `102 Dalmatians' is even better than the film version of `101 Dalmatians' that came out in 1996.  There is a lot to like here  from the sight gags, the dialogue, and the costumes to the casting - it is a good film for the whole family.

One thing that I found interesting was the director's drive and motivation to complete the project without quiting. Glenn Close has done another incredible job portraying Cruella De Ville. Her performance was so incredible that she made me angry everytime she did something evil to one of the dalmatians; when this happens, you know you have a good actress on your hands. Kudos to newcomers Ioan Grufford and Alice Evans as they pull off performances, which make them look like veterans. There performances were so great I could mistake them for naturals. These two have a lot to offer and are here to stay.

However, the premise is as old as they get boy finds girl, boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl again, and they all live happily ever after. Of course, I'm not giving anything away here because the movie is not about the humans; it's about the dogs and one bird.  And you can't leave out the bird. The bird is the real star of the movie. His name is Waddlesworth, and he is a MacCaw that does more than just talk -- he converses. The voice is that of Eric Idle (of Monty Python fame). Waddlesworth thinks he's a dog and cannot fly and is the comic relief for the movie, adding asides for our enjoyment.This film is better than 101 Dalmatians, which in its own right was very good, and both children and adults will enjoy it. It is pure entertainment. My teenager and six-year-old both liked it and said Waddlesworth was their favorite character. This is typical Disney entertainment Wholesome with just enough adult humor for mom and dad, excitement for the teenagers, and tenderness for the younger ones.

She tires her best but for stupid reason, which never gets explained in the movie, the ticking of Big Ben (the London tower clock) she goes mad and goes back to her evil self. After she had gotten out of jail, and before she turned back to her old self, she helped organize a puppy safe house. After she goes back she once again wants more dalmatians and although different in action, same in story as far as her getting them stolen and all attempts are captured in goofy glory as we see a less funny version of part one over again.Production was bad in this one, definitely a lower budget, and no where near the time and effort and talent devoted into this one. The music was bad, the acting was bad (for the most part) and its just a waste of time. Sequels often suck, so its not that big of a deal, you should know what you are getting.Glenn Close did a great job again, but her character was written badly here, so her acting couldn't save it. Most of the acting was mediocre at best. Ben Crompton did a good job as Ewan and thats about the only person that stood out. Eric idle as the voice of that stupid bird was annoying too.This movie is something you might shut your youngins up with for an hour and a half but it's a truly inferior film to its predecessor.

Cruella deVil (Glenn Close) is released from prison after being cured of her obsession with fur by a psychologist named Dr. Pavlov (ugh!). But the cure is broken when Cruella hears the toll of Big Ben, and she once again goes on a mad quest to make herself the perfect coat out of dalmation hides.This movie is bad on so many levels, starting with the fact that it's a Thanksgiving family schlock movie designed to suck every last available dime out of the Disney marketing machine. Glenn Close over-over-over-over-acts as Cruella. With all that she had to put up with in this movie -- the lame script, the endless makeup, getting baked in a cake at the end -- I hope they gave her an extremely-large paycheck.(Speaking of which, where in the world are you going to find a fur coat factory, a bakery with a Rube Goldberg assembly line, and a candlelight restaurant all located within the same building -- as you do in the climax of this film?) Of course, the real stars of the movie are supposed to be the dogs. They serve as the Macaulay Culkin's of this movie, pulling all the stupid Home Alone gags on the villains. (Biting them in the crotch, running over their hands with luggage carts, squirting them with icing, etc., etc., etc., ad nauseum.) I have to admit, the dogs were fairly good actors -- much better than the humans.Gerard Depardieu is completely wasted in this movie as a freaked-out French furrier. The two human dog lovers -- rehashed from the earlier film, but with different actors -- are completely boring. When they have a spaghetti dinner at an Italian restaurant, the movie cuts back and forth between the two lovers, and their dogs at home, watching the dinner scene from Lady and the Tramp. I thought to myself, Oh please, don't go there! I half-expected the humans to do a satire on the Lady and the Tramp dinner scene -- as Charlie Sheen did in Hot Shots Part Deux -- doing the spaghetti strand kiss, pushing the meatball with his nose, etc.And don't get me started on the annoying parrot with Eric Idle's voice.The costumes were nominated for an Oscar, and the costumes in the movie *are* good.

She is totally awesome,and totally believeable as she makes her transition from almost sickly sweet to gleefully evil. Alice Evans does a fantastic job as Cruella's stern, yet humorous probation officer who is less-than-thrilled about her new client. And Ioan Gruffudd is perfect as the slightly naive dog-lover who is torn between wanting to believe that Cruella has turned a new leaf, and being head-over-heels in love with her probation officer. Tim McInnerny makes a re-apperance as Cruella's flustered, frightened butler, but this time he gets to have a shining moment as he fights a bad guy, and helps to save the day. The only person I had a problem with was Gereld Depardieu... don't get me wrong, he's a great actor, but honestly, I think this role was beneath him. LePelt is stupid and snibbering, practically in love with Cruella and his jokes (i.e. the tiger head on his pants in one scene) fall hopelessly flat. I think Mr. Depardieu should have demanded some intelligence put in this role...  I can look past LePelt because Cruella and the others are so great, and the story line is charming, and the animals are once more, terrific.

He previously made the animated Tarzan. Close plays De Vil as the victim of cruelty especially since she came across as willing to change. Depardieu is a valuable French actor who is forgettable as this foolish lout. Social worker Alice Evans is given the personality of a bean bag. She obviously doesn't believe in second chances and coins De Vil for crime before she is even willing to act upon it. Ioan Gruffudd appears as the latest spotted dog lover and the role is every bit as charming as fleas are to dogs. The production values are passable but the freshness is gone after it translated to a live version before.

Gerard Depardieu - I didn't really know about his performance as the French fur designer. But one of the greatest performances that I like in the whole movie is Glenn Close as Cruella.

The whole movie was quite funny, and on my view, better than the animated one. But there was actually no need for a second one. First of all, if Cruela is returning, don't cure her and make her insane again. Just make her break away from jail and that's a rap. I thought it was not very funny. It's supposed to have only one original puppy returning. I'd expected that it should be Lucky, since he was the most appealing, and besides, having Roger and Anita back too. However, they decided to have a complete recasting and adding not really one hundred, not even one hundred and two, but only THREE puppies, and a parrot that thinks he's a dog (clever). Gerard Depardieu's part was pointless. At the end, Cruella suffers way too much, way too humiliating and way too exaggerated to be true. She gets baked inside a giant cake. That was a desperate attempt of physical humor, trying to imitate the same effect from the first one. That just didn't work. It was too much over the top, and not too funny. I actually felt sorry about Cruella.

I saw it as part of a double feature with The Emperor's New Groove, and the audience that laughed so hard during that film was strangely silent during this one.The film has two saving graces  Waddlesworth, the macaw who thinks he's a dog, and Oddball, the Dalmatian puppy with no spots.  I was partial to Waddlesworth before even seeing the film, owning a macaw myself.  With a voice provided by Eric Idle, Waddlesworth barks instead of squawks, and translates the canine language into English for the benefit of his humans.  Oddball is a puppy who wishes she had spots.  It's simply adorable when she sights her spotless reflection in a mirror and whimpers.  Also cute is how she takes to wearing a spotted sweater.

In 102 Dalmatians' case, no it isn't. This is not a terrible film, but it is not a good one either. I actually expected this movie to be worse than it's predecessor, but, hey, it wasn't. It was better. But, that is not even a compliment. It would be pretty easy to beat the standards of 101 Dalmatians, so is this film anything special? No, no, no!After a spot of therapy Cruella De Vil (Glenn Close) is released from prison a changed woman. Devoted to dogs and good causes, she is delighted that Chloe (Alice Evans), her parole officer, has a Dalmatian family and connections with a dog charity. But the sound of Big Ben can reverse the treatment so it is only a matter of time before Ms De Vil is back to her incredibly ghastly ways, using her new-found connections with Chloe and friends.Glenn Close is superb in her role of Cruella, that is one very good about the movie, which earns it a higher rating than it otherwise would've got. Add to that a cool theme song and a hilarious finale in which Cruella gets caked, and you may have a good movie. But, what about the originality? You can search this film and find nothing new, nothing much has changed from the first film. And what about the laughs? There aren't any of them until the end, and all the way until the finale, the film overflows with unfunny 'gags' that'll have the audience snoring. Also, no points to Ioan Gruffudd, who wears shorts through the entire film and looked to me like a school boy than a grown adult.102 Dalmatians earns very, very high on the snooze factor.

This was not really that fun because it's adults running around trying to act like cartoons instead of just actual human beings, I understand they're trying to make sure that it's appealing to the kids, but it's ridicules to see the way these actors are behaving in the film.

Also, as cute as the puppies were, it just works more for the animation, it sounds stupid, but it's just not as believable without the cartoon and their personalities being in the mix.

Chloe, her probation officer, also is handling the case of one of the caretakers of The Second Chance Dog Shelter, which is about to be evicted.  After she meets the head of the shelter, we see signs of a possible romance.Problem  the facility that rehabilitated Cruella has discovered that their animals revert to their former behavior if they hear Big Ben, even if it was only on TV.  Chloe's office is near Big Ben ...Glenn Close was good again, though not quite as enjoyable as she was in the first movie, because most of the time she was calm and decent (or maybe just pretending).  She did go crazy briefly early in the movie from reminders of her old life.  Gerard Depardieu made a delightfully nasty fashion designer, though I didn't think he reached his full potential, given that he acted like a WWE wrestler when introduced.  Another standout performance comes from Eric Idle, the voice of Waddlesworth, a talking bird who lives at the dog shelter because he thinks he is a Rottweiler (later he discovers the truth; he's actually a Retriever).  The dogs (mostly Dalmatians, but also shelter residents of other breeds or mixes of breeds) seemed quite intelligent. I have to believe, though, that some of their talent came not from training, but from the use of animatronic substitutes or perhaps computer wizardry.  The canine characters seemed almost human; some were capable of operating machinery, which added significantly to the physical comedy, most of that near the end.  Alonzo, Cruella's butler, got banged up a lot and had more and more bandages as the movie progressed.Several interesting scenes  Cruella, newly released from prison, imagines that all of London, including the cars and Big Ben, is white with black spots.

The 1996 film 101 Dalmatians was a remake and now they're doing a sequel to a remake? That is seriously quite odd. Even though this movie is much better than 101 Dalmatians from 1996, I still don't really see a reason to sequelize the movie. Anyway I really didn't see much values in this family film, apart from good ol' Glenn Close and the dogs. Yes, the dogs are still very cute and make the movie bearable enough. However, the story is absurd, the typical predictability deal is here in this movie and I didn't laugh very much. Apart from the ending where Cruella literally gets baked, this film is pretty much comedy-free. Kids will find it hard to laugh at this flick and to generally enjoy this film too. Even they're little minds will not be tricked by the movies dotty silliness. Adults will be dragged along by kids to see this sequel, but I'm sure none of them will think too much of it. Sure, 102 Dalmatians has some good points - the groovy opening song, Glenn Close's excellent performance, the funny ending and the cuteness of the dogs &#150; but ultimately it doesn't succeed. This is a sequel that you will only be bothered watching while you're one a plane or a boat or something just to pass the time. I'll ask again, someone please tell me the point of this movie?

Her Dalmatian owning parole officer is suspiciousof her, but she manages to gain her backing by donating to a dog shelter.

Glenn Close's performance is the best thing about the movie - she is superb as Ms. DeVil in a film that obviously doesn't deserve her. But, the story is flat, the laughs are regulary unfunny and most of the actors are horrible and talk so fast that I could barely understand them. The film runs out of ideas far too quickly, and apart from the finale of this sequel, I was bored out of my mind.102 Dalmatians is a film you watch while you're on an aeroplane or a ferry or something, not just for your regular entertainment.I rate 102 Dalmatians 5 out of 10.

The plot is about Cruella De Vil (Glenn Close) who  is after the puppy coat the she was deprived of in 1996. She hires Jean-Pierre Le Pelt (Gérard Depardieu) to make her coat. She has her butler, Alonso (Tim McInnerny), kidnap the puppies. The owner of Dipstick (one of the puppies from 101) is Chloe Simon (Alice Evans), a dog lover who is upset about the release Cruella from prison. Cruella claims to be cured but when Big Ben goes off, she goes back to normal. Also in the plot, Kevin Sheperd (Ioan Gruffudd) owns a place called 2nd Chance where he takes in stray dogs. One of the dogs is actually a bird (voiced by Eric Idle) who thinks he's a dog. And of course, a romance starts between Chloe and Kevin.102 was critically bashed. But it's harmless. I know, it's not a great film. It's barely even good. But think about how a child would feel about it. The movie is aimed at children, that's why it's hard to review movies like this. It's a cute little family film. Aimed at families that have small children. You can take your child to this movie without having to worry about sex, violence, or language. The only violence in it is slap stick, which is completely harmless. So if you go to the movie expecting it to be good you will be very disappointed. But if you go to this movie with an open mind and just want to see a good natured movie, I think you'll have fun.

This sequel is a pointless one and is too much of the same. Still the movie is fun enough to watch, especially for children.Thank goodness that Glenn Close is still in this one. Without her the movie would had been terrible. She really plays her villainous role perfectly over-the-top, in an enjoyable way. Gérard Depardieu supports her as another villain. He also is fun and over-the-top but his character doesn't feel completely necessary for the story. It was like his character was written for the story in case Glenn Close would say no to this sequel. Another returning actor is Tim McInnerny as the butler Alonzo. He already was perfectly cast and fun in the first movie and he gets luckily more to do in this movie. Main characters in this movie are played by Ioan Gruffudd and Alice Evans. Not the two most interesting actors if you asked me.The story is perfectly simple, like a children's movie should be. It's filled with some humorous moments but it misses some of the slapstick and subtle comedy the first movie had.Another thing that's missing is the Michael Kamen musical score. David Newman, who scored for this movie, is by no means a bad composer of course but Kamen his score had a more fun feeling that did good to the movie its atmosphere.The movie yet again has some good looking costumes and this time they even got nominated for an Oscar for this.The movie might be a bit too simple and too much like the first movie to be regarded as terribly original or good. Still this movie is perfectly fun to watch but by no means a must see, not even if you already have seen the first movie.5/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"jaw-dropping dud","Date":"29 May 2001","Score":"3 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family","Review":"  Remember the name Kevin Lime - and please, please never lethim direct again.

After seeing it, my wife and I both agreed that the studio simply churned this out and could have cared less if it was entertaining. This is a good example of a concept only film--they have a concept about a film and the other details are unimportant because execs KNOW it will make $$ just based on the initial concept.The movie starts with Cruella getting out of prison and going on parole. She no longer hates puppies but has been programmed to adore them--she simply couldn't hurt a flea. This doesn't last too long after her release and she's back to her old ways. Period.The most annoying aspects of the movie were the supporting characters. Eric Idle as the voice of Waddlesworth the bird made me HATE him--and that is TOUGH considering I am a die-hard Python fan. It was obvious he did this because they gave him lots of money (there can't be any other reason). Cruella's low self-esteem servant, Tim McInnerny, was funny in the Black Adder shows but here he is totally wasted and unfunny. And it must have cost a few bucks to get Gérard Depardieu but he was utterly wasted as well. There were some other supporting actors as well but given how poorly written the characters were, I am trying to block them out of my mind.Overall, you'd be better just to let your kids watch television or even play Grand Theft Auto than bother letting them see this drivel.
