Richard Le Gravenais the writer, director of this movie was the writer of The Ref and other movies I always keep kind of handy. I've played Living Out Loud after dinner for friends who had never seen it. I've done it three times and, each time, it was a hit with the gals and gay guys the others made fun of the movie and were subsequently thrown out of the room. Interesting, at least for me, to think that this movie has made me question myself. I wish it happened more often at the movies.

What seems to some a disjointed story with no plot seems to me to be the reality of life.  People can't really see the connectedness of the events of their lives while they experience them.  This film had that reality.  The characters all experienced loneliness, loneliness had no connection to status or any other social differences.  They are all trying to connect and ultimately they need to connect with themselves and their dreams.  On first viewing I was perplexed by the dance scene.   Now I see it as the main character finding and accepting herself. It was a refreshing awakening. It was good to be reminded that to get a life one needs to continue to experience life. A film for all those who hurt or celebrate relationships and want to get a life.

Holly Hunter plays Judith, a feisty and freshly divorced woman in her early forties with an overactive imagination. Danny DeVito plays Pat, a depressed and proud elevator attendant with emotional baggage all his own. After they share words a friendship gingerly begins to form. The creative casting of the fabulous Holly Hunter and the frequently under-appreciated dramatic talents of Danny DeVito is only the beginning of the special qualities of Living Out Loud. This is a mature study of adult relationships, especially of those that have tried, failed, and are left emotionally crippled. It's an intimate, quiet film about regular people made with so many genuine moments and with such winning results that one can only be reminded how infrequently a film like this comes along. It might not be that clever comedy the DVD suggests, but in a way the false advertising makes it that much more of a find.

There is an honesty and intensity that is disarming and moving. Though the resolution is a bit Hollywood, the process is real and really funny. Holly Hunter is a fearless actress who plays a dumped wife; not too mousy or too terrific. We hear the inner dialog so many take drugs to drown out. Coincidentally it has one of the best drug perspective scenes ever. She almost makes me want to drink again.Danny Devito plays the love interest; yes this movie has guts! Though, thank God, the sex scene is not with him. Danny plays a born loser realizing he doesn't have to be. Finally Queen Latifah (spelling?) is flawless as a bluesy torch singer! If you had told me I'd hear ANYONE sing an Ella Fitzgerald standard that was worthy, I would have called you crazy. She's got everything, including a voice and a presence on film I genuinely enjoy.See this movie, even if your just a little neurotic and searching to laugh out loud at the ugly truth.

It came out in 1998 with a confused ad campaign and disappeared very quickly.  It's a real shame because it was one of the best films on 1998.  All the acting is excellent, there are some great songs mostly sung by Queen Latifah and there's a very exciting sequence between Hunter and a masseur (played by a very handsome, muscular actor named Eddie Cibrian).  There's no real strong storyline--it's basically about how Hunter tries various ways to get on with her life after her divorce.  The film jumps from fantasy to reality seamlessly, has sharp dialogue and realistic situations.  It's never dull--there are countless great moments (the sequence with Cibrian; her encounter behind a door in a club; the dancing sequence at a lesbian bar; all of Queen Latifah's singing) and has an uplifting, unexpected ending.  A great movie all the way around. If you haven't seen it, do so.  You won't be disappointed.

Mr. LaGravenese has made a triumphant transition from screenwriter to director. Holly Hunter is brilliant in the role of Judith, one of the most emotionally complex woman that I've seen on the screen in ages. Hunter is a bundle of pent-up sexuality and rage that explodes as her safe upperclass NYC life begins to unravel. Danny Devito is a good actor who when given the right script becomes a great actor. He is perfect as the unlucky recently divorced elevator operator trying to catch a break. Queen Latifah is awesome. Her talent is natural and honest. She is the most interesting black female in film today(second only to Alfre Woodard or Angela Bassett). Martin Donovan is cinema's best kept secret. His talent is also very natural as can be seen in his other work(Insomnia, The Oppsite of Sex, etc). If you are looking for a film about 'self-discovery', this is the film for you.

The fact that the vastly thick movie-going public didn't embrace this film is just a mere testament to how great it was. (I guess they all loved Armaggedon!) The complaint about a weak storyline is completely unfounded. Who hasn't had obstacles to overcome in life and love and yes, divorce is a huge obstacle! Writer/director Richard LaGravenese understood this and actually fashioned his film out of real life, not fabrication. His character Judith (Holly Hunter) is a real flesh-and-blood woman going through the painful trial of divorce from an insensitive, callous jerk and struggles with loneliness and sorrow. She is also a woman of wants and desires and a certain unfortunate taste in bad men and also prone to fantasy. Who doesn't know anyone like that? Enter Pat (superbly played by Danny DeVito), an elevator man in an upscale building who is largely ignored and mistreated by the snobs in that building, until Judith (who also lives there) takes the time to get to know him. He has marital problems and gambling problems. Who doesn't? Then there's Liz, (the sultry Queen Latifah) the nightclub jazz singer who puts up a front on stage and off, until she learns to be a little more human to her fan base. Talented people are often misunderstood or lopped in with the nasty snobs. Who hasn't had a similar negative encounter with a person you admire? ****SPOILER ALERT**** One of the biggest and trickiest risks that LaGravenese took was not to make Hunter and DeVito's characters obvious targets for romance and that they didn't fall in love with each other. I'm actually glad that he took a strong realistic approach to the material as opposed to the glossed-over Hollywood treatment. These were real people in real situations, not cardboard cutouts in search of a plot.All in all, LaGravenese (who's work such as THE FISHER KING, THE REF and A LITTLE PRINCESS I've admired) tells his story with plenty of humor, sadness, wit, anger, sass, and plenty of music. Latifah's powerful voice was a sign of things to come for this talented artist. Though she didn't receive a nomination for this film, it's clear she was noticed. In fact, all involved moved on to bigger and better things since, so no sense crying about it.I like the fact that it's in my DVD collection to enjoy over and over again. Hopefully you will too.

In his own directorial debut, LaGravenese again shows dexterity with unexpected character development in this self-penned 1998 dramedy. On the surface, the plot is straightforward. Judith, a wealthy, middle-aged Manhattan woman, is reeling from a divorce from her smug doctor husband for whom she gave up her own promising medical career to become a nurse. Pat, the doorman in her building, is also suffering from a bad marriage, has increasing gambling debts, and just lost his daughter. After months of indifference, they finally speak to each other, and he becomes smitten even though she only wants to be friends. Providing sharp, unpredictable dialogue, LaGravenese does not rely on clichés to formulate the characters, and it's the quirky sense of revelation he provides to Judith and Pat that keeps the story consistently engaging. He also effectively inserts fantasy scenes to reflect Judith's wavering state of mind - a technique I haven't seen used as well since Irvin Kershner's Up the Sandbox a quarter century earlier.Casting helps considerably as Holly Hunter and Danny DeVito play Judith and Pat with consummate skill and poignancy. Looking taut, often apoplectic and sometimes quite sexy, Hunter makes Judith a refreshingly multi-dimensional figure, a wounded bird one minute and a cutting harpy the next. I particularly like her curt response to her ex-husband's conciliatory new wife, as well as the effortlessly seductive dance moves she exhibits at a lesbian nightclub. In a surprising display of warmth, DeVito makes Pat a sympathetic character without resorting to either self-pity or smarminess. Vocalizing in a confident, languorous manner, Queen Latifah gives a nicely assured performance as Liz, a nightclub jazz singer with whom Judith bonds. The 1999 DVD includes a thoughtful commentary track from LaGravenese, a strong extra in itself, though it seems a shame in hindsight that they were not able to secure the principal actors to participate. In addition to the original theatrical trailer, there are also five deleted scenes including Queen Latifah's full performance of the standard Lush Life.

Holly Hunter is single and working at a hospital. Danny De Vito is divorced after twenty-five years of marriage. He owes a large debt in which his job as an elevator bellhop doesn't satisfy. His brother wishes to help him at his bar but De Vito holds out hoping to excel elsewhere. Recently his daughter passed away, which leads to his encounter with Hunter. She pays off his debt thus leading to interesting encounters yet an obvious conclusion. Directed by Richard LaGravenese who bypasses clichés with style, despite the predictable formula that drives the ending home. Hunter and De Vito flourish with humour in tact. Hunter is searching for something new and De Vito is hoping to bandage the old and move on. They have a unique chemistry despite the fact that the outcome is obvious. Supporting roles are played by an ambitious cast with little to do. Queen Latifah plays a nightclub singer who strikes up a friendship with Hunter but despite the energy put into the performance, the role is more or less a prop added when the leads are separated. Martin Donovan plays Hunter's ex in what is typical and predictable as he tries to reenter her life. Entertaining and provocative comedy.

Judith quit her medical studies when she married, and lived an upper class life, dropping all of her friends because they couldn't afford to do things with her. All she had was her husband's friends, and they've deserted her now. She lives alone in a huge Fifth Avenue apartment and attempts to cope with the loneliness while she tries to find her identity. Her support system includes the elevator man, Pat (DeVito), who falls for her, and a club named Jasper's, where Liz Bailey (Queen Latifah) sings.Judith's fantasies transition smoothly to the real situation. Some of her fantasies are hilarious. The best scene in the film, in my opinion, is the scene where Judith and Liz go to a lesbian bar and Judith leads an amazing dance. Her confession scene to Pat is excellent as well, as is the scene where she meets her husband to close a real estate deal. And the massage scene - very sexy. Hunter is fabulous as woman who is stronger than she knows but also has a real vulnerability.Danny DeVito is sympathetic and lovable as Pat, a man who also is seeking an identity. He doesn't want to be a bartender in his brother's (Richard Schiff) bar, he doesn't want to take money from his brother, and he doesn't want to stay an elevator man. He has a business idea. He and Judith talk about their dreams and find true friendship with one another.This is a marvelous film, warm, sexy, and fun, with a terrific soundtrack, beautifully written and directed by Richard LaGravenese.

Richard LaGravenese is more interested in showing how people bounce off each other, in friendships and sexual relationships, than forcing a made-up romance between two people.  Holly Hunter stars as Judith, a woman who's coming off a bitter breakup from her husband (Martin Donovan) of sixteen years.  She meets Danny Devito, and elevator attendant in her apartment.  She also meets a torch singer (Queen Latifah), and they both change her life, but in different ways.  LaGravenese doesn't find it necessary to place Hunter in a sexual relationship with either one, and that makes the film all the more unique.  Now, because there is no plot per-se, the film may flounder for some.  However, I found the movie to be very remarkable.  Danny Devito gives a detailed performance as a man who's lost everything, but still has hope.  The first scene we see him in is very well acted, and absolutely hilarious.  However, it's the two females who shine brightest in this film.  Hunter is stunningly sensual in her role, embodying grace (sometimes it's lack), desperation, and humour.  Her performance deserved an oscar nomination.  The surprising scene stealer was Queen Latifah.  Her rendition of 'Lush Life' was great to watch.  She certainly holds her own against two incredible actors.  Some of the scenes deserve mention as well.  The dancing sequence was very well done.  The line between fantasy and reality was blurred, but frankly, I don't want to know if it was real or part of her imagination.  It was very sensual, and again, oddly touching.

This is honestly one of the best movies I have ever seen.  I absolutely fell in love with it. Our main character, Judith Nelson, played phenomenally by Holly Hunter, will steal your heart.  Danny Devito delivers a wonderful and poignant performance.  And the surprise of the movie for me was Queen Latifah. With a voice that could melt butter and a completely heartfelt performance she did more than hold her own with veteran pros Devito and Hunter, she stole a scene or two from them.  It follows Judith through a messy divorce which leaves her lonely and most pitiful, but then things start to turn around. She meets Devito (the doorman in her upscale New York penthouse) and they become friends.  Queen Latifah is a lounge singer in a club Judith begins to frequent.  The story takes off from there.  It covers the range of emotions and experiences which are all a part of divorce, healing, and, eventually, triumph.  It rings with truth, even though some of it may seem less than believable.  It is not for art to reflect life perfectly but to represent it accurately, and this movie does that...  not to mention providing all of us (men too) who are victims of divorce with a glimmer of hope for life afterwards.  I recommend it most highly.

His beautiful and beloved daughter died, and his successful wife kicked him out because he is one of life's lovable losers, and she wants to be with a winner. He's sweet-tempered and a good guy, but always in over his head with borrowing from tough guys or with ideas too big for his abilities. He's working as an elevator operator.Holly Hunter is a rich divorcee whose slimy cardiologist husband has deserted her for a younger model. She lives in the building where DeVito runs the elevator.They are driven together by common loneliness and one shared interest, a love for the music of a terrific local club singer who never quite hit the big time (Queen Latifah).The movie's first great strength is that it deals with them in a honest way. They interact as the characters really would in life.The second great strength is the power of their performances, especially DeVito, who is wounded and charming and completely real. You know a dozen guys like him. Also worthy of praise is Latifah, who is a completely natural actress and, man, can she sing!I guess there are a couple flaws as well. I never could have any sympathy for the Hunter character. She is completely self-centered, and after her husband left, she's left with nothing but her great looks, her brainpower (she'll go back to medical school), zillions of dollars, and her Park Avenue apartment. Oh, you poor, poor, dear!And the story mixes reality with her own interior fantasy monologue, and it is not easy to tell which is which.  I guess she couldn't have really done that dance routine, because even a professional Broadway chorine couldn't pick up that choreography instantly.  But what about the stranger who pulls her in the room and starts kissing her? I guess this one really happened, because she talks about it later. When she reverses the action later, with DeVito, I guess it did NOT happen, based upon other incidents in the movie. All in all, I'm not sure what did and didn't happen. Did she really go to that meeting and throw oranges at her husband, or was it another fantasy?The final weakness was the ex-husband, who was a cartoon character in an otherwise honest movie. Thankfully, he wasn't wearing a Snidely Whiplash costume or doing any pirate laughs. I guess this could be justified within the context of the movie because he is seen from her P.O.V., and at this stage in her life she's not ready to stand back objectively and concede him any depth.Oh, well, I guess it doesn't matter that much. If you let it flow over you, it's a darned good movie. Warning to guys - it's a chick flick.

The relationship between the two leads works well, although I wish the script did more than merely hint at the question of class.  The greatest weaknesses are Queen Latifah's promising but undeveloped character (barely more than a prop for Hunter's Judith to lean on) and an ending which grants Hunter and DeVito the happiness they've been seeking, in a tidy little package.  Despite these flaws, Living Out Loud is the sort of film Hollywood needs to create more often.

Judith (Holly Hunter) is trying to recover from a divorce.  Pat (Danny de Vito) is also recovering from hard blows.  He is the elevator operator in her building, she's a nurse who dreams of finishing medical school.And Judith's dreams are the core of the story.  She imagines events, and we see them staged as she would see them.  Sometimes things happen that we wonder is it real or imagined.  With her new friend Liz (Queen Latifah), Judith visits an after-hours club populated entirely by women.  Liz warns Judith that the dance floor may be more than she can handle.  Next thing we know, Judith has not only ventured onto the dance floor but is leading the other dancers in a number which in and of itself will make this worth buying when it comes out on video.  It's not Rockettes choreography it's a dance about loving music and the freedom of movement, and Hunter is a joy to behold as she dances.Is this just a product of Judith's overactive imagination?  What about her brief encounter with a man at a club?  Whatever.  One way or another, these things help to empower her to make the changes she desires in her life, and that's all that matters.Pat also needs to make changes in his life.  He's in debt from gambling and hates to ask his brother for more money.  He and Judith grow in a bond of friendship that is touching and warm.  He has a dream of starting an import business, but has let it be nothing but a dream for a long time.This is a great, great movie that I'd see again in a heartbeat.  The cast is excellent.  I already knew that Queen Latifah could act, and that she has been a success in the music business.  What a pleasant surprise to find out that she can sing quality material like Lush Life as if she had been singing jazz and blues all her life.Danny de Vito is wonderful, as always.  When we first see him he's walking along and sees a woman crying.  He tries to help her, offers her his handkerchief, and her husband or boyfriend comes along and shouts angrily at de Vito, angrily thinking that de Vito is the woman's new squeeze.I've been a fan of Holly Hunter's for many years.  I first noticed her in a horror movie called THE BURNING, and then BROADCAST NEWS solidified her position.  She's always a welcome sight.None of these characters are perfect.  All are fully developed and very, very human.  I could believe them.  These were people I would like to come to my home to visit the family.  And how many movies can you say that about?And, might I add that there is neither an asteroid nor a comet in sight. Nothing blows up.  Thank the Lord!Parents' note  This is an R and that should be observed.  There's the usual language (which could easily have been done without) and a scene in which Judith has an erotic massage, but actually I was more upset by her smoking. And her a nurse, too!On a five scale, Pops gives LIVING OUT LOUD five very warm hugs.

Holly Hunter is a bit strong willed, maybe too dynamic for the mousy Judith. Danny DeVito is not a guy we want to see battling his romantic side. Martin Donovan we hardly can believe as a legitimate part of society, a cardiologist no less. And  Queen Latifah is about 25 years too young to play Ella Fitzgerald.Without stable, understandable casting choices, the viewer has to work far too hard to understand the inner motivations of the main characters. The story translation suffers, the nuance, the payoff is severely diluted.I liked the film, but in different hands it might have been far better. Don't get me wrong, You have to walk before you can run, and I'll gladly give  M. LaGravenese another chance. I likely will not be disappointed.

It had that smarmy East Coast My life just isn't good enough even though I clearly don't deserve any better feel to it that seems to go with films and novels replete with cigarettes, alcohol, lounge singers and urban angst.I found myself feeling absolutely no sympathy for the petulant heroine, which was odd for a Holly Hunter fan. DeVito was magnificent, and in the end I felt his song may have been worth the price of admission.See this film if you like to feel sorry for yourself and wish the world would treat you better.

Either all or nothing would have been better.  Having a few at the beginning and one near the end made no sense.  Throughout middle of film, we were never sure if the scenes were real or the start of a fantasy, so it was difficult to have sympathy for the characters.

I was parked in my 1979 Oldsmobile Delta 88 Royale and Louise Devery in her 1981 Chevy Citation was double parked next to me. I looked over to her and watched her put on her makeup. When she looked at me I smiled. When I got out of my car I noticed her directional was not working. Well guess what, I'm still fixing her car after all these years. Coincidentally we were later paired up as a couple in the final scene. I just wanted to mention that we are now getting married 11 years later on December 8th, 2007. I thought it would be appropriate to post this comment to mention how important Living Out Loud was to me. Not only is it a great film and has a wonderful cast, I met the Love Of My Life, on the set. I just wanted the world to know. All the best from Edward Rollin and Louise Devery!

Every performance, every line of dialogue, every note of a tremendous musical score ranks perfection. Holly Hunter, who is always excellent, excels in this difficult role. A film that can even make me like Danny Devito has to be super. This movie was not seen by a large audience as it has such deep dramatic undertones which don't appeal to mass audiences, but I was in awe of the entire production. Queen Latifah shows another side to her talent with a tremendously jazz vocal offering. The few scenes of Eddie Cibrian (Third Watch) make him a superb candidate for People Magazine's 'Sexiest Man Alive'. Only if you're a lover of good drama and serious moviegoing can you appreciate the magnitude of this movie. I can't praise it enough!

And, that Danny deVito plays, well, Danny deVito.  Same guy that sold Aluminum siding. But Holly Hunter is absolutely right on.  Every nuance of body language, facial expression, line inflection, everything, just about perfect.  If you love good acting--playing the part of a warm but imperfect human being (albeit unlikely one)---this is Holly at her best.

This plodding, plaintive, well acted flick with warmth and charm is, judging from IMDB's demographic stats, a sort of middle aged female chick flick. A worthy effort with excellent performances and some good jazz singin' by Latifah.

I loved Holly in Broadcast News, and Danny has shown himself to be more than capable in numerous other dramatic roles (such as The Big Kahuna), but this one left me cold.  There are some movies that leave you sympathetic with characters who wonder what might have been, and others (like this one) where you just want to shake them and say get over it.  Heck, I even liked An Affair to Remember and The Bridges of Madison County, but this one was simply too much (or too little) for me.

Consequently I don't even know how it ends because I was thinking about something else.  I like movies about relationships and Holly Hunter seemed like a real person, but it just didn't work for me as well as I would have liked.  The best scene was Holly in the lawyers office with her ex-husband - I laughed like hell during that! She has a nice moment in the alley with The Kisser, but I figured Hunter and Koteas were just happy to not have to duplicate their scenes with others in Crash.

Unfortunately, it wasn't even mildly good. The movie showed a collection of moments in the lives of Holly Hunter's and Danny DeVito's characters, but with little direction or conclusion. It seemed to start and end in the middle, with a lot of noise in between. Not to give anything away, but some of the plot line was not only impossible (such as her dancing partner at the lesbian club), but it just didn't make sense.

She works part-time as a nurse (she only seems to have one patient), but she has no children to look after, she lives in a posh east-side condo, gets an erotic massage by a gorgeous hunk (someone asks her how much this costs but she doesn't say), has exhilaratingly romantic encounters with strange men in alleys, and develops warm friendships with her elevator operator and a tough but kindhearted jazz singer who takes her to an all-girl club for all-night dancing.  We're probably meant to feel sorry for her because her life is empty, but it's hard to be sympathetic to Hunter's problems when she spends half her time behaving like a child (throwing food at her husband during a session at her lawyer's) and the other half indulging herself in La Dolce Vita New York-style.  A lot of the audience is probably asking so what's her problem?  Writer-director Richard LaGravenese plays some of this for obvious fantasy but, unfortunately, the whole movie seems like a fairy tale, despite committed performances by Hunter, Danny DeVito and Queen Latifah. To paraphrase Dorothy Parker, if you get to choose between being rich and lonely in Manhattan, or being poor, rich is better.

From the trailers I was expecting a completely different film. I anticipated a much more ebullient experience, where Latifah plays the strong female friend who helps bolster her buddy's confidence after the break up and together they go out and grab life by the XXXX's. That wasn't it.Seeing it from the eyes of the viewers comments' has allowed me to appreciate what they took from this film, but nonetheless, I was left disappointed.

Unfortunately, the relationships aren't explored deeply.  And we never get to know the Queen Latifah character at all.The movie ends rather abruptly after little development. I guess there's nothing wrong at aiming for an ending that has the messy feel of real life.  The problem is that the director wants it both ways and throws in unrealistic scenes like the massage for no other reason than to crank up the sex content.  And there's a really bizarre fantasy sequence that doesn't fit the movie's tone at all.I can't quite recommend LOL, but will add that my wife liked it more than me.  Maybe women in general can better sympathize with the female lead and her search for personal  fulfillment.  I wanted to see more of the relationships.

While the actors are quite good the plot is pointless. The movie seems to be standing still for the most part with no development of any kind, and while it may have a good concept it is very poorly writen or confered to the viewers. When I saw this movie in a theater half the people in the theater left before the movie was over. Although I stayed till the end I urge anyone with good common sense, who appreciates good movies do NOT go see this one. "}]
