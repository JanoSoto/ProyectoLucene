It takes a hard and frank look at the motivation behind several different relationships, which varies from selfishness, loneliness and boredom to love of the deepest kind.  The film makes you wonder how and why we choose our friends.Personally, I found the acting and direction superb, apart from a couple of flat speeches by Kate Beckinsale (whose accent also varied quite a bit).  Unfortunately one of these comes in the scene where her character is introduced, which may have put some people off this film at an early stage (there are a lot of negative comments on here!).    The rest of the cast are superb, especially Uma Thurman who is mastering the art of conveying a lot of meaning with just a single look.  Tension builds up throughout and is skillfully maintained right until the end.It is, of course, a film that you need to see on a big screen as part of the point of a Merchant Ivory production is the exquisite detail that goes into getting the costumes and locations just right.  Even more so than in their past productions, a huge amount of effort has been spent here.One thing I found is that the characters felt fairly isolated most of the time, you just saw the leading characters in a scene on their own and, apart from a couple of party scenes, there was not much attempt to show the society in which they lived; also there were few exterior shots in the cities.  It may be that that was quite deliberate, to show that these incredibly wealthy people lived very insular lives.

Although he lusts after a poor but beautiful lady named Charlotte, he decides to marry her very rich friend instead. His new wife, Maggie, is a lovely, innocent human being, totally unspoiled by wealth. Maggie hopes to see her widowed father happily remarried and encourages his interest in Charlotte. It happens. Charlotte agrees to marry America's first billionaire, what a tough gig. But, why? Does she have any affection for Maggie's father? Or does she want to stay in close contact with Amerigo? It seems the latter, for Charlotte and the Prince go everywhere together, now that it is acceptable for two relatives to gad about. What is happening here? The book was written over 100 years ago but this story of human nature shows that very little changes under the sun. Northam and Thurman excel as the egocentric and evil humans who are so very lovely to look upon, it hurts. Beckinsale and Nolte likewise give nice turns as the folks who still have hearts beating in their breasts, despite their riches. As period pieces go, the costuming, the scenery, the staging, and the cinematography here are sumptuous. True, the pace is somewhat slow and the tale is intricate and subtle, requiring a repeat viewing, perhaps. However, Merchant and Ivory fans and non-fans will be rewarded by sitting through this timeless and tantalizing tale. If anyone wants to arrange for friends to share a movie evening together, the Bowl will have everyone talking.

Sadly, the people aren't sufficiently interesting or charismatic to support such scrutiny for 2.2 hours. Amidst the sumptuous splendor of grand costuming, locations, props, makeup, etc. with some heavyweights behind the film, TGB is an earnest effort which comes off as much ado about nothing with the one steamy and passionate relationship underdone while the emphasis lingers on the minutia. Somewhat awkward and staged at times, the film doesn't rise to the level of it better period predecessors but will still be a worthwhile watch for those into films about wealth and aristocracy.

I haven't found yet the line in the novel by Thurman But the miners would prefer the train to a museum when Nolte describes to her how he will buy both sides of the street and the train tracks between in order to build his museum. The reason the language sounds stilted is that much of the dialogue was lifted verbatim from the novel.....what little dialogue there is.  And of course, the fascinating 'beasts unleashed' flavor of the sexual intercourse scene is NEVER to be found even alluded to in the novel.By the way, Edward II is buried in Gloucester Cathedral.  That question comes up, but is NEVER answered in the movie, and you THINK it is going to be the little point that breaks up their alibi We went to Gloucester Abbey, where there is some king buried, Edward II or Richard II.  The acting is superb, the scenery gorgeous and the psychological incest between Nolte and his daughter is discreetly and appropriately exemplified.  As HJ says, talking together in the castle gardens, they did indeed resemble husband and wife.  The adultery of the other two was almost foreordained. The social habits of this age when women had no independent means of making a living is underlined.  See this in conjunction with House of Mirth and you'll thank your lucky stars you live in 2001.  As much sexism as still exists in the workplace, we have indeed come a LONG way, Baby!!!!  Thurman's sense of imprisonment is palpable, and I wonder how many women went stark raving mad over their dependency, a form of slavery all the more odious for it not being recognized.  I wonder if ALice James had any part in the writing of this novel.  After reading this, she must have felt much better about her 'plight'.  Although I wish for the maiden ladies of that day, that they might have been able to adopt or have babies without the social stigmas of the time......a great joy in life that shouldn't be linked with the social tyranny of 'catching a man'.Return to a time when people used their minds for things other than writing better software, as their country and Constitution are taken over by greedy ignorant barbarians intent on destroying the planet.

I have seen too many of James Ivory's films to feel that this was accidental. But I didn't really see the resemblance until Jarvis came to deliver the bowl. (His shop was rather dark, and he may not have been wearing his cut-away coat at work.) I also thought it interesting how at least twice Jarvis put his hands out to catch the bowl should someone drop it, thus calling our attention to its fragility. (This was crystal, not glass, and who knows whether it will break when dropped?)The movie was over-long, of course. But it was a feast! There were many scenes that could have been edited down or eliminated, but the luxury of seeing the extra footage was wonderful. It reminded me of another favorite, wonderful(and long) movie, Mike Leigh's *Topsy-Turvey* (about the partnership of Gilbert and Sullivan).And interestingly, there's the same continuity/accent problem in both. In *The Golden Bowl* Angelica Houston plays some scenes with a distinct American Southern accent and some without. In *Topsy Turvy*, Sullivan's lover is quite British in one scene, chatting on about young Winston, yet at a piano recital she speaks in an American Southern accent. Wouldn't you think someone would have noticed in both instances and just re-looped the audio?Finally, the only reason I knew that Jarvis resembled Henry James is a book that my wife and I wrote for Harcourt. It's called *About the Author* and contains juicy-bits profiles of 125 favorite (living, dead, male, female, etc.) novelists. To put it another way, we assume that the reader has access to most of the boilerplate info on each author (Web searches, encyclopedia articles, textbooks, etc.). So we focus on the stuff you won't find in most of those sources.As part of our research, we learned that James's novels were often inspired by conversations and stories he heard at the many dinner parties he attended in London. (Between 1878 and 1879, he dined out 140 times.) Shades of Truman Capote?Although born in New York City in 1843, he became a British citizen in 1915. Henry James also attended Harvard Law School between 1862 and 1863. His father was a friend of Thoreau, Emerson, and Hawthorne. He himself, at age 26, arrived in London and soon met Darwin, George Eliot, Ruskin, Rossetti, William Morris, and others.He felt that criticism was intellectually superior to creative writing and considered himself primarily a critic. At the time of his death in 1916 at age 72, his novels were all but unread. Only after the observance of his 100th birthday in 1943, when World War II had focused America's attention on Europe, did critics realize that he was one of the greatest novelists of the 19th century.

The first one was The Remains of the Day, the second one this The Golden Bowl. Much to my surprise I must say that I liked both, although there was a big difference in the two. While the first one was very compelling and sometimes close to perfection, I didn't always have that feeling with this movie.In the early 1900's Adam Verver, an American billionaire, lives with his daughter in London. When she is introduced to the Italian Prince Amerigo, it doesn't take long before they get married. But the prince has a secret. He has a relationship with Charlotte Stant, Maggie Verver's best friend. Because Maggie doesn't know that Amerigo and Charlotte know each other, she sees no harm in introducing her to her widowed father and therefor allowing her to become a member of the family once she marries him. Charlotte is very happy with this match of course, because all she wants is to be close to Prince Amerigo. All this leads to one big masquerade full of deception, lies and unhappiness which can't be revealed...Despite the fact that I'm normally not a fan of this kind of movies, I must say that this one was OK. Especially the acting made it all worth watching. Thanks to the famous, but also well-acting cast which includes people like Kate Beckinsale, Anjelica Huston, Nick Nolte and Uma Thurman, I was able to enjoy this movie. Does that mean that it is a perfect movie? No, not exactly. The story for instances sometimes lacks a bit in power, making it not always very interesting to keep watching this movie for more than two hours. But on the other hand I must also say that it all could have been a lot worse. The story was perhaps not exceptional, but it sure was decent enough.In the end I don't think this is a movie that will appeal to the average fan of period movies. First of all is the time period not exactly correct. I believe that those movies situated in the early 19th century are a lot more popular than one which is situated in the early 1900's. But since I'm not such an average fan and because I've always been interested in the time period 1900 - 1950, this was quite interesting for me. It's only too bad that the story wasn't a bit more exceptional. Now I give this movie a rating in between 7/10 and 7.5/10, mostly because of the fine performances.

This way, perhaps, her reduced means would go further in the Europe of the last part of the XIX century. In Florence, she meets, and falls in love, with an impoverished Italian prince. They become lovers, but neither one has the money to live well in the society both loved. When Charlotte goes to London, her good friend Fanny Assingham, an American with a lot of social connections, has a plan to marry her to Adam Verver, the first American billionaire, whose own daughter, Maggie, happened to be Charlotte's friend.Amerigo had followed Charlotte to England, but he was seeing Maggie, a possible meal ticket, a way out for his money problems. One day, Charlotte and Amerigo visited an antique shop where they found a gorgeous vase decorated with gold. The owner tells them it is a perfect piece. The price though, kept it out of her budget, besides, she was not completely sure Maggie would like it. Amerigo's marriage to Maggie is a match made in heaven for Adam, who now can add a noble title to his future grandchildren.Maggie and Amerigo divided their time between the house in London and her father's splendid palace he rents in Leicestershire. Charlotte, now married to the older Adam, had not stopped loving Amerigo. Their passion is stronger, if anything. One week-end Charlotte and Amerigo go to a country estate where a celebration is happening. When they are to return to London, they decide to stay overnight at Gloucester, where they spend the night at an out of the way inn. Maggie is worried, but when they reappear, Amerigo explains how they wanted to see the magnificent cathedral. In doing so, he mentions something he has not the correct answer. Who is buried at the cathedral? Was it Richard II, or Edward II? Maggie, who obviously knows the answer is upset.Maggie, shopping at the antique shop is offered the golden bowl. The owner explains she can have it for less since he discovered a flaw in the crystal. When the merchant goes to deliver the piece, he notices the picture of Amerigo and Charlotte on a table. He mentions to Maggie this was the couple interested in buying the precious vase a few years ago. Maggie realizes the deception. Adam, noticing his daughter's distress, decides it is time for him to go back to America where he is building a museum to house all his European treasures. Charlotte, reluctantly, is made to go. In spite of her distaste for her native country, Charlotte will become a bigger socialite because of Adam's money, but in the process, she loses Amerigo.If there was anyone meant to bring Henry James' novel to the screen, it was James Ivory, a man that had made excellent adaptations of mostly English classic authors. The adaptation was entrusted to Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, an usual collaborator, who had done well transferring the original works into cinematic terms. Unfortunately, this venture did not pay off the same way that most of the other efforts did. Part of the blame must go into the casting of the four principal roles, and the almost static staging of the novel. Henry James' work presents some difficulty for the transfer to the screen.Uma Thurman is a ravishing creature. Her Charlotte is not exactly what one would have thought it could be. Complicating matters, there is no chemistry between her and Amerigo. Jeremy Northam's accent is not convincing for a noble Italian prince. Nick Nolte, who had worked with Mr. Ivory before, has a minor role. Kate Beckingsale, as Maggie is also not at her best. The only one that seems at ease is Anjelica Huston, whose Fanny is the best thing in the picture, but she is only a minor character.The film is gorgeously photographed in authentic settings. Tony Pierce-Roberts' camera captures those great places in all its splendor. The musical score is by Richard Robbins.

As mentioned by many, the formal stilted dialog was really really tough to enjoy and since I didn't know a whole lot about the plot(haven't read the book) much of the movie made no sense. This is a very hard movie to follow and I was also put off by the lack of emotion in the performances. At times it seemed like the performers were just reading dialog and I really did almost turn it off.But the thing is, the second half of the movie is really interesting. It's like the movie and performers come into their own and all of a sudden, I got sucked into the whole story. By the time the end rolled around I was riveted. And the performers went from stiff and stilted to really really moving.So I asked myself what in the world do I rate a movie like this? It really is a tough movie to decide if I liked or not when the first half was absolutely awful and the second half was not just good, but riveting. So finally I gave it a 7. It's really interesting in that I started off thinking all the performers were miscast and ended thinking they were all really good. This really is a movie that takes it's time in sucking you in.I do wish it had been a little easier to follow( movie seems to assume that it's audience is familiar with the book) and some of the stilted dialog had been dropped. I understand that the period it was taking place in contributes to the dialog but it did make it very hard to become involved in the story and as mentioned, the performers came off initially as stiff and just not very comfortable, though that changed greatly as the story went on.Beckinsale and Nolte were, in my opinion, the best and all the characters stay with you after. Uma Thurman, while originally seeming the most miscast, winds up delivering with one of the most powerful scenes in the film at the end and that one scene alone makes her character extremely memorable.The landscapes were also very lovely and the story, in spite of the difficulty in following it, was compelling and the movie really does linger with you in a way that one might not expect, particularly during the first half. In my opinion, the ending was also way to rushed but since I haven't read the book I have no idea if the movie was just following the book. I'd see this again and will recommend it to fellow moviegoers I know. At the same time, if someone loses patience with the story and turns it off midstream I can understand that too because a lot of patience is needed in the beginning.

Jeremy Northam is totally unbelievable as an Italian Prince. Chico Marx had a better accent. He creates not an iota of romantic tension or Mediterranean warmth, and they've made him look like Mandy Patinkin!!! Roberto Bengnini would have at least been more interesting! Kate Beckinsale is as vacuous as Thurman and annoyingly bland throughout the movie.  And when are the Merchant Ivory people going to realize that Nick Nolte doesn't work in a period costume epic. Listening to him do the lines was liking listening to a high school play. Ughhhh!The one plus for this movie is the art direction.  It's stunning.

The sets and costumes look quite authentic. Through subtle references one can see how James Ivory has been influenced by classic movies. The story is about complex relationships, between a father and his daughter, between two former lovers and between husbands and wives. The characters are very well etched and layered and it is the mystery of these characters that has intrigued me the most. How long has Verver known about Amerigo and Charlotte's relationship? Since when has Maggie known? Did Charlotte have any feelings at all for Verver? The film does move at a slightly tedious pace but it picks up when Maggie starts suspecting the relationship between Charlotte and Amerigo. Northam's Amerigo takes some getting used to. I found him funny initially but once one is passed that he's quite good and terrific in the scenes where he's restrained. Uma Thurman sizzles. Charlotte may come across as a temptress at times but Thurman portrays her vulnerability and despair with gusto. Kate Beckinsale is equally fantastic. Hats off to Nick Nolte for a studied and subtle performance of a father who has to make the ultimate sacrifice in order to save his daughter's marriage. Angelica Huston makes herself noticeable.

It's just one great touch among many.  When Jarvis offers the golden bowl to Charlotte and later sells it to Maggie, it's as if James himself, with infinite patience and compassion for his characters, has stepped directly into the story in order to impel it forward. (He bears something of a further likeness to that fellow past master of the mind game, Alfred Hitchcock; so it's reminiscent, in turn, of Hitchcock's own cameos.)  Too bad the article in question is irreparably flawed, but it does produce an unintentionally hilarious association with a line from another bit of risky business  There's a crack in my egg!You'll find this film boring if you find Henry James boring.  That can't be helped.  The question any modern viewer will be asking throughout, is  Why do all these people keep talking so delicately around an affair which is so obvious to the randy, piano-pounding Lady Castledean and Mr. Blint?  (Sheesh, at least *someone* in this movie gets it!)  Looks like an example of what I believe Larry Niven has termed literary cretinism.  Today, the whole thing would come out in the first five minutes in a nightmare of recrimination and violence (as Hugh Grant puts it in Four Weddings and a Funeral), and the rest of the time would be spent with Adam's and Charlotte's lawyers divvying up the proceeds.  What James' artificially mounted intrigue does, however, is to create the opportunity for some exquisite epistemological gropings-in-the-dark; count the number of times character A can be seen silently comparing the statements of characters B and C for inconsistencies.  For insights into the deftly depicted, pivotal event of the deliberate breakage of the bowl, refer to Terence Cave's footnote on page 433 of Recognitions.  He knows that she knows, and she knows that he knows that she knows ...I have to confess, though, that it was the atmospheric, sepia-tinted archival footage of coal trains in the early twentieth century that stayed with me most after the credits had rolled.

On the one hand I see this film for what it was... a period piece/drama.  Then again, its about the moments fore and aft of two peoples' frustrations over their spouses' lack of interest for them and what they do about it.  Therefore, one would think that there might be some sort of -what the French call a certain -I don't know what.  Whatever the plot to this story needed -- it wasn't there.Keep in mind, when I see a movie like this I've already decided that I need to be in the mood for lots of dialogue and scenery and deceptions.  However, this movies lacked intrigue.  One (at least I) already knew what was going to happen right near the beginning when we find thar person A finds out that person B is getting married and they've had a past relationship.  What we get is a disecting of something that need not be dissected.  Here's the fine line  1) It was kind of cool to see Nick Nolte in such a different role for him.  He proves once again that he's a very diverse actor.  2) All the performances were right on for projecting the emotions of their characters; and I mean all the performances... very well done.What worked  Like I said, the performances.  Beautifully done and quite an accurate portrayal.  In fact, I debated giving this film more points for the actors' work, alone.  However, good acting alone does not a great film make.What didn't work  The story had the skin of a plot and with that plot great potential that was untapped.  I think a story should have twists and turns and things happening out of the blue to keep the audience interested.  But nothing, in my opinion, happened out of the blue.  It was all quite straight-lined right to the end with no ups or downs or mystery.  Having said that, if you want to see a film on how people lived in the early 20th century; this movie should fulfill you.I'm reminded of the scene in 'The Sixth Sense' where Bruce Willis tells the story of the man who got in a car and drove and drove and drove and drove.  Then, he stopped and though he'd drive some more.  So, he drove on and drove...  You get the point.  Then, Cole speaks up and suggests that the doctor needs some twists and things to make the story interesting.5/10 - all five points go to the performances of every artist in the cast for doing the parts they were given.thank you "},{"Title":"Visually beautiful if uneven Merchant-Ivory production, but does laudably with perhaps Henry James' most demanding work","Date":"18 August 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" Merchant-Ivory have been responsible for some great films, The Remains of the Day is one of my favourites and A Room with a View, Howard's End and Maurice are also great. The Golden Bowl is one of their lesser efforts, it has some great things but is rather uneven and one of those films that will either captivate or alienate.The best thing about The Golden Bowl is the production values, which are impeccable, as can be expected from Merchant-Ivory. It is so beautifully shot, the settings are gorgeous and have such atmosphere and warmth and the costumes are very elegant. Apart from the somewhat irritating use of the comic song, the film is also very nicely scored with the right amount of vibrancy and sensitivity. The direction from James Ivory is appropriately restrained, the script in the second half is more witty, eloquently written and intriguing with some clever double entendres and the story in the second half is more compelling, suspenseful and poignant.In The Golden Bowl, the acting is mostly good with a few exceptions and a couple of reservations, with the good performances coming from Kate Beckinsale, Uma Thurman and Anjelica Huston. Beckinsale's performance here is one of her better ones, not only does she radiate on screen, but she's moving and dignified and her agony at realising how flawed her marriage is really hits home. Despite reservations of Thurman being too modern, and she does overact in the final scene with the most poignant line in the book and film being delivered a little too much in a hammy way, she is incandescently nuanced, heart-wrenching and wittily seductive. Huston is very cool and commanding, and definitely gives one of the most consistent and most at ease performances in the film.Nick Nolte is also mostly impressive, a little too mannered and too nice for my tastes sometimes but once the writing gets grittier and the story more compelling his toughness has a good amount of brooding intensity and his devotion is touchingly and subtly portrayed. Jeremy Northam for me was the weak link in the cast, he's devilishly handsome but also incredibly stiff complete with an accent that never sounds believable and takes one out of the film. James Fox has very little to do in an underwritten role, it is a role he should have been ideal for but it wastes him unfortunately.The Golden Bowl's script is uneven, with it being better in the second half than in the first. The dialogue at times in the first half is stilted and pretty awful, with a lack of emotional connection. In the film generally there is also material that adds little (including an out of place exotic dance), it loses much of the themes of doubt and ambiguity that makes the story as complex as it is and some of it is even over-simplified to the point that the impact is completely lost, like the talk of dishonour. Henry James is very difficult to adapt, and The Golden Bowl is perhaps his most demanding work because of the themes and how deeply he examines the mixed motives of the characters, but while the characters, relationships, basic events and the motivations are all there some of it felt like Henry James watered down. The story is too languidly paced in the first half due to the story not being as interesting, there is a disconnect emotionally and the characters don't intrigue enough at this point. There is also too much symbolism, and some of it is laid on too thickly, like with the golden bowl and the exterior darkness.All in all, visually beautiful and mostly well-acted but uneven. A lesser Merchant-Ivory effort, and not one of the strongest Henry James film adaptations (The Innocents, The Wings of the Dove and especially The Heiress), but worth seeing. 6/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"Much Ado About Nothing - Zzzzzz","Date":"28 January 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" Can I please have those two hours of my life back?This movie was really much ado about nothing. So they had an affair; a common occurrence among the rich aristocrats of the time. Yes, her being the friend of his wife made it worse but the father and daughter had their own affair going on. One might ask what kind but it seemed rather incestuous, even if only emotionally.I found the young wife so annoying. She's so one dimensional; like her father = yawn. Her constant suspicions and then when she does confront and learn the truth, she is over it in a heartbeat all because he writes her one love letter. *Rolling my eyes*And they made such a big deal about when and where to sleep together it was ludicrous... especially when the hostess had hand picked them to stay over an extra day to enable them the time alone together (as she was having her own fun).For them to go out of their way to find an Inn was so far fetched. Those old mansions were known to have back doors and hidden doors... and so if they wanted to rendezvous they simply would have on site which was much less risky than going off to an Inn risking being seen, etc...Plus to come home so late, missing dinner even made it much more obvious.In those days when they had those parties every body was sleeping with everyone else and it wasn't a big deal. Sure it was a big deal to the odd partner but they did it discreetly enough that no one knew to see it, it was behind doors. But this movie took such a simple act of them sleeping together once in five years and dragging it out into some production it was annoying.Then the rest of the movie which was very long was just the wife being suspicious and upset, etc... and the golden bowl being delivered and the store owner telling her these details about seeing her husband there with her friend and that they seemed married. Pleeeease = Such a stretch!In those days, a store owner would know that discretion was paramount to good business and there's just no way he would go into someone's house, unattended and start studying photos and collectibles to even see those pictures to identify them as a couple and then to share that info was also ludicrous.So the story was flawed and not at all an accurate depiction of the times and I found it unbearable and I kept checking the clock and I almost ditched it when there was an hour left but I thought perhaps it would improve, maybe the affair would get steamy, or something interesting would happen.But nothing interesting ever did happen.

But I think that might've been the point. Bravo./Snore.I don't read much, but I do tend to like these literary costume jobs sometimes, because I find the way people carried themselves and treated each other back in the day to be pretty interesting, most of the time in a what the hell were they thinking? sorta way. Like Thank God we've gotten past that sorta ridiculous B.S. I guess like the characters were masochists to be that way, and I guess I'm a bit of a cinematic masochist to watch them. Of course it can vary from flick to flick, but a lot of these things, both good and bad, seem to me to be about the exquisite withholding. Scorsese's Age of Innocence is the best example I can think of right now.The things that most people posting here had problems with about this movie, I think is its whole reason for being. The movie revolves around these four people, whom i think were casted and acted PERFECTLY, exactly what they were supposed to be...Jeremy Northam's Italian dude is indeed a wet noodle. He thinks he's all suave and debonair, the lady-killer, the lover, and really he's just a cheesy boob with the spine and self-knowledge of an amoeba. He's dull, weak, and boring, but of course both of the story's women find him just FASCINATING! Why? Because of course oftentimes women are total IDIOTS about the men in their lives, who they fill like empty vessels with their silly-ass romantic notions without ever actually stopping to take a good look at for who they really are. (If you're reading this and thinking I'm a chauvinistic unromantic pig, you may be right, but that does not mean I'm wrong.) So of course both women are head over heels for this clown. (He's got AN ACCENT! ...and A BEARD! ... and he's A PRINCE! Oh my god, gimme some o' THAT!)Uma Thurman plays her character like Joan Crawford or Betty Davis, and it rings true. Why, she's an American adventuress, dammit, and if she wants it all, well it's 'cuz she DESERVES it! Her character is such a conniving but bland and simple see-through bitch (played awesomely by Thurman) that I love how things go for her. She loses her cheesy lasagna lover and gets stuck with the stiff stuck-up asinine old idiot played by Nick Nolte. She gets WHAT SHE DESERVES.Kate Beckinsale is great as the porcelain doll daddy's girl who never had to lift a finger (or work a brain-cell) in her entire life. Of COURSE she's gonna go for the Italian Meatball, but be too pixie-brained, weak-willed and slathered in denial to see that he and her friend are laying pipe together in every old building in England. And of course she ends up with the Prince, who, even though he's with her, will never get over what a slime-ball he is, or ever fully be hers. She gets exactly WHAT SHE DESERVES. And bless his feeble-minded greasy heart, SO DOES HE.Lastly, Nolte's character, the first American Billionaire we're informed, is just an acquisitions man from the get-go, piling up statues and paintings and antiquities (and a daughter and then a wife) just so he can put them in a museum (tomb) in American City and say Hey, Look what I got! Come and look at all this Sh*t that you could never afford! He tells himself and others that he's doing it to give back something to the people, but he doesn't believe it himself for a minute, and neither does anybody else. And in the end, he takes his cold statue of a stupid venal wife, and his big empty pile of sh*t and goes back to install himself in his museum (tomb) along with them. He gets, in the end, exactly WHAT HE DESERVES.As do we, the blessed/cursed audience. Awesome movie, Dude. Roll Credits.p.s.I Do Wish that some ballsy filmmakers would, just once, owning the rights to some old literary masterpiece like this, would do a straight-up lavish adaptation like this one, and then change the ending so that, say, Nick Nolte's character, fed-up and despondent and enraged, takes an old battle-ax off one the grand walls and chops the other three main characters to pieces, then collapses mumbling onto the gore-filled carpet, camera slow-pushes in on his blood- spattered face.

Unfortunately it is unlikely to be watched by anyone but fans of Henry James' novels, and they will find it unsatisfactory in most of the ways that count. The symbolism comes over as creakingly obvious, and some of the performances -- Nick Nolte's in particular -- are mannered in a way that does not work in a naturalistic medium. There is a scene in which he sheds a sentimental tear that I found unbearably fake. An even more toe-curling moment comes when James Fox makes a snorting whahay! noise as he cuddles up with Angelica Huston. She however provides the most Jamesian performance of them all, cool, intelligent, principled, and yet irretrievably corrupt. Kate Beckinsale is perfect in the part of Maggie, a John Singer Sergeant portrait come to life. Uma Thurman as Charlotte provides the required blend of sexuality and desperation. But the impact of these performances is all too often dissipated by heavy-handed direction and an over-insistence on significance at the expense of naturalism. The loaded set pieces like the swashbuckling scene of Italian erotic intrigue and the peculiar oriental mime are unnecessary and laboured to death. The comic song at the Matcham weekend is incredibly irritating and yet it is brought back in over and over again. Overall the film succeeds in capturing the sense of the destructive power of the Ververs with their enormous wealth and passion for collecting things -- people as well as objects. But it does so with an over-reliance on artifice. Unfortunately much the same is true of the novel, as it is of late James in general. This project was doomed from the start.

Amid the lavish settings, four people negotiate their twisted relationships as best as they can within the confines of a repressive society, the roiling emotions neatly contrasted with the art collected by one of them, an American industrialist who ostensibly wants to erect a museum for his workers, someone resembling, say, Andrew Carnegie.Nick Nolte delivers a surprisingly effective and mature performance as Kate Beckinsale's possessive father, and the rest of the cast is quite effective. This is a slow moving film, as befits the author, perhaps, as it cannot be easy to capture the subtle motifs of a Henry James novel--but if you do not expect folks to be tossed out of windows or shoot at one another every ten minutes or so, it is an opulent snapshot of a time long gone, a world passed entirely from our view.

His lush prose matches the lushness of Merchant Ivory production values, and their casting is always interesting. Uma Thurman does not spring to mind as a likely Jamesian character, but she acquits herself well as the bold and beautiful Charlotte Verver. Nick Nolte is not bad as her mega-rich husband Adam, who she marries for his money despite being in love with the handsome but penniless Prince Amerigo (Jeremy Northham). Kate Beckinsale plays Adam's callow young daughter Maggie who marries Amerigo, unaware of his relationship with her friend Uma. Screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala doesn't try to imitate the Jamesian style but keeps the dialogue reasonably simple, though Jeremy Northam's Italian accent reminded me of the Count from Sesame Street ('ave I a number for you!) Several English stately homes including the Elizabethan Burghley House put in special guest appearances, as does Angelica Huston as an unlikely English aristocrat.As a substantial and very wordy novel has been shoehorned into 120 minutes on screen, much has been omitted and the plot line simplified. There was a 6 part TV miniseries made in 1972 which was rather less lively than this production. Even the Golden Bowl itself (gilded crystal rather than gold) meets its end at the hands of a different character in the film. Yet despite the lush setting, it is James's plot which carries the picture &#150; contrived, perhaps, but interesting nonetheless &#150; helped along by fine performances from most of the principals. Kate and Uma are able to exploit the fact that James's female characters tend to be better realised than his men. I think I'd have to say that the film is easier to watch than the novel is to read.

As a Henry James fan, I can say that The Golden Bowl is a difficult, nearly impenetrable novel, full of abstractions piled upon digressions, a house of cards.  Ivory and Jhabvala seem to have lived in this novel to an almost alarming degree, and have done what they do best they've found all the right images with which to paint Henry James's world; and they've found in all those many (and I mean _many_) words real characters with flesh and bones. Of course Ivory, like his mentor, the Indian master Satyajit Ray, has always had a knack for picking out poetic images.  In Golden Bowl, though, he seems to be doing something new.  A Room with a View, one of his earlier films, has within it all the easy narrative completion of a Shakespearean Festive Comedy.  The Golden Bowl can be likened more to the later, more difficult, and more satisfying plays.  It is more complicated and richer, and it breaks new ground for the genre that Merchant and Ivory created. How extraordinary that, late in his career, Ivory has turned his aesthetic from the beautiful to the sublime.

What can I say. I even read the novel. Did my homework. Learned that James stated that the Prince, having been educated in and lived in England, spoke with an English accent. So why oh why did M/I require Northam to adopt a fractured Italian accent? Unlike many critics however, his efforts in this area did not bother me so much as make me annoyed as they were so unnecessary.SPOILERS  MAY  FOLLOW!!!I loved how the film looked. The setting, costumes and the scenery were lush, rich and wonderfully evocative of a time and place long gone. M/I interpret this sort of thing so well. My big problem with the film did not occur to me until about half way into my first viewing in the theatre we now live in an age where infidelity in general and all that that means has been, at least in my opinion, largely trivialised into a soap opera by media/current mass values/breakdown in traditional mores/insatiable demand for movie and tv plot lines. Whathaveyou. Some viewers will strongly disagree with me, and I know that to be the victim of a faithless partner or associate is still, and always will be, personallly painful and generally hideous to live through. But I just could not get as uptight as I needed to about the dastardly flaws in marital and other relationships in this film. I was far more intrigued by the notion which came to me that the Prince, poor as dirt but with lofty desires and a family history stretching back to forever, but could not sustain unless they were funded by somebody like Nolte, could never have even contemplated taking paid contract work  and so become self supporting. The idea just did not occur to him. The times were not in tune with such a course. Instead, he opted for another sort of contract in exchange for some renovations on the crumbling pallazzo. So the Prince's tragedy, to me, was not primarily his infidelity to his wife and, indeed, to his lover, his father in law and his son, but to his own potential amd dignity. Why oh why did he need to get into a messy personal dilemma, when an ad in the Personals and a decent lawyer could have got him a rich and varied range of well paid jobs! I know, a far too 20th century take on a 19th century dilemma, and one not even hinted at in the plot, but it took my mind off the awfulness of Kate Beckinsale, and allowed me to turn my ears off whenever Huston's wavering and unstable Southern accent hit the speakers. I did not mind Nolte's performance - he seemed to me to be a reasonable personification  of the arrogance and insensitivity common to Verver's parvenu class, but something of a harsh stereotype too, as some of his class and type had real class. His love of fine things, tho' genuine, was always linked to their monetary value. As for Jeremy Northam, I liked his portrayal of a man with a moral dilemma but too little conscience. I was not entirely convinced when the plot required him to fall in love for real with his wife, but if an actress other than Beckinsale had been playing the part I may not have had a problem. Northam is always an intelligent, thinking and feeling actor, so I enjoyed watching the ambivalence he enabled his character to show he was experiencing. Overall, however, for students of Northam's movies, this is not his best work he looks uncomfortable at times, and I don't think it is all the Prince's doing. Uma Thurman satisfied me as Charlotte, but more because she shows the woman as being emotionally unhinged by her dilemma, not able to be in control of herself nor her desires,  and with a bleak and miserable future. She and the Prince do have good chemistry together altho' I never bought her as the daugher's friend. The Prince's double betrayal of her saddened me, but mainly because I indulged again in some more plot-rewriting as I watched the film and foreshadowed the misery that is in store for Charlotte as the wife of a no-doubt unforgiving Adam. Not a man to turn into a cuckold, I would guess. As a sample of genre film making, I think The Golden Bowl works OK. The slow pacing of the plot did need some tightening the film is way too long and although I do no look for shoot-em-ups every 20 minutes, cerebral cogitations and emotional angst can make the film seem very static. However, as a consolation, the supporting characters were all excellent, especially James Fox as Fanny's worldly and tolerant husband, and the randy and amoral aristocratic Lady after whose houseparty the Prince and Charlotte resume their liason.  As a way to spend 130 minutes, I'd give it 6.5 out of 10.

And by that I mean money. The true love becomes secondary in this case.The sad fact is that there is not an instance when a word coming out of the actors' mouths seems sincere-or even rehearsed. I am one who nearly always forgives a poor accent, but Jeremy Northam's attempt at Italian-accented English and Angelica Huston's Southern accent cannot meet even my low standards. The Regency aristocrat and Gangster's Moll they have previously played so successfully are much closer to their true callings.The plot is typical James (and if you haven't figured it out, James is not my favorite author)-Penniless Italian Prince (Northam) loves Penniless Heiress (Thurman) but must marry Fabulously Wealthy American Heiress (Beckensale) because her First American Billionaire and Art Collector Father (Nolte) is, well, a billionaire, and can afford to help Penniless Italian Prince fix up his run down palazzo. Now how about this for a plot twist The Penniless Heiress just happens to be the best friend of the Fabulously Wealthy American Heiress, who doesn't realize that her husband was intimate with her best friend. In the meantime, Penniless Heiress ingratiates herself to First American Billionaire and eventually becomes his wife. Things move forward predictably from there.The dialog and settings are so archly symbolic they seem almost silly. Case in point The Prince walks into a dark room where his gullible wife sits and asks, `Why are you sitting in the dark'? Soon after, the light will come on in her dim but sweet little mind. And of course, as fitting with a Merchant Ivory production, there are enough plush costumes and palatial rooms to fill up the average convention center. The gasps, significant looks, and shocked, heartbroken expressions could also fill a bushel basket. By the time the first hour was over, I looked at my watch, expecting that I had been watching for at least three hours, such was the slow pacing.Perhaps if Beckensale and Thurman had switched roles, things might have gone better, but aside from the rotten accents, Nolte looks like he would be more comfortable wearing a hardhat, flannel shirt, and jeans, perhaps leaning against the wall, drinking a beer at a San Francisco Gay Bar, talking to guys who look just like him. His modern haircut and facial hair, body language, and 20th century diction show him to be every bit as uncomfortable in the role as he must have been dressed in his evening clothes, as he was throughout the entire film. His relationship with Beckensale is just creepy, Freudian in the worst sense.It is hard to say exactly why a film like this goes wrong. Merchant Ivory hits the mark so often one expects them to come up with a near masterpiece every time.  Next time they need someone to play a broke Italian Prince, they might think about casting an English-speaking Italian.

A golden bowl (nick knack in a shop--which later by accident reveals adulterous affair) has a flaw in it that is hidden...the marriage of the billionaire's daughter (Kate Beckinsale) and the Italian prince (Amerigo/Jeremy Northam) also has a hidden flaw. There are lots of other symbols knives for instance followed by a skit of actors stabbing each other and also several replays of the 15th century murders of Amerigo's ancestor's faithless wife and her step son offering some historical foreboding of events.James was said to judge a novel based on how interesting it is...here this movie falls flat. It is a prettily filmed soap opera from 1903.I agree with another reviewer it is hard to feel sorry for these privileged cosseted people who run around all day worrying about who knew who before they were married at their stuffy lawn parties and collecting art. Nor do I view them or their lives as significant.Henry James is also kind of a preview to modern day PC stuff--couples married 40 years having a sex life(the older woman friend)...women's concerns everywhere and obvious symbolism to make you believe you have just watched something of intellectual significance.The filming is pretty. Nick Nolte is miscast and unattractive in this role as intellectual gentleman--he looks sour and mean. Jeremy Northam was unconvincing as an Italian and miscast as a man inspiring passionate interest from women.So, it is boring. What is so exciting about adultery no matter how the couples are arranged? A modern version of this would have featured incest and they would have returned on the Titanic so maybe I shouldn't complain. Using James own rating system it fails. Partly this material doesn't age well--a hundred years later the key elements of the plot are boring rather than mind bending and shocking as they were then.DO NOT RECOMMEND "}{"Title":"Beautiful but slow and curious unaffecting POSSIBLE SPOILERS","Date":"25 August 2007","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" Like all Merchant/Ivory films, The Golden Bowl is gorgeously photographed and develops at a leisurely pace, which my wife and I in this case found tedious. Moreover, perhaps because it is based on a Henry James novel and I no longer find it possible to invest much interest in James's depiction of the collision between Europeans and wealthy Americans, I was not much moved by the story it tells of the decision of an impoverished Italian prince (Jeremy Northam) to marry an American billionairess (Kate Beckinsale) while his lover, Charlotte (Uma Thurman), marries the girl's father (Nick Nolte) with the matchmaking help of Fanny Assingham (Anjelica Huston). As usual in Merchant/Ivory movies, the acting is excellent and the script is well written. But it is obvious from the beginning that the preference father and daughter display for spending their time together while their spouses accompany one another to social events will lead eventually to an adulterous relationship between Northam's character and Thurman's who were lovers before their marriages. The emotional explosions that ensue go off with the power and intensity of tiny popped balloons.

But the flawed relationships and imperfections of human nature make `The Golden Bowl,' directed by James Ivory, a perfect metaphor for the lives of the four principals involved in this story, which takes place at the beginning of the 20th Century.  Prince Amerigo (Jeremy Northam) is broke, and to restore his villa in Italy, as well as the stature of his name and lifestyle, he gives up his true love, Charlotte (Uma Thurman), to marry Maggie (Kate Beckinsale), the daughter of the first American Billionaire, Adam Verver (Nick Nolte).  Charlotte then proceeds to marry Adam, and due to some eccentricities on the part of Adam and Maggie, the four become as one big, confused and dysfunctional family, playing out their drama in England and Italy, while Adam pursues his obsessive dream of building a museum in `American Town,' which he feels will `give back' something to those who have worked their lives away in the coal mines wherein his fortune was made.  It's a world in which the priorities of those involved, however, become twisted, and truth, fidelity and all the things that really matter, become lost or disavowed; a world in which those who seemingly have a choice opt for dreary and overcast, rather than for blue skies and sunshine. 	Though the cinematography is superb and the settings lavish, the production team of Merchant/Ivory, who created and delivered such outstanding films as `Howard's End' and `Remains of the Day,' come up a bit short with this offering, which fairly plods along and simply takes too long to achieve very little in the way of insight or even just a satisfying cinematic experience.  And one of the main problems, perhaps, is the fact that the characters are people with whom you can neither identify nor relate, and as such, it is difficult to sympathize with their respective situations or to embrace their individual fixations.  These are people you simply have trouble caring about, and without that connection it puts you at arm's length, so to speak, and watching their story unfold becomes a tedious business at best.	A valid argument could be made, as well, for the casting-- or should I say, `miscasting'-- of the film, beginning with Nolte, who not only seems out of place (even playing an American), but gives a performance that seems forced and too overtly `theatrical;' this kind of acting belongs on the stage, and even there would stretch credibility.  It definitely does not translate well to film, and is simply not believable.  As he has proved in many films before, most notably in 1998's `Affliction,'-- in which his performance was instrumental in enabling James Coburn to win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor-- Nolte can act; but this just isn't the kind of role in which he excels.  Still, he must be given credit for the attempt.	The usually charming and charismatic Beckinsale also falters in this one.  Like Nolte, her performance seems forced and lacks the naturalness that would've made it at all believable.  Perhaps in attempting to internalize her feelings, as one could argue would be appropriate for a young woman of the times depicted here, she may have used a bit too much restraint, which adversely affected the perception of her character and the emotions she was attempting to convey.  And when she does finally externalize her feelings, it just doesn't seem honest.  	Northam also fails to make his character, Amerigo, believable.  A good actor, one has to wonder at the reasons behind casting him as the Italian Prince.  His accent is decent, but far from impeccable, and the lapses have a tendency to take the viewer out of the story, which breaks the continuity and dispels the drama of the film.  And while not disastrous, it is unfortunate, and the film suffers for it.	Uma Thurman probably comes closer than any of her co-stars at capturing the essence of her character, but even her performance comes across as rather tepid; physically and emotionally, she embodies Charlotte, but even her most flamboyant moments are lackluster.  And she and Northam lack the on-screen chemistry that would've created the tension needed to make the relationship between Charlotte and Amerigo a viable, believable commodity.	The saving grace of the film, performance-wise, are those of Anjelica Huston and James Fox, in supporting roles as Fannie and Colonel Bob Assingham who, though in a limited capacity, give moments of the most credibility to the overall film.	The supporting cast includes Madeleine Potter (Lady Castledean), Nicholas Day (Lord Castledean), Peter Eyre (Jarvis, the Shopkeeper), Nickolas Grace (Lecturer) and Robin Hart (Mr. Blint).  Visually resplendent, but overlong and far from engaging, `The Golden Bowl' fails to live up to the expectations of a Merchant/Ivory production.  To say that the story goes nowhere would be erroneous; it's simply a long, tiresome journey with an anticlimax that is less than satisfying.  A highly touted film, in the final analysis it can be chalked up as possibly the first misfire in the Merchant/Ivory canon.  We can only hope that Emma Thompson will be available for their next project.  I rate this one 5/10.                         "},{"Title":"Like a promising date gone bad...

The show ends nearly identically as it starts.I'm not looking for Raiders of the Lost Ark here, but the film moves at a glacial pace, and while I deeply admire each of the actors in the film (as well as Merchant and Ivory), their performances were, in my opinion, far more wooden than the characterizations required.Merchant and Ivory answered questions in person about the film after the showing I attended here in Cambridge, UK. Few people attacked the film, with the exception of a comment about the ridiculous Italian accent of Jeremy Northam (a usually fine actor). (Why not use an Italian actor for the role?) But I certainly heard little or no gushing over the work. The audience seemed deeply underwhelmed.And if you're looking for depth, hidden meaning, or metaphor, the auteurs confirmed that there is none. What you see is what they intended to show. Where they could have drawn a deeper, much more interesting picture, they exploited none of the many opportunities to do so.By the way; where is American City? The use of the name was distracting, I felt.If you loved Remains of the Day (which I did), and other slow-moving romances of this genre, you Might enjoy this film. Plan to be patient, though, and potentially unfulfilled. And do not plan to consummate your affair with this date.

You are led on to believe there is a twisted 'Love Square' going on. When really it is merely a story that could be figured out in a matter of minutes. A cheating husband, a daughter tragically attached to her father, and a best friend to betray her ( as it always your best friend that will sleep with your husband). The movies jumps with little to no detail. The dialogue lacked flow and seemed forced.***********Spoilers Ahead*********** I am quite the fan of Kate Beckinsale, and though her acting never faulted, I think it was a mistake to take the role. It made her out to be oblivious and dim-witted. To blind to see that her husband was cheating on her with her best friend, coincidently her fathers wife. Everyone around her was trying to protect her 'innocence' and yet she never acts out against it and instead remains loyal to those who kept it from her. Another mistake is that she is the main character. The story is really centered around Uma Thurman and Jeremy Northam. Their acting is believable, though I must say I found it hard to not think of Uma trying to kill bill while I watched her act hopelessly in love with a married man. The father in the story seemed oblivious but when he did appear to know he seemed to quickly forget it and go along with his plans to build a museum in American City.This movie was a waste of my time in all regards, not something to watch when you are not quite awake as you will fall asleep, not that is a problem as nothing really happens the entire middle hour and a half of the movie. So in conclusion if you are looking for relatively good acting this is an OK movie, but if you are looking for a story with decent dialogue go somewhere else or you will be very disappointed.

Jeremy Northam is more focused on his accent than his emotions.  Only Nolte is convincing in his role.  Not a good effort and not worth a video rental. "}]
