[{"Title":"Love's lost time","Date":"30 December 2005","Score":"86 out of 107 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Romance","Review":" It brought Audrey Hepburn back to the screen after an absence of eight years. It brought Sean Connery and Richard Harris back together again after their teaming in The Molly Maguires and it even brought back Connery and Robert Shaw fourteen years after they fought to the death in From Russia With Love. Unfortunately at the time of its release it did not bring back audiences to the theaters. For a movie going public acclimatized to the likes of Jaws and Rocky, a film concerned with aging and loss, corruption and mortality was not likely to find very wide acceptance. Today it is generally regarded as a classic and one of the best adult love stories ever filmed. What do heroes do when it's time to call it a day? This is the problem confronting Robin Hood, a legend in his own time, on his return to Sherwood Forest after twenty-five years of fighting in the Holy Land. Should he, as old soldiers are said to do, quietly fade away, or go out in a blaze of glory? Unfortunately Robin is, as his great adversary, The Sheriff of Nottingham wisely observes, A little in love with death. So it is unlikely he will slowly fade away. And Death hangs over the film like an unseen presence. This central theme is given visual emphasis in one of the opening shots. We see three apples set in an open window. Perfect at first, then suddenly an abrupt jump cut showing them rot. This motif of aging and corruption is repeated for the closing of the film as well. We hear Will Scarlett sing about, Following Jolly Robin to the grave. The mortally wounded Richard Lionheart confides to one of his lieutenants his dislike of the cold and dark; when Little John expresses his desire to go see his father again, he is ruefully informed by Friar Tuck that, He died years ago, John... The wistful reaction on Little John's face eloquently expresses regret too profound for words. Visually and verbally death is a constant presence. Indeed, the original script was titled, The Death of Robin Hood. With a title like that it was not going to be a rehash of Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland. And perhaps that also added to the films lackluster performance at the box-office. Audiences brought up on The Adventures of Robin Hood simply could not accept seeing these two beautiful star-crossed lovers ravaged by time, even if they were portrayed by the likes of Sean Connery and Audrey Hepburn.However like the Flynn film, Robin and Marian boasts a superb cast. Sean Connery gives one of his great performances. His Robin refuses to acknowledge the approaching infirmities of old age, and like a great ex-athlete attempts to make a comeback in a world that has long since left him behind. Nicol Williamson, woefully under-used in most films has one of his best roles as Little John, the terrible gentle giant who follows Robin with the unquestioning simplicity of a child. He and Connery have the essential chemistry necessary and make an incredibly good team. Robert Shaw brings intelligence, sensitivity and danger to the Sheriff of Nottingham, a man who will ultimately be undone because of those very virtues. Richard Harris does a magnificent turn as King Richard the Lion-hearted. Even though burnt out by years of chasing after glory, he still retains the after-glow of greatness. Ian Holm as his brother Prince John is a wonderful contrast, anxious and insecure, scheming and pleasure loving. His scene with the ambitious, equally scheming Sir Ranulf, the marvelously supercilious Kenneth Haigh, highlights another of the film's themes; the passing of the chivalric age. This is signaled by the death of King Richard, continues with the death of The Sheriff, and is completed by the deaths of Robin and Marian. Prince John and Sir Ranulf symbolize the ascendancy of the modern, hollow man, ambition without vision, loyal only to power and expediency. Prince John, is King as CEO interested only in profit, Sir Ranulf, like the armor he sports, a soulless, mechanical bird of prey. Denholm Elliot as Will Scarlett and Ronnie Barker as Friar Tuck complete Robin's band. Elliott was an actor who could express more with a simple look than most actors can with pages of dialog, and Barker has some nice ironic moments as the Friar. Finally Robin and Marian brought Audrey Hepburn back to the screen, as radiant and lovely as ever. Seeing her first in her nun's garb recalls her appearance in, The Nun's Story sixteen years earlier. Some people have an ageless beauty and Audrey Hepburn had that quality. She and Connery may be the best tragic lovers since Humphrey Bogart told Ingrid Bergman to get on that plane in Casablanca. Their scenes together are magic. When Marian asks Robin why he followed Richard during all the years of terrible carnage, Connery sums up his life with a simplicity that is breathtaking; He was my King... The film is wonderfully elegiac and the melancholic sense of time irretrievably lost is heartrending. James Goldman's screenplay is quite simply his best, surpassing his own adaptation of his play, The Lion in Winter. Unlike that film Goldman refuses to indulge in pithy witticisms at the expense of period flavor. John Barry's bittersweet score and Richard Lester's austere direction never descend into sentimentality and underscore the tragedy of the two lovers reunited after spending half a lifetime apart. David Watkins's gritty cinematography beautifully captures the squalor of life in the medieval age. Robin and Marian is a bittersweet adult love story for discriminating viewers of all ages.

I would take one of these any day than a bad remake like Robin Hood Prince of Thieves.Sean Connery is great as a weary Robing Hood back from the crusades who suddenly is rejeunivated when he meets up with Marian and the Sheriff of Nottingham.Robert Shaw is as usual, perfect in his role as the sheriff. You hate him but you can't hate him too much. He's Robert Shaw. You love to hate him.Nicol Williamson is a very good Little John, who is Robin's constant companion.Richard Harris is perfect as malevolent King Richard.Of course only Audrey Hepburn's Marian could play opposite Connery's Robin without coming off as slight.

A new telling of the Robin Hood legend with his merry men, Maid Marion, and the villainous Sheriff of Nottingham thrown in. The twist was that the characters were all older and starting to slow down and realize their youthful adventures were long past them. The core of the story is the bittersweet love story between the title characters.The true core of the film and what makes it so special is the casting. Sean Connery plays Robin Hood as the hero we all know who is slowing down despite his attempts to keep going. Audrey Hepburn is perfect as Marian. She reminds us of her eternal beauty and how truly a good actress she was. This was her first theatrical film in 9 years and it's a shame she was so little seen in that time. Actually, she was little seen after that appearing only in a few more films and none that were very memorable. Nicol Williamson plays Robin's ever faithful right hand man still trying to fight the good fight and always remaining by Robin's side. And Robert Shaw plays the Sheriff in a role he was born to play. The final swordfight between him and Robin is a highlight.Then we come to the ending. I won't give it away save to say that it's a good, albeit, very bittersweet ending. The point comes across in a way that Shakespeare may have written.It's a sweet and sometimes exciting film that is most underrated and deserves to be seen.

There is not much action here. However, the shortage of action is really quite appropriate to this particular film, which can be seen as a sequel to almost any other version you've seen. 'The Last Days Of Robin Hood' would have been as good a title as the one we have.This being a Richard Lester film, there are plenty of humorous touches. Here, they seem somewhat out of place,as the general tone of the film is bittersweet. We have a Robin Hood who is aging and aware of it, yet still has to fill the role of a legendary hero. The film portrays even better than El Cid the passing of somebody into legend, and a sense of destiny- it's more important that Robin fulfill his than opt out and not have the risk of things ending sadly. Sean Connery never did change that accent, but he could be a superb actor at times, as indeed he is here. The supporting cast is a virtual Who's Who of fine British character actors of the time, but Robert Shaw stands out as the most menacing Sheriff Of Nottingham on film.There is much in this film that is immensely touching, especially when Robin and Marian start resuming their romance which supposedly ended 18 years previously. David Watkin's gorgeous photography of the countryside is essential in giving the film it's autumnal quality. Despite the overly lengthy build up to it, the final Robin/Sheriff duel is well worth the wait, a really realistic, convincing brawl. The film is aided immensely by John Barry's music- his main theme is beautiful and deserves to be ranked among the more famous themes this great composer has written. One could easily find a more exciting and even more entertaining Robin Hood film than this, but probably not a more touching one.

It is one of my favorite movies of all time.Robin Hood is an old man now, trying to tie together some of the pieces of his ideals. The familiar characters are also still around.The most interesting thing about the movie is the insights it offers into the nature of heroism. Robin and the merry men were heroes because of what they believed in and their courage, not because they could shoot the straightest and run the fastest.The gang can't jump fences or climb walls any more, or do much of anything that requires physical exertion. Their efforts are sometimes comical. But they are still great men because of what is inside of them.Audrey Hepburn is wonderful as the aging Marian, and look for the visual poetry of the three apples which are pictured in the opening as ripe and in the ending as withered, as are Rob and Johnny and Marian. There are many such metaphorical presentations which are not often seen in movies. I like to see a little of that visual poetry, even if it is a bit clumsy.Not a great film ... not a Grand Illusion or anything, but just a nice execution of a simple, touching concept.

The only reason I didn't rate it higher is that I was hoping for more scenes with Robin & Marian together, as opposed to the men's exploits. The movie relates Robin's story from an unusual perspective, not as the legendary dashing young archer & outlaw, but as an aging hero with some physical infirmities, making him all the more appealing. But Robin Hood still has some fight left in him...The much older Robin has returned from the Crusades to Sherwood Forest, accompanied by his faithful friend and constant companion, Little John. His old love, Marian, is by this time a nun, in fact the Mother Superior of an Abbey. Politically, King Richard the Lionheart and his brother, Prince John, are basically greedy idiots and definitely no asset to the peasants. Robin's old nemesis, the Sheriff of Nottingham, is as menacing as ever, and Robin must again summon a band of loyal followers (including his old cohorts, Will Scarlett and Friar Tuck) to protect the innocent from the Sheriff's tyranny.The two stars are perfect in this mature love story, with its dramatic ending that I won't give away here. Sean Connery makes a sympathetic and compelling but weary hero, as Robin comes to grips with his aging, his physical limitations, and his mortality. Audrey Hepburn with her ageless beauty is radiant, dignified, and graceful as Marian. The pair are absolutely beautiful together on screen.Actually, the most engrossing relationship in this film might just be between the two old adversaries, Robin and the Sheriff of Nottingham, who form a sort of bond and develop mutual respect. Robert Shaw is absolutely perfect in his role as the Sheriff, who seems almost sympathetic & honourable here, not quite his usual completely villainous self. Their struggle culminates in a dramatic sword duel. Another relationship well developed is the one between Robin and his faithful friend, the gentle giant, Little John, who is portrayed by Nicol Williamson. Richard Harris plays the malevolent King Richard, though I am uncertain as to the historical accuracy of the depiction.This movie has beautiful cinematography and musical scoring. Though Robin is no longer the daring young adventurer of old, this story is much more compelling than some other adaptations, notably the vastly inferior Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves, starring Kevin Costner. Perhaps less exciting derring do than other tales, this film (to its credit) tends to humanize the mythical medieval hero. It is a touching, bittersweet, and melancholy tale of autumn in Sherwood Forest...for Robin's band of Merry Men, his lady, his foe, and especially the legendary hero himself.

Let me say at the onset that this film was simply superb, one of the best films of 1976.Richard Lester works the same magic here that he worked in his wonderful Musketeers films..he breathes new life into a timeless myth. James Goldmans script is, in fact, a meditation on old age and the passing of heroic values.Audrey Hepburn is incandescent in this, her last performance. Sean Connery, Robert Shaw , and Nicol Williamson are uniformly excellent. Connery portrays Robins heroic desperation and his undying tenderness for Marian.Nicol Williamson embodies dogged, simple minded loyalty.Robert Shaw is a stupendous villain. He interprets the Sheriff of Nottingham as a prototypical servant of the emerging nation state.In short, this is a terrific film, perhaps the greatest reworking of the legend since Errol Flynn.

A literate script by Bill Goldman's older brother, Jim, something of an anglophile despite being born and bred in Chicago - he'd already weighed in with The Lion In Winter, both stage and then screenplay plus the novel Myself As Witness, about King John, so he was right at home in the territory.  Thirteen years after From Russia With Love Robert Shaw and Sean Connery are back as adversaries though this time around there's a healthy dose of the love-hate aspect now obligatory since The Prisoner Of Zenda brought it off to a fare-thee-well.  The autumnal feel is palpable from the first image of decaying fruit and is reinforced by the muted, pastel rather than oil pastoral settings.  This leaves only the playing which runs the gamut from more-than-competent to exquisite.

The idiotic King Richard destroying the castle for a worthless piece of stone, and then like any King, ordering the messengers, Robin and John, to be executed.This folly repeats itself at the end, when Robin takes the Sheriff and his aides at their word that their duel will decide the day, but with Nottingham dead and Robin mortally wounded, we see Robin's peasants being chased and slaughtered.Lester is one of the few directors that shows how exhausting fighting with swords can be. Here the final duel to death bears resemblance to that between Michael York and Christopher Lee in 4 Musketeers. Lester and the camera catch the crow's feet in Marian's eyes as she rekindles the flame. This is so touching. And he does the impossible by letting us have a certain sympathy and respect for Nottingham, a man with a pompous idiot for a king.Who else but Goldman would have Little John lamenting that it is always Robin that gets the girl. His scene with Marian when she tries to convince him to stop Robin from the final fight is almost as painful as the last meeting of Marian and Robin, and how Little John defends the two. What a boon friend he is.Everyone has noted that Goldman also wrote Lion in Winter, but all fans of Robin should find his They Might Be Giants, which is another look at a legend,Sherlock Holmes, and mature love.Critics don't always get it right. I recall Newsweek's rewriting his review of Bonnie and Clyde, and I wonder if she were alive today if Pauline Kael would do this same for this wonderful film.

Secondly, it is a story about death the death of youthful dreams, the death of legends, the death of an heroic age to be superseded by the age of greed and pragmatism. Thirdly, it is an excellent comedy. What it is not is an escapist film where immature audiences can forget their humdrum existence for a moment to revel in the might and glory of a superhero who kicks butt. The protagonists in this film are real people. Their weaknesses, self-deceptions and errors are shown, in a humane and often very funny way. Overlaying every scene is a deep sense of melancholy, but also of optimism. This is in no small part due to the music score which mesmerizes and grips you emotionally. The acting of Audrey Hepburn and Sean Connery has never been better. The ending was as sad as it had to be. Nevertheless, you will leave the cinema in an uplifted mood.

I suppose with this one, the reason is too many people can't bear to let go of their pristine version of the Robin Hood legend, the 1938 Errol Flynn Hollywood film.  It's a shame, because ROBIN AND MARIAN manages to open up the legend in fascinating ways while still showing a great deal of affection for Robin Hood and the heroic vision that so many, both in the 13th century and today, need to believe in.Still, great jobs by Connery, Hepburn (truly the template for a beautiful mature woman), Williamson, Shaw, Holm, Barker, Elliot, Harris and the rest of the actors.  I think Goldman's script was a brilliant light companion to THE LION IN WINTER, but only light on the surface; underneath was a mature and fully realised meditation on all our twilights.  And the direction by Richard Lester was yet again masterful, one of the many reasons why he will always be among my favorite directors.

I suspect that many viewers expected a typical swash-buckling Robin Hood film, and judged this film by those standards. Such an expectation will lead to disappointment, since 'Robin and Marian' doesn't put an emphasis on action scenes(though there are a few)or serve as purely escapist entertainment.Instead it is concerned with questions of heroism and ideals that one lives by, and how they can be out of sorts in a cruel world(this is something Robin has come to realize after years of serving Richard the Lionheart in the Crusades). But at the center of the story is the reunion of Robin and Marian, and the revelation that their love is what has ultimately endured. Sean Connery and Audrey Hepburn are radiant together, both turning in some of the strongest work in their careers(the scene where Marian examines Robin's scars and removes her nun's habit is especially lovely). The two great leads are strongly supported by some of the best English character actors.My only quibble with the film is the rather rushed pacing of the last half; it could've benefited from taking a bit more development with preparation for the final battle and the sad yet affirming conclusion(those offended by the ending are clearly unfamiliar with the medieval Robin Hood ballads). But this doesn't hinder my enthusiasm for, or make me hesitate to recommend Robin and Marian.

I remember years ago going to the Reno, Nevada area and had the opportunity to visit the Ponderosa ranch house. Of course this was the set that Bonanza was shot on, but it was advertised as going to see the Cartwright estate. Though it took only a dozen or more years and with the help of electronic media in place of the bards, it's like the Cartwright clan of Nevada were real people.The years after Robin Hood helped stop Richard the Lion Hearted's throne from being usurped by Prince John didn't quite work out for a happily ever after ending. Remember in the Errol Flynn classic how the grateful Ian Hunter gave his ward Olivia DeHavilland to her true love Flynn on the understanding that they would wed?Well according to Robin and Marian, they didn't. Robin and Little John took off on the crusade and came back after Richard's death. In fact that part of the story is where we begin with Sean Connery and Nicol Williamson as Robin Hood and Little John with Richard I after he died of blood poisoning from a wound taken besieging a castle.Remember the bloodthirsty Anthony Hopkins as Prince Richard in The Lion in Winter? The same writer, James Goldman, did the script for Robin and Marian and Richard Harris as the king is Anthony Hopkins quite grown up now and full of the same blood lust. It characterized his performance in The Crusades as well. Harris gives a remarkable performance, the best in the film.Anyway after his death in the French part of the Plantagenet empire, Connery and Williamson return and find Audrey Hepburn as Maid Marian having taken the vows. Of course she forgets them right quick enough when Connery returns, who could blame her.Unfortunately Connery has absorbed a lot more of his late king that he would like to admit. The usurper Prince John is now King in fact and his old local nemesis, the Sheriff of Nottingham is still the local law in Robin's bailiwick. Robert Shaw is the sheriff and his is another good performance.Richard Lester directed an outstanding group of players in Robin and Marian. It's a look at middle-age in the Middle Ages and a lot of the same problems occurred back then as they do now.This is one of the outstanding films, one of the five best in Sean Connery's career. It should receive a lot more acclaim than it has.

I much preferred the mythical figure of the 1980s TV series that mixed myth and mystical plots . I also got slightly bored when the story started concentrating on the romance between Robin and Marion There was also a slight problem with the directing from Richard Lester where he tries to inject humour into the proceedings and it often fails . If I remember correctly this is something that spoiled his collabarition with Connery in CUBA , another movie that mixes action and romance with slight off beat humour Having pointed out these criticisms there's nothing much else wrong with ROBIN AND MARION , it's just that when you've got a bunch of butch men in a forest who dabble in swordplay in 2004 you're instantly reminded in some small way of a certain film trilogy that was released at the turn of the century which does spoil the positive aspects of this movie when watching it today .

When the Salkinds (Ilya and his father Alexander Salkind) were in the midst of filming ¨Superman¨ (1978) simultaneously with its sequel, Lester was hired as a supervising producer, then took over the filming of the sequel, ¨Superman II¨ (1980), when original director Richard Donner was fired . The sequel was a financial and critical success , and he was hired to direct the far-less successful ¨Superman III¨ (1983). At the end of the 1980s, Lester returned to the storyline that had revitalized his career back in the early 1970s, filming a second sequel to The Three Musketeers titled  ¨The return of the musketeers¨ . However, after his close friend, actor Roy Kinnear died during the shooting , Lester seemed to lose heart with the movie-making business , he has not directed another film.Other versions about this famous personage are the followings  ¨Robin Hood price of thieves (1991) ¨ by Kevin Reynolds with Kevin Costner , Alan Rickman and Morgan Freenan , the same year was exhibited ¨Robin Hood¨ by John Irvin with Patrick Bergin and Uma Thurman but was a flop though the critics considered best adaptation . Plus , ¨Robin Hood¨ (2010) by Ridley Scott with Russell Crowe , Cate Blanchett , Mark Addy , Kevin Durand . The classic rendition is ¨The adventures of Robin Hood¨ by Michael Curtiz with Errol Flynn and Olivia De Havilland.

The latest one was Robin an Marian (1976). Of course, having never seen it, I was expecting another rehash of Errol Flynn and little fluffy gay guys running around in bright green tights but I can say that I was pleasantly disappointed!As we all know Sean Connery, born 1930, made his mark in films during his 30's in the 1960's doing James Bond. Unfortunately, the scripts were horrible, the acting was hackney, and he wore a nasty 'rug' on his head during those films. But fortunately for his future ... and ours ... those roles propelled him into the beginnings of stardom. During the mid 1970's he abandoned the mainstream and grew into more serious roles worthy of major note. He also grew his trademark beard and threw the 'rug' in the garbage.So back to Sherwood Forest the film is set as a comeback of Robin Hood to Nottingham and Sherwood as an aged Robin returning home after spending two decades in the Crusades. Disillusioned, tired, and old; just looking to come home. 'King' John is still ruling the roost and Marian has joined a nunnery as an implied rebuke to Robin's deserting her. Of course, the storyline is obvious Robin Hood (Sean Connery) fights with the Sheriff of Nottingham (Robert Shaw) to win back Maid Marian (Audrey Hepburn) and live happily ever after. The standard Sherwood Forest gang is there in support as expected.My concern was that this would just be a regular Hollywood 'men-in- tights' rendition spandex tights, overdone makeup, hokey swordplay, awful dialog, and cheesy punchlines. Much to my relief it wasn't! DIALOGUE Not the best but acceptable. One redeeming factor was that the script writers spared us a load of 'thee' and 'thou's of the expected old English verbiage. Down to earth without verbosity.SCREENPLAY Actually very well written. The continuity was well laid out without any logic gaps or leaps of faith. Believable.STAGE AND PROPS Excellent is the only word for it! Everything was totally believable as to being period and authentic. Houses, saddles, swords, kitchenware, housewares, 'honey' pits, forest paths, weapons of combat, and the arena of battle were completely true. This really surprised me! MAKEUP So well done you couldn't notice it. Ms. Hepburn couldn't pass up her essential eye makeup but thankfully she left the curling iron, lipstick, and nail polish at home. When Robin mussed up her hair it stayed mussed. Rather than paint thick gooey layers of paint on the actors to represent the realistic lack of showers the director must have just had the actor roll on the ground for a bit; a relief from modern makeup attempts. COSTUMES All period and extremely realistic right down to Robin's 'under'clothes. No tights to be seen ... except for on one of King John's 'favorite' boys as he heads off to France. Of note is that Robin wears Saracen armor in the final battle scene an aspect other directors would miss.CINEMATOGRAPHY This was my major disappointment. The whole film was done in subtle sepia with all exterior shots slightly blurred. It was 'fad' for this era in English film-making to use the Fairies in the Glen effect. Just not my choice makes the film look cheap. Though, thanks to the director, the compositions were well considered and effective.ROLES Sean Connery was absolutely stellar, Hepburn generally less so but still very good. Robert Shaw also gave Connery a run for his money; well played without the stereotype slimy sheriff thing. The rest of the cast performed adequately.Probably the best part of the movie was the final fight scene between Robin and the sheriff. Better than classic swordplay with broadswords weighing 30+ lbs. (no superheroes on that battleground!!!)Of course we all know how it is supposed to end up ... but don't leave before the final act! It doesn't end the way you expect. TRUST ME! Overall a tour d force for Sean Connery! One of his best. No wonder he rates as one of the top 5 actors of the 20th Century in my book.

While I can't claim to be a fan of the Errol Flynn movie, I'll admit that it's not bad for what it is (and infinitely preferable to the Kevin Costner debacle, which came across like an unfunny episode of the TV spoof WHEN THINGS WERE ROTTEN). For me, ROBIN AND MARIAN takes up where the original story left off and is about as bittersweet a swan song as you're ever likely to see. The seemingly perpetually smirking Robert Shaw (who looks not unlike an older Errol Flynn himself) gives a rich, two-toned performance that is not all bad and even lends his end its own poignancy. Sean Connery and Audrey Hepburn are merely magic together, in understated but ultimately powerful performances.

I was certain that this would be another adaptation of the legend of Robin Hood and I must say that I was looking forward to it. I'm not going to say that this is exactly the type of movie that I constantly want to see, but when I get the chance to watch a movie with famous actors like Sean Connery, Audrey Hepburn, Robert Shaw and Richard Harris, I'll certainly not let it pass without watching it.As I already said in the previous paragraph, this movie tells the story of Robin Hood and Lady Marian. However, this time we don't get to see him in the prime of his life. Robin Hood is an old man when he returns with his best friend Little John to England after the crusades and Marian has become a nun. Robin Hood no longer seems capable of great action, but when the Sheriff of Nottingham once again threatens Sherwood, it doesn't take long before he gathers his still loyal men around him together with many peasants and villagers who are tired of the Sheriff's tyrannic behavior...At first it all took some time to get used to the new concept. No-one has ever shown Robin Hood as an old man who is still willing to fight, but who has to deal with several physical restrictions. That's not exactly the image that we have of him, but I must say that it worked. It was original and the new approach to the subject made sure that this is a movie that doesn't immediately gets lost in the bunch of other Robin Hood movies. But the original approach to the story isn't the only good reason why you should give this movie a try. Sean Connery is a very worthy Robin Hood, Audrey Hepburn did an excellent job with her role as Maid Marian and Robert Shaw was very nice to watch as the Sheriff of Nothingham.As a conclusion I would like to add that all the fans of the Robin Hood movies who aren't afraid to see their hero as an old man, should give this movie a try. It's original, it's different and it's daring, but it works. And even when you aren't too much a fan of this story, then you should still watch the movie for the interesting performances from this very nice and interesting cast.

Sean Connery is perfect as the idealistic, but not too smart and defintitely aging Robin, and Audrey Hepburn is enchanting as the middle-aged Marian, who has become an abbess during Robin's long absence. Robin returns from the Crusades to England after King Richard's death just in time to see the Sheriff of Nottingham come to arrest Marian. Nobody wants him to be a hero anymore, especailly Marian, who is perfectly willing to be taken into custody, but he insists on rescuing her. It is just wonderful to see Robert Shaw, as the world-weary Sheriff, lean over the pommel of his horse and say imploringly, Robin, we don't have to do this. In fact, Robert Shaw has many fine moments in this movie check out his exasperated effort to show his men how to get serious about swordfighting, or his attempt to warn an idiot Sir Guy about the dangers of Sherwood.    There are many delights here. When Robin and Little John escape a trap at the Sheriff's castle by climbing the castle gate, they do not  scamper up effortlessly Errol Flynn style, but huff and puff and struggle like real middle-aged men. Another plus is the fighting, which captures as no other film has how brutal, difficult, and exhausting medieval battle was. The duel between Robin and the Sheriff near the end is an eye-opener. And the end of this movie is perhaps one of the most movingly romantic ever put on film. Listen to Marian's final speech -- it will stay with you.

Not far short of thirty years on, he has scarcely changed in the interim and could easily take the same part at the age of 73.  There'd be no place for the excellent Nicol Williamson, the reassuring Denholm Elliott or the phenomenal Robert Shaw in such a script, of course.That said, I first fell in love with this movie when I was quite young (I'm still only 38 at the time of writing), and was amazed some years later when it was re-shown on television to see it summarised in the Radio Times as apparently a weak effort.  I couldn't disagree more with that assessment; the wonderful, wonderful script by James Goldman, perfectly balancing a late blooming love story with shades of regret, humour and action, is brought to life by this cast-iron cast.Upon re-viewing, I realise I had neglected Robert Shaw as the Sheriff of Nottingham.  My favourite kind of villain is the one who regards his adversary as kind of an old friend, and Shaw pulls this off really well.  In the scene when he first meets Robin after the latter's return from the wars, he makes it clear that he has to take Marian, but he says, God go with you.  Nowadays, it's almost shocking to see Robin almost casually killing the guards who have been sent to attack him, but then Shaw's Sheriff views the dead bodies and gives them their due as soldiers Take up their limbs and bury them.  Shaw does most of his acting with his eyes, and you can see the whole life of regret, valueless death and his own lost advancement, in them.The love story is beautifully handled, but it has to be said that the chief and most memorable relationship in the movie is that between Robin and Little John.The opening of the movie is something else that would never survive a modern cut an entire sequence set at the time of the crusades with an incredible cameo by Richard Harris as his namesake, the Lionheart, along with other British stalwarts like Esmond Knight, Bill Maynard and Peter Butterworth.  These characters are all amazingly well fleshed out, considering they take no part in the main body of the story.  This is one of the few portrayals, if not the only one, of Richard the Lionheart which clings closer to what was probably his true character - far from the heroic king, kept hostage and kept from his beloved England by the war with the Muslims, the real Richard never spent much time in England even after his return from the Crusades, preferring to prosecute a war of conquest in France (he probably only spoke French).  This Richard is not driven by religious righteousness, but by the greed which was the real motivation for the wars of the day.The main portion of the film, however, is set in a recreation of twelfth century England, in its heartland - a land of decay and poverty being overtaxed by grasping landlords - a perfect backdrop for a story of regret and opportunities missed.

Sean Connery and Audrey Hepburn perfectly embody these roles with a depth of realism. They take these mythical figures and make them live. Marian was the perfect role for the 46 year old Hepburn to portray, and no doubt it was the quality of the script and the fascinating premise of the story which were able to lure her back to the silver screen after a nine-year absence. (Unfortunately none of her subsequent film roles were of this caliber.) The supporting cast is solid, a real ensemble of some of the greatest British actors. Richard Lester's direction is masterful. The screenplay brings great romance and irony to the relationship of Robin and Marian. The cinematography is beautiful without painting the tragic nature of the tale in rosy hue.

Robin and Marian is, in my opinion, the best Robin Hood film ever made or that ever will be made. I would refute the criticism that it is for an older audience. When I saw it first I was 27 tears old and working as a projectionist in a theatre that ran the film shortly after release. Forty years later the sublimity of its vision has only deepened though it was apparent right from the firs. Let us now, however, consider its director, Richard Lester. No director has ever had a career of perfect films but Lester's has a few more than many.Starting with The Running, Jumping and Standing Still Film that showcased the antics of the Goons (yes, folks, there was a predecessor to Monty Python) and The Beatles' two movies, Lester built a style and competence in storytelling with a mix of humor, drama and great humanity. His The Three and Four Musketeers remain the best Musketeers movies ever made and Juggernaut is the sole disaster movie made in the late 1960s and 1970s that remains worth watching decades later. Add to those Petulia, A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, How I Won the War, The Knack and The Ritz and you have a body of work of which any director could be proud. We may love Errol Flynn's Robin Hood or Alan Rickamn's Sheriff of Nottingham but no prior or subsequent film is anything like as beautiful as this film. The whole film is worth watching for the scene between Connery and Hepburn when she discovers the battle scars on his body or for Robert Shaw's disdain of the ignorant noblemen who've come to him from Ian Holm's sniveling King John. Like the arrow shot from Nicole Williamson's bow in the final scene this film rises up into the sky and simply never comes down.

He was in so many films in the 60s and 70s and as expected is excellent. He has an unusual, expressive, almost pained face and voice. Sadly missed, he was once described by John Osborne as the greatest actor since Marlon Brando. He was also described by Samuel Beckett as touched by genius and viewed by many critics as the Hamlet of his generation during the late 1960s (Wikipedia). Top marks also to director Richard Lester for capturing the spirit of the age and for keeping it earthy and 'real', something he achieved brilliantly in others films such as The Three Musketeers. Also for John Barry for his beautiful, emotive score. When did he ever fail to produce the goods? What were people thinking of in giving this the cold shoulder on its release?

Sean Connery is excellent as the ageing hero Robin, a type of character that he would later revisit in the unofficial Bond film Never Say Never Again, while Audrey Hepburn delivers a charming and wonderfully understated performance as Marian. In their only film together, they have great chemistry and you never doubt for a second that Robin and Marian are in love. The storyline is very strong and the supporting cast is excellent, particularly Robert Shaw as the Sheriff of Nottingham, Richard Harris as Richard the Lionheart (who is depicted much more realistically than in any other Robin Hood film that I've seen) and Nicol Williamson as Little John.

Robin is watching himself grow old and (ever the outlaw) is rebelling against it, Marian has a death wish associated with lost love and trying to hold on to the Robin of her youth.There's layer upon layer of legend-twisting here In the fables about the death of Robin Hood, the evil Prioress of Kirkley Abbey poisons him on behalf of the Sheriff of Nottingham. Here, his death becomes a gift of mercy bestowed by love.Reality contrasts fantasy in the treatment of the historical Richard the Lionheart. His death is portrayed almost precisely as it actually happened, but to an audience conditioned to see him as a legendary hero (who doesn't associate him with Sean Connery?) it's a shock to see him as the tyrannical and capricious murderer he really was. Meanwhile the fictional characters of Robin and Marian are fleshed out with fully human flaws and frailties.James Goldman (who wrote the story and screenplay and is best known for The Lion in Winter, his delightfully literate soap-opera about those wacky Plantagenets) effectively plays with our perceptions of heroic legend and our own inevitable demise.

The evil sheriff had finally been defeated and Robin was once again the victor, but while he was high on the strength of his win, Marion knew his race was won and there would be no more days like these. Although she had been in a convent for many years her love for Robin was as strong as ever and rather than watch him decline and either end his life in chains or at the point of the sword of some inferior warrior she eased his way from this world to the next and made sure he died as he had lived as a hero.

I assume that is what was going through the casting director's head when she approached this film.Robin and Marian shows us a Robin Hood story we haven't seen before. Rather than an origin story, we get an outcome story. This is a welcome approach to a tale that has been told so many times that it could easily become dull.In other Robin Hood films, such as the 1922 silent film staring Douglas Fairbanks, 1991's Robin Hood Prince of Thieves starring Kevin Costner, and 2010's Robin Hood staring Russell Crowe, Robin's adventures begin after he returns from the Third Crusade. We're asked to believe that a crusader who had fought alongside the king in the Holy Land would settle down in Sherwood Forest to frolic with Maid Marian, Friar Tuck and the Merry Men.In Robin and Marian, we learn that Robin's best-known adventures passed 20 years before the events in the film--before Robin joined the crusade. Robin (Connery) has become disillusioned with the crusade after King Richard the Lionheart (Richard Harris, Dumbledore from the first two Harry Potter films) orders his men to attack a crummy, undefended castle for a treasure that doesn't exist. After Richard dies, Robin returns to Nottinghamshire and resumes his relationship with Maid Marian (Hepburn), who has since become a nun, and his rivalry with the Sheriff, all of whom are older and wiser. Robin's old gang comes back to him, and they dream of rising up against the notorious King John (Ian Holm, Bilbo Baggins from The Lord of the Rings).The youthful innocence of Robin's adventures in Sherwood and his love with Marian is long gone. We learn that Marian attempted suicide after Robin left her. Robin's experience in the crusade has also caused him to mature. Even though Connery is 45 in this movie, he doesn't look a day over 63. Their love now has the maturity of an old couple, and there is no denying there is real chemistry between Connery and Hepburn, which allows the characters to rise above the material.The Sheriff is played by Robert Shaw, resuming his adversarial role against Connery that commenced in the 1963 Bond film From Russia with Love. Shaw is grim, but sympathetic, as the Sheriff of Nottingham, and is the best Sheriff of any Robin Hood film.Robin and Marian is a fun film. With the exception of some heavy- handed dialog early on in which the characters talk about historical events that would have been well-known in their day in order to educate the audience, the movie is both playful and touching. The film has effective situational humor throughout, using both slapstick and irony.The scenes between Connery and Hepburn all find the right tone, and the film has a somewhat faded look that helps create a nostalgic atmosphere. However, the fights look clumsy. Director Richard Lester could have taken tips on staging fights from Connery's earlier Bond films. Another technique Lester often employs is to show someone shooting an arrow, cut away, then have the victim with an arrow through his head fall into the frame. This is about as gruesome as the filmmakers could get considering the PG rating (this was before PG-13 was created).Unlike the most recent Hollywood Robin Hood film, this one doesn't pretend so much to be historically accurate, so I won't complain about historical inaccuracies such as Kings Richard and John speaking English, rather than French, or Robin Hood speaking in a thick Scottish accent.Movie connections Sean Connery would go on to play King Richard in Robin Hood Prince of Thieves, as well as appear with Ian Holm in Time Bandits--another film with the Robin Hood character. His son, Jason Connery, played Robert of Huntingdon in the British TV series, Robin of Sherwood.

Every time I revisit it I like it more.  The basic story has Robin and Little John, the nucleus of Sherwood Forest's storied Merry Men, winding up their prolonged tour of duty in the Crusades, disillusioned with the holy war and with the King to whom they pledged undying loyalty. The real focus of the film kicks in once the two return to England, after the death of King Richard.The movie's real strength, I think, is in its actors -- the thing is packed to the rim with fine actors the likes of Sean Connery, Audrey Hepburn, Richard Harris, Denholm Elliot, Ronnie Barker, Robert Shaw, and more. Sean Connery's one of those actors, like Gene Hackman and a few others, who make even a dreary or substandard movie eminently watchable.  He's the perfect Robin Hood, believe it or not, albeit a Robin Hood slightly more realistically heroic and flawed than usually presented.  This Robin is recognizable as the Robin of myth but the movie's storyline makes it plain that he was a man mythologized beyond his capabilities by a populace that needed a hero larger than any one man's life.  I like that.  His constant companion, Little John, is similarly heroic but neither is a fool and the story profits for revealing their humanity and taking a little of the impossibly heroic gloss off the legend.  Also integral to the concept of this movie is that 20 years have passed since the events immortalized in literature and later in the movies, and some of the characters' mutterings make it clear that they're feeling the passage of time quite intensely.Although the film's title promises a focus on Robin and Marion, it's really a 'boys' film,' and the real chemistry remains squarely between Robin and John, with the next most developed and complex relationship being that between Robin and the Sheriff of Nottingham.  Marion runs a distant third. That's not to say that Audrey Hepburn isn't great in her role -- it's hard to imagine a better Marion, actually -- it's just that the real focus of the story (as I see it) is on the fatal triangle between the two former outlaws and their old nemesis.The entire cast does their job spectacularly.  Richard Harris is great as a bombastic, out-of-control, psychopath version of Richard the Lionhearted. This Richard's a vain, self-centered murderer who is undoubtedly as brave and rugged as legend would have it but who perhaps believes too strongly in his divine right to do whatever the heck he wants.  Richard Harris' over-the-top performance is perfect for his role and generates some comic elements, even under the direst of circumstances.  The same's true of the entire movie -- it's laced with humor, especially in the dynamic between Robin and John, though one of my favorite bits goes like thisMarion - You never wroteRobin - I don't know howThis film's not one that goes for belly-laugh comedy, but a sense of humor is apparent throughout.  Even the scene in which Robin and John escape over the walls of the Sheriff's castle -- convincing because it's heroic, daring, and all the rest of it and yet is not as acrobatic and faultless an escape as it would have been in any other Robin Hood film -- ends with a bit of humor.  In this movie you even get to see Sean Connery in a ridiculous hat.Sean Connery's deadpan delivery, sardonic expression, and that perpetual twinkle in his eye are all at full potency in this film and some of the expressions on his face, alone, will cause you to crack a smile.  Like I said, he's the perfect Robin Hood, 20 years on.  The voice doesn't hurt, either.  Hood...Robin Hood.The dude who plays King John -- if Richard is Lionheart then John is the Cowardly Lion -- is convincing as an effete incompetent.  Actually, truth be told, right down to the way he looks this character reminds me of George W. Bush, and he's similarly out of his depth with the affairs of state.Robert Shaw perfectly captures the Sheriff in an understated performance that turns what is usually a one-dimensional 'villain' role into something rather more interesting.  I don't know whether the passage of time has mellowed this film's version of the Sheriff or if the film's internal history would have him having always been that way, but Shaw actually plays a fairly sympathetic 'bad guy,' one who obviously has far greater empathy for Robin than for his peers and the simpering new king's nobles.  He's actually, as played in this film, pretty much a 'good guy.'  He seems a decent man who is doing his job, the long-standing feud with Robin being evident but not as vicious as normally played -- this is even evident in the final duel, that features two over-the-hill warriors flailing about in the heavy garb and with the heavy weapons of the time.  The Sheriff's an honorable man in this iteration, a definite departure from the Robin Hood movies that I remember seeing in my youth, and the film's infinitely better for this characterization.The ending's a bit of a downer, mainly because I wanted he and Marion (and the others) to live to become even older codgers, but it's consistent with the rest of the film, is probably (as Robin says) better this way, and ties in neatly with the original tale.  In all, this is a classic movie and I think it's one that would be difficult to not enjoy.  The cinematography's very nice, too, and the props and costumes evoke a sense of realism that's both heightened by some of the characters (one example being Robin's falling just a tad short of the lofty heroic ideal that's been attributed to him in his absence from England) and undermined, deliberately, by some of the subtle self-reference and humor integral to the film.

To those who take this view, I would generally say they are missing the point.  Indeed, any story of Robin Hood in his mid-to-late forties that had a happy ending would be either unbelievably dull or simply unbelievable.Instead, this film is a loving tribute to three people who hold to romantic ideas, both in love and in war, but whose time has past them by.  Disillusioned by the one man he chose to follow during his time in Sherwood and during the Crusades (Richard the Lionhearted, played by Richard Harris in a wonderfully psychotic performance), Robin elects to return to Sherwood and believes time has stood still.  Likewise, for the Sheriff of Nottingham (Robert Shaw) time has equally stood still, as he sees his battle with Robin as a model of the old feudal system -- man to man, where honor still prevails.  Unfortunately, time has passed him by as well, in the person of the feckless and devious Sir Ranulf (Kenneth Haigh).  Finally, there is Maid Marian, believing that sacrificing herself will save the abbey she has entered from the ravages of King John's greed.The story wends its way beautifully to a tragic (but incredibly effective) conclusion, thanks to wonderful performances from the entire cast.  Connery and Hepburn are magnificent, as is Robert Shaw in a wonderfully shaded performance.  Likewise, Denholm Elliott, Ronnie Barker, and (especially) Nicol Williamson offer great support as the remnants of Robin's merry band.  The performers, James Goldman's underrated script, and Richard Lester's tasteful direction do a marvelous job in conveying the message that, while a time of honor and devotion to something greater than money and power may be passing, they are still needed in this world.

When Sean Connery appeared as King Arthur in First Knight he achieved the rare distinction of having played the heroes of both legends on screen.Robin and Marian was one of a number of period pieces made by director Richard Lester during the seventies; others include The Three Musketeers and Royal Flash. The idea was to take a more realistic view of the Robin Hood legend than the romanticised version familiar from the well-known Errol Flynn film or the British television series starring Richard Greene. This version presents us with a middle-aged Robin who has spent the last twenty years fighting in the Crusades with King Richard the Lion-Heart. (In reality Richard's reign only lasted ten years). After Richard is killed while besieging a castle in France, Robin and his right-hand man Little John return to England where they are reunited with his merry men in Sherwood Forest, where they spearhead a rebellion against King John, the tyrannical new ruler of England. Robin is also reunited with his former lover Maid Marian who has become a nun (indeed, a Mother Superior) in his absence. Her vows of poverty, chastity and obedience, however, do not prevent Marian from abandoning her religious vocation and rushing back into Robin's arms.The main part of Audrey Hepburn's film career ended with Wait until Dark in 1967, following which she was absent from the screen for nine years, an absence caused by events in her private life. She made occasional attempts at a comeback in the late seventies and eighties, but none of these were particularly successful. Robin and Marian strikes me as being an unsuitable vehicle for her first comeback after her nine-year absence, because she is in many ways quite wrong for the part. The grizzled, balding Connery does indeed look convincingly middle-aged- older, indeed, than his real age of forty-six. Hepburn was actually a year older than Connery, but here looks far younger than her real age of forty-seven, making it seem that Marian is not Robin's contemporary but a woman nearly young enough to be his daughter.Moreover, any sense that Robin is an ageing man whose powers are in decline is lost as soon as he and Little John manage to escape from Nottingham Castle by scaling the walls, a feat of athletic derring-do as remarkable as anything performed by Flynn or Greene in their versions of the story and which in real life would probably have been beyond the powers even of an Olympic athlete. This is not, however, the first improbability in the story. The tone is set with the death of King Richard. The arrow which kills him is thrown by hand by a one-eyed old man, but nevertheless has enough force to penetrate his armour and cause a fatal wound. (In reality the arrow was fired from a bow in the normal manner and killed Richard because he was not wearing armour at the time).Then we have the scene where a group of nuns are supposedly being held prisoner in a castle but are allowed to wander freely about the courtyard and escape by running out of the main entrance before the guards can lower the portcullis. (Didn't the Sheriff of Nottingham realise what a dungeon is for?) In the final showdown between Robin and his enemies, Robin unaccountably leads his followers out of Sherwood Forest, even though their archery skills out them at an advantage over mounted knights in the dense woodland. Robin then challenges the Sheriff to single combat, which he equally unaccountably accepts even though his numerically superior forces would have the advantage in open fields. Finally, Marian brings the proceedings to an end by inexplicably poisoning both Robin and herself. (If Robin's wounds had been fatal her motivation might have been understandable, but there is no evidence that this is the case).The film reunites Connery with Richard Harris, with whom he had acted in The Molly Maguires, but this is not a film in the same class as that one. Harris gives an eccentric performance as King Richard, playing him as a cruel, ranting and almost comically capricious tyrant, which made me wonder just why Robin and Little John had served him loyally for so long and just what was so bad about King John that he was regarded as a change for the worse.None of the acting performances, in fact, really stand out. Connery is probably the best. It may seem odd to have Robin Hood speaking in a Scottish accent, as indeed does Little John, Nicol Williamson also being a Scot. The English spoken in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, however, would have been something halfway between Anglo-Saxon and Chaucerian Middle English, very different to the modern language, so it would have been a bogus form of authenticity to try and make Robin speak like a modern East Midlander.The love scenes between Robin and Marian are done well enough to suggest a genuine passion between them, although the film does not explore in any depth the potential conflict between Marian's love for Robin and her love for God. Overall, however, I felt that the film contained too many eccentricities and implausibilities to be taken seriously. It cannot compare with the Errol Flynn version. 4/10 "},{"Title":"Bitter-sweet and quirkily funny","Date":"16 April 2016","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Romance","Review":" Bitter-sweet and quirkily funny.It is 20 years after Robin Hood's heroics against Prince John and the Sheriff of Nottingham.

Following on from what many consider to be his best role outside of James Bond, that of Daniel Dravot in The Man Who Would Be King, Sean Connery plays Robin Hood (a balding, grey bearded, bruised, scarred and arthritic one, but still Robin Hood) opposite the still impossibly gorgeous Katherine Hepburn as Maid Marian. This is no swashbuckling agile Douglas Fairbanks, Errol Flynn or Kevin Costner. This is a much bleaker, more realistic Robin. But still a Robin who could not resist a good fight, and was trying to regain his youth by reliving past exploits. Robert Shaw's arrogant but intelligent Sheriff of Nottingham was everything you'd expect from the hard drinking Irish man. It was a shame he would die only two years later, as for all his flaws he was one hell of an actor.The final fight between Robin and the Sheriff was brutal as two worn out old men (barely able to lift their swords towards the end) hacked away at each other. The mood of the movie is realistically bleak at times, yet since Richard Lester was director, we get some silly scenes with humour in that seem to be totally out of place and that almost belong in another movie!! I don't know why he insisted on doing this in his movies (see Superman 2, where during Superman battling the three Kriptonian Super Villains a load of awful comedy scenes (wigs flying off, ice cream hitting people in faces) are present that takes away from the intensity of it all!! Of the supporting cast Richard Harris has a cameo as Richard The Lionheart (same role Connery would cameo in Costner's Prince Of Thieves) and Denholm Elliot is as reliable as ever.I think this movie is badly under appreciated by the critics.

Some of the attempts at humor are misjudged (is it meant to be funny when Robin slugs a stubborn Marion to save her from captivity?), but the film has a surprisingly gritty texture, mixing undiluted Hollywood soap with some convincing medieval squalor.

Although there's always a wonderful lightness in this film, thethemes it handles - and handles very well - are serious andmature. The nature of the friendship between men, and how ittakes second place to pride, or principle, is explored in the scenesbetween Connery and Robert Shaw, which are among the finestscenes in cinema history. I first saw this film when I was about 12,and didn't like it at all. When I was 20 I saw it again and this time Iunderstood it. I like films that you only get when you're old enough.Audrey Hepburn is unusually non-annoying - in most of herpictures I hate her child-like enthusiastic bounciness. She's wiseand measured and dignified and rather lovely, even if her hair isterrible. Nicol Williamson is always pretty annoying, and he is inthis movie. I also usually hate Connery, but I can live with him inthis.  The film's just wonderful. Really, it's full of actors I can't stand, butit's wonderful. It's about men, and I haven't seen a better film aboutmen. It's constantly surprising, always intelligent, and beautifullyunderstated. Can we have an official Dick Lester re-evaluationplease?

If the dull plot of the movie itself is a letdown, the ending **spoiler alert** of having Marian kill Robin off by poisoning him and taking the drink herself too - what is the point in that? Seems more like politically correct indoctrination that if your (or your love's) life is boring, too much of a bother, or something you just do not want to endure anymore, then it is okay to end it? Ick! The Marian I want to believe in would have aged with more grace and wisdom than that! She should have realized better the power woman have over men and inspired Robin to live the life that earned him legendary status. The acting isn't that bad, but it is not a plot that appeals (obviously) to me. The best part of the movie may be the realistic costumes and sets, if they are true to the period, otherwise this movie just seems a way for the actors to collect a paycheck.

The characters are the same but the great catch here is that they're middle aged now and almost powerless, starting to lose strength and many other skills, and even becoming more philosophical and having more ethical feelings.Sean Connery plays an middle aged Robin Hood who after 20 years fighting in the Crusades and the death of the insane King (Richard Harris) decides, along with his friend Little John (Nicol Williamson) to return to the forest of Sherwood to rejoin Lady Marian (Audrey Hepburn) and marry with her. But things are different in Sherwood and with Marian because she thought Robin abandoned her and now she's a devoted nun. And while the sparks between these two doesn't fly high Robin and his old friends Will Scarlet (Denholm Elliott) and Tuck (Ronnie Barker) got some extra time to fight against the greedy and vain Sheriff of Nottingham (Robert Shaw) and his knights. Don't except much of a big adventure with danger all over the place and some risky, fast and frightening moments. No. Here Robin and Little John are facing the same dangerous things but they have a very truthful disadvantage they're old, they can't barely jump or run or even held a sword against their enemies and they're gonna need all the help they can get. And Robin still has to deal with some confused feelings that Marian has towards him but they still love each other. Like Ringo Starr used to say in one of his songs Things don't come easy on anyone here. Robin and Marian is another good proof that people get old, many things will change but some values and some feelings are still the same. Delightful, funny, with many unforgettable moments (the ending was fabulous) director Richard Lester's film is a great entertaining work. The screenplay written by James Goldstone preserved the original characteristics of the characters but the only thing that didn't worked too well was the excessive melodramatic scenes between Connery and Hepburn, these scenes run for too long and takes you out of the movie for a while, nothing so bad but it could've been better written and developed. Acting is superb, all the casting are great and it was very nice to see Connery and Denholm Elliott making a team thirteen years before of Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade (the funny thing is that I watched both films on the same week and they're both great in both films). Nicol Williamson has some of the greatest moments of the film playing Robin's loyal friend. He and Connery helping the nuns to escape of the Prison City is priceless, they can't even make a move trying to get out of the gates without losing their breath. Returning from a long period without making movies Audrey Hepburn goes very well as Marian and got her best role in the 1970's (the other one in Bloodline is not that good). Don't miss the awesome fight between Robin and the Sheriff, one of the best fight scenes I've ever seen and a lesson to the filmmakers of this fast-shaky camera generation who doesn't know how to plan a movie and allow people to see who's punching who in a scene. Not only is a good planned scene but it's interesting to see two old timers fighting with all of their force (by that I meant that Robin is using only a sword while the coward Sheriff uses another weapon along with the sword and both men can't barely stand on their feet). Worth seeing any time, any day, any occasion. 9/10 "},{"Title":"LOL dis sukcs a$$ yo!","Date":"11 August 2008","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Romance","Review":" I bet a lot of people find this movie boring. It's just a psychological mechanism, their brain can't process the fact that death and decay are what awaits all of us. This movie takes the classic Hollywood ideal of heroism, and goes beyond the moment of victorious glory, following the characters to their demise.This is the theme of the movie. Death and decay, yet in a very lively way. Although old, scarred and dying, these characters are more alive than any other version of Robin Hood ( and anything similar ). The viewer who doesn't suffer from ADD can get to know and like Robin and Marian, not because these people are GOOD and HEROIC, but because they are HUMAN. This Robin wakes up with a hangover, he makes Marian laugh by acting goofy, he endearingly mistreats his friends, he gets tired easily, he kills his opponents brutally, and each time he does it, you feel. There is no horde of faceless CGI monsters whom the hero slashes with one mighty swing, this hero wrestles a man down and stabs him in the back of the neck with a broken sword, and you feel for both of them.This Robin isn't a robotic hero, and that's what bothers most viewers. The world he lives in is not black & white. The villains are not cartoony evil, but humans... all types of people we meet every day.The theme of the movie is eternal. This Robin is angry at the social inequality between the nobles and everyone else. He's not a dethroned prince, but a capable leader of the people, from the people. He suffers the injustice and acts against it. In recent movies, a hero is a superhuman who does everything effortlessly, he always has an edge over his enemies, and does everything without real motivation. The modern hero is just so good, he doesn't even need rewards like love or admiration. Basically, the modern hero is not a human being. It's an easy ideal to identify with. We all would just love to be perfect. It's not easy to come to terms with one's own shortcomings. That's why there are no movies like this anymore. The box office has proved that people like their egos being stroked, the maximum depth allowed is the family values theme. Everything else either flops ( or is a pretentious art-house flick about gay cowboys eating pudding ).

But there are some problems with this film.First off, what do you think of when you think of Sherwood Forest? Lush England? Oops...the movie was filmed in Spain, so it's rather arid.I know Robin has just come from years fighting in the Crusades, but did he have to look old and scruffy like one of the homeless men who lives under a local bridge? Couldn't Marian have at least trimmed his beard? So, Robin and Little John sneak into the village...looking exactly the same as they did before. And of course, they are immediately recognized by the Sheriff Of Nottingham. Gee, that was bright of them.Now, don't get me wrong. This movie is worth watching. The acting is quite good. You've got Sean Connery, who is very good as an over-the-hill Robin Hood, and Audrey Hepburn is very good as an over-the-hill Lady Marian. Robert Shaw is nastiness personified as the Sheriff of Nottingham. Nicol Williamson is good as Little John. Richard Harris -- only in the opening scenes -- is good as Richard the Lion-Heart. And Denholm Elliott is around as Will Scarlet...although he is so young I didn't recognize him.And the story is quite good...to a point (more about that shortly). Robin once again rescues Marian from the Sheriff Of Nottingham. And all the while they reminisce about the good old days.However. I must condemn this film. SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT ****** How would you feel if at the end of the new Superman film if Lois Lane committed suicide and murdered (of course by using Krptonite) Superman? Well, Robin Hood was an early hero, and the idea that the love of his life -- Marian -- would commit suicide and murder him is just too much for me to swallow.

What one would hope for in a Medieval tale, sweep and pomp and grandeur, is replaced by unhappiness and discontent. As presented, the film is also unbelievable and anticlimactic. Robin Hood (played in a straightforward manner by Sean Connery) is still battling the Sheriff of Nottingham, and he's loved again by Maid Marian, who has since become an abbess. Return to the screen of the incandescent Audrey Hepburn (absent since Wait Until Dark in 1967) is worth savoring, but Marian's apparent dark side--what is perceived and what is implied--is hardly appealing, and Hepburn's glow is incongruous with such matters. The film has bits of nostalgia which are hurried passed, and moments of sentiment undercut with dreary melodrama. The film is too long and draggy to be a classic, with brackish cinematography that isn't lyrical and a villain who is so tyrannical and lusting for blood that he's no fun. Robert Shaw plays the Sheriff in a vile-spewing manner, with death to all; he's well cast, and his final battle with Connery (his nemesis in From Russia with Love) is staged for a rousing effect, yet by this point the movie has pretty much imploded.

What the F? Anybody who's seen the film knows how reprehensible the ending is, how out of focus and how lacking in dramatic impetus it truly is. What I want to talk about is what a wasted opportunity we have here, because Lester's comedic talent is still very strong, and there's some really great moments in the film which really kind of add up to... what? A kind of self-serious betrayal.In generic terms, not much else to comment on. The action scenes are really awful, not bad in the terms of Richard Greene era Robin Hood, but I mean the movie starts off with a scene of a guy literally throwing an arrow into King Richard's (Richard Harris) neck, felling him with a blow as ridiculous as his presence in the film. Harris hams it up, Nicholson wishes he'd got the fun and short part, Connery doesn't seem to want to support the film... yet, it all works amazingly well, up till the last reel or so of the film.

Connery is an ageing Robin, returning to England from the crusades with all-weather companion Little John (Williamson) in toe, ready to re-kindle his romance with Marian (Hepburn) now living as a nun. Shaw co-stars as the Sheriff of Nottingham, not essentially concerned with Robin's return, but instructed to subdue his influence on the masses and avert the possibility of rebellion.Aside from the love story backdrop, I liked the camaraderie displayed between Connery and Shaw's characters, their mutual respect for one another and recognition of the limitations of their age, a refreshing take on their traditional rivalry. Their tense stand-off in the film's climax is an epic encounter as the two titans drag their middle-aged bodies into a bloody sword-fight to the death. Denholm Elliott, Kenneth Haigh and Ian Holm have supporting roles, as does funny-man Ronnie Barker in a rare dramatic film. Richard Harris' Richard the Lionheart is another great if brief performance serving to segway Robin's return to civilian life, a busted, weary old war-horse somewhat aimless without a battle to contest.Memorable score, occasional dry humour and some well choreographed fight sequences easily overcome any (at times) overly sentimental statements about love and loyalty that threaten to turn this man's picture into a chick flick. To be fair, it's probably well balanced in terms of romance and action and generally well done.

The usual Robin Hood story of King Richard being captured in Austria and Robin Hood fighting on behalf of the people of England has already come and gone. The film starts with Robin Hood fighting with King Richard in France. Already Robin and Marian shows that it is different from other Robin Hood stories, as King Richard is no longer the good king as per usual, but rather a bloody bastard as Robin calls him. Richard Harris is energetic in the role of Richard, and it is interesting to see a darker portrayal of the character.Sean Connery plays Robin Hood, now past his prime and trying to return to his old life. He is an appropriate choice for that role, and Audrey Hepburn is a good complement as a defiant and independent Marian. They are joined by a solid supporting cast of Merry Men Nicol Williamson (later Merlin in Excalibur (1981)) as Little John, Ronnie Barker as Friar Tuck and Denholm Elliott (later Marcus Brody in the Indiana Jones series) as Will Scarlett. The villain roster is also impressive, led by Robert Shaw as the Sheriff of Nottingham. Shaw is a seasoned sheriff made clever by years of battling Robin Hood in the past. He even criticizes the ineptitude of his guards, something any usual sheriff would never do. As a contrast to the sheriff, Kenneth Haigh plays Sir Ranulf, who represents the brash villain role usually played by the sheriff in other Robin Hood adaptations. Much humor comes from the clash between the sheriff's experience and Sir Ranulf's naivety. Ian Holm also has a brief but memorable cameo as King John.The film is also supported by excellent scenery, with some nice castles and a fitting score from John Barry. The story itself is mostly strong and develops the new relationship between Robin and Marian while drawing humor from the fact that Robin Hood is still trying to be an action hero in his older years. The only fatal part of the film is the lead up to the ending and especially the ending itself. The final conflict between Robin and the sheriff was decent and well-staged, but could have been better. The film writer opted for a Shakespearean ending to the film that I found inappropriate. The ending did not necessarily have to be a typical Robin Hood ending, but pretty much anything other than what they chose would have been better. Robin and Marian is a novel and interesting Robin Hood story, but watch out for the ending, it's a doozy.

There's seems to be too much jumping from one thing to another. First, there's a lot of talk, talk, talk at the beginning just before an attack on a castle, that was not seen because it was really bad and a lot of innocent women and children were killed. Then we see Robin finding Maid Marian as a nun (which is believable yet a little sexist as well), but she lets out a choice word every now and then. Nothing really nasty or like today's movies, but a nun saying these things, and Audrey too! Maybe it was trying to make them appear as real people with limitations. But, did it really advance the plot by having Audrey talk like that?!Getting back on track, there were moments between Sean and Audrey that may be considered romantic with a pretty backdrop like a river or a meadow. But, it's this back and forth between nature time with Audrey, and Sean fighting Robert Shaw and his men that make for a jarring viewing. Also, watching Sean Connery as an older Robin Hood fight near the end of the picture was a bit laughable, to say the least. Enough said!

You never really know how you are supposed to feel while you're watching awkward scenes like Robin Hood's last swordfight, and you sense that the filmmakers don't know why they included those awkward scenes, either. Connery and Hepburn are very good individually, but they don't click as a pair.

I love adventure movies and Sean Connery yet I was shocked the movie seemed so lifeless and unengaging. Part of this is due to the dreary and deadly serious plot--Robinhood returns after a very long absence to find that Maid Marian is old and you just can't go back. Talk about depressing! I bet Errol Flynn's Robinhood wouldn't have behaved that way--he would have swept Marian off her feet and gone on 1001 NEW adventures. Well if that's what you are looking for, find another movie. No, this one's just dreary and ultimately culminates in Marian killing herself and Robin. Huh?! Did they REALLY need to go THERE with the plot? "},{"Title":"Robin and Marian","Date":"5 September 2008","Score":"0 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Romance","Review":" I knew a little about this film from the leading actor playing the well known stealing-from-rich, giving-to-poor hero, but that is pretty much all I knew about it, from director Richard Lester (A Hard Day's Night). Basically this is set 20 years after most other versions of the story, Robin Hood (Sir Sean Connery) and all other merry men, including Little John (The Wind in the Willows' Nicol Williamson), Will Scarlett (Denholm Elliott ) and Friar Tuck (Ronnie Barker) are ageing, and have returned from the Crusades. Robin is told that Maid Marian (Audrey Hepburn) is now living in the near nunnery, and when they reunite she has mixed feelings, but they become lovers once again after Robin rescues her from old enemy the Sheriff of Nottingham (Robert Shaw). The ending is a little confusing when Marian decides to poison Robin and herself to die together, but I suppose it had to end that kind of way, in each other's arms. Also starring Richard Harris as King Richard, Kenneth Haigh as Sir Ranulf, Sir Ian Holm as King John, Bill Maynard as Mercadier and Carry On's Peter Butterworth as Surgeon. I can't remember there being a lot of battle sequences, and I think the love story is a little more poignant, but it is a good film, as far as I can remember. Good!

They ought to start their point of reference with the 1938 classic starring Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, Basil Rathbone and Claude Rains instead, because that is the definitive version of the Robin Hood legend and this film in no way is a fitting sequel to that sort of storytelling.Instead of calling itself ROBIN AND MARIAN, deceptively luring lovers of the old legend to see the film, it should have been titled something more appropriately dealing with two bittersweet, faded lovers who bear no resemblance to the legendary outlaw and his lady love. Having Miss Hepburn appear in nun's robes is another huge mistake.Neither star is shown at their charismatic best. Nor does the presence of Robert Shaw or Richard Harris make up for the weary script.As a matter of fact, this is one of the few films of the 1970s that I actually walked out on. I did not stay for the downbeat ending which I understand has Miss Hepburn killing the outlaw herself. No way. Goldman's script is heavy, lumbering stuff, hard to even stay awake for.Two thumbs down.
