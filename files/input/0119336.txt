Get a dialog driven play, get the playwright to pen it for the screen, and toss in two of the most intense and talented actors (Kevin Spacey and Sean Penn) in the business, supported by a very talented and surprising cast.  What do you get? Hurlyburly!  Billed as a black comedy, this is more what I would term black hole comedy.  It is VERY dark, very disturbing, and the humor comes from the characters' need to lighten up a moment or to justify their actions. This film is NOT for everyone...  If you're looking for anything truly humorous, this isn't the film.  But if you want to see amazing acting and professionals who work well together, this is your film.  Read other reviews with cautions on this film--don't confuse the tone of someone who hates what the characters stand for, what they believe in, and how they behave with the quality of the work done by the entire cast.

Besides an exceptional cast, the dialogue is sharp and witty and there are some very intriguing issues raised.  However, it seems that these positive points are lost on most viewers.  My guess is it's because you cannot remain a passive viewer or an idiot and expect to find any redeeming qualities in this movie.  On the surface, Hurlyburly is populated by extremely unsympathetic characters that become more debased as the movie progresses.  Eddie (Penn) provides the central thrust of the movie.  Eddie is also almost continually snorting coke that fuels extended often seemingly disjointed dialogue.  But most of the meaning is lost and the movie can become a bit tedious if you take this dialogue literally.  The drugs and depravity serve to create a plausible environment for the expression of a much greater range of thoughts and emotions.  It would be hard to swallow Eddie's neurosis and paranoia if he wasn't high all the time.  And, Eddie's drug addled observations and frustrations are the glue of the movie.  The drugs provide the writer with a device to verbalise many thoughts that normally would not be uttered aloud. More traditionally this type of problem might be solved by using a narrator. Eddie's problems and fears are not all that different from most people ... they are just extremely amplified.

Heavy drug use, discomfiting sexual situations, bad language, violence, a talky, stagey atmosphere, and generally despicable characters. Even if you like the actors involved, this may still not be the movie for you (my aunt rented it for my uncle and herself on the strength of Kevin Spacey's name, and he still hasn't forgiven her).Having said that, I really liked this movie. I never saw the play, but when I read through it, I thought it was the most misogynistic piece of garbage I had ever  encountered. Seeing it on screen, though, was a completely different experience. I felt that I understood what the playwright was trying to get at namely, that this is a piece about how Eddie, through the death of Phil, is saved from being Mickey. In short, a spiritual redemption of sorts.Performances are uniformly strong. I have never been a big Sean Penn fan, but I thought he did a more than competent job with Eddie, particularly in the later scenes where he veers between arrogance and pathos. Kevin Spacey seemed uncomfortable with some aspects of the dialogue (i.e. blah blah blah etc.), but otherwise did his usual masterful job, in a role which raises the same questions that many of us would like to ask of him.The  role of Donna was, I felt, disfigured by the many cuts in the script--she is more of a victim than a wanton, IMHO--thus, the best thing I can say about Anna Paquin's performance is that she did well with what she was given. I had no strong objections to any of the other casting choices, except for Meg Ryan as Bonnie, who apparently cannot even play a stripper without resorting to her usual cutesy mannerisms.FWIW, I liked the director's technical choice of opening the scenes by putting the conversations on cell phones, etc. However, I would have willingly sacrificed some of the added dialogue for some of the original lines that got cut.

The film is frequently referred to as a comedy-drama, a misleading designation for what is a sometimes humorous, but ultimately emotional and sobering look at life in 1980s Hollywood.  Particularly well-done are the cocaine-fuelled scenes which provide one of the most accurate depictions of the drug lifestyle and the effect it can have on interpersonal relationships.  The film can seem over-the-top in parts, but the excess is necessary to convey the film's message.  Emotional, witty, thought-provoking and on some levels deeply depressing, Hurlyburly is an underrated and under-appreciated character-driven drama that capitalizes on the talents of an all-star cast to deliver a top-notch product.

The movie deals in archetypes, with nearly all the characters neatly sitting into one archetype or another. After watching the movie one cant help wonder which of the people he knows is like which of the characters in the movie.The direction and cinematography are used to serve the characters, and thats what the movie is about, the characters. Nothing much happens in the movie, other than people meeting, and people talking. I always find brutally honest characters interesting to watch, and this entire movie might just be about that. The cast, and the acting is excellent.Many people are bored by the movie because of its wordiness, and many people disparage it as a drug movie. Although the film is wordy, it is not a drug movie. I would say it is a philosophical movie if anything else. The movie forces you to be introspective, and the movie even acts like somewhat of a Rorschach test on the viewers. Some scenes, like the one where Eddie and Mickey describe the road trip, can be seen in different ways. I like to think that the way people understand this movie has a lot to do with the kind of people they are.Do watch this movie, but remember that the movie is demanding. The characters talk fast, and talk a lot. The ideas expressed are complicated, and need to be thought about to be properly understood. In fact, watch this movie twice.

They remain with you as memorable experiences, be they like Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, Gandhi, or The Maltese Falcon. The genre hardly matters; good screen play is an essential in even the action movie. Too bad so much mediocre screen writing abounds when good talent seems so obtainable.'Hurlyburly' was adapted from the play for the screen by the author. In a word, it is brilliant. The acting is superb in every character, and the casting was perfect. Once again, Sean Penn gives a performance that is indicative of his paramount position as one of the very best actors of his generation &#151; a superlative star given any generation.I can just imagine that this film has made some pretty bad friends in some quarters &#151; and in both genders. There is no hiding the fact that this sort of world exists to some extent anywhere a group of hedonistic, single males (or men who think that they are still single) gather to hang out, relax or party. But a viewer will be missing the point if she/he thinks that 's all there is &#151; gratuitous, reckless living. Marshall McLuan's theory of amputation kept occurring to me after watching the film &#151; the idea that with each additional machine in our culture we are being cut off from our humanity. This is a psychodrama that does not resort to the unspoken, latent trauma that lurks in the past to trouble our characters. Something in Eddie is more truncated than broken, and although he doesn't know what it is, he is intensely aware that it is causing him despair, loneliness and pain. The drugs maybe both cause and effect. Beyond the pain itself, he is completely unsure about what he thinks he is supposed to feel. Some considerable irony floats around this issue, and to the director's credit it is revealed with cunning grace.This film demonstrates that amidst all the lowest common denominating crud, American mainstream cinema is occasionally distributing intriguing works of art. This may not be the film to purposely chose on a sad evening of angst and regret, but if you were to catch it at such a moment, the performances might sweep you up, and the film that was a play could beguile you. I gave it an unequivocal 10 for the same reasons your movie guide gives 5's for the films that I would love to have in my tape and disk library. "}{"Title":"Hurlyburly","Date":"11 December 2009","Score":"6 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" Hurlyburly is adapted from a 1984 play by David Rabe, which is undoubtedly one of the best I have read. The stage version of the piece runs for over three hours and the entire show takes place in one location. Its life on stage has been both controversial and acclaimed. Anthony Drazan's film is brisker then the play, at a length of 122 minutes, and it is set in a variety of different places.The film takes place in Hollywood, although Rabe argues that critics overemphasize its setting. It explores the dynamics and cyclical psychology of men, and the women who pass through their lives. The characters interact in a chaotic environment, but it is their mental lack of clarity that provides focus for the piece. Substance abuse is an important component of the film, since it enhances the nature of the dialogue.Eddie (played by Sean Penn) can be considered the protagonist of the piece, but he doesn't serve as a spokesman for the themes. Nor does he exist as a moral compass for the story, which fluctuates between brutal animosity and moments of genuine tenderness. As Eddie says in the film, he is trying to maintain a viable relationship with reality. The tumultuous feelings and ideas he has are disconnected and elusive. Throughout the course of the movie, he comes to realize that he is a spectator of his own turbulent existence, and his paranoia intensifies.In order to maintain some sense of personal control, Eddie reflects his own uncontrollable tendencies in his best friend Phil (Chazz Palminteri). Phil is a wild force full of violence and rage, and his vulnerability makes him more dangerous. Eddie feels that if he keeps Phil on a leash, he is somehow restraining his own tumultuous urges. This kind of indirect, cerebrally confused relationship is what lies at the core of Hurlyburly. Without some kind of analysis, the men in this film are simply drug-addled misogynists complaining about existence.Mickey (Kevin Spacey) is a friend of Eddie's and Phil's, but he is more superficially balanced than both of them combined. Mickey delivers casual, sarcastic assaults to Phil as a way of validating his own sense of worth and importance. He confirms his own masculinity through emotionless sex and the humiliation of visibly weak people. Although Mickey is not inclined to raise his voice or inflict physical harm on people, he is arguably one of the cruelest characters in the play.All of these men see women as a vindictive, malevolent presence in their lives, and their romantic insecurity can probably be related to issues with control. Particularly in the case of Phil and Eddie, these characters want to dominate the women they interact with, and they feel threatened when they are unable to do so. They still cling to the idea that they can own something in every sense. What they are attempting is to remedy their lack of personal understanding through controlling women.Of course, all of these ideas are my personal interpretations of the material, but I admire any piece of writing that welcomes this kind of involvement. David Rabe's Hurlyburly is not simply a commentary on the inner-workings of Hollywood, although that may play a small role. It is one of the most intimate, challenging portrayals of men I have seen. The people occupying this story are not the sort of people you would necessarily want to befriend, but that doesn't make them unworthy of examination.In a 1999 interview with Charlie Rose, Sean Penn said that he is interested in films that are expressive instead of impressive. Anthony Drazan's treatment of Hurlyburly is completely expressive, and its articulation deserves to be commended. Technically speaking, it's a very well-made film, with dizzying visual style and exhilarating structure.Any work like this is obviously reliant on the actors, and Hurlyburly makes no missteps in regards to casting. Sean Penn is one of the great American actors, and I believe that this is one of his finest achievements. He played Eddie on stage before taking part in this screen treatment, and his personal understanding of the character is visible. This is a complete performance in every sense, drawing us in with broad physical alterations while also demonstrating the importance of subtlety.As an actor, Kevin Spacey is on par with Penn, and his knowledge of the craft is evident again in this film. He also performed this part onstage in the past, and he illustrates an intuition for the style of dialogue and acting required. Chazz Palminteri is outstanding as Phil, providing us with an intimate and painfully honest portrait. All the other actors deserve mention as well &#x96; Robin Wright Penn, Garry Shandling, Anna Paquin and Meg Ryan all turn in convincing and memorable performances.Hurlyburly asks us to spend time with flawed and occasionally despicable characters, but ignoring it on that basis is frankly closed-minded. This piece asks us to study why these people behave the way they do, and it presents us with great writing and acting to make that experience engaging. I think this is one of the best American movies of the 1990s, and it is a personal favorite.

His role in Hurlyburly is far more impressive than the Jersey-speaking gangster in Great Clint's emotional waterfall of a film. I've always been a fan of Hurlyburly since seeing a heavily edited version of it for the first time on UPN years ago, mainly for its writing and acting performances. The entire ensemble is wonderful - Penn, Spacey, and Palminteri especially - and the writing is believable and clear cut, even though I've never met or been exposed to anyone even close to characters like the ones depicted in the film. The low rating on IMDb surprised me, but maybe I can see why the majority of people either don't like or are rather indifferent about the film. The film-making is not ground breaking by any means, but the content and passion exuded from the actors involved stand out amongst other films like it that heavily rely on idiosyncratic and interesting dialogue. I'd like to see Rabe's stage version to see how he nails it - because the movie is a treat for anyone who enjoys a dose of something a bit off-beat and different.

I have rarely, or perhaps even never, seen a movie with such extreme verbal acrobatics and with such an incredible emphasis on complex semantic games and duels; almost makes Stillman's movies sound like Bud Spencer's films, by comparison. Whoever wrote this thing evidently put a lot of effort into the sometimes mind-boggling dialog. There isn't much in the way of a plot, but the kind of talking, arguing, and philosophizing that goes on here is rather unusual. And the good part is that it's very well-written. Occasionally the sentences or arguments get so bogged down into semantic mud that it becomes necessary to use the rewind button, because it's difficult to concentrate that hard for two entire hours. I think that Wright spoke for both the viewers and the cast members when she at one point hollered I can't stand this semantic insanity any more!.Practically everyone engages in the verbal entanglements, but it is Penn's character who usually outdoes everyone in this respect, and it is usually him who initiates them, right after snorting the n-th line of cocaine, or after having taken a couple of deep inhalings of hash - and those things he does throughout the whole movie (and this goes to a lesser extent for Spacey and Schandling, too). The semantic insanity sometimes goes so far that the characters replace ends of sentences with blablablabla - quite literally. The dialog is sometimes fascinating, often funny or amusing, and at times so insanely intricate that the characters themselves have trouble following what the other person exactly meant to say.This last thing, of course, leads to many amusing moments. The humorous moments themselves stem primarily from Penn's drug-induced, hallucinatory ramblings and Spacey's wonderful sarcasm and wit. In fact, the very beginning of the movie sets the tone for the way those two will interact throughout most of the picture (their relationship being important but also just one of a half-dozen) Penn is falling deeper and deeper into thickets of semantic insanity - bitching about Spacey having had a fling with Wright - while Spacey listens to him, and responds to Penn's verbal overkill by making wry remarks. In the two hours of the movie Penn is almost always whacked-out on drugs, and the more drugged he is, the more he searches for answers to the meaning of life (towards the end of the movie), the more he moans, bitches, and whines, and the more he practices his bored-out-of-my-mind philosophizing about relationships and life. In moments when he is extremely out of it - like when alone with Meg Ryan, and just after Palmintierri's funeral - he goes on such an emotional rampage, and his voice assumes such a high, crackly pitch that he sounds exactly like Bill Murray in moments when he goes a little crazy. It's by far the best Penn I've seen so far; he has rarely been good, but in this movie he is rather good, I have to admit. Spacey, of course, is great as ever, and Palmintierri gets a short while to get used to. The cast is, generally speaking, quite a colourful and mixed bag.There are a number of funny or amusing moments, so I'll just mention a couple of those that I still remember... There is the scene when Penn mentions the aborigines, and says some nonsense about them having (had) their own problems, such as tigers waiting in trees, and dogs in the bushes (or something like that). Very funny. Then there is a funny, longer scene in which Spacey tries to explain to Penn that there is no hidden message in Palmintierri's (rather moronic) suicide note, while Penn insists that they analyze the letter for hidden meanings and anagrams(!) in order to find the real truth about his pal's death. Especially funny is the brief scene when Spacey reads the letter aloud, mock-analyzing it word by word.

Here, there's not one but seven self indulgent, self obsessed losers who seem to exist solely to force their neuroses on other people. Eddie and Mickey are casting agents who live together in the Hollywood Hills. Their 'friends' are Phil, a cocaine addled actor, and Arnie, an obsequious producer. There's also Darlene, sometimes Eddie's girlfriend, sometimes, Mickey's; Donna, a hitch hiker; and Bonnie, a single parent stripper. During the course of the film they drink, get stoned, go to a funeral, oh, and talk at interminable length about, well, nothing. Mickey's opening gambit is - 'So, Phil, your personal life's a shambles, how's your career?' and that pretty much sets the tone for the rest of the movie. The characters are so unpleasant, so self obsessed, it's hilarious. The constant repetition of motifs - alcohol, drugs, profanity, sex, paranoia, and morbid introspection, goes beyond exploitation of those things, and paints a very black picture of the male psyche. Few actors are prepared to appear as repellent on screen as Sean Penn is,and he's never been as repellent as he is in this. Chazz Palminteri, as Phil, is frighteningly moronic. 'I could kick your eyes out and feel nothing' he says to Kevin  Spacey's Mickey. Spacey has one electric moment of acting, when he breaks down in tears in the middle of a dirty story. Apart from that, his familiar mannerisms are ideally suited to the souless character he's playing. The film's best moment? Eddie What would it take to make you mad Mickey? Mickey Hey, I guess anythings possible.

Well, end credits revealed me that Hurlyburly was originally a play after all and it's really not hard to believe it. Mostly every scene takes place in this one building and the ingenious screenplay is so full of amazingly enjoyable dialogue we hardly find it in a so-called traditional drama.Of course the acting made the experience festive. Sean Penn and Kevin Spacey in the leading roles were phenomenal as usual. Robin Wright Penn and Meg Ryan played the female parts splendidly. Funny thing is, I didn't even recognize Chazz Palminteri! I mean really, I watched A Bronx tale just recently but he simply looked so different in this one. Somehow...chubbier. How much can a bloke change in five years time?Well if we want to talk about a true transformation just take a good look at Anna Paquin. This was the little 11 year old girl who's debut role of Flora McGrath in Jane Campion's The Piano was awarded with an Oscar. Like I said, five years can really change someone. She was absolutely sensational in Hurlyburly, beautiful, sexy and downright irresistible. Hurlyburly is extremely clever, stylish and entertaining black comedy for people with a good taste for dramas. If Shakespeare would be alive today and he would create a modern play I guess the man would probably come up with something like this. To put it in one word wonderful!

He is a man lost in a world where everything is a cliche and even communication itself seems redundant (eg. the blah blah blah's inserted at the end of Penn's and Spacey's sentences).Nothing seems real in this stifling, sincerity free environment (a situation not helped by the mountains of cocaine he imbibes throughout the story).Penn's character flounders through the film clinging to doomed love affairs and deceitful pseudo friendships in an attempt to remind himself that he is still a human being and not just some robotic consumer unit.In that sense 'Hurly Burly' is more existentialist angst than moral fable or media satire and is all the more refreshing for that. Spacey is magnificent as Penn's charming but ultimately soulless flatmate and Chazz Palminteri gives a splendidly unhinged performance as Penn's aspiring actor client.Although Davids Rabe's screen adaption of his play can often look exactly that the dialogue brims over with dark sardonic wit and there are some truly hysterically funny scenes that so accurately capture the derangement of drug psychosis it is almost painful to watch.Ultimately though the film's melancholy tone takes precedence and in the final analysis one almost feels ashamed for having laughed at all.

It is all in the dialogue rather than action; interaction between two or three characters only most of the time, sudden changes of mood and dynamics, more cerebral than visceral. It is more expansive than a stage play though, even though it has that feel about it. The screenplay includes nice cinematic touches like the car phone dialogues where one car over takes the other and he shouts at him as he goes past. A similar thing was done from the balcony of the flat earlier in the film. There are also some qualities of a Michael Mann about it with the use of architecture and music as film elements.The film grew on me as it went along. One of the things that made it difficult perhaps, was that none of the characters were very likable, but the acting by all of them was a tour de force. Nice to see Meg Ryan given a chance to do some real acting instead of being just pretty-pretty set decoration. It's a film that is hard to take in one sitting I think, and will bear repeated viewing with more coming out each time.This film is likely to appeal to people who liked such films as Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Glengarry Glen Ross, Le Diner de Cons and others which have a stage play feel about them.

Where the film falls apart is in the casting of two crucial roles, Chaz Palminteri as Phil and Kevin Spacey as Mickey. Palminteri doesn't seem a natural with Rabe's dialogue, I am constantly aware that he's acting; the same can be said about Spacey, he brings the same schtick that he always drags out, the emotionally cold and creepy guy. Someone like Christopher Walken would have really been fantastic and believable in the part. There are some nice directorial touches of opening the play out and making it more cinematic, but not enough. This is a dialogue heavy piece, which I love, but too often for the medium we have to sit through scenes where we're told about events and not shown them - for instance the vibrator incident, this is mildly interesting hearing about it, but it could have been more revealing and hysterically funny showing us the incident!

But the thing is, most of these guys, with some exceptions in scenes, they're without redeeming characteristics. The film might be a fine anti-Cocaine ad, to be sure, as there's barely a scene where someone isn't snuffing up the nose (it was filmed in 1998 but written back in the early 80's, which makes just a little more sense), but as far as giving any thing close to a (bleep) about these guys is tough. And I know that's not the main goal, I know it's not. We're meant to wallow in with these men who have all of this time to luxuriate in bulls*** and do their drugs and screw around with girls like Anna Paquin (who, I did like, is never identified by age making it all the more questionable), and how they are at best misogynistic and at worst... well, SVU handles guys like these sometimes pretty well.Perhaps the intention in David Rabe's script, and certainly I could see it being that for the stage where it was originally done, is that they're in a nihilistic circle of their own making, filled with drug- laden anecdotes and partying and screwing around and all that stuff that Hollywood people do (and hey, it's the world by Mulholland drive so it's that kind of terrain), and they're just trying to get by each their own way. But it's how characters speak that becomes uneven. Sean Penn's Eddie is a paranoid mess who is fine for a few minutes when we see him clean and sober, and then right back to being a dick as soon as he's back on the powder. Kevin Spacey's Nicky seems more cool-headed and rational, but is so vindictive that, perhaps comparatively, comes off best but among the real world still fails at humanity (maybe by default). And Phil, that's a whole other ball of wax, a man so neurotic he makes Woody Allen characters look like the Beaver Cleavers.The women are a little more of a mixed lot, with Darlene (Robin Wright Penn, not too oddly enough Sean's wife) the most sane and clear-headed and rational. It's mostly in Hurlyburly a question of being so thick into the muck of decay that it just becomes self-indulgent. And the way characters speak tends to go on and on, mostly with a guy like Phil who just has too many words up his sleeve for someone who should have more of an instinctual, guttural way of talking like a primitive beast. It's not the talk of movie people but theater, and that's one of the big slip ups here, and not an uncommon one with adaptations which is to not have the right tone for the screen. Sometimes the dialog can be agreeable, maybe close to funny (the scene where Phil throws Meg Ryan's character out of the car, and what leads up to it, is amazing). But too much of it is over-loaded with language.The acting should be what saves it. Sometimes it does. I mean, look who is over here after all, Oscar winners and other notables. But when Garry Shandling ends up really taking the acting prize (and most notably with a scene where he talks with Penn through a glass table) you know there's something not quite right. Spacey is fine but he could do this part in his sleep; more curious would've been to see Christopher Walken, who originated the role on Broadway, in the role as it would've been so unusual for him. Penn has his moments where he connects emotionally, but the rest of it is in such predictable ham-bone mode that it becomes laughable; most excruciating is a scene where he keeps begging Meg Ryan for a BJ, and it gets to a point where Tommy Wiseau would be needed as a dramatic stand-in. You're tearing me apart, movie!Palminteri seems the most mis-cast though; I never really believed much of what he was saying, and only once or twice did it look like he was even slightly well-off in the role. He keeps on making these things with how he speaks (though it might be akin to how Phil talks) and it's just odd and embarrassing, considering that the man can act in the right role, usually in urban street-wise stuff. A neurotic is not for him, and he has to play one to such a psychotic extent and looks a little dumbfounded in some scenes why he's even there! And it's not all on the director's fault, at least, maybe, I wouldn't think so entirely. He does keep some scenes moving along to try and bring some cinematic quality to it. But when it stalls into its theater-setting, it shows. I don't want to be too hard on the movie, and yet it's tough when there's such high stakes a dynamite cast, a drug-fueled set-up that allows for so much potential drama. The results should be fantastic. And instead it's the kind of hot-headed pretentious bally-hoo that makes people hate Hollywood people they're heads are so far up their asses they don't know where the sun shines anymore.

I'm not sure; i was very impressed. The character was just on.  He made the wordiness of his character work; he runs the gambit from being a manic, totally slammed on cocaine--to a defeated, sober man, stripped to his very humblest.Robin Wright Penn is beautiful and effortless in her performance.  The nuances of her character (the constant tucking of the hair behind her ear, the nervous hand movements, avoidance to make eye contact) made all the difference; she plays a great insecure, preoccupied, and indecisive woman.The rest were good, but I can't tell if it's because the leads were so good, or that they couldn't breathe the same kind of life into the script.  Anna Pacquin was not at all comfortable with her lines.  The looks are there, but not the acting--and I've seen her act.  She just doesn't seem comfortable with the words.A generally insightful movie, with clear roots to the stage.  I felt I really had to get over my dislike of some of the characters, as well as the structure of the movie.  Structure meaning that it doesn't exactly seem to follow the same kind of formula cinema usually follows.I'm always moved more by the things I feel I can go back and mine for more insight and thought distillation.  I know I didn't get all there was to get out of this movie having seen it only once.  And that's a comforting thought.  Had it been superficial and heavy-handed, the acting would've been for naught.

They take way too much coke and have the most delirious but at the same time most profound conversation making the film both interesting and hilarious. It's like Hollywood Through the looking Glass.  Tough this film is based around dialogue it does not lack in pace due to an incredible script and magnificent acting.  However this film is not for everyone.  If you planned to switch your brain off go and get Rambo out.  The dialogue is sometimes a bit confusing, which is not much surprise when you think that the characters are on drugs and pretty much confused otherwise.  Sean Penn's acting is incredible.  He is at the centre of the play and portrays Eddie, a paranoid and confused man who has obviously no idea what he is talking about.  His house-mate played by Spacey reeks patience and sarcasm without limits. His best friend, played by Chazz is a short-tempered man obsessed by destiny with a convincing pseudo-logic!  Don't worry this film is not too intellectual it just requires a bit of concentration on the dialogues, but trust me it's worth the ballad.

Preposterous?  Overdone? Yeah, but this adaptation of David Rabe's wordy play has secret weapons Penn, Spacey, and Palminteri, each full of a different acid.  Penn, in particular, often looks only seconds short of brainfry, and it is casting genius to put him alongside the supremely easy-going monster Spacey.Hurlyburly is a smarter exploration of the loss of self than Leaving Las Vegas, mainly because its characters are imbued with 10,000-watt tongues (everybody, from producers to teenagers and strippers, riffs triumphantly in arch, knowing prose, so that when Penn's character resorts at one point to a dictionary to look up the word accident, we get an unintentional har-har). But like Leaving Las Vegas, it also tests your patience by immediately presenting inner decay so advanced that there is nothing, thematically or plotwise, that can take the exploration further after its first forty-five minutes.  There is no character development, only attitudinal recycling, restatements of cynicism, perpetual wallowing.  There is little to say about the women in the cast (including Penn's wife, Robin Wright); their roles are mainly props.  Menace hangs over several scenes, supplied by Palminteri's presence as an ex-con turned failed actor and even worse metaphysician (he must have had access to Sartre in the slammer), but we get so many assurances of impending doom that when it comes, there is no dramatic weight.  Much better at this kind of thing are Neil LaBute's films (Your Friends and Neighbors, In the Company of Men), which manage to cover this psychic and moral territory with pacing, surprise, and event -- and more believable language.As an adaptation, Hurlyburly can do little more than sprinkle in a few locations in order to try to breathe visual life into its vast plains of dialogue.  (It's telling that the most affecting moment is a 5-minute long recollection by the characters of an awful event in the past, related while they stand around in the dining room.)  There are some peaks, but there seem to be many more low-lying depressions, stuff that sounds so thick and writerly we can't believe it springs from the mouths of human beings, and to break up this stagnant air the characters suddenly...move outside the house onto the terrace!  Yes, the character study here is powerfully claustrophobic, the acting very good.  But repetition makes these 122 minutes feel a lot longer than they should be.

My favorite line has to be from the Anna Paquin character Donna, who basically makes a great point by saying It's great when people know what each other are talking about  That's all the characters do, talk talk talk, etc. While the characters are basically the most despicable bunch of people you would never want to be in a room with, at least the actors playing the parts are superb. Sean Penn is great as Eddie--he doesn't go too far over the top. Kevin Spacey, despite an awful hair style, steals scenes as the sarcastic Mickey; Chazz Palminteri is suitably dull and rough as Phil; Garry Shandling basically plays himself; Meg Ryan tries to break away from her typical performance with her role as a stripper, but comes off as the least credible of the cast; and, Anna Paquin in a shockingly different role as the teen runaway Donna, willing to trade her body for a place to stay.

The coke induced introspective chit chat is at times plain hilarious. The acting is Oscar worthy while Penn's and Spacey's acting powerhouses are awesome as always, Palminteri, in a part very much unlike the usual cocky Italian mobsters he is often typecasted in, gives a memorable performance as a suicidal manic depressive victim of the insanity that the vitriol mix of Hollywood and coke is famous for. The story is pretty thin, in terms of events creating a story arc, but I have seldom seen shallowness depicted so strikingly dead on the mark. The message of it seems to be that you can never hide from being human after all, especially not if you are covered in all the coke and money in the world, and once you come out of hiding, you may not like what you see in the mirror, and then it may be too late.

Darlene is by turns endearingly flighty and ruthlessly self-centered.  Yet all of them live and breathe in front of you. Even if you've never met someone like Eddie, you know he's out there. They're all out there.  With any luck, they don't hang out together.Okay, so it's dialogue driven.  Stop whining, already.  Just enjoy the beautiful language.  It's easy to craft a detailed character through action.. Try doing it through words.  Then, throw in deliberate as well as unconscious self- and other-deception.  If, after all that, your characters are still clear and true, you are as strong a writer as David Rabe.Three acts, clearly visible in the film.  The first is, as first acts generally are, mainly to set-up the characters, their relationships, etc. It's also very funny (the cell phone scene, just to name the most obvious). More important than establishing the characters, which is done remarkably quickly, this act establishes the tone of the piece.  You know what these people's lives are about.  Everything that happens later in the film, as impossible as it is to predict, and every background detail that is added along the way, slips snugly into the framework as initially established.The second act is the funniest.  It's one year later, and not much has changed.  This fact alone is rather disturbing.  As manipulative and coldly backstabbing as Mickey is, Eddie is still living with him in some sort of (adequate) friendship.  What does that tell you?  This act also introduces the biggest surprise of the film... Meg Ryan.  I never knew she was an actress.  Well, learn something new every day.  The dramatic arc of this act is a wonder to behold.  It's all one sequence, with no significant temporal gaps at all.  It's all dialogue, without even the frenetic scene changes of act one to provide the illusion of forward moving action.  And it's brilliant.  Act two, as vital as it is to the overall development of the film as a whole, could stand magnificently on its own.  Act three takes these lives, these strained relationships, and attacks them with a crow bar, smashing them apart.  Phil's death, the initial catalyst of the final collapse.  Eddie's ultimate break-down.  The return of Donna from act one, far wiser, in a way, but no less lost than Eddie when you get right down to it.Does Eddie learn in the end that he underappreciated his true friends Phil and Artie?  He thinks he does, but he doesn't.  The tragedy of this film is not the senseless death of Phil, it's the senseless life of Eddie.Throughout the whole film he's barely staying afloat, not making progress but not quite going under.  He goes under (literally), is rescued (miraculously), and is returned to his point of departure.  What happens one year later when he sinks again?

I almost didn't care who it was, but someone in this movie needed to be dead. Preferably all of them.Not that the movie ever pretends that any of its characters are likable in any way it revels in sexism and depravity.But I wanted someone to die just to shake them up, to shake the movie up. Can we have something close to a real interaction here, I silently begged, something not fueled by drugs and/or pseudo-intellectual one-upsmanship?What I saw as the major flaw of the movie will be its saving grace to many people the flashy writing. Any one of the vastly different characters could deliver any of the lines - they're like puppets, flapping their jaws as the writer/puppetmaster speaks for them. For any degree of believability, the writer needs to stay firmly behind the curtain - and Hurlyburly's writer will not.Kevin Spacey manages to lend reality to his character, in spite of the writing; Sean Penn has the same effect, but with less consistency. In fact, the performances here are pretty good - they're just hamstrung by the disconnect between what they're trying to portray and what's coming out of their mouths. Other than that, Meg Ryan is simply way too adorable for her role, though she valiantly attempts a degree of scraggle, aided by unwashed hair and smeary makeup.There are some moments when the actors rise above the material, including a wonderful fight between Eddie and Darlene (played by Sean and Robin Wright Penn) that progresses from car to side of road back into the car.

Why? Because not only is Penn an amazing actor, but the films he's in are always a little- to way- unexpected, and Hurlyburly is no exception. Penn is the coke-snorting (Scarface would be proud), 8 a.m. joint-smoking, cigarette-inhaling, twitching, emotionally wrecked nucleus of the story. Kevin Spacey, Gary Shandling, and Chazz Palminteri are the equally, yet uniquely differently, damaged electrons in shaky orbit around him. The glue that holds the whole atom together is mutual self-loathing, and the morbid desire to wonder what happens to the drowning man after he goes down for the third time.The film is very talky (don't forget it's based on David Rabe's play) but the dialog always manages to come back to something anybody (read you or me) might say if sufficiently coked up, on Valium, and on their third joint. The whole cast is excellent, especially Penn and Shandling, and watching Meg Ryan looking fried out, smoking a reefer, is always good for a kick (she's good, too). My two complaints were Kevin Spacey (who I think might be one of the more overrated actors) who goes through the film being ironic and detached (big stretch), and Palminteri who manages to play yet another thug (big surprise there), although neither is there to do more than support Penn's coke-addled rantings.If you like to watch films about sleazy, damaged people on the shadowed edges of Hollywood, 'Hurlyburly' is for you. And while you're at it, grab John Schlesinger's 'Day of the Locust' with Donald Sutherland as wiggy Homer Simpson (yep! this baby came out in 1975) and Karen Black, that paints an even more dismal picture of what Hollywood can do  to the less than successful.

Anna Paquin was wonderful and if you close your eyes, Kevin Spacey's character might as well have been played by Steve Martin. Chazz Palmitieri was an interesting casting choice.

It's surprising to me a studio head would even give the go ahead to such a pointless, inane drama and how they roped in such expensive and usually circumspect performers. It's kind of a middle aged buddy movie, but what exactly motivates or keeps these characters in a permanent adolescence is left a mystery. Penn's character runs on a cocaine, has group sex with a 16 year old girl, strings along his girlfriend, unable to make a commitment.. and blathers and obsesses about not 'loving' himself.. well.. come on bud.. what's to love.

Of course, these are philosophies spewed by people who are almost always on cocaine or 'weed.'  The direction of the movie is quite inventive, lots of camera angles are very artistic and worth seeing.  The acting is also quite good, especially by Kevin Spacey in the sort of sarcastic, deadpan role that he does so well.  Sean Penn got on my nerves after a while, but I admit he did play the role well.  The final scene between him and Mickey (Kevin Spacey) is pure genius and worth watching a couple times.  Meg Ryan is also noteworthy as a druggie stripper (not exactly You've Got Mail).  Overall, the movie is too long, and the dialogue can get VERY tiring.  Oh, and Anna Paquin cannot act.

But subjectivity is objective when you consider the irrationality of the rational. Or some mumbo- jumbo. In Allen's film, it is amusing. In Hurly Burly, however, it is nothing but strange. I don't know where these characters supposedly went to school, but they speak to each other like I would expect Harvard psychology professors to speak, rather than a bunch of friends in the entertainment business. Not to say that the film was not interesting. I was fascinated by what these people were trying to say. It's just that most of it was garbled, elegantly presented garbage, and that ultimately, nothing was solved. On the other hand, the acting was superb. Sean Penn, while still slightly over-the-top, was excellent, Kevin Spacey was as dry and as brilliant as I've seen him, and the rest of the cast performed solidly. The one exception to this was the disappointing Anna Paquin, who came off as rather bland in her minor role. Though I do appreciate much of what the film tried to convey (the world is in shambles, people are terrible to each other, drugs don't help, etc.) I was confused as to how the film- makers expected to handle all of these issues satisfactorily.

I'm sure there are people like this in Hollywood--drug-crazed, sexual predators surrounded by the most sexually pliant women imaginable (Post-pubescent Anna Paquin, showing up uninvited to crash at the Hollywood Hills house that Sean Penn shares with Kevin Spacey, asks Penn, Would you like to f*** me before I go to sleep? Or this With her 6-year-old daughter watching from the front seat, Meg Ryan's character is described as having given a blowjob to a stranger in the back seat of Sean Penn's car because she's been told that the stranger needs to relax).

In fact, most of the humor is of the snickering insider variety.

Like the others, Palminteri's acting is revved too high here. In fact, the only actors not over-revved here are Anna Paquin, who seems like she's in a different film entirely (or confused to find herself in this one); and Robin Wright Penn, managing to be believable in a fiction that asks the audience to suspend not just disbelief but common sense.This is a good film to see if you don't get enough of a testosterone fix from the Super Bowl.

Not only is she very sexy, she also acts very well indeed.Sean Penn's Eddie, on the other hand, is a basket case. This is vaguely amusing at first, but his histrionics quickly become wearing. Three minutes of his weeping and frowning would have been more effective than the thirty or so which we are subjected to.Kevin Spacey gives an amusing and understated performance, which is not so very memorable, but Chazz Palminteri's Phil has few really likable qualities.Meg Ryan is pleasant in a small role as a druggie slut, and Garry Shandling, in another fairly small role, is as amusing as ever. Robin Wright has a few good scenes as Darlene, the love-interest.In the end, however, the film seems rather empty and strangely unaffecting.

The problem with this film though is not the acting which is top notch throughout, its in the pace of the film. Long monologues and conversations are the cornerstone of a good play, but its difficult to hold the movie viewers attention with just interplay for two hours. Admittedly it can be done, just see Glengarry Glen Ross for a perfect example of this, but while the acting in HurlyBurly is almost up there with Glengarry, the script simply isn't.HurlyBurly can only really be recommended to those who enjoy plays, as the script simply isn't good enough to hold most movie-goers attention.http//www.filmcritic.zoomshare.com "}{"Title":"Do not waste your time on this movie.","Date":"7 June 2006","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" Despite having an all-star cast, this is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time.

There is no shortage of strong performances in the film, Kevin Spacey, Chazz Palmateri and Anna Paquin are all very impressive. It is Penn however who is most engrossing.

Based on David Rabe's play about a group of successful LA types drowning in their own misery (with drink, drugs, and empty sex to help them on the way down), it drones on too long about too little, the big-time cast wretching its way through it until a bigger gig comes along.       Centered around two Hollywood bigwigs who share a posh home in the Valley, Kevin Spacey plays the glib, smart-ass role in which he excels, but too often gives the impression of going through the motions, drawing on past attitudes and inflections from other films.  He is, in truth, doing Kevin Spacey's act (though a great act, I admit) rather than creating a newly formed character.  Only an assured confrontation scene with Sean Penn near the end saves his performance from the truly banal.  Garry Shandling turns up playing his usual dysfunctional Jew, but he's completely out of place in this setting.  The smallness of his range and the pettiness of his plight, idiosyncratic hallmarks of the stand-up comedian are more suited to clubs or TV.  And Chazz Palmintieri is repellent every minute he's on screen.  His crude, doltish persona is suited for playing small-time gangsters and not much else; he can't articulate the dialogue he's given. When he's given cuss lines to speak, blended in with words like realm or inasmuch, he's simply not believable.  This is either bad casting or bad screenwriting.  Personally, I think it's both.  In another scene, he cusses out a pretty young girl because her good looks interfere with his football watching.  But the scene doesn't come off because even the swearing has a writer's touch to it, a poetic lilt that Palmintieri is unable to convey.  And later on, when he kidnaps his own baby from the maternity ward, he falls flat again, because, as an actor, Palmintieri possesses so little humanity, one cannot believe he is the type of man who would be touched by the beauty and delicacy of a newborn.  It is an earnestly rotten performance.     About the only one who puts any effort into this thing is Sean Penn, but the material is beneath him. A roadside meltdown with his girl friend over a choice of restaurants is funny and adept, but a lot of his scenes seem overwrought (a coke-addled lament of the wrongs of the world, for instance).  This is not entirely Sean Penn's fault; he is simply trying to breathe life into a corpse.  But it's at least partly his fault because he should have known it was a corpse.

For starters, it doesn't have a single sympathetic character, let alone one that the audience can even bear to share two hours with. It's slow paced (that can be a good thing - just look at Shadowlands, but it isn't here), boring beyond belief, and just plain annoying. Watching a few characters we despise in the first place self destruct is not my idea of a good time. It even got to the point where I just turned it off, after an hour or so. I'm surprised that I even got that far.It's labelled as a comedy, but garners only a single laugh, in the first five minutes. Sadly, the film boasts an outstanding cast (sadly because I wish that they had gotten together on a better project). Though I'm not a fan of Sean Penn, Chazz Palminteri or Garry Shandling, I respect the work they've done in the past, and there's no doubt in my mind that they are good actors. Both Anna Paquin and Meg Ryan, two of the best actors in their respective generations, are underused, but again, neither are playing characters you'd want to see overused. Kevin Spacey is, besides Haley Joel Osment, my favorite actor (yet, ironically, Pay it Forward, which featured both of them, was a beyond mediocre film), but it seems that he picks films that really aren't very good, or have box office prospects, either of which necessary. He was in Swimming With Sharks, one of my favorite films of all time, American Beauty, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, and a few other great films. That is the Kevin Spacey who is one of my favorite actors. But that same actor was also in the substandard Big Kahuna (another picture without any characters with redeeming qualities), Doomsday Gun, and now this.The sets are bland, the writing uninspired, the story nonexistent and the actors wasted (in more ways than one). Do yourself a favor and give this a hearty pass. Actually, what I'm trying to get at is AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS.0/10 (yeah, that's right, it's a first for me) "},{"Title":"hamfest","Date":"19 May 2001","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"   Everyone in this cast is wasted.

I'm curious as to how that figure was arrived at. Was it because earlier he stated 4 people had walked out? Is 2 out of 4 the same as 4 out of 6? Or should it be more like 7 out of 14? Either way it is a rating system curiously appropriate to this film, whose protagonist tries to decipher every permutation of meaning in a moment to control an ultimate destiny, which suggests the film may be due a sort of 4 minus 2 rating. The writer David Rabe is no Chuck Palahniuk who may be no more than a figure of Tyler Durden's imagination which makes Chuck an 8 out of 0. Rabe appears to consider himself a bright spark but does not trust his audience to be in the same league. Unable to have a useful Basil exposition character like the Austin Powers film, he has his characters laboriously explain the meaning behind a scene such as the teenager brought to the house by one of the men. In case we didn't get it they spell out to each other that she is there as a sort of pet. This 'people as pets' line I suspect Rabe borrowed from Pink Floyd's 'The Wall', a similar piece of self pitying navel gazing which I'm surprised the Penn character didn't snort Cocaine off in an arch bit of post-modern irony. Later on Meg Ryan (whose oral technique is praised by the men suggesting an 11 out of 11 rating) helpfully does the Basil exposition bit again by telling Penn that a microscope would be required to see his good points, just in case we had missed the point of an hour and a half of bludgeoning. It seems insecurity is not restricted to the fictional characters.Don Rickles famously said to Frank Sinatra during his stand up act that he had seen 'The Pride And The Passion' and that the cannon's acting was great. Well, I've seen 'Hurlyburly' and the moustache's acting was great. Derivative, so that gives me only a 4 out of 9 for stand up and Sean Penn a 3 out of 7 for acting. The moustache gets 12 out of 13 for the same and 6 out of 8 for defying gravity through some epic scenery chewing. Kevin Pacey gives the usual no pulse glib performance that may wake everybody up to the fact that he's an over-rated actor. He's 0 out of 1 in this and 2 out of 3 elsewhere. Garry Shandling plays Gary Shandling to perfection giving him a 9 out of 9 rating. Chaz Paliminteri gets a 19 out of 20 for knuckles. Pacey starred in a similar diatribe against Hollywood called 'Swimming With Crocodiles' but the long list of end title credits on that film and this suggest that the industry can't be as awful as depicted here if so many people are willing to work in it, giving Rabe an 8 out of 12 for disingenuousness and cutting edge actors a 9 out of 13 for vanity. Originally a stage play, the action is not opened out much and given this, the hand held camera work seemed an unnecessary indulgence giving Hulyburly an overall 0 out of 0 for tripod wear and tear.My rating? I give it a 16 and a half out of 18 and a half. Oh, alright, half a bit more then.
