None of this is true. The theme of Cabaret Balkan is not violence. A great parallel can be made between Cabaret Balkan and A Clockwork Orange. The violence in both movies is not the theme - it's merely an extreme way of proving an important point.The oppressors and the oppressed. The small fish and the big fish.  The dogs and the sheep (rock fans might find interesting similarities between this movie and Pink Floyd's Animals). There seems to be certain hierarchy present in Cabaret Balkan. The passive majority is constantly oppressed by the violent minority, many of whom themselves are victims of bigger fish. The passive majority is always ready to turn a blind eye, to look the other way or, as a scene from the movie so visually illustrates, sit on a different side of the bus.Who should the war be blamed on? Is it the government's fault? Or is the fault of the people who elected the government? Should the criminals in power take the blame or the people who let them stay in power? A key scene of the movie which takes place in the bus seems to tell us the most about this issue. You finally stood up to me, says the young bully to the old man who refuses to play along and answer his insulting questions. In a way, the young bully on the bus is the only real hero of Cabaret Balkan. He is the only one with the guts to stand up for his rights - everyone else would much rather look the other way, ignore the situation and mind their own business.The original title of the movie - Powder Keg, draws its name from an old nickname the Balkan peninsula earned at the beginning of this century - a powder keg ready to explode, with multitudes of people constantly fighting wars, making up, then fighting again. After all, isn't that what all the characters in the movie do? The strange mentality of the Balkan people cannot be easily explained, so director Paskaljevic takes it into extremes and creates extremely surreal scenes, like the one in the boxing ring and the bar. Fight. Drink. Fight. Drink. War. Peace. War. Peace. What's it going to be? Doesn't matter, as long as we're all in good health.

I was lucky to watch the movie with a friend from Ex-Yugoslavia who could point out what exactly lied behind every small gesture or circumstantial hints hidden in a single sentence.The characters in this movie are in a constant dilemma, half self-inflicted, half caused by higher powers. Yugoslavia at that time is isolated - mentally, economically, morally. There is no valve to let of the steam, so the people take on themselves, murdering, plundering, threatening and raping. Almost every character is shown to be not fully guilty, but nevertheless brought down by their own acts of violence. The bus scene especially shows that the Yugoslavian people have forgotten to take their fate in their own hands. A young men is fed up with the system, his wasted life and the apathy of his people in general. The best scene in the movie for meTragic-comically ends this scene like the whole movie. The whole plot takes place one day before the Dayton agreement, another twist of fate, that just on this day those people lose their lives for nothing and absolutely nothing.When you watch this movie you have to realize the deeper message has been made for the Yugoslavian audience to show them the mechanizations of their lives and their own guilt going with it. He tries to hammer this in the minds of the viewers hence the compressed plot and intermingling of scenes. A masterpiece. "},{"Title":"This cabaret is the darkest one yet.

While the neighboring states continue to abuse the human condition, our symbolic characters are tearing at each other on the streets of Belgrade, in one form or another. Every character represents a state of nationality or the social mayhem drowning them. There is the two boxing buddies who turn on each other after revealing past truths, (the same as the peaceful neighbors of different nationalities who turn on one another when the war heated up). There is the Taxi driver who took revenge on a police officer, (the power of police enforcement riddles the country with corruption ).

The young Bosnian Serb refuge who teams up with the underworld to make ends meet because it is the only way to survive in a hopeless situation, (commenting on the power of the underworld, taking control of restless and lost youths with no place to go). There are so many criss-cross factors that director Goran manages to inter-weave them all in a Robert Altman style.

An apparent cry of despair for the current social, economic, and political state of the Balkans, an open and festering wound on the face of the world, Cabaret Balkan actually shows little violence and almost no gore. What is does show is nonstop rage. A Magnolia-esque format with numerous characters in unrelated situations in lieu of a homogenous story, Cabaret Balkan trades plot for purpose and substance for effect. However, its sheer drama, the power of its performances, and the superb acting by a relatively unknown cast make this film pound-for-pound and dollar-for-dollar more powerful, gripping, and compelling than anything to come out of Hollywood in recent years.

The film ends with one of the main characters being stoned while he's yelling I'm innocent. Whether he did actually try to steal gasoline from cars, the deed he was accused of, is irrelevant (besides, if he did, the gasoline was meant for his family, which had none); and thankfully the director Paskaljevic leaves this question unanswered. More important is the fact that right before the hypothetic theft he was taking part in the torturing of a young couple, so his claim of innocence doesn't really correspond to the truth. On the other hand, a mob which tries to kill a young man for stealing gas doesn't have a much higher position on the moral scale. What Bure Baruta shows is a post-war country where the ethics of people are so dimmed, that none of them can really call himself innocent. These people commit horrible acts in the name of love, hate, or both. Even the film's most sympathetic character, an old bus driver, ends up killing the man who tried to hijack the bus. But none of these people are thoroughly guilty, either, because what they are is what the war has done to them. The bus driver kills not because he likes to, but because he's tired of the chaos his country has descended into. The irony lies in that the hijacker probably felt the same way, he only expressed himself differently. It is the film's strength that even the worst of it's characters are not monsters, and in the end we can't really condemn single one of them. Otherwise we would be in that mob stoning that young man.Although I've given examples of the stories contained in Bure Baruta, they are only facets of the full spectrum the film paints before us. Bure Baruta is one of the greatest European films of the last decade, and quite possibly the best post-war depiction ever made for the big screen.

What he gives us here is Serbia in a nutshell, a post-war Serbia torn with crime, anger and mistrust. Who's to blame? is the central question here and the line is spoken several times throughout the movie, once in a particularly hilarious scene. The bus scene is the one that illustrates the situation Serbia and most of former Yugoslavia are in-chaos. There is no one behind the wheel, so everybody is trying to take control.There is no way to write about this film without saying something about the cast. It consists of all the finest Serbian and Yugoslav actors (two of them, Trifunovic and Glogovac, are from Herzegovina originally and two are from Macedonia) and it is one of the cases where the entire cast is the protagonist. Particularly fine performances come from Miki Manojlovic, Mirjana Jokovic, Mirjana Karanovic, Voja Brajovic, Aleksandar Bercek, Nebojsa Glogovac and Lazar Ristovski. The storyline is incredibly well built and all stories and characters are equally good.This is a flawless, high quality tragicomedy which will provide you great entertainment and watching experience, as well as a good insight into the situation of this country. It is a humanistic and poignant film with a message, a cry for help. Balkan-a barrell of gunpowder, a-hole of the world.

It particularly shows the link between aggression and the male psyche, the threat of sexual violence being equally prominent. Practically nobody is exempt from the fever of madness which sweeps over the city. Consequently, individuals no longer take responsibility for their actions and guilt becomes oblique and collective, which is of course when the atrocities of history happen. A hugely important film.

I don't know what would I think of the movie if I haven't read the play prior to watching it.The way I see it, all this play/movie is about is anger and despair. The play is even far more surrealistic with more killings that come out of nowhere, with more violence that comes out of nowhere with basically no character with a clear mind. Everyone is mad, but that madness comes from nowhere else but the tonnes of anger buried in their souls.And that's what this movie is about, madness as a result of anger.I just find the movie not so surrealistic, and therefore losing the power of the original text.Now, few words on other users' comments.I just can't agree with the users saying that this is about the Serbs, or about the Serbs at that very moment in their history, about the guilt or something else.I also find it very shallow to think that the movies coming from Serbia should portrait the Serbs the way they are.

It's possible to get away with having no story.  Rather, every scene is part of some larger story we never see.  Take the boxing scene.  There's something pleasingly surreal, and yet accurate, about it; it's perfectly paced and the acting is faultless.  It forms part of a grim story that I'm not sure I'd like, but at least, in the context of that story, it would pack a wallop.  Here it's in limbo.  Previous and subsequent scenes don't shed light on the boxing scene - they duplicate it.  And really, only two of the countless incidents in the whole film show any kind of creativity and humanity the boxing scene, and the confrontation between the `street punk' and the ex-policeman.  That's all there is of value, and it's not much value.  They're fragments of good films that were never made.Sure, this kind of work has an effect.  It's a smorgasbord of things painful to look at blood, bone-crunching, cocaine-snorting (something I find I simply can't watch), rape, hands bent backwards and rocks to the back of the head.  It's impossible to watch the film without wincing at the constant brutality.  And yet, so what?  There are people who think that anything which provokes a response must be great art, but I've never heard anyone actually advance a reason for believing something so ridiculous, especially when the response is as automatic as a wince.  I feel as if I've been served sour milk and then been told that I've just drunk something of aesthetic merit - because it made my eyes water.In Australia Bure Baruta went by the name Cabaret Balkan, a title which makes it all the more clear how much inspiration Dejan Dukovski drew from Bertolt Brecht - and that's not a compliment.  It's hard to think of anyone more fatal to imitate than Brecht.  Brecht was a writer so talented he sometimes created beautiful parables despite his most earnest, theoretically motivated efforts not to; people who imitate Brecht are never so fortunate.

Unfortunately I found it way too uneven, redundant and emotionally distant to be entirely successful. Surprising to me is that it seems like no critics feel the way I do.True, there are many moments of haunting brilliance, scenes that should stain the mind with their lasting impressions. The problem lies in the filmmakers overextending themselves and not allowing the madness and pain to play the realm of suggestion as much as it does concrete images. So many of the vignettes stretched on too long. Instead ending on the most powerful note, they lasted five or ten minutes longer, reducing the whole to a rather mundane mixture of hoodlum hijinx and human stupidity. I found my screaming at the screen on quite a few occasions, CUT-YOU'VE MADE YOUR POINT!EX In Kurosawa's RAN(1985), the most chilling vision was not of massacres, the various characters plotting and backstabbing each other, or the thousands of dying warriors sprawled out in the fields of war. Rather it was the moment when the elderly lord sat down, silent, broken and strangely alien the surrounding violence, to realize what in fact he had caused.I believe this was something near the intent of Cabaret Balkan, unfortunately it was overstated rather than understood. It's easy to illustrate madness, violence, and evil. It's much harder to make us care about it.And yet, after saying all this, I still WANT to like this movie. I would love to see this film re-edited to play up to the most powerful moments, allowing the characters to act truly irrational and unexplained, to allow the violence to really rub raw nerves.

Terrible dialogue, boring scenes which last even longer than the ones in the play and above all, when I saw the movie, I realized that they did only half of the screenplay. Did the director of the movie really needed 2 hours to put together 5 relatively short scenes from the play? It is really a shame and a cheap shot to use the play's name to sell more movie tickets across the Balkans. Bure barut was a huge hit. It still is. Few years ago, the Macedonian National Theater celebrated Bure Barut's 300th rerun. The play is good, simple and to the point. The movie is unnecessary loaded with characters from different parts of Yugoslavia just for the sake of the average Balkan viewer to point out to that character and say Hey, that guy speaks my dialect...not because it would have a deeper meaning of the story. It doesn't. On contrary, it looks silly.My point is - bad movie and a total disgrace of the Dejan Dukovski's masterpiece.

The first film, a VHS rarity from 1998 (surprisingly no DVD option yet), gave the opportunity to tour the back roads of Belgrade without leaving the comfort of the couch. It was dark, it was disruptive, it was random; it was Cabaret Balkan. Told in a storyline similar to that of recent films like Babel or Amores Perros, Cabaret Balkan takes a socially dynamic state, gives the viewers a smorgasbord of one-dimensional characters, and allows the traveling to begin. As a tourist destination, one may consider booking another location, but as a cinematic endeavor, it packs light punches, interesting stories, and that seedy darkness that seems to follow Serbia wherever it goes. From one sad story to the next, we are forced to enter the lives of virtual unknown, to ask ourselves what would be our response in a similar situation, and to accept &#x96; willing or unwilling &#x96; that this film speaks the truth. That chaos is normal in Belgrade. To believe that a normal passenger, on a normal night, can easily become twisted in the evil that stirs in this cold city. Cabaret Balkan asks quite a bit from its viewers, in essence to extend belief and trust that these endings speak for an entire world, but if you allow your mind to watch, your belief to be suspended, Balkan proves to be spooky, entertaining, and vividly depressing all at once.For those unwilling to experiment back with the VHS option, this is a film saturated in colorful characters. From fighting best friends, to a corrupt cop finding his comeuppance, to a bickering couple found in the worst situation possible, all the way to a man determined to win the heart of his sweetheart, Cabaret Balkan will take you on one wild ride. Despite our characters moving here and there, Balkan is one of those films that initially makes you think, That was a depressing film, but after thinking further one can still say this was a depressing film, but it worked. It makes you think about the lifestyles of the less-fortunate in these areas, it makes you consider the place and the people &#x96; transforming what happens in Belgrade and putting into modern life, no matter where you live. That is why Balkan resonates. It takes over-hyper events and somehow settles them into reality. This is not an easy task as each story shows a different side of this city, or of the human relation, but as the stories continue to blend, adding layer upon layer &#x96; Balkan becomes a stronger and stronger film.Alas, this isn't a film for everyone. Critics would argue that the inconsistent blend between the stories diminished the opportunity for authentic drama. Critics would argue that the disassociation between American audiences and what is political in Serbia would pull from the central focus. Critics would argue that not enough development of our characters hurt the overall effect of Dejan Dukovski's written word. In a small sense, they are right. Cabaret Balkan isn't without its faults, and casual film watchers would probably agree as initially this film just feels lackluster, but it is what remains in your mind long after the final credits rolled that makes this film applaud. It is a film that obviously tackled some difficult issues, in a place where difficult situations occur as the norm. The turning point for this film viewer was the story of the man trying to win his woman's heart. With orchestra and dog in hand, we follow him throughout his possible release until the climactic moment, but the eventual outcome of his sincere efforts is what shows the true horror that Balkan is trying to bring to light. My argument would be that perhaps it needed to end with this singular story, instead of the choice ending with the sadist and couple. To me, that story felt the least developed and utterly awkward. Realizing that it isn't Disney, it still felt choppy and misappropriated. As one small flaw for this film, in my eyes, would be this choppiness of getting from point A to point B. Perhaps it was the budget or just the lack of experience, but Balkan isn't subtle. The flow of scene to scene isn't there, and it demonstrates the struggles of our people (I get that), but a stronger frame to this film would have only heighted the experience.This was a decent endeavour into a world I knew very little about. It is a film that resonates long after it is over. It continues to surprise that this little independent feature still hasn't seen a DVD light of day yet. A broader audience would appreciate what our director was trying to create here.Overall, would I suggest this film to a friend or family member? I believe so. It had a strong enough messages, despite the lacking characters, and it felt fresh. It was dark, foreign, and sporadic &#x96; but it stayed consistent throughout. There were faults, many of which I mentioned earlier, but because of the final effort &#x96; it stood out. A DVD edition would be great, but this little VHS worked its magic well for a night where cinema reigned supreme.Grade **** out of ***** "},{"Title":"powerful and troubling","Date":"19 June 1999","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  If you know nothing about the wars in former Yugoslavia for the past 10 years, this movie about a night in Belgrade sometime in 1998 may go some way toward explaining them. From the beginning everyone is a victim, even the victimizers. Anyone with any brains has left the country, says a taxidriver in an early scene. So everyone who is left consoles themselves as victims of their own stupidity, perhaps, and therefore free to commit violence on everyone else.The violence (not glitzy, like Hollywood, but perhaps more visceral because more personal) is endemic and somehow inevitable the scene between two men, old friends exchanging confidences at a boxing gym, purports to show the inextricable connection between masculinity and violence, but does the director deplore this connection, celebrate it, or throw up his hands at its inevitability? The homoerotic element in this scene is, I suspect, unconscious.The sexual politics are, mostly, deplorable. A young woman on a train is sexually assaulted by a middle-aged drunk who's just killed a man she makes no move to alert the conductor passing by, in fact makes only an effectual attempt to escape, and fights back only in a way that will destroy her as well. A middle-aged woman is wooed by a man who left her many times in the past; although it's clear she's furious at him, she succumbs when he brings out the whole symphony orchestra to serenade her. A young woman who's been harassed by a punk on a bus first fights with, then lavishes kisses on her jealous boyfriend when he rants at her that she enjoyed the harassment. And how is the boyfriend paid back? By having a psychotic black marketeer sexually assault his girlfriend and almost break her hand while forcing the boyfriend to sing a Macedonian song.Sex, violence, and masculinity are these supposed to be the sources of the wars? Friends from former Yugoslavia tells me these have been the themes of Yugoslav cinema for the past 30 years. It can't all be blamed on the current Belgrade regime. Perhaps the Serbs in this movie would welcome a sense of collective guilt, at the same time that they loudly shout, I'm not guilty, because if they are all guilty, then nobody's guilty.

It's an o.k. black comedy, but sometimes hard to watch, because of the reality of the life itself. The performance of the actors is great, though it cannot compare to brilliant acting of two young Serbian actors in (by my humble opinion) in best Serbian movie ever made...Rane. The plot is not on the level too, especially if you watch this movie for second time. You get kind a bored.Bur all in all, not a bad movie. I guess one, that you can put in great trio in movies, beside Rane and Lepa sela, lepo gore. Though, as i mentioned, this one is the weakest part and that's why, (still a solid grade)6 out of 10.

Don't get me wrong - I'm sure they existed somewhere. But putting all these seriously sick people together in a movie called Cabaret Balkan where they're supposed to look like regular citizens or even majority of Belgrade is irresponsible propaganda, and a bad sell-out.Belgrade is not New York, where thousands of movies about it can help shape viewers' perception of the city. If 2 movies are made about Belgrade and each looks like this one, then I'm afraid that's a wrong picture.There is something very wrong with almost everything that goes on in Belgrade today, but I think is just not this bad.I'm a Serb myself and I refuse to believe that these characters could possible have their lives interconnected as they are in this movie - and if I'm right about the impossibility of a story like this, then this movie is only a sick fantasy.

Yes, I 'get' it - war has shattered traditional notions of right and wrong, you can't tell the victims from the criminals, violence can happen at any time, etc.All of which provides a convenient excuse to make an entire movie of long, lingering, rape fantasies.   A slobbering drunk accosts a young war widow on a train.   A young punk with a knife threatens a girl on a bus.  A man is held at gunpoint while his girlfriend is molested.Disgusting.

The cinematography and the way the it contains stories within stories are excellent.However the actual stories within the movie and the general apocalyptic darkness mood is far from smart. Whether you hate or love the Serbs, it seems this film only further highlights their tendency as a people too shoot themselves in the foot be it in the world stage or as was the case in making this film.Can't think of too many other nations who would make a film that potrays themselves and their people as bunch of maniacs, murders, rapists, sadist and etc as this film has. It seems the Serbs have picked up where western media has left off. If I had not known better about them, having seen this film would have been enough to sway me in believeing that they deserved what they got from March to June 1999.This film is basically an excellent illustration of what sought of art results when an artist completely ignores his/her responsibility to his or her country and people in times of difficulty. I don't beleive that the content of the film can be justified in the name of 'art'. How about a positive film to come out of that country so the world can see some goodness in these people in contrast to what they have been made out to be.

I liked the interweaving of characters, the Jarmusch night & pavement atmosphere, I even got off on the relentless pounding brutality, big-time irony, I felt, cool. Than I saw it again on cable, in my own living room, not in a chic lincoln center cinema, no trendy audience to share my titillation. And I saw something relentlessly ugly, like watching someone trying to convince you he needs treatment by slowly and progressively chopping off every part of his body. You watch in wonder and disgust. But what's the message?

Cabaret Balkan tries to show this with a collection of simultaneous stories, related to each other by accidental encounters of the characters. The film catches your attention immediately all the stories start intriguingly and are very well mingled. However, they fail to explain the reasons why the characters behave in such an incredibly violent way as they do and the film transforms progressively into an absurd display of gratuitous violence which turns your state of shock into mere boredom. Interestingly, every single female character along the film (with only one exception) is subject to abuse of some kind. Not for people easily affected.

The scenes of violence are not the subject themselves, but rather vehicles to get you to a certain point. However, does that make a good movie?I experienced this movie as a big metaphor to many issues that were/are present in the Balkans. The quality of the movie is doubtlessly reflected in Paskaljevics ability to manipulate various elements and compose them to make effective points.One of the points that are being made by the movie is that everybody is getting hurt. And Paskaljevic makes it clear that there are no exceptions. As many of previous comments pointed out, one of the main themes of the movie is the question of guilt. As somebody previously noted, even the most innocent characters end up doing very wrong things (the bus driver). Is the whole thing somebody's fault? How did it all start? It seems to me that Paskaljevics wants to get across that it was all an accident!!! (The very beginning and the car accident scene). Are accidents anybody's fault? Why would somebody hunt you down, even want to hurt you if you scratched his old beetle?If one of the premises is that this movie comments on the situation in the Balkans (very likely does) at the end of the 20th century (And The Balkans include Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo among others), than I would feel very UNCOMFORTABLE in Paskaljevics shoes making such statement about accidents or everyone getting hurt equally with no exceptions. If you're not clear about what I am trying to say, try finding CREDIBLE history books about the events that followed the split of former Yugoslavia (what happened in Croatia, Bosnia, Kosovo among others).The moral dimension of such statements greatly destroys other interesting points like the History of Balkans in terms of war/peace cycles (The Boxing/Drinking scene as long as we're in good health mentality, etc.., - i think it was already mentioned before)  "}]
