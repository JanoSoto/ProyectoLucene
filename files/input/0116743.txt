[{"Title":"A feast for the eyes and the ears","Date":"24 July 2004","Score":"55 out of 66 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, History","Review":" 	Produced in India by an Indian director and production crew for the primary purpose of introducing Europeans and North Americans to some aspects of the Hindu culture, this film was never intended for domestic markets and in fact I believe that it remains banned in most parts of India. Although in many ways the Hindu culture is highly erotic, eroticism is not normally featured in domestic Indian films and the Director had to recruit two British born actresses for the starring roles. It is a beautiful film which was quite successful in parts of Europe and it is unfortunate that it had only a limited release in North America.	Ultimately the film is a Feminist Tract, which is said to be based on an Indian legend from the early sixteenth century - the period immediately after the foundation of the Mohgul (Mongol) empire in India. It is a story about an intelligent woman born  into a low cast who is the servant of a high cast compatriot betrothed to the local Raj. In most parts of the world the subservient status of women at the time of this legend made it very difficult for them to establish a satisfactory lifestyle except in the traditional role of wife to the master of a family and mother to his children. In India the difficulties were greatly compounded by the additional limitations imposed by the cast system. The film basically records the efforts of this woman to use her sexual attractiveness to develop a lifestyle that would be acceptable to her. In modern parlance Maya has the moral standards of a guttersnipe, but in the context of the period in which she lived she merely manipulated the weapons available to her to try to establish what any modern woman would describe as an acceptable independent lifestyle. Ultimately her plans basically fail and the film ends with her walking confidently towards an unknown future after losing her lover and every support that her former life had provided, but with a confidence that she could face the future, whatever it might bring, thanks to the lessons in life that she had learned during her period at the Royal Court. Women can clearly identify with this story - although IMDb users in general have only given this film fairly average ratings, the demographic breakdown of these ratings shows that younger women rate it most highly.	The title Kama Sutra - A love story poses a problem, Many western viewers expected a near pornographic sequence of orgies with sexual encounters involving highly convoluted positions - their disappointment can be seen both in some of the viewer comments featured in this data base, and by the low ratings many viewers have given to this film. (One IMDb reviewer has made the interesting comment that the film might have been much more successful if it had simply been titled  A love story.) The film has also been derided as an Indian version of a modern soap opera. The common feature of soap operas is probably their limited characterisation and a shallow one track story line; but if we look at European stories and legends from the same period we find that they mostly show similar features - think only of the Decameron or such works as Moll Flanders and Fanny Hill. I have never been a fan of the modern soap operas- perhaps because they cut too close to home- but I am a sucker for those such as Dangerous Beauty or Black Venus which have the ability to temporarily transport one into life during an earlier period. Consequently I greatly enjoyed this film which not only successfully recreates a long past period, but also provides a realistic glimpse of life as lived in a totally different culture to my own. Most soap operas are rather melodramatic, but despite its exotic locale and period, the film Kama Sutra - a love story remains somewhat underplayed. The Raj showed a fairly unsavoury character, but none of the petty vindictiveness we associate with European royalty of the period. The arrest and execution of the sculptor, Maya's lover, was clearly inevitable but it was not carried out with the oriental barbarism I expected to be displayed, and this Indian royal court was shown as both more civilised and more humane than say its European equivalent in the English court of Henry VIII.	For a film to be a success there are basically two requirements, it must have something worth while to feature and it must be sufficiently competently made to hold the viewers attention whilst watching it. In my view this film fully meets both these requirements. Although the story line was a little trite and the characterisation was somewhat shallow, the camera work was superb and was a delight to the eye throughout. It is hard for a Westerner to judge how authentically the sixteenth century Mohgul royal court was represented, but as shown its visual impact was both exotic and exciting. A important part of this film was the outstanding score which contributed much to the mood and atmosphere. This score, the sets, the costumes and the camera work were outstanding throughout and provided a continual feast for both eyes and ears. What more can a viewer expect? I give this film a rating of eight out of ten, much higher than the average rating recorded in the IMDb database, and I do so deliberately not because it was a great story but because both the score and the camerawork justify this rating. This is at least as valid as giving a similar rating to films with a great story to tell, but with very indifferent camera work. After all the cinema is essentially a visual form of entertainment and any film which can, like this one, keep our eyes glued to the screen throughout has to be recognised as way above average.

There IS sex, there IS a bit of violence, but don't watch this with the hopes of seeing your average vulgar action and sex film. The women in the film are instructed and shown how to the master the art of Kama Sutra, mind you the ART not the positions. Anyway, the film setting is gorgeous and the acting is superb.

And upon the first viewing I was dis-appointed about 15 mins into it. I'm sure most males are attracted to this film simply by the title... Kama Sutra. LOL. I was disappointed because on first glance I did not find Maya and Tara attractive. Yes I know, how lame of me to judge a film based on the looks of the actresses. In my defense, the title threw me off as I was expecting something highly erotic and very porn-ish. However, other than the title of the movie I've heard accolades from critics about this movie... so I manage to finish the movie. I remember thinking wow, not too shabby, the film wasn't what I expected. It really is a tale of love. I've just viewed the movie three times in the last couple of days and at last I'm really appreciating the film.The acting are superb and I think Indira Varma was a newcomer at that time. I think she played Maya perfectly... Her performance reminds me of how impressive Natalie Portman was in Leon as a totally unknown. Although Natalie was much younger with her debut. It was a delight watching Indira portraying the deep emotions and the hard life of Maya being always in Tara's shadow. My favorite scene was when Maya and Jai reunited. The music/score was perfect and the acting was heart felt I think they have perfect chemistry.The sets and costumes were colorful and rich. The cinematography was stunning. Character development was complete and the pace of the story was quite good never a wasted moment. This is one of my favorite films about love. It encompasses a lot more than merely the thought of Kama Sutra conjures up. It is also about girl going into woman hood. Please enjoy the film with a open mind and I think you will find its true beauty that is rarely matched.One other film that's a personal favorite is Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon which is directed by Ang Lee. I grew up in Taiwan, but spent most of my life in California and I'm well versed in both the traditional Chinese culture as well as contemporary American. I understood perfectly what Ang wanted to do. There's a big similarity in the fact that both directors made the film for the _foreign_ audiences. I think these films should not be completely judged on its accuracy, but rather, from the director's vision and what they wanted to accomplish. In both cases I think the directors were perfect.

The subtitle, A Tale of Love, does help inform the potential viewer that this is not a hot porn flick.The few pieces of Indian literature I have read treated love stories similarly. I was curious though, as to how the Bombay movie industry would treat this story, knowing they do no show kissing in the romantic films for domestic consumption. IMDb was the source I turned to to learn more about this film and its production. Thank you for the answers.This movie is a fine tragedy carefully told in the context of 16th century India. It portrays a woman's plight in that time, marry or be a courtesan in a harem. By giving the women empowered roles the writers allow viewers to see that while today would would find those roles unacceptable, some women of those days could find satisfaction, if not happiness. The mistress of the courtesan school gave everyone her pupils a view of the truth and their options, even before the women were ready to see them.The movie also contains moral lessons. Maia misuses her sexuality to her own detriment. The princess, could not buy happiness. The sculptor rejects Maia's love out of fear for loss of his independence, then gets paid back in kind.This is a captivating story I will watch again, to catch the dialog I missed while away from the television, and I rarely watch movies twice.

They've known each other since childhood and have grown up as friends (or so we're led to believe). As a young woman Tara watches enviously as Maya is given lessons in Kama Sutra (an ancient 4th century guide on how to make love) by a famed courtesan Rasa Devi. Tara is allowed to observe during these classes. Maya secretly envies the life of Tara, she hates being given Tara's hand me down clothes and constantly complains to her aunt about her life as a servant. The girls grown up and Tara is to be married to Raj Singh, a neighbouring king. Unfortunately for Tara, Maya learnt a bit too much during her Kama Sutra lessons and ends up deliberately seducing Tara's opium addicted husband on the eve of her wedding! This is brought about because Raj Singh looks at Maya with lust at his first meeting with his wife to be and she is so jealous she spits at Tara and tells her to leave the pre-wedding ceremony. Tara has a brother, Prince Vicky, a hunchback who is openly ridiculed by many, who has been in love with Maya since childhood. Vicky sees Maya seducing and bedding the king and is distressed and furious! On the wedding day as Tara is leaving the palace to go to her new palace Maya whispers to her All my life I have lived with your used things but now something I have used is yours forever. Tara doesn't quite understand this and at the same time Vicky tells his mother that he wants to marry Maya and she must arrange it for him. Maya is approached with this proposal and refuses, and an enraged Vicky tells his mother of Maya's betrayal with his sister's husband on the eve of the wedding. The queen throws Maya out of the palace banishing her from the kingdom. Maya roams the land alone and lost. Tara rejects her husband's sexual advances as she has heard how painful sex is supposed to be the first time and he calls her Maya. So the king leaves her bed and takes more and more opium and more and more mistresses and no one is happy. On her travels Maya meets Jai Kumar, the king's sculptor, who falls for her seductive charms and she becomes his most favoured model and lover. Maya falls in love with Jai and for the first time in her life she feels out of control. In the meantime the king is still obsessed with Maya, pretty much ignores his wife and continues to bed other women when he's not searching high and low around the kingdom for Maya.What happens when the king catches up with Maya? What is the king's relationship with Jai Kumar? Do Tara or Maya ever achieve happiness in their lives? Just how vindictive can people be in the name of love and lust and revenge? I would rate this 7 out of 10. It's a very sensuous and beautifully filmed piece of work with excellent acting (whether or not you like the characters). For those who like romance, with historical drama and jealousy and spite all rolled into one, this is worth watching. Also if you like soft-core sex you might want to check it out too! To summarise the story I'd say it was predominantly about a poor girl trying to get revenge over a rich girl after years of being made to feel inferior even though they are brought up as best friends and by seducing the latter's husband on her wedding night she extracts the best revenge she possibly can, although ultimately this leads to tragedy.

To be deflowered and then tossed out for the deed which was beyond her control teaches Maya a very important lesson...Women have power and its other name is SEX. Another lesson that she learns is one that she pays for very dearly, revenge isn't all that it's cracked up to be. Maya goes from victim of circumstance to an avenger. Only one thing botches up her plans... she falls in love. The man is an artist, he awakens things in her that she thought was gone forever, innocence. But even angels can fall, unfortunately. Kumar (played by an attractive man) can not, for whatever reason, return her love.   So, the plans for revenge are enacted, against the one man who has great power and yet who is powerless and weak. The Raj. His all-encompassing desire for Maya makes him weak and she exploits it to her advantage. But what a tangled web we weave when we practice to deceive, esp. if it's ourselves. Kumar comes back, professesing his undying love...trouble pursues. The graphics that were choosen, I think, are to contrast the dark and almost desperate life that Maya must lead and the world that she longs to have yet cannot have. The final scene was the most defining moment of the whole movie, even her love for Kumar was a bind that men place on women. In THEIR own time, they will love. So, as the King's men rushed in to kill the Raj, Maya begins her new life. The dust swelling up around her blocking the viewer from seeing where she's going, so implying that ANYTHING can happen.

It is NOT some hot porn manual that will get your juices flowing , it's a very thick book about the art of love . If you've bought a copy simply to use as masturbation fuel then you've certainly wasted your money . Likewise if you bought the book to wave around during some moral crusade with a rather dubious agenda The film is very similar to the book . Many people who have stated their opinion have obviously watched the movie either expecting to be shocked or to be brought to orgasmic ecstasy but that's their problem because like the book with the same name this film while being somewhat erotic is also rather dull . It's not an adaptation per se just a rather unconnected and tenuous example of a book and movie sharing the same name . The only reason it's called KAMA SUTRA is down to the fact that it's taught to a group of courtesans , the rest of the plot involves something of a love triangle . It's also a movie that's not well made with a visual look of something that appears to have been shot on very poor stock film I will praise it on one aspect - The casting . For this type of movie to come close to any type of success the casting of the lead female must be right and Indira Varma as Maya simply steals the film . He is strikingly beautiful but he also oozes a type of pure innocence . It's very easy to see why Raj Singh has fallen in love with her . Singh is played by Naveen Andrews who everyone in the world will now know via a very successful American show but you'll never be reminded of Sayid Jarrah while watching this because Andrews is very convincing . I do feel slight sympathy for Sarita Choudhrey as the other pivotal female role of Tara because her part feels rather underwritten and understandably she doesn't have the same type of breathtaking beauty as Varma unfortunately This could have been a very poor film and to be honest it's not a great one either , but some clever casting and fine acting make it worth watching at least once "}{"Title":"Near-zero relevance to the concept/book","Date":"15 September 2005","Score":"7 out of 12 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, History","Review":" As a movie, this is just about less than OK.

To get everyone interested enough to buy a ticketUnfortunately, the storyline has absolutely no relevance to the philosophy of the ancient Indian book. Just having a total of 7 dialog lines which are nothing but snippets from the book, does not make it a Kamasutra tale.However, international audiences would find novelty in the film simply because of its portrayal of Indian colors/settings/customs (albeit with a creative license). However, film audiences who have seen enough movies will know a good film when they see one and this one will not be part of that list under any circumstances.Yes, the name and imagery may be enticing but if you watch the movie without expecting a great deal, you would be on safe ground.

At first I was a bit apprehensive, as with a title like that, one would think it is a cheesy sexploitation film. But, as I sat and watched, I was proved all too wrong. The first thing that struck me about this film was the great cinematography. The costumes were vibrant and really caught the eye, and the locations they shot in were breathtaking. Second of all, the script and storyline were well-written. You really feel for these characters, whether it be sympathy or repulsion. The love scenes were NOT soft-core porn, as i had heard from previous viewers, but very sensual, and really draws you closer to the characters.Lastly, the acting in this film was excellent, for the most part. Indira Varna is one of the most beautiful women i've seen, and her presence is a strong one. The supporting actors were great also (Sarita Choudury, Ramon Tikaram, and Rekha are strong standouts.) Naveen Andrews does a fairly good job at playing the womanizing, opium addict Raj Singh.In conclusion, this movie is an excellent pick to sit down one evening with your loved one. Its a feast for the eyes, but make sure you approach it with an open mind due to the strong love scenes.

Tara (Sarita Choudhury) is an upper-caste princess while Maya (Indira Varma) is her beautiful servant. The two girls are best friends, but an undercurrent of jealousy and resentment is caused by Tara's haughtiness, symbolized by the fact that Maya is given Tara's hand-me-down clothes and never anything new to wear.During filming in India, the name of the project was not revealed to government officials who would have denied the petition to film in India had it been called Kama Sutra. Instead, it was called Maya & Tara. Since government officials made many periodic visits to the set to ensure proper Indian film etiquette, the cast had to improvise fake scenes which avoided the nudity and sexuality central to the story. Upon completion, authorities screened the film and it was subsequently banned in India because of the erotic scenes that contained heterosexual as well as homosexual elements.What really caught my attention about this film was Naveen Andrews. At the time he made this film, he was unknown, and remained largely unknown after the film. But then he was a main character in Lost.

Tara has been groomed from birth to be the wife of a king and is chosen by King Raj Singh (Naveen Andrews). The night before the wedding Maya seduces the king on the theory that she has always had to follow Tara to get anything and now Tara will have something that Maya has had first.Angered, Tara casts Maya out of the village. Wandering in exile she is caught up in the gaze of a sculptor who makes her his model and his lover but later decides that she can't be both and would rather she just be his model. Uh-huh. It's about here that the movie's title comes into place because Maya meets a woman who has a school that teaches the ancient art of the Kama Sutra. She proves to be adept at the ancient art that combines dance, art, philosophy and sex and uses her teachings to make her way back into the court.From Mira Nair I expected a robust story of sexual intrigue and character study but alas she hasn't created a film that is up to her best works like 'Mississippi Masala' or 'Salaam Bombay'.

Both clothed and naked, she is so gorgeous as to defy description. Nair and her co-author have devised a more-than-serviceable plot about the rivalry between the well-born Tara (Sirita Chouldhury) and her playmate and servant Maya (Varma). When Tara is betrothed to Raj Singh (Naveen Andrews), the jealous Maya seduces him prior to the wedding. After leaving her home to take advanced instruction in the Kama Sutra, Maya falls in love with Kumar (Ramon Tikarum), a sculptor, who rebuffs her after a consuming love affair because she so fills his imagination that he finds himself unable to create. Her heart broken by her lover's rejection, Maya becomes Raj Singh's courtesan and steels his love from Tara, the queen. Kumar finds he cannot live without Maya and finds her in the harem, where he is discovered and condemned to a spectacular and particularly brutal death. The dissolute Raj Singh is then overwhelmed by enemy forces led on behalf of Persia by Tara's hunchbacked brother, who had once sought Maya for his wife, and Maya wanders off into the Indian mists as the film ends. Indira Varma -- half English and half Indian by birth -- has subsequently enjoyed a rather minor career, mostly in television. But when this film was made, there was no one in Hollywood, Bollywood or any other center in the film making industry who was a more striking beauty.

Maya is an unlikely mix of good naive girl and extremely sex driven fox, what is this bouillabaisse??

Due to the title alone, I was nervous about viewing it with the windows open. Prior to my viewing, I was unaware that it was directed by famed director Mira Nair, and was fully prepared to draw my blinds as I embarked on this film adventure. The title was Kama Sutra A Tale of Love, what was I to assume. After watching nearly two hours of this film, I was disappointed. I was upset with not only the lack of commitment to the characters, the tired storyline, and the anti-climactic ending, but also due to the lack of sexuality surrounding this film. Kama Sutra headlines this feature, but alas, it is not the central focus, and this is where I believe Nair failed us and my moment of blame was born. I would like to make it clear that I did not desire a film of pornography, I knew that this was a mainstream film, but I did want something deeper and centered around the art of Kama Sutra instead of just another cliché story of rival girlfriends. I realize that I am generalizing the overall theme of this film, but at the core of this movie it was not about the art of sex, but instead the decay of man.I did not like this film. I understood this film to be considered an adult fairy tale, but alas, I never saw the elements of a fairy tale in this story. Written in part by Nair, I saw this film as her opportunity to demonstrate the power of a woman's sexuality over even the strongest of men. In a very small part she succeeded, but her attempt to build this opportunity failed with her characters. When you make a film centered on love, or the passion of its act, you must hire actors that will give the audience that sensation. The audience must feel the sweat, the energy, the excitement of what is happening on screen or it will fall swiftly into just another Skin-a-Max midnight movie. Sadly, Nair could not accomplish this. When her characters, whether it was Maya, Tara, Raj, or even Jai, were forced into the Kama Sutra part of the film, it felt scripted and staged. There was no instant passion between these characters, which destroyed, utterly ripped from its roots, any attempt that Nair had to create the theme of sexual independence. Without the fire behind her actor's eyes, the rest of the film fell to the wayside as just your average film.Nair had another opportunity to capture back her audience with this film, but she never took it. Nair could have pulled a Gandhi-esquire moment for us by countering the horrible acting with beautiful images of India. Nair could have coupled the beauty of Kama Sutra with the beauty of the land, thus creating at least one moment of visual eye-candy for the viewers, but again, she did no such thing. The few moment of fresh scenery that we had seemed like it came from National Geographic stock footage. I realize that she was actually in India, but what concerned me was that I didn't feel like I was in India. Throughout the film I realized that I was sitting on my couch watching bad acting with recycled images of India. I was nowhere close to being swept away by a lavish love story. Wait. This wasn't an original lavish love story. This was nothing more than the cliché story of two friends whom find themselves fighting over the same man with a foreign twist. Perhaps I needed more influx into India's culture or even more back-story on our smaller characters, but nothing took my breath away. The character's lack of passion cheated me, and now Nair's choice of scenery felt just as plastic.Finally, I would like to say that (without giving anything away); the ending was rather lackluster. Void of emotion to our characters and obvious cliché India images only strengthened the forgettable ending. Again, the title of this film was Kama Sutra, which invokes images of lust and passion, sadly the ending evoked nothing of the sort. There wasn't a care in the world for our characters, so why should we feel impassioned about them in the final climactic moments? I didn't. As I watched this film I felt as if I was on a Disney ride through India. The tracks were in place so my cart couldn't go off the forsaken path, while the robotic characters did what they were supposed to do without any surprises or excitement. The only character (and I hate to go back on this rant again, but it is the central reason this film fell hard) worth enjoying was that of Naveen Andrews, but I think it is because of his Lost connection. By the time the ending finally happened, I was sculpting my own story in rock and hoping that Hollywood would produce it.Overall, this film did have potential, but by giving it a name like Kama Sutra it over promised and ultimately did not deliver. Again, I would like to make it clear that I was not hoping for a heavily sexual film, but it needed to be a stronger point in the story than just a quick-cut or a side quest. Kama Sutra failed because of its characters and their obvious lack of devotion to the story. There were no surprises, there was no excitement, and there was no romance, just cliché plot points that you can see in any film across the fine Earth. Could Nair been more adventurous? This reviewer thinks so. She could have taken us off the beaten path, deeper within the darkness, but instead she glossed over the truth giving us a Kama Sutra that was more pastel than passionate.Grade ** out of ***** "},{"Title":"Kama Sutra??? hmmmm...","Date":"1 March 2003","Score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, History","Review":"  Beautiful sets that resemble a very westernised image of traditional india with its beautiful palaces, rich maharajas and beautiful exotic women.

The title promises eastern mystique, forbidden lust, beautiful bodies, limbo, bimbo, contortion, tigers, juicy mangoes, exotic dancing, royal sex, slave sex, harems, orgies, orgasms, Indian sweets and impossible positions. Those with such myopic but understandable demands, squinting for a glimpse of nipple, will be sadly, flatly disappointed.What the film does have, however, is gorgeous costumes, impressive locations and the potential to be interesting / sexy / exciting. What the film produces is slow, mediocre and unimaginative.Miya rather insensitively opens up to the queen's husband-to-be. He obviously cannot resist. Miya then boasts about it in a haughty, naughty fashion. She is booted out of the town and groomed as a courtesan. Meanwhile, the queen is having a pretty rotten honeymoon - the Raja is a complete villain with the ethics of demon. He sleeps with anything that moves and is the worst lover I've ever seen. Miya on the other hand falls for bulky Jai Kumar, the artist ( of course ) and they practice some good love making. This love square ultimately leads to sex and drama.The lead, Indira Varma, is stunning as the Raja's obsession and the sculptor's lover. Her face could launch a thousand rockets. Naveen Andrews ( Raj Singh - damned Raj Poot ) is less impressive. His sleazy surliness is, however, conveyed rather well. The strong presence of Hindi screen legend Rekha also adds spice and weight to the cast.Mira Nair directs with little flair. The love scenes are too clean and brief - it would get a Universal rating in France or Italy. The story is too much like an episode of Neighbors. The final half an hour seems more like 30 minutes. The most annoying thing, however, is Jai and Mira's insistence on taking ridiculous risks - like hanging around the Raja's bedroom together chatting and touching. That made me livid.

She said she and her family don't even consider it an Indian movie and rolled her eyes. I had to see the movie for myself, and find myself agreeing with her. Princess Tara was a little shafted. She's more beautiful, just shut in more. She's practically raped by her husband and left to simmer in depression to the point of suicide. Maya is ugly, but good in bed....meaning more complacent. Of course, like Dangerous Beauty, she's talked into becoming a whore for the king. I'm a fan of Sarita's since Mississippi Masala, but this was not a good character. I see her being much stronger than she was depicted. This character was too weak for her. She played it beautifully, but i expect more out of her as an actress. Instead, Tara catered to her husband's lustful whims. Maya stimulated no empathy from me. I felt bad for Tara, but you never saw her. Maya was a nuisance and I didn't identify with her plight. She reveled in the fact that she could take her friend's husband from ehr until she found someone of her own. Tara never really did anything mean to her. She gave her hand me downs, whoop-de-doo....let's take her husband from her for it in revenge. That was a stupid plot point. The king was absurd. His entire experience in the film was doing drugs and bonking Maya or dreaming of bonking Maya while doing drugs. He seemed like pimp from the 70's to me. I know he was supposed to be a jerk, but he was annoying as well. The artist was to mysterious, but considering the acting, maybe being quiet was helpful. I didn't mind him too much. He was kinda sucked into Maya's game unwittingly and paid the price for it. Not too bad, but it had some flaws. Never again do I wanna see a woman's pubic hair in a movie. That was just waaaaay unneccessary! I know it's Kama Sutra, but I didn't get the sense of love that the book really tries to push through.

One of the central ideas of the film is that if a lady isn't aware of the Kama Sutra then she'll never be able to keep a man, which is as silly as cooking televisions. The guru who supposedly teaches this art to her young pupils is so stupid that she can't even seem to tell the difference between love and sex, but is nevertheless portrayed as being a wise woman.

It is also true that much of the movie's pace is sodden and the plot is fairly predictable. And yes, unfortunate feminist tendencies creep in from time to time. But the presence alone of the incomparable Indira Varma is worth the price of admission&#151;or the price of renting the DVD.What makes this movie valuable is its sumptuousness, as many critics noted when it premiered. The sexuality is intense; the locations in northern India are stunning; the costumes are well wrought and the music is convincing. Westerners are used in some ways to seeing movies about India, especially India of the British Raj. But this movie is set in the 16th century, well before Western influences had set in. But what makes the movie so fascinating is the Westernized vision that emanates from the four lead actors, all of whom were either born in or grew up in England. Indira Varma was born, I think, in Kent; Ramon Tikaram, whose voice is as resonant as any movie actor's heard in the last thirty years, grew up in Germany and later moved with his family to England. Naveen Andrews was born in London, as was Sarita Choudury. These four actors share nearly all the movie's focus, and they are thoroughly westernized. They, and directoress Nair, all got away with filming this movie under the noses of the Indian authorities. As a result, there is a delightful seditious quality to the work. But the most delightful of all is the aforementioned Indira Varma, whose stunning beauty and sexual intensity almost leap off the screen. At times she is playful, at others deeply distressed, at other times she seeks vengeance. Repeatedly she embraces her destiny with what seems to be her entire being rarely has an actress in recent films been able so to concentrate on and immerse herself in the dangers, the hope, the expectations, and the benevolence that surround her.

When word gets out what she's done, she has to leave the palace and ends up in a school for courtesans where they teach the girls the Kama Sutra. Later she falls in love with a sculptor, a friend of the Rajah, with difficult consequences for their relationship with the Rajah. You can predict the rest.What's good about this film? It appears to have been filmed in Northern India, somewhere in Rajasthan, I imagine. Occasionally exteriors are filmed near old ruins, so if you haven't visited India, the film gives a good idea of what the countryside around Delhi looks like. Also, the production put good efforts into costume (although Maya and Kumar occasionally dispense with costume altogether), makeup, and cinematography. There is music, but it's listenable, exotic but quite unlike the ultra high pitched screeching you hear in Bollywood flicks. So from an artistic perspective, it's fine.Where is it a loser? I was utterly unable to develop any sympathy for any of the characters. Female viewers may be interested in the sight of mostly nude male characters with good muscle tone, hair in long greasy perms, and big hook noses, but the guys didn't do anything for me. Male viewers may like what they see of Maya, but both she and the film are too dull to sustain much interest. The best thing I can say about the actors is that they take their parts seriously, and speak plain, relatively unaccented accents.

The story was tenuous, it had bits of Bollywood in it - all the really annoying and silly bits that make 90%+ of Bollywood films pants.  The plot was rubbish, the cast useless, and it dragged on and on with sexy bits in it, presumably the market it was aimed at.Oh, and it had that really annoying bloke from that yuppie BBC2 real life drama series in it.  The long haired biker one who couldn't act in that either.Don't see it.

The title is the only thing that is interesting in this movie. The sex scenes will make you stop wanting sex. No sane person can watch this movie without fast forwarding through it, and still you are left with feeling of horror.  "}]
