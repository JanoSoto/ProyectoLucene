Although for the die-hard fans of the comic book this movie did lack the apparent actual violence it did instead have great dramatic scenes blended in with witty comedic lines.With a dark tone and gritty cinematography filmed with fantastic sets and locations around New York this 90s movie is far from something to be pigeonholed 'just for kids' or a 'family movie'.The aforementioned 'surfer dialogue' criticised in other reviews can be put down to personal taste, as the majority of fans do find this lingo both entertaining and quote-worthy. Who could forget Splinter exclaiming I... have always liked... COWABUNGA!! Casey Jones is one of the greatest characters in film for a long time and the performances given throughout, even though can be labelled slightly b-grade, are lovable all the same from Chief Sterns to Charles and Master Tatsu. The angst of Raphael to the cheekiness of Michelangelo there is nothing not to like about the characters in this movie.The musical score is great and ranges from intense to comical - very fitting for a movie that is exactly that in its mood, without becoming corny unlike its follow-up films. MC Hammer creates the best songs of his career. Shameless fun.All of the scenes are special in different ways to different fans of this cult classic; from Casey Jones vs Raphael in the park to the Antique Store battle.Extremely under-rated. One of the best comic-book adaptations ever made and one of the defining films in a LOT of people's childhoods. A fantastic film for anyone with direction and storyline that remains highly enjoyable through the test of time.Brilliant.

You don't want to confuse people with a massive complex tale. No one argues with 'Enter the Dragon' having a bad storyline!The characters in this movie are wonderfully set up. Right from the start we see that Raphael has issues. This anger forces him to distance himself and in the process we feel his fury. We immerse ourselves in the character and see how deep he can go. From woefully staring into New York from a rooftop or letting out a frenzy upon the gang that has literally knocked April to the ground we are getting to know the character inside and out. This is the hero of the movie. As for the comedic cheek of Casey Jones or the light-hearted double wisecracks of Michaelangelo and Donatello, I'd love to see the reason behind this movie having no character study as some people might say.The action scenes are set up within the constraints of a normal fun movie with great camera angles just dying to be put on an advert or poster.The turtle effects by the Jim Henson creature shop don't disappoint even though Splinter looks like he walked straight off the set of 'Labyrinth'. The turtles are so good you shouldn't care anyway. The animatronics are fab and the voice characterisation is well chosen.As for the main blessing, Steve Barron has chosen a dark tone for his movie. The original comic book would have been made proud by this attempt at making the movie more adult than people could believe. The crime-filled backdrops of New York make a great battleground, and the whole mythological element that all crime is ruled by a master ninja adds to the drama. The soundtrack couldn't be better for the beginning. This is a fantastic movie and horribly underrated. With so many great elements this goes down as one of the all time great fantasy adventures. 10 out of 10 and a cowabunga to boot!

Long live the TMNT!","Date":"6 June 2004","Score":"70 out of 78 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":" I recently bought an old VHS copy of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles The Movie and I must say that this movie is still great even after 14 years. Now first let me that this is the only faithful film in the TMNT trilogy of movies released during the early '90s. This film, released at the height of Turtlemania in the summer of 1990, raked in $133 million at the box office, quickly making it the highest grossing independent film of all time. That's good considering it also faced heavy competition from another comic book adaptation that year, Dick Tracy, which was directed by Warren Beatty and was quite groundbreaking, on its own terms of course.Though the film is more in touch with the toned-down animated series of the same title, its roots are squarely in the original comics created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird. This film is violent (it DID push the limits of its PG rating in some spots, especially with some intense moments, many of which dealt with teenage crime and alienation, and some particularly brutal fight sequences) and is quite dark and actually kind of scary. This is by far the most mature, moving, and tense film in the series and we should thank director Steve Barron for making sure his vision of the Turtles did not stray off course (unlike the sequels).I was a huge Turtle freak growing up, and I still have many of my original action figures and other memorabilia. I only recently purchased Eastman and Laird's line of graphic novels from First and I must say that they're quite excellent and they take me back to the Turtles' roots. It is quite obvious that this line of graphic novels served as the main source of inspiration for the film. One particularly big difference between the comics and the film is that the literary source material is quite violent (and not to mention very bloody in some spots).Many people may look at this film today (in 2004) and they might say this film has not aged well. All I can say is that they did not have CGI taking control of every single action sequence to make up for lack of real stunt work. The performers inside the Turtle costumes acted quite excellently considering what they went through to become our four, high-kicking reptilian heroes.I remember reading a little while back that Hong Kong director John Woo had expressed interest in remaking the Turtles movie. I hope not for two reasons 1) If the Turtles were to be remade, it would most likely be based off of the current running TMNT cartoon series, which is crap and 2) The original 1990 film is fine the way it is and does not need to be touched by the greasy hands of today's Hollywood.Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles The Movie is the best adaptation of the comics so far, and I loved it. It is one of the best comic-to-film adaptations of all time and should be preserved. TMNT forever!10/10 "},{"Title":"This movie rocks!

This was such a great concept, I mean look at the title, who knew, right? Turtles that fight crime, talk like surfers, and eat pizza, but we bought it and rooted them on! So obviously the creators wanted to cash in on this great story and we got the live action Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Guess what? It was awesome! This is one of my favorite movies from the 90's, I'm in my 20's now for goodness' sake and I still watch this. I can't help it, it's just such a fun movie and the great thing about this movie that despite it was made more for kids, it had a dark edge to it that it was also made for the adults as well.April O'Neil, an investigative reporter at Channel 3 Eyewitness News, is researching a story on a recent, immense crime wave in New York City. She is later rescued by the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles from a group of street thieves. As the Turtles are celebrating their victory, an ex-hockey player called Casey Jones, having become a vigilante to combat the crime wave, is shown beating two thieves with his sports equipment and arguing with Raphael over the proper way to punish criminals. The crime wave is traced by April to the Foot Clan; the Foot Ninjas attack her and knock her unconscious, Raphael rescues he. As the Turtles escort April back to her apartment, where they remain for some hours, the Foot raid the Turtles' lair and kidnap Splinter. They carry him back to their headquarters, where their master Shredder is forming an army of corrupted, ninja-trained teenagers to build himself an empire of crime. One of those teenagers is Danny, the son of April's boss; having seen the Turtles at her apartment, he tells Shredder where to find them. The Foot therefore launch a surprise attack on April's apartment. Outnumbered and surprised, the turtles are finally defeated, they may have lost the battle, but it's time for war to get their Splinter back.Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is one of those movies that just rocks because it has awesome action sequences, fun actors, and just a great story. I miss writing like this because it seems like more movies that are made with superhero's for the kids now-a-days are more cheesy. This was not made to insult anyone's intelligence, I mean, like I said before these are pizza eating vigilante fighting talking turtles yet we believed it. Not to mention that there is a talking rat, I know it's kind of a weird little puppet they created, but still he's like the Chinese Yoda that always makes a classic funny at just the right time. His last scene with Splinter was short, sweet, and effective. This is a movie I will show to my kids when I have a family one day and will still watch with a smile on my face.8/10 "},{"Title":"This makes it clear...darker is better","Date":"15 June 2002","Score":"44 out of 46 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":"  On your first read of the title, you may think Ah...the Ninja Turtles...kid's stuff.  That conclusion is partially understandable, considering the fact that most people's minds drift towards the Saturday morning cartoon show, which was made for little kids.  But if you are one of the handful of people who remembers the original TMNT comic book and how dark it was, you will probably think more of the name.  This live-action version of the Teenaged Turtles reaches back into its comic book origins and sacrifices the kiddie stuff in favor of a darker, more brooding film.  This is the key to this movie's greatness.  It shows the Turtles how they were meant to be shown.  The movie is still fun, though, supplying the viewer with all the early 90's teenager slang and ass-kicking that you can squeeze onto celuloid.  The only problem is that the whole Ninja Turtles franchise has come with a love it or hate it tag attached to it, often times giving it a bad rap that it really doesn't deserve.  The film is no Blade Runner or Spiderman by any means, but it's still a great little piece of cinema that you can just sit down with a bowl of popcorn (or maybe a pizza) and enjoy without much thought.  Sadly, this is as good as the series gets (not that this movie could get much better).  The sequels (TMNT 2 Secret of the Ooze and TMNT 3) aren't really that great.  TMNT 2 lacks the gritty edge that makes this movie good (having Vanilla Ice on the soundtrack doesn't help much either) and TMNT 3 is obviously aimed directly for the little ones.

If someone in a college dorm pops it in, legions of kids will exclaim Holy sh*t!  Is that Ninja Turtles? and then plop right down in front of the TV to watch.  You have to give a lot of credit to the guys who made this film.  It was released in the height of the craze so they could have thrown anything on the screen and it would have been a hit. (See Ninja Turtles 2).  But instead, they tried to make it the best film they could, despite the subject matter.  They came up with an almost relevant, after school special type plot.  The jokes and references range from Moonlighting to John Steinbeck, and the fight scenes are done in the spirit of a Jackie Chan flick.  Add the fact that there are giant turtles doing the fighting, and you get a funny, imaginative, and just plain likeable movie no matter what your age.  Sure, it's about pizza loving ninja turtles.

Both the movie and the TV show were key in this upcoming generation's development and coming of age. I recently watched this movie again for the first time in a decade, and yes it was cheesy and tacky. However, that doesn't make it bad in anyway. There are some complex issues going on beneath the surface here. First, this movie was released close to the peak of crime wave that occurred across the country in the early 1990's. A city lost in crime is saved by a few of the next generation's heroes, who are nothing more than teenagers on a quest for pizza. Second, there is a definite connection between Splinter and Jesus when he is nailed up to a wall and talking to his sons. Many reading my comments may laugh because, lets face it, the idea of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is hilarious, but the movie spoke to a specific generation at a specific time and as a period piece it can still be appreciated.

The movie is a bit surprising, it is quite dark, there is swearing (a big no no in translating a popular kids TV show to the big screen), and some bloody fights, well bloody for the expected age audience.

After TMNT and Batman what was the last good comic movie?  Maybe the Mask, the Crow, or Blade.

I was already familiar with the cartoon series (that had apparently been censored somewhat on its arrival in the UK for fear that children would copy the martial artistry), so I was a little dubious as to whether this would work in live-action.  Strangely enough, even when I saw it for the first time in 1991, aged 18, I enjoyed it!  It was brilliantly done, Shredder looked particularly menacing (as did his right-hand man Tatsu), and Splinter's voice sometimes moved you almost to tears, especially with the charming musical score.  The martial arts action is quite well done (although Michelangelo did not have his Nunchaku weapon that his comic-book and video game version does), and the dark look of the whole thing suits it perfectly.

The four characters gained eminence in a receptive era when rap music, backward baseball caps, sticker-laden skateboards, Pizza Huts and video arcades were considered as cool as Vanilla Ice. If you did not own a turtle figurine or comic book, you were typecast in elementary school as a guilt-ridden loser who listened to the ABC Kids. In retrospect, a critic is hard-pressed to separate that cultural phenomenon from the film itself.The film, incidentally, is pretty good. Yes, the characters and plot were outlandish even for the comic book universe from which they spawned Four pet-store turtles and a rat named Splinter come in contact with nuclear ooze that transforms them into human-sized beings. Splinter is their martial arts teacher and the turtles his obedient students Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello and Raphael. Along the way, we meet peppy news reporter April O'Neil (Judith Hoag), a hockey-masked vigilante named Casey Jones (Elias Koteas) and a memorably-named villain the Shredder (James Saito).The soundtrack of film soundtrack was an instant classic. It featured John Du Prez, Spunkadelic (9.95), Hi Tek 3 (Spin That Wheel) and the ever-boisterous M.C.

The ninja turtle phenomenon compelled inner city kids with troubled backgrounds to join martial arts schools. Sappily put, the turtles helped kids channel their youthful energies into less destructive pastimes ... like... beating up other kids after leaving martial arts class.Yes, overly-serious news commentators argued that the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were the pinnacle of societal absurdity and perhaps not the best role model for kids; however, these individuals overlook the fundamental principle of childhood To be enraptured with the most bizarre things and attain enjoyment no matter what the cost.

From the casting, to the fight scenes, to the music, there is nothing that I would have done any differently.There is just enough comedy, each turtle is given their own unique, identifiable, and believable personality, and the story is fast paced and gripping.Jim Henson's people did a stunning job on the Turtles themselves, and the Shredder looks even better than he did in the Cartoons.Speaking of the cartoon, almost all of the campy stuff has been eradicated from the film. The film really pays homage to the original comics by introducing Casey Jones, dealing with Raphael's anger, and resisting the urge to insert lame characters like Krang made famous by the cartoon.The whole movie is shot in a very brooding and gritty manor. In the end though, its the little things are what make this film great. For example the characterizations.When Mikey and Donny are dancing to the Tequila song (ninjitsu) Raf doesn't want anything to do with it, and Leo just kind of grooves along while still sitting down. This is exactly how I would expect all of them to act.Another nice little touch was the way they worked in the tortoise and the hare cartoon for Donny and Mikey to watch.Don't listen to people who tell you that this movie is not really kid friendly. It deals with issues that all kids need to learn about, namely how joining a gang is not the answer because, despite the allure, that is not the kind of family that really looks after each other. Shredder's gang represents a choice that many kids have to make; whether to go with the crowd who are doing wrong, or to stand up for what is right and what they believe in.Shredder's gang with its crime and anarchy is the easy way out; but in the end is not the answer. What the turtles represent as family, who work through their differences and growing pains to act as a cohesive unit, is a model that all kids should follow.As a lifetime scardy-cat (ran out of theatre at the end of Who Framed Roger Rabbit) I watched this movie when I was only about 7 or 8 from beginning to end without a touch of fear.

The suits are great, the props even better, but what really shines is the cinematography. This is a dark movie, and it's perfectly dark. Dark moments in the film often precede or follow a sad or violent part of the movie. We see kids steal things for a local gang of thieves, then immediately thereafter we see the kids running away from home in the darkness to a warehouse where the gang hides out. When Master Splinter is kidnapped, we get one of the greatest moments in the film; The camera rotates around Raphael as his emotions overtake him and he bursts into scream. The scream echos and the camera dissolves to a broken sewer grate and echos into the city.Good camera, light and prop work, what about the writing? Well for one thing this follows the comics, so you know a Triad-War-like plot will follow. It's mainly an origin story, and leads up to the Turtles saving the city (4 people saving New York was another fad for the eighties.) The best part of this movie are its hybrid qualities, it combines the dark storytelling of the comic but somehow the cartoon wit of Mikey got in there. Classic moment; The enemy Ninjas attempt to hit Mikey on the floor with axes. Donny shouts I'm guessing these guys aren't lumberjacks! Mikey No joke! The only thing safe, would be the trees!! Wit and humor with delivery, it makes for a good run.Lastly, the best part of the movie, the music. Although it contains 90's rap, it's ingeniously used to associate with the kids, the runaways, the thieves. And the rap song at the end is one of victory and holds many memories. The sad music in the turtles defeat, the powerful music of their finding their 'Father', and the best of the movie; the final battle music. It's all wonderfully done. I give it a 9.95.One thing I forgot to mention; Shredder makes a truly great villain. His first entrance is great; all we see is his shadow and he slowly comes into view. The mask distorts his voice in such a way it makes him more menacing, and the helmet is a true symbol for fear and anger and power. He severely beats the turtles, and mocks them, playing with their emotions saying Splinter (their surrogate father) is dead. He does it in such an evil way it has to be seen to be felt.In my book, it's one of the greatest movies ever. 10/10, A+ **** whichever rating system you use.

Nearly everybody will tell you that 'The Dark Knight' is the best film adapted from a comic book. I am very disappointed at how many people forget about this classic!I was a huge fan of the Ninja Turtles growing up. I remember watching the 1987 television series religiously. I always loved Michelangelo as a child because he always said and did the funniest things. I also remember my father buying me this film on VHS in the early 90's and it only influenced my love for the turtles. As I got older and started to understand the emotional aspects and storytelling of this film, it blew me away. It is truly a hidden gem on a very long list of comic book films.This film is so atmospheric and dark that so much credit needs to be given to the cinematography department. When you're in the sewers, you hear every drop of water and every foot step. When you're in the streets of New York, you see the cars quickly passing by and people everywhere. The colours are so dark and work so well with the story.The character development of Raphael and the adaptive journey the turtles go through without their master really pushed this film to a limit I have yet to see from a movie that was previously based on a comic book. The message I received from this film is family and brotherhood. It is seen in every cornerstone of the story. As the turtles learn to fight and work as a family after their downfall, the same is being said for The Foot Clan with their father Shredder. Mirroring images as one family grows together and the other, built on lies and corruption. You see this first hand with the role of Danny Pennington. He is fed all the lies from The Foot Clan and helps them steal from and create fear within the city. But as he starts a long and meaningful conversation with the captive Splinter, he begins to doubt everything that was said from his family. The storytelling in this film was so under appreciated in it's day. A real shame.If you're more interested in a comic book film with CGI and unrealistic fight scenes, this film isn't for you. If you're interested in a film based on a comic with very deep story lines and characters that are very real and relatable, you will be blown away.

Fortunately the director lets the actors breathe and the music lets the atmosphere live. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. I don't want to be a shredder of this movie, so I give it 7/10.

Even after 14 years, I still like this movie, not as one of my all-time favorites, but enough to watch whenever, since this film has a charm that is difficult to resist (hey even Roger Ebert like it a little bit). The turtles in this film are presented pretty good and still hold up today as not only imaginative but entertaining as well, thanks to the magic of Jim Henson. Besides that the story makes a lot of sense as a martial arts drama with a little comedy and a good theme for kids that all parents love their children. There are a few faults such as Shredder's death and the fact that some believed the violence was a little over the top for kids, but today its pretty tame.

None of the sequels or spin-offs, good as they are, compare with this cult classic. This movie has the right blend of action, comedy, drama, music, and story. It combines the dark quality and complex storytelling of the original comics with the all the fun and light-hearted nature of the classic cartoon show.All the turtles (Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello, and Raphael) are great, portrayed mostly accurately. They all act like typical family members who have their arguments and fun times together and their master Splinter makes for a great father and wise mentor. This all brings a great deal of realism as does the grim situations and occasional swearing. April, Casey Jones, Tatsu, and a few other characters deliver great, if not somewhat over-the-top, performances.This film's version of the Shredder is one of the best, if not THE best, and is one of my favorite cinematic villains of all time. He has the voice, cruelty, and attitude that make him an intimidating individual. To back this up, he is a skilled and brutal fighter, making him a formidable foe for the turtles.The action scenes are some of the best in a martial arts movie and the music is both fun and catchy, which helps complement how great all this ninja fighting is (I could listen to it all day). It's nice that the filmmakers weren't afraid to get a little dark with certain moments of the action.Overall, this is the best movie ever the star everyone's favorite pizza-loving, ninja-fighting, mutant reptilian quartet.

But when a film comes along that is perfectly plotted, scripted, acted, shot, scored and directed with not a single moment flubbed or wasted, then you know you have something very special. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is such a movie. Whether by accident or design, the name Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (wordy though it is) has a clean rhythmic structure there are exactly two syllables in every word and four words, or two multiplied by two, in total. Everything comes together perfectly in this film and fits together with a cohesiveness every bit as pleasing - but immensely more satisfying - than the words, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. If ever there was a film that exemplified the perfect translation of existing visual mediums (comic book/cartoon) to the big screen, then this would be it.For starters, Steve Barron's direction is sprawling and assured everything from kinetic fight sequences to tender character moments are executed with equal aplomb. John Fenner's photography is the perfect match from murky sewers to dingy streets to hazy warehouses to beautiful outdoor country, his lens captures everything it needs to time and time again. Roy Forge Smith's production design, in concert with Gary Wissner's art direction - and on a shoestring budget - is also everything anyone could ask for few films have the same consistently gritty verisimilitude to them. The use of bold green and white opening titles - with establishing shots of the sewers - shows enormous reverence for the source material and accentuates the notion that one is watching a comic book brought to life. And if you think those are real sewers, think again! Even the Turtle suits are extremely impressive with fully articulated mouths, subtle skin tones and bulging muscles. Visually, this film is inspired.It's inspired in almost every other sense, too. The casting is, without exception, pitch perfect. In particular, it's hard to imagine anyone else voicing Donatello and Raphael other than Corey Feldman and Josh Pais. Judith Hoag is also perfectly cast as April. Only 21 at the time of filming, Hoag projects the aura of a woman significantly older and wiser than her but every bit as youthful and vulnerable. Elias Koteas also impresses as Casey. A scene of him relaxing on a bench whilst chewing an apple is worth the entire endeavour. And there's one person often overlooked here Michael Turney brings in a very understated performance as confused teenager Danny. Why he hasn't had more work remains a mystery. None of the performances would mean much, however, without a solid story backing them up...Although essentially a good vs evil morality tale, TMNT does not play a forceful hand. In the dayglow coloured cartoon, the Turtles were crudely rebranded as Heroes; TMNT restores the more appropriate Ninja wording and shows the Turtles as essentially heroic without trumpeting them as heroes (they do good things but their driving force is the recovery of their master and not the saving of a populace from the clutches of evil). The antagonists are not overtly bad, either the majority of them are, in fact, alienated kids. Only The Shredder seems unequivocally bad but his screen presence is so gripping that it hardly seems to matter. The script itself is an exciting and finely tuned blend of master philosophy, rapid-fire punchlines and real human drama. For a film about four walking, talking turtles, one might not expect much subtlety but one would be wrong. For example, after being at each other's throats in previous scenes, Casey and April enjoy a quiet moment together in the latter half of the film before the Turtles show up and interrupt them. In this blink and you'll miss it moment, Casey relates to April that he played professionally until getting injured; April in turn relates, with genuine sincerity, that she's sorry. It's such a short moment - and it's acted with such softly spoken dialogue - that it can be easily missed. But short as it is, it speaks tomes about the unfolding love between April and Casey and April and Casey as individuals (particularly Casey who is such a guarded character through most of the film).The allocated review space on IMDb is coming to an end... and there's so much more to say. Thankfully, some very open-minded and observant people have already said most of it for me. About the only crucial ingredient I've not yet touched upon and feel I should is the music. Like the direction and photography, John Du Prez's score takes in a range of styles (instrumental, electronic, synthesised) and enriches the film with its presence. A noteworthy highlight is the film noir-ish string arrangement he uses when the Turtles return home to find it ransacked in tandem with the liberated camera which pans around Raphael, it makes for a quality of artistic expression that cinema often aspires to but rarely achieves. The 1990's was one of the most exciting decades - if not THE most exciting decade - of film there has ever been. Even though critics will only gush about the other two in this sentence, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, along with Goodfellas and Dances With Wolves, got the decade off to the best possible start.More than worth your time, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles deserves a place in your DVD collection if you claim to treasure the medium of film.

In the process, Raphael (the hot head), lost one of his Sais. Meanwhile, Leonardo, Michaelangelo and Donatello were overjoyed with how the fight came out.          In their sewer lair, their sensai, Splinter, tells them that he won't be around forever and for them to use his teachings wisely. While that went on, Michaelangelo ordered a pizza. It was about a minute late because the delivery man had no idea the guy who ordered it lived in a sewer. Raphael had gone out to a movie. He stopped two thugs who escaped into Central Park and were left at the mercy of local vigilante, Casey Jones. He doesn't take kindly to Raphael either so they both have a go at one another. Raphael chases him, gives up, shouts Damn really loud, then adjourns to the sewer where Splinter coaches him on controlling his temper.        Raphael soon came to April O'Neil's aid again when she was jumped in the subway by a bunch of criminals dressed in black (Foot Soldiers). When April awakens, she is freaked by the turtles and Splinter the rat, but he tells her the tale of how he and the turtles were mutated by some radioactive ooze. April invites the turtles to her place, but she doesn't have much to offer them except for pizza. They're overjoyed!        But they return home to find Splinter missing! He was abducted by an evil crime boss, Shredder, who's completely dressed in metal and spikes. He runs a place where criminals are trained. He sends more Soldiers out to get them. The turtles fight them and soon Casey Jones shows up. Raphael is knocked unconscious, then they all escape to a secluded farmhouse.         April and Casey get closer to one another, and the turtles medidate and envision Splinter, so they go back to the city. Casey rescues Splinter while the turtles fight Shredder. It was Splinter that unveiled Shredder's true identity Oroko Saki. He was rivals with Splinter's old master, Amato Yoshi back in Japan. Saki had killed Yoshi and Splinter the rat had scarred Saki's face. Shredder removes his face mask to reveal the scars. Shredder is then knocked off the building and into the back of a garbage truck.

It was directed by Steve Barron and was released on March 30, 1990.This film presents the origin story of Splinter and the Turtles, the initial meeting between them, April O'Neill and Casey Jones, and their first confrontation with The Shredder and his Foot Clan.The film kept very close to the dark and violent feel of the original comics while also staying true to the 1987 TV series of the same name.The movie was very light hearted and dark at the same time and I first got my first watch in 2008 and I absolutely enjoyed this feature film. I never read any of the comics at all, but I have seen all of the movies and I really enjoyed it. It is so cool in everything it does.The acting was fantastic. Judith Hoag plays the role of April O'Neil and she did a really good job. Elias Koteas played Casey Jones and he was an amazing job, but I had to say, he was awesome in some of the action sequences.The voice actors are Brian Tochi, who plays Leonardo, Corey Feldman as Donatello, Robbie Rist as Michelangelo and Josh Pais as Raphael and they do really good jobs voicing the titular turtles and they are all fantastic and spectacular.Kevin Clash as Splinter did an incredible job playing the role and the other two David McCharen and Michael McConnohie as Shredder & Tatsu were really good and I could have not thought of better actors to play these parts.The turtles look so good and I give credit to the late Jim Henson and his creature shop for staying true to the source material and making sure that they had the color bandanas.A lot of movie companies did not wanted to release this film in theaters including Paramount, Warner Bros. Pictures, Columbia TriStar and 20th Century Fox, but this was financed by Golden Harvest and distributed by New Line Cinema.This film did not have the highest budget in the world and it was $13.5 million dollars and this film proves that you do not need a bigger budget to make that cool and great film that you wanted to make.The film was criticized for it's level of violence and it was not at all violent as the critics and parents said to be and this also had problems with Batman Returns, the second film in the original BATMAN film series and I think this movie is awesome as hell.The violence and the action sequences were just as incredible and spectacular and my favorite action sequence is when it gets to the middle of the film.The music by John Du Prez is just spectacular and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles theme is a classical film and it is just an amazing feature film and became a hit with fans, but was met with mixed reactions from critics.Overall, I love this first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film and it is just one film that I don't think can be taken for granted.10/10.

Was it a hit? It's hard to tell. Yes, it made a fair amount of money at the box office and spawned a couple of (awful, straight to video) sequels, yet it always comes across as quite an 'unloved' little number. Basically, a lot of people objected to its 'dark tone.' The cartoon/comic source material it was based on was decidedly cheery. Therefore, some objected to setting the film in the dark, seedy back alleys of New York. So, it looks like something Tim Burton would make, yet, every few lines, the writers throw in some hip 'one-liner' to lighten the mood. These two aspects kind of contradict each other. Still... I enjoyed it.However, now I've watched it as an adult, I do see that it's a pretty basic film. Each line/scene is absolutely essential to moving the plot on. We're introduced to the turtles pretty quickly, given a whistle-stop explanation as to how they became man-sized and brilliant at martial arts, then rushed to the next vital plot-point. Rinse and repeat.I'm not sure how the 'youth of today' would find the film. They may think it's all a little tame. The turtles have just been remade and there's loads of high-action, computer-generated action scenes like it's something out of a Marvel superhero movie. In the 1990 version the most 'special' the special effects ever reached are having someone thrown through a window.Whether the 1990 version will stand up to the test of time is one thing. However, if you watched it during its heyday then you should have a natural appreciation for the film which will keep it alive for at least a few generations to come (at least enough of us parents should be able to force our kids to watch it and hopefully keep it alive for a little while longer).

The film tells the origin story of Splinter and the Turtles, their initial encounters with April O'Neil (Judith Hoag) and Casey Jones (Elias Koteas), and their first confrontation with The Shredder and his Foot Clan. Another plot point for the film is that The Foot have kidnapped Splinter, and the Turtles must rescue him from the Shredder's grasp.

It supplies, in other words, more or less what Turtle fans will expect. The film was also criticized for its level of violence, though Ebert opined that it was mostly stylized and not graphic.The results are lively and funny enough to keep adults enthralled as well as kids.

The Turtles were played by various actors in costumes featuring animatronic heads, initially produced by the Jim Henson's Creature Shop. The fourth film is a CGI-animated film titled simply TMNT and released in 2007. A reboot produced by Platinum Dunes, Nickelodeon Movies and Paramount Pictures, directed by Jonathan Liebesman and produced by Michael Bay, was released in 2014.The film became the second-highest-grossing independent film of all time, and became the ninth-highest-grossing film worldwide of 1990. It was the most successful film in the franchise until the 2014 film. It was followed by two live-action sequels Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II The Secret of the Ooze in 1991, & Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III in 1993; and one computer-animated TMNT in 2007.

The 90's wasn't exactly a great time for comic book based films, with only Batman, both Time Burton's sequel, and the questionable Joel Schumacher Batman's, having a lasting effect on audiences good, or bad. TMNT was the first comic based movie, coming out in 1990, and was met with mixed reviews upon it's release. At the time it was one of the most successful independent made films, due to fan appeal, and being marketed as a kids movie. This is were the film had dividing lines between moviegoers, with parents claiming the film too violent, while others admired it's overall faithfulness to the source material. I fall in the latter half, who was mesmerized as kid, and still entertained as an adult. Yes this movie is dated in terms of today's standards, but what Jim Henson, and co. did to bring these turtles to life is amazing (even today for those who appreciate that craft). Each turtle looks pretty similar, besides the colored mask, but each voice actor creates the different personality to each turtle. The music is excellent in this film, and is part of what makes this film memorable. It's a fun score, but also dark, and emotional when it has to be. The voice cast (heck the entire cast) does all it needs, to help the audience buy into this crazy scenario, where mutated turtles fight crime on the streets. The plot of the movie is pretty straightforward, but is done in a credible way, despite the films short runtime of 95 mins. A unknown clan of ninja thieves (The Foot) from Japan, have come to America (New York specifically) to start an uncontrollable crime ring, lead by non other than the Shredder. April O'neil, a no B.S. reporter helps make the public aware of the new threat, and poses a threat to Shredder's organization, which makes her a target. Naturally under the circumstances she, and the turtles come together, along with vigilante Casey Jones, a character as fun as the turtles. Sadly the turtles leader (Splinter), a wise (human sized) rat, is taken by the Foot, and the film is set in motion. There's a struggle between the brothers (naturally) on what to do next, and in the end the brotherhood of turtles becomes stronger as a result. Shredder in this film, is truly menacing for it's day, and the way he uses the kids (runaways/misfits) to expand his crime ring, is very twisted. Here, captive Splinter forms a bond, with teenage runaway Danny the son of April's boss. Here is where the theme of this movie becomes clear, TMNT is about family, and the strength that comes with family. Shredder provides the false sense of family, while the turtle's embody what it means to be a family. It's themes like this, along with fun characters (with some depth) that keep this movie from becoming really stupid. There are funny, at times cheesy moments, but all in all this is a gritty looking film that captures the spirit of TMNT.

There's good reason to see it too before the reboot. It's not by any means a highly developed piece of cinema but it definitely has a lot going for it.The story begins with reporter April O'Neil (Judith Hoag) who is covering an important story dealing with the city's crime rate sky rocketing and no one has any idea why. On her way home, some robbers almost mug her, if it weren't for a humanoid ninja turtle quartet. With them, O'Neil also meets Master Splinter, an old humanoid rat who is the trainer and caretaker of the TMNT group. Upon this journey they also make headway with self-proclaimed amateur vigilante named Casey Jones (Elias Koteas). Lastly, the leader behind the enormous crime spree is The Shredder, a mysterious villain who is proficient in martial arts as well.For all of these characters, their development is even for the most part. The only thing that really had me thinking was how was The Shredder was able to persuade all of the youth in the city to rebel. How did he do this to begin with? Also, what exactly is his motive? What did he plan on doing once everything had been stolen? He obviously wanted to get rid of O'Neil for spreading the word about his operations, and he wanted to take out the ninja turtles but what was his overall intent? It never was expanded upon. Other than that though, the story has flow and doesn't bore.The first time writers behind this movie created a decent script for the characters. All of the ninja turtles have their respective Italian Renaissance names and their own personality, which gives them a considerable amount of charm. Master Splinter is portrayed as a genuinely father like character with all the traits a good father should have. Casey Jones is probably one of the more underrated characters because of his spontaneity and improvising behavior. Even, O'Neil as a character develops in some ways. Maybe Hoag wasn't a perfect choice to play April, but she has her moments. Even The Shredder is cool to watch in some scenes.Perhaps the most interesting element this film has to offer is the action material and practical effects. For 1990, the ninja turtle costumes are done extremely well. The facial expressions are accurate and are fairly consistent with voice and mouth coordination. Also, the use of costumes help make the film feel more realistic, instead of trying to make CGI look real altogether. The action scenes though are by far the most fun to watch. Martial arts are always entertaining, but how do you get the sequences done right with people in bulky costumes? Well I'm not sure, but it looks good. The actors seem to have no trouble moving, hopping, kicking or rolling around in the costumes. Jim Henson's production crew is something else.Besides The Shredder being a slight bit under developed, there are a couple of other things that could've been tweaked. John Du Prez's music captured all the right emotions for each scene and overall tone, but didn't create a main theme which is kind of silly since it would help viewers identify with what theme it belonged to. Also, the idea of adding music that involves pop dates the movie severely. It does create a nostalgic feeling, but the film itself does that already - music doesn't need to added. Lastly, would be the settings. Much of the setting of the movie is in the city, which is fine, but it seems to be always at nighttime. I'm sure other people wouldn't mind a few day scenes or so. Eh...what can you do?An old, yet still an enjoyable family action film that has charming characters and remarkable practical effects. Character development isn't too bad either, although some explanations are needed.

While tame by today's dark, gritty Hollywood standards, it's nevertheless a much more serious, thoughtful and straightforward movie than you remember.The original 'TMNT' graphic novels were quite dark for their time, but the subsequent animated series and the multi-media phenomenon it launched was sanitized and re-packaged for mass consumption. And mass consumed it was. So it comes as a bit of a surprise that the first live-action 'TMNT' film dares to be as relatively dark as it is. Undoubtedly the influence here was Tim Burton's 'Batman', which had come out the year before and broke box-office records. Like the Turtles, Batman had been turned into a G-rated pitchman. Burton's film changed all that, and it appears that's what the makers were going for here. It's a gamble that pays off.There's still a lot of fun to be had, and the pizza-loving, Cowabunga! shenanigans of the cartoon are still in tact. It simply takes a rather ridiculous premise seriously, and as a result, so does the audience.

This is about as close to perfection as can be reached when telling a story about turtles.Wanna know how to make a movie? THIS is how you make a movie. Specifically a movie of the comic book/superhero genre. Let me explain exactly why this works, and exactly why the following movies in this genre fails.**FailuresTransformers // Spider-Man 3 // Superman Returns // Elektra // The Punisher // The Crow // Star Wars Episodes 1-3All horrible movies. There's more to this list but I'm gonna limit it to these since I've written reviews on most of them, and my opinions are already explained.Wanna know what all those piece of crap movies have in common? They share one or both of the following traits they either 1) cater too much to kids, or 2) lack characters with realistic emotions.Trying to make a comic book/superhero movie that's catered to kids is synonymous with making it for MORONS. You go out of your way to cater it to simple minds, and you have a simple, moronic movie lacking all the fundamentals on what constitutes a STORY with characters. It means that all bets are off, and you're no longer carefully crafting art. Any semblance of our reality is out the door, and all you're left with on screen are empty entities moving around, making sounds, and doing actions arbitrarily (e.g. every movie I named above, and unfortunately the two sequels to this movie). NINJA TURTLES part 1 is a movie that can be enjoyed by kids, but they didn't completely dumb it down, that's why even watching it now I can enjoy it. If someone described a movie to you as being dark, and featuring complex characters, a movie with talking turtles may not be the first guess. The turtles may as well not even been turtles, this could've been a movie about four human brothers, and it would've worked the same way because of the great characterization. That's how you know a movie is good, when it doesn't rely on its gimmick to get by.3 points that jump out at me**Splinter. I'm in complete absolute amazement at how UNCHEESY he was. The most amazing thing about his character were his LINES. I mean, this dude says some of the most profound things I've ever heard in my life, let alone in a movie, LET ALONE from a disheveled, talking rat puppet. Everything he said had such weight and substance. He was not stereotyped as some elderly martial arts master with trite, cliché wise man phrases. This was truly an endearing character. **Raphael. Look at the list of movies that I wrote up top. Combine all the atoms that make up each individual character from those movies, and they still wouldn't hold a candle to the weight and complexity that just a single molecule that Raphael carries. End of story.**The rooftop fight. Remember the part where Shredder has Leo on the ground, and tells Donny, Raph, and Mikey to throw away their weapons? If you've read any of my other rants, you'd know that a big thing for me is for characters to react realistically in situations. This scene here epitomizes what I mean. After Shredder tells them to throw their weapons away, they specifically had Raph ponder it for a quick second, then begrudgingly throw his weapon away with a grunt, followed by Mikey (who also grunts, a subtle touch) and Donny. This perfectly shows the dynamics of their relationship to each other at work here, because in this type of situation you would hesitate and wait to see what your leader does. It's just like if you and two co-workers are doing something, and then a CEO type person who you've never seen before walks in and makes a comment/questions you three, most times you would let the default leader among you (whether that assignment is subjective due to personality type, or more tangible, such as job position) do the talking for you. And that's what happened here. Mikey and Donny had no clue whether to surrender their weapons or not, their leader and brother is on the ground, about to get killed, so they had to wait to see what their other older brother would do, and then follow suit. This was a great example of great writing, and I love the subtle touch of having Mikey copy Raph's grunt, just like a younger brother would do.Action movies of today can learn from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. If you have good characters, the story almost doesn't matter, as it pretty much writes itself. All the viewer cares about at this point is to see if the characters all make it out OK. There's no need to concoct some over the top plot line as a means of being interesting or original, if we don't give a damn about your characters, we couldn't care less on where the story takes these 1-dimensional caricatures.

The movie stays very close to some of the story lines given in the early black and white comics drawn by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird.Yes, there is cursing and swearing, however this movie tried to bring a more real-world feel to the characters, and, obviously, many teenagers do cuss.The story tells the tale of four mutated, humanoid turtles who, when exposed to an irradiated substance years earlier in the sewer, grew to adolescence and trained with a ninja rat named Splinter, who was also exposed to the substance as well.The movie focuses on a crime wave which has hit the city of New York, leaving reports of only a few glimpses of young boys or teenagers at the scene. Following the story closely is April O'Neil (Judith Hoag). She's ultimately saved from danger by Raphael, one of the turtles and immediately (well, almost anyway) befriends them and their master.Also to their aid is Casey Jones (Elias Koteas), a hockey-mask wearing vigilante who roams the streets at night taking down criminals the only way he knows how...brute force! As a matter of fact, one of the best moments in the movie is the fight between Raph and Casey, in which it endures them both to one another later on in the movie.We also find that behind the crime wave is a mysterious Ninja gang known as the Foot clan, headed by the Shredder. He's using the children to aid in his crime wave in order to keep himself and his troops hidden safely in the shadows. However, when he finds out about the turtles, he forces them to a final showdown atop the rooftops of New York.Being a student of the Bujinkan Taijutsu system, which also teaches Ninjutsu / Ninpo in its curriculum, I must admit that I find many of the techniques of the turtles ninjitsu to be less than realistic, so I'll take away for that. However I also know this was a movie for entertainment, and Pat Johnson, the film's choreographer did a good job considering the actors were inside of 50-80 lbs. of foam and rubber. And I felt it stayed very close to the original concept of the comic book series. I give it a 9 out of 10, and remain a loyal fan to the series for life.

The television show had a basic stranglehold on the mid-afternoon timeslot, with children locking the TV every four in the afternoon for half an hour. The family-friendly, pastel-coloured adventures shown on the television had every major film studio rallying for the rights to make an adaptation, but the nod went to a little-known Asian studio by the name of Golden Harvest, whose previous output was mainly kung-fu flicks that saw little, if any, publicity outside of Hong Kong. Fans of the comic books were happy to learn that Golden Harvest were using said comics, rather than the television show, for source material.The result is a more adult, more real-world conception of the Turtles. In this world, fights are resolved with a major beating over the head, or a hockey stick in the face, rather than the outmoded slapstick of the animated television show. It is still very theatrical (it was rated PG in Australia), but it dares to show such things as the Turtles losing fights, and even one of them being badly injured in the process. This allows one very emotional moment in the film when two of the most argument-prone Turtles bond. Hence, this Turtles film features something that neither of its sequels, nor the television show, had character development. Although Michaelangelo and Donatello miss out on this element, such characters as Danny, the young thug who becomes the police chief's bargaining chip against April O'Neil, make up for it. In short, people do things to other people, consequences are shown, and intrigue is generated. A total contrast to the mental junk food of the television show.The human element of the cast is fairly throwaway, especially the woman they chose to play April. Going by the name Judith Hoag, many young viewers joked that the removal of one letter from her surname would make for truth in advertising. I'll leave you to guess which one. Elias Koteas and Casey Jones, on the other hand, are a match made in heaven. Although Koteas is the one element of the film that seems lighter and more comedic than the television show, it works because he manages to seem more human at the same time. Elias' Casey has more than one dimension. During one memorable fight scene where he finishes his usual sports schtick, he delivers a dialogue with Splinter, revolving around family and misguidance, that is worth its weight in gold. Come to think of it, I cannot remember such a good script for what was presumed by some to be an adaptation of what was generally regarded as a trendy cartoon for children.Unfortunately, the trend soon began to die a little while after the film was released. Although you would not know it from the box office take for the first sequel, Turtle-mania soon gave way to a prime-time animated show called The Simpsons. Not that The Simpsons did not deserve to steal the spotlight away, but this meant that the film was soon buried under forgetfulness. Indeed, it remains unknown exactly who owns the rights to distribute the film on Australian home video, where only the sequels are available. It's sad because this was one of the last things that Jim Henson worked on before his untimely death. As such, the film deserves to be preserved due to its historical value. Indeed, one can legitimately argue that if it were not for Henson's usual magic, this film would have died a very inglorious death at the box office.When all is said and done, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles rates about seven out of ten. It is not the best martial arts film you will ever see. In fact, it is not even a very good martial arts film. But as a piece of entertainment based on a runaway success of an independent comic book, it works beautifully. Unlike the television series in particular, it still works after fifteen years.

And with no CG required! We're able to see each character's different personality; Leo's cautious leadership and warm concern for his family, Donnatello's laid-back attitude and memorably corny jokes, Michelangelo's endearingly childlike behavior and undying love for pizza, and of course Raphael, whose intense moments of frustration, turtle tantrums, and occasional reacting before thinking, a lot of people can relate to.The human characters are also very well portrayed, especially Casey Jones who Steals every scene he's in. And Splinter is perfectly rendered as not just a Wise teacher, but a loving father.To this day, this film is able to please both fans of the comic and fans of the original cartoon series, (I myself am a lifetime fan of the lovable toon.) Maybe because it's both dark and humorous. Maybe it's the unforgettable original score that alternates between being suspenseful, intense, and totally radical. But it also has a ton of heart. It was able to do so without manipulation or overly-extending the sweeter moments. It touches fans in a subtle way, whether it's out of nostalgia, or the endearing relationship between all 4 Turtles and their beloved sensei.Something about this movie defines around the time the 80's went into the 90's. A time that seemed more innocent yet wasn't afraid to have our childhood heroes say Damn and show teenagers in a PG-rated movie smoke cigars and break the law. It's like being shown the real world and not watching some phony BS Disney-Channelesque movie where everything is clean, friendly, and obviously fake, and everyone's personality is perfect, shallow, and plastic.I will always hold the first Turtle movie in a special place in my heart.

It's sort of like with the urban gangs we have that do consist of really young members, which makes the plot of the film all the more disturbing.The characterization is great the dialog is fun and memorable. I really like the supporting human characters from April played well by Judith Hoag whom I thought was pretty and I thought her performance as April was great. She's energetic, determined, intelligent, feisty, and can hold her own against danger.Casey Jones played well by Ellas Coates. He was great he is a bad ass that can kick plenty of ass with his sports training and equipment. He's got a lot of charisma, but he's also really funny from how unsmooth he is as he gives April in fact both give each other unintentional grief. But I like that showing how human he is and that he's sort of an underdog despite a tough guy doesn't always get the girl.And of course Spliner and the Turtles are great as their all in character and wonderfully voice acted. But most importantly I really like that we see the family dynamic which of course is the big theme of the film and message about what true family and community consists of.The two that are my favorites are Raphel whom is my favorite character and fictional protagonists. He's hotheaded as he's got an anger streak a mile long so you don't want to get on his bad side but he does his best to keep it under control, I can easily emphasize with that since I have lots of anger inside myself that I struggle to control. But he's a bad ass as he takes crap from no one and just loves to kick some ass no matter the odds thought this is also his weakness as he sometimes bites more than he can chew but I really like that he's a wisecracker as he's got some of the best lines like saying the infamous DAMN! that just blew my mind since most films I was allowed to see had no profanity, let alone the fact this was from a Turtle character which is awesome as it stays true to the graphic comic series which had bits of profanity. But he really is a softy by his nature as he deeply cares about his brothers and father despite not always showing it.Michalengelo he is just so much fun, despite being a bit of a ditz and childlike he's not stupid. He's just the ball of energy that really loves to have fun, make jokes, as well as pizza. And he's got some great lines too Ninja kick the damn rabbit. yeah that line again.I even like the fact that the Turtles exhibit some real emotion which really helps us connect and some pathos for them. The scene when the Turtles find out Splinter has been kidnapped, you can just see the broken looks on their faces but most of all just seeing Raphael scream with grief and anger which really made the scene all the more heart sinking and care for them. This also just made us all the more want these characters to win because it really felt like it mattered.And of course the action is great, the martial arts choreography is just top notch as the people in the costumes are real martial artists. This film has two of my favorite battles of all time from the battle in April's apartment which was awesome because it all took place in confined space and they are just up to their elbows in baddies almost like in the film Assault on Precent 13. And of course the big final battle that is great as there is the use of three enviorments and it's in constant motion kinda like in a video game.Turtle Power!

It is one of my favorite comic book films and it is also one of my childhood favorites. You haven't already rated the movie well, please do so we can push the current 6.7 rating as high as it can go!! As a lifelong Turtles fan, I can honestly say that everything about this movie works. From the casting, to the fight scenes, to the music, there is nothing that I would have done any differently. There is just enough comedy, each turtle is given their own unique, identifiable, and believable personality, and the story is fast paced and gripping. Jim Henson's people did a stunning job on the Turtles themselves, and the Shredder looks even better than he did in the Cartoons. The film really pays homage to the original comics by introducing Casey Jones, dealing with Raphael's anger. Here they are Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello, Michaelangelo are bad ass. Splinter, Tatso, Casey Jones they are all bad ass including Raphael. My favorite best movie. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a 1990 American live-action, independent film, directed by Steve Barron, based on the comic book characters of the same name. It was released on March 30, 1990. titular characters.A group of mutated turtle warriors must emerge from the shadows to protect New York City from an uprising criminal gang of ninjas.There is everything I love in this film. The acting, Jim Henson's creature shop were awesome. Fighting scenes, the foot clan, children who steals for foot clan. All characters are awesome. The cast, the plot everything is Terrific in this film. Why rebooting this film? Why? The original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990) is the only film for me that I absolutely love to death! I grew up with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, I had an album of the animated series from 1987, I was collecting action figure from the third film that failed. I grew up watching this film and is always my favorite best action movie of the 90's I have ever seen. The fight stunts are awesome, the Acton sequences are amazing. Everything is just great in this film.The film has some Drama in it, the character development between the Turtles and Splinter was really touching and amazing. Another character development in this film that touches me is between Danny and Charles a father and son. That scene is so touching.Judith Hoag did an amazing awesome Terrific job as April O'Neil, a reporter for Channel 3 News she acted her character very serious and convincing. For me April O'Neal will always and only be Judith Hoag. I don't get it why was she replaced in the sequels which that didn't just work. Elias Koteas did an amazing performance as Casey Jones, a street wise vigilante who becomes an ally of the Turtles. He was the only Casey Jones for me he kicked ass! Seriously he did!!The fight scene on the end of the film is the best I have ever saw. Here the foot clans and Ninja Turtles are using weapons. Like foot clans use Axes in April's apartment to kill the Turtles, but they failed. One of the foot clan Ninja's used a nunchaku weapons similar to Michelangelo weapons. The fight scene with Raphael on the roof was fantastic one of the best scenes in the film I love. This film is highly entertained, it is fast paced, not too over long or boring or lame it is a are real true Comic book Ninja Turtles film. It also has a heart bringing a family together like Danny and Charles father and son together when they were falling apart. The fight scene with Turtles and The Shredder was the best scene in the film, the combat was awesome. Tough the Turtles were no match for him, Leonardo was the only one that wounded him with his sword. The last fight scene when Splinter faces The Shredder is the best thing in a film that ever happened. Splinter come on the roof he confront Shredder and in final showdown he defeat Shredder. Shredder attacked him and Splinter throw's him with Michelangelo's nunchakus and says Death comes for us all Oroku Saki but when you Die it will be without.....honor. And Shredder try's to stab him and Splinter let's him fall in a dumpster! End and Death of Shredder in the original movie.The film opened at the box office in North America on March 30, 1990, entering at #1 over the weekend and taking in more than $25 million.I love this film is my childhood film and Judith Hoag is the only April O'Neil for me. Elias Koteas will always be Casey Jones for me. I love this film to death! I love it. I love it to death!!! The best movie in the whole world. What else would you want in this film? There are a lot of martial arts in it. There were plenty used of weapons in the film Leonardo used twin Ninja-Tou, steel swords of usually inferior make to samurai swords, roughly sharpened and straight bladed, Donatello wielded a bo, a staff made of tapered hard wood, Raphael wielded two sai (both singular and plural), dagger-shaped truncheons with two curved prongs and Michelangelo fought with twin nunchaku. Fight clan also used Axes.

It was directed by Steve Barron and was released on March 30, 1990.This film presents the origin story of Splinter and the Turtles, the initial meeting between them, April O'Neill and Casey Jones, and their first confrontation with The Shredder and his Foot Clan.The film kept very close to the dark and violent feel of the original comics while also staying true to the 1987 TV series of the same name.The movie was very light hearted and dark at the same time and I first got my first watch in 2008 and I absolutely enjoyed this feature film. I never read any of the comics at all, but I have seen all of the movies and I really enjoyed it. It is so cool in everything it does.The acting was fantastic. Judith Hoag plays the role of April O'Neil and she did a really good job. Elias Koteas played Casey Jones and he was an amazing job, but I had to say, he was awesome in some of the action sequences.The voice actors are Brian Tochi, who plays Leonardo, Corey Feldman as Donatello, Robbie Rist as Michelangelo and Josh Pais as Raphael and they do really good jobs voicing the titular turtles and they are all fantastic and spectacular.Kevin Clash as Splinter did an incredible job playing the role and the other two David McCharen and Michael McConnohie as Shredder & Tatsu were really good and I could have not thought of better actors to play these parts.The turtles look so good and I give credit to the late Jim Henson and his creature shop for staying true to the source material and making sure that they had the color bandanas.A lot of movie companies did not wanted to release this film in theaters including Paramount, Warner Bros. Pictures, Columbia TriStar and 20th Century Fox, but this was financed by Golden Harvest and distributed by New Line Cinema.This film did not have the highest budget in the world and it was $13.5 million dollars and this film proves that you do not need a bigger budget to make that cool and great film that you wanted to make.The film was criticized for it's level of violence and it was not at all violent as the critics and parents said to be and this also had problems with Batman Returns, the second film in the original BATMAN film series and I think this movie is awesome as hell.The violence and the action sequences were just as incredible and spectacular and my favorite action sequence is when it gets to the middle of the film.The music by John Du Prez is just spectacular and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles theme is a classical film and it is just an amazing feature film and became a hit with fans, but was met with mixed reactions from critics.Overall, I love this first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film and it is just one film that I don't think can be taken for granted.10/10. "},{"Title":"Simplicity, During A Simpler Time","Date":"18 August 2015","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":" First off, it amazes me to think of how old this movie is. It's already a quarter of a century old, from 1990. While watching this movie, it will take you back to that time which we could consider simpler. I mean back when CGI effects weren't as good, so the turtles were stuntmen in costumes. It also takes us back to a time when computers weren't everyday devices, before we really had the internet, and when we could get around without cellphones. A lot of people who remember when this movie came out, remember the different experience it was to go to movie theaters back then. I've seen that in the IMDb message boards. Now, continuing there have been 5 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movies that have been released. There were the first 3, there was a computer animated movie that came out in 2007, and one that came out last year with Megan Fox as April O' Neil, and the sequel for the latest Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is in the works. The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have long since been popular super heroes. I have a 4-year old nephew that is like obsessed with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and even watches the 1987 cartoon. The cartoon was on TV when this movie came out along with the other two. I believe a newer version of that cartoon came on TV in 2003, and there's even a newer version since then. I used to watch that show when I was a kid, and it seems like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have stood the test of time, forever remembered and known even by kids today. More so then other TV shows around the same era, like Transformers or G.I. Joe which also have been made into movies with today's special effects. It seems like a lot of reviews for those movies, especially the later transformers movies have been bad.So, this cartoon and comic became a movie. I notice as I'm sure a lot of you, how sometimes things that work really well as a cartoon, do not work well as a live-action movie. This is an example of something that was well written and works for a live action movie. It doesn't have Krang, Bebop, Rocksteady, the Technodrome, Or Dimension X. Shredder is a dark sinister-man who reminds me of Darth Vader, yet he is a character from Japan and his name is Oroku Saki. Also, the action from the movie isn't the kind of action we are used to seeing in a lot of action movies from today, but seems more comical and slapstick humor.What else is also great about this movie, I like the way the Foot Clan is presented. This movie doesn't deal with the turtles fighting off an alien invasion, but dealing with crime in New York City because of Shredder. It's cool seeing the Secret Crime Wave in the opening scene and how it is effecting boys. Also, the ways guys entertained themselves back then are clearly shown in this movie.Now, to talk about the simplicity of the movie. Well, this movie has been reported as being dark which it has a dark atmosphere to the movie. A lot of the scenes seem to take place at night in isolated not well lit areas of the city. But, despite that this movie focuses on simplicity like more than any other TMNT movie has, enough where the actress April seems to change in the later movies. She also seems older than Megan Fox as April 'O Neil even though Megan Fox was older when she took the role. I mean April in this movie shows signs of appreciation of antiquity. Both the cars they drive in the movie are very old cars, and she shows interest in the antique store along with drawings. Her apartment doesn't seem as nice or organized in this one as it is in the next one. There are also slower scenes showing the turtles outside their urban environment and instead in an abandoned isolated house in a rural area.The two sequels that came after this one didn't entirely seem canon even though they were entertaining. I mean, Casey Jones isn't in the second one. Danny who was a main character in this one, along with her boss Charles were not in any of the later movies. When I first saw this movie, I thought at first that Charles was supposed to be her husband and Danny was supposed to be her son, as she looked mature enough to be his mom despite only being 6-years older. They also show different locations not seen in this movie.So, yeah this movie will always be remembered with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and we can remember the simpler time when this movie was made.Oh, and one other thing I want to say is I've always noticed if you watch this on Blu-Ray and DVD how if you skip scenes, a couple of scenes will only be a minute apart. But, there is one long chapter that lasts 13 minutes going from 36 minutes in the film to 49 minutes if you hit the skip button. That's a long chapter considering some were only a minute.

It is one that everybody can connect with. We can't help but put ourselves in the turtles places and feel for their dilemma. One of my favorite scenes is when the brothers are around a fire and the spirit of their master Splinter speaks to them. The four connect as a family in this scene. That moment always gets to me. There is no doubt that you will enjoy this film. It is a film for kids and the kid at heart! Cowabunga!!!!! "},{"Title":"Maybe it's the nostalgia talking...","Date":"30 November 2014","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":" Growing up in the early nineties, I was right in the demographic for the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles merchandising juggernaut. The Turtles are the earliest fad I can remember being invested in. In preparation for the new film, I revisited the original Ninja Turtles cartoon. Which made me realize the version of the Turtles I have nostalgia for isn't the goofy animated series but rather the live action film.In theory, a live action Turtles movie sounds terrible. The series' premise, laid out in its title, is intentionally absurd, meant to mock the comic trends of the time. Despite the comical premise, those comics are fairly violent. The film takes many cues from those stories. The plot &#x96; which shows the Turtles' first encounter with April O'Neil, Raphael meeting Casey Jones, the rivalry between Splinter and the Foot, and the showdown with Shredder &#x96; is straight from the source material. By following the comics closely, the film is lent a grittiness which helps the ridiculous premise go down easier. The filmmakers were smart enough to realize that the cartoon, silly as it was, was the popular incarnation of the characters. So April O'Neil is a reporter, Michelangelo spouts surfer slang, the Turtles love pizza, and Leonardo's swords draw blood only once. There's even a few shout-outs to the show, like April's yellow trench coat or the heroes tooling around in a VW van.By blending the comic and the cartoon, the film achieves an impressive tonal balancing act. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is still considerably edgier then the cartoon. Raphael shouts Damn! so much that it almost becomes his catchphrase. Unlike the cartoon, there are real risks involved. The Foot intends on killing the Turtles. They torture Splinter and burn down April's shop. Shredder runs a crime cartel, uninterested in world domination. Yet the film indulges in slapstick goofiness. Michelangelo goofs around during the fight scene. There's even silly sound effects when Donatello squirts water in the ninjas' faces. The fight scenes are far-fetched enough that I'm baffled the film was criticized for its violence upon release.What ultimately holds the movie together isn't its mixture of grit and goof but its sincerity. The film firmly grasps the Turtles' personalities. Leonardo is the leader. Though seemingly self-assured, and easily holding the team together, he is gripped with self-doubt. Raphael is less cool and rude then a rage-oholic. Anger boils inside of him, only vented by beating random street vigilantes. That rage forces a schism between Raph and his brothers. Early on, during a surprising scene, Splinter reminds Raph that his family is there to help him. That emphasis on familial love forms the film's heart. The rivalry between Leo and Raph drives the middle portion and their reconciliation creates a strong dynamic for the finale. The Turtles' bond holds them together and Splinter's fatherly love connects them. The four are reduced to tears when their father calls to them using mystical joo-joo.Many flicks of the time had anti-crime messages, encouraging kids to stay away from drugs and gangs. TMNT has one of those too, yet never feels preachy. The warehouse where the Foot Clan hangs out reminded me of Pinocchio's Pleasure Island. The teens play video games, skate board, and dance. The limits of a PG prevent the sex and drugs from being on screen but both are implied. The kids in the Foot Clan have troubled home lives. Without laying it on too thick, the script understands that the kids' anger is born of pain and rejection. Shredder and the Foot Clan preys on that vulnerability, creating a place where the boys feel accepted, all while indoctrinating them into a life of crime. The Turtles' bond gives them strength. The same sort of acceptance is what the troubled youths need and what Danny, the young boy that moves the plot along, ultimately accepts. The film doesn't hammer home this moral, instead letting it breath naturally.Something people probably don't talk about much is how good Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles look. Director Steve Barron didn't have the most notable resume before this, mostly directing music videos, previous Jim Henson productions, and cult classic Electric Dreams. Yet his Ninja Turtles is handsome. The sets are beautifully constructed, subtly invoking the look of the original comics. There's a surprising moodiness to Barron's composition. The scene where Splinter and Raphael talk is filmed in intimate close-up, the room behind them dark. Shredder's first appearance has his shadow dramatically cast on the floor. The way the camera emphasizes the sharp curves of his armor draws a direct line from Darth Vader to the Shredder. The villains' final showdown with the heroes is seriously tense. Moreover, the special effects in the film are fantastic. The Turtle suits are beautifully realized. While watching, never once did I see the Turtles as anything other then living characters. They blink, smile, gasps, and talk seamlessly. Even the fight scenes are believably pulled off, which is impressive since I'm sure the actors inside the suits could barely see.In conclusion, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles The Movie might be my favorite incarnation of the characters. More or less everything I associate with the franchise is proudly, and fantastically, represented here. Elias Koteas is perfectly cast as Casey Jones. The film moves along at a smooth rate, even allowing for quieter moments like the extended stay on the farm. Really, the only issue I can pick with the film is that Michelangelo and Donatello get the short stick as far as characterization goes. The movie has aged fairly well, aside from a one-off reference to Moonlighting and some synth-clicking on the otherwise fantastic score. (Oh, and Turtle Power, I guess.) Maybe it's the nostalgia talking, but I think it's true now as it was when I was six years old This movie is awesome.

The chemistry between the turtles is believable, like they are really brothers in arms. Some of the things the turtles say might come off as uber lame, but it isn't all that bad and it's watchable. The turtle costume designs I thought is actually quite decent for when this movie first came out. The story is kid friendly and deals with teenage rebellion and how the bad guys are manipulating them for their own agenda. The actress that plays April O'Neil changes throughout this trilogy and I personally thought the actress that played her did the best job. As this brash, feisty and yet heartfelt reporter. For a movie that came out during the 90's revolving around overgrown vigilante turtles this movie is actually quite watchable. When I first saw this movie as kid, I thought it was one of the coolest thing ever.

The humanoid chelonian characters are pretty far out. A wise pet rodent named Master Splinter who mimicked his Japanese master's moves and has taught himself how to be a ninja has moved to New York City where he discovers four baby turtles crawling around in a pool of radioactive slim in the sewer. Naturally, Splinter is shocked after he collects them in a coffee can, and they start talking the following day! Splinter teaches them the art of invisibility&#x97;the art of the ninja. The radioactive waste in the sewer exerts a strange, unreal effect on these turtles and they grow to ten times their size. Now, they look like over-grown midgets. Splinter names them Leonardo, Raphael, Michaelangelo, and Donatello. Of course, music video director Steve Barron and freshman film scribes Todd W. Langen and Bobby Herbeck have adapted Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird's characters and unleashed them in a crime thriller about a renegade Japanese ninja who has assembled a small army of children to steal the island of Manhattan blind. Sure, recruiting kids as criminals to steal is reminiscent of Charles Dickens' second novel Oliver Twist. Channel 3 television anchor lady, April O'Neil (Judith Hoag of Armageddon), is determined to get to the bottom of the unsolved crime wave. As the film unfolds, these youthful thieves try to steal April's purse, but Raphael comes to her rescue. Raphael ties them up and leaves them for the police to haul off. Naturally, April cannot believe her eyes after she meets the Turtles and Splinter. Now, more than ever, she wants to expose the Foot Clan, but she gets no help from frustrated N.Y.P.D Chief Stearns (Raymond Serra of Prizzi's Honor) who brings pressure down on April's boss, Charles Pennington (Jay Patterson of Street Smart), to take April off the story. Stearns has arrested Pennington's larcenous son Danny (Michael Turney of Cost of Living) who has been nabbed for stealing. Indeed, Danny is a member of this secret underworld organization. Meanwhile, April is working with them to bring the heat down on Chief Stearns. Stearns compels Charles to fire April. Splinter's arch enemy, the Shredder--the Asian equivalent in looks and voice to Star Wars villain Darth Vader--dispatches his American ninjas to take care of the Turtles. Shredder's abduct Splinter while April and the Turtle quartet leave the city to hide out on a remote farm out in the country. The Turtles are at a loss as to what they can do until Splinter contacts them through telepathy despite being held in chains like the Count of Monte Cristo in an abandoned factory. Leonardo congregates the other three around a campfire, and and they meditate at length. This group meditation effort enables them to conjure up Splinter's spirit, and Splinter communicates momentarily with them. Our quartet of half-shell heroes hates the fact that Splinter has been captured. Indeed, Michaelangelo grows so emotional that he cannot help but cry. A hockey stick wielding vigilante, Casey Jones (Elias Koteas of Shutter Island), who clashed with Raphael earlier, joins them as they battle Shredder and his ninjas. Clearly, Barron and his writers needed a real human to give April a romantic relationship. Incidentally, Casey Jones doesn't reappear in the 2014 reboot, and the origins of the Turtles is tweaked.Muppets mastermind Jim Henson created Splinter and the Turtles look amusing. Splinter looks more realistic than the Turtles with their variously colored bandannas that they wear like masks. Michaelangelo has an orange bandannas, Raphael prefers the color red, Leonardo adopts blue as his color, and Donatello dresses in purple. Entertainment Weekly reviewer Owen Gleiberman complained in his review of the original film that the Turtles lacked personality. According to Gleiberman, only Raphael had a shred of personality. Essentially, Gleiberman is correct. Indeed, our heroes lack differentiation aside from the difference in their weapons. Raphael wields the sai, a three-pronged weapon which resembles a fork. Leonardo carries the katana, a traditional Japanese sword used in feudal Japan. Michaelangelo prefers the nunchuks, and Donatello dazzles his adversaries with a staff.Barron doesn't malinger for a moment aside from some obvious expository bits of dialogue. The action is swift and cool. The Turtles uses some profanity, usually the word damn. The humor shines through, and the scene in April's apartment above an antiques shop when the Turtles conceal themselves from Danny and his father are amusing. Henson complained about the dark nature of the film. Juvenile delinquents smoke stogies and gamble. The Turtles like to use the D-word. The sewer sets look genuine, and Judith Hoag makes a plucky damsel-in-distress. Incidentally, aside from some Big Apple landmark shots, such as the Twin Towers in the first scene, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was lensed largely in North Carolina by Raymond Chow's Golden Harvest studio.

In fact, it's mostly goofy and dumb. However, it also has two things that the newer, flashier film lacks pacing and heart.Though there are great action scenes here, this film knows that none of it leaves much impact without interesting characters. The movie takes time out to let us get to know the turtles, Splinter, Casey, and April. The turtles really do seem like brothers; we seem them argue and goof off like teenage guys do, so when one of them is hurt, we feel the emotional impact. April may not be the strongest heroine around, but she actually has a personality in this. And let's face it, Megan Fox in the new film makes Judith Hoag look like Meryl Streep.Of course, this film's main drawbacks are a disappointing climax and the fact that the Shredder's evil plan makes little sense. Still, TMNT 1990 succeeds as a story on the most basic of levels, remembering that all the fight scenes in the world cannot compensate for a lack of emotional stakes. And that is what makes it so memorable, even two decades afterward.

When watching Tarantino, it is hard to imagine that the same hand was responsible for the Turtles, and yet this is the case.Growing up in the 1980s, the two big influences on my childhood were the Turtles and He-Man. Both received feature films. The Turtles received this -- a clever, dark and yet humorous story along with a worthy sequel. He-Man had some bizarre alternate dimension story. (Let us not even talk about Super Mario Brothers.) Not only is this film great, but it is even better when you realize how horribly wrong it could have gone.Further, for me, this was a defining role for Elias Koteas. He has been in many big films, but this was his breakout role and still the role I picture him in despite the added decades and receding hairline...

I've always considered myself a big fan of the Heroes in a Halfshell, but in recent years, I've lost interest in TMNT and moved onto other franchises. Now of course, I'm back to the sewers and consuming everything TMNT related. There's various TV shows, video games, comic books and of course, the live action movies which I was surprised to find out hold up extremely well today. While the second film in the trilogy is good and the third isn't as bad as it's often made out to be, the first one is the most well made and the best film of the trilogy, delivering a charm only four anthropomorphic turtles can deliver. The entire concept of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was conceived by both Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird who originally created them to parody the dark, gritty comic books of the early 80s. Of course, the series branched away and became a pop culture phenomenon of it's own and when something becomes a monstrous hit, you can almost guarantee a motion picture is right down the alley. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles hit the theaters in 1990 and instead of it being a continuation of the hit cartoon series, the film goes back to it's source material and starts it's own continuity. Sure, the Turtles are fun, lovable and quirky as heck but they're very much like their original comic book counterparts, which were edgy and at times grim. And the one who was responsible for bringing the turtles to life was the Muppet Master himself, Jim Henson. It's astonishing what Henson and his crew were able to accomplish with the art of animatronics and puppetry and the men underneath the turtle suits must have had to practice an awful lot to get the film's fight scenes just right. I also like the voice acting. We have Cousin Oliver voicing Michelangelo, Mouth from The Goonies voicing Donatello, Takashi as Leonardo and Elmo as Splinter. We also have the mother from the Halloweentown movies playing April O'Neal, who turns out to be much more heroic in this version than she was in the 80s cartoon. And Casey Jones is played by Elias Koteas, delivering a slick tough guy who turns out to be quite the turtles' equal in combat. I mean, the guy wears a hockey mask and beats people with a stick. It doesn't get anymore awesome than that! Speaking of action, this film is in no way in short supply of it. I'm willing to bet that this film has more action scenes then any other film in 1990. The final battle between the turtles, Splinter and Shredder is one of the greatest fight scenes in a film about mutant reptiles. It's just a pity that Splinter's fight with Shredder ended so quickly. In the original comics, all the turtles had to work together to stop Shredder and they beat the living tar out of him. Nevertheless, this film has a lot of entertaining action as the turtles fight gang members, Foot Clan soldiers and at times, each other. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles has flaws, but then again, what doesn't? Sure, some of the acting is bad and the writing can be a bit off at times, but when you get right down to it, this film is an entertaining 1 and 1/2 hours. Unlike some of the action films you see nowadays, this film won't leave you bored nor will it leave a bad taste in your mouth. It's fun, filled with humor and has life like turtles with a lot of expression and emotion. Now if Michael Bay and his crew work hard and make the turtles as relatable and realistic as possible, I think 2014's TMNT can be just as good. Cowabunga!

Everything was all about the Turtles back then, Turtle mania, everything was pizza, skateboarding, martial arts and using surfer slang...particularly annoying.The plot is an origins plot obviously, telling the story of how the Turtles come to meet 'April' and 'Casey', how they came into existence and their first battle with 'Shredder' and his Foot Clan. What is good about this film is the fact they incorporated elements from both the original comic book and the popular cartoon. At the same time the film was also quite dark in places and with a lot so called bad influential material such as kids being taught the ways of crime, stealing, lying, general delinquency and of course weapon based fighting. But really parents! what did you expect?.The classic of course being the UK having a heavily cut version of the film to avoid the showing nunchaku violence, the fact the entire franchise was renamed 'Teenage Mutant HERO Turtles' and they cut the finale scene with Shredder. Germany also included cartoon sound effects to lessen the impact of the fighting, pfft! these Euro countries huh.Myself I enjoyed this film back in the day and I still do today. I loved how the film is dark and gloomy in places, its still highly childish and dumb naturally but the essence is quite a fine line. The sequence where 'Raph' loses it after 'Splinter' is taken is actually quite scary for kids I think, a very dark moment. In fact most scenes with Raph are quite edgy really, for a kids film, I always wanted him to swear haha. The fight sequences are pretty neat and do show the actors performing some decent moves in the suits...something you don't really expect seeing how bulky they look. Of course you never see anything nasty, its all quite tame and more in line with the cartoon but its still fun.This made possible in my opinion by a few factors. Firstly the entire film has a darkish gritty look about it, the picture quality isn't polished and shiny like some big franchises, this could be down to the fact the film was an independent film. I don't think this was intended, its just one of those happy/lucky mistakes, although the lighting is dim throughout. Secondly the Turtle suits are very good and very different from the later more kiddie friendly suits. The colour scheme is darker, the eyes are smaller, in general the faces/masks just looks slightly meaner. The later suits were brighter and with much bigger eyes (Disney eyes). Thirdly the weapons all looked pretty realistic too, if you get a look at them, they don't look like rubber n plastic, they look surprisingly good. As mentioned the actors all move nicely within the suits too, no restrictions it seems. Fourthly I think the main villain is played brilliantly by Saito. He goes at it for real, not a hint of ham or hokeyness, he plays Shredder as if he were a real crime lord and a complete bastard. True he doesn't actually do anything accept growl all the time...'TURTLES!!!', but its the way he does it, the dude owned this role. Oh and his outfit looked sweet too, you'd think it would look cheesy but it fudging rocks!.lastly I give kudos to the voice actors who really brought the characters to life. Never really liked the voice for Raph gotta be honest, he sounds like he's slow or something. The other three are great, really got into the Turtles vibe and made you believe, especially liked Corey Feldman contribution for 'Donatello', the guy was born to be that characters voice. In fact the whole cast does well in this film in all honesty, everyone plays it for real (to a degree) and thusly the film doesn't come across like a dumb kids film. Koteas goes a bit far in places, clearly enjoying himself, but its fun to watch him.Its hard to say but this film is a bit of a classic now, a cult classic. The first and easily the best Turtles film but also a film that played out well for adults too, a film with giant rubber ninja turtle suits!. It helps that Jim Henson was the creative team behind the suits. The film ends on a bit of a damp spot in all fairness, anti climax really, but that doesn't hinder the overall experience. Hell even the rap song in the end credits was massive!, Turtle power baby!.8/10 "},{"Title":"The Definition of cool..","Date":"11 July 2013","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":" The Good-Old-Days of entertainment..

I was with my best bud and my parents had dropped him and I off at a mall on an off-amusement park day on our holiday in CA from AZ.I was skeptical at first. I have always loved movies, and watched pretty much anything, everything back then as a high school'er. But, this looked cheesy from the trailers, even though I was both a fan of the show and the one sarcastic, fun-times turtle character, Michelangelo. Still, we weren't visiting one of the three parks that day and had time to kill. So, why not?I had fun back then. I was thoroughly impressed with it. It had me rolling in laughter, I believed in the fantasy they created with the rubber-suited Turtles and, um, Rat and it had enough action to keep us both entertained. I gave it back then, 4/5 stars.Today, revisiting it after not seeing it for twenty years, I have changed my opinion down to&#x85;just 3½/5 stars. So, not much of a change.Probably my biggest problem, or reason for the half star decrease in 20 years, is because the movie was just too dark. I'm speculating that it was the lack of faith people would believe the rubber-suited turtles would look real in bright lights. I really don't know. But, what I do know, that combined with the darkness for the majority of the picture and the poor transfer on BluRay, it just wasn't as fun as when I originally viewed it, or the few times following my initial viewing.I won't downgrade a movie due to the lack of interest or funds to produce a high quality BluRay, but I did for the confidence the director had with the lighting.I digress The movie revolves around a crime spree in the big city and a band of brothers, er, mutant turtles who team up with both a reporter and a fellow, and hilarious, vigilante to fight this injustice.That's the gist of it. Having to get past the fact no one would freak about a green 5'5 creature in a trench coat or how someone is amazed up front, but within seconds okay with a talking giant turtle or rat, is up to the viewer. You really have to suspend your disbelief. If you can and understand where this came from and know it's not just the 1990s, but 1990, then you might have as much fun as I have over the years.See it!

The hype around this film which was released at the height of the Turtles craze almost rivalled that of the previous years Batman movie and for a young 12 year old who was a huge Ninja Fan anyway this film was absolutely everything it was supposed to be.This, I have now come to realise was an extremely rare occurrence. At a time where movie studios pretty much did what they liked with a licence with no regard to the source material and with the subject matter being firmly kid-orientated thanks to the cartoon, this could have been a bungling mess of cheap cuts, tacky lines and 'boing' sound effects......but oh lord it wasn't!All kudos must go to Director Steve Barren. He not only kept the mass fans of the cartoon happy but also was fairly true to the roots of the comics as well. yes the film has it's fun moments but it is certainly a much more grown up version of the Turtles story and this added a whole new dimension. The thing that makes the film is that it took a brave stance on the content. It didn't pander to the very young kids with braindead dialogue and toned down cartoon action. It's a very dark film, with much more mature content than you'd think would be allowed for a major cashing in on a kids cartoon. Proper fights, adult themes and even pushing the language a bit further than would maybe be comfy for parents of very young children but this only served to make one who is just coming into his teenage years feel like he is being treated with respect when watching the movie. The film has a real gruff, grimy look to it. New York city is portrayed with grubby streets full of trash with dark alleyways and lots of shadows (Very strangely reminding me of Level 2 of the game The last Ninja 2 which is set in New York streets) The films look has a very grainy feel to it, whether this was down to low budget or deliberate I don't know but it added a very dark feel to the action.Barren and the actors hit a perfect balance between the jokey wisecracks and the action packed fights (of which there are many) The humour from the cartoon is retained but it IS actually funny as the green ninjas take the utter mick out of the foot clan whilst simultaneously kicking the seven shades out of them and never once does the humour feel forced or insultingly dumbed down.The fights themselves are actually very well co-ordinated and Barren makes sure that not much is held back in terms of how violent it is with good solid punch and kick sound effects although at no point does it ever seem gratuitous. This of course was in a time where Hollywood hadn't really caught up to the quality of Hong Kong fight scenes and although the later Turtles films had much superior choreography (But inferior films in themselves) the fights in this film do just right, no more and no less.Jim Henson's workshop did a fantastic and groundbreaking at the time job. The Turtles look and move great with all the facial expressions truly realised and used to full effect. This is another feather in Barren's cap as he fought to get Jim Henson and his team on board.All the performances are pretty much bang on thanks to a script which point blank refused to be dumbed down and actually dealt with some pretty dark subjects such as gang influence and teenage runaways and criminals.Special Kudos must go to the voice actors, and in particular Kevin Clash's performance as Splinter. The soft, emotional oriental tones of the old ninja master rat truly displays a feeling of wisdom and fatherhood and one could almost be moved to tears with the felling in is voice. I could sit and listen to it for hours!I think I wore this tape out when I got it on pirate Betamax a few months before it hit the cinema. All expectations were met and I think I once dubbed it 'The Perfect Film'This was of course before I had seen Terminator 2 but even today this film still stands up very well thanks to the makers standing their ground and making a piece of film that had a bit of heart and soul that wouldn't pander to the goofy quick buck brigade.

Like so many other kids at the time, I was really into the animated series and had a decent sized collection of the merchandise. Then in 1990 came the first feature film, and for my generation it was a major event. Not surprisingly it was a hit at the box office and on video and spawned two sequels, a live-action TV series, a new animated series, a 2007 animated feature film, and even a few imitations.

An excellent score. Some genuinely touching moments.Cons Some things, like the clothing and music, really date the film.

I loved the cartoon, collected the toys, and was psyched to see the movies. Now, when I was a kid, I didn't care too much for this film despite my love for the franchise. At the time, it seemed too dark and moody. It didn't feel like the Ninja Turtles I knew from TV. Since I've grown, I've gotten some newfound respect for this movie. Yes, it's a bit darker than the campy cartoon series but it stays a bit closer to the comic book subject matter and keeps it entertaining for adult audiences. For the uninitiated, the film centers of the four Ninja Turtles nearing completion of their ninjitsu training at the hands of their master, Splinter. Around this time, a silent crime wave is spreading through New York City as ninjas have turned to pick-pocketing, stealing electronics, and recruiting angst-ridden teenagers to form their army. Obviously, Shredder and his Foot clan have fallen on desperate times.The first movie in the original Ninja Turtle trilogy was nowhere near as corny as the sequels that followed, and for that I respect it. The action and martial arts were pretty good for a movie aimed at kids with men in giant foam rubber turtle suits. Also, I must admit this is probably my favorite puppeteer work to come from the Jim Henson's Creature Shop. The movie is filled with humor for both kids and adults; I didn't realize how many jokes/one-liners I hadn't caught as a nine-year-old when I first saw this movie. The human element in the movie provides a worthy supporting performance. The Shredder doesn't receive a great deal of screen time but is brooding enough in the time he IS given. Judith Hoag was a great April O'Neal but my favorite supporting character was Casey Jones (played by Elias Koteas) for his slacker demeanor and amusing interactions with the turtles. I also thought it was cool to spot Sam Rockwell in a bit part as one of the thugs in Shredder's warehouse as one of his earliest big screen roles.The first Ninja Turtles movie is easily one of my favorite kid movies. Even years later, I'm still able to sit down and enjoy this flick; I'm still hoping my daughter will embrace the franchise just as I did. I've seen this movie a good handful of times and it still hasn't gotten stale. Get over the fact that you're watching a movie with men in foam turtle suits and enjoy the wisecracks and martial arts action of a classic family film from the start of the 90's. If you get bored, feel free to count the numerous product placement instances throughout the movie. Hmm...you think Dominos had a hand in getting this movie made...?

The four main characters are sufficiently described by the title; they are teenage mutant ninja turtles, transformed into such by toxic ooze that seeped into the sewer, where turtles apparently live. They were adopted rather haphazardly by a very intelligent rat, who happened to be a ninja master even before he was also transformed by his contact with the ooze. Now they all fight crime in New York and eat pizza as often as possible.If you weren't an 8 year old at the time, this movie would sound like a train wreck. Nine times out of ten those feelings would be correct, but somehow this film turned out to be extraordinarily good given the profound odds against it.TMNT is surprisingly well-crafted from beginning to end. The pacing is spot-on, the characters are distinctive and surprisingly believable, the acting is above average and the direction here is a superb compliment to the plot that unfolds. And speaking of plot, the story manages to tell itself in a compelling fashion, and actually keeps your interest in an otherwise mundane storyline, thanks to the uniquely forlorn tone and deeply interesting characters.The fight choreography here isn't the greatest you've ever seen, but it is far above passable, and there are a few fight sequences that are still quite a thrill for me to watch even as an adult, nearly two decades later.The success of this film depended heavily on the costumes and set pieces, which were all near-perfect, and greatly helped the overwhelmingly ridiculous plot ring true. Shredder managed to look like a real tough fella, without looking too goofy (much of that is thanks to James Saito's brooding performance). The turtles all looked like, well, giant turtles. It's quite easy to forget that these are actually stunt men in suits from time to time, and a little piece of me dies inside every time I force myself back to that reality while watching this film. Even Splinter, which was nothing more than a giant skinny rat puppet, was completely convincing as a giant talking rat ninja master.Elias Koteas as Casey Jones is a perfect fit, and he managed to give this film a lot of it's edge. He's the true fearless crusader of the bunch, and a perfect counterpart for April who was also portrayed exceptionally well by Judith Hoag. Their interactions together were some of my favorite scenes in the film, and added a much-needed human element to the story.This is the true definition of a children's' film that adults can enjoy too. There's even a little off-color humor here that I did not understand as a child but greatly appreciate as an adult. I wouldn't say there's anything inappropriate for a child in this film, but you will be surprised at how evolved and dry some of the humor is. I can think of at least four different exchanges that still make me laugh audibly, which is more than I can say for many comedies that are churned out today.If you weren't a fan of the comics, and your exposure to this universe is limited to the cartoon or the two sequels, then you will likely be surprised by the tone of this film. It's not as cartoonish as you would expect, and takes a far more serious approach to this story than it's other iterations (at least comparatively) which had strayed a fair amount from the source material in those terms. This movie feels dark and dirty most of the time, which is both fitting and necessary since we're following characters who live in a sewer. The turtles' home could use some tidying up, and even the above-ground scenes are damp and cold. With the exception of one act that takes place at a farm house, there's hardly a sunny day in sight throughout the entire film, and this helps to create a darker, more serious mood than most children's' movies even of similar genres or themes.However, the characters here are very animated and jovial for the most part, which helps to counterbalance the atmosphere and keep this a fun adventure story with a lot of heart. They all joke with each other at every opportunity, and it's downright adorable at times to watch them interact.If you haven't seen this film since you were a kid, it's definitely time for a revisit. You'll be pleasantly surprised at how well it holds up, and you'll likely find a new appreciation for the movie.Even if you're completely new to the world of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, I encourage everyone of all ages to give this movie a viewing, taking it in for what it is. Accept it's faults and embrace it's beauties. Remind yourself that this is a movie about giant talking ninja turtles, and let it turn you into an 8 year old again for 93 minutes. No matter how old you are, you'll be smiling from ear to ear by the time the credits start to roll.

He also has worked on loads of kung-fu actioners over the years, some forgettable, some great.Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles The Movie falls into the great category. Elevated above other easily forgotten movies of the early 90's by it's cool direction, neat cast and nicely rounded script (Elias Koteas in one of his first roles, fantastic as the vigilante Casey Jones - most recently he's been in David Fincher's Zodiac, and he played the doomed designer of SimONE in the Al Pacino film of the same name).Two things that, IMO, cannot go without a decent mention here. Raphael, always my favourite turtle (heck, check him out in the new CG film TMNT), is typically awesome here as the brash loner who acts without thinking. His scene with Splinter, in which the rat-sensai counsels him on his anger, is amazingly touching considering you are watching a puppet and a guy in a rubber turtle suit! From first seeing this in theatres in 1990-91, to this day i have never forgot Splinters words, that rang so true to me then and still resonate now. He tells Raph that if he doesn't confront his anger, it will become an unconquerable enemy.The other thing is Jim Henson's puppets (his son Brian was the chief puppeteer and assistant director on this film), and the guys in the turtle suits who managed to pull off some fairly decent martial arts work while wearing i think it was 50-80 lbs of foam rubber turtle! Amazing, and the facial expressions the turtle suits are capable of was WAY ahead of its time here.Another thing, lastly, is the similarities this story has to old samurai legends I have read and heard, particularly one in which a warlord takes control of a whole community and four brothers and apprentice samurai avenge the death of their master and in doing so, free the community.The messages about being strong together, and the bonds of family are great, the humour is laugh out loud (like the scene where Mikey is contemplatively gazing at the moon, and Donatello comes up to him and you are expecting something deep, but Mikey just goes Pizza dude's got 30 seconds..., and Raph's great line when facing down the evil Foot Clan single-handedly You guys must be studying the ABRIDGED book of ninja fighting!) I'm sure I'm not alone in loving this film, and maybe this stuff has all been said before but i just had to add my approval and high rating to this neglected little gem. I'll never forget wearing out my (green!) VHS tape as a kid, and then challenging all my mates oooh, a fellow chucker, eh??!. It was the best.So get a pizza (i keep meaning to put subtitles on and get the exact same pizza Mikey orders at the start of the movie hehe), and kick back with the dudes to re-experience the film that KICK-STARTED the 90's for a generation of kids who still knew what it meant to be called in before the sun goes down.

Judith Hoag made a fine April, and Elias Koteas made the perfect tough-guy Casey Jones. My favorite of the turtles (being Raphael) was well depicted, if you consider his hothead attitude. Josh Pais supplies his pushy, loudmouth New Yorker accent that fits his personality perfectly. Robbie Rist gives a great surfer voice to Michelangelo, Corey Feldman gives that nerdy voice to Donatello and Brian Tochi makes a fine Leonardo. All of their voices fit the roles of the turtles quite well.And for the story, I'm glad that they followed the storyline of the comic book rather than the cartoon, mainly since it seems weird to have Splinter be a man that turned into a rat as opposed to a pet of his master which mutated along with the turtles.I still love this movie after seeing it for the first time in 10 years, and it is the best in the TMNT trilogy. In the end, this movie has revived my love for the turtles, and I look forward to future TMNT productions with their triumphant return.10/10 "}{"Title":"STILL the best comic book adaptation to film...","Date":"8 June 2002","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":"  I'm the biggest Spider-Man fan this side of the mississip, but TMNT is still the best comic book to film flick ever made.

But the magic's still there, that's for sure. Just take a look at TMNT I. This movie for me represents what the TMNT should always have been. First off, Jim Henson's CS did a more than excellent job with the costumes. The script managed to successfully merge comic book/cartoon aspects. The casting was wonderful. And the *atmosphere* of this movie! It's sometimes dark, sometimes light, but never too much of either. Which is,  what makes it work so well.The incredible weirdness of four walking, talking Turtles trained in martial arts by a mutated rat is perfectly balanced by the realistic setting, one of the aspects that really sets this movie apart from others. It's dark but light, fantastic but yet oh so real... And the Turtles... man, do they get to you. They're not rich or all-powerful super heroes out to save the world from ridiculous villains. They're simply four kids doing their very best (remember their broken old TV?) to live their lives as normally as it is for them possible, being forced to hide forever in the city sewers and inheriting a violent past of death and honour and revenge that came with having Splinter as a mentor. A struggle. Which for me --now that I'm more analytic-- is a downright poignant situation, because you see these four teenagers act still rather innocent, rather naive and hopeful of the world (as all teenagers do!), and at least I for one wonder And after that?It's so cool to see how Splinter talks to Raphael after he comes back from the movies. The father-son theme comes up quite often, and there are a couple good lessons about family and love.There are so many great things about this movie... so much humanity is infused to the main characters. It's got its flaws, obviously, but the good stuff outweighs the bad by a long shot, and the cheese is cut down to a healthy minimum. This movie definitely appeals to an older audience, and it's indeed a lot of fun. And if you love it and wish there was more of it, I suggest you read the Mirage comics that the story arc was picked up from. Believe me, chances are you'll become a born-again fan.The Turtles were a big chunk of our childhood and will forever remain a big, big part of my life. Thanks, Kevin E. and Peter L.! Long live the TMNT!

Of course the ninja turtles will do everything to stop him....This was one of those films that when released, I was the right demographic and age to really appreciate the phenomenon, and wise enough about films to also appreciate the poor quality of the sequels.The film isn't perfect, and really, the only other comic book movie around at the time was Batman, Dick Tracey has been released, but that was a vanity project, this had a whole network of kids baying for it, thanks to the advent of Mass marketing.It's fun to watch, the cast other than Koteas are not very good, but the Henson workshop have done wonders with the titular characters. For the budget, it was everything a thirteen year old boy could have imagined what a real life Turle would look like.And the other reason why it was so successful, it was violent and didn't sissy around with fights or near death experiences, it was dark and gritty, and any teenage boys would have lapped this up,because they were already on a diet of Schwarzeneggar and Van Damme, thanks to their dad.Age hasn't been kind to the film, even though the turtles still look great, the rest of the film just looks dated and all frizzy hair and suits, like the nineties is trying to rid itself of the eighties.For nostalgia purposes, it's fun to watch.

My brother got a copy off a friend before it was in the cinema and it had all the scenes that were cut from the UK version (now seen in the DVD release) and the original ending. I later owned the cut UK version. I loved both versions, just as I loved the cartoon.Last night I watched it with my nephew, a huge ninja turtles fan. I asked my sister if she minded him watching it, because he is young, but she said he'd be fine and I went through it with him before, telling him it's not real, they don't really kick each other etc. Just as I thought, he loved the film as much as I did when I first saw it. Having grown up watching Sesame Street and Rainbow, when I first saw the film I couldn't believe that there were actually turtles fighting on the screen in front of my very eyes, but I guess to my nephew it wasn't quite such a big deal. You don't even see the first fight scene (it's in the dark) and this is very deliberate, because at the time the director must've known that people would want to see the turtles, they'd want to see how they looked. When they do appear it's no disappointment! These effects are great and if I've said it once then I've said it a million times; a guy in a well made suit with time and care put in looks a billion times better than some useless CGI character designed by some company that are only in it for the money. Compare Ja Ja Binks with one of the turtles and you'll see the turtles look more real, because they're actually there and the light that is on them is real, the shadows are real - it looks believable. A lot of time and effort has gone into making their skin look just right and it shows. I've seen a lot of comments about lip-synching etc. It's a minor point, deal with it. I think it's only even noticeable in about two or three scenes and even then it isn't that bad.My nephew was totally blown away by it. He loved the jokes, the fighting and I didn't hear any bad language (damn is only considered offensive if you're extremely religious). Anyone on here who slates the soundtrack is clearly on another planet. It was made in 1990! Listen to other music of the time - it's electronic, it's sharp, concise and it pulls no punches. I like the soundtrack, always have. It does what it's meant to. I'm sure people will look back on the 'urban'/'r&b' soundtracks to current releases in years to come and laugh at them (although I personally believe they should, because it isn't to my taste).I've read a number of extremely positive reviews and a number of extremely negative reviews. I want to give it 10 because I'm certain that 5.9 isn't a fair reflection of the movie. I should give it 9.95 (if you know and enjoyed the movie, you'll appreciate that). Instead I've given it 8/10, which deep down is what I think it deserves. It's a great film that can be enjoyed by children and adults alike, the fight scenes are great, the camera work is needlessly good (they could've got away with much less effort), there's comedy, drama etc. It really is so much better than a lot of the CGI super hero movies out today and it's a shame that the sequels were so poor.

Unfortunately, Henson died from pneumonia-related organ failure around this time. Also critics made the film out to be 'utter, utter garbage' because the Turtles were climbing to the third most popular toy franchise on earth, so the idea of a movie would likely be received as more of the mindless cash-in that had followed the Turtles forgettable transition to Saturday morning cartoon, and the toy shops.The movie does have its own aesthetic though. Sort of. It imitates Tim Burton's Batman grunge noir and has its own funky, retro style lifted from downtown second hand stores, chipped and crumbling apartment buildings and the original black and white comic book panels.Several key scenes of comic action are well set up and the films impact and tone are excellent here. The MAIN PROBLEM with the TMNT film is that, essentially, it has no plot whatsoever.Raphael (the red mask version) gets hit on the head during a battle sequence and literally spends the ENTIRE SECOND ACT asleep in a bathtub somewhere on a farm location (cheap and easy to shoot, but not really motivating in any way plotwise). The other turtles just sort of do turtle stuff and there's also two scenes dealing with April O'Neil's possible attraction to ruffian vigilante Casey Jones. So . . .after nothing happens during 'act II' (you know, the bit where the plot's supposed to kick in), the Turtles basically head back to Noo Yoik City to have more zany action comedy scenes, followed by a generic action pic ending.IF ONLY they'd thought of a cool plot device or some real character development to give this picture some plausible reason for existing, it'd be a semi-classic kids film.For some reason, like Burton's Batman picture of 1989, key scenes of staging and cinematography are striking for what is essentially a genre picture, but the film sucks. Followed by a sequel where parents had protested against the action comedy sequences in the original, then toilet quality Michael Bay monster pics years later. There's an all-CGI version out there too, missed by most.

Along with Robin Hood Prince of Thieves (RIP Alan Rickman), this was one of the films I watched obsessively as a child. The VHS came coloured green and I liked it oh so much better than the cartoons. This movie made me a fan of Elias Koteas. That's right my watching The Prophecy, Fallen and Thin Red Line all started here. This was the first movie soundtrack I owned and I listened to it repeatedly, going into random, and usually unwanted, renditions of 9.95 and MC Hammer's This is What we Do. Watching this movie for me is like having a wave of nostalgia washing over me, every line of dialogue in every scene is like meeting up with an old friend. After my first wife died I lived with a flat mate who was equally obsessed with it growing up. We could re-enact every line of dialogue in the film.The movie introduces us to a dark New York City, being vandalized by an increasingly large ninja Klan known as The Foot, led by the mysterious Shredder. We get a nice montage showing just how widespread and organized their crime wave is as journalist April O'Neal (Judith Hoag) reports these happenings on the news. April's attempts to expose The Foot Clan draws their ire and the Turtles come to protect her as the baddies attack, kicking their asses. But Raphael loses a Si, but don't worry, it ain't gone. He CAN GET IT BACK man! Raphael is the brooding loner of the group and decides to go to the movies (Critters 3, Leonardo DiCaprio's first movie) where he is unimpressed with what he sees, but ends up meeting a vigilante Casey Jones (Elias Koteas) and getting his ass kicked by him after revealing he doesn't understand either crumpets or cricket, two of the best things in life. Raph then gets his Si back after saving April from another Foot Clan attack and he's forced to take her back to their sewer hide out where Splinter can reveal their backstory. The Turtles go to check out April's house where The Foot attack again. Raphael gets severely wounded during the attack while at the same time the hideout is ravaged by The Foot and Splinter kidnapped and tortured. This leaves the Turtles to escape into the country along with April and Casey and train themselves up for the final showdown with Shredder.OK, I can see flaws in the story, but really, it satisfies me on just about every level. The Turtle puppets are reasonably convincing and mainly kept in darkness. The main cast put around them are all adequate at worst, and Hoag and Koteas are both good. We also have a young Sam Rockwell on screen for a couple of scenes as one of the Foot leaders. The film flows effortlessly from scene to scene and never feels slow or bogged down. It just rollicks along at a good clip, mixing fun, action and some nice messages for the kids. I've heard people say it's too dark, but it never bothered me either visually or in terms of atmosphere.In the end, I can't view this objectively, no matter how hard I try. This is more than a movie, it's an old friend, and like any friend, you accept it faults and all. That old, worn green VHS that gave me hours of enjoyment as a youngster and is still worthwhile more than 25 years later. That's a rare type of connection that only films can give us, and the reason we continue to love movies well into our dotage. "},{"Title":"Tonight, I dine on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie soup.

It would, nearly impossible to film that, in the early 1990s, but somehow, director Steve Barron was able to. I'm shell-shocked, how well-made, this movie was. While, this movie isn't based off the popular late 1980s /early 1990s children cartoon TV series by Fred Wolf; it still has that T.U.R.T.L.E power! You really do see, some elements from the cartoon, being used here. I like how, all the turtles have different color scheme and personalities. I also love the turtle's sense of humor and their love of pizza. However, I like more, the fact, that this movie was mostly an adaptation of Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird's original comic. It gave, the movie, so much more mature complexity within its simple, child-like story-telling. I like the darker, gritty, and more violent tone. Don't get me wrong, the movie is still funny and lighthearted like the cartoon series, but there are some really strong themes, here, that far outlives its sequels. The movie feels like it's about fatherhood and family. You really get the sense of that, when the turtles Leonardo (Voiced by Brian Tochi), Donatello (Voiced by Corey Feldman), Michelangelo (Voiced by Robbie Rist), & Raphael (Voiced by Josh Pais), must save their mutant rat, father figure Master Splinter (Voiced by Kevin Clash) from the evil Shredder (Voiced by David McCharen), because they truly do love each other. You really feel the heart-break, the turtles are feeling, in Master Splinter's absence. The movie get really emotional, toward the middle at the barn, and it's by far, the best tear-jerking moment in the film. You really do sense that they truly do love each other. You also get to see the abusive/dysfunctional side of fatherhood, in this movie, as well. Mostly in the scenes between Shredder and his foot-soldiers. While, it's clear to us, that Shredder use misguided teenagers, to commit crimes for his own personal gain. To those, who choose to follow him; they see him, as a father-figure, who gave a sense of self-worth, and personal freedom. This is why, Danny Pennington (Michael Turney) chose to follow him, over his real-life father, Charles (Jay Patterson). While, personally, I didn't like the Penningtons at all, because how annoying, they were. I understand, why both of them was needed for this story. After all, there has to be a connection, between the turtles and side-character, April O'Neal (Judith Hoag).For the most part, I like, how the story is told. However, not everything in the comics, made a good idea, toward the film. First off, I didn't like, that Master Splinter was a pet, rather than being Hamato Yoshi. Seeing Splinter do karate moves in a small cage in the flashbacks is hilarious, unrealistic and somewhat dated. Another problem in the film is how the film, lack's exposition for the toxic waste that mutated them. I was really, hoping for the ooze to play, more into the script. The last is the anti-climax showdown, between Master Splinter and Shredder. What a big let-down! I know, robotics was in its early stages, but couldn't they do, something to make it, seem like, they're fighting. However, the costumes provided for the eponymous heroes, as well as puppetry for Splinter and the turtles as young mutants, were provided by Jim Henson's Creature Shop was somewhat impressive. The advanced animatronics used here, were top-notch. Still, there were some creepy goofs. The most notorious one, is when Donnie laughs and you can see the actor's face in the turtle's mouth. I do like, that the actors in the turtles costumes (David Forman - Leonardo/ Josh Pais &#x96; Raphael/ Leif Tilden-Donatello/ & Michelan Sisti-Michelangelo) also appear unmasked, as different characters, throughout the film. The film's worth checking out for that, alone. Another one, worth checking out is a young Sam Rockwell as a thug. Listen to what he says, it's a really cool, reference. So, look out for him! One actor, that I didn't like, in the film, was Judith Hoag. She was way, too whiny. I really didn't like, her version of April O'Neal. Glad, she got replace in the sequels. However, the actor that play former hockey player turn street vigilante Casey Jones, Elias Koteas, was well-fit for this role. I'm really happy, he return, for one of the sequels. One thing, that didn't return, much in the sequels, is the abundant martial arts weapons violence. In the sequels, the turtles used less and less, of their deadly weapons, and more kicks and punches. I guess, martial arts weapons caused so much controversy at the time that, in Britain this family film was actually censored from children. I'm glad, people, today, really saw, how silly, it was, to try to ban this movie, and allow it to play, within, much changes. After all, this kid-friendly martial arts flick is pretty tame, compare to today's ninja movies. Anyways, the movie pacing is pretty good, lots of action pack moments, mixed well with the dramatic side. Another thing, I love, about this film is the music. Composer John Du Prez did a great job for the theme. It was totally tubular! Partners in Kryme's song, 'T.U.R.T.LE Power' was also my jam! It was so radical! So, much better than the Ninja Rap from the second movie 1991's Secret of the Ooze. This movie is a lot better, than 1993's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III, as well. In the 2000s, the series search new audiences with another animation film in 2007, however, it fail to gain, a new following. This attempt is then follow by two reboot animation TV shows in 2003 and 2012. In 2014, a live-action reboot was made. It also fell to meet, fans demands. Overall This 1990 movie is one of the most successful independent film ever made. It's gnarly! Hellacious & most of all! Cowbunga! It's my favorite TMNT movie, so far.

They are the hidden heroes that live in the sewer but come out to fight a local gang called the Foot. The leader of the foot is the main bad guy and his name is Shredder. And the turtles are on a mission to save Splinter as he has been kidnapped by the Foot.The story is actually not that bad. It is quite good. This is a kids film really so there is a mixture of comedy and action all the way through the film. There was also a bit if drama too.Because this film is quite old now, the effects were not computer generated like they would be now. There were 4 guys dressed up in giant rubber costumes. Because of this you have to give them a little credit for the movement they had during the fighting scenes. They were not great. The fighting scenes were generally bad to be honest, but seeing as they were all dressed in those costumes you can forgive that. I also can't really comment on their acting. How can anyone act in a giant rubber suit? The actors in the costumes were David Forman, Michelan Sisti, Leif Tilden & Josh Pais. Other actors in the film were Judith Hoag as April O'Neil and Elias Koteas as Casey Jones. Judith was OK, but there were moments where she really was not good. I thought she was very average. Elias was the best actor in the movie. I liked the character and he did a great job playing him out. The only other famous name was the voice artist of Donatello. Corey Feldman was the famous voice.The drama that I mentioned before was very hard to connect to. It is not easy to feel sorry for a giant rubber costume. So when you see the turtles really sad and upset, I struggled to feel sorry for them.The thing I love most about this film is it has an classic 80's/90's feel to it. It brought back a lot of memories watching this and even though it was not great, it was a lot of fun. If I had never seen it as a kid, I probably would have thought it was really bad... but due to the memories it made it a great, fun watch.I will give this film 7 out of 10.You're a claustrophobic.You want a fist in the mouth?

Death is a very real and constant subject in this 'kids film' right up to the end. Life can be scary, difficult, painful, and out right unfair, and the movie dose not shy away from that. That is something that few movies in the early 90s and even today geared toward kids are good about doing due to society's fear of discussing loss and death in general.I also see this film getting fairly bad scores for some reason and I don't get that. It was made when CG would not exist as even a half viable option for movies for at least a year or two, and anamatronics where still rather primitive compared to what is in Hollywood today.For its time, the cinematography and special creature effects where awesome.

I basically recall of how much I absolutely adored all four of the Ninja Turtles and their cool Ninja martial arts master, Splinter! I am 25-years-old now and after seeing this movie again with my little sisters now presently in this year of 2010, I not only believe but am now completely, utterly sure that Splinter is not just my favorite character of the TMNTs, but that I watch them for the sake of Splinter. Splinter is wise, stern yet affectionate, has a quiet, mellow sense of humor, and a unique aura of nobility, dignity, and masterful sense of self-esteem. The facts of the story and plot that present to their audience the idea that Splinter basically self-taught himself about Ninjitsu by mimicking his master indicate that he was quite an exceptional rat even before he came into contact with the glowing green ooze that completely changed all five of them to the upright-walking, talking creatures that they became. The TMNTs were unique in their own way, too. But Splinter shines as their mentor that taught it all to them and without him there would be no story of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles nor any gray matter to the plot. Long live Splinter!!! Splinter rules!!!!

I watched the cartoon every weekday evening, I owned everything from bed sheets to t-shirts, and I had more action figures than anyone else I knew. So when I had the chance to see a live action film in the theater, to say that I was excited is a huge understatement.This movie is everything that it should have been and much, much more. When I say more, I really mean it. How easy would it have been to make a straight forward movie of Ninja Turtles versus the Foot Clan? That would have made for a satisfactory movie for any Turtle's fan, but instead they took it a more creative route and made a compelling story that just blew me away. With Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles you get to see the inside workings of the Foot Clan. You get the wisdom of Splinter, and the emotion of the turtles when he is taken. You also get great fight scenes with a lot of action and turtle antics throughout. The final fight with Shredder is epic. There is no music playing and you can feel how the turtles are in loads of trouble. This movie is a little darker image of the Turtles compared to the cartoon and shows there story from a bit of a different perspective, but it is a very cool one and it works on every single level. It's a shame movies like this are not made anymore. I will never understand why that is.

Got that? Okay, the turtles are all named after famous Renaissance painters (Donatello, Michaelangelo, Leonardo and Raphael) and they end up getting involved with a news reporter named April O'Neil (played rather blandly by Judith Hoag). There's also a pleasant vigilante who ends up lending a helping hand and his name is Casey Jones (played with exuberance by the great Elias Koteas). Still with me? There's an evil big baddie named Shredder, who has his army of teenaged martial artists (called, rather unscarily, The Foot Clan) and who wants the turtles out of the picture.I think that covers all of the details, however ridiculous they seem. Basically, this movie takes a very popular franchise of the time (originally in graphic novel form and then made into a hugely popular children's cartoon) and packages it into an enjoyable movie for the masses. It's about men in rubber turtle suits pulling off some impressive fight moves while talking like surfer dudes and that's really all there is to it. You may hate it but it's hard to totally loathe and I was surprised by how much affection I found I had for this little movie.For those who weren't there at the time there are still plenty of little things to enjoy, from the dated lingo to a small appearance from a pre-big time Sam Rockwell. For those who were there then it's a mixture of fun, nostalgia and simple pleasures. Okay, this is yet another movie that will win no awards but it's very much of it's time and actually does rather well at giving the shelled heroes enough to do in the action department while not scaring off the kiddies. There is nothing really too praiseworthy in the technical side of things (the script never really rises above cowabunga while none of the shots stand out as classics in the field of action cinema) but it does enough to get by.See this if you like Double Dragon, Super Mario Bros, Tank Girl.

It was grounded in a mixture of my fascination with creature special effects, animatronics, along with models and other fantasy beings, after seeing films or programs on TV such as Star Wars, Star Trek, Dinosaurs, Labyrinth, Willow, and a little later Time Bandits and The Thing. I claimed I'd become a model or creature maker for movies. I'm not, but that's not important. I'm young yet, and may still pursue that one of many dreams.I remember knowing a great deal about the world of the turtles, with all their fighting capabilities etc. It was a major talking point among my male friends. Later I even had a latex turtle arm I begged a friend to give to me. It was a reject from his uncle who worked in the design studio. I wore it around my local Scottish neighbourhood. It was only 1 arm mind. Funny stuff.Then it came time to see the movie in the cinema. I don't remember whether I saw it with my friend or my mother, or both. I was amazed by how they got the faces to move on the turtle characters and impressed by the actors moving so well in all that latex. I saw some fantastic documentaries on TV at the time about how it was all done. However, even at that age, I began to recognise how atrocious the acting was. I haven't seen the film since, so I can't have been influenced again.It was a fun time in my life, and I thank the creators for influencing that, but ultimately it was myself and my friends who created the great memories and not the film.

Although not a comics fan and only being six when this film came out, I can say it definitely shares the original dark themes and lightness of turtles perfectly.The story is as plausible as it can get about mutated, Ninja fighting turtles. The Turtles love of pizza in this film is not put on overkill. Also the jokes are not overdone and we really get to see character growth and a family connection with the turtles and splinter.The suits in my opinion still hold up. Yes, they have aged with what's available today, but for 1990 they look incredible.The fight scenes are very well done, although some scenes are quite violent to stay more true to the original vision, it's certainly not too violent, or to kid friendly. And what they accomplished in those suits is remarkable and the people inside of them should be given more credit.My only complaint is the film is a little short. And from what I understand there are deleted scenes which could have developed more into the story and were taken out. Hopefully one day these scenes will either be included in a directors cut DVD, or at the very least as viewable deleted scenes on a DVD or blue ray.If your children like the new show/old toon or anything turtles I recommend this film. And for adults, I recommend this too. It's not really a children's movie.10/10 for me.

Then there was the toys, the blankets, the merchandise and the school play I once performed as one of the turtles.Leonardo (blue), Michaelangelo (orange), Donatello (purple) and Raphael (red) have their own movie now and I'm happy to review that it's still the best one of the trilogy.Crime is rampant in New York where muggings, murder, robbery, kidnapping, gangs, drugs and everything bad is up in the state. By the time the cops arrive it's too late! April O' Neil (Judith Hoag) believes that the police or anybody else isn't doing their job almost leaving her boss to fire her until one night she encounters a group of thugs known as the foot soldiers before getting attacked. That's when the turtles save her for the first time until a second encounter in a train station when Raphael saves April and takes her back to the sewer before she gets freaked out on her heroes along with their mentor Splinter, a rat. April realizes that not only can the turtles fight, but they along with their mentor can walk and talk like humans. So she befriends them and knows everything about how they were born and Splinter's enemy, Shredder, who is the kingpin of the youth gang where April's boss has a son who secretly joins in before the enemy finds out where the turtles live. The turtles also encounter the wild and cool Casey Jones (Elias Koteas) who wears a hockey mask and carries many hockey and golf sticks when taking on enemies. He becomes an aid to the turtles along with having a thing for April where if you read the comics or watched the show, Casey kicks butt.Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is true to the fans just like the comics and television show were. And it's still one of a kind. "},{"Title":"Great movie, the best of the Ninja Turtles","Date":"16 February 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":" There's certain movies that seem to automatically get bad criticism because of their titles and subject. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is one of them. Now, many people like the Ninja Turtles, but most seem to think it's childish and not worth their time. This is so not true, and the first movie, obviously titled Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, makes this evident.The movie tells the story of four mutant turtles trained by their rat master Splinter. Splinter learned the art of ninjistu from his owner back in Japan. When Splinter came to America he found the four turtles in a sewer. The turtles were mutated by some ooze and Splinter was too. He eventually taught them to be ninjas so he could take revenge on the man who killed his master, Oroko Saki, or, The Shredder.Okay, I'll admit, even as I wrote that it sounded far-fetched(but so unique), but the film takes this story and brings it down(under?) to Earth and makes it very believable. All the characters are written well, their stories are rich and interesting, and their development during the film is one of its strongest points. It's obvious there's tension among the brothers, they live in an enclosed sewer and they are usually aching to fight. This is played out well within the film. April and Casey are also well written.There's so much good to say about this film, and even though it has its flaws they are FAR overshadowed. The cinematography is gritty and just amazing. The sets are flawlessly crafted, it really feels like a cramped makeshift home down in the sewer, and New York City feels like an American city, not some glossy representation of one. The scenes on April's farm are so well shot...it's breathtaking to me. It's great to just take in all the detail.One source of criticism seems to be the dialog, and frankly, you either like it or you don't. I fall into the former group, these turtles feel like four teenage brothers and even though some of it's cheesy, the dialog never really gets cringe-worthy, so it's all good. The acting is also great, the four turtles voices are quirky and fun, and the human actors deliver raw and just plain realistic performances. April's reaction to the turtles is especially realistic, she has to portray so many emotions at once, and she pulls it off perfectly.The puppetry is top-notch, it's obvious Jim Henson was the master at this stuff, the detail on the turtles and the way there mouths move make it so much better. Just look at the muscles on their legs...perfect. The fighting choreography is great, it's obvious that there's limitations in using turtles in suits to portray ninjas, but the filmmakers got past that and made the action effective and interesting.I love the score/soundtrack. It is really interesting, and the MC Hammer stuff is actually good. There's some subtle stuff that carries enough emotion to move us when it needs to. The direction is also really worth noting, and it's obvious the makers of this film really went far to please the fans, because it combines the best of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the gritty realisticness that made the comics great, and the fun dialog and humor that made the 80s show fun.9/10 "},{"Title":"Groundbreaking cinema achievement!","Date":"6 August 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":" While todays moviegoers are content, for some reason, to watch films with gratuitous CG that is quite often terribly executed (King Kong anyone?)but seem to think that films with great prosthetics are so yesterday.TMNT THE MOVIE shows how superior good costumes and prosthetics are far superior to CG, the Turtle costumes are great, the faces are fantastically designed to give a full variety of expressions without being so over the top (like the predator in AVP who had far too much movement in it's face), add on to that the brilliant acting of the people in the suites, and the awesome voice acting when all put together deliver a deep sense of character and uniqueness for each of the turtles.The plot, some have criticized as being too simple, however sometimes simple is better than a plot that ends up being confusing as it tries to be complex. The plot goes like this, in NYC a silent crime wave has hit, there are no witnesses and the crimes are escalating from simple pick pockets to whole trucks of goods being stolen. The group responsible is the FOOT, a group of ninja thieves headed by the SHREDDER. A good simple plot, which the main characters become involved in when they intervene in one of the FOOT's crimes which happened to be trying to silence reporter April O'Neil who knows too much about the FOOT than they care for her to know.I won't say more just in case the reader hasn't seen this film yet. It is dark, not as violent as the comics, but the comics being aimed at an adult audience and the TV show aimed at children the Movie had to strike a balance between both and I think it did, while avoiding the bloodshed in the comics, the themes and characters are relate able to adult audiences without being cheesy. While some of the slang and street talk may not catch on very quickly with a modern younger audience but that is due to the time of when the film was made and the modern day, but it doesn't lack in cool factor. I only wish the sequels were as good, and that more modern films will take lessons from this film in how to incorporate a good story and good characters with heavy special effects be they CG, animatronic or prosthetics.

Shadowy figures lock in combat in the darkness behind her.When the police arrive, they find April dazed but unharmed, with her assailants neatly tied up around her. Inside the sewers of New York, April's rescuers are revealed Raphael, Leonardo, Michaelangelo, and Donatello - the illustrious Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - who have returned to their subterranean den to report to their ninja master an aging, four-foot tall talking rat named Splinter. After some pizza, the tempestuous Raphael goes to Central Park and gets into a fight with Casey Jones (Elias Koteas), a self-appointed vigilante who wields a variety of sports implements as weapons. A martial-arts athlete, Casey announces to himself that it is time to go into the dangerous, criminal world of the streets and save New York. Somebody's gotta do it! he says. Meanwhile, the silent crimes continue to escalate, despite April's prodding of ineffective police chief Ross Sterns (Raymond Serra) to clean up the city. April does manage to incite the group responsible for the crimes a clandestine organization known as The Foot, which attacks her again, this time in the subway. Again, the heroic Raphael saves her.This time, however, he brings her to the Turtles' sewer den. Here, Splinter and his Turtles tell the spooked April the story of their origin, which involves a sewer encounter with radioactive ooze that caused them to grow to the size of men and gave them the gift of speech. As the Turtles escort April to her apartment, Splinter is rat-napped by The Foot.After the TMNT return home and find their Sensei missing, the heartbroken and confused Turtles return to April's apartment, while The Foot takes Splinter to its headquarters a huge warehouse that is a cross between Pinocchio's Pleasure Island and a ninja Fagin's Lair. It is here that The Shredder builds his empire, using an army of ninja-trained teenagers as his thieves. One of these is Danny Pennington, the estranged son of April's boss, and Danny tips The Shredder off as to where the troublesome Turtles are. Armed with this knowledge, The Foot launches an all-out attack, demolishing April's apartment in a knock-down, drag-out battle as she, the Turtles and Casey Jones (always on the lookout for a good fight, but overwhelmed by numbers this time) all flee. The heroes arrive at April's childhood home in the country, where the somber Turtles deal with their defeat, each in his own way. In the calm serenity of the countryside Casey and April discover each other. The Turtles now discover, through a mystical communique with their still-imprisoned Master Splinter, that the true ninja is not of the body, but of the mind. Accordingly, they all begin to retrain and hone their ninja abilities.With their new knowledge and skills, the Turtles return to the city. While Casey manages to rescue Splinter with Danny's help, the Turtles engage in their final battle with The Foot - in the sewers, on the streets and upon rooftops. The battle climaxes with Splinter defeating The Shredder, who is revealed to be the assassin of Splinter's own ninja master. New York is saved, and the Turtles are reunited with their father.Ohhh the good old days. Back when movies were so bad, but no we didn't care. Or at least the ones who counted. Us little kids.

A great guilty pleasure. Now while, it's no Godfather, it's a cult classic in it's own right. Ninja Turtle movies aren't in no way shape or form a perfect film series. But I can't see how they could done any better. Other than the 3rd. I can't remember ever liking it. The second is just pure dumb fun. Still a great movie. But the first seems to be the best in the series. It's pretty hard to take these movies seriously. That's one problem.The Ninja Turtles were at one point graphic in terms of violence. Decapitations, cutting of limbs etc. But suddenly, it was tone done. That sucked. Ninja Turtles still remained very cool, but the violence was part of it's charm I guess. Now it seems with the newer comic books coming out, the violence is returning for the most part.

Now, with a recent live-action TV series, repeats of the old animated cartoon along with a brand new animated series, the Turtles (created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird) are experiencing a mini-revival. Their pizza-chomping, kung-fu antics look set to enthrall a new generation of fans.With this in mind, it seems appropriate to go back and review the first movie instalment with these high-kicking amphibians.  It is certainly noteworthy for possessing a serious streak missing from its cartoon-like sequels.  This is the film's strength but is also it's chief weakness, as it never seems to know how to deal with the universal themes (the concept of family, teenage delinquency) inherent in its story.The plot is nothing really spectacular, but is original enough not to be a bore.  A mysterious crime-wave has hit New York City, with random and untraceable thefts taking place on the streets.  The intimidating but ultimately ineffectual Police Chief (Raymond Serra) is powerless to do anything about it.  He is harried repeatedly by investigative reporter April O'Neil (Judith Hoag), who suspects the villainy to be the work of the Foot Clan, a band of Japanese ninja thieves.  This is indeed the case, and the organization's ruthless overlord, the Shredder (James Saito, voiced by David McCharen) orders O'Neil dispatched.  Coming to her rescue are a quartet of sewer-dwelling, surf-slang speaking Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, who eventually take it upon themselves to defeat the Foot Clan and save the City...The film's story undoubtedly has potential and there are some very interesting parallels between the heroes and the villains.  The Turtles, as guided by their rat-mentor Splinter (Kevin Clash), are fun-loving but essentially principled individuals who try to make the best of themselves and the world around them.  This is in stark contrast to the Foot Clan, made up of disillusioned teenagers who have taken the easy way out, to end up being exploited for the Shredder's selfish ends.The main problem with the story is the characters, especially the human characters, are not developed sufficiently to make this come alive.  April O'Neil, her boss and his delinquent son along with sports-nut vigilante Casey Jones (Elias Koteas) all have situations and dilemmas that are never fully explored. It isn't helped that these parts are half-heartedly acted. With the exception of Koteas, who adds a wry flippancy to his role, the actors are only too happy to play second-fiddle to the Turtles.It is left to the Turtles themselves to amuse, and for the most part they do, delivering their now-dated slang with relish and abandon.  The only one with any distinctive personality, though, is Raphael (Josh Pais, voiced by Ken Troum) whose hot-headed impetuousness nearly costs him his life. Kevin Clash makes for an appealingly gentle Splinter who genuinely cares about his sons.  The best dramatic moments in the film are when Splinter is delivering monologues, which add significant depth and background to both himself and his charges.  The Shredder and his brutal lieutenant Tatsu (Toshishiro Obata) make for sinister, if one-dimensional, villains.Technically, the film could have been more inventively shot and set.  Too much of the cinematography is bland and uninspiring.  Nevertheless, the soundtrack is good and through it the moods of various scenes are vividly depicted and livened up.  The fight scenes are well choreographed, and provide great opportunities for comedy amid the chop-socky derring-do.Not as lively as the cartoon, and with significantly underdeveloped characters, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a brave, watchable but mildly disappointing effort.

The artwork had a grittiness to it that helped define the twisted nature of the stories. Nothing was too weird for the stories. And the Turtles dished out superb butt kickings at every turn. The stories were always a bit more adult oriented than some might come to expect from a title best known for giving kids outrageous ideas for pizza toppings.The film, at least I found, was a pretty good blend of the different formats the Turtles had been subjected to. Enough of the cartoon premise was left in to appease the kids,(the Turtles being more fun loving adolescents than the brooding juveniles of the original books, April being a reporter and so forth) while tapping into some of the darkness that the original books had to keep the comic geeks happy. And also followed more of the continuity that the original comics followed (albeit rather abridged - specifically the confrontation at April's and the hiding out in the country) Plus - this film being the last film Jim Henson oversaw before his death places it in a special spot in my heart. The puppetry is top notch (puppetry is an artform, darn it!) and the fight scenes are more than impressive (considering those turtle costumes weighed about 60 lbs. a piece)Judith Hoag and Elias Koteas have great chemistry together and the voices for the Turtles are spot on how I always envisioned them.I'm a fan of the 'old school' Turtles - but I have to say the film did them justice. Forget the cartoons - read the original title from Mirage Comics and you'll understand my love of the film. Now if only they had NOT made the rest of the films. but what are you going to do?

I was right smack in the middle of the marketing demographic for the Turtles phenomenon. When they hit it big in 89-92, I was just starting my teenage years. They appealed to me, and even reminded me of frog characters I drew as a kid (which preceeded TMNT and didn't win me a dime. Oh well).   Anyway, if you don't like the Ninja Turtles, this movie won't help. It's well made, but more of the same so if you don't like the idea then you still won't after watching this. But darn it, when I was a kid, and the lines stretched for a block to see this movie, I was right there excitedly waiting, wanting to see the coolest characters the late 80s had to offer. And darn it, Being a fan of the characters at the time, I was impressed with what I saw.    Surprisingly, though the characters are goofy and always were, this movie is pretty serious. Yeah, there's lots of buddiness to the turtle brothers, and they have their own little innocent worldview, but at the same time, there are some serious situations that are addressed complete with deliberate pacing and lighting. Some scenes are just plain stark, like the one in which the antagonist, Shredder, violently backhands the defenseless rat creature (Splinter) that he has in custody. And I was surprised to see the characters given actual emotions, like Raphael who cries, yells an obscenity or two, and even furiously lashes out at others in sheer frustration. It isn't profound stuff worth note in a psychology book, but definitely a more serious, mature handling of the subject that this reviewer was expecting in his youth.    The story is essentially one of rescue and revenge, but given the subject matter it's based on (a cartoon and comic book about ninja turtles, of course), this is probably the best treatment it could have gotten. I endorse it as being one of the best actual films based on a comic (alongside the first couple Batman films), and although I don't find too much in it nowadays, I can still appreciate the effort and, again, somewhat moody and mature handling of the subject material. And you know, to this day, I still think that the film version of Shredder is one wicked character, and his entrance is great.

It wasn't until the cartoon that they dumbed down his origin so that no one died in it, and made him a person that turned into a rat, which the way the cartoon sets it up is completely illogical, he's just around the ooze and rats so much that he turns into a rat person.In the end, this is a really good movie, that even for a kids movie still finds a way to stay true to some of the dark under-tones of the original comic.

And Thank God They Did it Before the CGI Craze.","Date":"9 January 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":"  ((Possible Spoilers))I love this movie to bits. Conversions of films from something else (eg TV Series, Cartoon, Novel Video Game etc) are always tough things. For about every one person satisfied about 20 hate it for their own reasons. They are either too unfaithful to the source material (virtually everything) or too close to the source material (a good example I've heard is the live action Scooby Doo). Just WHERE do you strike a balance? But with a bit of luck on the timing front and commited people who must've worked on this, the Turtles converted brilliantly from cartoon to live action.The balance was struck for me. What they kept were the turtles, Splinter and Shredder, what the got rid of was Krang and Dimension X. This was trully commited to being a live action attempt and not a pointless live action cartoon. It tries to be as realistic as possible. It also contains emotional scenes and must talked about darker tone. This my friends, is the perfect conversion.First off Raphael was my favourite in the cartoon, because of his sarcasm. They changed him totally, am I mad NO! He's the best here too. Surely many can relate to him, being lonely, isolated and angry with the world. Any small misfortune pushes him over the edge. The first of many positive changes for the move to live action. The rest of the turtles remain the same, new vioces, but the same. What's noticable is that Shredder and Splinter are much more 'Japanese'.This brings me onto Splinter, PURE BRILLIANCE. Perfectly voiced, prefect speeches, perfect music during his speeches, his speeches are my favourite parts of the film; especially the one with Raphael.I also can't stress the importance of how this film doesn't involve digitally created turtles. The turtles look realistic and are properly bought to life by the fact that they properly exist in the world around them. Acting will also always be better with their physical presence, and their relationship with the live action humans is all important. Crucially, it trully allows the turtles to become more 'ninja' than before. It means alot that they went to the trouble of producing decent fight scenes that would have no effect if animated. I'm definitely no fan of CGI use (take Jurrassic Park - I only like the robotic dinosaurs). Another crucial element is that the suits were brilliantly constructed and that the turtles don't look like clones of each other, they're all unique - which may not have happened with CGI.I also love the music in this film. I know that many find the elements such as the music and drama as too much to swallow for a film like this and insist that the film tries to be good however, I find that the value does come from replay, this film can grow on you.I'm not suggesting in any way that this is the perfect film. It does have many drawbacks. Yes, it's practically exclusive to turtles fans. There are many basic gripes here, there, everywhere; no point going into them.I don't think Judith Hoag was made for the part but she does a great job of April. Elias Koteas is also great for the live action itteration of Casey Jones.Usually with these kind of films I love them while young but can't stand them later. This is an exception. With a help from nostalgia I still thought this was great when I saw it again!!! This is great fun. Relive your childhood with this film. Relive those warmer, fuzzier memories. It really is great.This film needed a bit of luck to be so good, being made at a time good enough for the turtle suits but before CGI. Enjoy!

For starters, while still managing to keep this a children's movie, they really managed to mature the story and make it more of something that adults could also enjoy.

Also deserving of mention is the fact that this movie is something almost anyone, any age can enjoy.  It doesn't hurt that this movie actually has heart, either.  And yes, the original may have cashed in on the Turtles craze, but at least people got their money's worth.  Believe it or not, there's some genuine emotional interaction between characters.  My two favorite examples being when the turtles channel Splinter's spirit through meditation (yeah, go ahead, say I'm crazy!  I don't care!), and also when Ralph awakens to find Leonardo waiting vigil.  The costumes are excellent, as well as the acting (for the most part). The only actor that I had a problem with was the guy who played Charles. The guy kept flubbing his lines!  Don't believe me?  Well, in the scene where he's at April's apartment the morning after her mugging, watch when he starts to say the wrong thing and then catches himself (I think Judith Hoag realized his little mistake too; watch her subtle reaction).  Anyway, Charles says  I...I've...YOU'VE been working really hard lately. Plus, his acting was wooden and unnatural, unlike like Judith Hoag and Elias Koteas'.  Hoag made a spunky yet realistic April, and Koteas made an AWESOME Casey Jones.  April and Casey had excellent chemistry even though they had to pretend they hated eachother during most of the movie (too bad Hoag was replaced later in the series).   Last thing Why are people complaining about this movie's gloominess and grittiness?  If you're a TMNT fan, how could you NOT want it to be like that?  That's what makes it so atmospheric!  Griff, who reviewed TMNT II says the first film's quality is so poor and grainy that it looks like it was filmed in someone's basement with a camcorder, but I beg to differ; save those types of comments for the workprint.  You will never know what 'atrocious video quality' is until you've seen the workprint for this baby.  I admit, the quality in the final print's a little underlet and slightly grainy, but the rough cut's quality is absolutely horrendous.  Half the time, in everything excluding the sewer scenes, it's so dark and blurry it's hard to tell who's who but at least you see the characters and hear the low, muffled audio.  In the sewer scenes, you can't even tell what's going on (if you know the final cut to an extent, you can kind of sense where they are though)!

This picture is one of the series of children's character movie tie-ins, and by all rights it should be unbearably awful, just like the rest. Luckily for us, the filmmakers seemed to realize that the turtles had a large adult audience from the comic books out there, so they managed to sneak in a little real drama and some actual character development into this so-called children's movie. Unfortunately, as the cartoon show came to dominate and the turtles were seen as only a kid's phenomenon, this element was sadly taken out of later entries in the series.Many things were thankfully gotten right. The turtles were done very well here. Unlike watching, say, `Howard The Duck', I found it rather easy here to suspend my disbelief and forget that I'm watching four guys in rubber suits. The comedic aspects of their personalities were hit bang on as well, the banter flowing smoothly and true to form. The fight scenes, while not very memorable, were done with some talent behind them and turn out rather well. The character of Casey Jones is surprisingly believable and likeable.Now, I'm not nominating this film for any awards, not by a long shot. It's a quickie tie-in, so there is the expected large list of flaws. April O'Neil, as in all the other entries in the series, is acted horrendously badly. The filmmakers go through the background story so quickly that it would easy to miss something. The final fight with Shredder is woefully disappointing, with this supposedly unbeatable ninja being taken in by a childishly simple trick.But, overall, I'd say this is a good family picture, better than most of junk that's put out in the genre.

I was expecting very little, mostly just watching it for nostalgia.Well, I got a lot more than nostalgia.This was still a really fun movie to watch, almost as fun as it was ten years ago.  The production and martial arts work is done by Golden Harvest, the same company that made a lot of Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, and other Hong Kong action films; so the action in this flick is well done and really fun to watch.  The costumes are done by Jim Henson's company, and look very, very nice--in my opinion, even better than the aliens in The Phantom Menace, which look a bit too clean and polished to be very realistic in my opinion... Splinter and the turtles actually look gritty here, like they really live in a sewer.Sure, the movie's campy at points, what do you expect from a film that's made for kids?  The thing is that a lot of the lines that are supposed to be funny actually *are* funny, although part of this might be due to nostalgia.  Surprisingly, though, this movie has a lot of drama in it, and some serious themes are addressed; friendship and teamwork, of course, but also the problem of troubled youth in modern America.  The enemies the Turtles face aren't just evil bad-guys, but misguided children and teenagers who have been estranged from their families because their parents are so busy working all the time that they don't spend any time with them, so these youngsters have gone elsewhere to find a sense of belonging.  This makes the conflict in the TMNT movie much more two-sided and interesting than Batman versus the Joker, as violence isn't the only solution that the Turtles resort to when facing their enemy.  Of course, The Shredder is still the Embodiment of Pure Evil and it's fun to watch the interplay between the good guys and bad guys on that level...  But the other great part of this movie is the redemption of the youngsters.  Sure, it's melodramatic and campy, but it's well-executed in my opinion.  The development of the unstable friendship of the four turtles is also carried out really well, and Splinter ain't no Yoda, but he's still an awesome (and very funny) father figure.The plot is excellent, involving some nice tie-ins to feudal Japan, and the characters are very well-developed, unlike the cardboard characters featured in most other comic book movies.  Overall, I know a lot of my enjoyment for this movie comes from nostalgia for the Turtles, this movie definitely isn't Oscar material or anything, but I would have to say that it's still probably one of my favorite comic book movies of all time, ranking (in my opinion) just behind the masterpieces like the first Batman movie, X-Men, the Crow, and some others.

Like Batman did and X-Men probably will, TMNT turned a rather cheesy show/cartoon and turned into a darker, more serious film, more like the graphic novels (comics) they either originated from or inspired. The second one was a lot more popular among the younger fans, and me, probably because it was a little more like the cartoon, which is what a lot of parents and little, little kids wanted. The Batman series made that mistake with the last two installments by making them more like the old TV show.

One of the best action/comedy/fantasy films in Hollywood history. It tells the tale of four pubescent, anomalous, kung fu tortoises (if you don't know what that means, consult a thesaurus) who live in the sewers of New York City, learn martial arts from an overgrown Japanese rat named Splinter, and love to eat pizza (without anchovies). The comic book craze of the 1980s explodes onto the big screen with a vengeance. The movie is pretty faithful to the comic book origin (possible spoilers ahead). After being covered in a bath of green slime, four baby turtles grow to hominid proportions and gain human intelligence. They are befriended by Splinter, who teaches them ninjitsu and names them after four Italian artists Michelangelo, Leonardo, Donatello, and Raphael. Each turtle has his own weapoon nunchuku (sticks and chain), katanas (swords), bo (staff) and sais (three-pronged daggers), respectively. The turtles go up against an evil ninja named The Shredder, who, thanks to his outfit, never needs a can opener. The movie is packed with plenty of adventure, witty humor, and intrigue. And anybody from 9 to 99 can enjoy it. It boasts a distinctive film noir/gothic set design similar to that of the BATMAN films, yet never betrays its cheesy comic book origins. I also liked how the movie played up the urban legend element of the turtles; they come out only at night and must never be seen by either their enemies or the people they rescue. There is even a funny scene where one of the turtles goes out to see a movie, but has to disguise himself in a 1940s-style detective outfit so no one will know he's a turtle. And then there are the characters. The turtles are all delightfully rambunctious, and Splinter delivers a great performance similar to that of Yoda in the STAR WARS movies. The Shredder is as scary as hell, and his minions dress in black from head to foot. Other characters include April O'Neil, a news reporter who discovers the turtles' lair; and Casey Jones, a Central Park vigilante who uses sports equipment (golf clubs, hockey sticks, etc.) to fight crime. As the turtles put it, he's Wayne Gretzky on steroids. Two sequels (one in 1991 and the other in '92 or so) followed this movie, but neither matched the excellence of the original. If you want to see a classic Hollywood movie that's perfect for both family and friends, see this. You'll have a blast!

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles had the luxury of seeing both worlds.  Brought to media through a Saturday morning cartoon, this show was geared toward little kids with the philosophy nobody dies or gets hurt but everyone's fighting.  Once set for the big screen, a seasoned filmmaker and a realist could truly capture and express the potential of such a creative idea.  However, if the movie fell into the hands off all those greedy money hungry business men who utterly destroy all creativity for the sake of more dollar bills this movie could have been just as unemotional as the cartoon. Luckily for the entire world a wonderful adaptation was accepted.  First, the set in New York City was an entire different atmosphere than the cartoon, which complimented the realistic approach to the whole unrealistic plot.  Second, they jumped to live action and pulled it off flawlessly. Third, dialogue was tremendous and attempted to stay away from anything TOO corny without losing the corny jokes.  And lastly, the emotional level the movie came with was so totally unexpected and brilliant that it completely crossed the thick line between senseless cartoons and a compelling movie. I thought this movie was a landmark for capturing the true potential from a creative children's cartoon.  Another example of this kind of accomplishment is the movie Batman.  To finish I conclude than anyone who knows about theNinja Turtles should not be shy of seeing the movie thinking that it is the same as the cartoon.  That kind of thinking will leave you without the presence of a great movie.Adam "},{"Title":"Hey!

For one thing, it was darker, that didn't bother me.  The turtles didn't want to fight the bad guys really, that didn't bother me.  One thing that did bother me was that Splinter was actually just a rat before he became Splinter, in the cartoon he was the guy that Shredder killed in the movie that owned Splinter.  No big deal I guess.  The things that I really missed were Krang, the little brain guy from the cartoon, and Bebop and Rocksteady, the warthog and rhino, also from the cartoon.  I've read that this movie was more like the comics were, (I never got to read them) so I guess that's where the differences were spawned from, but I think they could have added Krang, Bebop and Rocksteady so that it would be a nice blend between cartoon and comics, for people that missed out on one of the two.

I was expecting the movie to be a rehash of the animated series I so enjoyed, only with live-action folks in the roles. As it turned out, the movie more closely followed the early 80's comic series that the characters first appeared in, which I was only vaguely aware of. I saw a different approach to the TMNT than I'd ever imagined four somewhat-angry teens, who weren't interested in the superhero adventuring they performed in the cartoon, and instead concentrated on just surviving a world they long to be a part of, but can never have. Seeing Raphael as a rage-driven loner was a far cry from the sarcastic TV version, but what really set the movie apart were the fight scenes.  When the Foot Clan ambushed Raph, and invade April's apartment, I was sure the TMNT would whale on 'em!  Instead they were quite logically outnumbered and fought a losing battle with serious consequences.  Helping them out was Casey Jones, a vigilante who was definitely not the one-dimensional Dirty Harry rip-off as seen on TV. Even in the face of all the violence was the story of the Turtles pulling together as brothers, as a family, in times of crisis.

I must have seen each episode at least 10 times each, but I never became bored of watching it along with my friends.  During the years it would also air during the mornings, during the afternoons, and on channel 4 with the Saturday Morning Cartoons (airing on 4 different channels).  While watching the cartoon, reading the comics, playing TMNT role playing games, TMNT video games, and adding to my TMNT action figure collection I always wanted to know what they would look like if they were made into a live movie.  One evening I then was flipping through the channels, and I saw a trailer for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles The Movie!!!  I was so excited and ran around the house to tell my sister and parents about it.  The rest of the night I was searching for the trailer again, and my sister's friends were wondering what I was doing. When I finally saw the trailer again the next day I had the same delightful feeling.  I remember my friends telling me that they did the same thing when the first saw the trailer too.  The first day the movie was released my friend and I went to get tickets for the movie, but the shows were sold out for two showing times so we had to return at 4 PM to see the movie with his mother (I was 10 years old).  When we actually saw the movie we had to be separated from each other, and we arrived 45 minutes early.  However, my attention was completely dedicated to the movie which put me in awe.  I was quite shocked when I first heard Raphael say D*** when he lost his sai in the beginning since in the cartoon there were no cuss words at all.  The movie was quite violent too, but there was no gore.  D*** was said a few times, but that is the worst word in the movie.  In a matter of fact I remember that TMNT was originally going to get a PG-13 rating, but they had to fight for a PG rating (I am not sure if any footage was cut though). However, compared to what you see on television today this movie is what children should be watching.  There are good morals involved such as steeling is wrong, and you should not fight unless you use if for self-defense at you are unable to run away.  However, this is not why I wanted to see the movie...  I wanted to see the ninja turtles beat up Shredder in a live movie.  Also I hoped that the movie would follow the comics, and it did.  The comics were mature (explains Raphael's character) and the characters developed the same way unlike the cartoon.  However, the ninja turtles do not all have red bands and April O'Neil is not black. Well, I just feel that this is the best movie that is for kids mainly (adults will probably prefer to watch this with their kids over Barnie and Power Rangers; I would any day) that is based on a comic book or cartoon and turned into a live movie.

There's a lot of cool-looking action and martial arts for kids to mimic at home; even a minute of the film doesn't go by without one of the characters cracking a joke; a synth-soundtrack creates an easy-going atmosphere even to the most menacing and darkest scenes and there's even some Ninja life wisdoms and guide lines to spare for the young audience to follow and live by. Great.Maybe the film's greatest achievement is the way it manages to bring the animated characters into the real wold; the costumes are great and really do their part to make the scenes somewhat believable. The mouth and eye movements of the turtles are a bit jerky and twitchy at times and it seems that their hands aren't that good at picking up objects but other than that, it's all good. The rat is a puppet and that way so much easier to do than the a man inside the costume -turtles; it all looks good enough to make the film work.The cast is a mixed one; Elias Koteas (Casey Jones) and Judith Hoag (April O'Neil) are great, Toshiro Obata (Tatsu) and James Saito (The Shredder) not so much, but they still get the job done. The bad guys just are too campy and over-the-top to be menacing or taken seriously at all &#x96; which surely hasn't been the choice of the actors so I can give them a break about it; The Shredder's purple & sparkly wardrobe doesn't really help his case either.The action is nicely choreographed and there's some real ninja -feel in the action sequences.

Their relationship has been changed a bit from the plot in the original comic books.I really love the ambiance!

After painfully watching the new Ninja Turtles reboot or remake or whatever Hollywood is calling it, I felt compelled to rewatch the first Turtle movie from 1990. What makes this movie so special and great is how the film makers were able to blend the original Eastman comic and the very popular cartoon of the 80's into a coherent, dark, action packed, and humorous movie without making it feel to far fetched. I have always been a fan of practical effects. In a time before CGI, the film makers were able to use makeup, costumes, and puppetry to bring the Turtles to life. The Ninja Turtles in this movie look a thousand times better than the awfully designed CG Turtles in the new movie. This movie also captures the dark and gritty side of New Yorks underbelly while still being able to lighten the mood using the Turtles offbeat humor. The other aspect of the film that works well is how they tackle the Foot Clan. By using kids who come from broken homes and giving them everything that a young boy would want, gives the Foot Clan a perfect opportunity to brainwash these kids into being indoctrinated into their crime syndicate. As far as villains go, I found the Shredder to be very Opposing who commands the screen with his pure evil presence. This movie is just a ton of fun and it is cool all the way around. I will admit that I do have nostalgic values when the t comes to this movie. I just hope a new generation of kids will be able to appreciate the original. Overall forget the New Turtles movie.

It's farcical. It's downright silly. And yet I found myself enjoying this senseless Kung-Fu fest. The plot? The leader of an evil ninja gang, The Foot Clan, starts recruiting the aimless adolescents of New York City to do his bidding for him. This leader dresses in steel plated body armor and calls himself&#x97;rather comically, I thought&#x97;Shredder. As the police of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are&#x97;like those of most vigilante films&#x97;characteristically inept, only 4 anthropomorphic turtles and their mysterious rat sensei, Splinter, have any chance at all of defeating Shredder and his army of 12 year olds. Thankfully, Splinter has trained the turtles from birth in Ninjutsu, the ancient Japanese art of er..something or other. A good bit of punching and kicking is involved, and that is all that really matters for the intents and purposes of this film. If you can get past the contrivance of 4 extremely short physical actors in rubber turtle suits sparring with a walking can opener, you might just enjoy this film. For my part, I didn't much care for the endless fight scenes, the lame dialogue, or the dated special effects. Much more interesting was the performance by the unsung Elias Koteas as the boorish vigilante Casey Jones.Casey, despite being human, is no less ridiculous a character than the turtles. He wears a hockey mask and carries a cache of sporting equipment he uses as weapons in a golf bag. He patrols the city alone at night, beating up muggers and purse snatchers with cricket paddles. In real life, Casey would last a full 5 minutes on the streets of New York before having his skull perforated a half dozen times by the magnum slugs of the first mugger he accosted. That I was able to take at least one character in this film seriously is a testament to the performance of Koteas. Here is an actor with brutish charm, good looks, and good if not excellent comedic timing. A quick look at his IMDb resume reveals he is still a working actor a full 20 years after the release of this film. It saddens me that this man never really made it big. I suspect it has something to do with the fact that he started losing his hair in his late 20s and was no longer beautiful enough to audition for George Clooney's roles.What else is there to be said for this film? The choreography is adequate; not stunning, but not too far below par. The story is somehow less silly than the black and white comic book it was based on; the smallest of triumphs. The turtles are named after renaissance artists; a nice touch, I thought. All in all I can't by any stretch of the imagination recommend this film to others, but there were things about it I found charming.

If more were made of the Jim Henson animatronics and if it had stuck closer to the comic-book source instead of giving us a live action version of the awful (let's be honest) 80's animated show then it could have been a classic. Not what we get.The original black and white comics of TMNT were a-maz-ing! The depth, the mythology, the subtext, the endless Lovecraftian allusions and the overall coolness of it is something so great I am sure it can never be done again. The 80's animated show was a travesty. We got robots instead of humans in the Foot Clan, the friendly Utrom aliens were made into a bad guy (Krang), Rocksteady and Beebop!, the Technodrome!, underground drilling machine-thingies and those awful, awful surfer dialect words. Who can honestly NOT cringe when they hear 'Cowabunga', 'bodacious' or 'excellent' in this day and age?The plot loosely matches that of the first issue of the comic-book. Only it's toned down and it's too heavily influenced by the TV show. The Shredder has a tamer 'death' compared to the comic book (he was thrown off a roof while holding a live hand grenade-BOOM!). Though I am glad the Turtles' origin is told in flashback instead of starting right at the beginning like so many other comic-book movies. Steve Barron's direction (Merlin and erm...Coneheads) brings some integrity to the film. I like the grainy and gritty look to some scenes and he seems to take the animatronics more seriously than the directors for the later sequels.Speaking of which, the animatronics are actually still quite good and if made today I'd still be impressed. The real human cast is a bit of a letdown. Judith Hoag is awful as April O'Neil, in the comics she was a lab assistant to the evil Baxter Stockman but the TV show inexplicably changed her to a News Reporter. That's what she is here. And the ginger kid who plays Danny is pretty bad also. However, Elias Koteas is totally brilliant as Casey Jones. I can't imagine anyone being more perfect in this role.The humor, minus the surfer drawl, is still funny. I especially like Raphael (my fave-he has a BAD attitude) coming out of a cinema showing 'Critters' and saying 'Where the hell do they come up with this stuff?'And John Du Prez's(who???) score may sound heavily dated in parts but it keeps the action scenes moving along nicely. The fights may look incredibly staged and false but at least they have a nice beat.It's still superior to the sequels and plenty fun. Just don't grit your teeth so hard at the silly, completely out-of-place and out-of-time surfer words and appreciate the darker tone the sequels ditched in favor of kiddie-friendly rubbish. The DVD gives a 1.851 anamorphic transfer of the movie and it's very grainy and dirty (as the film was shot) but the Dolby 5.1 soundtrack packs a loud punch with plenty of bass. Extras are minimal. New Line should re-release this as a Platinum/Infinifilm Special Edition.And just for the record, there will be NO 4th turtles movie. There was talk of it years ago but the guys who were interested in making it ended up choosing to produce the Bulletproof Monk movie instead.

I watched it at the time and enjoyed it and watched it recently and enjoyed it again. Of course one should not take this as a suggestion that this is a very good film, because of course it isn't. It is all rather silly and is clearly designed to appeal to teenagers with its mix of surfer language, goofing around and bloodless martial arts action. It all actually works better now because it is helped by providing reminiscence value for those of us who were young at the time of the original series. The plot is basic but works although I didn't get into the humour at all. The action is fun and well choreographed despite not being impressive enough for actual martial arts fans, but it is better than I had expected.The cast are mixed. Forman, Sisti, Tilden and Pais are all reasonable enough and do quite well considering how buried in prosthetics they were; it was only Pais that I felt overdid the Noo Yark accent to his detriment. Hoag is OK but I never thought she was hot enough for the dialogue other characters said about her. Koteas is a strange find but he at least brings an element of roguish fun to the film and I enjoyed his performance even if it isn't the type of film I like him for. Saito is suitably menacing and the support cast is so-so with the odd good turn from people like Obata and a few surprises such as a young Sam Rockwell!

There's a lot of humor that kids certainly wouldn't understand (James Cagney, The Grapes of Wrath) and there's a lot of darker moments including scenes of kids committing crimes, smoking and doing various other things. I thought the screenplay was pretty good because it gives you plenty of characters to care for and it also delivers a good villain that you want to see destroyed. Throughout all the martial art scenes we get a rather good sense of humor (you have to with talking turtles) and especially the stuff dealing with all the pizza that these teenage turtles want. The vocal work by all is very impressive and we get nice performances from Judith Hoag as a female reporter.

When I was about eight or nine years old, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles started to die out as fast as they had come. By the time I was twelve, they were gone. The companies stopped marketing the action figures in huge quantities, the television show started to lose everyone's interest. The toys stayed with the kids for a while, until they broke, and then the kids couldn't get any more. Looking back, I realize that we were all duped. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are, in a way, the most lousy heroes of all time. They're giant turtles who live in sewers and eat frozen pizza. But hey, during the eighties, what more could you ask for?I remember them in their little plastic cases from the toy store, and oh how I wanted to buy them. Donatello, Leonardo, Michaelangelo, and Raphael - big, green reptiles who got in some toxic waste and mutated into - here it comes - TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES. Actually, maybe it should be Teenaged Mutant Ninja Turtles. If I recall correctly, the name switched around a few times. But anywho, they started off on the Nintendo game console as one-dimensional little figures that could jump, attack, and eat pizza for health. What a game. Suddenly they became hugely popular . They got their own arcade booths in 7-11 stores, their own marketing products, their own TV show, their own action figures modeled after each other, and even three movies. And the saddest part of it is that the turtles never got paid a dime. If only Superman and Batman were real and could come down from the heavens some day to claim their percentage of mass profit. The world would be a stranger place, that's for sure.Soon every kid who was a kid owned at least one merchandising item from the TMNT franchise, whether it be comics, shirts, toys, games, etc. They were wildly successful, and every kid knew their names and every parent was sick of hearing their names. Eventually the four turtles became so famous that parenting groups jumped on an anti-TMNT bandwagon and rallied to get rid of the turtles, calling them violent and ugly (of course, this was just because the parents were tired of hearing about the fictional characters from their children). They said that unlike Superman and Batman and Spider-Man, these heroes had martial arts weapons and injured people. Tell me, what is the difference between Batman punching and kicking villains, leaving POW! marks on the television screen, as compared to turtles kicking butt? Parents have never understood the times. Just think back to when Jazz was a sin and Rock 'n' Roll was evil.But those big green turtles were a staple of the eighties and early nineties. I remember everything about that era, and now I may realize what it must have been like when Superman was first released to the general public. You think sixties, you think Batman. You think seventies...I don't know, you think of something else. And when you think eighties, you think turtles. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.It is now I realize for the first time I haven't even begun to critique the film itself here. Bear with me, people. As a mutant fan-boy of the franchise, I couldn't wait to see the feature film version of my favorite superheroes. The only problem was that I was one of the many children banned by parents from seeing it. So, of course, I stuck to my action heroes (which were now branching off into Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Action Dolls and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles MOVIE Action Dolls with Clothing and Items from the Movie) until I schemed a way to see the film. (I can't really remember how I eventually saw it in the first place.)It was a major disappointment. Corny, stupid, fast-paced but yet watchable. I thought that the turtles looked good in their green rubber Jim Henson suits, and April looked just like the cartoon character, but the master of the turtles, a giant rat, didn't look so hot. Either did the film. It was as corny as unpopped popcorn and a dull entry in the comic book adaptations area. (For good adaptations see Batman 1989, X-Men 2000, Spider-Man 2001...)As a fan of the series I was disappointed in the film. As a child I watched it simply because I thought I would like it better each time, and I still watch it to this day - why, I do not really know. It has a strange watchable force surrounding it that sucks you in and doesn't let go.This isn't a very good movie, but in a few senses, the entire franchise wasn't exactly cleverly built, so I guess it got what was coming. Something like Batman or Superman seems to have at least a decent premise, specifically Batman, and perhaps that is why it has stood the test of time so greatly. Looking back, the whole TMNT franchise exists primarily as a cash-in on a well-known videogame. The greedy corporate executives milked the franchise and children for all they were worth. Older now, I realize this isn't so great. But as a child, it is evident that I loved this series, and isn't that the point?As a kid I loved everything about the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Now, I'm not so sure. I still love those green jerks, and everything about them. But at the same time I realize that it's a bittersweet love nonexistent when I was more naive. Sure, I still watch them and smile thinking back, but maybe I'm beginning to understand why they didn't make it past the nineties.Cowabunga, dudes.

A couple of years later I watched it and I am glad I didn't go to the theater to see this.  The thing that gets me is they had such a cool villian and there was most definately not a cool fight between him and our heros.  In fact how the villian was defeated was a big disappointment.  Aside from Shredder none of the characters are worth mentioning.  A bunch of stupid plot points and other things.  Another dumb point is the rat in the cage mimiking karate...the cartoon did it better with the man becoming a rat, the rat becoming more human is just a bit to stupid.  This movie will probably entertain kids, but not to many adults. "},{"Title":"Lambbasted by theater-wide movie critics, beloved by fans. I agree with the critics.","Date":"1 June 2012","Score":"1 out of 11 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":" TMNT (1990) is hardly a remake at all, it's connected to the cartoon and comics 99% like a printed copy of a scanned paper. I was never really a fan of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles because of its' flat reasons for trying to make people eager to like turtles just for their personalities and being cool superheroes just because they can take down weak ninjas called the Foot Clan which (even though ninjas are known for being disciplined since ancient times to be experts in military skills). The very few heroes of good quality defeating very common villains of pathetic quality is overused in so many cartoons/movies, not only the superhero genre.TMNT's protagonist heroes do little to (and obviously don't have to) explain their origins, yes I get it already I just read the title of the movie so I already know that Splinter & the Turtles were mutated into humanoids. The movie's plot is extremely narrow with criminals stealing precious items combating super strong heroes who are supposed to be loved by their sense of humor which is targeted at very young kids. This film is overrated, it should have been rated G not PG.Overall, this was one of the most boring films I have ever watched. If you already loved the Turtles starting from the first comics or the 1980s cartoon or the future installments in the franchise, then you'll obviously dig this film. I really can't understand how TMNT got popular in the first place, as I never really liked the series. "}]
