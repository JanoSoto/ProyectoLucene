It is about a woman up against death row. An attorney steps in and tries to save her life by proving her innocence in a murder trial. I have always been intrigued with prison movies for their grittiness, and drama, and Last Dance has some real moments of tension. However the grittiness is somewhat lacking, until the end (and even there its not as strong). What saves the movie is strong acting, specifically from Stone (who is somewhat Hollywood's female version of Sean Penn in that they exceed in the lowlife bad guy roles like no other). 7/10.

It's really sad because back then, even she was a victim herself, of abuse by her boyfriend as well as people in her immediate family background. But two wrongs don't make a right. Her drunken and drug high resulted in the death of innocent people for which she has gotten stuck serving time while her crazy boyfriend at the time goes score free. The majority of the film is in her lawyer's point of view as he tries desperately to save her from death by lethal injection and in the process falls in love with her. It is stunningly shot though slow paced (and as well it should be, it's a film about the supposed last days of somebody's life Hello!) and brilliantly acted.

I've seen this movie a dozen of times and as a law student I must say that it is better than your average John Grisham legal drama maybe except for The Rainmaker. This film takes on the professional and ethical dilemma of a young clemency attorney Rick Hayes played by Rob Morrow who befriends a death row inmate convicted of double murder Cindy Liggett played by Sharon Stone. She is about to be executed. He moves heaven and earth to save her from death by lethal injection. The rest of the cast are excellent from Peter Gallagher and Jack Thompson.

Karla committed a double murder much like that portrayed in the film, and, like the film's Cindy Liggett, reformed her life in prison. Also like Liggett, she was a fairly attractive, articulate woman who argued eloquently, though futilely, for clemency. Unlike Liggett, however, Karla became a born-again Christian, and her clemency plea was supported by several prominent pastors including Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson. It is thus notable that the governor who signed her death warrant was none other than our current, allegedly born-again President, George W. Bush. It is possible that nothing in Bush's checkered career reveals his true character more clearly than his callous, smirking mockery of Karla's dignified plea for her life during an interview with Talk Magazine the year after her execution.Incidentally, Karla Faye Tucker Brown was killed by the state of Texas in 1998, two years after this film came out. That suggests that the filmmakers might have been trying to to make an argument for clemency, as Errol Morris did for Randall Adams with his documentary The Thin Blue Line. If so, it failed miserably.

But what makes it interesting is how it does not dwell on the morality of whether it's right or wrong to execute convicted criminals, but rather it focuses on the corruption of human government which uses lives for political manipulation. Whether you're in favor of capital punishment or not, we can all agree that we shouldn't send people to their deaths just so someone can win an election, right? That's the core theme of this film. One prisoner may be pardoned--why?--not because he's worthy but simply because the public likes him and will vote for any politician who will pardon him. Another prisoner may not be so politically valuable, so he ends up behind the 8 ball.With this approach in mind, Last Dance leads us through a nightmarish labyrinth of human justice where innocence and guilt have nothing to do with punishment. Sharon Stone plays Cindy a condemned killer who brutally murdered two people 12 years prior. What follows is not an issue of whether she deserves to live or die, but it's an issue of whether her fate should be determined by a small handful of powerful people with only their own interests in mind.There's a great line from the movie where one character shirks his responsibility with It's just the system and another character responds we ARE the system. Without devolving into a cartoonish conspiracy thriller, this film takes a broad and disturbing look at the ongoing failure of human justice. It's reminiscent of Orson Welles' masterpiece The Trial in the way that it doesn't accuse any individual culprit but rather the entire collective system which seems to perpetuate itself simply by people refusing to take a stand.While there's not a lot of action, it's definitely a roller-coaster as our hero Ricky (Rob Morrow) struggles to set things right. Don't expect a fast paced flick with car chases and evil villains on his tail. No, this is the real world, and the only villains are his bosses, colleagues and politicians who thwart his progress by simply doing what they do every day.Excellent acting by Sharon Stone makes you connect with her even though you remain fully aware that she is a killer. There's one fantastic scene in particular where you feel her exasperation come to a boil. It expresses the exasperation of American citizens who are so sick of corruption that they're ready to give up. Meanwhile Ricky symbolizes the spirit of the individual who is ready to fight it to the end.Directed by Bruce Beresford, known for the sentimental Driving Miss Daisy, this film definitely knows how to tug at your emotions. But at the same time it doesn't lose itself in sappy melodrama.If movies like this interest you, I highly recommend Monster and the accompanying documentary Aileen Wurnos Life and Death of a Serial Killer. If you like films that explore the failure of the court system and why it fails, definitely check out the grandfather of such films 12 Angry Men, a slow yet riveting film set entirely within 1 room as jurors expose their own prejudices & selfish interests while deciding the fate of a young boy on trial. Films like these are practically historical documents as well as highly powerful cinema.

Cindy, it appears, is resigned to die. She doesn't want the idea of getting false hopes, which is what happens when a young idealistic lawyer tries to have her execution stopped because he finds flaws in her case. Unfortunately, his pleas in favor of his client go into deaf ears.Rich Hayes, a young lawyer, returns home to a job his brother John, a lawyer working in the legal system, has been able to get for him. He is assigned to the clemency department, reviewing old cases that have been tried already. The Cindy Liggett murder conviction gets his attention. It's clear, from the start, her reaction is negative. She feels she is better off dead, rather than serve life in jail. At first, Cindy clashes with Rich, but his earnestness win her over, as she begins to see some hope.Rich, for his part, steps into many toes. Worst of all, he makes a blunder by accosting the state Governor at the wrong place, at the wrong time. The Governor believes in the death sentence and is against showing clemency for a murderess like Ms. Liggett, who, as far as he is concerned, has shown no remorse in the horrible way she killed. The last moments of the film involve Cindy's preparation to die by lethal injection for the crimes she committed. It is a tense time as Rich tries to do everything possible to spare the convict of the impending death. There is a tender moment when Cindy discovers a dress Rich has bought for her to wear at her execution.Bruce Heresford has had some successes in his long film career, both in his native Australia and in America. This film will always be compared to Dead Man Walking, a more intense, and better film. The screen play by Ron Koslow doesn't quite make us care too much for a woman who has, apparently, not an ounce of redeeming qualities. We don't believe for one moment that the young lawyer, who also hasn't done anything worth while in his life will take the convict's case to heart like he does in the film.The best thing in Last Dance is Sharon Stone. She obviously wanted to be taken seriously when she agreed to do this movie. Her Cindy Liggett shows a hardened soul who awakens to realize the consequences of her actions and must pay for them. Rob Morrow, who plays Rich Hays throws away the film in the way he plays the character. We don't believe him for a moment he is this man who tries so hard to have Cindy's conviction changed to life. Randy Quaid, Peter Gallagher, Jack Thompson, and Skeet Ulrich are seen in the film. The main reason to watch Last Dance is Sharon Stone who shows she has the potential to do better things in her movie career.

It comes out after a great film like Dead Man Walking and the comparisons that were thrown at it were inevitable. Story starts out with a young lawyer named Rick Hayes (Rob Morrow) who with the help of his successful brother John (Peter Gallagher) gets a state appointed job and is given the case of a female death row inmate who is only days away from her execution after 12 years. Hayes goes to the prison to meet Cindy Liggett (Sharon Stone) and what he finds is a very angry and cold person who would rather be executed than get life in prison. Hayes thinks he can make a case with evidence that was not used in her trial but getting Cindy to cooperate is tough. One of the reasons for Hayes working so hard on this case is to prove to his brother that he's a good lawyer and wants to come out of Johns shadow. The film is directed by the terrific Bruce Beresford and technically its a well made film and their is some good use of lighting in certain shots that remind us that some real talent is involved in the making of this picture. But the story just fails and one of the reasons would be of course that it comes out after Dead Man Walking is still very fresh in everyones mind. Also, I'm not one of those persons that think that Stone is a bad actress. I think she's very good but can she carry a film all by herself? For the most part, no!. Especially when the film is at a disadvantage like this one when it desperately needed a major box office draw to save it. Stone is very effective when she's not the center of the story. More than just a character actress, but not by much. The character that Stone portrays in this film is also one that is hard to feel anything for. You don't hate her and you don't root for her either. So the viewer is left with a very hollow film and when its over you can't think of one memorable scene. In a film about the death penalty you would think that their would be plenty of very emotional scenes. But when its over, its hard to think of one. The makers of this film really needed to think hard about what they were getting involved with instead of rushing a product into the theaters to try and capitalize on the success of another film. One thing did stand out for me as I watched this. How short is Rob Morrow? Everyone in the film towers over him, including Stone who is no giant. Wasted effort.

He gets his disgraced black sheep brother Rick Hayes (Rob Morrow) a job. Sam Burns (Randy Quaid) gives him a meaningless job to write a report on the possibility of clemency for death row inmate Cindy Liggett (Sharon Stone) but the governor never gives clemency. Liggett committed a double murder including the son of a wealthy supporter of the governor. As Rick investigates, he gets thrown off the case. A black prisoner is given clemency for political reasons while Liggett faces death.This movie suffers badly from the comparison to 'Dead Man Walking'. Sharon Stone's performance is not horrible. This is more of a mystery about a case. The film simply doesn't do a good job with the emotional roller coaster of death row. It goes from stale to overacting. Rob Morrow is actually the lead of this film. He's not a compelling lead slipping in and out of a southern accent. The whole last act is done badly with a romantic sequence tacked on.

Apparently there was exonerating evidence kept out of her trial, about her own abuse and the fact that she was drugged and drunk when she committed the heinous crime. Sharon Stone gives a brilliant performance, but the movie as a whole feels completely unnecessary, both because Dead Man Walking dealt with the same issues a few months earlier, because the mentioned circumstances doesn't really make her any less guilty or less deserving of the death penalty for having robbed two innocent people of their lives, and ultimately because all the efforts of the young lawyer yields no results, and she's ultimately executed. The latter is, along with Sharon Stone's performance, the best thing about the movie, if you ask me, but it still feels like a 103 minute long movie about nothing. An admitted killer got what she deserved, and those closest to her, and a few others who've taken it upon themselves to care, feel sad about it. Nothing new there.

She is on death row for murders committed 10-15 years before, while under influence of alcohol, drugs, crazy boyfriend. Young hotshot lawyer (Morrow) tries to appeal, using evidence that would have cleared her, had it ever been introduced in trial. Story is actually about the struggle of love romantic, platonic, self-esteem/love of self, love of humanity/against the death penalty. Funny thing happens to this lawyer on the way to death row...he falls in love with his client/prisoner. Is love from afar, as they never have physically intimate moments, but audience can feel the love/passion/heartbreak unfold on screen. Best performance for Stone, who believably delivers line after line of heart-wrenching, white trash, prison living drama. Not only do you feel for her, and Morrow's lawyer character, but you begin to re-examine your stance on prison and the death penalty. My heart broke, and I sobbed, when she uttered the line, I ain't gonna beg for something I'm not gonna get. She is referring to the compassion and forgiveness her lawyer went to seek from her victims' families. You will struggle to keep it together during this movie, and will need time to emotionally recover afterwards. I cried as much as when I watched Saving Private Ryan. Both movies should be part of your permanent collection.
