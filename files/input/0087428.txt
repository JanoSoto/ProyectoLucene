I saw this one back in 1984 when it was first released and I loved it for the very reasons that some people here seem to hate it. It was deliciously weird. Our heroes are in an incestuous relationship, and the movie is uncritical of this. That gets the brain working from the start. Then you discover the other bizarre characters and their relationships and the movie becomes, to me at least, extremely lovable.Admittedly, Rob Lowe's acting isn't up to much, and that's glaringly obvious here, but it doesn't destroy the film, and there's great work, as usual, from Jodie Foster to compensate.Basically, this is a light-hearted, feel-good film that I would expect to have mass appeal. To top it off, it achieves this effect without being overly sentimental. That's rare. If you haven't seen it, give it a whirl. If you don't like it, keep on passing open windows.

I thought this had to be a good movie, so I checked it out on this site, and was surprised to see how bad the reviews were here.Now I've seen the film and I must say that I agree much more with the Norwegian reviewers than the users of this site (except those who gave it a good review). This movie is brilliant. Almost as good as The World According To Garp, which happens to be one of my favourite movies of all time.The excellence of these films is that they're so focused on the main characters in the movie, that you really start to know them, and care about them. This is something you don't see in many movies. Here you follow the whole family from they're young 'till they're old, and you start understanding how they've become the way they are, and why they act the way they do.As Garp, this movie is also very much focused on sex and love, and in the most bizarre ways possible. But so what? In the world there are many types of persons, why should a book or a movie just focus on the normal ones? The fact that the persons in these films are not normal makes them more acceptable and believable to the average viewer. Normal in movies normally means perfect, and very few persons are perfect... In Garp and New Hampshire the characters are not perfect, and that's what makes the films perfect...The cast also does an excellent work with their characters, everybody is believable. And the director has done an excellent job pacing the film in a way that it doesn't move too fast, and it never bores you by going to slow.All in all an excellent movie that I'd recommend to anyone who hasn't yet been completely brainwashed by Hollywood's image of perfectionism. Almost as good as Garp. If you liked Garp, you'll love this one too. And vice versa. I give this film an 8 (almost 9) out of 10.

No, seriously, that was just supposed to be a joke. The ONLY movie I know The Hotel New Hampshire can be compared to is The World According to Garp - as this one based on a novel by John Irving.Sometimes this movie makes you think that it's a mediocre and senseless one. That it's gross and abnormal. But that is John Irving! Like in Garp, sex plays a central role in New Hampshire - and it's turned upside down. In Garp, Glenn Close *raped* a dying man. In this movie, Jodie Foster is raped, she and her brother (Rob Lowe) want to make love and know that they will eventually - and they tell each other. They also tell each other everything about their sexual relationships, they talk about whom they fancy and how they should make love with them. Sex is always present in the development of the characters, but at another level as normally, i.e. as the most normal thing of the world, basically.The main reason why that strange movie works is that the characters are very interesting. They are grotesque, alright, but something makes them real. The point is, that the characters in this movie are allowed to dream and even to be really mad. However, there are frontiers to their freedom, it's just not the same frontiers as we know. They make the frontiers themselves. Their frontiers allow the siblings to make love - on ONE single looong afternoon. And that scene is not as disturbing as it is kind of beautiful and touching, because THESE characters CAN do this! It's the *radicals* in Vienna who bring us back to the real world - still in a grotesque way. Well, and there are sooo many important characters in this movie - that makes it!The actors are fabulous. Jodie Foster can never be bad, Rob Lowe is believeable and Amanda Plummer is as good as always. A real stand-out is young Jennie Dundas. About twelve or how old she was then, she looks so adult in terms. She does not have to hide opposite stars of Jodie Foster's kind here, she is really great. What she does is make a quite unreal character come to life - quietly but impressive and likeable. Well, it's no normal movie and there should not be many more of its kind. But, though confusing and gross, there are so many things that you must see. The characters, the actors, the freedom to be mad. Almost as good as Garp; there may be worse movies that I rated 8 out of 10.

But the single thread that runs through the film and ties the characters and their lives together is sorrow; and in this instance, using an extremely overt metaphor, `Sorrow' is the family pet-- a dog-- who comes to symbolize a seemingly prevalent condition of the Berry family in `The Hotel New Hampshire,' written for the screen and directed by Tony Richardson, adapted from the novel by John Irving.  The story centers on the Berry family, a close but eccentric clan, and is told from the perspective of John (Rob Lowe), who tries to make sense of his too familiar relationship with his sister, Frannie (Jodie Foster), his gay older brother, Frank (Paul McCrane), his literally `little' sister, Lilly (Jennifer Dundas) who `isn't a midget,' but who stopped growing too soon, the youngest of the bunch, Egg (Seth Green), his grandfather, Iowa Bob (Wilford Brimley) and his parents (Beau Bridges and Lisa Banes).John's father, Win, was a dreamer, or as Lilly called him, a `Gatsby,' always looking for something better, for `it.'  Win and Mother Berry had met one summer working together at a hotel, and when Win tires of his job as a school teacher, he decides their town needs a hotel.  So he buys an abandoned building that suits his needs perfectly, and transforms it into a hotel, the Hotel New Hampshire, owned and operated by the entire Berry family.  And it is here that the memories of his formative years are made for John; memories like struggling with his love for his sister while she lives through a particularly traumatic experience that involves a boy of whom she is enamored, Chip Dove (Matthew Modine), and tasting love himself for the first time with a waitress at the hotel (Joely Richardson).  It is also at this time that he experiences a death in the family for the first time.  And, as it is in life, it won't be the last; nor will it be his final encounter with tragedy and sorrow.In this film, Richardson touches upon a number of themes that at one time (and not that long ago) would have been considered taboo in a film  Homosexuality, incest and interracial relationships.  And he does it successfully by weaving them into the story naturally and objectively, without expounding upon or exploring them simply to enhance the drama.  This is simply the story of the Berry family, for better or worse, with John telling it like it is while refraining from any sensationalism or judgment calls, to which the likes of a film of this nature would ordinarily be disposed.  Lowe gives a convincing performance as John-- arguably some of the best work he's ever done-- and he underscores his role of narrator by making the story as much about the others as about himself, which is generous, and a good piece of acting.  Foster, who would've been twenty-one or twenty-two when this was filmed (1984), displays an insight, poise and maturity well beyond her years, with a performance that is intuitively discerning and believable, and which serves the character so well while bringing her vividly to life.  There is such a natural quality to Foster's acting that it makes her a joy to watch, and it makes Frannie a memorable character.  The young Dundas is also very impressive in the role of Lilly and, like Foster, manages to bring the necessary maturity to the character that makes her entirely credible.The supporting cast includes Wallace Shawn (Freud), Dorsey Wright (Junior), Cali Timmins (Bitty), Anita Morris (Ronda Ray) and Walter Massey (Texan).  The film is by turns poignant, funny and disturbing; one could say a succinct reflection of life.  And, diverse as this story is, thematically, there will undoubtedly be one aspect of it or another to which just about anyone will be able to relate.  Because that's what life is; a journey we all share, but which we take on different roads that sooner or later are bound to intersect, and which becomes the point at which we realize something that's inescapable and possibly the most important thing we will ever learn  That we are not alone in this.  And, in the final analysis, that is what `The Hotel New Hampshire' is all about.  And that's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 7/10.

The one exception is The Cider House Rules, which was rewritten for the screen by Irving himself. But The Cider House Rules is also the most toned-down of Irving's novels. From such works of grandiose fiction and fantastic imagination as A Prayer for Owen Meany and The World According to Garp, it stands out.Hotel New Hampshire is even more difficult, and as such it is a difficult novel to adapt to the screen. But I think the director has managed to do a very fine job indeed. Hotel New Hampshire is very faithful to Irving's original story, and has the same way of floating above the hardships and adventures of the family. The characters are seemingly simple but reveal deep traits of complexity in their words and actions, especially the youngest daughter Lilly and the rough Frannie, both portrayed excellently by Jennifer Dundas and Jodie Foster respectively. The father, obsessed with running a hotel, seems to lead this family on their journey, but there are greater forces at work disasters, death, political fanaticism, incest and sex. Love and compassion also play important roles, most of all the love between Frannie and John (the narrator) and the friendship between Win Berry and Freud (and Freud's bear!).The macabre humor is very typical of John Irving, who is a master at writing the deepest tragedy and still make you smile, but the humor serves a greater purpose ridicule is a way to express outrage and frustration - and Hotel New Hampshire has its share of that the rape of the ambivalent Frannie, the death of the poor old dog and the insanely funny way it refuses to release its hold on the family, the ridiculous radicals in Vienna and the tragic loss of family members. This film focuses on the humor more than the book does, but the seriousness seeps through in the right places. Excellent performances, great scenery and attention to detail added to humor and wit makes this film a very good adaptation of Irving's fascinating novel. Good work.

A lot of Irving's books have strange sexual themes, which sometimes do not translate to the big screen, and Hotel New Hampshire is one of those books. While it is one of Irving's best books, and gives a lot of history for each character, the movie left the characters shallow and undeveloped. Too bad, because a wonderful acting job by Jodie Foster was wasted on a phrenetic, nonsensical movie.

I read this book (along with  his other best-sellers World  According to Garp and Cider House Rules) back in the 80's when they were published, and I thought they were great, serious  works of fiction full of colorful, off-the wall characters fleshed out  in  engaging prose. Unfortunately, all of this is lost in this film adaptation.I don't know who Tony Richardson is, and if he directed any other movies, but if they are as poorly-lit, badly-recorded, ineptly edited, and  haphazardly narrated as this one is, I'll pass.Although the movie sticks pretty closely to the original, it just doesn't work on the screen. The first third of the book, dealing with the first  Hotel New Hampshire, is truncated into a five minute, voiced-over series of vignettes under the opening credits. This is all of the movie you need to see, because the director uses his entire bag of tricks here.We seem to enter in the middle of  a story, one everyone (except you) seems to already be familiar with. Random characters and situations are thrown at you, with no apparent continuity, sense, or  narrative flow.  When the story gets dark or uncomfortable, the director resorts to cheap gimmicks like fast-action photography. It may have been funny when the Keystone Kops did it, but it is most definitely UNfunny here.Wallace Shawn, sporting a bad wig, motorcycle jacket and towing a performing bear, shows up and just as suddenly, disappears. (We do encounter him later in the film, but now he's bald and blind, and although he's back in his native Vienna, his German accent seems to come and go mysteriously. It's also 10 or 15 years later, apparently but somehow he's the only one who is any older.)  Rob Lowe looks pretty and vapid. Jodie Foster looks sexy, talks dirty, and acts tough. Beau Bridges just looks befuddled most of the time. And the actress (whoever she is ) who plays the mother has such a tiny part that she barely registers.Incest, rape, murder, accidental death, suicide, radical German nihilists with bombs, pornography, and a lesbian in a bear suit are all in this movie, and it's all BORING.All I can recommend is that you read the book. Everything that is confusing, depressing, and just plain weird in this movie makes great, if quirky, sense in the book.

Based on a celebrated satirical novel by John Irving (author of THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP 1982 &#150; which I guess I should get to now), it garnered mixed reactions but I found it quite engaging apart from the occasional heavy-handedness; that said, having read the source material for myself, I have to say that the film falls short of extracting its full potential. There is no real plot to speak of, but a plethora of oddball characters &#150; not just the central family (among them Beau Bridges, Jodie Foster and Rob Lowe&#133;not to mention their compulsively farting dog!) but also Wallace Shawn as a cycle-riding Dr. Freud with a bear companion, Nastassja Kinski as the latter's 'replacement' after it is killed(!) and Amanda Plummer as a gawky teen dubbed Miss Carriage. The film touches on some potentially controversial subjects such as incest (Lowe is obsessed with Foster), homosexuality (of both sexes) and rape (Foster falls foul of Lowe's football buddies, led by a young Matthew Modine &#150; who actually plays two roles!). The acting is uniformly good, with Foster and Kinski (despite a limited role) coming off best. Reportedly, the rock band Queen was supposed to contribute to the soundtrack - with the song 'Keep Passing The Open Windows' (a much-repeated phrase in the film) eventually finding its way onto their album The Works from the same year.

Where the hell did that come from?!  Does anyone know?  Why would they make such a fuss over bears?  Especially the character, Suzie the Bear?  What was her deal?

It's plain obvious that even if you, like myself, haven't read John Irving's novel which this is based on, a TV series must be the only way to adapt this, if anything to fit in its vast content. I have no other explanation for this anarchistically surreal, whirlwind mess of a 110 min' film The saga of a large family of eccentrics trying to make it in the hotel business both on the American east coast and Vienna - oh, apart from all their sexual shenanigans, encounters of counterpart weirdos and inexplicable hang-ups about circus bears, of course...From the word go, I'm told not to take anything seriously (sort of like in a Fellini-world), so I don't... which has the effect that when dramatic, supposedly emotionally engaging incidents occur (gang rape, terrorism...) - I still don't! The characters feel randomly thrown into a huge tumble-dryer, spun around, taken out, some discarded, put back, spun around, etc until nobody cares, because although SO much indeed is happening, nothing is invested in them with this sloppy irregularity - not even a laugh.Too boot, we get poor sound effects (a farting dog? Hilarious... maybe for a 5-year-old!) & editing, fast-motion slapstick á la the old Benny Hill Show and over-acting to match, although Jodie Foster is always watchable. In most aspects, a truly terrible movie. Anyone think you're up for this challenge? You WOULD seriously be better off watching an old Benny Hill episode!2 out of 10 from Ozjeppe.

I've read all of his books, including his classic novel, THE HOTEL NEW HAMPSHIRE. The book is an epic, funny, and shocking read, especially for it's time, and yet it lives on as a memorable, unique, and powerful piece of literature. It is probably one of my favorite books by him. If you're a book person, I highly recommend it. This film is an attempt to put the book in film form. Did they succeed? Well, yes and no. Yes in that they managed to squeeze a lot of events and content contained in the book into a very tight hour and fifty minutes. However the filmmaker failed to tell a story. The director, Tony Richardson managed to succeed at getting an idea established, craft characters, events, situations, and characteristics in a way that that makes sense, and has created epic set pieces for these characters to do this things in. However, he has not set up any sort of perspective, conflict, or reason for a person to view this. I do, however, recommend it. The major flaw in this film is that there is too much stuff happening and not enough reason for the viewer to pay attention or care. In a sense, however, he has succeeded at putting images behind the shocking and horrific events of the book. I'm not sure, however, if I should be complimenting him for this. This film certainly gets the grotesque nature of the book down perfectly. The aspects of incest, rape, sexual fetishes, domination, murder, and brutality are captured rather bluntly and without any reservations. Those aspects were done perfectly. However, do I really want to see a film of THE HOTEL NEW HAMPSHIRE that highlights THOSE parts of the book rather than the events as a whole? I guess, yes, in a sense, because the events of THE HOTEL NEW HAMPSHIRE did get to me and did put images in my head that bothered me, and the fact that this film has these same images does much to help me identify with what's going on. However, the film also tries to comedy, and as a result it all seems more shocking. But after a while, it all becomes shock for shocks sake. The film adaptation of THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP didn't try to capture all of these horrible and shocking things that occurred within the course of the book but rather set those aside in order to concentrate on telling a story and crafting characters. It didn't work as well as it could of, but it worked in that a hell of a lot more that what the filmmakers try to go for in this. Having said that, I do love this film. As flawed as it is and as misguided as it is as a whole, I loved seeing the characters, events, and tone being in film form. The acting jobs by all the players, the look, the tone, and the general premise all translate very well. If there were a story, I would have an easier time recommending it, but I think I will have to say that this is worth seeing by fans of John Irving's book only.

The only really great moment, is when the older brother says (without revealing anything of the movie) I am you know, and his siblings warmly and without comment say that they know.  That was sweet, simple, warm and believable, revealing depth of character never again seen.  Instead we get bizarre and inane scenes, sappy music, slapstick comedy, hundreds of plots thrown in a blender, and sad attempts at drama.There are so many issues, and possible themes here, familial violence, homosexual assault, gang rape, interracial relationships, pedophilia (waitress and John, come on, both sexes can be abused and confused by it!), prostitution, bestiality, incest, violent death, family relations, terrorism, promiscuity, pornography, sexual confusion...blah blah blah.

It always amazes me how a book as good as A Prayer for Owen Meany could be turned into a film as bad as Simon Birch. With The Cider-House Rules Lasse Hallstrom managed to pull off his normal trick of turning everything he touches into pure treacle. The film of The World According to Garp left me with the feeling What the hell was that all about? .I think that the difficulty is that Irving's books do not always transfer well to the screen. They tend to be long, discursive, dealing with several different themes and with complicated plots and large casts of characters. These factors do not always make a novel unfilmable- there have, for example, been some great films based on the works of Dickens, a writer whom Irving greatly admires. In the case of Irving, however, film directors seem to struggle to find any equivalent to his authorial voice to hold his rather sprawling stories together.The plot of The Hotel New Hampshire would be difficult to summarise. It revolves around the Berry family and their five children, John, Franny, Frank, Lilly, and Egg. (He began as an egg and he still is an egg. I hope you're happy with that explanation because it's the only one you're going to get). In the 1950s, the Berrys run a New Hampshire hotel which, with startling originality, they call the Hotel New Hampshire. Later on, for no good reason, they move to Vienna and run a hotel there which they also name the Hotel New Hampshire. (I say for no good reason, but the real reason is that Irving himself had lived in Vienna as a student and couldn't resist featuring the city in his book). The film also features a performing bear, a dead dog, a plane crash, a dwarf who is also a successful author, terrorism, rape, incest, homosexuality and suicide. Have you got all that?One or two of the cast are quite good, such as Beau Bridges as Win, the Berry paterfamilias, Rob Lowe as John, the eldest son and the film's narrator, and Wilford Brimley as Iowa Bob, the crusty old grandfather, but not all are of the same standard. A lot of Jodie Foster's films from the early and mid-eighties tended to suggest that she was fated to spend her adult acting career in the shadow of Taxi Driver and her other childhood successes, and this is one of them. As Franny she never really does much to suggest that later in the decade, around the time of The Accused, she would emerge as one of Hollywood's top young actresses. The opening titles actually refer to Nastassja Kinski as Susie the Bear; when I first saw the film I remember thinking well, that'll make a change from 'Tess of the D'Urbervilles'! In fact, Nastassja does not actually play the performing bear, who is played by a real bear. Her character Susie is a young woman who prefers to dress up as a bear because she does not like being a young woman very much.The Hotel New Hampshire is not my favourite Irving novel; it is not, for example, in the same class as Owen Meany. I did, nevertheless, enjoy it a lot more than I did the film. Director Tony Richardson is never able to make us believe in the idiosyncrasies of the various characters or to make us see any connection between the various disparate incidents that make up the plot. It is difficult to know what the film is about. Two characters have an incestuous affair, but it is not a film about incest. Another character is gay, but it is not about homosexuality. Another commits suicide (without any real explanation being given), but it is not about suicide. One is raped, but it is not about rape. Another is injured in a terrorist incident, but it is not about terrorism. Two more die in a plane crash, but it is not about air safety. Susie may dress as a bear, but it is not really about ursine transvestism. One could say of the book that it is about all these things (except perhaps air safety); the most one can say of the film that it mentions all these things but is not actually about any of them. 5/10 "},{"Title":"First Rate","Date":"7 February 2012","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" The film is John Irving weird and thus delightful in its way.

In particular, Jodie Foster, Rob Lowe and Alan Bates all excel, but the talented Natassia Kinski, who spends most of the film wearing a bear costume, is sadly wasted here and occasionally the viewer gets the feeling that she would have preferred not to have been there at all. Drifting from hotel to hotel, the family loses some of its members along the way but collects waifs and strays to replace them. The characters develop as their fortunes waiver, and the will-they-or-won't-they? relationship between John and his sister Frannie is an uncomfortable undercurrent which runs throughout the film.

Rob Lowe plays the pretty boy brother who lusts for his sister's body, Frannie. There is a little boy named Egg, because he started as an egg and still is an egg.

The result is that everyone and everything looks retarded in The Hotel New Hampshire. Worst of all is that everyone is hopelessly miscast. Beau Bridges looks like an older brother, not a mature father figure who can run a hotel. Jodie Foster is too pasty, pudgy and asexual to attract gnats.

The plot is impossible to follow without confusion. There are in fact 147 different plots, each more absurd than the last. The most absurd being the campy terrorists whose plot is never explained. Characters die and their family members never seem sad. It's impossible to tell how much time has passed. Characters wander in and out without explanation. The dialog and characters are laughable and totally unbelievable. Even good actors like Jodie Foster are awkward and are always a beat off.The slapstick attempts at humor made me cringe (to say nothing of the incest.) The gang rape and multiple deaths of family members made me laugh, because I didn't believe in the characters or the situations.When Jodie Foster's character is raped I was disturbed for a moment. But when her brother and a gang of black students rush to the rescue, and Foster's character makes some crack about same old Halloween I laughed. I laughed harder when they bring her home and she just wants to recover from the experience by cuddling with dog...WHO THE FATHER HAS JUST HAS PUT TO SLEEP. The girl is gang raped and her father put the dog to sleep without telling her. This is better than Degrassi or other after school specials, and cannot be taken at all seriously.Perhaps some things were meant to be surreal or blackly humorous, but none of the humor or the surreal impossibility of the many plots seemed intentional.Perhaps Irving is a good writer, but I wonder after the campy mess of an acid trip of this film and the soppy diabetic mess of Simon Birch.

Came across the film some time later and to be honest, wasn't expecting it to do much justice to John Irvings finest.. it's a great film though and I think manages that rare feat of capturing a lot of the books essence and charm without massacring the storyline in the process. When it's funny you laugh and when it's sad you pipe your eye-Yes, I admit it! Why not?! The Berry family in 'The Hotel New Hampshire' struck a chord in me on the page first of all, then endeared themselves to me further on the screen. The film has ever since remained my absolute favourite and shall continue to for as long as I can keep on glimpsing bits of myself and my close family/friends in many of the characters, the good AND bad bits. And be moved by each Berry family members particular 'journey' through life, searching for their own personal 'it' - happiness & contentment.. Cos y'know what they say;'Love floats too..just like Sorrow..' But unfortunately thats also the case with canine flatulence so I guess we could say we're all in various perpetual states of a)Love b)Sorrow or c)Flatulence in life at various stages in it..... but p'raps t'wud be just as well if we Didn't say it though...? ;-' "},{"Title":"An orthodox liberal vision of family values","Date":"14 January 2004","Score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  The Hotel New Hampshire stands the test of time.  It's liberal values and easy going reactions to violent events remain fascinating even a generation later.  The family the film revolves around possesses geniuses at every level. They possess idealistic visions and fantastical ideals. They are dreamers and achievers. Revenge is a most definite trait. They accept the horrors and sorrows of life except,they will not accept defeat.   They have chosen not to go down the road to conformity but down the avenue of enlightenment.  The family's spirit is strongly intact and held within a bubble of existence.It is actually true of all families.  We all just live in different bubbles with our collective.  John Irvings story seems to be asking what if? Jodie Foster gets rape but recovers with strength and courage.  Her family accepts the act as boys will be boys especially when your daughter is a tomboy.  Responding in a more educated sense; life will go on. Rob Lowe had a great time getting laid.  He is the perfect pretty boy to be pursued. The love interest between Sister and brother was a challenging moral to question.  The film plays it out innocently but the audience gets the sense of an attraction and a possible acceptance of it.The films questions fame, love, revenge, sex, death, etc....It contains elements of bisexuality, homosexuality, and incest.  It touches on life in a pagan sort of way.  Love one another and be all that you can be.  Do not let life's little worries distract you from this.  Accept the good with the bad.The film loses itself more toward the end as if they were trying hard to finish it.  The translation to screen must have been a difficult project. Overall, The Hotel New Hampshire is a fun, witty, and daring film with delightful performances.  Jodie Foster is a fine performer.  I am from that generation.  It is a perfect film for nostalgia.

The impact was so great that I still remember it to this day, something no other film achieved.Even with all the new plane crash movies that have come out lately such as Turbulence, Passenger 64, Air Force One, etc - it is the plane explosion scene in this movie that always stays in the back of my mind when I am flying through the night...I would definitely recommend renting it on video... the characters are superb and you do indeed end up caring about them throughout the movie.

I can't believe the voting! You just got to sit down and immerse yourself in the family. Forget what you expect films to do and forget what you expect films to say. Just watch it! It is completely engrossing! It is the tragic tale of a family which just doesn't seem to have any luck. It is a fantasy film set in a modern time. It tells of the life and times of a family beset with disaster and misfortune. There are strange occurences and even stranger characters, such as Natasha Kinjski who dresses up as a bear. It sounds wierd, I know, I can't explain it to anybody without them thinking I've gone mad, but it all makes perfect sense when you watch it. Believe me, hire it out and sit down for a couple of hours. You'll love it!

Though I've never read the John Irving novel this disaster is based on, Richardson's hatchet job on Evelyn Waugh's Hollywood satire would suggest Irving's book is considerably better than the film. It couldn't be worse. None of the characters are remotely believable and the plot devices are acid flashbacks reminiscent of dreadful 60s films like Myra Breckinridge. Avoid at all costs.

Critically mauled, this is a wonderful, if uneven hodge-podge of brilliant scenes of tragic, humour and erotic. With Jodie Foster as sexy as she has never been before and afterwards, Rob Lowe genuinely charming, a likeable Beau Bridges and a lot of fun.

I was the only person in the theater laughing during this movie. But I knew I was right and that everyone was an uncultured, provincial idiot. Sorry, but it is the truth.This film is amazingly fast moving. It packs just about every detail from a very long novel into a not-especially-long film. But pay attention. If you go to get popcorn, you'll miss a lot.Jodie Foster's Frannie is fantastic! (But, as Matthew Modine says, it's her ass that's really special!)

No doubt, those who have rated this garbage highly find it Real Interesting to watch a young Jodie Foster and a young Rob Lowe acting as brother and sister somehow inexplicably being in love with each other and having sex. These same viewers are also apparently endlessly entertained watching idiots in bear costumes, shallow phony Viennese revolutionaries and a hundred other pointless, disjointed vignettes. However, if you are someone who Has A Life, you'll give up like me after about an hour and just fast-forward through the rest of this crap and hope to find an interesting scene. Hint you won't. Save yourself and avoid this movie, there's a reason why it wallows in obscurity.
