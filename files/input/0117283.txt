It manages to successfully capture the elusive appeal that David Schwimmer has from time to time; it's easy for his sad-sack personality to grow annoying and pathetic, but this script managed to walk that line.  The scenes of embarrassment and shame never seem overdone or cheap, and serve the story well.  I especially like the down-to-earth, realistic beauty that Gwyneth Paltrow always brings to a role; she never seems like a movie star playing a real person.  Because of Schwimmer's brief tenure as a star with buzz, this was seen as a box office failure, but it was never the kind of movie likely to rake in huge bucks.  For what it is, a small, thoughtful, offbeat romantic comedy, The Pallbearer is a winner.

Tom gets a call from a woman who mistakenly believes he knew her recently deceased son. He goes along with it, presumably to save her the added grief of knowing her son had no close friends. Of course, Tom's accommodating nature backfires and he's asked to give the eulogy for a man he never knew. This sets up a scene with the kind of dark humor seen throughout the movie that audiences are either delighted with or immediately turned off by.At the funeral, Tom meets Julie, his unrequited high school crush, played with genuine emotion and winsome grace by Gwyneth Paltrow. Thus begins two relationships that play out over the duration of the film --one with Grace, the bereft mother of the friend Tom never had, played by Barbara Hershey, and the other with Julie.Yes, this movie owes much, in terms of plot and characters, to The Graduate, with Hershey playing the counterpart to Anne Bancroft's Mrs. Robinson. But it turns out to be much more than just an update of the '60s classic. The audience really gets to know the inner turmoil both Tom and Julie are going through -- Tom, both for the guilt of becoming unwittingly involved with Grace, and for also being involved with Julie at the same time, and Julie, for being torn between striking out on her own to escape her overbearing parents and getting into a deep relationship with Tom.There are a couple of sideplots going on with Tom's friends -- Michael Rapaport's character getting married to a woman his friends don't like, and Michael Vardan's married character, making a move on Julie, which obviously infuriates Tom. And Carol Kane as Tom's mom, is precious. In one scene, he is livid after she bursts into his room unannounced. After she receives a brief scolding for not knocking, she replies I only wanted to see if you wanted some ice cream, to which he replies A little. Schwimmer nails the role, with his underplayed, tacit sadness about his so-far-failed attempt at making a responsible life for himself. And Paltrow, well, can she ever miss? Whether for the dark humor, spot-on acting, or superb soundtrack, this one is definitely worth a viewing.

A graduate (Tom, played by David Schwimmer), only one year later, has an affair with an older woman. She is the mother of a dead guy named Bill. Tom did not know Bill but the mother thinks he was his best friend. He plays along. The affair starts but Tom is really in love with a younger girl named Julie (Gwyneth Paltrow). So far this is a lot like The Graduate and in my opinion this wasn't a good part of the movie although it had its funny scenes.The comparison with The Graduate holds on in the main plot-line may be, but The Pallbearer takes a different way in the way it is shown to us. I liked how the movie developed from that moment on. Especially the ending is well-chosen.David Schwimmer was a better lead than I expected, he wasn't that bad. Most funny scenes were happening because of him. Gwyneth Paltrow was lovely and for me she made sure I liked the movie a little more.

A sort of serious romantic comedy. I loved Barbara Hershey in this. She never disappoints. Playing the mother of a son she lost, she turns to companionship to help heal the loss. David Schwimmer, Ross in FRIENDS, helps her out. Schwimmer does an admirable job as a young man, almost a virgin in relationships.Then he meets the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow and sparks begin to fly. So, the plot thickens when he's up against the two ladies in his life. Add another lady, Carol Kane, his mother, who does a brilliant job as she fawns over her son. She's a riot and brings what little comedy there is to the movie.Friends to Schwimmer are played by Michael Rapaport as a groom to be, with advice for his friend, and Michael Vartan, who I have liked since THE NEXT BEST THING. They both add much to this movie.Not really a comedy, as the acting is quite real and often touching, but enjoyable to watch the two stars in the leads and an excellent supporting cast.

I find this characterization wildly inappropriate. Although it does have its comedic moments at the beginning (the funeral scenes are reminiscent of The Big Chill and the Chuckles the Clown episode of Mary Tyler Moore, the film smoothly evolves into a poignant story of Tom Thompson's(Schwimmer)search for the meaning of his life. He is hindered in part by his inability to get past an unrequited love in high school (played by Paltrow). Schwimmers's body language is so in tune to the emptiness of his character. His journey reminds me, once again of another film - Benjamin Braddock in The Graduate. Tom has three friends who give the appearance of having figured things out, but demonstrate their own frailties before the film is done. Barbara Hershey, in the role of the mother of the deceased, initially earns no sympathy, but by end of the film, there is more understanding, of if not empathy her character. (By the way, I mean no criticism in comparing this film or its characters to other film.)Don't see this film if you're looking for a light-hearted comedy. It's not Friends or Shallow Hall. It's a thoughtful film with an especially sweet performance by David Schwimmer.

The film was Schwimmer's first attempt at non-'Friends' success but it bombed terribly at the box office and as a result remains unusual and unique in that so far it is his only attempt to carry a picture. I'm hesitant to call a it a star vehicle because it also features Gwenyth Paltrow but that is essentially what it is, or at least tries/was meant to be.I actually like this movie but I would have found it ultimately forgettable if it hadn't been constantly shown on one of the more obscure digital TV channels late at night just as I was coming in from work for a 6 month period a few years back.It has a good and recognisable cast which will put an audience at ease. Rappaport is as usual very funny and Schwimmer plays a very 'Ross'-esque character, given a ridiculous hair cut so that we can obviously differentiate from his 'Friends' persona. Paltrow looks cute and does what she does best.....pouts a lot.The plot itself centres around Schwimmer's character attempting to negotiate a relationship beyond friendship with his high school crush (Paltrow) who he has not been in contact with for years, presumably as he has only recently returned from completing his college studies. This is somewhat hindered though as he has also become intimately involved with the grieving mother of a recently deceased local man played by Barabra Hershey who believes, wrongly, that Schwimmer's character was her departed son's best , and for that matter only, friend at high school. As he is looking for some excitement in life Scwimmer's character was more than willing to maintain this incorrect assumption in order to bed the vulnerable Hershey character but after peddling the deception to the point where he delivers the eulogy at her son's funeral (at which he is also a Pallbearer hence the film's title) guilt begins to catch up with him and the 'Graduate'-esqu style of excitement he had previously felt is replaced by regret. There is also the underlying feeling to which many can probably relate of a post graduate who is struggling to move on with his life. This of course summons further comparisons with the earlier mentioned 'Graduate' from which this picture obviously draws major though not overly obvious influences.Tom Thompson (Schwimmer) has achieved an architectural degree but is struggling to find employment in the field and is back living in his old bedroom at his mother's house which looks , and where he is treated, like he is still at high school. To make matters worse his friends who live near by are all in 9-5 jobs and have all moved on with their lives to the point they are either married or engaged and are considering starting families. The relationship with Hershey seems to give a feeling of maturity whilst the reemergence of Paltrow has allowed him to recall happier and simpler times in his life where he wasn't under so much pressure to grow up.The story itself can be viewed as simplistic and not very exciting but it was matched by the slow pace. I myself actually appreciated it but maybe thats because I found relevance to my own life. Either way the audience can get some enjoyment out of the actor's performances and some sharp dialogue and set pieces. There are also some nice directorial touches though the film is not what you would call stylistic or a talky for that matter.Shwimmer's dead-pan comedic tone and facial expressions worked as well here as they do in 'Friends'. I felt he was just right for the role and enjoyed his performance. Though I accept that he is not to everyone's taste and for that reason many people will probably not enjoy this movie. Being a Shwimmer fan here is not a necessity but it certainly helps.On the whole this is the kind of film which works well at entertaining in a kind of personal way and in a subdued setting IE.- late at night in your living room with nothing else on or perhaps a rainy Saturday afternoon. It would have been an extremely unsatisfying cinematic event though and that is probably where most of the bad press for it comes from.Definitely not perfect but none the less a decent film which is made all the more worth while if you approach it with low expectations like I did.The underlying theme is about facing up to the difficulty of that crossroads in life when we realise that perhaps its time to move on from being a carefree youth to a mature adult. If that interests you then I guess this movie you will appreciate.

Pleasant would best describe this film with easy music and nice scenes and lots of scene changes it carries well. Somewhat nostalgic in feeling. A special mix here is the good fortune of Tom Thompson (David Schwimmer) that his actions are always amplified as altruistic.

Unfortunately The Pallbearer doesn't deliver--there are some moments which are undeniably funny, though the eulogy mentioned in the tag line wasn't one of them. The plot is a little thin to hang a movie on, in fact it might have been better done as an episode of Friends, about twenty minutes could have handled the whole thing. There's an immense amount of filler here--long, excruciating shots of David Schwimmer and his goofy expression as he tries to pretend he knows the poor loser from high school, recently deceased, that he can't remember, but is asked to act as pallbearer for. Everyone in this movie seems to be in one form of pain or another--Paltrow keeps repeating how she has to leave, but really doesn't explain why, in fact part of the plot seems to be her inability to explain why. Those who like romantic comedies should stay away, for those who like just plain dark comedies might want to look elsewhere as well; question is whether a couple of funny moments in an otherwise dull bleak movie is worth the time.

Although there were comic moments, the movie also explored deeper terrain, and was all the better for it. I thought Pallbearers presented a seamless blend of humor and some poignant stuff about the angsty, turbulent ethos of the early 20's. David Schimmer was neurotic, charming, endearing, and overall fantastic in the lead role (shades of Woody Allen) and the supporting actors were all convincing in theirs. I also thought that the soundtrack fit the movie perfectly, providing the perfect backdrop for tones that were simultaneously wistful, bittersweet, romantic, and humorous.

Those of you who've sat through countless indie films will realize how incredibly hard this is to do in practice. You push this tone too much, you run the risk of looking overly self indulgent or pompous...The Pallbearer doesn't look either of these---it manages to effectively convey the main character's sad existence, the lack of dreams he has for himself, as well as the realization that he's going to need some if he ever wants to get out of his mom's house in Brooklyn.That it manages to set this up while pursuing an unrequited love plot line----schwimmer meets up with his long term high school crush at a social function and resumes pining for her (and yes this was Gwenyth Paltrow's first major role at the time i believe)--while slowly realizing that he could actually date her if he wanted to--which he then attempts to and slowly but surely fumbles away. Its his fumbling that actually makes this plot line work--because his character has such lack of confidence in his abilities to do anything successfully you can almost see how he's just completely sabotaging this relationship up almost as a default setting.The plot borrows a strong ingredient from The Graduate--In short order Schwimmer's character ends up bedding a much older woman---and a much more dominant one as well--but i think his relationship with her comes from a different place then Dustin Hoffman's reasons for bedding Mrs. Robinson in The Graduate. Schwimmer's character feels like a loser, so he acts like a loser, so he continues to live like a loser--perpetuating the cycle--its not exactly an act of rebellion or an act of concern about his future the way it was for Hoffman---but still its a key plot point of The Graduate and the two films similarities in plot and tone are hard to overlook---and yet The Pallbearer got to me in a way that The Graduate never did. Maybe its because The Pallbearer is more contemporary (although not too contemporary--if it was done today--schwimmer's character would spend all of his time on message boards on the internet for sure.) but i definitely felt this film strike a nerve deep within me far more painfully then The Graduate did.This film also was the first one produced by none other then JJ Abrams--2 years before Felicity made its debut on TV--and a full 8 years before LOST premiered. It was also written by frequent TV writer Jason Katims (he of Friday Night Lights, Boston Public, Roswell, and various other rather uncommonly well written television shows concerning modern wayward youth) and directed by Matt Reeves who went on to direct Cloverfield and Let Me In (which is odd because the only horror this film has is completely in the abstract societal sense.) Either way--there was a lot of major talent involved behind the making of this film that was just starting out here for the first time--and i truly believe it to be a far more noteworthy film not only because of that but also because this movie was completely ahead of its time in showing you the whole twenty somethings who don't know what to do with their life stage of life---and also a truly underrated film on its own merits worthy of study and a true successor to The Graduate (and the fact that it'll prob never be seen as such largely sucks.)

She invites him to be a pallbearer at the funeral.At the same time, Tom, who doesn't seem to have social graces at all, meets a young woman, Julie DeMarco, from his past. He always liked her, but being shy, never told her about the way he felt about her. All this happens at the time when Tom is trying to enlist his friends, Brad and Scott, to accompany him to the funeral. Little prepare Tom for the embarrassment he undergoes while delivering the eulogy. After all, he doesn't even remember the dead man! To make matters worse, Julie, who knew the late Bill Abernathy, is appalled at the spectacle she sees.The Pallbearer, based on David Lipsky's novel, which we never read, was adapted for the screen by Matt Reeves, who also directs, and Jason Katims. The film evokes other films, specially certain aspects of The Graduate, or even the hit television series Friends, in which the leading man, had a prominent role. After watching the movie, we are going to make the point of reading the book, because it appears this work didn't quite translate to the screen, as conceived by its creator.What the film has going for itself is the interesting cast assembled for it. Never having been a fan of David Schwimmer, we have to admit he does a decent job because he is playing against type. Gwyneth Paltrow's take on Julie doesn't quite come across, but she always gives good readings in anything she appears. The surprise was Barbara Hershey, who as Mrs. Abernathy brings substance to a role that could have been a caricature with another, less experienced actress.The excellent supporting role is about the best thing in the movie. Michael Rappaport, a versatile actor, gives a fine performance as Tom's best friend. The amazing Carol Kane is never seen too long, but has a couple of funny scenes as Tom's mother.

It's incredibly obvious throughout the film that the photography was guided by the masterful Robert Elswit, showing early signs of the brilliance that has made him an Oscar winner, and the additional eyes of Paul Thomas Anderson.They incredibly mis-marketed this film, and thus there was a Friends audience running to the theatre to see something that was far too dark for liking.

Not getting the conventional romantic comedy was what I liked most about this well written and darkly hilarious film. In THE PALLBEARER, we are shown the effect that Gwyneth Paltrow's character has on David Shwimmer's character. In the end, Tom's the guy we're meant to focus on, not Julie, or even the relationship between the two. Even if the general consensus is that this film is sub-par, I'll have to stick to my conclusion that THE PALLBEARER was an exceptionally made black comedy.

Schwimmer is at the center of this slow moving, somewhat quirky flick about a young man who lives with his mother (Bosco anyone?) and courts a demure unassured girl (Paltrow) while having an affair with an older woman (Hershey).  Most will find it difficult to get their head into this off-kilter story and its subtle tongue-in-cheek humor though it remains loyal to its purpose throughout...whatever that may be.

I never watched Friends, and I appreciate that the film's flavour will for many viewers will be overlaid with Schwimmer's earlier persona. Viewing it in isolation as I did, I found it a staple comedy scenario the excruciating complications that arise from a character's lack of assertiveness in failing to admit a situation of mistaken identity. However, the joke grows increasingly uncomfortable for Tom, this unassertiveness is pathological, related to his failure to grow up. His friends have careers and relationships, but he still lives with his mother, jobless and fixated on a woman he liked at school. In real life, it would be inconceivable for such a person to end up with Gwyneth Paltrow, and the film doesn't strain our disbelief in this respect. This is less a romantic comedy than a rite-of-passage story, Tom beginning (we hope) a belated journey to adulthood. "},{"Title":"Not as bad as some say.

You can't exactly shove her out of the way, because she's old; and if you were being charitable you might say that the ponderous gait she ambles along with isn't really her fault. Nevertheless, in these circumstances it's often difficult not to become irritated when you find yourself dragging your heels in her wake. So it is with The Pallbearer, an attempt to do something 'different' with a romantic comedy that in this way is chiefly hamstrung because the venue is all wrong; sort of like showing off your 'breakdancing' skills at a grandparent's funeral.To further extend the metaphor (perhaps unwisely!); like the old lady, one starts to feel with the set-up of the film that its demise cannot be far away. Sure enough, this particular 'death' is agonizingly protracted, slowly chipping away at our reserves of empathy in tiny little increments, as depressingly we come to the realisation that the proceedings are only headed in one direction Downhill. Its laboured attempts at 'humour' can be seen coming a mile off - again, not unlike the grim inevitability of death!Returning once again to the image of 'dragging heels', the main character, Tom, is shown to ceaselessly repeat this action throughout his life. If there are indeed degrees of 'pathetic', then this sap is possibly a good few notches ahead of Schwimmer's other - more famous - role. To find oneself in the awkward position of having to align audience sympathies with a character even MORE 'clueless' than Ross is certainly a tough ask even for as 'able' a comic performer as Schwimmer, but I guess he can find fault with himself for signing on to some seriously 'echoing' situations in the first place.How will he ever escape his most famous portrayal if he's picking scripts where the characters could almost be 'interchangeable', even if the situations aren't? A man with a longstanding high-school crush on someone he hasn't seen for years. Sound familiar... ? Paltrow is nothing else if not bland in her 'Rachel' role, but all of this going over old ground would perhaps be forgivable if the noticeable DIFFERENCES present weren't so incongruous as well. Unfortunately, the romantic element is so well-worn it's threadbare, and the 'backdrop' is so inappropriate that it seems the best way to describe the resultant film is as something of a 'stiff'... ! 2/10.

It's major fault is that it tries to be something it clearly isn't - an intelligent social drama of a comedy. This is nothing more than an excuse for TV-star Schwimmer to pull as many confused/hurt/rejected faces as possible. If it just concentrated in providing the viewer with 90 minutes' trashy escapism it could have got away with its many flaws. However the film lingers far too much on everyday events, portraying them as though this is groundbreaking cinema. Paltrow is as wooden as an old garden shed, and the supporting cast were...sorry, don't recall a single one having any impact whatsoever.A potential popcorn piece is sadly a misguided miserable mess.

It wants to be Harold and Maude, Annie Hall, The Graduate. It wants to be deep and human. It has interesting camera shots, lighting, music, editing, all of which give it the feel of an important movie. The dialog is smart -- at times. There are some laugh out loud moments.But here's what keeps it from ultimately being anything more than a formulaic late-night-cable, in-flight, time-killer 1. David Schwimmer -- how many times can Joe sad-sack puppy dog stare blankly into space with his jaw hanging open before it starts to get annoying? Maybe some drool would have helped.2. Gwenneth Paltrow -- she's really flat here and not just in the chest. Her role is supposed to be this lively, nice, caring girl who just keeps getting herself into wrong situations, is very confused as a result, and that is why a sad-sack loser like Schwimmer has any chance with her. But Gwenneth plays her very dull. Combine this with puppy-dog drool-face (above) and you have very little chemistry to care about.(I kept picturing someone else in this role -- Kate Hudson for example.) 3. The script and the plot -- the stuff that happens just basically doesn't ring true; all the problems get wrapped up in the end with such a neat and tidy bow on top that it seems like a whistle blew and the script writers just said oops, time to wrap it up, got a train to catch! So they pulled out the Hollywood formula book, checked off all the boxes, and went home.

He seemed sad and radiated negative energy throughout. The film would be so much better if his character was more positive. After all, people who goes to see a movie, especially a romantic comedy, wants to feel good.Gwyneth Paltrow, on the other hand, was developed to be a likable, ordinary girl. however, I felt that she was underused in this film. Well, this may be because she was yet to be famous when this film was made. Ms Abernathy, played by Barbara Hershey, was very well portrayed. I don't recall seeing her before. Her face, especially her eyes, reminded me of Jessica Lange.The story was not so likable, and the name of the film might put people off watching it.
