[{"Title":"Magnificent cinematic medieval chess game, with every intricate move superbly thought out.","Date":"1 March 2001","Score":"118 out of 130 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, History","Review":"  The Lion in Winter is a crowning achievement in cinematic story-telling. Adapted by Oscar-winning James Goldman from his witty, triumphant 1966 Broadway play that originally starred Robert Preston and Tony-winner Rosemary Harris, the story evolves around aging King Henry II mulling over a successor to the Plantagenet throne among his male progeny, while bringing his estranged, hateful clan together for the Christmas holidays.Sparks really do fly in this wickedly elaborate chess game as the  family player pieces weave thick webs of deceit and hatch insidious plots against each another, forming unholy, protean alliances that put those Survivor contestants to shame.  The pure joy comes from seeing all of them try to outmaneuver each other with every new and different playing piece put on or taken off the board, hatching alternative schemes as fast as one can say Long live the King!Robust, boisterous Peter O'Toole is a raging marvel as the battered but not yet beaten monarch, agonizing over the untrusting, Machiavellian-like brood he's sired, yet relishing the absolute power he holds and dangles over them. The glorious O'Toole is alternately barbarous and bombastic in one of the best roles of his career, and his loss of the Academy Award over, of all people, John Wayne, remains a travesty of justice.The king's brood includes eldest son and heir-apparent, Richard (known as The Lion-hearted) whose fierce courage and burly warrior stance masquerades a forbidden tenderness detrimental to his standing as a king.  Anthony Hopkins, in an auspicious screen debut, embodies these tortuous complexities within Richard perfectly, especially in his scenes as mummy's favorite. The youngest and pruniest of the three princes is John, a rumpled, drooling, inane man-child impossibly spoiled as the King's favorite, played to pathetic amusement by a terrific Nigel Terry.  Neglected middle son, Geoffrey, excellently portrayed with jaded, sliver-eyed cunning by John Castle, is a human blueprint of treachery and deceit.  Resentful at being overlooked as even a possible contender, he's willing to sell his parents and brothers down the river for exact change.Also invited to Christmas court is King Phillip II of France, on a revenge mission himself, who locks horns with Henry over lost lands and becomes a willing participant in these under-handed games.  Timothy (007) Dalton drips with smug, venal charm as the slender, softer, inexperienced king who can only battle Henry with words and wit, not weight.  The only unblemished pawn here is Alais, the King's adoring young mistress, who is maliciously thrown to the lions by all as lady-in-waiting bait for the dueling princes. Demure, fragile Jane Merrow is the perfect choice for this innocent songbird with nothing and everything to loseI have saved the best performance for last.  As the King most duplicitous irritant, the inimitable Katharine Hepburn portrays Henry's duly banished Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine with all the unparalleled skill and inspired passion imaginable.  Handed on a silver platter the lion's share of the best lines, Hepburn more than delivers the goods here, stealing the ripe proceedings from her talented co-stars.  To watch her consummate Eleanor is to see the art of acting in its most passionate form.  She is a revelation of perks and prods, of vibrant colors and shadings.  She inhabits the passion, the power, the breeding, the deceitfulness, the desperate longing owed this character.  Imprisonment (for inciting rebellions against her husband), has not dampened the fighting spirit nor dulled the sharp, calculating mind of this Queen.  As in chess, this player is the game's most venturesome and versatile piece, and Hepburn more than lives up to its reputation, a worthy opponent with the best odds to check-mate her King. I have been known to say that the four-time Oscar winner was awarded for all the wrong movies -- excepting this one.  She is unforgettable.Topped with a glorious, inspiring, sometimes furious score (Oscar-winner John Barry), The Lion in Winter makes up for its stark, one-note surroundings with its bold, rich characters and ingenuous plotting.  It is a hallmark of Gothic temperament and tone. As the old adage goes, it's not who wins, it's how you play the game.  'Tis so true.  So let the games begin!

I've been shocked at some of the negative comments by other viewers. I was quite young when the movie came out, and didn't realize for years that Peter O'Toole wasn't the fifty year old he was playing, and Hepburn was exactly Eleanor's age at the time, so I fail to see the age mismatched some have mentioned. I'm fifty myself now, and I still find O'Toole perfectly plausible as a fifty year old in this movie. (Although, DAMN, he looked GOOD! What a gorgeous man!)As for the 'anachronistic dialog,' it was extremely intentional and would have been totally wrong without it. To our ears, the possibly more elegant speech of the period would have sounded unnatural; only by using modern language could these people sound to us as they would have sounded to each other - normal.The acting is brilliant - it would have been very hard to find any other actor who could share a screen with Hepburn without fading away to nothing, or an actress who could have done the same with O'Toole - only two of such power could stand up to one another. And this was absolutely right for these characters - as best we know, Henry and Eleanor were both that kind of person - brilliant, witty, strong-willed powerhouses. Then the supporting cast Hopkins, Castle, Terry, and Dalton. Granted, they weren't known at the time, so Harvey, the director, may not have realized right off the bat that he had the cast of a lifetime, but he surely must have realized it fast.Then there's the script. Like most of Oscar Wilde's plays, you could pick it up, open it to any page, and find at least half a dozen quotable lines. No, people aren't normally that witty in real life, but a) these were VERY bright people as historical fact, and b) it's a play/movie! People don't speak in real life as they do in Oscar Wilde either, but it's enjoyable as hell to watch. Get over it!Some things I love about the movie are that it's made clear that no matter what Henry tells Alys, Eleanor, or himself for that matter, his real love and true equal is always Eleanor, just as he is hers. Also that, despite the at least a dozen apparent power shifts in the course of the movie, at the end, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING has changed. And you can tell that with this bunch, nothing ever will change unless it's due to factors out of their control, like death.A matter of slight historical correction to other user comments Alys was legally betrothed to Richard; that's why she'd been raised by Eleanor. A historical correction to the script is that John, while thoroughly detestable personally, was not at all stupid, sniveling, or whining; his actual character was actually far closer to that of Geoffrey's in the script. Very little is actually known about the historical Geoffrey except that he was actually, if anything, more of a warrior than Richard, and of course, he died quite young, leaving behind two children, the son being the legal heir to Richard, and who died at the age of twelve or so, ostensibly of disease, possibly in reality of John. This wasn't considered that bad a thing, btw, as no one wanted a child as king, and John was the only one of the whole bunch who'd spent most of his life in England itself. The English nobles had seriously resented both Henry's (in his later years especially, as he tried to carve an inheritance for John out of Europe in general, France in particular) and Richard's neglect (Richard had barely set foot in England in his entire life, and was utterly indifferent to it except as a source of revenue). Also, of course, there's no historical evidence for an affair between Henry and Alys EXCEPT that I've read at least one source suggesting that Richard used this as an excuse to not go through with the marriage itself. And there's CERTAINLY no historical suggestion that Richard and Philip had an affair, although it seems highly likely that Richard was gay insofar as he was sexual at all. Bastards of royalty were a dime a dozen in those days, but NONE are attributed to Richard, nor a whiff or rumor of any affairs he ever had. Both Henry and John, on the other hand, would chase anything wearing a dress, and this was considered perfectly normal and even admirable in a bad boy sort of way. However, John took it too far, resorting to rape and starvation of wives of political enemies, and this was one of numerous driving forces for the imposition of Magna Carta on him by his rebelling nobles. Ironically, by contemporary standards, at a national level John was a far better king than Richard (Henry at his best was better, but was too often not at his best, being too bent on conquest to bother to rule effectively what he already had). However, John was nonetheless personally a rather nasty man (to put it mildly), once again proving that the best men don't necessarily make the best rulers. His personal character and actions, more than his policies, drove his own nobles into nearly successful rebellion, resulting in Magna Carta, one of the great steps in English history.Sorry for boring you silly with the history commentary - it's a period I've always found particularly interesting. You can wake up now; I'm finished.Anyway, great movie in every sense - script, acting, score, cinematography, editing; it just doesn't get better than this.

It combines drama, tragedy, razor-sharp comedy, great performances, and the best dialogue that has ever been spoken on film, period.I found this movie quite by accident--I was a sixteen-year-old with a Katharine Hepburn fixation. She mesmerized me; I wanted to BE her--smart, beautiful, sexy, and unwilling and unable to take anything off of anybody (except for Spencer Tracy, but that's another story). Honestly, I had no idea that there really had been such a person as Eleanor until I saw this movie. After watching my heroine portray her, I was determined to find out, though...so I have Katharine Hepburn to thank for my discovery of a new personal hero, and for my passion for medieval history.It is true that this movie is not 100% factually accurate, not only because movie making dictates tinkering with history to create an interesting film, but also because, unfortunately, not too much is known about Eleanor herself. In the middle ages, women, even powerful, intriguing women like Eleanor, were not considered important enough to merit full biographical treatment. Most of Eleanor's history is recorded in the context of her sons and husbands. A good deal of this history was written by her detractors--people who disliked or disapproved of her for one reason or another. The simple explanation is that they felt that as a woman, she overstepped the bounds of what was considered acceptable behavior for a woman of the period.That being said, this movie is 100% spiritually accurate. It perfectly captures the intrigue, the complexity of emotions and relationships, and tone of the age and the situation at hand. Though the sharp and witty dialogue is often considered a historical anachronism, this is not strictly true. Contrary to popular belief, people WERE educated in the middle ages, even women, if they were fortunate enough to be brought up in noble households, as Eleanor was. She was a brilliant woman, raised in a household where poetry and intelligent conversation were staples (her grandfather, after all, was one of the first troubadours). Henry was an intellectual powerhouse as well--he was a voracious reader who was often caught reading in church instead of paying attention to the sermons! It is unthinkable that these two minds would have produced stupid children, and the notion that the entire family should have only spoken in grunts and simple phrases is equally ludicrous.Though not historically accurate, as other reviewers have noted, the strength of this movie lies in it's perfect portrayal of some of the most fascinating and complex personalities in recorded history. Henry, Eleanor, Richard, et al., make today's political and royal figures seem like low-rent bumbling hucksters.

The storytelling is so simple yet so powerful and the acting is of such a high order that it seems timeless despite being a Historical Drama set in the 12th century.Set on the course of one night, King Henry II (Peter O'Toole) has a family reunion to see who of his three sons will be his successor to the throne, although he has his eyes set on John (Nigel Terry), but his imprisoned wife, Queen Eleanor of Acquitaine (played to perfection by Katharine Hepburn) has other plans which involve her own favorite, Richard (Anthony Hopkins in his film debut). Matters get complicated when neglected son Geoffrey (John Castle) pretends to be on John's side to serve his own interests and when Eleanor encounters Henry's mistress Alais (Jane Merrow) and will not cede the Acquitaine to Henry. Into the mix is a revelation from newly appointed King Philip of France (Timothy Dalton) in which he states that Richard had raped him (when in fact they had had an affair). Floating above the overlapping intrigues is Henry, not quite able to decide just what will the course of action to take, and when he learns that his sons have been conspiring to overthrow him (thanks to Eleanor), he almost gets painted into a corner and makes an impossible decision.This is a fascinating story, written so eloquently and performed so powerfully on-screen that one forgets this was originally a stage play with Robert Preston and Rosemary Harris in the leads. No sumptuous decorations; this, while being a family of noble extraction, they live devoid of the commodities that one would imagine coming from them. Of course, chemistry just overflows whenever Hepburn and O'Toole are together on-screen; it makes one think of the best matches in cinema history and is a shame they never worked together again as she was fond of him. If anything, they alone are the movie and never for a moment does one get bored even though the only action sequence is a scene where O'Toole drags Merrow to force her to marry Hopkins while Hepburn quietly monitors them. A beautiful film, timeless in its theme of family and inheritances, with shrewd performances, the best movie for 1968.

I love this film.  I am not sure that I can say that phrase enough when describing this movie.  Lion in Winter is quite simply one of the strangest and most beautiful movies that I have ever seen.  It is some wierd amalgam of a 'home for the hollidays' type family drama, and Machiavellian political intrigue.The essential plot is that it is 1183 and Henry II must declare his successor to the Plantagenet throne.  He invites his wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine (played by Katherine Hepburn), who is in exile, and his sons to along with king of France, to Christmas dinner.  Over the course of the evening truths are told and arguments are had, the film rolls over all of the conventions of the many genres that it plays with and turns them into something new and beautiful.The film could have been written by Machiavelli himself, and often smacks of the Mandragola.  The film demonstrates family disfunction within a very interesting, medieval paradigm.  While the film is about issues such as family, loyalty and love, ultimately is most gratifying as a vehicle for O'Toole and Hepburn to chew the scenery and dig into a few truly juicy roles.It is fantastic film that any lover of dialogue driven drama-comedy should rent and watch over and over again.

They ignore a powerhouse performance by Peter O'Toole and trounce Anthony Harvey's inspiring direction! But the final indignity was in giving the best picture award to an over-praised, undeserving, insignificant musical called OLIVER! If they had a least half a brain in their heads they could've given to FUNNY GIRL but they only shoot themselves in the foot when the deserving go unrecognized. It only goes to show the Academy's just jealous. The script and Kate's performance at least were given the royal treatment but it still leaves bitter resentment when Cliff Roberston, one of Hollywood's most less-than-adequate actors cops the best actor away from O'Toole... possibly Hollywood's most underrated, not to mention unrecognized actors of the highest caliber. Hepburn's Eleanor of Aquitaine had witty lines, quiet but still present anger and fire underneath the surface but O'Toole as Henry II gave the more powerful performance... an aesthetic that echoed Taylor and Burton for WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? only Taylor was the gutsy performer and Burton doled out the cut-lows and the intellect. To coin a phrase from the British... he (O'Toole) was bloody robbed!The story is set in Britain, 1183. Henry II is on the throne and has ten years earlier imprisoned his wife Eleanor of Acquitaine after co-conspirating a civil war against him. She and their three sons (Richard, the eldest, a brave warrior on the battlefield, whom Eleanor wants to succeed Henry as king; Geoffrey, the quietly vicious, unappreciated middle son of whom neither of them love with a plot for every occurrence and John, the piggish, dirty, thieving brat is their youngest whom Henry for some unknown reason wants on the throne) are all requested to appear at their palace of Chinon for the Christmas holidays. Also invited is young King Philip II of France whose elder sister Alais is the treasured and much-loved mistress to Henry. Philip wishes to have Alais mearried off to one of Henry's sons (preferably Richard) in order to form an alliance between England and France made between Henry and Philip's father, the late King Louis. But meanwhile, Philip is also plotting with all three boys and Eleanor to tear Henry's kingdom apart. Eleanor is merely in on it to get back at Henry for loving Alais (whom she had raised as a surrogate daughter) and the late Rosmund, an old rival of Eleanor's whom Henry replaced her with.This film has it all infidelity, betrayal, family dysfunction and a script that crackles with venom, wit and plot-twisting motivation. See it if only for O'Toole and Hepburn's first-rate performances.

When I first introduced the films plot to my student, I was met with apathy and predisposed boredom, but they quickly were caught up in the intrigue and plot twists. At each major turn (an impromptu wedding, a surprise revelation about one of the character's sexuality, etc.), the students were often literally gasping.As for the film itself, I can not think of a movie with more solid acting from the headliners (O'Toole and Hepburn) to the other principal players (Hopkins, Dalton, Terry, and especially Castle), and even the other characters are well cast (Merrow as Alais is not especially solid, but she is at least adequate in her portrayal as the only pawn in this game of kings, queens, and knights). It is, of course, not to be seen as wholly accurate historically, as it would be near impossible to achieve such for events that took place 800 years ago, but the major themes are true to form, and the film is wonderfully engrossing.

Her role is sort of an interesting counterbalance to Peter O'Toole, as King Henry II. That is, she's elderly and he's young. Maybe it was an allusion to the growing generation gap in the world at the time.But anyway, this is what epic tales of royalty are supposed to be. It shows Henry's conflicts in wondering who will succeed him. Never dragging, the movie truly gives one the feeling of being with these people and understanding their lives. One of the most interesting scenes - in my opinion at least - is when Eleanor says something about sex. I usually wouldn't expect someone of Katharine Hepburn's generation mention sex in a movie. But she does a great job here (well duh). Also starring are a very young Anthony Hopkins and an even younger Timothy Dalton. All in all, The Lion in Winter is a perfect movie in every way, and affirmed 1968 as one of the best movie years ever, with 2001 A Space Odyssey, Funny Girl, The Odd Couple, The Planet of the Apes, Romeo and Juliet, Candy, The Night of the Living Dead and Bullitt.

Further proof, that artistry is in the eye of the beholder. Ironically, years later, Hepburn, according to biographer Scott Berg, would criticize Meryl Streep for being too mannered. Of course, neither are the worse for the wear. Hepburn actually emerges triumphant in her portrayal of Eleonor of Acquitane and not least of which because we know the woman behind the artist; and know her to be a royal survivor in her own right.Other criticism that has dogged this work is that James Goldman's dark satire is muddied by the layer of emotion and even sentiment that the movie develops. But as with the film version of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, the enhanced emotional core of the story is a strong plus. To this end John Barry's forceful score lends great credibility as does Anthony Harvey's non stop strategic direction. Casting this powerful, writing this intelligent in the hands of a smart director makes this Lion unsurpassable to a stage production and certainly the unfortunate recent remake.

Charleton Heston was Andrew Jackson in THE PRESIDENT'S LADY and THE BUCCANNEER (1958). Edward Arnold was Diamond Jim Brady in DIAMOND JIM and LILIAN RUSSELL. Reginald Owen was Louis XV in VOLTAIRE and MONSIEUR BEAUCAIRE. Raymond Massey was John Brown in SANTA FE TRAIL and SEVEN ANGRY MEN. But only Peter O'Toole played the same historical figure in two major productions that were made only four years apart, and that showed the character seriously aging.O'Toole had played King Henry II of England in BECKET (1964) as a young, vibrant monarch who makes the serious mistake of appointing his best friend to the one post that will make them enemies. The period that BECKET encompasses was roughly 1165 to 1171 (when Henry allowed himself to be whipped for the murder of Becket the year before - apparently at his orders). In THE LION IN WINTER (1968) he was King Henry some twelve years later. Henry is now the most powerful monarch in Western Europe, but he has problems of dynastic and political natures.His power structure in 1183 is dependent on his hold of the marriage dower of his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine. In BECKET, Pamela Brown played Eleanor as a sharp tongued and jealous woman who arranged the murder of her rival Gwendolen (Sian Phillips), on the night Henry was going to have sex with her. Henry (who hates the sight of blood) has a nervous collapse upon seeing the results of Eleanor's activities. In THE LION IN WINTER Eleanor was played by Katherine Hepburn. Now older, she is still a match in terms of political abilities to her husband. He has let her out of her castle prison to visit him and their three surviving sons (Richard, Geoffrey, and John) as well as Princess Alais of France and her brother King Phiip Augustus of France.Henry's family get-together is not for holiday reasons (although it is occurring at Christmas). He has taken a dower from King Philip's father King Louis for Pincess Alais (Jane Merrow) to marry his oldest son Richard (Anthony Hopkins). But Alais has become the mistress of the monarch, who is considering divorcing Eleanor and starting a proper family with his second wife Alais. Richard and his two brothers (John Castle and Nigel Terry) are not happy with this prospect - nor with dynastic ambitions of each other. Of the three sons, Henry favors John (Terry) over Richard, although Richard is the better fighter. The reason is that Richard is the favorite of his mother, and has been implicated in some of her attempts to stir up civil war against Henry. Geoffrey (Castle) has brains but he is untrustworthy and finds that he is constantly dismissed by both parents. And King Philip (Timothy Dalton) is furious that due to the highhanded actions of Henry his father was reduced in power in Europe, and he is forced to report to a man who is technically his vassal due to the French lands that Henry controls.THE LION IN WINTER had been a Broadway success in the middle 1960s, starring Robert Preston as Henry. The film is a successful transition, with the elderly monarch and his elderly consort tearing at each other in a kind of medieval WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF. O'Toole is wonderful as the still intelligent, vigorous, and bullying monarch he was in BECKET, except now he is facing his own mortality. Hepburn (who won her third Oscar for this film - one year after winning her second for GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER and tying this time with Barbara Streisand for FUNNY GIRL) is able to display a woman capable of any political damage be it encouraging her sons to revolt or threatening future harm to Alais and any child she and Henry may have to torturing Henry with the suggestion that she (Eleanor) slept with Henry's father before they met.Hopkins' hapless Richard is the most sympathetic of the three sons, with his humiliation when Philip maliciously reveals that Richard is a homosexual (the first time this trait was revealed in any film about Richard the Lion Hearted). Terry's John is properly pimple faced and immature on the surface, but showing when he betrays his father that two-faced ability that would lead to his disasters as King. Castle is properly sinister throughout - one realizes that both parents will not suggest him as heir because he'd kill them as soon as he could safely plan it out afterward. Dalton's Philip is galling to O'Toole, as he keeps showing that unlike his father he knows how to harm the British monarchy - by disgracing it's leading hero (Richard), and by simply waiting for time to take it's toll on his enemy Henry. And Merrow is the most sympathetic figure in the film, genuinely loving Henry but finding even he regards her as a dynastic pawn in the end. The movie was that rarity, a sequel as thoughtful and intelligent as the first film had been, and filling in the results of that first film's background and story very well indeed.

He showed more of the pure self possessed confidence and power. But Close and the other actors were not nearly as memorable as this cast, with the possible exception of unknown Soma Marko's completely vile moron John (he really shows us why he became the villain of the Robin Hood legends.) This 1968 cast included a brilliant young Anthony Hopkins as the deeply troubled Richard and a delightfully slimy Timothy Dalton as King Phillip of France.But these are mere bit players opposite two of the greatest characters of their time. The second Welsh Plantagenet took one of the most beautiful, powerful and intellectual women of all from the King of France, (and some say his own father) It was one of the greatest love stories of all time between the two most dynamic individuals of their era. And this is what it's all about and what makes this play and this movie work. Each was really the only one the other could ever really love. Nobody else in their time even came close. And only a Hepburn could pull off Elenore of Aquitaine. I still like Stewart's Henry better because he gave me more of the Henry we know from History as a completely fearless dynamic powerful King who could do and haveanything he wanted. Even though her youthful beauty had faded, Elenore as always the great love and the only woman who could ever have been his equal. So despite all the scheming, infidelity and dysfunctional family betrayal, those two will always be one of the great matches of history right next to Caesar and Cleopatra. That's what this play is all about and why this cast's rendition will aways remain a classic.

His wife, the legendary Eleanor of Aquitaine, some years older, has led more than one civil war against him, more than once with one or other of their four sons. By 1183, Eleanor has been dungeoned up in Salisbury keep for ten years and their eldest son has died. At Christmas, Henry summons his wife and their three remaining sons - Richard, Geoffrey and John - to Chinon castle in central France. Along for the ride are Henry's mistress, the beautiful Alais, and her brother Phillip, the king of France.Henry and Eleanor are played by Peter O'Toole and Katherine Hepburn with tour-de-force acting that is second to none. They are ably supported by Anthony Hopkins, Timothy Dalton, John Castle, Jane Merrow and Nigel Terry.The purpose of the gathering is to decide who will inherit the crown and which son gets which wife and what territory as a consolation. They bicker, backbite, squabble, carp, plot, coerce, cajole, bribe and threaten in equal measures. Who will be king? Who will marry Alais and get her brother as an ally? Who will get the Aquitaine? A witty, rich and biting script and inspired characterisations by the two ferocious leads in a tale set in a vast medieval castle make this unmissable. O'Toole and Hepburn scrap and hiss and spit like alley cats whilst their sons and the French onlookers manouevere and circle cautiously around them, waiting to strike at the first hint of weakness.But there are no weaknesses here. Not in the acting, which earned Hepburn an Oscar. Not in the script, which earned James Goldman an Oscar. Not in the soundtrack, which earned a third Oscar for John Barry. The film itself and O'Toole were also nominated. The Lion in Winter has been called a twelfth century soap opera, a Dallas of the medieval era. But this is wide of the mark. It is difficult imagining J R Ewing condemning his own sons with the eloquence of Henry II I, Henry, by grace of God, king of the English, lord of Scotland, Ireland and Wales, count of Anjou, Brittany, Poitou and Normandy, Maine, Gascony and Aquitaine, do sentence you to death. Done, this Christmas Day, at Chinon, in God's year eleven eighty three.This is a classic film, essential to anybody interested in acting or writing or wanting a glimpse into the world of twelfth century politicking. Don't miss it. Trivia notes. Richard, played here by Hopkins in his film debut, became King Richard the Lionheart (not the Lionhearted) whom Robin Hood supposedly supported. John became King John of the same tales; and in reality was the King John who signed the Magna Carta in the early thirteenth century. Nigel Terry, who played John, went on to play King Arthur in Excalibur some years later. Henry II was the great-grandfather of Edward I, William Wallace's nemesis in Braveheart.

Henry II is still in mourning for the death of his eldest son who would have been Henry III. He's not quite sure what to do about the succession. He's inviting his three surviving sons, Richard, Geoffrey and John and their mother, the legendary Eleanor of Aquitaine.The nice thing about The Lion in Winter is that you don't need a knowledge of English history to help you follow the plot. It certainly helps, but the skill of the players and the great direction they get from Anthony Harvey makes this film understandable and universal.Peter O'Toole is not crazy about all three of his sons. He's an older and wiser man than the young monarch we saw him play in Becket. He sees the weaknesses in all of them. Richard who is a pure warrior, more interested in battles and killing than ruling, Geoffrey who schemes with every breath, and John who's an amiable dunce of kid, manipulated by everyone. None inspire any confidence.And then there's Eleanor a tough minded woman, liberated centuries before Germaine Greer, and played in a grand manner by Katharine Hepburn. Her dissolution of her marriage to Louis VII of France and her marriage with Henry II brought the large and rich Aquitaine province into the British auspices. She plays both the province and her sons in a never ending battle of wits with her husband as ruthlessly as any riverboat gambler.Two pieces of historical fact must be noted. The realm of Henry II consisted of England and a great deal of northern France. Rule in his realm meant of a necessity that the king divide his time in both parts of his far flung empire. That's why the gathering is in Chinon in France which was under English rule.The second fact is that the English king was also Duke of Normandy at that time and in that title owed allegiance to his sovereign the King of France who is played here by Timothy Dalton. But he's also a powerful monarch in his own right. The duality of those titles is a great deal of the reason for the conflict you see between Dalton and the entire Plantagenet family.And Dalton plays the whole lot of them off against each other. As King Philip II Augustus, he is as important in French history as Henry II is in British. He's the son of the man that Henry stole Eleanor from by another queen and that fact is upper most in his mind.There's no real story in The Lion in Winter. It's like a medieval Long Day's Journey into Night, a glimpse into the inner workings of a royal family. Long and deep on characterization as is the O'Neill classic. Still you'll be both entertained and informed watching it. Author James Goldman did his research well.The sons are played by John Castle as Geoffrey, Nigel Terry, as John and Anthony Hopkins in the first film that brought him notice as Richard, later on Richard the Lion Hearted. This is a far more realistic Richard than had ever been shown before including his well known homosexuality.The Lion in Winter won Katharine Hepburn her third Best Actress Award though she shared it with Barbra Streisand for Funny Girl. Peter O'Toole got his third nomination of eight for Best Actor losing to Cliff Robertson for Charly. That's one I've never understood. It's a great ensemble cast, everyone at his very best and not to be missed when broadcast.

Lion in Winter is one of my favorite movies of all time!! Katherine Hepburn won for best actress in 1968 with this role!! Peter O'Toole who played Henry II, and Anthony Hopkins, who played Richard, are two of the finest actors in the history of the silver screen!! The year was 1183 A.D. a time of the barbarians, which meant it was an environment consisting of a potpourri of megalomania, dictatorial entitlement, and the visceral components of primary survival!! Everybody loathed everybody else!! A provision for heartfelt emotions was obviated by an enmity which focused on the ruthless gratification of the boorish hierarchy!! The passion for hatred was relentless in this movie!! In evaluating the plot keywords of this film, they were summed up as the battle of the sexes, and a dysfunctional marriage!! Suffice it to say, these were masterpieces of understatement!! A wife was reduced to the post of insensate chattel, and thus, she was relegated to the hedonistic wishes of the king, until, it was seemingly appropriate for the king to inflict his wife with dotage by decree!! Henry II's time was one where the only philosophical reality in people's lives was death. The line of logic being that if you bore them, you had the right to execute them as well... This blatant disregard for human life cultivated an abject misery for the precarious plights of everyone involved in the subjugation of the capricious royalty!! I found this film to be spectacular, as a writer, I can appreciate the monotonously challenging approach Lion in Winter took to articulating realism!! The dialog compounds the deplorable rancor to the prevailing circumstances during the barbarian era of HenryII!! This film is a somber depiction of ancient history, and history is history for better or worse!! No!! I do not have any perception of what it was like in England in the year 1183, however, the rudimentary despondence which was depicted in this movie is sufficient enough to purvey a frightful conception of a terrorizing, primate, and sub-humanoid callousness!! I would not have wanted to live during that era of uncivilized human history!! Believe Me!! Movies like Lion in Winter take on artistically dimensional endeavors that elevate the standards in theatrical and cinematic entertainment, thus, they should be rewarded for it!! FABULOUS FILM!!!FIVE STARS!!! A PERFECT TEN!!!

Hepburn's performance is marvelous. A Connecticut Yankee in King Henry's court, she nevertheless takes total possession of the role. Watching Anthony Harvey direct Hepburn and her six fellow thespians through James Goldman's script is what makes the otherwise tiresome, overdone subject matter come alive. The Lion in Winter cast is formidable, with O'Toole and Dalton (his first appearance) making kingly impressions. The music, by John Barry, is another obvious strength.

On Broadway, the roles of Henry and Eleanor were played by Robert Preston and Rosemary Harris. The casting director for the Broadway production commented that the original auditions, before Preston and Harris injected the spice and humor into the dialogue, were heavy going, the delivery of the actors very, very serious. Imagine this movie with no spark, no sarcasm, no wry humor injected into the lines, and you've got yourself a real nightmare.Fortunately, it's not the case. Though the story takes dramatic license with the truth - for instance, there was no Christmas gathering of the actual family in 1183, but there was in 1182 - the depiction of the family's infighting, considering how everything turned out, is probably quite correct. King Henry II wants to name his successor and brings his family together. This includes his imprisoned wife, Eleanor of Quitaine (Hepburn), his mistress, Princess Alais (Merrow), and his three sons - Richard (Hopkins), Geoffrey (Castle) and John (Terry), and Alais' brother, King Philip of France (Dalton). Everybody makes deals they don't intend to make good, promises they don't plan to keep, and alliances they don't want in order to secure the throne either, in the sons' cases, for themselves, or in Eleanor and Henry's cases, for someone else.To say that Henry and Eleanor have a volatile relationship is a tremendous understatement, and the dialogue is an incredible roller-coaster ride that's never boring. One wonders if an audience would sit through such a film today. If not, it's a pity, because it's so brilliant. Watching O'Toole and Hepburn sparring - sometimes so cruelly and bitterly that it's devastating - is addictive. You can't turn away from it. Hepburn shows us immediately by subtle actions - a quick expression that's just as quickly covered up, a slight hesitation in movement or speech - that no matter what her words say, she worships Henry still. For Henry, she is the most challenging and exciting woman he has ever known - and because of the volatility of their relationship, they can't survive together. Talk about being able to push each other's buttons - with Henry, it's whether or not Eleanor slept with his father; with Eleanor, it's his desire to marry Alais and divorce her.O'Toole takes the title of the film literally, and he indeed roars like an old lion. A powerful and overt actor, Henry II, which he played twice, is one of his greatest roles and this performance perhaps his best. Handsome, sexy, angry and wild, he holds the screen magnificently. For me this is Hepburn's best role. Her Eleanor is beautiful, dignified, sensitive and determined, easily wounded by Henry, though she tries not to show it.Henry II lived another 6 years, during which time Eleanor remained imprisoned by him, although she enjoyed more freedom and actually occasionally traveled with Henry. Henry was succeeded by Richard and then, because Richard had no heirs, by John. Eleanor spent her last years as a nun and, no surprise, outlived all of her children except for King John and Queen Leonora. Both Henry and Eleanor will live forever in The Lion in Winter. Imagine a movie with such superstars that Anthony Hopkins has a supporting role - thus was the case in 1968 when the young Hopkins played Richard, a closet homosexual who has had an affair with Philip of France. (Oh, Richard, Eleanor says as she sends him to make a deal with Philip, promise him ANYTHING.) History is quite divided over whether or not Richard was actually gay, but some writings definitely indicate that he was. Hopkins is brilliant as a tough and even cruel man who has a very sensitive side that can be gotten to by his mother. The rest of the acting is uniformly excellent.One of the greatest scripts with one of the greatest casts of all time "},{"Title":"Extraordinary battle of wits and verbal warfare  between O'Toole and Hepburn","Date":"22 January 2008","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, History","Review":" This excellent costume drama with box office success is set in Christmas 1183.

The royal palace at Chinon in France, then under English rule. Henry II is pondering his choice of successor to the throne; at fifty, he is older than most men he knows and he senses time passing too quickly.The death of Henry's eldest son and namesake has left the throne up for grabs between his three remaining sons Richard, the great warrior later to be known as Lion-Heart; Geoffrey, cold, methodical, and deeply resentful of his place in the middle of the pack, but more than smart enough to make the most of any advantage that should arise; and John, clumsy and appearing half-witted at times despite the fact that as he says, he speaks several languages and has studied law.Eleanor wants the throne for Richard, her favorite. Henry resents Eleanor's affection for Richard and has settled on John primarily because he is all there is; neither parent seems to trust the conniving and sneaky Geoffrey which sort of puts him out of the running. Maybe.Also at the scene is Alais, the French princess betrothed to Richard but at the moment sharing Henry's bed, and her brother, the young Phillip II of France.Unlike most historical dramas, this one is not picture-pretty and filled with classical actors declaiming flowery speeches; these people hiss, growl, bellow, and curse at each other shamelessly, all the while pursuing their own agendas.The whole cast is brilliant, but O'Toole and Hepburn are positively mesmerizing. O'Toole, playing fifty at age thirty-six, and Hepburn, twenty-five years his senior (the age gap between the characters is somewhat narrower) but every inch his match, engage in a no-holds-barred, all-out free-for-all in which no punches are pulled and no words are left unsaid. This is possibly the most dysfunctional family ever put on film, but for all the rancor and conflict, they still act like a family in the film's handful of quiet moments.This is one of those movies that has to be experienced. It is also the sort of film that rewards multiple viewings.A first-class job. And while I loved the musical OLIVER!, I really think TLIW should have won Best picture.

Nominally based on the fight over Henry II's throne (although the film does naturally play around with the facts), the film introduces all of it's main characters and then wastes no time before letting the deception and wordplay begin. What makes the film special is the tone and manner in which the characters converse with one another. Unlike many other costume dramas, THE LION IN WINTER remembers that people of the 1100s probably weren't all that different from people today - and that they fight, ridicule, and swipe delicious barbs at each other just like we do in contemporary times.In hopes of really sealing the LAWRENCE OF ARABIA connection even further, we have Peter O'Toole in a sly and broad performance as Henry II, and while is certainly not subtle, he also never descends into ham-handedness either. Anthony Hopkins, John Castle, and Nigel Terry are memorable as Henry's three sons, as are Jane Merrow and a young Timothy Dalton as Henry's mistress and her brother - all of whom claim they have a right to some portion the throne. What really knocks the film up a notch into being a great film, however, is the fantastic, Oscar-winning performance of Katharine Hepburn as Queen Eleanor. Full of vigor and unapologetically mean-spirited, Hepburn's Eleanor is more than a match for O'Toole's pompous King, and the dissolution of marriage has seldom been more entertaining than it is when these two go head to head in battle.

In 1183 King Henry II's oldest son dies, and now the crown is up for grabs between his three remaining sons. A Christmas court is held to decide the successor. Henry summons his wife, Queen Elanor (who's been languishing in prison for several years), his sons, and the young King of France. Let the games begin!.The plot does not move in a straight line. Throughout the movie the characters plot, counterplot, make phony alliances, and emotionally manipulate one another in an effort to gain better footing at the expense of someone else. And through it all King Henry (who is holding all the cards) takes sadistic joy in dangling carrots in front of them and gleefully jerking them away.

This movie is rich with a lot of ideas and concepts, and yet it mostly comes down to the acting - people not exactly of the small-time variety like Peter O'Toole and Katharine Hepburn as the King of England and Eleanor of Aquataine (in other words, the Queen, or once was), and featuring supporting roles for the likes of Anthony Hopkins (his first film, really) and Timothy Dalton. Does a lot of this get stagy? Oh, very much so. It can be a drawback, or maybe just the Showiness in quotation marks. I use quotes since that's what other people say, and I do too. But is this necessarily a bad thing? No, but the feeling that this was a play and brought to the screen by its author is never left.This is all essentially a familial drama with political implications at a lot of turns the King has to choose his heir, as he is fifty years old and seemingly won't live that much longer (perhaps for the time, the 12th century, it was quite old, albeit Eleanor is supposed to be 61). Who will he choose super strong but emotionally wounded Richard, the middle-child with his own scheming Phillip, or the lovable but weak-willed and odd John? If he really could have his way he'd want to choose all of them - and, as one might see, the question could arise that none of them is an option - but a lot of these games are complicated by other factors, such as of course Eleanor, the mother of his children and a prisoner for her own scheming over the years; the King of France (Dalton) who is often referred to as boy, and the king's sister cum mistress for Henry, and a to-be-betrothed to one of the sons (Jane Merrow, underrated among the cast, she's really good here).In other words, there's some wackiness that ensues, of the sometimes dark, melodramatic and brooding kind. But what I found most interesting were what was behind so much of the drama, what these characters carry with them and continue to do so, some of them as they are facing death sooner someday than others. With Eleanor of Aquataine, this is a character who has had power taken away from her, she really doesn't have anything, and yet she can - or really has to - cut Henry down every chance she can to keep up to his level. She really is a vulnerable character deep down, when she can show it, though when that is exactly is anyone's guess. Like many plays (or the ones that I've seen and heard over the years), the games that people play on each other - think Virginia Woolf, for instance - is what is supposed to make it riveting for the audience. Who is going to plot what next? How will all of this drama (verging on soap opera) unfold? Maybe all of this is soap opera. There were certainly times, like when the sons are hiding not totally comically in Dalton's bedchamber when Henry comes in to have a talk, that the staginess of it can't be helped. But what stuck out for me and what made me like the movie so much is that the director Anthony Harvey and writer Goldman takes this material as seriously as they can, and mostly as this family drama first. Again, one may think of Game of Thrones as well (this could just as easily be the Lannister clan, fans of the show will know what I mean). And yet in order for this stuff to work, the actors do have to sell it and not hold back; if one is to do this sort of high-voltage, highly emotionally charged stuff right, get some people who will commit to it completely.Peter O'Toole gives what could be one of his two or three best performances here. That's a bold statement considering what other work he did in his career, but really when has he been better? Yes, this King has to yell and pontificate in GRAND, BIG ways (in caps) in many scenes. But a lot of this, we are in the know on, is braggadocio, like a much more refined version of Archie Bunker or Ralph Kramden. And yes, a sitcom comparison could be made here, only the laughs had aren't shallow or base these characters really can't stand one another - that, and, in one of those contradictions people have to keep in their heads one alongside the other, they love each other still. That's what's fascinating about watching O'Toole and Hepburn (in a role far more Oscar-y than 'Dinner' in 67). If you don't buy them as a bitter, wry, deeply wounded married couple, the movie actually doesn't work as well. I bought into them, and many of their scenes carry that electrified air of big, bold dramatic moments, especially in the last act when big claims are made about past familial ties.I don't know if it's all a great film. Some of the dramatic confrontations here get into that realm of such theatricality that it's hard to take a few times, just in that way of 'Oh, for chrissake, just kill each other and get it over with already!' But it has such a strong script and acting, and the themes of being a woman in that period and what a marriage was in such medieval times, or being a father and sons, that I had a great time watching it.

The Plantagenets are one of the premiere dysfunctional families of history, long on craftiness and many of them quite short on common sense.Katharine Hepburn won her third of four Oscars for her performance as the diabolical queen who hates one of her sons while doting on the other two. To watch Hepburn go toe-to-toe with the much younger Peter O'Toole as King Richard is like an acting master class, and throwing in future legend Anthony Hopkins and future James Bond Timothy Dalton as well. Others include Jane Merrow a gentle Alias (in spite of the verbal speer she tosses at John, quite frankly he deserves it) and Nigel Terry as the sulking John who one day would be King, albeit one so hated that no English King has taken on that name ever since.Following this brilliant adaption of the Broadway play, British nobility would become frequent movie fare, with Anne of the Thousand Days and Mary Queen of Scotts immediately following, and views of Young Winston and The Nelson Affair showing other sides of British politics with scandal thrown in. O'Toole was robbed of the Oscar, his performance so powerful that it simply wreaks Academy Award, while Hepburn had to share hers with a certain Funny Girl. Then, there's that fantastic musical score by John Barry, so unforgettable with its Gothic flair and almost a demonic sound as if announcing the arrival of Satan himself. I'd hang them from the nipples, but it would shock the children, Hepburn wryly notes after picking up a huge necklace, and her characterization also brings up memories of that line, here paraphrased from Mildred Pierce, where Eve Arden states, She has me convinced that alligators have the right idea. They eat their young. Hepburn's Eleanor certainly may not have eaten her young literally, but she certainly does so metaphorically, and for just under 2 1/2 hours, you will have a ball watching her do so, spewing them out onto her stunned husband.

And wit? The dialog absolutely crackles with wit - and you find yourself challenged to keep up with the zingers whipped off with great aplomb by these towering talents. (I first saw this as an elementary school student, on a field trip believe it or not - and I was so impressed by James Goldman's screenplay I had to go to the bookstore and buy it (it was released in book form); it was one of the few movies whose screenplays I absolutely had to have.) You don't have to be a fan of Katharine Hepburn or Peter O'Toole, either, to marvel at their incredible performances in this film. Whew! The sparks really fly - and a young Anthony Hopkins and Timothy Dalton (who later played James Bond briefly) help make that happen (if you didn't realize what a fine actor Dalton is, you have to see this film; Hopkins doesn't disappoint, either - as does he ever). The chemistry between everyone in this cast is about as natural and perfect as it could be, too. This is one of those films you'll later find yourself quoting - especially one very memorable line spoken by Hepburn (which you'll recognize when you hear it), which even manages to bring out a sense of humor in the middle of incredibly intense events. Memorable, great - even the music is (what an awesome score by John Barry - I had to buy the album after seeing the film, too!).

She was able to have their marriage annulled thru the claim of consanguinity ... the discovery that they were too close as blood relatives for a legal marriage.Six weeks later she married Henry of England, who was a marginally closer blood relative than her first husband.Eleanor, thru various coincidences, had as a female come to the leadership position of Aquitane, the most wealthy region of France, and as a result she nominally controlled about a third of what is modern France.Two years after she married Henry, he ascended to the Throne of England as Henry II. I believe that Eleanor figured she would not have long to wait to be queen.She bore Henry II eight children, including five sons.The eldest, another Henry, eventually embarked on a revolt against his father. Eleanor supported his revolt, which never really got close to succeeding. Henry the son eventually contracted dysentery in a war camp and died. For the crime of supporting the revolt, Henry II kept Eleanor locked away where she could do no political harm for 16 years.You'll hear reference to just about all of the above during the course of this delightful stage play adapted to the screen. Tho probably too 'dull' for younger ears nowadays, this script is intelligent, witty, and encapsulates the resulting politics over the future of the throne into an entertaining nutshell.Not only does it include an Oscar winning performance by Kate Hepburn, but Peter O'Toole vigorously gives us a good look at Henry II, who WAS vigorous. He expired at about the age of 56 as a result of injuries sustained during a jousting match! Early looks at Anthony Hopkins and Timonthy Dalton are quite interesting. Although Hopkins is instantly recognizable, the young and slim Dalton takes a bit to discover if you didn't already know he was in the film. His voice is quite recognizable, but he has yet to grow into the man who will play James Bond.So you action and sex junkies can look elsewhere ... this film is not for you.

So, here we go again....EVERYONE is right when they praise this movie and the fantastic acting by O'Toole, Hepburn, Hopkins, Castle, Terry, Merron; the direction was awesome, the score very riveting (which drew me to the film in the first place); lighting sensational, cinematography perfect, costuming very believable (not one of those movies where everyone parades-around in gorgeous outfits), sets extremely appropriate. I don't know how anyone could find fault with any part of it.The opening scene, King Henry II watching his youngest son jesting and learning how to become a killer (he is a monster, anyway), explains exactly the kind of man Henry has always been - a lecher if it moves, he's had sex with it. He tells his mistress (Merron) he has made love to little boys; she is his wife's adopted daughter, sister of King Philip of France (Eleanor) was married to their father, as the Queen of France, and raised them both, giving the French king no heirs). Eleanor was the rage of Europe and wherever she traveled, having owned most of France since she was a young woman; she isn't about to give it up to a king (her Engligh husband) who has been so adulterous (not to mention herself, also). If the king is so worried she will de-throne him, no wonder he has her locked-up in a prison/castle. With parents like these, how else can their children be (especially the sons) but wanting to get rid of the king so they can ascend the throne ? Almost every user who has posted a comment here writes eloquently, as the movie is written by James Goldman Anthony Harley had a masterpiece to direct, as almost every user has written. They are all right this film should have won every award for that year.They are also correct that NONE of the plot's back-stabbing has been solved at the end of the movie. Eleanor is happy to get back on her barge and sail back to her prison; she knows that Henry's threat to go to the pope to have their marriage dissolved is a sham - she's already been through that with the King of France. Henry II isn't about to give-up his mistress and all the other miscreants in his sexual life. The sons haven't been given any hope they will ascend the throne, but know that mummy is in there plotting to make it Richard (Hopkins), because he's her favorite and she KNOWS that he is homosexual and had an affair with Philip. Some users deny this - it's well-known. So, here's a set-up for the perfect sequel, rather-than making the same film over-and-over again. I suggestEleanor of Aquitane lived well into her 80s - she out-lived Henry II and all their kids, and NEVER gave-up Aquitane. She was an international power, even with the papacy, so why not tell some of the outrageous incidents of her later life? which would give some other great actress (more-so than Hepburn?) the opportunity to complete this phenomenal woman's life-story. Whomever she may be, if they don't copy Hepburn's fire-and-ice performance, they're crazy. Streep could do it very easily.The Lion in Winter is a real blockbuster - it has everything a classic film needs.......plain-ole, high-powered, brilliant acting. Who needs explosions and CGIs? If you are familiar with a little medieval history, that's to your advantage; if you ARE NOT, here's the opportunity to learn. Lion shows exactly how nasty, ambitious nobility was/is, and - in those years - didn't live in palaces like Versailles or Buckingham. It's a shame we can't rate it higher......

The opening scenes of the movie, in particular, subject the viewer to constant zooming in and out that is reminiscent of old episodes of Hawaii Five-O. On top of that, the herky-jerky editing and inconsistent color constantly remind viewers that this is a film. It is not until well into the film that the effect of these distractions seems to recede.As a filmed stage play, the film probably does as well as one can expect. Stage plays are, by nature, talky, and this one certainly is. The performances are intense, but there are some underlying gaps (noted by other reviewers) that make it difficult to fully embrace what is going on in the story -- certain actions and motivations seem arbitrary and contrived. From that perspective -- and I do not mean to make any other comparison -- a film like Sleuth is more successful, because despite the rather far-fetched premise, everything is internally consistent. Here, by contrast, it is hard to know exactly why these events are taking place, other than that the playwright has chosen to gather these characters together at this time and let them affect each other.

Richard succeeded him, but got lost in the Crusades and John then succeeded Richard, and trapped at Runnymead in 1225, was forced by the English barons to sign the Magna Carta, thus ending the absolute monarchy his father had established.

I can recall of this happening at least 5 times throughout the movie. A second aspect to the dialogue was the relationships. The brothers were all forming alliances with each other King Henry II, Eleanor of Aquitaine, and King Philip of France. At one point of the movie I had no idea who was supporting who. For example there is a scene were all three brothers are conversing with King Philip, but each time one walks in the other starts to hide. Even King Henry the II walks in and suddnely it turns into a huge argument. Even in the ending provides no resolve to the movie when suddenly Eleanor of Aquitane and King Henry II resolve their relationship. I have no idea how this movie could win an Oscar for best screenplay.Another disappointing part of the movie was the acting. The brothers other than Richard (Anthony Hopkins) seemed to be out of character and did not show enough expression. King Philip (Timothy Dalton) seemed to be over the top. But that I could with stand. The performance that disappointed me the most was Katherine Hepburn as Eleanor of Aquitaine (especially after winning an Oscar for it). She seemed to struggle with her British accent. She also was very much over the top and wasn't very convincing as a Queen. She was a serious mis-cast. The two acting performances that held this movie together was Peter O'toole as King Henry II (who probably deserved the Oscar) who probably played better than he did in Becket because he was required to and Anthony Hopkins as Richard who played vet good as the son with a true desire of becoming king. Other than these two great performances, this great story was turned into a inconclusive and enigmatic spectacle.

The all-powerful Henry II (Peter O'Toole), summons his politically ambitious family to a reunion in 1183, when a decision on succession is deemed advisable. This includes his exiled, embittered and imprisoned wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine (Katherine Hepburn), and three legitimate male offspring, along with his mistress and her brother, youthful king Philip of France. King Henry II schemes against the mother of his children, Eleanor to try to get his favorite son, a sniveling slack-jaw John (Nigel Terry), appointed as his successor while Eleanor hopes to position her favorite, the soldier genius Richard (Anthony Hopkins), as the heir apparent. Meanwhile, middle child, the reserved and quiet Geoffrey (John Castle) hopes to play them all against one another and come out victorious as the future king. The members of this tempestuous family jockey for position and brutally squabble among each other, rekindling every injury suffered and adding new, Homeric insults to their already bruised reputations.In one day, the seven characters are stripped bare of all inner torments, outward pretensions and governing personality traits. Goldman blends in his absorbing screenplay elements of love, hate, frustration, fulfillment, ambition and greed. The relationships between people, though ambivalent, are ambivalent with a certain satisfying ferocity. Director Anthony Harvey's knowledge of the craft aids him in keeping the tension high and never letting the audience settle for long on an outcome in the constant feud, with twists, turns and plenty of incredible backstabbing.Even though Terry, Castle and especially Hopkins are all at the top of their craft, this film is all about the thorny and turbulent relationship between Henry and Eleanor, whom he's had imprisoned to keep her from meddling with his empire. A marvelously flamboyant Peter O'Toole plays the revolting king to the hilt and holds his own against Katherine Hepburn in a witty, literate, and inventive script. Hepburn is simply magnificent as the scheming and shrewd Eleanor of Aquitaine. There is something about an actress with this degree of presence and a wholly distinct, pleasant and idiosyncratic voice that gets her through even misplaced weepy or extravagant scenes. Her verbal duels with the equally impressive O'Toole are spellbinding. Both play their scenes with great passion, vigor and expertise. Right from the first scene, they both show a wonderful relish for even the most mundane sarcastic line.Despite feeling a bit stage-bound, The Lion in Winter is every bit as engrossing and watchable. It's a nuanced, gorgeous film that keeps you riveted right from the word go.

Directed by Anthony Harvey with Goldman as the screenwriter, headlined by O'Toole and Hepburn, well, contrary to my expectation, it comes out as a rather enervating and mind-numbing non- starter. So it all happens during Christmas 1183, King Henry II of England (O'Toole), convenes Queen Eleanor (Hepburn), whom he has imprisoned for months in a castle, and their three sons, Richard (Hopkins), Geoffrey (Castle) and John (Terry) to Chinon, Anjou for a family reunion and to discuss the issue of heir-ship, with King Philip II of France (Dalton) as their guest, and also presented is Alais (Merrow), Henry's mistress and Philip's sister, who is betrothed to Richard. That being so, it forges a cobweb of stakes around them while all the three princes contend to be crowned the future king, Richard is championed by Eleanor and John is Henry's favourite, while Geoffrey has his own calculations.Yet all the relations cannot be simply divided by love or hate, being a sterling dramaturge, Goldman maps out an intricate love-and-hate struggle between almost any two random characters, at first, it is relishing to enjoy these top players mount their mélange of feelings through their eloquent oration and wordplay, but being a different art form from a dialogue- driven play confined in a simple locale, the film version tries to duplicate the same pathos using the same method, soon the narrative steers towards excesses, there is no time for audience to ruminate the bombard of colloquies, in the next scene, the same power struggle/psychological game repeats itself between other characters, at the end of day, after all the labouring bickering, the status quo remains unseated, from choosing the right heir, to threatening of dethroning Eleanor from the title, to the extreme of murdering all his sons for the sake of marrying Alais and they can start life anew, the script is overwhelmingly rich for its 134 minutes running time, nonetheless the final upshot proves all above is merely lip service, no exciting changeover presented, all we know is for medieval people, their mouth never match their heart, it is a rather exhausting anticlimax and doesn't sharpen the process of character building. Hardly one can blame it on the cast, all is busting their asses to construct the atmosphere of dramatic intensity, even for Hopkins, Dalton and Terry (who just passed away earlier this year at a quite young age of 69), in their screen debut. Hopkins possesses a wide-eyed earnestness which is very rare in his staple phenotypes. Dalton is fiercely wet behind the ears in front of Hepburn and O'Toole, alas their undercurrent of homosexuality only superficially touched on. Terry is deliberately grotesque, Castle preserves a distinctive but untapped inscrutability and the Golden Globe nominated Merrow cannot remotely match two top-billers' expertise. Hepburn's magnificent spirit is perpetually something to shout about, so is O'Toole's frenzied outbursts, for whom we all have a soft spot considering his ill-fated Oscar journey (8 nominations with zero win), alas, neither her nor him can hold the top spot in my book for this lines-laden period elaboration. Reckoning its higher rating elsewhere and an extolled reputation, this is another specimen where a dissonance existing between one's personal view and the accepted general opinion, being a non-radical and rational film reviewer, not so often this occurs to me, so although being slightly disappointed, personally I feel delightful to retain one's own differences once in a while.

Syphilis was not known in 1183 AD, at least by that name. Queen Eleanor's son could not have seen her pictures when she was young. The boats shown in the film are too sophisticated in engineering for 1183 AD. And there is no blood in the entire film with so many killings with swords and knives, And why did director Anthony Harvey have to show the statues with chipped noses and ears in the opening credits?

It is 1183, and King Henry II (Peter O'Toole) has assembled his wife (Katharine Hepburn) and sons at his French estate. The King hopes to appoint his youngest son successor, but his family have other plans. What unfolds is a game of stealth and strategy, our large cast of royals, each a Machiavellian monster, plotting to cross, double cross and even kill, all in the name of titles and property. Based on a play by James Goldman, this is politics as schoolyard bickering, our Kings, princes and Queens as ignoble and idiotic as crybabies and bullies.The Lion in Winter is shapeless, overly proud of its wit, and poorly structured. It is at its best when it acknowledges the comedic absurdity of its premise (What family doesn't have its ups and downs?) and when a young Timothy Dalton is on screen. He plays King Philip II, a serpentine man whose burning hatred stems from both Henry and Henry's eldest son, Richard the Lionheart (Anthony Hopkins). Both father and son are a couple of rapists, sodomizers and brutes, with Phillip being just one of their many victims.But it is Henry's imprisoned queen, Eleanor of Aquitaine (Hepburn), who's given the film's best lines. In a long monologue she explains that her family, indeed the whole feudal system, is the cause of all the hate, violence and ugliness in the world. Moment's later she looks in a mirror and praises her own beauty.7.9/10 &#x96; See Kurosawa's Ran for this material handled as good as its ever been.

When you get the chance to see them both grace the screen together, you have to take it. Both of them have very memorable scenes and give legendary performances. Unfortunately the film as a whole isn't their best, but the dialogue and performances are enough of a reason to give this film a look.They play king and queen, but in reality they are very far from being a happily married royal couple. Throw in Anthony Hopkins and Timothy Dalton, who launched their career with their roles and you get a cinema classic. Hepburn plays an emotionally unstable queen who always seems to have something new up her sleeve. Not only does she plan against King Henry, but convinces her sons to do the same. Its refreshing to see Hepburn in a role other than her earlier roles where she simply throws herself at every man. In this movie, you don't want to mess with her, she threatens with words but the look on her face just shouts power. She shares some of the most memorable scenes, in particular with Henry.But the craziest and must gut wrenching scene involves Henry, his three sons, and King Philip. The film suffers a bit by not having any fast moving scenes. The finale does deliver on the thrill of how much these people would do for power. Its quite ridiculous to think that people in this time period would put their family and closest friends in danger to secure royalty. But there are still times that the sons feel a bit comical. Anthony Hopkins is good but the other sons don't feel like real people.

The story is set in 1183 AD during King Henry II's (O'Toole) decision of dividing the throne between his three sons who'll all want to inherit it (they're played by Hopkins, John Castle and Nigel Terry). Henry's wife Elanor of Aquitaine (Hepburn, spectacular performance that gave her a third Oscar, tied with Barbra Streisand for Funny Girl) is released of her prison to spend Christmas with the family and with Henry's lover (Jane Merrow) and her brother Philip, King of France (Dalton); and all of this important figures are on a trail of deceptions, greed, villainy, tricks, back stabbings and lies, orchestrating a epical battle of quotes and conversations deciding who'll get the throne in the family.There's some many twists and turns in this Shakespearian plot and in such short time, it is so fast that is very difficult but very intriguing story where's is almost impossible to penetrate in the truth behind the lies; everybody has a card under the sleeve, bluffing all the time to see who gets fooled first. A family with no sense of love or union that uses the word love as something playful and of no importance. Even Eleanor recognizes Every family has its ups and downs but in this case they can only go down. They dared themselves to call themselves as nobles, but they already knew that they were the savages, disguised with titles, names, guns and fortune who only wanted more and more territories to conquer, wishing a eminent war to occur. Based on James Goldman's play (who also wrote the magnificent screenplay for the film), The Lion in Winter it is a wonderful surprise in so many levels that is difficult to pick one thing and say something about it but what I can say is that the great final minutes wasn't the way I thought it could be. Performances of the highest quality here, with a dominating and humored Hepburn; a powerful and angry O'Toole (how come he lost the Oscar for this role?); and the debut performances of Anthony Hopkins and Timothy Dalton (he's really good here, you almost forget his James Bond roles). Anthony Harvey directed a exciting, fascinating, well constructed film whose dialogs and acting were among the best works filmed in the 1960's.

The story of The Lion in Winter is a great one to work from, and one that works wonderfully. It is set mostly in the austere castle ramparts over the Christmas festival, yet it is also a story of a family squabble that has geopolitical import, in other words the Medieval Dymnastic War. The sets, scenery and costumes are exquisite, and John Barry's score is breathtakingly beautiful and suitably melancholic. The direction is excellent, and while the film is over 2 hours it never feels as though it's dragging.In fact thanks to primarily the script and performances it is utterly riveting. The dialogue, what can I say? Can I coin the phrase among the best ever written? The dialogue is so good, and sparkles constantly, not to mention memorable and incredibly thought-provoking. The performances especially from the two leads are brilliant. Katherine Hepburn is a revelation as the skillful and consummate Eleanor, while a deliciously robust Peter O'Toole gives one of his best performances as Henry II.

We're back in the 1100's but this ain't no stuffy costume drama. Gird yourself for an up-to-date battle royale amidst a most neurotic clan.Henry II and his imprisoned queen Eleanor are the unhappy, hyper-articulate couple -- equals, except in power, on such dimensions as intelligence, manipulative ability, and zest for life. The children they hold in wavering contempt, and associated hangers-on both in and out of court, comprise a writhing nest of scheming favorites and pawns. Watching these people joust verbally is the central joy of A Lion in Winter.

Whomever has the floor, his or her words fall with the precision of a sword. Each of the characters speaks with consummate diction, in a manner invoked by Samuel Taylor Coleridge when he defined poetry as the best words in the best order. Classic literature buffs may enjoy the several allusions to Shakespeare. For example, Henry notes that he doesn't want to repeat the Lear of legend's blunder by parsing up his kingdom. And Henry's youngest son, John -- if you're a prince, this underachiever is told, there's hope for every ape in Africa -- embodies all the foolishness we'd expect from someone who becomes central to Shakespeare's history play.I can't help but imagine that the Bard would have applauded this film.

Unfortunately, as a recent article in a major publication noted, the movie business has now been taken over by  the businessmen, who's only goal is the bottom line rather than art and the vast majority of movies are now designed to cater to the uneducated sex and violence voyeur or the teeny bopper, and are now only movies and no longer motion pictures, much less pieces of art.  So, how does one select those motion pictures of the 20th Century that are truly art.  Few movies are art, but some make it as some few artists, painters, sculptures, writers, poets and composers over the last centuries have.  Sadly, as in all the arts, eventually, a quintessential artist arises who cannot be surpassed, by example, Vincent van Gogh. One relatively safe method of selecting a motion picture as a piece of art is to look on what the motion picture is based.  Some are based on original screenplays by the leading screenwriters.  More often, a screenplay based on a book will turn out to be a credible work as art.  Most often, a screenplay based on an original stage play is a very good indicator.The other relatively safe method of finding a work of art is to look at the producers and directors David Lean, Francis Ford Coppola, George Roy Hill, Norman Jewison, Steven Speilberg, Robert Redford, Lawrence Kasdan, et al.Such a work of art is one selected from a stage play, The Lion In Winter, the play written by James Goldman, 1927 - 1998, who simply converted it to a screenplay.

Watching Katherine Hepburn and Peter O'Toole go to town with their parts is about as close as people of the Twenty-first Century can come to seeing the living, breathing traditions of Nineteenth Century theater come to life - not as a derisive send up, but as an immediate, gripping, vital presentation of human character. Stanislavsky and Strasberg may have changed the rules, but the old ways still work. The highlight a twenty-minute duel in which Henry and Eleanor fight over the succession to the throne of England and Hepburn and O'Toole fight to the death over who will wipe the other off the screen.

This is one hell of a movie-such a roller coaster ride.  If it wasn't so funny in certain spots, it would never have gone over so well.  That's what's missing from historical pieces like Elizabeth today-there's no humor, or very little of it.  Katharine Hepburn and Peter O'Toole (in his second stint as Henry II, but this time in a far better movie) provide most of it in their constant bantering.  I've never seen a couple, on screen or off, that loves to hate yet hates to love each other so much.  Take when they enter the court-Just grant me a little peace! A little peace?  You're too modest; why not eternal peace?  Or after Geoffrey goes through a complicated he knows that we know speil-We're a knowledgable family.  But underneath all the hatred between the sons, and between Henry and Eleanor, you know that Henry and Eleanor love each other-they just can't live with each other.  Henry wants Eleanor when all the sneaking around reaches a climax, not Alais.  Watching them shift back and forth between love and hatred is the heart of the movie, and both actors are absolutely brilliant at it.  Phenomenal movie, even if you aren't too clear on medeival English history.  Watch Becket to get some backstory (also staring Peter O'Toole as Henry II) and Disney's Robin Hood for an exaggerated but pretty accurate picture of what followed.  But know beforehand that neither of these films measure up to The Lion in Winter, so make sure to watch this one again to know what good acting and filmmaking is all about.

And the story and script (swathed in family dysfunction), courtesy of James Goldman, is stunning indeed. Though the royal leads are married, they compete for everything and are at constant verbal odds regarding the successor to the throne and the spoils that go with it. Henry has one favorite son; Eleanor has a different favorite son. Problem is, there are three sons, a mistress, an adoring public, and a visiting king of France- all crashing together during the warm, fuzzy, Christmas holiday.The film's medieval detail is marvelous (shooting was in Ireland, Wales, and France), but the witty, literate, scenes with O'Toole and Hepburn alone are worth the price of admissionEleanor What would you have me do- Give up?

Seriously. You've got Peter O'Toole as this really detached King Henry who is having an emotional fireworks every other scene, Katharine Hepburn, who is the scheming queen with this bitterly dry sense of humor, and their three very emotionally dismantled sons. For years and years, the king and queen have been fighting constantly, simply because they hate each other's guts. (He had an affair with that one, she slept with his father, blah, blah and etc.) Consequently, their kids have turned out as cold, indifferent and greedy to nab the throne once Henry is gone. It is up to the king now to choose which son is worthy to succeed him. He favors the youngest, John, a rather dimwitted lad although Richard (played by Anthony Hopkins) is the eldest. Jeffery is the middle son and his character is just hilarious in that contemplative sort of way. I mean, NEITHER PARENT likes him AT ALL and in almost every speaking part he brings up a disturbing childhood memory. (I remember when I was three...) To top it off, even at Christmas everybody seems to hate one another with a transcendent intensity. (Should we hang the holly, or should we hang each other?)I love the scene where Katharine Hepburn rolls around on the bed and tells her husband how good it felt to sleep with his father! Jerry!

Of course, O'Toole's King Henry I is the more wicked of the two characters, as he seems to thrive on making Hepburn's Queen Eleanor suffer emotionally. But while we sympathize most with Eleanor, there are moments when we pity the King as well, despite his arrogance.  And Eleanor doesn't allow us to feel too sorry for her, as Hepburn plays her as she is in real life, one tough as nails lady.  Eleanor says it so well to the King early in the film, when she's summoned back to the castle from her prison after a long exile.  Stepping off the boat and seeing King Henry I after years of being locked away, she says sweetly to him, Oh, how nice of you to let me out of jail.  The simple line speaks volumes with the way Hepburn delivers it.  There are many more memorable and clever exchanges between the King and Queen, and between them and their three scheming sons (including a younger Anthony Hopkins).

O'Toole would be nominated for best actor again the following year, for Goodbye Mr. Chips, and he would lose to Wayne for True Grit. But one could easily argue (at least I sure would) that if anyone had a complaint about not winning that year, it would have been John Voight, or Dustin Hoffman. O'Toole has been amazing in several films, but I do not think Chips is on the same level of performance as Lawrence of Arabia, The Stuntman, Beckett, or The Lion in Winter.

What I mean by that is that such films are nearly direct adaptations from their stage counterparts. Some common characteristics include lots and lots of dialogue, only one or two locations for scenes, and a focus on the personal and psychological aspects of the characters rather than action or comedy etc. I've known quite a few good ones The Petrified Forest, Glengarry Glen Ross, A Few Good Men, and, as of a few days back, The Lion in Winter.To me, the actual history behind historical films is, more or less, irrelevant (you want to actually find out about history? Then go read about William Wallace the man instead of just watching Mel Gibson impersonate him in Braveheart). What matters is this question is it a good film? The answer for this one is undoubtably yes, thanks to a superior cast and perhaps the fact that James Goldman, the man who wrote the original play, was also the one who did the adaptation. Peter O'Toole, as the 50-year-old Henry II, has become solidified in my mind as the raging enigma of film. When he's onscreen, you literally don't know what he's going to do next...and you get the impression that he doesn't, either. Kate Hepburn is more than a match for him as his acid-tongued queen, Eleanor of Aquitane. Small wonder why he kept her locked up in a tower; she'd had made a meal out of his guts otherwise. Lest I forget, it's also worth noting that this marked the screen debuts of Sir Anthony Hopkins and Timothy Dalton. While Hopkins' performance is not quite up to the standards of his later films, it does give intriguing hints, now and again, of the glories to come. Dalton is a rather pleasant suprise here as the boy king, Phillip II of France. He perfectly captures the repressed venom and frustration of a man who longs to hurt the seemingly unhurtable monarch who stole much of what was rightfully his father's.Yet, it's also worth noting that, for all their scheming, backstabbing, and malice, the entire English royal family do love each other. It's a point that's not made as blatantly as their hostilities, but it is there, nevertheless. That's why Henry couldn't kill his own boys and why he shares a laugh with his queen at film's end. Hate each other they may, but a real family is something you love in spite of all that. And, as Eleanor points out after her next-to-last brouhaha with Henry, what family doesn't have it's ups and downs?

I have been in this play before and it's always been one of my favorites. I played Prince John, Henry's favorite scene, and have to admit I was very angry when he was portrayed in the movie as very dumb and foolish.  In the screenplay, they cut out a lot of scenes where he displays charm and intelligence.  It seems they only kept the idiotic scenes with John. However, all of the other characters were portrayed greatly, with big nods to Peter O'Toole, Kat Hepburn, and Timothy Dalton. This movie has a great story, great dialogue, and a great score.

The excellent young actors, two of whom have become major stars in their own right, held their own, and were given ample screen time to shine. Timothy Dalton as foxy Philip II and Anthony Hopkins as a beefy and discontent Richard the Lionheart had one of the most wrenching love scenes in the history of film.But probably my favorite scenes do have La Hepburn in them.  The scene with the mirror and the jewelry.  I would hang you from my nipples, but you'd shock the children!  Her delivery of that line is absolutely charming and devastating at the same time, as we watch a legendary beauty acknowledging that that beauty is fading, into obscurity.Peter O'Toole rants and raves with the best of them, and his lament of how he's lost his boys, is touching if exasperating. But I would have loved to see how Robert Preston played it, who did it originally on Broadway. There might have been a bit more subtlety there, which I found lacking in O'Toole's performance.Lastly, mention must be made of the excellent score that John Barry crafted for this movie.  He used actual medieval chants and carols, as well as using the monophonic chant notes as the basis of his themes.  I think it was his best score, bar none!!This is a must see for any fans of the medieval and of this historical period in particular.  This is the Eleanor who has lost faith with the Court of Love, who has decided to allow herself to be imprisoned for the sake of the love she still bears Henry, yet finds that love has been trod in the dirt, in favor of a slip of a girl whom she raised as her own daughter.I hope that seeing this movie may convert some of those who have never liked Kate into Kate-a-holics like me.

Couple this with beautiful photography and -- I use the word advisedly -- a great set design evoking the 12th Century, and you have a film for the ages.  The performances of Peter O'Toole, Katharine Hepburn, and Anthony Hopkins were riveting, although I had a hard time forgetting that Hepburn was old enough to be O'Toole's mother &#150; she was 60 or 61 at the time and the quavery voice and shaking head that characterized her later work were already starting to show.  The only weak link in the cast was the young Jane Merrow as King Henry's paramour, Alais, who demonstrated a range of emotion from A to B.  Motion pictures based on stage plays, as `The Lion in Winter' is, often appear staged but this film avoids that.  Even in long exchanges between the actors the great writing and brilliant performances draw us in and make us forget for a moment that this is make believe.  Highly recommended, one of the best.

That is manifestly clear in the dramatic artificiality of everything but  especially that 60's British Stage effect that seems so goofy now. This is a play about  plays - about how each character strives to be the playwright. None of what they claim  matters, not love, crown, power, vengeance - because they do not live in any real world,  but a deliberately acknowledged world of the stage where everyone is either a writer or a  player.All the players act like players. That's why we have such teapot acting, especially from  Kate. So overwrought that if the situation didn't border on farce (complete with bedroom  and multiple hidden schemers ), we would see her as an aged Barberella. Being a mere  actor in this world is equivalent to death.What is interesting is the experiment of having EVERYONE strive to be the author of the  play with control over the others except poor Alais, whose role is ambiguous. Each  character uses a different strategy, each strategy reflecting one of the few philosophies a  writer can take in relation to his work, The two excellent precedents for this sort of  character-as-writer structure are `Alice in Wonderland' and `King Lear,' both of which  are overtly acknowledged. The lines that deal with this striving are expertly crafted. I know of no better in the sense  that terrific shifts from controller to controlled occur seamlessly. Other projects hide all  this behind emotional noise, noise which is absent in this abstract project. There is some  bluster, but it is all accompanied by reasoned dialog. Everything is explained nothing is  hidden. There is no reliance on mere emotion.It is, in other words, terrific writing, the sort that deliberately sets out to make actors  look bad by appearing to make them look good. Check towards the end when king and  queen talk about the eyes eyes in the dark that see them us watchers, but which are  seen by - by whom? The writer.Harvey and Goldman next collaborated on a project with somewhat identical aspirations,  but without the joke on the actors. I much prefer it (`They Might Be Giants') because it  comes the other way actors as writers. We can actually work with the actors. It that film,  the actors create reality by merely taking on the roles.Here, with `Lion,' it feels a little dirty. Either you are privy to the intellectual joke, in  which case you are goofing on all the people who take this at face value. Or you take it at  face value.

The original 1968 take on Lion in Winter is to Kate what All About Eve was to Bette Davis, and, I suppose, Mildred Pierce was to Crawford, and Double Indemnity was to Stanwyck an incomparable diva at her very pinnacle of divadom.Perhaps it's because she almost seemed to peak slightly later (with no horror films or TV series to derail her) but I'd say Kate has the edge.

He has his wife holed up in a prison, is openly contemptuous of his sons, does not honor treaties, has a mistress who is demanding to get married, and exercises his power with an impulsiveness that suggests serious mental problems. Everyone is vying for power and wants Henry out of the way. The problem with the movie is that it asks the audience to accept the premise that the king has cause for concern, when in fact his relatives are so emotionally dependent, divided, and incompetent that they cannot possibly pose a threat to him. In fact the movie suggests that the king's children are so befuddled that they wouldn't know what to do with the crown if it was given to them by the king himself. And as for his wife, she is already played out and as the movie itself shows, is willing to do anything Henry wants. Now if the king was facing an insurrection perpetrated from inside his family, then there's a story, but that is not case in this movie. The king is totally dominant and his position is untenable. This movie is entertaining because it provides an excellent venue for Katherine Hepburn and Peter O'Toole to showcase their talents, which they do successfully, thus making the movie watchable. But to suggest that Henry II should fear for his power is a stretch and in this case, the stretch goes too far. Nevertheless, the movie does succeed as a period piece, albeit with a contrived story. As a period piece that depicts scenes from the middle ages, this movie is probably unsurpassed; however, one must not forget that this movie is a commercial product and work of fiction which takes all kinds of liberties with historical fact, and for good reason the movie is not a documentary but a drama. This does not render the movie any less credible as a work of art. Rather, all it means is that literary people took a certain story and reworked it for dramatic effect, and did so effectively. Can an audience accept the fact that a husband actually locked up his wife? Or that the the potential heirs to the throne are portrayed as sniveling nitwits? Or that the king himself rummaged around his castle with a silly grin or scowl on his face? After watching this movie, one can reasonably wonder how someone as hysterical as Henry II wound up being a king or could have kept his power, since it would not have been especially difficult to goad him into making all kinds of mistakes, and even kings were not invulnerable. But this is why the movie is so good it's fiction based on actual historical personages whose actual lives simply do not conform to Hollywood's idea of a good story. Henry II was not a clod; Eleanor of Acquitane was not such a dainty lady, and their children were people who were destined for power. So enjoy the movie for what it's worth and then afterward read a history book and learn what actually happened.

Essentially a seven-hander, Henry II of England vies for power with his wife, mistress, three sons and the king of France. Each is motivated by a mixture of love, hate and ambition; some (like the King himself) are wildly passionate, others cool and calculating it's testament to the skill of the writing that each presents an utterly distinct character to the viewer, and there are no clear heroes or villains. This is politics as a great game although the piece's theatrical origins are always in evidence (in many scenes, characters openly plot against each other and are always around to overhear their enemies's schemes), this is no bad thing when the dialogue is so sharp. Indeed, much of it is so cutting that it reminded me of 'The Thick of It', suggesting that not so much has changed in politics in eight hundred years. Peter O'Toole and Katharine Hepburn are excellent in the leading roles; I also liked the smooth performance of Timothy Dalton as the French king, although John and Henry's mistress were less fully realised than the other characters.

The movie mostly follows a series of conversations, most of them which are arguments. Unlike other epic films, this one has less fight sequences. The focus is mostly on the tension and dispute between the king, queen and their three surviving sons.Yet, all of it is portrayed quite wonderfully thanks to the eloquent writing, superb direction and of course the excellent performances. The acting may appear loud to some but then again, kings and queens of that time had a reputation for being loud. Peter O'Toole and Katharine Hepburn are both spellbinding and share a fiery chemistry. Their on screen banter is both amusing and to an extent hypnotizing (that's the best adjective I could think of to describe it). I also like how the banter exacerbates like pouring wine in fire but the comic touch remains. John Castle, Anthony Hopkins, Timothy Dalton and Nigel Terry hold their own next to the two transcendent actors.In a way, 'The Lion in Winter' has the effect of watching a splendid play. The sets and costumes are quite simplistic and the cinematography is brilliant. This is quite a different kind of epic movie, it may not be as lavish looking nor as action oriented as what most viewers of today are acquainted with but that doesn't stop it from being a unique gem.

The language isn't true to the era either but I don't mind that at all. Factual or not, James Goldman's script (based on his own play) is top notch. It deservedly won an Oscar and in 2005 was named one of the 100 best screenplays of all time by the Writers Guild of America.The cast is nearly as good as the script and they do Goldman's screenplay justice. Katherine Hepburn's performance took home an Oscar and Peter O'Toole's could have done the same. Unfortunately, he had to content himself with a mere nomination. The supporting cast is also impressive, including Anthony Hopkins and Timothy Dalton in early film roles.I wasn't blown away by Anthony Harvey's Oscar-nominated direction but it gets the job done. The costume design was also rewarded with an Oscar nomination but it's John Barry's Oscar-winning score that stands out on the technical side.All in all, The Lion in Winter is a thoroughly compelling drama with a crackerjack script. Throw in some actors capable of rising to the level of the script and you've got one fine film.

The supporting cast do well to keep up, but they manage, and manage with great style.Catherine Hepburn has one of the most spellbinding entrées that any player could wish for. But it is here I begin to deduct points. Quite why an American actress was cast in such a quintessentially English production is hard to understand, especially when there were any number of eminently suitable English female players equal to a strong woman's role. Margaret Lockwood immediately comes to mind. Viewers may remember her tremendous presence in the 'Justice' TV series during the early 1970's.I suspect that because so much American money went into the production and that it was also intended for Stateside release; a Hollywood favourite was included to make it more palatable to American sensibilities. If this is true, then comments on this website clearly demonstrate that the studios misread their own public's intelligence and discernment.I've had a great deal of respect for Ms Hepburn's abilities, whether bringing up baby, boating with Bogey or rafting with the Duke. But this production called for an English accent, not an American one. Ms Hepburn was simply not equal to the task. I formed the opinion that the script had been slightly 'Americanised' to accommodate her, and again make it more sympathetic to a mid-Atlantic palate. Comments like 'I darn nearly succeeded' belong more to a world of 'injuns' and Winchester rifles.Notwithstanding the above, she makes a sterling effort, and for the most part the repartee is one of the movie's strong suites. But to see how good it might have been, you need to watch 'A Man For All Seasons', with Paul Schofeild.Don't be dismayed, though; if you can get your head around a tantalising suspicion that an arrow-bristling stagecoach migth suddenly deposit John Wayne on set, then damn me all to hell, pilgrim; you're sure gonna love it.

O'Toole bellows at one point, and it is clear O'Toole loves playing one as well. It takes an actress of the caliber of Katherine Hepburn to not disappear alongside a performance like that.Henry, in love with his mistress Alais who is promised by treaty for the marriage of his oldest surviving son Richard, anxiuos for the succession to the throne for the sake of the empire he has built, calls to a palace in his French possessions his three sons, Richard, a fierce and determined warrior who is his mother's favorite - and a favorite of the King of France, as it turns out - the deep-revolving, ignored and unloved middle son Geoffery, and the dull witted youngest son Johnny, his father's pet and choice for succession. He also temporarliy frees the Great Bitch from her prison, his wife, Eleanor of Acquitaine, who he has kept walled up in a castle for ten years, and calls Phillip, the youthful King of France and the son of Eleanor's first husband, in for negotiations. As soon as all five arrive at the castle, they begin to plot with and against and for each other, with Alais, the crown, and Acquitaine as the pawns. No one in tha family likes anyone else, no one is loyal to any one else, and all are willing to betray anyone to win.Are they so different from any unhappy family, whose uneasy alliances and betrayals occur over subjects less momentous to outsiders than a crown? Well, as Eleanor put it, what family doesn't have its ups and downs? All of the major actors - O'Toole and Hepburn, John Castle, a very early Anthony Hopkins and Timothy Daulton, stoop-shouldered, drooling, self pitying Nigel Terry - attack their roles with evident relish. The screenplay sometimes descends to faux profundities and leaden pronouncements, but never for too long. The dialogue sparkles with wit and verbal imagination.But crowning it all off, of course, are Hepburn and O'Toole. They play off their deep abiding love and deep abiding hatred of each other verbally for the entire movie in scenes that can wander wildly from humor to deep pathos as they find with unerring skill exactly the right way to wound each other.

Much praise has been given to acting giants O'Toole and Hepburn as Henry and Eleanor, but far better and more subtle are Anthony Hopkins, John Castle, and Nigel Terry as their sons.  Their first and last scenes characterize them perfectly, from the way Geoffrey directs his forces in the beginning to the way Richard tosses his dagger near the end.Hopkins gives his Richard the Lionhearted a combination of regal bearing, chivalric bravado, agression, and sulking that makes you believe him when he says I am a constant soldier, a sometime poet, and I will be king.  His scenes with mother Eleanor and the French King are particularly good.John Castle's performance as Geoffrey is probably the most impressive. His character, who dies in a joust just 3 years after the movie's events, doesn't have the familiarity or baggage that the roles of Richard and the future King John have (both made famous through the Robin Hood legends), and thus has to be built from scratch.  Castle's Geoffrey truly enjoys scheming, and the fun he has helps to set the movie's tone, where the ins and outs of plotting are very much ends in themselves.The hapless and repulsive John provides a few laughs and some surprisingly funny lines, although not enough reason is given for his being Henry's favorite.It is also worh watching the minor character William Marshall, who was the greatest knight of his age and who has a few scenes here as Henry's right hand man.

It's simple dramatics, breathing life into a fascinating and tumultuous period of history. I'm not sure of the accuracy of the story, since this is one period I'm not particularly strong at, but the film works well and I am perfectly willing to believe it for the moment.The title refers to King Henry II, nicknamed 'the lion', who is having a difficult time not only for the time of year in which it is set but also the stage of life he is at in having to decide which of his three sons will succeed him when he passes on.The film is based on the play by James Goldman, who also wrote the adaptation, and for that reason it has an enormously theatrical feel to it. It's very little more than a play brought to life on the screen, with a proper setting, strong musical score and editing being the only major differences. This is something I would like, since I enjoy the theatre, but it definitely isn't for all film buffs.However, the cast is absolutely perfect, especially Katharine Hepburn as the estranged wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine. She deservedly won an Oscar for her brilliant portrayal of the woman scorned. Peter O'Toole is just as convincing as the King, Timothy Dalton puts in the best performance I have seen as King Philip of France, while Henry's sons are played with great conviction by John Castle, Nigel Terry, and none other than a very young-looking Tony Hopkins as the eldest and most powerful son Richard.The cast work together beautifully to create an array of dastardly and essentially unlikeable characters in a chaotic time in all their lives. As each one plots and conspires, double-crosses each of their allies, to get a different son the inheritance, they weave a wonderfully intricate period tale of greed and power, of trust and betrayal.The film is political as much as it is tragic. I have never read or seen the original play, but the script for the film is breath-taking. The speeches often bear close resemblance to Macchiavelli at times, and there are frequent overtones of the Bard himself and his own historical texts. It's a masterful piece of storytelling.My only complaint is that it is about half an hour too long. There are a number of essentially unnecessary scenes and exchanges that could be deleted to make the film more accessible to a wider audience. It would no doubt reduce the overall effect of the film, but as it stands, it is quite a task to follow every nuance of the story.To sum up, it's a film made mostly through acting. The cast is clearly ideal and they do wonderful things with great material.

Not a word is wasted and every nuance of inflection and timing has bearing on the development of the characters or of the plot.All these actors are of the highest calibre, but it's this film that convinced me completely of Katherine Hepburn's right to every accolade an actor could receive. Peter O'Toole is in the same class and together they portray a gripping relationship of genuine love, overriding ambition and calculated vengeance. Henry and Eleanor have known eachother so intimately that they know every button to push for the desired response. At a time when life was even shorter and cheaper than it is now, it was important to know your friends and enemies and to keep them close.Lion In Winter makes the best possible use of the English language in action as dialogue. We are encouraged to look for the meaning and relevance of every phrase. It's also a great rollercoaster of a plot - twisting all the time. None of these characters are angels - each has an element of true subterfuge, yet we are strongly tempted to take and change sides.Superbly intriguing and a very rewarding way to spend 134 minutes of your life.

They're the epitome of family dysfunction, which should remind us why we fought a war to get rid of the lot of them.  And it's no wonder that they behave this way, seeing as how royal precedent has been set for centuries past.  The Lion in Winter is an outstanding period on Medieval British monarchy, and, in particular, the lives of Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine, two of Britain's most celebrated royals.  Brilliantly portrayed by Peter O'Toole and Katherine Hepburn, respectively, one is reminded that, in 1183, these people were conniving, power hungry, ruthless and not a little bit mean spirited.  They may have come from royal or `noble' lineage;  but, there was little that was noble about their character.  A scholar of Medieval history once said that the primary job of the Medieval kings was `cracking heads.'  In this video, the violence and oppression of the British monarchy comes into focus.  The particular events depicted in the video may never have happened, but the spirit of the times comes through with driving clarity.There are some howlingly funny scenes in this movie.  At one point, when Eleanor is arguing with her three sons (Richard, Geoffrey and John) over which of them should succeed their father as king.  Richard, her favorite (this is accurate historically), draws his knife to attack John, Henry's favorite.  As Richard chases John around the room, brandishing his weapon, John exclaims, terrified, `He has a knife!'  But then Eleanor rebukes John for his stupidity, saying `Of course he has a knife!  This is 1183 and we're barbarians!'  It's a not too subtle wink at the audience;  but, it works.

I DO need to correct one comment.  Someone made the statement that John Wayne had stolen the Oscar from Peter O'Toole for True Grit.  Not true.  It was Cliff Robertson for Charlie who stole the Oscar from O'Toole.  Robertson was a second tier actor at best, not on the same level as O'Toole.  Wayne was a FAR better actor than most people gave him credit for being, although NOT on O'Toole's level, but that's another story.One area that hasn't really been covered by people commenting on The Lion In Winter is the way the film looks. The director's commentary on this gorgeous DVD is illuminating.He talks about the marvelous and spooky stone heads that are used in the title sequences.  They set the tone for this film perfectly.  Carved roughly when this film takes place,they are at once, brutal, beautiful and terrifying! They were discovered by the director on a path in southern France and photographed at night.The beach on which a small, but significant battle is fought under the watchful eye of middle son, Geoffry, is so magically stunning you almost forget to watch the action.  There is a silvery time-warp about that moment that is breath-taking! The beach was found in Wales.Another, filmed on a flooded river in France is so filled with almost swooning mystery and gorgeousness that it seems to be an invocation of a mythical time when dragons roamed the earth.The boat itself looks like a great swan flying over the water with its bird's head-very like Viking and Celtic vessels, and its oars white with tips of brown dipping and rising from the misty water like great wings.  A moment of pure enchantment.John Barry's superb music subtly underlines every word or moment.  It is eerie and magnificent and evokes plain-song and chant. It creates the world in which the characters move and plot, love and hate.  It creates the colors of rock and water, air and spirit as no other film music I have ever heard does.The cinematography is as beautiful as any I have ever seen on film.  Ranking with Black Narcissus and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon for absolute beauty.The Lion In Winter is a great jewel in the crown of acting.

It's also a political thriller, a psychological family study and the lingering end of a tragic love story. It's a character driven film with a superb ensemble cast. As an adaption of a play, it may be too talky for some tastes, but the dialogue is smart and funny. Memorable quotes are peppered in every scene. Katherine Hepburn gets the lion's share of great lines and she puts them to great use. One can't quite say she steals the show, because every character, with the possible exception of Prince John, is masterfully acted. The script didn't give Nigel Terry much to work with, though.The movie is a fictional look at the family of Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine for a couple of days at Christmas in 1183. While the dialogue is anachronistically modern, the setting, score, cinematography and action consistently bring the dark ages to mind. The lighting is realistic. There's straw on the floors and large, shaggy hounds roam the castle. When the characters shout, one can hear a slight echo as their voices bounce off stone walls. In one scene O'Toole must break the ice crust on a basin of water before he can wash his face in the morning and in another he nudges a chicken out of his way to walk forward. The fight scenes are realistically clumsy rather than the sleekly choreographed and glamour dusted action sequences that are standard in Hollywood movies these days. The score is beautiful, regal and sparse, with mostly horns and drums. It's often choral and in Latin, adding to the medieval mood.There are two themes in the plot. The first is of political intrigue in which the characters scheme, lie, manipulate, and double-cross one another for political power. The second is that of a long standing marital conflict with the children as pawns and players, all looking for respect and affection.King Henry II, eldest son having recently died, must select a new heir. He favor's the youngest son, John (the Usurper, of Robin Hood fame, signer of the magna carta). Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine favors the eldest remaining, Richard (the Lionhearted). The middle son Geoffrey favors himself and schemes to have his brothers commit treason (leaving himself as the crown prince), or if that fails, to be chancellor of whichever brother inherits. Adding to the tension is the King of France's determination that his sister Alais (foster daughter of Eleanor, mistress of Henry), either be married or her dowry returned (a strategically sweet piece of land a day's march from from Paris) per a treaty signed 16 years previously.All this would be relatively simple to resolve were it not for the power struggle between Henry and Eleanor. This is really the story of two lions in winter. The succession of inheritance would be simple Henry knows John isn't suitable to be king. The greatest part of his affection for John is that Richard has always been Eleanor's favorite. Likewise Eleanor's determination that Richard get the crown largely springs from her vengeful desire to thwart Henry in whatever he desires. Despite an obvious affection, they've betrayed one another and can't forgive, forget or set aside the pain. Their children show scars from having grown up in the battlefield of their marriage. As Richard accuses Eleanor in a strategy council, The only thing you want is father's vitals on a bed of lettuce. You don't care who wins, as long as Henry loses, you'd do anything. You're Medea to the teeth. Only this is one son you won't use. Richard only half understands Eleanor. She also wants Henry back, though she knows it's hopeless.When I first saw this film, I thought it was the most tragic movie I'd ever seen despite the characters continued health. It can support a larger fan base than emotion junkies though. The politiking is fascinating, unpredictable and complicated. The acting is masterful, from Katherine Hepburn near the end of her career, to Peter O'Toole in his prime, to Timothy Dalton and Anthony Hopkins showing star quality early in their careers. The relatively obscure Jane Merrow also performs excellently considering what she's given. Alais comes across as tender, generous, stalwart and surprisingly resolute when Henry finally offers her marriage. Her brother Phillip, played by Timothy Dalton, is a malicious yet a sympathetic character; he's ambitious, at a disadvantage with Henry, seductive, intense and clever. Anthony Hopkin's Richard is both the brave warrior and the sensitive man and often conflicted. Geoffrey, played by John Castle, maintains a cool facade, but also reveals his damaged internal state. (One wonders why his parents are indifferent to him. Could the name he shares with his paternal grandfather, which rumor has as Eleanor's once-upon-a-time lover have something to do with it?) Peter O'Toole doesn't look like a fifty year old man and he's not, but he is very convincing as a man running out of time, blustering and scheming to settle his kingdom before he dies. Katherine Hepburn is the center of the story and she is flawless. The accolades she won for the role were entirely deserved.The Lion in Winter is a great movie.

True, John was not the greatest of English kings, but the signer of the Magna Carta should have been portrayed with a little more subtlety.The award-winning original score may be a bit strident for the modern listener's taste, and the soundtrack is monaural and rather low-fi, but this is still a great film if you want to see some good acting and learn a little bit about the Medieval period in the process.

Will it be eldest son Anthony Hopkins who has a mean streak in him and a very cold demeanor? Will it be neglected son John Castle who seems a bit too quiet and calculating to be trusted completely? Or will it be youngest son Nigel Terry who has more heart and emotion than intelligence and cunning? O'Toole thinks that Terry should be the one just based upon the fact that he likes him more than his two older sons. Imprisoned wife Katharine Hepburn (who steals the show in her third Oscar-winning role) believes that Hopkins is the man for the job. Mix in the King of France (a young Timothy Dalton) and his sister (O'Toole's mistress Jane Merrow) and you have a complicated would-be-masterpiece that does not completely succeed in the end. Oscar-nominated director Anthony Harvey's shortcomings as a director are the main problems here as the film becomes too talkative very early on and he sacrifices the story for spectacle. The film moves at a snail's pace sometimes and this hinders the progress of the screenplay. Hepburn is excellent, but with the exception of Hopkins she lacks the support to really put the film over the top. Hopkins sizzles on the screen, but his time is not near enough here.

Was Princess Alais really a mistress to Henry II, clingingly obedient even though being constantly debased and belittled by Henry?  Could almost every sentence between Henry and Eleanor of Aquitaine have been as biting, acidic and cynical as Goldman's dialogue?More vexing, though, is the eye-winking tone of the script.  Even though most of the enactment under Anthony Harvey is played dead-seriously, every now and then a modern, hip bit is tossed out.  These throw-aways make one wonder about the integrity--or intention--of Goldman (and Anthony).  Is the whole thing just one big put-on, after all?

Anthony Hopkins plays a sensitive Richard Lionheart, in his debut; Nigel Terry's prince John is a whining little bore; and Timothy Dalton plays the spoilt and vain Philip of France with the same aplomb he gave to Darnley in Mary, Queen of Scots a few years later.Everything is dark and gloomy in 12th century England, and, dialogue aside (some of it is pretty good but doesn't ring true for the period!), not a bad attempt at making a good story out of a few snippets and rumours from history.

Goldman certainly has an ear for language. The idea is to portray a dysfunctional (royal) family's no-holds-barred Xmas hostilities, that will make yours pale in comparison. I used to like this movie, years ago. As the saying goes, Every happy family is the same, but unhappy families are all unique.Unfortunately, the structure of this movie is positively grating. It's an endless sequence of ruses, empty threats, double-backs and nullifications. After about half an hour you realize none of the actors are affecting royalty, they're all portraying thespians; and every character is totally full of crap.Even given that the passing of the crown in the Plantagnet household has not been much of a secret for seven hundred years, the movie fails to make that gambit engaging, and also fails to name the line of succession before the credits roll. I don't ask for much; just move me an inch forward of where we started two hours ago. For every scene that would have worked in a movie half this length, another horrid over-baked piece of rot cancels it out. Every half-interesting character is offset by a runt (John) or a zero (Alais - what the hell is her petulant, whiny purpose in this movie?). The stupid dinner-processional exchange with Hepburn taunting O'Toole through a stupid grin as yet another Styrofoam gauntlet is thrown down, exemplifies the films coy, phony, aggravating conceits. Goldman torpedoes the movie with scene after scene like this. When all is said and done there isn't a piece of scenery left unchewed, and the film quickly reveals itself to be a zero-sum game; my absolute least favorite format.I'm sorry to hear that some drippy viewers think it's funny to see Richard (Hopkins) acting sissified. It's the only moment a viewer could possibly find one of the characters sympathetic, because it's the only frame of legitimate emotion or affection in the whole movie. Only a heartless, narrow-minded ass finds that kind of machismo baggage amusing.

It is an odd concoction. It is visually very appealing with some superb locations and the design is quite good. However, the drama at the center is like Who's afraid of Virgina Woolf? It's a domestic quarrel that goes on and on and on and on. And on. That can work on stage but the real weakness with this film is that the script has two-three modes of writing. It is declamatory almost throughout and when that is switched off, it turns to an apothegmatic form as a means to close of a scene or assert power. Then, in between, those two forms, is the small talk of a bourgeois family. It's quite a curious mixture and rather shallow writing from a technical view.The incongruities are raised due to the casting. Hepburn gives another revision of the spinster schoolmistress type. It's as if she has come straight from The African Queen and talking through clenched teeth is as dogmatic as ever. O'Toole is bombastic, but more like a scared boy who shouts boo to his enemies.The dysfunctional family, sons squabbling with swords over power, is a neat middle class rendering of medieval politics. All in all it's not really that good and what may have worked on stage with cod-Shakespearean dialog and clever put-downs is quite tedious in this film.

For the rest of us, it's not quite so engrossing since we have no clue what the people are talking about. If one thing becomes clear, it is that hardly anyone means what they say, or say what they think, and that their thoughts and intentions change every five minutes; which does unfortunately not help to elucidate the historical facts. We probably can believe the king when he declares he likes being it, but this is not much of a revelation.

I mean this just goes on and on and on. The dialogue is clever but its just a little too clever, and it becomes too much a 20th century motion picture than the period piece of its intent. Henry has 3 surviving sons, Richard the Lionhearted, Geofrey The Forgotten and John Lackland of Robin hood and Magna Carta fame. The premise of the film, a sort of King Learish, How Shall I Leave My Kingdon Within the timespan of about a week id say, the inheritance flipflops between all three brothers, wars are declared and then rescinded, and a sumptious Christmas feast is enjoyed. Its too much, too cluttered and too forced. Peter OToole, I suppose hes a great actor but his manic depressive style now seems a product of 1960s and its just hard to take seriously now. Katherine Hepburn as usual, is too old for her role, but I think she redeems herself better than her male counterpart. The 3 princes in all fairness, are superbly acted. If you are a history buff, you may draw some satisfaction out of seeing these famous historical occurences dramatized but you may just get weary of it all and pick up your copy of War and Peace for relaxation. For a better execution of British history on the silver screen, see instead A Man for All Seasons.

Okay, that sounds like a normal family reunion. Hmmm&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;.This movie was made in 1968 and I would hope that if a remake is considered that the dialogue be cut drastically so the players don't take forever to deliver their lines. That was the problem with me and the movie. Each player gave forth numerous mini-soliloquies at break-neck speed that one loses the point and ends up just watching facial contortions -- and both Hepburn and O'Toole are great at that. And, somewhat overplayed too. If a remake is done, the dialogue give and take should be shorter so the audience can follow what is going on more easily. To be fair, one can follow the thread pretty good, but the characters go on and on and on. Gets to be annoying. No, I wasn't impressed with the screenplay. The movie leaves up in the air which son takes over as king, but years later Henry II dies and Richard becomes king. He was also known as Richard the Lion Hearted. Hey, I looked it up. Now, what do we know about mirrors in the middle ages? Mostly that they were made of highly polished metal, not glass.

This, plus the fact that all the squabbling is done in archaic English (it takes place in 1183 so modern prose is out of the question), is fair warning that unless you're a history buff, this is not the film for you.I myself remained pretty detached throughout, wondering why on earth KATHARINE HEPBURN received an Oscar for playing Eleanor of Aquitaine who had a few clever one-liners but mostly delivered all of her lines with either brutal sarcasm or silky sweetness and had little else to work with in the way of character development.Nor was I overwhelmed by PETER O'TOOLE as Henry II, unhappy with his wife and his sons and arguing with them from the moment the festivities begin. It's rather taxing to have to witness all of this unsettling talk for well over two hours with the net result that nothing is settled by the end of the story.

The movie portrays the assorted plotting and deception at the 1183 Christmas court arranged by the aging English King Henry II at his castle in Chinon, Anjou (located in present day France). Other notable personages at the court include Henry's estranged wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine, their three sons (Richard, Geoffrey, and John), the young & inexperienced but cunning King Philip of France, and Philip's sister, Princess Alais, who is also Henry's mistress though promised as a wife to one of Henry's sons. For years Henry has kept the scheming Eleanor imprisoned in a tower, because of the disquieting tendency she exhibited to plot civil wars against her husband. The question at this court revolves around the royal succession, with all three sons vying openly and not very charmingly for the crown. Henry prefers his youngest son, John, as his heir, while Eleanor champions Richard as the future King. (Their oldest son, Henry, died earlier.) Suffice it to say, not one of these sons would make a parent proud. Richard, Mummy's favourite, is a courageous though brutal and inwardly tortured warrior. Geoffrey, the neglected middle son, is treacherous and conniving. John, Henry's pet, is puny, pathetic, dirty, and drooling. The film does have an intriguing premise, though the events of this Christmas court never transpired historically. However, before the movie was half finished, I grew bored of all the repetitive skulduggery and intrigue. Frankly, much of it comes across as ridiculous. For example, the scene in which Henry and Philip are conspiring, with the three princes concealed behind two sets of curtains, appears the essence of absurdity...a scenario that a middle school student might have concocted. Throughout the movie, the truth is seldom spoken, with various deals made to trade the kingly inheritance for marriage to Alais or rights to Aquitaine...false deals made and then broken. After the first two or three of these, the double dealing grew predictable, repetitive, and tedious. The film does portray, I admit, the lingering underlying affection between Henry and his Queen, despite all their bickering and scheming. I suspect that this is intended to be the entire point of the movie. The jealousy of the aging Eleanor toward the lovely young Alais (to whom she had served as surrogate mother) failed to elicit much sympathy from me, even when she rather bizarrely insisted upon watching the pair kiss.Admittedly, the movie has a few merits. There is indeed a moving scene in which Henry is walking along the castle ramparts, totally distraught and having basically disinherited his three sons, the sorry lot of them. The acting is stellar with Peter O'Toole as Henry, Katharine Hepburn as Eleanor, Anthony Hopkins as Richard, and Timothy Dalton as the French King. Also, my compliments to the medieval castle setting and the musical scoring, especially during the scene depicting the arrival of Eleanor's barge.Many applaud the dialogue in this movie, but I found it far too laced with anti religion profanity. There is indeed some clever and witty banter especially between Henry and Eleanor, but also considerably less brilliant comments such as 'Piss on your peace'. Also, I consider flippant remarks about carpenters' resurrections downright sacrilegious. If the film is intended to be Shakespearean, I can only comment that the Bard managed to convey both humour and intense emotion quite remarkably with language considerably less profane. I believe this film to be vastly over rated and in fact dull viewing. Also, there isn't much historical enlightenment, although at least it has encouraged me to perhaps watch Peter O'Toole's earlier film, Beckett, and investigate a little more fully for myself the actual details on some of these figures' lives.
