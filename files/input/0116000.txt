This time, the team is shy one member (Jesse) but it really seems no different. I do still wonder what happened to all those people who played in the first movie and were never heard from again. Oh well.In this film, it's almost a rehash of the first film. A team who cannot get it together, get a washed up hockey player who they hate to coach them and they love him...your basic family fun, Disney flick.All in all this was a great movie, but hopefully Disney realizes that we've had enough.*** out of **** "},{"Title":"LOUSY!

Second, they are placed in a good academy, but are treated like dirt, and are badly bullied by bigger kids on the varsity team. There is very little hockey played, and like he should be--Charlie is furious with the new coach (a jerk at first) and the awful time he's having. Things improve, but what I hated was that their good friend Hans died. BAD ENOUGH THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT IN REALITY, so why did they make them lose such a close friend?! FINALLY, things start improving, when coach O'Rion gets his head out of his butt and starts being nice. UNFORTUNATELY, Bombay never comes back! They win the Hockey game and get their two MVPs back, but don't have what they started with! Not only that, but it was just a TERRIBLE ending to the great first two movies!

In the first place he should of been their coach through the series. This movie also had a lack of hockey. How realistic is it to come back from 9-0 in one period of hockey? Disney you need to give me a break. Here is also something unrealistic. Don't you think the ducks would be the varsity team? In D2 they went to the junior good will games and played on team USA. They should be able to easily beat the real varsity team. Like Adam Banks said in D2 they were good enough to play against the world. Coach Orion was annoying too. Bad mistake for Bombay to leave. Like I was saying before the movie had a lack of hockey. Throughout the movie you only see them play three games. Here are the positive things to say. The pranks were funny.

'D3' is just really enjoyable stuff. Emilio Estevez isn't around much (still billed first in the credits, though) and he is missed despite the original film's central relationship between him and the kids being repeated here with a new coach. But there's enough here that's new to the series (if not to cinema in general) to make this worthwhile once the weak opening is out of the way.David Newman's score is genuinely good, making the hockey games rousing - as in 'D2', easily the highlight of the movie - and giving the movie real momentum.

Just a disgrace. I think what Disney was trying to do was change things up a bit by adding some new characters, but in doing so they took away probably some of the best.THE BAD 1. A new coach-I don't even remember the new coach's name, he doesn't deserve to be remembered. This movie was bad five minutes into it when they announced Bombay was out. *Bad*2. Loss of players- Where's Jesse Hall? and Dean Portman? and everyone else they had that was so likable? Why'd they put Banks on Varsity? Why was Disney so dumb?3. Bad humor- These players are now and high school and the humor is less mature than either of the first two movies. These kids were more rebellious when they were thirteen. That makes no sense.4. Acting- Oh My God. Enough said5. Hans- Why? Why Hans? Why kill Hans? He was like, a roll model. I loved Hans in the first one. I hated this movie so much.THE GOOD 1. What They Realised- Disney realised that they needed to stop being big dumb dumbs and bring the old characters back. So Portman came back, that was good. And Bombay came back. I really hope this is the last Mighty Ducks movie, because the only thing that brightened my day was the ending, when Bombay walked out the door to the theme song, and then the flashback of the ending of the first movie came on. That left me feeling better. And I thought, wow, good way to end itThe ending gets a ten out of ten but doesn't make the movie good enough so overall a 2/10...only gets a 2 because of the end.

The Ducks have, en bloc, won scholarships to the snobbish private school Banks (Vincent LaRusso) attends. This offends the sensibilities of the varsity hockey team. WHY it offends them is never made entirely clear, since the Ducks will probably assure continuing championships for their school, establishing a dynasty tradition of which the current varsity players will be the spearhead. Much mayhem ensues as the two rival cliques play vicious trick after vicious trick upon one another. (I don't consider covering someone with fire ants or dining and dashing on an $853 restaurant bill to be jokes -- they are just plain sadistic.) A very thinly veiled sadism is apparent throughout D3. The final victory of the Ducks is *not* achieved through skill, expertise, or courage -- it is achieved by physically brutalizing the varsity team. (Is it a spoiler to reveal what any eight year old knows even before watching a Mighty Ducks movie? They *never* lose The Big Game. Watching these things is about as suspenseful as watching moss grow.) In the most egregious act of brutality in the movie, one of the varsity players is hurled off the rink, through the glass enclosure, and into the stands, which is physically impossible, which may be why the crowd grows wild cheering for it -- ignoring the very real possibility that the varsity player has broken one or both legs, possibly his spine, and has undoubtedly received a concussion. This is a *good* thing because the now permanently crippled high school student doesn't like Pacey ... er ... Charlie.One of the stupidest moments is the saving of the scholarships of the Ducks (yeah, the same old stuff Disney has been spewing out since Tommy Kirk and Kurt Russel were doing teen comedies for them). Their attorney (of course the Ducks have an attorney!) argues that the scholarships offered to and accepted by the Ducks is a contract binding the school to allow the Ducks to play hockey. Hunh? What fool writes a scholarship grant which gives the recipient power over the grantor and the school? What kind of Mickey Mouse lawyer did the school have writing those things? (Maybe that was the problem -- they needed one of the Mouse's attorneys.) Even more idiotic is the moment when the Ducks are allowed to keep their own team name and colors instead of being Eden Hall Warriors. What? The baseball, basketball, and football teams are going to change *their* team names and colors because of a freaking *hockey* team?!?! In Canada, maybe, but this ain't set in Canada.Yeah, the kids are cute, but ... well, that is the *only* thing this piece of duck dreck has going for it. Watch it with the sound off and look at their perfect, pretty punims. Nothing anyone says in this thing is worth listening to. It is certainly nothing that children should be allowed to watch -- this thing is so viciously, sadisticly violent that I think the MPAA should have given it an R rating -- no one under 17 admitted without a parent or guardian.

The scrappy, wise-cracking kids that formed The Mighty Ducks hockey team are now full-blown teenagers, voice-changes and all. This time around, they are awarded scholarships to the prestigious Eden Hall Academy, a school who take their hockey just a bit too seriously. Emilio Estevez's character is written out of most of the movie, making way for the hard-headed Coach Orion (Jeff Nordling), who leads The Ducks under their new moniker, The Warriors. As they fight for dominance with the varsity team, they also have to fight for their right to stay in school, lest the school board revoke their scholarships and cast them out simply for not fitting in. Along the way they learn more valuable life lessons and grow with one another, yada yada yada, so on and so forth.If it feels like the formula is wearing thin, that's because it is. Don't be mistaken, D3 is of the same caliber as D2 The Mighty Ducks. It's an entertaining enough, simple and nostalgic sports flick that appeals to the whole family, but is nowhere near as inspiring and as spirited as the original. When compared to the original The Mighty Ducks, this is just a ho-hum sequel that offers nothing new and is obviously made with intentions of milking a franchise name, which is made abundantly clear by its low budget look. But when it comes to Disney and its track-record for sequels, would you expect anything less? It's not all bad though. The acting from the kids is spot on and their chemistry is great as usual. Hans (Joss Ackland) makes his return to the series and even though Emilio Estevez looks tired in the twenty minutes or so he spends in the film, it's better than not having him at all. His turn as the Ducks' lawyer is a stand-out, a nice call-back to the original film. Overall, D3 The Mighty Ducks is a contradiction, a mediocre display of nostalgia. It's entertaining enough, but too bland to really have a lasting effect. See it if only to complete the trilogy (although I get the feeling that if Disney felt they could, they would have forced more movies out of it) and to reminisce in the good old days, before Emilio Estevez faded away completely, before Joshua Jackson became irritating and before Kenan Thompson went SNL.

It has all of Ducks attending college at Eden Hall University, where they are considered worthless scrubs. In order to prove themselves, they need to beat the Eden Hall varsity squad. The reason this movie is lacking is because Emilio Estevez, the standout star of the previous 2 movies, disappears 5 minutes into the movie, and does not even make another appearance until the end. Another reason is because some fan-favorites from the first two did not make it to the third, including the Hall brothers, Jesse and Terry, Peter, and Karp. Although the movie recieves a huge lift when Dean Portman returns to the squad and helps them win the game against the varsity team, it does not have the same feeling of a camaraderie as the first two.

They're part of the same school, why should this game be a big deal anyway ? Then the Warriors become the Ducks ? Usually those games are set in pre- season but the biggest disappointment is that there is no structured story. The fact that there is little to no hockey makes this very disappointing because at their age, the game is much more serious and yet they look like cartoons. You can't play that cartoon card every time and it shows and that's the biggest mistake.Plus, the hockey sequences are poorly filmed, you don't know what's going on on the ice, who's doing at what spot, it's a headache. Bombay shouldn't have been in the movie, Jackson's puberty voice makes him sound cheesy and he hardly puts much effort in his acting, Goldberg is the funniest of all, Averman who used to be the funny-haha character isn't much fun, and basically what bothers me in this movie is there is no more team fraternity. Where's the chemistry, the bonding ? The focus was the team and Bombay of course, but in Ducks 3, Charlie is the focus and it doesn't work. Any kid will hop on the bandwagon but looking back I'm sure they'll find D3 the least interesting of the bunch.

Second, the thing that bugs me was Coach Orion's preach defense gig. 1-0 games are boring as it is, and the Ducks used to win games by high scoring margins. The defense may win hockey games but its boring to watch, especially in movies. Another thing was what was up with the 9-0 comeback? You mean to tell me a high school hockey team scored 9 goals in 15 minutes? The Ducks goalie was supposed to be good....that's absolutely terrible. I can see why the balance shifted from Gordon to Charlie because Gordon wasn't really apart of it, but to give him top billing wasn't a good idea. The subplots and the hijynx were fine but wouldn't the Dean notice a thousand fire ants loose in the dorm rooms? Lastly, where was their emotional fireball Jesse Hall? He just disappear from the script? Was Brandon Adams not available for the movie? Although I must say I can see why the ducks aren't the varsity team seeing as they were supposed to be freshman (character wise) and the varsity appeared to be juniors and seniors.

Although I am no critic, I can honestly say as an average person who grew up in the 90's that this movie is a lot of fun.It starts out with the same team from the second movie (excluding Jesse Hall) receiving scholarships to a hockey-championship-winning high school. The school's varsity team immediately shows their disdain for the Ducks, and the varsity and the ducks continue their rivalry throughout the movie with outrageous pranks that finally ends with the big showdown hockey game. The rivalry between the two teams is what makes the movie most memorable, with pranks that make you laugh (although they seem incredibly unbelievable and over-the-top).The return of the actors from the second movie is wonderful, it is the exact same team, except for Hall which was mentioned above. Also, Emilio Estevez returns as Gordon Bombay although in a much smaller and less-involved role. Still, less of Bombay is better than no Bombay. The new coach, Orien, is an interesting character who clashes with Charlie Conway, again played by Joshua Jackson. Another great factor in the third movie is the return of Hans from the first movie, and his death leads to possibly the most touching moment in all three Ducks movies. And of course, it wouldn't be a great Ducks movie without the return of characters like the Bash Brothers. Portman returning at the end made the entire movie for me, personally.While many people may think that this movie was a poor sequel that had none of the charm of the first two movies, I have to strongly disagree. I first saw the movie as a kid when it came out and I loved it for its goofiness and memorable characters.

The soundtrack is great, and Jeffrey Nordling steps into the coach's shoes with enthusiasm with Emilio Estevez making a brief appearance. The Mighty Ducks themselves are performed with real spirit also and the few ice hockey scenes are well choreographed. However, where the film is lacking is in the plot, the plot weren't the greatest in the first two films but here it was really predictable and uninspired coupled with uneven pacing. And while I liked the scripting in the first two, it is fairly weak here. Joss Ackland's role is rather cartoonish, more to do with how the character was written rather than acted, and the direction is nothing special. Overall, merely average and worth seeing, but there are a few components here that make it the weakest of the franchise. 5/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"The ducks have flown the coop!","Date":"13 November 2006","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Drama","Review":" Now I hate this saying, because frankly, there are so many actors who have been horribly typecast as kids because of this saying, but The Might Ducks movie doesn't work as well with the grown up ducks! Now I didn't have too many problems with this film, I just wasn't that impressed or moved by it. I think many would agree, it's like seeing Rocky in Rocky 5, he's so old and you're afraid that he's going to break a hip boxing. Well, that's D3, the kids are more grown up and less interesting because we know when they become teens, they're less interested in what kept them happy as children.The kids have scholarships to one of the best high schools, and now have a new coach, Coach Orion. Orion is completely different from Gordon, he's a little tougher and has more rules, but you learn why he is that way later on. The kids also have to worry about the Varsity team of the high school, because this is the team that has the big time seniors on it that want to pick on little freshman. And they do so through silly 5 year old pranks.While it's not a terrible movie, I liked the second Mighty Ducks a little better and it worked more than D3. But I can see this movie working for pre-teens, I'm serious, because I think they could relate to the film a little bit of being the new kids in school. But for adults alone, I'm not sure, to each his own.

That was about my biggest turn-off right now. The fact that it was a bunch of preps just dealing it out on the ice, giving out some hard-knock schooling on the ice.The fact is, most of the original characters apparently no longer exist, and that is probably a major downfall. The plot wasn't the greatest plot of all-although it does show actual realistic details, such as the treatment of new freshman on the campus. The pranks that these the varsity and junior varsity teams pull are completely ridiculous, and most likely, wouldn't be found in such a highly scholar school.The coach was a complete loser, and that is completely impossible that one man can change or mature within a small time of frame.Another turning point is that there is no-mention of Han's companion (who went back to the Old Country in D2) but, Han's dies. This is a very upsetting time, and does take the comedy effect off of the Mighty Ducks series which appeared to be the main reason for the creation of the series to begin with.As Theodore Taylor once told Gary Paulson, Never create a prequel or following up to an excellent work, they usually end up with a foul feeling in the audience, and it can really ruin ones career.

One of the worst actors in this movie is the varsity head coach. He really overacts and his lines sound As always the ducks are underdogs and for some reason can't beat the big bad varsity who isn't really impressive. I found one of the most annoying characters besides the varsity coach is the announcer for the games. That kid has no acting talent and he must be a relative of someone at Disney which got him the role. Let's not forget Charlie crying all the time about losing his C. A real leader doesn't need a C on his jersey to lead. It looks like Eden Hall is supposed to resemble Shattuck St Mary's in Minnesota which is a well known hockey high school.

Charlie is now the loose canon Gordon was at his age and along with his poor attitude towards his new coach Charlie starts to go downhill fast. Emilio is a gun in this movie and he is my favorite character and Coach Orion (Jeffrey Nordling) is my second favorite and they both put in stellar performances. The great speech about Defence by Coach Orion is a classic quote and is very true even in my sport Soccer and life. It's one of my favorite quotes of all time from any movie. The Minnesota Miracle Man scene is a highlight and Emilio is just class. The music choreography in D3 is excellent. It was so well done and example is when the Varsity team starts picking up the hitting and the music behind the scene starts saying Beat em in a opera like voice. The music complements the situation well throughout the whole movie and is one of its major pluses.D3 definitely has it's dull parts and some poor acting at times but at other times the acting is pretty good. However, the Hans in this movie doesn't rate well against the previous actors who played Hans.The plot follows the usual pattern of, pranks against the bad or rival team and the initial, I hate the coach attitude and then the coming together and uniting as a team and as friends once more to for fill the aim of defeating the rival team.

It's more about rivalry, childish antics, and snobbery than hockey. And whose bright idea *was* it to bring in a new, cardboard cut-out coach and put Emilio Estevez on the sidelines anyway??

It's like, you may have been in the olympics, but this is high school hockey, and we're varsity, we're better than olympics.  If the varsity guys are so good, why weren't they olympics?  Secondly, are they really freshmen?  If I remember correctly, at the end one of them is kissing an upperclassman cheerleader.  And there's no one some of them are freshmen.  Third, high schools don't recruit entire teams, and close tryouts to no other freshmen than those on that team.  It's against the rules.  The only people that tried out were the Ducks and varsity.  Another thing, where's the Junior Varsity team?  Schools don't do just Freshman and Varsity.  Fourth, so many people are missing from the first movie.

The premise is absolutely ridiculous and downright bizarre. I am confused as to how a screenplay can be approved that calls for such a plot line. I'm not going to get too far into it, but the SOLD OUT exhibition contest between the freshman team (the Ducks) and the varsity will go down in cinematic history as one of the most dubious acts ever put on film. You'll have to see it to believe it. The school, which is supposed to foster fair play and excellence, encourages the varsity to resent the freshman to the point that only a hateful exhibition between the two teams can settle the matter. And oh yeah, the freshman (our heroes) somehow raise enough money in time to purchase brand new uniforms for the meaningless game. And after they win, the school instantly changes its official mascot to...you guessed it...the Ducks!!!Here is an overview of some of the aspects that irritate me about this film-The meaningless scrimmage between the varsity and freshman is 100 percent sold out and broadcasted on the radio with an NHL superstar as a between period guest. -There are too many blatant hockey infractions during the scrimmage to count. -One of the varsity players is flipped over the boards and falls into the crowd as the glass shatters, which is completely impossible. -The varsity hates the freshman even though they are all part of the same hockey program. Why would you resent a team that will someday carry on the rich hockey tradition that you helped establish? -The new uniforms! Again, what is the logic in raising THOUSANDS of dollars to purchase uniforms for a game that doesn't even count. OK, maybe they are from a previous season. Still, why not show a little school pride and wear the uniforms assigned to you? For a group desperately trying to fit in, refusing to wear the institution's uniforms is a slap in the face. -The school apparently was planning on the freshman winning because after the game (scrimmage), a large Mighty Ducks banner is unveiled displaying the academy's new mascot...the Ducks. Wow! I don't think I need to elaborate on that one. -Why are the scholarships being pulled? The only hint we are given is because the kids don't quite fit in. Are you serious? -The over-the-top cheesiness of the ending. There is way too much making out and kissing.
