[{"Title":"Funny, but I didn't laugh.","Date":"30 July 2004","Score":"37 out of 47 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  Lawrence Kasdan has never been known for his comedy, per-say. He is perhaps best known as the screen writer on the best Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Empire Strikes Back, as well as his own The Big Chill. Mumford may be the most representative of his talents. It is widely agreed that Kasdan was brought into the Star Wars and Indiana Jones movies to add a bit of humor to the films. This is most noticeable in the change from Raiders of the Lost Ark to the Temple of Doom, as 'Temple' is not nearly as enjoyable as Raiders, as it is missing much of the wit that has become a tired action clich√© of late. Kasden has some of the back and forth in this movie, with smart responses that make you smirk. But most of the movie centers around the plot, which is about a man named Mumford that no one seems to know much about but everyone talks to. Throughout the film Mumford helps his patients realize what they need, which seems to be their only problem. Occasionally he takes an active role, but often all he does is listen. Loren Dean plays the role with a carefree attitude that wouldn't work in most films but fits right on the money here. His indifference makes him the perfect person to talk to. The supporting cast, especially Hope Davis, Alfre Woodard, Jason Lee and Mary McDonnell are outstanding, although a lot of attention was paid to casting, and you can tell. Everyone seems to fit their role well. Mumford doesn't have gut-busting laughter or moments of pure hilarity, it rather trucks along in a more traditional idea of comedy, and send-back to the old days of comedy when people cared about atmosphere and character. The biggest achievement of this movie is that nothing is said to take you out of the feeling that you are watching real people, which is a hard thing in comedy these days. The movie doesn't make a huge impact, and, if I weren't so in love with it, it would be quite forgettable, as it probably is to many people. However, it is the only movie in a very long time where I left the theater smiling because I had been emotionally moved. And that's the most impressive thing of all.

In a way, this movie from writer-director Lawrence Kasdan is like that.  A lot of people have complained at how slow moving this is, but it's all the better for it to sneak up on you.  And instead of just providing quick fix solutions for his patients, Mumford just gently prods and nudges until they find the path for themselves.  Of course, this may just be an elaborate way of saying, Physician, heal thyself, but that may be the point.If you look at this in one way, you might think Mumford is merely a passive character, who only comes to life when he falls in love and when his secret is revealed.  But gradually, you come to realize what's going on.  Not only is his reticence a cover(a good one until he's exposed), but it's a way of, as I said, just gently prodding his patients to the right path.  So he is active, but just in subtle ways.  You need a subtle actor to handle that, and Loren Dean does quite a good job in that department.  Hope Davis, who if there's any justice in this world will become a star, is also good as the patient he falls in love with.  Their scenes together reminded me of the relationship between William Hurt and Geena Davis in THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST, a Kasdan film this shares a lot with.  And the rest of the cast is quite good as well(it's also nice to see Elisabeth Moss, so good in IMAGINARY CRIMES, still getting work, though I hope it's bigger roles in the future).My only complaint was the scene where Mumford explains to Jason Lee(also excellent) and us what his past really was.  The details themselves were okay, but the sequence was shot in grainy video stock(I think; I'm not an expert here), which, while it pays off later, is distracting here, particularly with its point-of-view camera.  Still, this is a minor quibble for a movie which will leave you with a big smile on your face the entire way through.

Starting out, the movie is slightly oddly paced and just throws you into the plot with little explanation as to what's up.  The script unfolds expertly and does a great job of drawing you into the storyline and the very believable characters.  It's extremely funny in a low-key way with most of the humor coming as a quick comment delivered dead-pan.  It's the sort of flick where all of the characters are great because they're so quirky that they are funny in and of themselves.  The overall message of the movie is also a good one.  Definitely reccomended viewing.By the way, you get to see Jason Lee skate a bit.  Cool beans.

It is very reminiscent of some of the work of the great directors of Hollywood's Golden Era Frank Capra, Ernst Lubitsch and Preston Sturges. I cannot imagine categorizing this film. It is not a pure comedy, although it provides moments of cleverness and humor. But there is also a significant element of dramatic tension. It is certainly no intellectual tour de force, however, it is much more than a way to while away 100 minutes (or whatever the length of the film is). It is not a morality play, although you might find something meaningful to take away with you. It is a finely crafted, subtly nuanced, multi-faceted film, mirroring its title character. You might conclude from other opinions that Mumford (the character) is passive out of timidity or lack of purpose or even in order to preserve his anonymity. However, I believe he is passionate about his profession and has a very clear philosophy and purpose. I think his therapeutic prescriptions for his patients represent sympathetic, compassionate and very intentional interventions in their lives. However, his persona is low-key and his methods of intervention are indirect. Thus their dramatic impact seems to be just the natural consequence of the patients' living their own lives - just as the good doctor intends.This kind of subtlety is in short demand and hence supply in the contemporary world of in-your-face computer generated special effects, one dimensional characters and unimaginative dialog. But, if you enjoy films like Grand Canyon, The Accidental Tourist, Local Hero and Passion Fish, you'll like this film. It is driven by a great balance of plot and well developed characters, played by a wonderful ensemble cast.

Mumford is the name of a small fantasy town, filed with smiling people greeting each other on a daily basis, which is held in upheaval when a small time psychiatrist's true entity is revealed to his various patients.I am getting ahead on myself, here. Before I can explain what happens after the characters discover the secrets about Mumford, the name of psychiatrist also, I must first give you some background information on the characters. The mismatched characters are eccentric and entertaining. They are developed though sessions with Mumford. To make things even more original for the movie is the lack of plot structure here. The conflicts, problems and solutions all exist in each individual character, not necessarily a situation they are placed into. With Mumford included, here are the characters Sofie Crisp, (Hope Davis), who is nearly bedridden after a severe and almost permanent loss of energy. Henry Follett (Pruitt Taylor Vince) whose mind is overflowing with wild and erotic sex fantasies, but he isn't featured in any of them. Skip Skipperton, (Jason Lee) a young, skateboarding corporate billionaire that is so lonely and without friends that he has spend the last several years designing robots to fit individual's sexual pleasures. Nessa Watkins, (Zooey Deschanel) who has social, smoking, relationship, and obsession issues. Lionel Dillard, (Martin Short) a lawyer who's disturbing images Mumford refuses to listen to. Jeremy Brockett (Ted Danson), who is great to himself but treats his family members like dirt. Dr. Ernest Delbanco (David Paymer) and Dr. Phyllis Sheeler (Jane Adams), the only other two mental health doctors in Mumford who question Mumford's creditability. And finally, there is the Mumford character himself, played by Loren Dean, who has such a compelling flashback sequence developing his entire life in five minutes effectively, we learn that this man also had some problems, he just was willing to turn his life around. This character alone makes the film worth while to see, for his mysterious past life is such a revealing subject that it is hard not to become intrigued. 	There is much to like about Mumford. There are the enormously entertaining characters, who are not puppets of the plot, but contain their own personal emotions and motives. A charming, imaginative atmosphere. The direction by Lawrence Kasdan is focused and organized; he seems to know exactly what he wants, and achieves it. The personal territory the film's story covers, a psychiatrist mind, as well as the thoughts of many disturbed individuals, is quite compelling.  Also, I think there is an important message here, signifying the need of people to communicate to one another and how important it is to listen to each other--values everyone should have. 	The conclusion to Mumford  contains no big, extravagant climax. Nor does it completely bring the film's message to a direct close. It is a happy, petty ending in which almost everyone goes home happy, but still lets the imagination wonder. This ending only provides the fact that this is a character and mood movie, not a plot based movie. It ends how it needs to end, assuring this film will stick with the viewer for sometime to come.Brought to you by Touchstone Pictures.

There is so much that is wholesome, humorous, and down-to-earth about this movie. The story revolves around a man with a gift for listening to others share their most intimate secrets. He arrives in the town of Mumford, sets up shop in a modest office, and begins the practice of listening to people's problems, gaining a reputation for being an effective listener among the good citizens of Mumford. Much of the story follows multiple, intertwining threads of lives lived, intimate secrets revealed, and romances started, all because of one man's ability to listen. On a repeat viewing of the movie, many scenes clicked for me that I didn't understand or appreciate the first time I watched it. Mumford is truly delightful and will appeal to those who know the meaning of live and let live and who believe in getting (and giving others) a second chance in life. The ending was absolute perfection - a total delight and incredibly refreshing.

Among his clientele are local chemist Henry Follett (Pruitt Taylor Vince) whose tasteful sexual fantasies have ruined his marriage, image-obsessed teen Nessa Watkins (Zooey Deschanel), kleptomaniac house-wife Althea Brockett (Mary McDonnell) and lonely billionaire Skip Skipperton (Jason Lee), whose electronics business keeps the town afloat. Mickey Mumford and his highly unorthodox techniques are extremely successful, but things begin to change and get complicated when he takes Sofie Crisp (Hope Davis) on board as a client and falls in love with her, while trying to cure her sleep deprivation. 'Mumford', written and directed by Lawrence Kasdan (The Bodyguard, The Big Chill) is a surprisingly great film. Really, this is just a very well-told story. Dr. Mumford's curious cases pull the film along, but those fragmented stories really wouldn't have been enough for 99 minutes&#133; so when the film's big twist comes mid-way, it's a smooth transition from examining Mumford's patients and their crises to watching the problems of the doctor himself, and the way's he tries to deal with them. Loren Dean, while not the typically charismatic protagonist, is oddly interesting as the humble and odd psychologist; and really does communicate a very relaxed persona, making it easy to see why people feel the need to confide in him. Zooey Deschanel is a great little secondary character, totally at ease and entertaining in her role as the off-beat misfit. My one complaint may be that the love story between Dr. Mumford and his patient Sofie isn't executed very well; there really isn't enough screen time given to the development of their budding feelings, and in fact most of their realizations about their feelings for one another come either off-screen or are explored individually, like when Dr. Mumford talks about his feelings for Sofie with patient and friend Skip Skipperton. Furthermore, there isn't much chemistry between Loren Dean and Hope Davis. Between Davis's sleep-deprived, baggy-eyed divorc√©e, Sofie and Dean's stony-calm Dr. Mumford; the romance is lackluster, at best. The film is only 99 minutes long, and I wish it was longer with more emphasis and development on the Dean/Davis romance. I really enjoyed this film and was very glad I found it while looking through Zooey Deschanel's filmography. It's just a shame not more people know about it.

Mr. Kasdan created an enigmatic man, Dr. Mickey Mumford, who appears in the small town out of nowhere. He quickly goes to become an indispensable person in the community with his no-nonsense approach to psychiatry.Mumford touches the lives of the people that come to him seeking his advice. Among the people he helps, there is Sofie Crisp, a young woman suffering from depression and some sort of fatigue syndrome that renders her unfit to live her life to the fullest. With Mumford's help, she begins her daily walks as she gains confidence and opens up to see what is out there.The film opens with a black and white sequence that is a fantasy being played in the mind of Henry. We realize it's only his mind wandering as he is not capable of doing what he dreams about. There is also the young millionaire who is one of the richest men in the country because his firm produces modems for computers and who doesn't care to show his eccentric side for all to see.Mumford's cover is finally revealed when an episode of the television program Unsolved Mysteries in which he is showcased. The town of Mumford, instead of condemning him, rallies in its support of a man that has done more in his humble way to help the community in spite of his deceit.Mumford is a delightful movie thanks to Loren Dean, who plays the title role. Mr. Dean does a wonderful work. Hope Davis is also a charming presence in the picture. The large supporting cast has some brilliant faces in it, Alfre Woodard, Jason Lee, Mary McDonnell, Pruitt Taylor Vance, Martin Short, Jane Adams, David Paymer, and Ted Danson, among them.The film's success belongs to Lawrence Kasdan whose brilliant take on a man who is a fake, but who has seen into the hearts of the people he has decided to settle in.

Loren Dean is not a well-known actor, but he should be...and he should get more work than he gets. His performance is flawless, although at times it seems that he lacks energy...but maybe that was the way Kasdan wrote the character. Jason Lee is at his usual best...just listening to that guy talk, I realize how perfect his diction is. He makes the most out of the funny dialogue. Alfre Woodard plays the town cafe owner, Lily -jeez, I wish *I* had a neighbor like her! A young Zooey Deschanel does great as the town's bad high school girl who Mumford sees pro bono (or as she says, pro boner?) If there is any weakness to Mumford, I'd have to say it comes from Hope Davis. Her early scenes with Loren Dean are good and convincing, but as the story progresses, it all just seems to slip. By the end, it's as if she's really forcing the dialogue badly. Martin Short, Dave Paymer, and the supporting cast are great (including Ted Danson playing a rich idiot and Jason Ritter playing the stepson who hates him). Dana Ivey, playing Hope Davis' mother, is so rotten you can almost smell her!

Also, as it is unethical for a therapist to romance a patient, what will happen to the brewing interest between the shrink and Sofie? This is a beautiful and enjoyable film that is most likely not extremely popular with the professional psychology crowd, as it ponders what is therapy and who is qualified to give counsel. But, what a delightful bunch of neurotic folks who inhabit the town of Mumford! They are brought to life wonderfully by the outstanding cast, every one of them, from Dean to Davis to Lee and all of the others. Then, also, the setting is extremely fetching, for the small city is located in a lovely valley. Add on nice costumes, an imaginative script, and a smooth direction and, folks, we have a winner here.

It has been years since the last viewing. It has held up very well; it is still a good movie. All of the criticisms about it in comments have been well-founded. It is slow-paced and even-paced. That is both good and bad. There was a preview for 'Gone in 60 Seconds' on the video tape that showed a frantic-paced movie that probably did better at the box office but I will bet was not as well written or as well-acted (Angelina Jolie is in 'Gone...', need I say more about the acting quality?) Pace may get your adrenaline flowing while your sitting in your seat but it doesn't do anything for your brain cells. Mumford engages you intellectually.It is challenging to the viewer to believe that a billionaire computer mogul - skateboarder can practically own a town and move about as freely and anonymously as he does in this movie. Jason Lee is just the person to have that role, though. He portrays the eternal adolescent in a lot of movies (it would be difficult to watch him play an assassin or a pederast; he picks the roles that he can handle and as a reward, he now anchors a very successful sitcom).The pace and some credibility issues aside, this movie is a pleasure to watch. Everything about the movie shares a harmony with its subject which is basically psychology. I read somewhere that Dr. Melfi (Lorraine Bracco) on the Sopranos was recommended to psychiatrists-in-training as the model for a focused listener, which is what a shrink is. Mickey Mumford (Loren Dean) is right up there with her as an exemplary professional when it comes to listening. In contrast, Dr. Melfi is even a little too tense and rigid (in keeping with her character, to Lorraine Bracco's credit as a fine actress). Mumford is simultaneously relaxed and alert; really, I could watch him sit still forever and be endlessly fascinated by the blink of his eyes (there is a scene where he acknowledges the sexiness of his young patient Nessa with the faintest of smiles and a slow blink; an absolutely stunning expression with almost no movement in his body language). I think I developed quite a crush on Loren Dean just watching him sit across from his patients. Because the character Mumford is so brilliant, he can be forgiven his few lapses in professionalism. When we first see Mary McDowell come into his office, he has just told Martin Short to leave his office and never come back. He is calm about it but he insists that he doesn't want to see him in his office again and Mary McDowell is witness to that speech. As he brings her into the office, he comments about Martin Short, 'Jeez, what an asshole!' and Mary McDowell laughs delightedly as we watch her back while she heads towards the couch. When he discusses his patients' problems with Jason Lee, making Lee feel uncomfortable, you sense that he's sharing his patients' dilemmas sympathetically, not revealing their weaknesses. If others don't see it that way, it is not his concern; he relates to people on a plane that doesn't share space with legal, professional ethics.Which is all the more surprising when you find out later in the movie about his background story.Every character (with Lily being the only possible exception) has a psychological profile that fits the story's needs and rings true. The underlying message might be, 'Everyone has problems; even your shrink has problems!' The movie never veers from that message. The feel-good addendum to that is 'And by sharing and exploring your problems, you can have a better life.' That is true about every single character.The way that Loren Dean sits in a chair, the way he listens, the intense but relaxed attitude he has while absorbing all the details of his clients - is inspiring. He has feelings, you never lose track of that fact, evidenced by his choice to suddenly shout at a patient when he thinks the patient's self-deception is so egregious that someone SHOULD shout at him.Lawrence Kasdan made a wonderful little film; much much better than any of his others (Grand Canyon and The Big Chill aren't half as nice).

Mr. Kasdan has done a good job as well, both as a director and as a writer.In the end it just gives you hope anyone can be fixed should people have the patience to listen to each other and be confident enough to spit their issues out.

It is a quiet, beautifully acted ensemble film that wears well indeed.Mumford (the underused Loren Dean) is a man with a variegated past who settles into a little town by the name of Mumford, decides he will listen to people talk, be a sounding board for folks who are in need of communication in this basically non-communicative world, and becomes a 'Psychologist' in every sense of the word - the good sense. The manner in which he listens to the many people within the little town is mesmerizing and insightful and the citizens he encounters and assists are varied and beautifully sculpted vulnerable human beings. The fine cast includes Hope Davis, Jason Lee (in one his finest roles), Mary McDonnell, Alfre Woodard, Zooey Deschanel, Martin Short, David Paymer, Kevin Tighe, Ted Danson, Jason Ritter and even more.The dialogue is introspective, healing, edgy, and entertaining and the overall feeling left with the viewer at the end of the piece is one of wishing more 'Mumfords' would be around our neighborhoods - or rather that we all could become 'Mumfords' with a little conviction and concern for our fellow beings. This is a Kasdan concept movie that touches our hearts while it stimulates our brains.

The other day I hit it fairly close to the beginning and decided to stick with it - and pay attention (not that it requires a great deal of attention to figure out what's going on). What struck me throughout was the lack of any real action (it's very much a character-driven story) which forces you to focus on what is being said. And you can't help but come away with the realization that the dialogue is extremely honest and well written.

Jason Lee, Mary McDonnell and Alfre Woodard are particularly effective.By virtue of the story, the central character would have be one of definite charisma. Kasdan opts for the little known Loren Dean who proves to have just the kind of quiet charisma and charm to make his character credible.Dean as yet, has not gone on to better things and Mumford seems to have made a lot less impact than it one would have expected.

Hollywood has exploited the small-town setting, but not here. Kasdan (the director) actually knows what it is to listen, to watch, and to be friendly. It's a comedy, but there's no punch lines to ruin the fun.The best part is that you like Dr. Mumford, just like everybody else does, and for the same reasons. This trick is accomplished honestly, because there's no put-on ironical distancing, like you often see with directors as sophisticated as Lawrence Kasdan. In no scene do you ever get the impression he is saying I am better than this; nowhere are you supposed to be entertained by any attitude in the script. It's just the people.I actually have the sneaky suspicion that Kasdan found his career challenged and rejuvenated by the success of his son's film, the excellent Zero Effect (from last year), there are echoes from that film in this one, common themes What is the meaning of the past?

Its subtle humor will be appreciated by those who enjoy watching people transform in much the same ways we do in real time.  This is a rare portrayal of the power of listening, a skill that I find is greatly lacking in our society and therefore is rarely shown on screen as a virtue. Loren Dean's Doc Mumford is compassionate, quiet, non-judgmental, humorous, low-key.  The audience sees his emotions that are, for the most part, hidden from his patients.  The supporting cast is composed of a large number of familiar faces -- strong and interesting character actors -- each one showing unique and non-stereotypical personalities.  I had to maneuver through my own reactions to the implausibility of the basic premise of the film.

Another volley of kudos should be mentioned towards Mumford's unifying theme of exceptance without question. Where else in recent cinematic memory have we had the likes of portly Pruitt Taylor Vince and the vivacious Mary McDonnell falling for each other while the Woodard/Lee angle thrives despite differences not only in race but in age too.

In fact the people of this little town are more or less like him. They all hide their truth, not avowing what they really want. This is a society that keeps itself behind masks; where everybody got used to wear, and nobody wants to take off to even know themselves.All the movie's factors (performance, cinematography, editing and music) are low-key. Here the deep sarcasm is mixed with a sense of tenderness attractively. The peak of both is in the scene in which the town's real psychiatrist feels great by talking to the town's unreal psychiatrist. Well, it's not only about how most doctors are blinded by making money more than seriously listening, but also it's about how not all the science is found in the books after all !There are no major problems I saw. Only a minor one about the fat pharmacist. I didn't wholly understand the character of that man. He lives many daydreams in a way separates him away from his reality. And he keeps dreaming of a hero that increases his incapacity compared to him.

Mumfordgently  gives us its insight into the very meaning of the word 'therapeutic', and allows us in the process to meet a delightful array of ordinary but meticulously drawn characters. By the end, 'Mumford' left this reviewer, at least, feeling refreshed and hopeful about the human condition.

So many movies, of all genres and types, come at the audience wielding sledgehammers and tongs that it is a rare treat to find a film as delicately lowkeyed and relaxed as Mumford, Lawrence Kasdan's quirky tale of a young psychologist named Mumford who sets up shop in a quaint rural town (also named Mumford) - described as Mayberry RFD by one of the least appetizing citizens therein - and who manages to brighten up the lives of the patients with whom he comes in contact.In terms of plot, the film is not overly original.  We have seen this tale before  an outsider, who may not be all he appears to be, suddenly arrives in town, gets people to face the realities of their existence, then finds the courage to admit his own failings with the supportive backing of the appreciative people he has helped.  Nothing really new here.  What is original, though, is the atmosphere of unhurried, bucolic charm that forms the backdrop for the enactment of the various humorous dramas that the writer/director unfolds before us.  The biggest temptation, in a comedy dealing with the eccentricities and neuroses of its many characters, would be to turn the people into overstated caricatures;  Kasdan has, however, managed to employ understatement throughout, even going so far as to have a number of the patients achieve their personal catharses and redemptions quite on their own, with Mumford's influence in that direction almost tangential at best.  What makes the mood of the film all of a piece is the fact that the characters problems never violate the tranquility of the town's placid atmosphere.  These are, essentially, decent, well-meaning people - and they are portrayed by a uniformly first rate cast - who have trouble accepting the secret but utterly normal impulses and desires that society forces most of us to deny.  The ease with which these characters ultimately attain emotional and psychological stasis would be offensive in a film dedicated to a serious study of the effect of psychoanalysis on a disturbed mind.  However, in the context of this almost otherworldly rustic environment - beautiful Sonoma County in Northern California serves as the setting - the film achieves the form of a fable.  The quiet, almost hushed tone, the unhurried pacing, the patiently observing camera all contribute to making Mumford a warm, wise and wonderful little charmer, a much needed tonic in a world of loud, lightning-paced cinematic extravaganzas.

Dean's undemonstrative performance is oddly suited to a movie that's clearly conservative, if not regressive, in its distrust of pace, ambition and big business (Ted Danson has a wonderful cameo as the embodiment of all these evils, and the movie's flashbacks to Dean's old life fleetingly adopt the style of something like Se7en).

The delinquent teenager (Zooey Deschanel) can't seem to keep a steady boyfriend.  And the town billionare (Jason Lee) can't seem to find a real friend.  But if anyone is really unique, it's the town's new psychiatrist, Dr. Mumford (Loren Dean).  You see, Dr. Mumford isn't really his name, and he really isn't a real psychiatrist. MUMFORD is the new comedy directed by Lawrence Kasdan, who's directed the good film titled GRAND CANYON, the underrated WYATT EARP, and the excellent western SILVERADO. Kasdan returns to comedy this time, and he does a pretty good job at it. The story has Dr. Mumford who is relied by many of the town's people to give them advice on their troubles.  However, Dr. Mumford has fallen in love with one of his patients (Hope Davis).   This is good for the doctor, since he really isn't a doctor, yet he's breaking the law for having people telling him their problems, and not being certified. I enjoyed the characters of MUMFORD, some of them were really engaging.  The two that grabbed my funny bone were the fascinating Skip Skipperton (Jason Lee), and the annoying jerk Lionel Dillard (Martin Short).  Martin Short is usually overlooked with his comedy talent (excpet by the Tony Award voters), and in MUMFORD, Short proves that he can be both funny and annoying.  As for Jason Lee, I'm waiting for a film of his own.  He was very funny and yet surprisingly gentle as the town's billionare.  What's also cool is that Lee gets to show off his original claim to fame, skateboarding, and he is still good at it. But I also liked the Mumford character by Loren Dean, his character has a compelling life story on what brings him to become the new psychiatrist of Mumford, and I'm sure that you probably won't forget it as well.  I would have really liked MUMFORD a lot if it came out last spring or this past summer. Unfortunately, I saw AMERICAN BEAUTY before I saw MUMFORD, and I thought AMERICAN BEAUTY's characters were extremely enthralling, while MUMFORD's characters were only good.

I remember it being a nice, even cute, film that was very enjoyable to spend an evening watching. And it was even more enjoyable the second time. Now I'm buying it. One of the big reasons this film stuck with me is the well-written script and its characters therein. They're very real, mainly because, well, they have problems. I like seeing that I'm not the only one with insecurities, fears, depression, etc. And I especially relate to the character played by Hope Davis. In another Lawrence Kasdan-directed film, French Kiss, I identify with Meg Ryan's character. She's inhibited, afraid of flying (that's me!!), and generally afraid to be brave. That's one of the reasons I enjoy watching THAT film as well, because of the fact that I relate to its central character. Something like that is very therapeutic to me. And that's appropriate, after all, because the film Mumford is about therapy. Watching it is a very therapeutic experience. It depicts real-life characters with real problems, and they get help. But the film also gets humor and enjoyment out of its eccentric characters, having fun with it and being able to step back, look at it, and even laugh. A very nice film. One of my favorite scenes is between Loren Dean and Hope Davis on the baseball field, while they're stretching, and Mumford explains about having two conflicting thoughts in your head, and how that can tear bits of your brain tissue apart. To this, Hope replies Well, then my whole life's been one big rip. What a profound scene for her. I wish I could see more films like this, meaning I wish they made more. It's profound, moving, relatable, funny, and simply a nice film.

Jason Lee (I) is hilarious as a hapless, mega-successful geek who hires Mumford simply to be his friend.  Dana Ivey as Mrs. Crisp and the underrated Hope Davis as her chronically fatigued daughter Sophie is a close reprisal of their roles in Stanley Tucci's 1998 The Impostors, (a faithful, madcap tribute to the Golden Age of Comedy which features the pair as the gold-digging Mrs. Essendine and her radically depressed daughter Emily).  Medically-knowledgeable viewers should be warned that the psychology of the movie is more for dramatic effect than accuracy, but those lacking a willing suspension of disbelief should be watching documentaries instead of comedies anyway.

Both Mumford and the muse were not what they appeared to be, but helped people anyway because the people just needed something to believe in.  Nothing about this film really overwhelmed me.  The characters were interesting and the script mildly funny.  It tried to be a comedy sometimes and a romance at others and it was mediocre in both regards.   It succeeded best as a character study of Mumford and his patients.Loren Dean was a bit too deadpan as Mumford, playing the part much more impassively than we would expect after we learn a little about his past.  Hope Davis was terrific as Sofie, the victim of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.  She looked so weak, frail and constantly out of breath, it was very difficult to tell that she wasn't really sick during the filming.  Jason Lee also gave a fine performance as Skip.

It is not a bad story either, but as a film I could have told you that this would not draw a big audience.  I could just see the script for this on my desk if I was a movie mogul.  I would read it and after I put it down I would have a slight, satisfied look on my face and I would politely tell Lawrence Kasdan that there was no way in hell that I would ever fund a film like this.  The reason is simple.  As fine as a story this is, there is nothing that makes it stand out.  It is slow, boring at times and even the characters are lazy.  This may be a good story but it just doesn't play out well on the big screen.  It isn't a biting social satire, it isn't a wickedly funny comedy, there is no steamy sex scene, it is more of a film that the makers of Leave It To Beaver would make.  And call me crazy, but I just don't think that translates well for a 90's crowd.  The way I look at it, most of your audience today is a younger crowd.  There will always be an audience for films like Apocolypse Now, Schindler's List and Life Is Beautiful, but they are abnormalities, or they are films that have great directors behind them so they automatically have an audience.  But with a film like Mumford, the previews really didn't look all that intriguing so that immediately takes away your high school crowd.  Your university crowd has similar tastes as the high school crowd but they need perhaps a bit more star power to get them in and perhaps that is why a film like American Beauty will destroy Mumford ( that and the fact that it is one of the best films ever made ).  So that leaves your adult audience.  And they already have other films to choose from that are getting much more praise and kudos than Mumford.  So the question is, where does this movie fit?  When do you release it and who is going to see it?  And those are tough answers, so maybe it shouldn't have been made into a film at all.  Maybe a stage play would have been better, and less expensive to make, and even though I have no idea how much this film cost to make, I would have to say that if it cost any more than 10 million, then it was a bad invesment by Disney.I think the cast in here was great.  I remember seeing Loren Dean in a small role in Apollo 13.  And even with a cast like Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, Tom Hanks and Kevin Bacon, he stood out.  He has a very natural acting style and you feel a familiar comfort with his characters.  He was very believable and enjoyable in here as well.  Jason Lee is my favourite character and I think he can steal a scene from anyone that he plays opposite with.  He has the two best lines in the film, the first being when he tells Mumford how much he is worth.  He tells him that he is worth 3 big ones.  And Mumford says  Wow that's great, I could work three life times and never make that much money. And then Lee says  No, I mean billion.  I'm worth 3 billion dollars.  He then turns and leaves for the bathroom.  And the other one is when he wonders if the patient that Doc has fallen in love with is him.  His delivery is perfect.  The script is fun and interesting but at times it is also just plain boring.  It's strange when you can watch a film and it enjoy it on many levels but then when it ends you are left to ponder if there isn't more to it.  That is exactly how I felt.  For a film to be not only entertaining, but first and foremost have any justifiation in getting made, it better have an edge to it.  It better be either, funny, scary, dramatic, tear jerking, uplifting or a combination of all of these.  To me the best films can combine most of these elements, take for instance the best film to come out this year, American Beauty.  Not only did it have all of these but it made you leave the theater thinking about it.  On the other end of the pendulum, when you leave the theater after watching this one, you won't remember much about it ten minutes later.  Is Mumford any good?  Sure, it's okay.  Is it worth seeing in the movie theater?  No, it is more like a story that is suitable for the stage.  Why the executives gave a film like this the green light is beyond me.  Maybe movie studios don't really care about losing money.  I don't know.  Maybe some day I'll be behind the desk when a script like this comes in and I'll give the green light and get chastised for it to.  But until that day, I get to have all the fun and let the Disney guys know that they are going to lose a pile of money on this one.

The characters were interesting, and the small-town ambiance was strangely comforting.I very much enjoyed Loren Dean's portrayal of the lead character, Mumford, a man masquerading as a professional psychologist.  His role required him to listen and react subtly and sympathetically to his patients, and the viewer must believe in people's propensity to confide in him to get through the movie at all.  He achieved this.  I imagine that this is a difficult acting task, to have to underplay yet seem completely real and plausible.  Mr. Dean held his emotions in, as he had to in his role as psychologist, but he revealed his real emotions to the audience with the smallest and subtlest of facial and body movements.Every other actor was also excellent, down to the smallest roles. Speaking of small roles (others here have covered the lead roles well, and I agree with them), Dana Ivey was wonderful as the chronic fatigue syndrome patient's hateful mother (Mrs. Crisp).  She was a horrible person, yet she never stooped to caricature; I believed that she was a real person.  She dominated every scene she was in.  Kevin Tighe as her husband, also was completely believable and likeable as the saint who stayed married to this person and kept his family together.I enjoyed watching these and other characters interact, and I enjoyed seeing how the screenplay worked out the inevitable unmasking of the imposter. However, after I got home and thought about the movie, I could only note the numerous plot items that were implausible, and in retrospect it diminished the movie in my mind. I got annoyed because it seemed that the screenwriter took the easy way out - I wished he'd have worked harder to come up with plausible solutions to his plot dilemmas. If I were to detail the implausibilities I found, it would get into spoilers.  But more than several attached to Mumford's past before he became an imposter, and to the means of his unmasking.I can recommend that people see this movie, because it is enjoyable and more interesting than the usual movie fare.

MUMFORD the character is a man sort of like THE GREAT IMPOSTER, a film that Tony Curtis starred in back in the 60's.  Like the Curtis character, he discovers during his stay at a monastery that he wants to have a new life, so he invents one. The update is that drugs have driven him to seek asylum with the good padres in the desert. While getting clean and sober he realizes that he is a good listener, so naturally he decides that he would make a wonderful therapist.  His training as an IRS agent, the life he left for drugs, shows him how to create the person known as Mumford, including all of the phony credentials that he needs to pass as a doctor. When he looks on a map and sees the town of Mumford, somewhere in idyllic, pastoral,  America, we are never sure just where, he thinks that's an omen, that's the place where I belong. The odd thing is, he does help people.  All of the folks he treats, get better from his listening and applying his very down to earth logical approach.

In any event, I recommend a pass on this one if you haven't seen it; don't waste your two hours.

The direction is the worst part of the movie.  Every line is telegraphed from miles away.  The couples that form at the end, no mystery.  Mumford's identity is going to be revealed on his favorite television show.  He's going to fall in love with...Skip this one and rent Doc Hollywood it's a much better version of the same movie.

Hope Springs was a stupid movie and so is this one. It is a waste of time to watch. The main character, Mumford, has moved to Mumford and is a psychiatrist. People are coming to him with their problems. Come to find out...he's not a psychiatrist. He is a former IRS employee who had a drug problem. The main character is bland and you cannot figure out why his patients are not really upset with him when they find out he is lying. Even his girlfriend just kind of goes well...ok. Also, you find out the backstory pretty early on when he tells it to one of his patients/friends who happens to be very rich and is building robotic sex girls. It's just ridiculous.

He regularly discusses patients--in great detail--with other patients.  For me, that was enough to make this into a horror film of the worst sort!  Why aren't all people involved in the psychiatric field, as professionals or as patients, boycotting this evil piece of nonsense??  It portrays incredibly unacceptable behavior as okay.  Get a clue, folks--this is really about serious invasions of privacy, about which there are already laws! "}]
