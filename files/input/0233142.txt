[{"Title":"Costner and Russells' Revenge","Date":"13 August 2001","Score":"76 out of 86 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":"  Scrolling through the 135+ comments, I'm amazed at how outraged so many viewers are at the excessive violence, explicit sex, foul language, etc., etc., etc.  C'mon.  A film is advertised as Elvises robbing a Las Vegas casino during an Elvis convention.  How much more lead in do you want?  You expect, action, thrills and ... content?  Amazing.  Listen.  This is one of the funniest, outrageous films I've seen in a long time. Yes.  The story's incredible.  But, in any film, we have to consider the level at which we're willing to buy in.  I mean, some people were outraged at the farting scenes in Shrek.  Now, they're complaining because Russell and Costner-- especially the latter-- are too violent.  Well, let's go back a year or so when Russell and Costner both made Wyatt Earp films, playing the title roles.  From my view, both vehicles were ghastly but entertaining.  So, I submit that what we have here is the COSTNER and RUSSELL Revenge vehicle.  Costner is always on the leafy edge, whether he's dancing with wolves, building baseball fields for ghosts or water-skiing as bait for sea monsters.  Russell, whose track record in shoot 'em-ups is no less than Stallone or Arnie, is likewise coming off some hound dog roles, such as being an automated soldier, a remake of his Escape from New York (LA?  Why'd anyone want to go there in the first place?) and the sci-fi Stargate.  Now, we get these two guys in a mindless, black comedy, full of S&V-- the most since the cult film Thursday-- with quirky twists and turns.  Mindless violence? Yes.  Gratuitious sex? Yes.  Entertaining?  Yes-- but only if you don't take it too seriously.  I loved it.

Film purest will classify this film as crap, and so it is; but this is crap that the masses want and the movie elite hates.  For action films this is great, a few slow parts, and the action scene at the end got a little predictable, with the high kill counts, but rebounds with a great ending.  An old western show down, and being a road movie it gives the junk food escapism I love and need.  The acting is great, Costner plays such a great jerk in this film, his attitude makes the viewer dislike him, like a bad guys in wrestling.  Costner should keep playing bad guys.

Judging from the television spots and theatrical trailers one would assume the film revolves around the slowly bubbling brewing plan to knock off a Vegas casino dressed as Elvises on International Elvis Night. But that is where you would be wrong. The ten minutes of nonstop action that are a result of the casino robbery (and in a weird dimension almost mirror the bank robbery scene in HEAT)happen in the first ten minutes of the movie; the other 120 minutes, revolve around the aftermath and repercussions of the bloodbath.Costner, who I swear to God will never do wrong in my eyes, does well for himself departing from the usual character and plays a bad guy. The great thing about this film is that all the characters are bad guys, we just have to decide how bad they are and how much we want to let ourselves care about them. Costner, is the baddest of them all, and eventually it becomes clear that the bad guy we are supposed to care about is the one played by the best Average Guy actor of all time---- Kurt Russell (remember BREAKDOWN?)In any case we have the romance, Courtney Cox and Russell. We have the bloody, cold hearted illegitimate (possibly) son of Elvis, Costner. We have the two cops chasing them, Kevin Pollack and Thomas Haden Church who compliment each other with wonderful chemistry. And we have the slew of supporting actors that plug up any possible holes the film might (but doesn't) have; Howie Long, David Arquette, Bokeem Woodbine (a Black Elvis), Ice-T, Christian Slater. Blah Blah Blah.This film on the whole becomes the first film in quite some time that I know I will see multiple times in the theater, and one that I am sure I will eventually know all the words to. Making it the fourth of the Costner Movies I can recite word for word (Robin Hood, Tin Cup, Postman)The relatively young director also made a unique decision in the editing of the film, allowing both of its stars, (Costner and Russell) cut their own version of the film. Costner's version concentrated more on the action, the blood, the guts, the death, the explosion, the F word with a strange annunciation of the G. And Russell's focused on the budding, and slowly blossoming love between Cox and himself. Costner's cut won, but I can't see anywhere that film lacks because of it. overall this is one of the most fully fleshed, well rounded films I have seen in quite a while.I loved it.A-  "},{"Title":"Excellent Action movie","Date":"21 August 2001","Score":"23 out of 32 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":"  Blah, Blah, Blah.

Unfortunately, that was the film's downfall as the dialog is either incredibly stupid and-or annoying in the second half of this movie. Most annoying was this young kid, you know - the smart-ass kind that says things NO kid his age would say in real life. He also had a foul mouth, and I don't like to see that from young kids.All the characters in here are pretty much low-life people, the worst being the one played by Kevin Costner, who seemed to relish this role.

"},{"Title":"flawed but somewhat interesting","Date":"4 August 2001","Score":"29 out of 45 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":"  `3000 Miles to Graceland' isn't quite as dopey as the cover art featuring Kurt Russell and Kevin Kostner clad in Elvis regalia would suggest.  Although it breaks little new ground in its already overworked genre, the film does emerge as an efficient crime drama thanks to a gallery of interesting characters, some impressive performances and Demian Lichtenstein's flashy directorial style.After a shaky first half hour or so, in which the film seems to be struggling to establish its direction and tone, the movie miraculously hits its stride and, thereafter, never really lets up.  The story centers around a band of ex-cons, united by their almost obsessive love for the King of rock'n'roll, who decide to knock over a Las Vegas casino dressed as Elvis impersonators.  Predictably, the heist serves merely as the pretext for one of them, the obviously psychotic Murphy (Kostner), to cold-bloodedly eliminate his accomplices.  The fly in his ointment turns out to be Michael Zane (Russell), the most principled one of the group, who survives the holocaust and spends his time, along with a pretty single mother and her precocious child, trying to keep out of Murphy's way.In terms of plotting, the film follows a pretty traditional route for this kind of film.  However, the characters here seem a bit more fleshed out than they often do in some of those other films, particularly Zane, who seems caught between his criminal inclinations and his innate goodness as a human being.  Cybil, the single mother played by Courteney Cox, likewise seems conflicted between genuine love and emotion and the excitement of easy wealth and a life lived on the edge.  But it is Kostner as Murphy who sets the real tone for the film.  His portrayal of a steely-eyed psychotic killer literally sets the teeth on edge, as he callously mows down scores of policemen and innocent bystanders who happen to get in his way.  He makes for a truly soul-cringing villain.  Russell, who played the actual legend back in his own younger, more halcyon days, makes a fascinating subtle counterpoint to Murphy's unbridled ruthlessness.The film is not, however, a total success.  For one thing, the violence often seems excessively brutal, graphic and mean spirited for a movie that seems to want to be a lark of sorts (after all, a movie featuring robbers dressed as Elvis impersonators can't be bidding to be taken too seriously).  Moreover, the plotting, which far too often relies on unlikely coincidences to keep it rolling, also borders frequently on the incoherent.  Finally, the morally ambiguous ending doesn't really sit well with those of us who find a couple of thieves, no matter how charming they may appear to be, unlikely candidates for heroism in the context of a `happy' ending.All in all, however, `3000 Miles to Graceland' will probably appeal to those who like their crime dramas offbeat, quirky and filled with interesting characters.

He is   an Elvis-loving criminal who robs a casino with his buddies and   proceeds with plans to annihilate them all before they can collect   their share of the loot. Simple set-up, heavy-handed execution.    The thing is, though, it works as mindless, forgettable trash. Director   Demian Lichtenstein is clearly churning out his Boys Own Gun Movie and   he does so with unapologetic enthusiasm and not a single concession to   political correctness. Which is refreshing.    As usual, Kurt Russell is fine as the guy Costner underestimates and   gets a world of trouble from. The climax is predictable, unfortunately,   and doesn't leave us with much to chew on, but the overwrought stylings   are the thing.    The shoot-outs are big and brassy, and there is much collateral damage   to be had. The Elvis angle is misleading because it suggests a lighter   movie in the Honeymoon in Vegas mold; but there is no lightness here,   just nihilism and firearm fetishism.

Rarely have I seen such a long, boring, mind-numbing mess. There's the germ of an offbeat idea--Elvis impersonators robbing a Vegas casino--but right from the start something's amiss, and the film only gets worse as it goes on. The first part is a mildly diverting heist picture, but it degenerates into a mindless road movie, making it clear that the filmmakers had no idea where to go. The third act is nearly unwatchable, and I felt tired and depressed when it was over. It would be hard to list every flaw in a single review, but the most prominent impression on my mind was that it's an assault on the senses. A handful of viewers liked it, but I don't envision this movie becoming a cult classic anytime soon. The director makes everything flashy looking, with rapid editing and tilted camera angles. He thought he was making the film exciting, but all it did was give me a headache. I am reminded of Armageddon, which had a similar problem but was at least a marginally more entertaining movie. Graceland isn't exciting, it's a poorly directed, sloppily written ordeal.I do not know how Kevin Costner was persuaded to appear in this travesty, except that perhaps he was tired of being the hero all the time. Well, if he wanted to play a villain, he got his wish. After watching the results, my guess is that he will stick with his more traditional roles from this day on. His approach to the character, a psychotic thug ringleader, doesn't have enough force or energy. It's clear that he didn't have any idea what to do with this nearly unplayable role, so he just faked it. On the other had, Kurt Russell does a fairly good job as his heart-of-gold partner, who eventually befriends a lonely single mother. I liked Courteney Cox's character, but her motivations are too vague for her actions to be credible. Does she love this guy or what? And does she so easily forget his threat to kill her? Likewise, David Kaye is reasonably good as Cox's son, but he's such a little brat. Christian Slater, Kevin Pollak, and David Arquette are utterly wasted and dispensed with early on. There should be a law against such misuse of resources.Demian Lichtenstein is one of the worst directors ever to helm a big-budget movie, and one hopes it will be a long time before anyone lets him near Hollywood again. Thankfully, his film was a miserable box-office bomb, so the worst of his legacy is probably over. According to the Internet Movie Database, he is better known for his rock videos, commercials, and short films. He should be forbidden from ever moving from that arena and inflicting more harm upon the moviegoing public. Who greenlit this thing? Who thought it would make a workable movie?

But you knew that.But if poorly written, it is pretty intelligently conceived. Think about the problem of the poor writer. Most film genres are going through a period of accelerated evolution. Copying old formulas in the sense of copying the essence of the whole film doesn't work anymore if a specific film hits, the studios copy it exactly as a `sequel' until it burns out.Tarrantino was the most self-promoting of a breed of `samplers,' who changed the game of formula. Samplers copy elements of prior films in an overtly self-referential way the quote is supposed to be obvious. The problem is not a lack of riches to quote, rather a challenge of novel composition.So the race for intelligent artifice is on. `Moulin Rouge' was a masterful combination of self-reference, satire and straightahead manipulation. Lots and lots of different solutions are appearing, many rather clever. So here we have a first time writer who starts from first principles what are the basics of artifice to build on?Elvis himself was a serial impersonator who spawned a whole cult of impersonators. So that's a possibly rich skeleton, especially if the director is someone from the music video world, which is nothing but cinematically-enhanced posturing of celebrities. Add in the familiar device of thieves who are constantly revealing their motives to have been impersonations. Add in Las Vegas, which has cinematically rich gaudy, fake frippery, and some balletic shootouts. Finally add in some Tarrantino insurance all the characters should be lowlifes.I think this could have been made to work. Parts of it have elsewhere. The lowlife transit of violence was painted well in `Kalifornia, ` even in `U Turn.' The choreographing of shootouts as an effect of random fate was recently done well in `Way of the Gun.' Elvis. Las Vegas, robber doublecrosses many times.So while this was a failure, and even though it had poor Kevin, it is an interesting failure.

This is filmmaking at its absolute worst; irresponsibility bordering on the contemptuous, for the stars and those of its intended audience intelligent enough to be outraged by it. If this is the best the creative team responsible for this dreck felt they could do, maybe they should all retire from the business. Like yesterday.Kurt Russell, who did a decent portrayal of Elvis in the TV biopic, nearly undoes all the good work he did before here.

Take it from those of us who've been watching you, Kev...we all like actors who stretch and take risks. It's generally conceded that you need a change of pace to revitalize your career, but bubby, THESE kind of changes you don't need.Maybe it's just me, but I thought I detected a few glimpses of near-embarassment from the supporting cast, regarding their brief appearances in this sorry excuse for an action film. Slater, Woodbine, Arquette, Cox, Jon Lovitz, Kevin Pollak and Thomas Haden Church are capable of doing much better work than this, and they have. They've also done some things I'm sure they've left off their resumes in recent times, but nothing THIS bad. Only Howie Long, taking a break from his Radio Shack commercials, seems to escape absolute shame in his brief cameo, and the young actor who plays Cox's juvenile brat of a son delivers what is possibly the best performance in this whole mess. As for Paul Anka...well, we'll give him the benefit of the doubt.Demian Lichtenstein is a former MTV video maven, and this shows in every frame. But does anyone have patience for an overlong music video masquerading as a sub-par action dramedy? If you seek to find the answer to that question, make sure that your local video store is running a two-fer special before you put this on the evening's itinerary.BTW, there are better action movies you could watch that are so over-the-top, they're damn near enjoyable. THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT and REMO WILLIAMS are two excellent examples. Or better still, go for Kurt one more time in the funky, junky, comic-book-extravagant BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA.

A low point for film, a low point for Costner (pretty incredible, considering some of the trash he's been in) and a low point for audiences.I'm not sure who to lash out against to begin - but I'll take my shots at director Demian Lichtenstein first, since he's the most obvious one to answer for this mess. The man may be a more than capable music video director, but he may want to stick to that particular genre if every effort of his on the big screen will look like this one. Excessive slow motion shots, random compressed footage and an eye that wanders so often as to make almost every scene difficult to watch don't add up to success. It's obvious that Lichtenstein was still thinking in 305 mode - the short-attention-span mode might appeal to 12-year-olds on sugar benders, but not too many others.Writing's next, since the plot, characters, storyline, etc. (i.e. every essential element) is a major weakness in this one. Why anyone would ruin what's a neat idea - Elvis impersonators shaking down a casino, an operation that takes about 5-10 minutes of screen time - with close to two hours of garbage is beyond me.What really bothers me is they missed out on the real story - the planning of this admittedly cool crime leading up to the actual event, where it doesn't matter if they succeed, but that they tried it - and went with something I can't even begin to describe.Sure, they were aiming for original and offbeat here, but wow did they miss the mark. We're not talking 4th ring outside the center, either - the target's in Central Park, and their shot landed somewhere in downtown... Siberia.There's no salvaging this wreck. Let's just pray it sinks deep beneath the waves - maybe somewhere in those vast oceans you might remember from Costner's bad but watchable Waterworld - and, unlike the Titanic, is never heard from again.

Absolutely retarded love interest element. Courtney Cox's character is so ridiculous it's irritating--she's supposed to be a catch (attractive, smart, caring, good, etc.), but she's actually the dumbest person alive. Her presence in the movie makes no sense, other than as a plot device, and her totally irrational and idiotic motivations do not enhance the story, instead they stick out like a big, stupid, sore thumb. 2. Equally demented kid interest element. Cox's character's kid is another unbelievably contrived bit that must have been thrown in as an interesting plot development, however he too is such an obvious cliche formula player that his existence just ends up as irritating. 3. Plot is lame. The only bits that create any storyline whatsoever are the injected relationship elements that are so absurd they shouldn't even be there in the first place. This movie has nothing remotely intelligent going on. 4. Main protagonist and antagonist are morons. Costner and Russell are maybe attempting to provide a realistic look at criminals in this movie, in which case their clumsy, simple-minded characters are well done. More likely however, is the possibility that the characters are supposed to be cool, in a pathological kind of way, and end up just looking like dolts. They seem smart enough to pull off a big casino robbery, but every other region of their brains seems badly atrophied. Go figure. 5. Truly senseless violence. This movie goes out of its way to see that as many cops as possible are killed in hails of gunfire. Police tactics here appear to be taken out of a cereal box prize container--how else to explain the cannon-fodderesque scene after scene, where a small number of gunmen manage to take out tens and tens of cops? It's a sad state of affairs when movies orchestrate events in order to have a shoot-out, just for the sake of killing people. Other good action movies do have violent shoot-outs, but they are usually more central to the plot, and we get a sense that they are necessary to our protagonist. In 3000 Miles, there is more of a sense that this is just a cool thing to do. Ugh.I could go on and on, refer to the Ice-T character, the duelling highway patrolman, etc., but a line must be drawn.I rated 3000 Miles a 3/10. I hated it enough to give it a one, but I must give credit for basic things like the fact is was on film, it had sound that lined up with the actors lips, the scenes were coherent (while still profoundly stupid), that kind of thing. I grudgingly gave it an extra point for the neat computer animation during the opening credits, the cool time lapse cinematography, and the somewhat interesting police characters of Church and Pollak. Much to little though, to make this anything but junk. "}{"Title":"Dreck.

At least that's what it's supposed to be. There are SO many plot holes, SO many inconsistencies, that it's truly an unwatchable film.Why, all of a sudden at the end of the film, are these criminals, who don't care for anything or anyone, suddenly concerned about the life of the boy? Why does Howie Long's character take the bullets meant for Kevin Costner? Why do we believe that Kurt Russell will soften his attitude towards Cox's character just because she starts crying? And where the HELL did they find a scorpion in the Pacific Northwest???The movie fails on so many levels. It makes the US Marshall's Service appear as idiots, It makes the criminals appear comedic - unintentionally so - especially when Ice T is travelling along a wire upside down, spinning, and firing dual submachine guns.It's a harsh thing to say, but I'm glad this movie lost money, to the tune of 47 million dollars. Perhaps Hollywood will realize that a movie needs a plot, a story, and dialogue that will attract the viewer. Just putting a bunch of shootouts in a movie will not attract moviegoers  (though I doubt it.)It appears that Kevin Costner needs to sit back, analyze his career, and decide what kind of scripts he fits as an actor. Every time he tries to stretch, he fails. Russell, well, for a long time now, he's just shown up, hit his mark, and taken his check home to Goldie.

It's at best a sloppy, thoroughly boring pseudo action-drama-comedy that destroys any interest or momentum it was building after the first half hour.Costner, Russell, Slater, David Arquette and Bokeem Woodbine star as a gang of hoods who dress up like Elvis to rob a Las Vegas casino during International Elvis week.  After the caper turns into a bloodbath (predictably), Costner decides to blow away the majority of the cast and it's up to he, Russell, and Courtney Cox as the requisite love interest and David Kaye as the requisite 10 year old to carry the picture into the depths of strangling boredom and mediocrity.With the Elvis premise, one would expect the gang of criminal Elvi to be sought after and be confused with other impersonators, but that's never the case.  Instead we are treated to the wooden acting of all the cast members, cliche after cliche evident in both action and movie-of-the-week plotting, and the grating, irritating penchant of music video director Lichtenstein to speed up, slow down, flash cut, and jerk the film around for no reason.  In a particularly excessive, laughable shot, he decides to film Russell and Cox parking at a motel in slow-motion with MTV style flashes of white to the an ear-scraping heavy metal soundtrack.With no plot to speak of, uniformly lazy performances by the entire cast, and atrocious pacing, editing, plotting, dialogue, and cinematography, one would at least expect 3000 Miles to have some slightly rousing good action sequences.

That's all.  Except it is a lot meaner, bloodier, and less stylish than the local Elvis impersonator. The best person possible to review this movie would have been Presley;  I'm sure he would have described it as mean-spirited, vicious, amoral and insulting to audiences, and an offense to his music, which was about love, feelings and tenderness; the opposite of what this movie is about.The movie begins with a gory robbery at a casino by thugs dressed as Elvis while there is a live Elvis stage show going on.   Lots of patrons are killed purposely during the robbery.  Minutes later, we are supposed to like these sociopathic Elvis impersonators.  Russell and Costner are among the killers, who soon turn out to be mortal enemies, both after the loot from the heist.The only remotely interesting character in the movie is Lovitt, who plays a money launderer who is holding the loot.  Eventually, Costner decides he wants it all for himself and catches up with him.After terrorizing Lovitt into opening the safe, Costner hangs around for no apparent reason for one of Lovitt's workers to show up, a young girl who doesn't have a clue as to what is happening.  Costner kills Lovitt and the girl (who he has never seen before) with hunting arrows, for absolutely no reason.   They are discovered dumped in the back bathroom in a pool of blood.  Again, we are supposed to find Costner charming after this. Costner simply doesn't play a convincing bad guy.   He does succeed at being repugnant, but what he doesn't seem to understand  is that what he is succeeding at is being repugnant in trying to play a bad character.After kidnapping Russell's girlfriend's son, Russell finally gets a brainwave and contacts the police, who send in the entire state militia to the warehouse the hostage transfer is to take place in.Russell double-crosses Costner (and endangers his girlfriend's son's life in the process) with newspaper clippings instead of money, and Costner shoots Russell with a gun the size of an anti-aircraft weapon.  Russell falls two or three floors to the ground inside the building.At the end of the film, Costner decides to go down in a blaze of glory by shooting dozens (literally dozens) of regular army commandos (!), their kevlar armor nothing compared to his suit of star protection, which shows that if you're the star, you can't be shot until the end of the film. The army commandos in this scene are worse shots than the Storm Troopers on Star Wars; with dozens of them blazing away with machine guns, they can't hit a single guy standing out in the open.  It's a good thing Iraq or Afghanistan didn't have this guy on their side; we never would have stood a chance. Oh, and he has help from Ice T playing a badass black mercenary (who acts like he is a leftover from 1960's blacksploitation pictures), who has a charming moment sliding across the ceiling on a rope (upside down, no less), spinning like an upside-down ballerina while killing endless army commandos. The movie has lost any semblance of coherency at this point, so why not? Russell's apparently dead body is put onto an ambulance.Finally, with the end credits getting ready to roll, Costner gets shot in the leg, and kills lots more commandos;  seeing what he has become in a mirror, he then allows himself to be riddled by the commandos' bullets.But wait, Russell is alive!  He cleverly was wearing a kevlar vest, the only one working in this film.  And guess who is driving the ambulance?  His girlfriend!   The ambulance driver and paramedics had apparently gone out for a smoke during the carnage, leaving the vehicle unattended (which never happens under any circumstances in real life).  The driver comes back and asks casually, where's my ambulance?, which sums up the intelligence of the entire picture.At the end of the film, Russell, his girlfriend and son are on a newly-bought boat out on a day cruise, proving that crime pays, and pays big.    The End.    But not quiteWhile the credits are rolling, the editor's give the viewers something to look at, a disturbed MTV-like video playing on the left side of the screen, with Russell doing an Elvis imitation intercut with Costner playing with two guns, trying to decide which one to use, and finally pointing one at the audience.   Costner is trying to look stylish and cute, but considering the dozens of people his character has murdered, it looks as warm and cuddly as if Son of Sam had been paroled and was doing an Elvis impersonation, aiming his gun at the audience.  Strangely enough, this five minute video is a condensation of the entire plot of the movie, and exactly as coherent.Looking back it at, this video could have been done at the request of the film crew,  to distract the audience from looking at the titles and seeing their name connected to this film.If I had spent $9 for this movie at the theater, I probably would have been moved to acts of barbarity like those I witnessed in the film.

Films such as 3000 Miles To Graceland make me question the screenwriters ability to come up with an entertaining script. Two hours of non-stop gratuitous action and four high profile actors cannot make up for the lacking elements of 3000 Miles To Graceland. This film fails to reach the potential it had with the original concept.There is nothing new about 3000 Miles To Graceland because a similar plot was created to entertain audiences a year earlier called Reindeer Games. Since I enjoyed Reindeer Games, I thought I would enjoy this film; however, I was sorely disappointed to learn that this movie was nothing more than four men with a desire to play dress up in Elvis costumes. If I wanted to see Elvis impersonators, I would travel to Memphis and take part in the Elvis convention.The biggest problem I found with 3000 Miles To Graceland was understanding the reason why this film was made. Four men parading around in Elvis costumes is so uninteresting I felt like walking out of the theater and asking for my money back; something I rarely find myself doing. Another problem I had was the lack of focus and commitment showed by the actors. With each passing scene, it became painfully obvious that the actors were more interested in the concept of prancing around in costumes playing cowboys and indians.Though there was a plot somewhere scattered among this mess; however, I failed to see the connection and relevance of most of the scenes. The scenes seemed to be slapped together and forced for the purpose of making another Elvis film. The writers must have had their minds on other topics because their effort certainly showed in the outcome. Zero plot, zero effort and zero character development totals a really bad written film. If I had a nickel each time I pointed out an irrelevant scene, the bank would go broke and I would be a rich man.Costner has been one of my favorite actors since I was a kid. Field Of Dreams marked the first time I saw this tremendous talent at work and I knew he had the ability to draw the audience into the film. With a roller coaster career that includes box office failures such as Waterworld and successes such as Dances With Wolves, Costner has proven he is only human. Watching Costner perform in 3000 Miles To Graceland was terrible because he put no effort into trying to make his character come alive. I look forward to the next Costner film because it is sure to be a hit.Russell has always been actor one can always count on to deliver powerful and comedic performances; however, he takes a nosedive with his worst film since Soldier. Like Costner, I sat through 3000 Miles To Graceland watching Russell perform in a flat and extremely one-dimensional role. It hurts to see an actor who has had a successful movie career make a huge mistake choosing to make this movie. I could only wish and hope he can rebound from this movie and get on track once again.I would like to talk about the supporting cast; however, there performances were so awful it doesn't deserve any comment. Cox was out of her element and should return to sitcom fame; Slater should make wise decisions regarding which roles to take.3000 Miles To Graceland is far from its destination and drives itself into the ground as it strives to entertain viewers. Even with the firepower of Kevin Costner and Kurt Russell, 3000 Miles To Graceland could not overcome its over-glorification of Elvis Presley; two thumbs way down. Along with films such as All The Pretty Horses, Battlefield Earth, Soldier and Freddy Got Fingered; 3000 Miles To Graceland belongs in a graveyard containing films that should never be seen again.

If he were alive, he would have come out of hiding to file a liable suit.SPOILERS AHEADThis film is a simple bloody heist/revenge picture with the gimmick of having the characters dress like Elvis.  That's all.  Except it is a lot meaner, bloodier, and less stylish than the local Elvis impersonator. The best person possible to review this movie would have been Presley;  I'm sure he would have described it as mean-spirited, vicious, amoral and insulting to audiences, and an offense to his music, which was about love, feelings and tenderness; the opposite of what this movie is about.The movie begins with a gory robbery at a casino by thugs dressed as Elvis while there is a live Elvis stage show going on.   Lots of patrons are killed purposely during the robbery.  Minutes later, we are supposed to like these sociopathic Elvis impersonators.  Russell and Costner are among the killers, who soon turn out to be mortal enemies, both after the loot from the heist.The only remotely interesting character in the movie is Lovitt, who plays a money launderer who is holding the loot.  Eventually, Costner decides he wants it all for himself and catches up with him.After terrorizing Lovitt into opening the safe, Costner hangs around for no apparent reason for one of Lovitt's workers to show up, a young girl who doesn't have a clue as to what is happening.  Costner kills Lovitt and the girl (who he has never seen before) with hunting arrows, for absolutely no reason.   They are discovered dumped in the back bathroom in a pool of blood.  Again, we are supposed to find Costner charming after this. Costner simply doesn't play a convincing bad guy.   He does succeed at being repugnant, but what he doesn't seem to understand  is that what he is succeeding at is being repugnant himself in trying to play a bad character.After kidnapping Russell's girlfriend's son, Russell finally gets a brainwave and contacts the police, who send in the entire state militia to the warehouse the hostage transfer is to take place in.Russell double-crosses Costner (and endangers his girlfriend's son's life in the process) with newspaper clippings instead of money, and Costner shoots Russell with a gun the size of an anti-aircraft weapon.  Russell falls two or three floors to the ground inside the building.At the end of the film, Costner decides to go down in a blaze of glory by shooting dozens (literally dozens) of regular army commandos (!), their kevlar armor nothing compared to his suit of star protection, which shows that if you're the star, you can't be shot until the end of the film. The army commandos in this scene are worse shots than the Storm Troopers on Star Wars; with dozens of them blazing away with machine guns, they can't hit a single guy standing out in the open.  It's a good thing Iraq or Afghanistan didn't have this guy on their side; we never would have stood a chance. Oh, and he has help from Ice T playing a badass black mercenary (who acts like he is a leftover from 1960's blacksploitation pictures), who has a charming moment sliding across the ceiling on a rope (upside down, no less), spinning like an upside-down ballerina while killing endless army commandos. The movie has lost any semblance of coherency at this point, so why not? Russell's apparently dead body is put onto an ambulance.Finally, with the end credits getting ready to roll, Costner gets shot in the leg, and kills lots more commandos;  seeing what he has become in a mirror, he then allows himself to be riddled by the commandos' bullets.But wait, Russell is alive!  He cleverly was wearing a kevlar vest, the only one working in this film.  And guess who is driving the ambulance?  His girlfriend!   The ambulance driver and paramedics had apparently gone out for a smoke during the carnage, leaving the vehicle unattended (which never happens under any circumstances in real life).  The driver comes back and asks casually, where's my ambulance?, which sums up the intelligence of the entire picture.At the end of the film, Russell, his girlfriend and son are on a newly-bought boat out on a day cruise, proving that crime pays, and pays big.    The End.    But not quiteWhile the credits are rolling, the editor's give the viewers something to look at, a disturbed MTV-like video playing on the left side of the screen, with Russell doing an Elvis imitation intercut with Costner playing with two guns, trying to decide which one to use, and finally pointing one at the audience.   Costner is trying to look stylish and cute, but considering the dozens of people his character has murdered, it looks as warm and cuddly as if Son of Sam had been paroled and was doing an Elvis impersonation, aiming his gun at the audience.  Strangely enough, this five minute video is a condensation of the entire plot of the movie, and exactly as coherent.Looking back it at, this video could have been done at the request of the film crew,  to distract the audience from looking at the titles and seeing their name connected to this film.If I had spent $9 for this movie at the theater, I probably would have been moved to acts of barbarity like those I witnessed in the film.   If you don't believe a movie with Russell and Costner can be this bad, go check it out at Blockbuster.   I dare you.  Don't say you weren't warned. If they make a sequel called 3000 Miles to Burning the Original Print of Graceland, they would guarantee the blockbuster of the year.In honor of the sum of the collective I.Q.s of the director, writer and producer, I am giving this three stars.

In any other year, 3000 Miles might have been a favorite; it's the poor film's luck that it came out at a great time for terrible movies.  But don't forget this dark horse Razzie voters, this movie has the goods; er, bads.I'd like to pinpoint where this movie went wrong, but in this case it seems difficult to find a way in which the film could have gone right.  From the opening credits we're heavy into oddball territory, as a film about Elvis-impersonating gangsters opens with a lengthy (and highly inauthentic) battle between two CGI scorpions.  Clearly director Demian Lichtenstein is trying to suggest something about super-mean character Murphy, played by a mutton-chopped Kevin Costner.  Murphy, coincidentally, has a scorpion tattoo and a scorpion belt.  He likes scorpions a whole lot.His nemesis in this thing is Michael Zane, another Elvis impersonating criminal, played by Kurt Russell.  Along with a team of additional King impersonators (Including David Arquette and Christian Slater), they rob a Vegas casino about a half hour into in the picture, and spend the remaining ninety minutes following each other around trying to secure the loot. Courteney Cox plays requisite love interest Cybil (with a `c'), and her young child/annoying sidekick is perhaps the most irksome movie tyke since Thomas Ian Nicholas in A Kid In King Arthur's Court.It's curious that the movie sets up the Elvis bank robbers, and odd and intriguing premise, only to have the robbery play out completely in Act I, so the rest of the movie is a series of typical (and bad) gangster chases and double-crosses, except all the characters have sideburns and sequins (Note The longer your sideburns in this movie, the more dangerous you are). Lichtenstein and co-writer Richard Recco don't have a firm grip here; is this a goofy heist flick?  A gritty Tarantino-esque neo-noir?  A road trip love story?  I wish I could have heard this movie's pitch.  `Well, it's Reservoir Dogs meets Honeymoon in Vegas meets Dutch.'  A winning pedigree like that; it's shocking this thing went wrong.Among the most glaring omissions in the film is the lack of character motivation.  We know Costner's Murphy is real evil; cause he kills people but especially because he smokes indoors while wearing sunglasses.  But why is he so gosh-darn angry?  The movie doesn't have time bother with a reason, it's too busy finding spaces for disappointing cameos from Jon Lovitz and Ice T (whose last appearance on screen will get a huge unintentional laugh even from the film's most ardent supporters).  Say this about the movie; Howie Long doesn't have to say Firestorm is the worst movie he's been in any more.  Congrats Howie.The movie drags so long they might as well have called it 3000 Minutes to Graceland.  I saw  it on television, and I still want my money back.  The film closes with a protracted and unsuspenseful orgy of gunfire, after which FBI agent Kevin Pollack tells his men `Go make sure everyone's ok.'  At that point, you hope he's sending someone out to check on the audience and make sure they are still breathing too.

What a surprise! What I finally saw is one of the best action movies I've seen in a long time. It even has a plot you can follow, doesn't need bloody guts and severed body parts to be shown in close-up. It is just a film about bank robbers, that decided to rob a casino, because everybody else robs banks. There is a huge shootout and security guards and innocent bystanders drop dead by the dozen. The rivalry between the robbers evolves and finally leads (through some twists)to the showdown between Costner / Russell / dozens of law enforcers. The way Costner portraits the lunatic (actually believing himself to be one of Elvis' illegitimate children)is just fantastic and worth watching the movie. Russell is also wonderful to watch, as the ex-con who just wants to get enough money to settle down on his boat (nice twist there)and who doesn't share the enthusiasm of the others for killing. Even Cox as the woman in the middle shows a surprisingly good performance. Admittedly, you don't have to switch on your brain to understand it, but it is really cool to watch, funny and entertaining.

It was similar to other robbery movies I have seen, but it was entertaining. It kept me glued to the screen. What I liked most about it was, you could not trust anyone... just when you think you trust a character, they do something that you don't really expect. I don't want to rip off a famous saying from a classic TV show... but in this case this phrase is true... Trust no-one!The casting was not great... there were some great choices, but also some mistakes. Kurt Russell is the main character. He did a fantastic job. I think he is such a great actor. He has made so many classic films. But he will never beat Big Trouble in Little China in my opinion. I love that movie. Kevin Costner is the other main character. This was a bad choice. Kevin has always been a very hit and miss actor for me. He has made some great movies and he clearly can act... but in some movies the characters just do not suit his style of acting. Unfortunately, this is one of those characters. Half of the movie he did well. He was believable in his role, but then there would be quite a few scenes where he seemed very out of place and you could tell he was acting... badly. Courtney Cox was also cast in this movie... she was a great choice. She made this just after Scream 3 and whilst she was in the middle of filming Friends. She is a good actress, and she has proved she can play straight roles as well as comedy. This was a very good performance from her. Other cast members were David Arquette, Christian Slater, Kevin Pollak & Jon Lovitz. There was also a little cameo by Ice-T... but this was another mistake. This role was not good for him. I don't really rate him as an actor anyway, but this is a film he should have stayed away from.The movie had a few comedy moments in there, but they were not laugh out loud funny. There was scene in particular which was just out of place. It did not belong in the film because it was just silly. Kevin Costner pretended to be a baseball fan... but he was dressed in this stupid costume which just didn't fit in the film at all.I will give this film 7 out of 10.Entertaining, unpredictable and fun.

At the end of the movie Kurt Russel is wounded in a shoot out and pulled out of a werehouse.  everybody knows hes not a cop, and it is unlikly that he works for the werehouse.  but the police say that everyone involved the the robbery is dead?  and the money will never be recovered? i think in the real world kurt would have been gaurded.  or at least an eye kept on him.

Courtney Cox did an OK job as the trashy, underwear-showing Single Mom. David Kaye as her Klepto kid was particularly refreshing.

It's got all the required elements gratuitous shots of hot chick's rear end, non-stop formulaic pop-rock, fast music video-style editing, guns standing in for feelings of penile inadequacy, campy Las Vegas glitz, and let's not forget the subtle inclusion of an Elvis-impersonating little person.

The filmmakers are pretty much using all the right marketing buttons to grab their audience's attention&#133; but there's nothing more than a base-level concept of cool. Hot chicks in tight clothes? Bring 'em on so long as they're smart and/or cunning. But a clingy, emotionally-imbalanced, DUMB hot chick is about the most unsexy thing in the world. Rock music? The basic rule-of-thumb is that if it gets radio air time in the Midwest, it's probably not really that great. Video-style editing? There are some beautiful montages of the Vegas lights, but this technique is over used and the triteness of the movie belittles its effect. Guns and excessive violence?  When they're used strategically and in an unexpected way, the effect can be really powerful. Here it's just boring. Camp? Honey, camp doesn't work when you take yourself so seriously.

Michael, the good bad guy played by Kurt Russell, endeavors to avoid shooting police officers (in one scene, he shoots out overhead lights to pelt the police with distracting bits of glass and phosphorus).  Of course, he is traveling with a bunch of people who have no compunction about killing people in uniform. Predictably for movies of this sort, the police have abysmal marksmanship skills.  At times, I found myself rooting for the good guys  c'mon, hit one of the bad guys already!The core of the story is about the romance between Courtney Cox's character and Kurt Russell's character.  She also has an adorable kleptomaniac son. It becomes obvious after a little while that all of the principles in this story belong in institutions.  I know, this misses the intended romance of the entire situation.  We are supposed to believe, for purposes of this story, that a few million dollars can redeem anyone's sins.In my opinion, 3,000 Miles to Graceland tries to be about flawed characters, avarice and eventual redemption.  What we get is psychopaths dressed as Elvis.  I can appreciate a black comedy where bad is good and good is bad. I can appreciate a story where a bad man learns to change his ways and encourage his new-found stepson to be a good person.  I don't think it works when both these themes are stuck in the same movie.  And the Murphy-Elvis sub-theme is tacked on like a lawn chair taped to a roof of a pick-up truck.Other petty quibbles with the movieThere is not enough gore in the movie.  Many people are shot at close range, yet we see no brains or other parts splattered about--just catshup.In the final scene of the gunfight, Murphy has no fewer that the six aiming lasers painted on his chest.  When he lifts his weapon, his chest should have basically imploded as thirty or so NATO rounds hit their mark.Again, the police marksmanship.  In New York City, assailants will end up with a dozen slugs or more in them for even appearing to threaten police. Apparently, the Las Vegas police don't practice.

Since I enjoyed Reindeer Games, I thought I would enjoy this film; however, I was sorely disappointed to learn that this movie was nothing more than four men with a desire to play dress up in Elvis costumes.The first and biggest problem I found with 3000 Miles To Graceland was understanding the reason why this film was made.

Many scenes seemed to be slapped together and forced for the purpose of making another Elvis film.The next problem I had with this film was 3000 Miles To Graceland was an excuse for four friends to come together and parade around in Elvis costumes in the guise of making a film; however, they failed to realize audiences were going to see this film.Even with the firepower of Kevin Costner and Kurt Russell, 3000 Miles To Graceland  could not overcome its over-glorification of Elvis Presley.

The choice feels completely arbitrary as only the most obvious Elvis references are made.But arbitrary must be writer/director Demian Lichtenstein's middle name. With most of his experience in music videos, Lichtenstein doesn't seem to know what to do with anything outside a three-minute format. His use of different film stock, ala Stone's Natural Born Killers, serves no purpose.Not that it matters, of course, since the script takes a good concept and drives it off a cliff within the first couple of minutes. The plot's indecisiveness ruins any and all threads that, if followed individually, might have saved this ill-measured mix of heist-road trip-action-comedy.As for the cast, Arquette is determined to typecast himself as the wacky 1-800-call-att guy and Slater continues to impersonate Jack Nicholson impersonation. And Costner still delievers his lines as if reading from a teleprompter. But blaming Costner would be like blaming a 2x4. Sure, it doesn't help the film, but it doesn't really harm it a whole lot either. Russell (It Happened at the World's Fair) actually does as well as he can with such a inscrutable film.As if all this were not enough, the score is awful. It's as if the filmmakers made a point of including as little Elvis music as possible. Just because it's been done before doesn't mean it won't work again. Elvis was a singer with an ample catalog of songs.

It has a lot of cool effects and great action sequences, and a relatively decent storyline, though ridiculous in many ways. One other thing I have good to say about it is that it has some pretty good cinematography, not always, but often. With an all star cast like they have (personally I love Costner's character) its hard not give it a chance and I think it deserves people watching it, at least fans of action films.On the other hand, the film is actually pretty terrible. Very bad acting by most of the cast, and a lot of generic and stupid dialog. As I mentioned, it does have a good root idea for the storyline. However, trying to be cool, and more action packed weakened the plot and made the film get worse as it progresses. Top all this off with an obvious and yet unfitting ending and you have 3000 Miles to Graceland.I think a lot of people will like this film if they are going into it looking for a hardcore action film and not looking for an overall good film.

In 1954, expressive Johnnie Ray's version was considered too sexually suggestive for US radio. Presley's music mixes well with the modern score.The film is senseless. There are a lot of Elvis references, mostly centered around Russell. He appeared as a kid extra in It Happened at the World's Fair (1963), which is acknowledged when Russell gets kicked by kid Kaye. Also, in an elevator, Russell is asked to autograph an LP soundtrack from the old film. Russell occasionally uses some Presley postures, mannerisms, and talk (man, watch the hair). He wears a TCB (Taking Care of Business) necklace with the Captain Marvel Jr. lightning bolt, and he digitally puffs the darker cigarettes Presley smoked. Costner's character is more original and interesting, but unfortunately less developed.***** 3000 Miles to Graceland (2/20/01) Demian Lichtenstein ~ Kurt Russell, Kevin Costner, Courteney Cox, David Kaye "},{"Title":"Good","Date":"19 February 2010","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":" Costner is King!, 27 February 2001 Author Queequegfilms Great, great action movie, I would not want the release date of this movie, not newer, had infected the trial, the scenery is excellent and the Pima Kostner time Kevin is playing the role of bad guy evil and gays.

"}{"Title":"Silly and incidental with dumb logic at times but it remains big on energy and doesn't make you want to switch it off before its conclusion.","Date":"31 January 2008","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":" I think 3000 Miles to Graceland is a really good example of an incidence where a film really wants to put the emphasis on the visual over everything else, but in a silly and brainless way rather than a constructive one. The film contains numerous incidences in which the events that transpire are either unrealistic, unimaginative or ridiculous in their respective concepts. 3000 Miles to Graceland is a film that cross contaminates genres, uses its characters in a silly and contradictory manner and feels the need to blast us with dumb action when it thinks we might be getting bored.I've always thought that Christian Slater has had one of the worst agents a film star could ever have. His career has been so up and down, playing odd roles in obscure films that you would think he was better than; whilst seemingly trying to adapt to the comedy genre more than anything else. Here, he is reunited with Kevin Costner after a ten year gap between Robin Hood Prince of Thieves and this and he makes up a band of crooks also consisting of Kurt Russell and David Arquette. The film's most impressive sequence or chain of events occur in its opening twenty five to thirty minutes, the exact time it takes for a film to 'set the scene' so to speak. After some introduction of the characters, an interesting scene happens in the car on the way to the Casino they will rob Thomas Murphy (Costner) orders out an African American member of their gang to let Michael Zane (Russell) sit in the front with him. From here, the emphasis is on the two riding in the front; the three in the back joke and mess around; cracking jokes and generally being a nuisance. Costner has already established authority in the gang by ordering out a fellow member and it's here that the two in the front seats are established as adults whilst three in the back more resemble children with their foolery. At one point, Arquette's character cracks a joke that forces Costner's character to actually stop the car, turn around and give him an ear full &#150; as if an adult were lecturing a child. This not only creates tension early on but establishes Murphy as a figure of authority or someone not to be tangled with therefore it is no surprise the person sitting next to Murphy is Kurt Russell's character, Zane; whom the film will revolve around in due course.When they arrive at the casino, the film moves up another gear and gives us a great shootout in which these men rob the casino's fault. Zane says that everyone robs banks these days but nobody expects a Casino to get ripped off; further emphasising the Reservoir Dogs mentality that banks are a clichéd thing to rob (remember they went to a jewellers). During this scene, we get a lot of good choreographing and some decent violence. Even in its best scene, the film still suffers the security guards are pathetically weak bodied foils and the African American character is rather ashamedly the only one to die; his body tossed away after futile attempts to save him. During the film at that point, I thought the death may be a large spoiler but given the route the film goes down following the robbery, it is a highly insignificant incident.What follows is a film that really wants to be Reservoir Dogs with a touch of the buddy film formula before settling on a road movie route. This is twinned with seemingly pointless scenes that cut back to two highly ranked lawmen who look bored and uninterested in their work and are there to merely crack one-liners between the two of them. The film then struggles with its logic and incident in such a clumsy manner that it comes close to detaching its characters from entirely being human beings. Slater's character demands the dead man's cut and when tensions rise, things happen. It is here that I was unclear if Murphy's ideas to do what he did was a direct result of Slater's actions in wanting to keep the cut OR if Murphy had it planned the whole time to do what he did. If he did have it planned the whole time, why was Zane not properly finished off following being incapacitated? The other inconsistency which is directly the source of the films love story comes in the form of Courtney Cox's character Cybil Waingrow. Waingrow comes a cross as a bit of a loose woman given the fact she has a son; no husband; wears revealing outfits; clothes too small for her and sleeps with a guy within an hour of knowing him. Here, she leaves her son with Zane to go off chasing money she doesn't even know she'll get. Later the script embarrassingly puts it down to because she really trusts and loves Zane which was unconvincing and felt artificial. The kid in question is Jesse (Kaye) who punches way above his weight in terms of dialogue and persona, acting like someone twenty years his elder in a rather embarrassing manner; not embarrassing because of poor acting but due to poor characterisation. There is also the question raised conforming to why Zane doesn't ditch the kid in the first place; seemingly because he needs him Jesse works out to report the car stolen, bringing both Zane and Murphy together in a jail; Murphy then being able to call in a helicopter and to set up the film's climax before we're anywhere near it. This film may use up all its sense and suspense early on but it keeps up its energy rate. However, a lagging script and a finale straight out of a Segal/van Damme film really leaves a nasty taste in the mouth with a feeling that although Russell and Costner do well with what they've got; they deserve a bit better than this.

The screenplay for this mindless mayhem is horrendous, and one can only wonder what kind of blackmail was used to get Costner and Russell to agree to appear.  The story isn't just weak, it is absurd.   The dialogue is nauseatingly bad.  Most B movie producers would have burned this script after reading about five pages.  How it managed to procure a $62 million budget is a wonder of modern filmmaking.Writer/Director/Producer Demian Lichtenstein seems so intent on presenting graphically violent images without regard to plausibility that he completely incinerates any vestige of credibility the screenplay might have contained.  Lichtenstein shows promise with some effective camera work and generally good cinematography, but these skills without the slightest understanding of storytelling technique, continuity and actor direction make him better suited to be shooting commercials.  The music by George Clinton is awful, again below B movie standards.The acting is mediocre, although even brilliant performances would have been wasted on this script.  Kevin Costner, a paragon of good guy roles, attempts to play a badder-than-bad super sociopath, and while it is a decent performance, the character is so one dimensional that it allows for no nuance.  This combined with Costner's having to force himself to overcome his naturally nice demeanor makes the character extremely unbelievable.Kurt Russell doesn't fare much better.  He does his best to portray his character as a hard boiled criminal with a soft heart, but comes off as too much of a sap, doing obviously stupid things repeatedly because he can't resist the charms of the scheming Cybil (Courtney Cox) and her underhanded kid (David Kaye).  Christian Slater, David Arquette, Jon Lovitz, and Ice-T are thrown in just to beef up the celebrity body count.This film is a dreadfully violent massacre of celluloid, with a story so brainless and unbelievable that it insults all but the most Neanderthal of viewers.

He knew how to have fun with the movie!I'm proud to have 3000 Miles as part of my DVD collection, because it's one of those great guilty-pleasure popcorn flicks.  You can attack it on so many levels, artistically.  Its director, Demian Lichtenstein, is a first-time director, only having directed music videos in the past.  So the whole film plays out like a music video, with nonstop use of quick cutting.  But in a bizarre way it works, considering the film's lightning-fast pace.  The story at times makes no sense.  The music (going back to the director's history in making videos) seems to upstage the action in many circumstances.  Nevertheless, I love the music in this movie, whether or not the songs fit the tone of each scene.  Yes, Kevin Costner's performance is overstated, to say the least.  Who cares?  This ain't Remains of the Day.  This is a comic-book-style action movie meant to entertain and entertain only.  His character is almost like a comic book villain.  He's not meant to have a human side.  And Costner's performance was perfect in the context of the character, and he seemed to be having tons of fun.  When you have the joy of performance, you don't need much else.  I always love seeing Kurt Russell.  The rest of the actors, except for Kevin Pollak and Thomas Haden-Church, give decent but throwaway performances.  One complaint about this movie was the endangering of children during several scenes.  There's one thing people forgot to throw in  Kevin Costner's THE VILLAIN!  His violence against children works within the context of the character; it's not in any way exploiting it.  If that's the case, we can blame The Silence of the Lambs for exploiting cannabilism.  Admittedly, Costner's character did have some cool elements to him, but not in a way that you want to be just like him and start hurting children. There's some real cool lines of dialogue, which I enjoy reciting on a regular basis.  Overall, it's not an art film by any means, but it makes damn fine entertainment!

Kevin Costner is in my top 5 actors of all time (ranked third). and the soundtrack made up almost entirely of Elvis Presley tracks is superb. Costner is currently enjoying an Indian summer of stardom thanks to his much praised role in the history channels Hatfield & McCoys and supporting roles in Man Of Steel and Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit before leading roles in 3 Days To Kill and Draft Day. He is always reliable, but here he is truly awesome. Overall the movie is silly, but I enjoyed a lot of it. The likable cast is headed by good old KC, Kurt Russell (always a good Elvis) Courtney Cox (in a career low performance, with awful accent to boot) her former husband David Arquette, Christian Slater, Kevin Pollack, Ice T also has a small role.It's not hard to see what attracted a cast like that to a movie about a gang of criminals robbing a casino dressed as Elvis. Sold it differently, I think it might have done differently. It had an excellent trailer, but seems confused about what type of movie it is. The robbery is superbly shot, as is the finale, but some scenes miss the target inbetween, and it runs a little too long. Cox is the obvious weak link here, not just for her performance, but her character is confusing too, as we never quite understand her motives, and her kid is as annoying kid actors get.But this is Costner's show, and his likability excuses the unpleasant violence his character often uses.For my money 3000 Miles To Graceland is a highly professional piece of work, suspenseful, with a good sense of pace and atmosphere it makes for perfect entertainment.Given the talent involved, I'm surprised this failed to find an audience.

In 3000 Miles To Graceland, Kurt Russell and Kevin Costner turn in star performances as former cell mates recently released from a federal penitentiary. When they first meet up on the outside, the look that Costner gives Russell as he slowly runs his gaze up and down Russell's body is almost sickening as you imagine the uncertain meeting of former cell mates might be. Costner has planned an elaborate heist at a Vegas casino during an Elvis convention in 2001, but things soon go awry. Kurt Russell co-stars, along with Courtney Cox, Thomas Haden Church, David Arquette, Howie Long and Jon Lovitz. Paul Anka even turns in a wickedly evil cameo performance as the chief of security at the Las Vegas casino where the film is staged. The group of thieves dress up as Elvis impersonators to pull off a big money robbery, and they plan to do it right in front of everybody. The succeed, after a fashion, but not without a hail of gunfire which caused most critics to give the movie resoundingly bad reviews. The shoot-em-up scenes are further enhanced with a grinding guitar-laced soundtrack-- that enhances the gunfire to an almost-too fevered pitch. The movie is about a bunch of ex-cons, and the so-called honor among thieves. If you can just keep the volume control close at hand, the shooting scenes are few and the intricate details of the camera work and the directing and ensemble acting are enough to create an enjoyable experience for the discerning viewer. At the end of the movie, as Costner is staring into a dirty restroom's grime-stained mirror, Elvis sideburns and a snarl on his lips, he says in a deep voice how do you like me now?--and you know that it's Elvis to whom he is speaking. Oh yeah, one of the guys gets the girl, but that may not be enough of a hook to bring your girlfriend or wife to this one!

But, as is the case, this is what the people want.The movie does do well in showing the terribleness of guns while still having good action scenes. The violence is not unlike that of more historical movies like 300 or worse. The violence is artistic, (if violence can ever be called that,) but it is violent. More or less, the bad content goes down to sex and language, take that out you have a violent action movie few would complain about. The movie has a good story involving a young boy, named after Jesse James the war hero turned criminal. The kid in the beginning is fascinated with gangsters which is a good theme for teens.Overall I must say it is a good movie for action fans who can handle the content, but these are things so abundant in our culture that people may fail to see the problem. If you, like I, don't like bad language there is better movies. If violence is what you don't like, there are good dramas and comedy's without it. Don't like sex in movies, as I feel the same with, let me know of good movies without it. But, it can be said that there are worse movies when it comes to content.

Ever since Reservoir Dogs, everybody and his brother in Hollywood has been trying to make hip action movies about lowlife-types.  It's the cool genre of the day.  Can anybody count all the small-time-crooks-in-cool-clothes movies in the last ten years? The problem is, the genre peaked sometime around '95 or '96.  Whenever that dog Things To Do In Denver came out, after that it was no longer hip or cool, just another Hollywood formula.So this movie is really out of time to begin with.  And then add the Elvis-Vegas thing, which was a hip ironic idea ten years ago, but which also feels tired and overdone in 2001.  All in all, this movie has the feel of a script that's been kicking around Hollywood boardrooms since about 1994.And because it only got made now, over the Tarantino-esque dialogue and irony you've got the over-the-top John Woo action style--slo-mo and techno--that's so popular now.  Problem is, slo- mo bullet orgies over a pounding techno soundtrack are kind of exactly the opposite of the laconic, ironic, lo-fi quality that Tarantino goes for, and that this story calls for.  So what we've got is a movie whose concept wants to appeal to alt-rock hipsters of the early nineties, who are nearing thirty by now, but whose style guarantees it's only going to click with techno-metal twelve-year- olds.  It's pumped-up where it should be hangdog, tight where it should be loose, ghastly where it should be funny.In spite of that it's pretty entertaining, even for a thirtyish wannabe alt-rock hipster, and it's all because of the cast.  Contrary to some people who've reviewed this, I think two of the three principals are fine.  Courtney Cox is current, but with Costner, Russell, Slater, D. Arquette, and Haden Church, even the casting feels like it's a time- slip back to the early nineties.  Most of them are underused, and Cox, although she's pretty damn hot in this movie, isn't exactly a great actress to begin with.But Costner and Russell are better in this than in anything I've seen them in for at least five years each.  Russell is in perfect Snake Plisskin/Hell Tanner form here, proving (as another reviewer said) that he's at his best in bad movies.  And Costner-- wow.  It's like he's taken all the frustration of everything he's done since Waterworld and poured it into this character.  Marvellously over-the-top.  Real fun.  In fact, one of the bigger disappointments in this movie is that we don't (spoiler ahead) get the big showdown between Russell and Costner that we're expecting.  Other than that, though, they look fantastic, and provide good, trashy fun.Overall, a pretty bad movie.  But entertaining, and the Russell- Costner matchup just about makes up for it.

None of the characters are likeable especially Costner as one of the sleaziest villains ever put on screen.  The whole movie is basically a boring road trip where the characters are trying to nab money from the robbed casino.  The only time when the movie picks up is during the shoot-outs.

It look me a while after I left to theather to decide if I liked it or not, but I ultimately realized I did enjoy it. Kevin Costner obviously had a blast playing a real psychopath, and shows just how tremendously talented he is. He shows that he really can play such a mean, short-tempered, sick, psychotic, SOB. But he still manages to work in some humor when he crosses the Canadian border disguised as a sports fan, driving a van who's owner he just killed and stashed in the back. Kurt Russell (as usual) was fantastic as the bad guy who's really not that bad deep down inside. The action is violent and bloody, just the way I like it! Thankfully, Ice-T doesn't show up until about the final fifteen minutes of the movie, and even then he only has about ten minutes of screen time. The movie's got enough style to spare, Courtney Cox shows some terrific dramatic talent during a great scene on board Russell's yacht, and Jon Lovitz is good without being annoying in a small cameo as a money launderer. Thomas Haden Church usually comes across as pretty dull and lifeless in everything but the television show WINGS, but he was surprisingly okay this time around. The opening credits sequence depicting a desert battle between two CGI scorpions is great, looking like something out of a MECHWARRIOR game. And the climactic shootout inside a warehouse is as violent and bloody as possible. The film's only weak spot is a very strange western-like confrontation between Costner and an Idaho highway patrol officer, which I'm still trying to figure out. This film is definitely not for the squeamish and is definitely not for children. The language is very rough (which I didn't have a problem with, but I'm sure there are those out there who would be very turned off by the film because of it) and the violence is pretty extreme. Not gory, but very bloody. The film at often times feels like a music video, since that's where the director got his start. There's even a music video that runs during the end credits, with Russell getting to do his Elvis thing again by lip-synching Elvis's Such A Night. This is most-likely a like it or hate it film. Those who hate Kevin Costner should be sure to stay away, because he practically steals the movie. Those who like him or want to see a violent, foul-mouthed, bloody action flick, 3000 MILES TO GRACELAND is the film for you.

Usually the story takes center stage in movies, but not in this film. Here, a plot is replaced with visual excitement-even though the excitement is spineless and sordid. The movie makes many big-time attempts to please its target audience young males looking for 125 minutes of loud, straightforward, manufactured, gratuitously bloody and mindless violence. If you fit that description then 3,000 Miles To Graceland is for you.The movie deserves credit for accomplishing the fine action sequences and capturing a certain feigned but still slightly intriguing style. It is no surprise that the film's director, Demian Lichtenstein, has amassed a great body of work with music videos. In 3,000 Miles to Graceland, he goes to the extreme with brain bash imagery, slow motion techniques, computer animation, and blurring fast forward motion effects. The soundtrack overflows with hard rock to fit the violent content, but there are a few scenes featuring Elvis music as well. If Lichtenstein's goal was to alienate viewers with mind-numbing camera effects, a vast gallery of colors, and enough gunfire for several action movies, then he has done his job successfully.In a production like this, as long as we care about the hero it is hard to go awry with such style and action. 3,000 Miles to Graceland makes it hard to care about anyone in the film. It glorifies dishonesty, cheating, mistrust, casual sex, greed, drinking, smoking, crime, murder, near nonstop profanity, robbery, and social irresponsibility. Almost every character in the film is corrupt, dishonest, murderous, and driven by greed. Even a small boy is involved with stealing and lying. How can audiences become involved in a story where the hero is a ex-con casino robber?The movie has a hard core cast, from top billed names like Kevin Costner and Kurt Russell to small but effective roles by Kevin Pollak and Jon Lovitz. Costner and Russell are Murphy and Michael, two ex-cons who just got out of jail. They are already planning their next heist with their buddies, Hanson (Christian Slater), Gus (David Arquette) and Franklin (Bokeem Woodbine). They intend on robbing the Riviera Casino as Elvis impersonators during International Elvis Week in good old Las Vegas.The casino robbery results in, of course, a composite of graphic violence and dozens of corpses. The sequence is intercut with an Elvis strip show on stage, an agonizing departure of women dancing to annoying musical numbers. Would dancers continue a routine while the casino is experiencing a massive shoot-out? The gang experiences disaster when the film's script fails to rewrite a stupid Hollywood rule the African-American dies first. After the killing of Franklin, the rest of the members squabble over the stolen three million dollars and how to split it up after the tragedy. Greed gets the best of Murphy; he kills the remaining colleagues and runs with the cash.Things aren't as they seem and the movie becomes a distraught tale of double crossings, triple crossings, and even quadruple crossings. A key character becomes Michael's romantic interest, played by Courteney Cox, who singularly mother's her eight year old child. She is a very confusing character; she has sex with Michael, but that is the extent of their relationship. Yet she leaves her son with Murphy for days without his consent. Would a mother really leave her kid with a convicted felon whom she only knew for a few days? Even worse this character is the movie's heroine.3,000 Miles to Graceland even tries its hands at comedy, a lot of comedy, but it is desperate, unfunny comedy. The most comedic of moments always derive out of the death of another person. Sitting through this production and actually enjoying it is definitely a feat. I can't even image liking such dirty, thoughtless action bewildered in a movie with a message about bad behavior and trusting your instincts. During the closing credits we witness the movie's most entertaining segments. Kurt Russell in an Elvis impersonation lip-synching to a familiar tune. If the rest of the production had this much irony, 3,000 Miles to Graceland still wouldn't be a very good movie-but at least it would be amusing one.

True, glancing at the cast of 3000 Miles to Graceland, the average Ice-T fan might be put off that his hero is so low in the billing. Then perusing through the film, the Ice-T fan might begin to wonder whether his hero's scenes were left on the editing room floor. At least, that's the impression one gets.While it seems at other theaters, the dominant question was aimed at the movie's scripting and casting capabilities. At my local movie-house however, I did not let the movie get away so easily, having nearly reached the ending without revealing its unique hidden talent Ice-T waiting for his turn to shine.SPOILER!Ice-T's character is named 'Hamilton'. He is a...SPOILER! ...weapons specialist.And as such, Hamilton is called in to bolster evil-Elvis Murphy's (Kevin Costner, in his finest role I might add, since playing the stiff in The Big Chill) team in the big climactic shootout versus the Feds in a dark, theatrically-lit industrial warehouse. The result is spectacular. But Ice-T's contribution to this movie start earlier, and can be broken down into three main parts, or 'acts'.Act I The Introduction to Hamilton -- Upon arrival at the warehouse, Murphy states to fellow crony Howie Long (Firestorm, the NFL) that they need more firepower. Cue Ice-T, who Long boasts 'is a couple of guys (in one)'.Act 2 Getting Inside Hamilton -- Murphy has thought ahead at this moment. Foreseeing a lengthy battle with the police, he has brought sandwiches. Offering one first to his child hostage (even tough guys gotta eat, he says), he then offers one to Ice-T. Would you like a jelly sandwich? Murphy asks. Ice-T, to this point a silent-but-deadly type, sneers a Billy-Idol-squared sneer and replies. Yeah, he retorts.Act 3 Hamilton At Work -- Possibly the coup-de-gras moment of the entire film, Ice-T shows his creative chops, bursting into the final gun battle sliding upside-down on a cable, spinning, twirling, firing two automatics at once, and then...SPOILER! ...he dies. Just like that. Like that kid in Pay It Forward, he dies for the greater cause, which Costner's Murphy then kills when he dies himself minutes later. All in all, as I stated earlier, quite possibly Ice-T's greatest (and shortest) moment in film. See this movie for him. After all, if you were in 3000 Miles to Graceland, Ice-T would watch it for you.

There are some decent scenes, and it was nice to see familiar faces portraying somewhat interesting characters, but the premise of the film is so lacking credibility that I felt irritated throughout.First of all, if you are going to rob a casino full of Elvis impersonators while being dressed like Elvis why don't you use this to help escape or blend in?? Then, how do you spray every camera except the one that shows you taking the money? Why would you then have to go through the entire casino floor to get to the roof? This would perhaps be the most ridiculous- but it is topped by the struggle which makes up the entire rest of the movie- the money is taken from HARD COUNT.Now anyone who knows anything about casinos knows that they take in a lot of cash money. This money has to be counted (these are the people in the room where the gang-o-thieves grab the cash). This is not money from the bank but money going to the bank and therefore this money is in no way marked and there is absolutely NO REASON for it to be marked. So going to find someone to launder this cash is completely idiotic. Therefore the rest of this movie is idiotic and makes no sense whatsoever. Really people, I know this isn't supposed to be real life but base a movie on some sort of reality. Or else call it science fiction or fantasy or something.

Films such as 3000 Miles To Graceland make me question the screenwriters ability to come up with an entertaining script.Two hours of non-stop gratuitous action and four high profile actors cannot make up for the lacking elements of 3000 Miles To Graceland. This film fails to reach the potential it had with the original concept.There is nothing new about 3000 Miles To Graceland because a similar plot was created to entertain audiences a year earlier called Reindeer Games. Since I enjoyed Reindeer Games, I thought I would enjoy this film; however, I was sorely disappointed to learn that this movie was nothing more than four men with a desire to play dress up in Elvis costumes. If I wanted to see Elvis impersonators, I would travel to Memphis and take part in the Elvis convention.The biggest problem I found with 3000 Miles To Graceland was understanding the reason why this film was made. Four men parading around in Elvis costumes is so uninteresting I felt like walking out of the theater and asking for my money back; something I rarely find myself doing.Another problem I had was the lack of focus and commitment showed by the actors. With each passing scene, it became painfully obvious that the actors were more interested in the concept of prancing around in costumes playing cowboys and indians.I failed to see the connection and relevance of most of the scenes. The scenes seemed to be slapped together and forced for the purpose of making another Elvis film. The writers must have had their minds on other topics because their effort certainly showed in the outcome.Zero plot, effort and character development equals a really bad written film. If I had a nickel each time I pointed out an irrelevant scene, the bank would go broke and I would be a rich man.Costner has been one of my favorite actors since I was a kid. Field Of Dreams marked the first time I saw this tremendous talent at work and I knew he had the ability to draw the audience into the film. With a roller coaster career that includes box office failures such as Waterworld and successes such as Dances With Wolves, Costner has proven he is only human.Watching Costner perform in 3000 Miles To Graceland was excrutiating because he put no effort into trying to make his character come alive. I look forward to the next Costner film because it is sure to be a hit.Russell has always been actor one can always count on to deliver powerful and comedic performances; however, he takes a nosedive with his worst film since Soldier. Like Costner, I sat through 3000 Miles To Graceland watching Russell perform in a flat and extremely one-dimensional role.It hurts to see an actor who has had a successful movie career make a huge mistake choosing to make this movie. I could only wish and hope he can rebound from this movie and get on track once again.The performances from the supporting cast were so awful it doesn't deserve any comment. Cox was out of her element and should return to working on sitcoms; Slater should make better decisions regarding which roles to take.3000 Miles To Graceland is far from its destination and drives itself into the ground as it strives to entertain viewers. Even with the firepower of Kevin Costner and Kurt Russell, 3000 Miles To Graceland could not overcome its over-glorification of Elvis Presley; two thumbs way down.Along with films such as All The Pretty Horses, Battlefield Earth, Soldier and Freddy Got Fingered; 3000 Miles To Graceland belongs in a graveyard containing films that should never be seen again.

A-uh-huh.Poster, slogan and title of this film are completely misrepresentative of the movie itself you've seen Kurt and Costner both healthily Elvis on the ad campaign, slammin' slogan Crime Is King splayed under their bejumpsuited selves - but the thrill of the heist and subsequent escape shreds like shooting-range flak in the first thirty minutes, which are very Super-Hero, Hard Guy, MTV-jump-cut, All Shook Up, flaming-gun-barrel, sneered lips, sequined cloaks and tight-panted thighs. And Kurt gets bonked TWICE by Courtney Cox in the ghetto! The film title refers to the cross-country trek Costner makes in an ambivalent attempt to escape the lazy arm of Harry Connick's and Kevin Pollak's Law and make Crime pay.Though an Elvis Heist may seem juvenile on paper, the irony is, the first thirty shake rattle and roll minutes - when they ARE actually pulling off The Caper as Elvises - are the best gutshock moments of the film!  The rest of the movie meanders like a deer caught in the headlights of its own exposition - that is, the movie was run down by the quality of its opening sequence.Then came act two, you seemed to change and you acted strange - And why I'll never know. It degenerates into your clichéd tale of Costner offing the rest of his purple gang to keep all the loot fer hisself. His gang David Arquette (perennial nerd and ultra-jerk - if a King Dork like this guy can score a bonk-junkie cyberbabe like Cox, there is yet hope for the rest of us), Christian Slater (walking the edge of Hard Guy and Court Jester), Bokeem Woodbine (token black dude), Kurt Russell (a hunka hunka burnin' love) and Kevin himself (screwloose hard guy with a really tasty gun).Well, Costner - bein' nothin' but a Hound Dog - offs the whole gang within five minutes of the heist, thinking he has also offed Kurt - but Kurt's wearing kevlar! - suddenly we are asked to accept that the COOLEST of these cats would be pussy enough to don a vest!? (Lord almighty - I feel my temperature risin'.) And here we were thinking that all these men LAUGHED in the face of death and flicked the ear of fatal woundings. Obviously one of them possesses enough insight and forethought to be wary of an Elvis impersonator who sports mutton-chop sideburns not as a disguise, but as a fashion statement (Costner), thereby sullying his Badness altogether, as we realize that he has all the impulsiveness of an ACCOUNTANT.  Through Unconscionable Afterthought Plot Points, Kurt makes off with the heist money, trailer-trash Courtney and her klepto kid, while Kevin is trying to extricate himself from the Egregious Coincidence Screenwriting.So Kevin goes after Kurt, picking up a Long Legged Girl (With A Short Dress On) along the way, killing a guy, blowing up a gas station, doing all those hard guy things that come natchelly to hard guys like his bad self.Round and round it goes, with Kevin and Courtney and Kurt and kid and cash in innumerable combinations of chasing each other, stranding one another, hi-tailing it down freeways, double-crossing, blackmailing, return to sender, snidely-whiplashing their way across the country, padding the film like a big fat Teddy Bear.Meanwhile, Harry Connick and Kevin Pollak, playing the two LAZIEST detectives ever committed to celluloid, half-heartedly follow Costner's trail of mindless meandering, mentioning at one point that Costner is `about 3000 miles to Graceland', and deliberating as to whether he is the Lost Son Of Elvis. A Little Less Conversation A Little More Action, please! The paternity is never resolved and by movie's end, when Connick and Pollak are standing over Costner's bloodied corpse, we are left guessing as to whether he WAS Elvis Junior - Is your heart filled with pain, shall I come back again? - No. Please, no sequels! I'm Hurt, much more than you'll ever know.Near movie's end, there is the incongruous appearance of Ice-T, brought in to help Costner kill some cops and step on some blue suede shoes. Kevin tries shooting Kurt again, but Roustabout Kurt HAS ANOTHER VEST ON - And Costner, not having a Suspicious Mind, FALLS for it again! It didn't really matter, cos by this time, I was bothering people around me with my singing and my big collar, who were all trying to get a little sleep.In a climactic sequence styled along the undeniably classic film-making style of Ed Wood, Ice-T, suspended by his feet, spinning upside-down, gets his Mojo Workin' and comes swinging across the shootout on a guy-wire with two machine-guns taped to his arms, blazing in all directions, as cops unload into him. It's almost worth the sit through this shiftless movie just to witness how excruciatingly hilarious his demise was. Almost.3000 miles of inane script later, at movie's end, Courtney and Kurt and kid and cash sailing off into the sunset on Kurt's boat, named - what else? - Graceland. (He has a BOAT?

There are some curious bits of dialogue clearly made up on set as they tried to plug the holes in the plot. Kurt Russell is as solid as ever, and Courtney Cox looks cute, though Monica keeps breaking through. Her part is so loosely written you can hardly blame her (except for taking the job). What all these people think they're doing spending good money on this nonsense is anybody's guess. What does it have to do with Elvis? Not much, in the end - don't worry about it. Only for audiences with severe attention deficit syndrome.

Films such as 3000 Miles To Graceland make me question the screenwriters ability to come up with an entertaining script. Two hours of non-stop gratuitous action and four high profile actors cannot make up for the lacking elements of 3000 Miles To Graceland. This film fails to reach the potential it had with the original concept.There is nothing new about 3000 Miles To Graceland because a similar plot was created to entertain audiences a year earlier called Reindeer Games. Since I enjoyed Reindeer Games, I thought I would enjoy this film; however, I was sorely disappointed to learn that this movie was nothing more than four men with a desire to play dress up in Elvis costumes. If I wanted to see Elvis impersonators, I would travel to Memphis and take part in the Elvis convention.The biggest problem I found with 3000 Miles To Graceland was understanding the reason why this film was made. Four men parading around in Elvis costumes is so uninteresting I felt like walking out of the theater and asking for my money back; something I rarely find myself doing.Another problem I had was the lack of focus and commitment showed by the actors. With each passing scene, it became painfully obvious that the actors were more interested in the concept of prancing around in costumes playing cowboys and indians.Though there was a plot somewhere scattered among this mess; however, I failed to see the connection and relevance of most of the scenes. The scenes seemed to be slapped together and forced for the purpose of making another Elvis film. The writers must have had their minds on other topics because their effort certainly showed in the outcome. Zero plot, zero effort and zero character development totals a really bad written film. If I had a nickel each time I pointed out an irrelevant scene, the bank would go broke and I would be a rich man.Costner has been one of my favorite actors since I was a kid. Field Of Dreams marked the first time I saw this tremendous talent at work and I knew he had the ability to draw the audience into the film. With a roller coaster career that includes box office failures such as Waterworld and successes such as Dances With Wolves, Costner has proved he is only human. Watching Costner perform in 3000 Miles To Graceland was terrible because he put no effort into trying to make his character come alive. I look forward to the next Costner film because it is sure to be a hit.Russell has always been actor one can always count on to deliver powerful and comedic performances; however, he takes a nosedive with his worst film since Soldier. Like Costner, I sat through 3000 Miles To Graceland watching Russell perform in a flat and extremely one-dimensional role. It hurts to see an actor who has had a successful movie career make a huge mistake choosing to make this movie. I could only wish and hope he can rebound from this movie and get on track once again.I would like to talk about the supporting cast; however, there performances were so awful it doesn't deserve any comment. Cox was out of her element and should return to sitcom fame; Slater should make wise decisions regarding which roles to take.3000 Miles To Graceland is far from its destination and drives itself into the ground as it strives to entertain viewers. Even with the firepower of Kevin Costner and Kurt Russell, 3000 Miles To Graceland could not overcome its over-glorification of Elvis Presley; two thumbs way down. Along with films such as All The Pretty Horses, Battlefield Earth, Soldier and Freddy Got Fingered; 3000 Miles To Graceland belongs in a graveyard containing films that should never to be seen.

At least, that's what the trailers made me believe the movie was about.The bank heist, however, is over after the first half-hour of the movie. After the heist, Murphy (Kevin Costner), who considers himself to be one of Elvis's illegitimate children, takes off with all the money.  Murphy is the leader of the gang and is the most brutal of the bunch.  Michael (Kurt Russell) is the cliché bad-guy-turned-good-guy whose tries to get the money back.  Yep, this movie has been made before about 800 times with 800 different titles.First, let me point out how violent this movie is.  I have seen violent movies in my day.  In fact, like most guys, I like violent movies.  I admit that.  But this movie goes over board, way over. This movie is not for children.  There are sex scenes (though no nudity), violent blood baths, strong language (the f word is used in every sentence, no joke), and drug use.  The excessive language, which is supposed to be cool, just sounds stupid and immature when it is repeated whenever an actor opens his or her mouth. None of this really bothered me too badly, but I do not recommend this movie for the squeamish.  Oh, and guys don't bring your girlfriend to this one.I have never in my life seen Costner like this.  This is a total change from what he normally does.  In this movie he kills every person he meets, he beats little children, and he hates, HATES, cops. His performance in this movie actually makes the audience hate him.  I sure did hate him, but not for the reason I was supposed to.  His performance is way over the top.The other acting is not too bad (Pu HA HA!  Oh I kill myself&#133;).  Kurt Russell isn't too bad considering his character sucks like a Dirt Devil. Cybil (Courtney Cox) is the love interest who is about as pointless in this movie as the plot.  David Kaye is Jesse, Cybil's ten-year-old son, who does a better acting job than most people in the movie.  The movie features many other actors John Lovitz, Ice-T, David Arquette, Howie Long, Kevin Pollack, and many others.The movie's excessive violence is one of its many problems.  Violence can be entertaining up to a point.  This movie goes over board, even for me.  Just like the language, the violence reaches a point that even twelve-year-olds will think is immature.Most stupid action movies throw logic out the window.  This movie throws it out the window, shoots it with an M-16, steps outside, shoots it again at point blank range, duct tapes a Claymore mine to it, runs away, and then blows it to China.  There is this scene where Costner gets pulled over by a county sheriff.  The sheriff steps out of the car and puts his hand near his gun as if he is challenging Costner to an Old Western duel.  Costner steps out of his car and, sure enough, they have a duel.  Please remember that the cop was pulling him over for speeding.  Does this cop duel with every speeding motorist he pulls over?  Does this make sense to you?  Don't worry, it's just as stupid on the screen as it is on paper.The movie is shot like a music video, which should not surprise anyone because the director is a former MTV music video director.  This funky style of shooting was made to give the movie style and make it cool.  Instead, it just makes it weird.  There is a lot of weirdness in this movie that stems from its urge to be cool.  Honestly, I hate this.  I'm an old fashioned guy who likes long, drawn out shots.  I like long takes.  I love Alfred Hitchcock.  I love any movie that has a scene that is done with one camera, in one take, for over 6 minutes.  That impresses me much more than any funky camera angle with a dozen shots edited into a six-minute scene. Why, you ask?  Because this shows that the actors memorized their lines, that the director cares about the characters, and above all it shows class. I due like the occasional funky camera angle.  But, 3,000 Miles is nothing but that.  I am not talking about cinematography.  This is not cinematography.  This is a bunch of idiots thinking, OO!  That's different! Let's do that, without thinking that their different idea is a bad one. To quote Jurassic Park, You are so busy thinking of what you could do, you never stopped to think if you should.Let us look at the opening fight sequence.  As the opening credits flash by, we are entertained, to use the term loosely, by two computer generated scorpions fighting.  The fight looks pretty cool, but after about ten minutes of watching it, the sequence just gets stupid.  It does not help that this scene is completely pointless.This movie tries really hard to be cool.  But, in the end, it comes off as stupid and weird. I will say that the movie is not completely bad.  Some scenes are funny.  Some of those violent action scenes are pretty cool.  I think that most of you males reading this would enjoy 3,000 Miles, or at least part of it.  But it is in no way a good movie.  In fact, it's terrible.Is the movie worth it?  No.  Oh, no.  If you get to see it for free, then yea, go ahead.  You don't need to completely avoid it.   But, don't pay for it.  Oh please, don't do that.2/10  "},{"Title":"Nothing Sweet Or Silly Here....","Date":"21 August 2010","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":" I never saw this film on the big screen.

The question will be whether the viewer finds more pleasure than guilt. I felt a bit of each when I watched this movie, but like it or not, there is no argument to be had over the lack of intelligence of this film. To truly love 3000 Miles to Graceland, you would have to be as dumbed-down as the filmmakers. Demian Lichtenstein doesn't know how to write or direct, and Kevin Costner wouldn't know the meaning of slick in this film if it came up and bit him in the rear. Kurt Russell is acceptable, because he does a pretty decent Elvis Impersonation (especially during the closing credits, if you make it that far).The show starts at a cheap little Nevada hotel, which becomes the rendezvous for Micheal Zane and Thomas Murphy, old partners in crime who are planning to rob the Riviera Casino in Vegas during international Elvis week. With four other goons, they steal three million dollars, but Murphy double crosses his team, shoots them in cold blood, and runs off with the dough. Somehow he loses it. Turns out not all his team are dead. With the help of a gimmicky plot twist, Michael lives, and with with his new girlfriend and her son they go after the money, while the police are trying to track down both him and Murphy.With films like this, the stupidity washes over you if you get into the story, as it does here for the first half hour, which is flashy, amusing, and with a few good sets and shots. The rest of the film is just nasty, reckless, and obnoxiously violent. In his pitiful excuse for a screenplay, Lichtenstein is cruel to so many people black people, deaf people, waitresses, mothers, children, and especially cops. To make it worse, he is also mean-spirited towards his characters. With the exception of Michael, everybody is an idiot or a piece of cardboard. Kevin Costner probably abused his power as a famous actor and demanded more screen time, because he gets way too much. His character is the main cause of trouble for the picture he is a cruel sadistic schmuck who does terrible things to people. If he were better written, 3000 miles to Graceland would still be a lame movie, but far less nauseating. Like I said, 3000 Miles to Graceland is a very difficult film to like let alone love. However, if you want to see if you can prove me (or most other critics) wrong, give it a try - although I could probably think of 3000 better things to do with your time and money.

While Elvis week is going on in Las Vegas, the two decide to take along a few men and dress up as the King himself to rob one of the city's largest casino's. The plan works, but when one of the group goes bad, the score they had thought would bring them such easy money brings them nothing but death and deceit. Kurt Russell and Kevin Costner star in 3000 Miles to Graceland, a crime/action film about two friends who put together an ingenious plan to rob a Las Vegas Casino during Elvis week dressed as the icon himself. Russell plays Michael Zane, a cocky ex-con, who along with his ultra-cool partner Murphy (a fantastic Kevin Costner), put together a loose group of criminals to pull of this daring Vegas heist. However, when one of them decides he doesn't want to share their newfound wealth, all hell breaks loose, leaving only two of the group alive. Now the survivors must hunt each other down for a purse worth three point two million dollars. Really, I can't explain in words how disappointed I was with this movie. I was expecting the action event of the summer, but what I got was more like a bad indoor concert. The film shined with a bright cast including Costner, Russell and a host of others, including Christian Slater and Bokeem Woodbine as two members of the group, and a wasted Courtney Cox Arquette as Russell's love interest, Cybil Waingrow. However, the good members of the cast, minus the two stars and Cox, are only in the beginning of the movie, and then are never to be seen again. Cox's character, unlike herself, is an unappealing piece of white trash that I had wished was done away with at the beginning of the film, thus leaving room for one of the other likeable characters to move along with the story. Russell (in the worst role of his career), plays the good guy to such a disgusting tee that I found myself rooting for the bad guy the whole way through this extremely weak actioner. The movie boasts the robbery as its main element, but this scene only occurs for about fifteen minutes of the entire film, before it turns itself in to a ridiculously predictable game of cat and mouse between good guy and bad guy. All I can say is that director/writer/producer, Demian Lichtensten, really let me down. The movie starts off well enough, with Costner taking the reigns for the action sequences and the great Casino heist concept, but the rest of this overlong drivel seems like nothing more than an ode to Elvis. Scenes of such ridiculousness are thrown in to this movie, such as an Elvis Impersonators musical number going on during the Casino shootout, and Howie Long's lame death, that I really wonder what Lichtensten had to do to get anyone to back this atrocity. Co-writer, Richard Recco, helped to pull this one six feet under by displaying utterly poor writing skills, and adding scenes in to the movie such as Courtney Cox telling Kurt Russell that she loves him while he's holding her and her son at gunpoint. How sweet. I cannot believe that with all the potential this film had, that after twenty minutes it's able to turn so sour and rotten I would have rather drank a carton of expired milk. At least then I would have gotten the medical attention I needed.  Aside from Costner, Slater and a couple of good action sequences, this film is no more than a bad Elvis movie, only worse because Elvis isn't even in it and it's easily more predictable. So unless you're a fan of Elvis or even Elvis humor, do as I will do from now on, and stay a million miles away from 3000 Miles to Graceland.Overall Rating 3 out of 10 "},{"Title":"Why do they do such awful movies?","Date":"28 April 2003","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":"  The only thought provoked by 3000 miles to Graceland is why do they do such awful movies?

Kurt Russell and Costner are equally awful in the leading roles. Christian Slater's involvement is absolutely inexplicable - why hire an a-list comic actor if you're going to give him three lines and (SPOILER) kill off his character after 40 minutes?The cast is uniformly bad, but the script is worse, the music is worse still, and the direction is worst of all. By turns lazy and pretentious, Demian Lichtenstein manages to disengage the viewer's interest within about 3 minutes of the beginning (quite an achievement), right after the pointless CGI scorpion fight sequence. The heist scene is probably the worst of its kind ever committed to celluloid; the guy who described it as being like an arcade game was spot-on, but Time Crisis beats it hands-down for cinematic skill and tension. As I watched it, I thought 'This is exactly why Tarantino skipped the bank robbery in Reservoir Dogs'. Also, remember how everyone hated the scene in Attack of the Clones where Natalie Portman falls down the hill and a storm-trooper helps her up? It was unnecessary, patronizing and slothful.

The same basic crime story of a bunch of criminals who make a killing and then end up killing each other over the money. But there are some good parts to this all-star crime adventure, chief among them is Kevin Costner's menacing portrayal of a psychopathic Elvis fan. Generally an actor with a limited range to his abilities (see Robin Hood Prince of Thieves), Costner convincingly portrayed basically everything that antihero Kurt Russell's character was not.The story follows five crooks and a getaway helicopter pilot as they rob a Las Vegas casino during the celebration of Elvis Presley's birthday. The mastermind behind this, Thomas J. Murphy (Costner) we later discover is actually one of two of the fans of the King claiming to be related to him that was never disproven. Kurt Russell's character is an ex-con looking to do a last job before leaving on a boat he has at Mt. Vernon. He becomes mixed up with a single mother and her son, who likes to take things from people. But Russell's character, while acting tough, really seems not to want to kill, (and never does).After one of the men is shot during the robbery, Costner is unwilling to divide his share among the others, which enrages one of the men, played by Christian Slater. Slater is shot soon afterward and after taking his body away along with the other man's, Costner shoots both David Arquette and Russell, not knowing that Russel is wearing a bullet-proof vest.So begins an adventure involving a greedy single mother and her ne'er-do-well son, a psycho, two U.S. Marshals, a crook with a heart of gold, and pitfalls like a cowboy cop, a slutty girl working at a gas station, a prison in Boise, and two warring scorpions.

It had action galore and plenty of humor (I liked the dark humor best), and the soundtrack was pretty good too. I really enjoyed the two main characters played by Kostner and Russell because they both gave a great performance of being the bad guys. Russell's character because of his drive for that last big score and how he avoided injuring anyone that would get in the way, and Kostner's for how he didn't give a damn, just as long as he got his money. I particularly liked Kostner for his shoot 'em cowboy image that he brought to the screen. I think my favorite scene was when he actually did have an old time gunfight with a trooper that pulled him over. Courtney Cox's character was a bit on the drab side but if you like a movie with lots of action then this is it. If you pay attention to the clues you'll notice that Russell's character is really the illegitimate son of Elvis.

Repeats can still be seen Saturday mornings on the Sci-Fi channel.Unfortunately, some recent big-budget Hollywood movies are so astonishingly bad that laughter is the only appropriate response.  Battlefield Earth was one, Stallone's Get Carter remake was another, and 3000 Miles to Graceland is surely a third.Be warned that 1,000 words can only begin to describe just how bad this movie is.SPOILERS AHEAD!The opening scenes for Russell, Courtney and Costner are extraordinarily lame. Russell and Courtney engage in the two funniest sex scenes I've seen in any movie, then Russell puts a Snickers bar on Courtney's pillow, because she told him that if the lovemaking was nice he should give her chocolate.Russell dons his Elvis regalia, and heads for Vegas.  The director uses LOTS of obnoxious speeded-up film to get there quickly, while a brainless techno beat drones on the soundtrack.  Costner finally lumbers into view in his Elvis regalia, looking uncomfortable; then he and the other crooks march into the casino like they're the Wild Bunch or the Untouchables or the Reservoir Dogs.The casino heist should be an impressive set-piece, but it's hilariously brainless.  The crooks march down an ordinary hallway (no guards or security checkpoints) and come to an ordinary door (no guards, just one camera). They unload a huge arsenal from their guitar cases (of course they weren't checked by security), and only then do they spray the camera that's recording them!  The lock on the door is pathetic, and the crooks break in easily.  A guy gets up, Costner breaks his face with his shotgun, then says `All right!  Everybody STAY COOL!'  Of course the counting room is filmed in a barfy blue color, and the director shakes the camera like Oliver Stone would.The crooks do nothing about the security cameras in the room, so of course they're spotted and guards move in as they cross the gaming area.  Since Slater and the others are carrying their automatic weapons in plain view, their Elvis disguises are useless.  Why did they even bother?  Because the director wanted to film a shoot-out in which guys dressed like Elvis kill lots of people, and that's precisely what happens.The shoot-out is so badly directed (guards hurry into view like video-game targets so Costner and friends can mow them down in slow motion), appallingly edited (What the hell is happening?), and accompanied by such junky music that it practically embodies bad film-making.  Get aspirin or Dramamine from your medicine cabinet before watching this dizzyingly bad sequence.Post-heist, Costner shoots the others (even Russell) in an unsurprising double-cross.  But he runs into a coyote (seriously!) and suffers head injury from the accident, an amazingly stupid contrivance that allows Russell (his vest stopped Costner's bullets) to escape with the loot after negotiating with Courtney in an extremely tiresome and badly written scene.The movie's second act alternates between annoying scenes with Russell and Courtney and revolting scenes with Costner, whose astonishingly pathetic performance cannot be condemned enough.  He obviously didn't care whether the movie was good, only that the check was good.  Ditto for Russell, though he at least appears honestly embarrassed in most of his scenes.  Being in this movie, apparently, was punishment enough.One atrocious scene shows Costner stopping at a gas station with a B-25 (I think) perched on top.  Why is the plane there?  So Costner can drop a flowing gas nozzle on the ground (while turtle-brained music plays), light a cigarette, then drop it as he drives away, exploding the station and sending the plane into the air, the director filming this from several different angles in SLOW MOTION!The movie's nauseating third quarter is actually relieved by its hilariously bad finale after chasing Courtney's car down with a van (the director films this chase in jerky fast-motion photography, playing some rock garbage to make the whole sequence as bottom-of-the-barrel as possible), and literally kicking Courtney's butt, Costner says `Now what I want, is my money.ALL OF IT!'  Such dialogue, when combined with Costner's uniquely pathetic delivery, becomes hilarious.Her son now Costner's hostage, Courtney confronts Russell on his boat to beg his help.  He doesn't believe her, so she starts crying.and her crying is so pathetic!  It's the single worst piece of acting in the entire movie, and one of its funniest moments!  I'm surprised that no other comment has mentioned it.Russell and Costner meet in an abandoned warehouse (!), where Russell distracts Costner with a duffel bag of newspaper instead of THE MONEY, and several SWAT teams arrive.  Costner tells Russell `You're going back in a bag!', and shoots him (again!).  Russell hits the ground, the rumble music starts, and Costner starts running around killing dozens of SWAT guys, who can't hit him even once, despite their laser sights, the help of searchlights, and the confined area.  Costner and his two remaining accomplices (Howie Long and Ice-T) murder lawmen on a scale resembling the massacres at Ruby Ridge and Waco, Texas.Trapped and wounded in the warehouse office, Costner looks over at a mirror and says `You recognize me now?.'Cause I recognize YEW!'  Shooting the mirror, he turns to face the encircling SWAT team, watches their laser sights dance on his chest, and starts shooting.  They shoot him into hamburger, Clyde Barrow-like, and he drops beside a toilet, Elvis-like, completing a mesmerizingly awful death-scene.Costner, Russell and Courtney and assorted others really drove their movie careers into the ground with this stupid, pretentious, mean-spirited and incoherent movie; it's a career nadir for both Russell and Costner, remarkable considering their share of bad movies.  I give it a point each for, respectively, the amazingly stupid direction, the unintentionally funny dialogue, and the unforgettably pathetic performances.  Watch and laugh.Rating 4  "},{"Title":"Awesome movie, mostly intended for guys","Date":"17 November 2002","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":"  SOME SPOILERS AHEADI loved this movie!  It was action-packed and exhilerating, right from the get-go.  It's a lot different from what its trailers might indicate, but that's part of the beauty of it.  The movie, however, is not intended to be taken completely seriously.  If it was it would really suck.  Those who watch this movie should keep an open mind and remember that it's all about entertainment.  Of course, the plot is still meritable and believable, with a few small exceptions.  Maybe they just don't show it in the sequence, but as far as the movie shows, they only have to break down one little door to gain access to the casino vault.  That and the fact that Russell seems to always be wearing a kevlar vest, along with a few over-zealous explosions, are the few small drawbacks.  Otherwise, the action scenes are excellent, the story is entertaining and believable, and, probably one of the biggest accomplishments in action movie-making, the love story is believable.  The ending was perfect with Costner's guns-blazing rebel-against-authority demise.  By the way, I thought Costner was by far the best actor in this movie, who played his psycho part well, and makes himself out to be one bad mother..I think, because of all the violence in this movie, most girls probably wouldn't like it, but good for you if you do!

The opening sequence was a bizarre computer animated sequence which had really nothing to do with the plot, and just seemed out of place from the word go.  From there on in the film did not manage to recover, the director deciding to use a heavy nu-metal soundtrack, instead of one that should in theory have included many Elvis songs. This bad judgement ruined a few scenes, especially Costner's final scene. On the whole I found that the acting was quite decent. Courteney Cox was a bit miscasted, but the rest of the cast were good.

Imagine my surprise when the big robbery scene, which I figured would be the dramatic, action-packed climax scene, opens the movie, so the good stuff is out of the way in the first 20 minutes.

Films such as 3000 Miles To Graceland make me question the screenwriters ability to come up with an entertaining script. Two hours of non-stop gratuitous action and four high profile actors cannot make up for the lacking elements of 3000 Miles To Graceland. This film fails to reach the potential it had with the original concept.There is nothing new about 3000 Miles To Graceland because a similar plot was created to entertain audiences a year earlier called Reindeer Games. Since I enjoyed Reindeer Games, I thought I would enjoy this film; however, I was sorely disappointed to learn that this movie was nothing more than four men with a desire to play dress up in Elvis costumes. If I wanted to see Elvis impersonators, I would travel to Memphis and take part in the Elvis convention.The biggest problem I found with 3000 Miles To Graceland was understanding the reason why this film was made. Four men parading around in Elvis costumes is so uninteresting I felt like walking out of the theater and asking for my money back; something I rarely find myself doing. Another problem I had was the lack of focus and commitment showed by the actors. With each passing scene, it became painfully obvious that the actors were more interested in the concept of prancing around in costumes playing cowboys and indians.Though there was a plot somewhere scattered among this mess; however, I failed to see the connection and relevance of most of the scenes. The scenes seemed to be slapped together and forced for the purpose of making another Elvis film. The writers must have had their minds on other topics because their effort certainly showed in the outcome. Zero plot, zero effort and zero character development totals a really bad written film. If I had a nickel each time I pointed out an irrelevant scene, the bank would go broke and I would be a rich man.Costner has been one of my favorite actors since I was a kid. Field Of Dreams marked the first time I saw this tremendous talent at work and I knew he had the ability to draw the audience into the film. With a roller coaster career that includes box office failures such as Waterworld and successes such as Dances With Wolves, Costner has proven he is only human. Watching Costner perform in 3000 Miles To Graceland was terrible because he put no effort into trying to make his character come alive. I look forward to the next Costner film because it is sure to be a hit.Russell has always been actor one can always count on to deliver powerful and comedic performances; however, he takes a nosedive with his worst film since Soldier. Like Costner, I sat through 3000 Miles To Graceland watching Russell perform in a flat and extremely one-dimensional role. It hurts to see an actor who has had a successful movie career make a huge mistake choosing to make this movie. I could only wish and hope he can rebound from this movie and get on track once again.I would like to talk about the supporting cast; however, there performances were so awful it doesn't deserve any comment. Cox was out of her element and should return to sitcom fame; Slater should make wise decisions regarding which roles to take.3000 Miles To Graceland is far from its destination and drives itself into the ground as it strives to entertain viewers. Even with the firepower of Kevin Costner and Kurt Russell, 3000 Miles To Graceland could not overcome its over-glorification of Elvis Presley; two thumbs way down. Along with films such as All The Pretty Horses, Battlefield Earth, Soldier and Freddy Got Fingered; 3000 Miles To Graceland belongs in a graveyard containing films that should never be seen again.

Its a piece of junk, don't get me wrong, but it has entertainment value. and...Costner's dopey Adam West overacting (or is it under acting) finally fits in somewhere. I don't want to give this too much of my time, as it really isn't worth it. Its about a bunch of Elvis worshiping ex-cons who pull off a casino heist. More to the point, its about the post-robbery chicanery BS that's been done 3000 times - at least. But its got a lot of style, and I think it will hold your attention, well for the most part. There's a nice Matrix shootout rip-off scene, complete with I think the same background music and those are always fun to watch. Its placed at a perfect part of the film to wake you up just in case Costner over sedates you. The writing particularly the quips are above average. Cant say I'm glad I watched it, but Ive sat through much worse. Might be even better if when viewing, you're blood alcohol content is somewhere near your age.  Almost forgot, unquestionably the best part of the film is Kurt Russell's Elvis rendition as the credits roll. No sarcasm there, its a lot of fun to watch.

In fact I only heard negative things about 3000 Miles to Graceland, which is called Crime is King in Germany and in fact I like that title better than the original one. (I think it was the american tagline of the movie). The film got five razzie-award-nominations, which is definitely unfair. There were many worser movies in 2001, which hadn't been nominated, e.g. Tomcats, Corky Romano and the most terrible of all Ghosts of Mars. Even Planet of the Apes is not as good as Crime is King. Of course the screenplay is not very logical, but it is not boring, as many people wanted me to believe. There are great actors, also in the supporting roles ; Christian Slater and David Arquette are too good for their very short roles, but who cares ? Russell and especially Costner are a pity to watch - I never saw Kevin Costner playing a role like this - totally different from his last movie Dragonfly. He really is cool. The action scenes are just brillant - the brutal and bloody casino-scenes, the explosion of the fuel station, the car stunts - especially the one with Cox and Costner on the fairground - and of course the final shooting. The moviemakers didn't believe their movie to be serious, as you can see in the great duel-sequence and the funny scorpion-fight at the beginning. This is just fun - it is similar with the musical performance during the end credits - brillant. The funniest scene has Kurt Russell, I just say one word - Snickers.

Kurt Russel STILL looks extremely cool in Presley-outfit, but why they chose Costner to play the ultimate bad-ass, I'll never understand. Costner is the kind of actor that makes you think everything's gonna be OK at some point in a movie, because he is, and will stay, a 'feel-good'actor. But the character he portrays here is totally over the top. He hates everything, including kids! That just didn't work for me.

The first 25 minutes are promising, but Slater and Arquette get offed much too early, leaving Russel, Costner and Cox with a predictable and overstretched Good-badguy / Bad-badguy / Desperate chick cliche...

They have three sex scenes (no nudity though), and violence and language throughout. Kevin Coster plays Murphey, a man who believes himself to be one of the son's of Elvis that Elvis never knew about. Him and his friend Michael (Kurt Russel) who plays the bad guy gone good who tries to get a cache of money back from Murphey after a daring Las Vegas casino heist.*SPOILERS* This movie is a violent blood bath from start to finish. Everyone who is involved with the casino heist is either immediately killed off or....immediately killed off. Bokeem Woodbine is killed off during the heist. Christian Slater is killed off while arguing about dividing up shares of the money. And Murphey kills David Arquette's character off (for no other apparant reason that just killing him out of boredom) while helping him dump Christian Slater's body. I also wish that we could've seen more of Howie Long. He was under used and underdeveloped. Jon Lovitz is also killed off in his first and only scene of the movie. He is only in there for about ten minutes at the most. All of these people are listed as the film's main characters and they are killed off within the first forty-five minutes of the movie! But, Kevin Coster is really good at making the audience hate him. His role in this film is much different than what we normally see him in. Although I don't know what was so special about this movie that attracted such great stars (other examples being Kevin Pollack and Thomas Haden Church who play two detectives trying to follow Murpehy's trail of blood). Ice-T even has a small part. He plays a mercenary that is hired to kill off cops while Murphey and Jack (Howie Long) try to retrieve the money from whatever happened to it. Courtney Cox also has a part as the damsel in distress. Her scenes are some of the most boring (except for the shot of her tight butt through her leather pants). Hehehe. So, my overall opinion is that 3000 MILES TO GRACELAND is a volatile action thriller. It deserves atleast 2/5 stars for being different.

It shocks me to see so many talented actors star in a film that has no reason being made. If you haven't already seen this movie, do not waste your time or money.Kevin Costner, Kurt Russell, Christian Slater and Courtney Cox are far from their destination as they try to reach Graceland. Films such as 3000 Miles To Graceland make me question the screenwriters ability to come up with an entertaining script. Two hours of non-stop gratuitous action and four high profile actors cannot make up for the lacking elements of 3000 Miles To Graceland. This film fails to reach the potential it had with the original concept.There is nothing new about 3000 Miles To Graceland because a similar plot was created to entertain audiences a year earlier called Reindeer Games. Since I enjoyed Reindeer Games, I thought I would enjoy this film; however, I was sorely disappointed to learn that this movie was nothing more than four men with a desire to play dress up in Elvis costumes. If I wanted to see Elvis impersonators, I would travel to Memphis during the time of year the Elvis convention is held.The biggest problem I found with 3000 Miles To Graceland was understanding the reason why this film was made. Four men parading around in Elvis costumes is so uninteresting I felt like walking out of the theater and asking for my money back; something I rarely find myself doing. Another problem I had was the lack of focus and commitment showed by the actors. With each passing scene, it became painfully obvious that the actors were more interested in the concept of prancing around in costumes playing cowboys and indians.Though there was a plot somewhere scattered among this mess; however, I failed to see the connection and relevance of most of the scenes. The scenes seemed to be slapped together and forced for the purpose of making another Elvis film. If I earned a nickel each time I pointed out an irrelevant scene, the bank would go broke and I would be a rich man.Costner has been one of my favorite actors since I was a kid. Field Of Dreams marked the first time I saw this tremendous talent at work and I knew he had the ability to draw the audience into the film. Since this release of this film, Costner's career has been a roller coaster. With box office failures such as Waterworld and successes such as Dances With Wolves, he has proven he is only human. So, when the outcome of this film was revealed it came as no shock because Costner was as flat as a one dollar bill.Most of his films have been character-driven, thought-provoking that brought out emotions. 3000 Miles To Graceland is Costner's first film that truly disappointed me. As much as it pains me, I can't recommend this film to my friends because. 3000 Miles To Graceland is a flat, one-dimensional and disorganized film that contains more negatives than positives. I can't believe so many fine actors signed on to participate in this atrocious film.On the other hand, Russell stars in his worst movie since Soldier. His character and performance is flat as cardboard and extremely one-dimensional. It hurts to see an actor who has had a successful movie career make a huge mistake choosing to make this movie. I could only wish and hope he can rebound from this movie and get on track once again.3000 Miles To Graceland is far from its destination and drives itself into the ground as it strives to entertain viewers. Even with the firepower of Kevin Costner and Kurt Russell, 3000 Miles To Graceland could not overcome its over-glorification of Elvis Presley. Two Thumbs way down. 3000 Miles To Graceland has joined movies such as All The Pretty Horses, American Beauty and Battlefield Earth to share the honor being called the worst of the worst.

If you rent an action movie you want cool special effects and lots of gunfire. 3000 miles to graceland has this in liberal amounts.However, I must admit, this film wouldn't be worth writing a review about if it wasn't for Kevin Costners performance. Seeing Costner as a hard as nails psycho was a memorable occasion for me and for some reason I actually found myself cheering for him in some parts. Previously Costner's roles have been decidedly boring to me apart from Prince Of Thieves, however, I have always thought him to be of considerable talent. It's nice to see him trying something new I guess.Oh yeah, Kurt Russell is supposed to be the star of this film, but yeah, he is kind of boring as the classic not really a bad guy, just a bankrobber by profession, that's all.*Note* I have no doubt I would have thought less of this film had I been 'hyped' up for it, which is unfortunately what happens with many major blockbusters these days.Rating  6.5/10  (If you want guns.

I have to hand it to the writers of this movie, for thepremise is quite creative. Plus the Elvis song number in the end is catchy, too. But 3000 MILES TO GRACELAND suffers is a crime drama thatrelies too much on the constant gun battles, the big-name casting, and the overly flashy production values. Not much quality acting is at stake, even at the hands of the usually competent Russell and Costner.

I have seen far more graphic and stylised violence in many films considered mainstream.Some of the gun fights and action scenes are executed like they were directed by John Woo on LSD.

Naturally the black guy is the first to die and in the most stupidest way.  Then they split up the money amongst themselves and they all go their separate ways.  All that's just in the first thirty minutes!  To put it simply, the story sucks, the acting is choppy and Kevin Costner is totally unlikeable in his role.  I've never seen him like this before and he isn't really all that convincing as a bad guy.  Of course this is an action film, so you don't really need to have a decent plot or good acting.  The violence here is pretty bloody especially the casino shoot out and the ending shoot out.  I do think that one of the high points of the movie is when Kurt Russell BANGS the hell out of Courteney Cox TWICE within the first twenty-five minutes.

So we find ourselves back at why this movie was so bad? Maybe it was the scenes where we all talk about how everyone is double-crossing everyone else endlessly..that gets old.  We know why everyone is motivated to do what they do, stop explaining it.

Cox fills out a miniskirt nicely, but is otherwise horrible.  A star-studded supporting cast is totally wasted, including Kevin Pollak & Thomas Haden Church as the lawmen woefully two steps behind the inept criminals.  Are federal marshalls really this stupid??  These two spend way too much time exchanging witty banter to do any real policework, apparently. Christian Slater sinks deeper into the abyss with what measures up to be an extended cameo.  And Costner is the worst offender, likely trying to shed his good guy image.  He succeeds, but he still hasn't shed his bad actor in a bad movie image.And the acting isn't even the worst part - this film is totally devoid of any logic whatsoever.  Double & triple crosses in the incredibly underelaborate casino robbery become more & more preposterous as the plot unfolds & a storyline involving Costner possibly being the son of Elvis Presley falls particularly flat & goes entirely unresolved after the film's climactic bloodbath.I could go on, but I think you get the picture.

I still paid money, but I would have been upset if I had paid $8.75 instead of $3.91 at Blockbuster.There are no redeeming characters in this film.  Everyone is out for something.  Even the cops played by Church and Pollack aren't what you would call the finest in the law enforcement ranks.  I understand that Russell's character kept getting manipulated by Courtney Cox Arquette's character because the screenwriter wanted to show that he wasn't that much of a bad guy.  In another film, her scheming character and her bratty kid would have been dumped off on the road and/or killed within the first fourty five minutes.  Her character was just filling, just so there'd be a romantic interest and a damsel in distress to give the anti-hero something to save. The violence is just there for the sake of seeing people riddled with bullets (and in one case, arrows).  It's pointless, unimaginative, and tired.  As usual in most of these types of films, an African-American is the first to be sacrificed (this is a practice that long needed to be retired in screenplays).  The film is populated with a gang of stars that are seen for limited times, when the cameras aren't on Costner, Russell, and Ms. Arquette.  However, they add little to the cut and paste plot.

I admit it is a little simplistic at times, it also has a lot to it. many audiences these days think film noir is dead, they are wrong. A lot of people do not have the patience for fim noir, but if you do ,it pays off. No one in this movie is innocent. Kurt Russell's character starts out bad, but when he realises what he has done, he seeks redemption. Kevin Costner is an especially evil villian and he does a good job of it. ( By the way, I HATE Kevin Costner!!!) Also the violence in the movie is done in the style of Asian Action Hong Kong Cinema, which is more extreme than Americans are used to. This movie is by no means perfect, but it doesn't matter, because this was cool. Hey, It's an action movie, not Shakespeare. Action Movies aren't for too much thinking. THe style in this movie is not nessesarily unique, but it is seldom used, and it is done in a whole new way. There are plenty of twists and turns to keep you entertained.

I usually try to avoid this kind of stuff because I've gotten really fed up with directors trying to copy John Woo (who's style I strongly dislike) with all of the slow-mo, dramatic looking, action scenes that make me smack my forehead.  The reason I gave this movie a chance is because it looked to be a movie that was trash and knew it was trash.  I also wanted to see Costner playing a villain.  The guy has taken such a bashing over the last few years.  The critics had a field day with the Postman, and when he tried to make a return to form with For Love of the Game, he got trashed again.With 3MKTG, it's like Costner just said to hell with it and snatched up the part.  It's a good thing he did.  I've never thought of him as a villain, but he sure is fun to watch.  In this, he chews the scenery like a wood chipper, utters the funniest obscenities this side of DeNiro, and kicks the ass of everyone he comes in contact with. Male or female.  He is so ruthless in his part, I actually had trouble believing that this is the same guy who brought us Dances With Wolves.  Kurt Russell does fine but Costner steals the show.I've heard all the talk about the style in which this movie was made (like a music video) but I must say that it was kind of cool.  The gunfights did have that stupid woo look to them, but I didn't mind it here.  There is absolutely nothing here to take serious so the slow-mo effects weren't weighed down with that stupid forced intimacy that Woo shovels onto us.The dialogue is pretty funny.  Almost every line out of Costner's mouth is memorable and the Wombat van scene had me in stitches.  He is such a cool and nasty character, I found myself rooting for him rather than Kurt Russell.<spoiler-alert> It's obvious, before the movie even starts, how things are going to end up, and when the time came, (I hate to admit it) I was actually moved. What a way to go down, though.  That was probably my favorite scene. The final shootout is loud, bloody, and surprisingly effective.  New Disease by Spineshank is blasting away in the background and ups the ass-kicking level even higher. Ignore the reviews, rent the flick and be your own judge. It may not be anything groundbreaking or original but it's pure trash and it knows it. Hell, it even takes pride in it.  I'm off to buy the dvd.

On to the plot... Its mindless; doesn't force you to think but carries you along for a great ride.  Five guys (at least two of them are ex-cons) decide to rob a casino during the Elvis convention in Vegas.  Nothing too high-concept but what did you expect, its an action flick! The rest of the story deals with double-crosses, unwanted baggage, the obligatory police investigation, and many, many bullets. I went into this movie expecting to like it and I really did, probably more than I should.  Its not going to make any top ten lists or sweep the Academy off its collective feet,  but this film wasn't trying to do that.  It does its job, ENTERTAIN! Kurt Russell is great and likeable as our films (anti) hero. (I am a huge Kurt Russell fan though-Jack Burton...ME!)  But the real surprise is Kevin Costner's role as the film's bad guy.  I put that in quotes because although you hate his character, you gotta love the fact that he plays an excellent nut-job! A HUGE departure for him.  Besides Courtney Cox-Arquette and the young man who portays her son (with a potentially bright future I might add), the rest of the very cool supporting cast doesn't get much screen time. The soundtrack is SPECTACULAR! Bands like Filter( scorpion battle credit sequence), SpineShank, and hed(pe) (ending shootout) accompany the mandatory Elvis tunes as well as others.  Paced well and conveys the feel needed for each particular scene the songs are used in. (P.S  Closing credit sequence is very cool...you'll see) Which brings me to the Scorpion Battle.  I see a lot of people labeling it as unnecessary.  I have one thing to say to all of you  You're correct! But it is very cool, gets you pumped, and does have significance. Let us assume the black scorpion is Kurt and the silver Kevin.  Just notice how the silver scorpion is killed.  With his own stinger being used by the black one right?!  Okay, flash forward to the end where Mr. Costner is stung by the black scorpion.   He is stung on his scorpion tattoo, right? Notice where.  Right in the middle of its stinger.  Not exactly sure what it means, but the filmmakers made it obvious where the blood was coming from to a such a degree that it has some meaning. Perhaps killed by his own aggressive behavior...I don't know and I'm not going to ponder over it any deeper.This is a guy flick through and through (although my wife enjoyed it) and there are moments to be liked.  Yes, it loses its pacing at times but its definitely worth a rental. For all you DVD owners out there...the transfer is great and the sound is IN YOUR FACE.  This is a great disc to put your 5.1 sound system to the test. Don't expect much in the way of special features but the price is not gonna break you; $14.99! I'm sure the majority will disagree with my review but hands-down, this movie is fun...don't take it too seriously.  It seems like everyone involved had a great time making it and expected those on the recieving end to feel the same while watching it.

It starts out with a raid gone wrong that is reminiscent of Heat, but this only sets the scene for a classic chase through the american southwest during which there is the usual twists and turns of cross, double-cross, like one expects it from Red Rock West or U-Turn, to name two films of the same genre.On a technical level, the movie is solid workmanship. The acting is good, which is no wonder considering the cast, actually, it surprised me that a movie like this was shot using actors of this magnitude - but then again, I can't come up with another recent movie that would have made better use of their talent. The photography is well done, even though there is little innovative about it, but overall, the movie succeeds in creating its own style. Fast cuts and faster-than-life speed up in the appropriate places, while jumps into slow-motion let other scenes sink in and give them a certain high-polished still look that is a bit 50ish in nature, fitting in very well with the theme. The only shortcoming is that at times, the movie falls into cheap action-flick style, with big explosions, big guns and surprisingly invincible heroes - the movie could have done without these over-used clichés.Summing up, this movie clearly is a B movie, but it's a good B movie and thus gets 8/10 from me, which is as high as I go for B movies.

I am a huge fan of both Kurt Russell and Kevin Costner so I was really anticipating this one for a while, particularly since the last time I saw Kurt Russell was over three years ago in Soldier (1998).The film starts out with a very entertaining and stylish action sequence involving the robbing of a casino during an Elvis convention.The rest of the film deals with the backstabbing that goes on between the crooks after the event. I think I would like to see another film by Demian Lichtenstein. He made a very entertaing movie. The action scenes are very exciting and are aided by one of the best soundtracks I have heard in a long time. This film has a great supporting cast including Howie Long who impressed me alot in Broken Arrow (1996) and Firestorm (1998). He is very good here, really funny. It also has Ice-T in his first theatrical release in like six years. He has been in about two dozen direct-to-video movies over the last three years. Did anybody see Leprechaun in the Hood (2000)? Believe it or not it wasn't that bad, but I was having a very good day when I saw it. Ice-T isn't in it that long, but he is also very funny.But the film has a few flaws. I felt that Courteney Cox's character came across like, sorry, a bit of a slut. Cox isn't even that great, during a scene when she is suppose to be upset it looks like shes smiling through the whole scene. It is a beautiful smile though. I also didn't get that whole thing about ***small warning, this next few lines may give away some of the plot when she runs off with the money she leaves her son with Russell, later she says she did it to help her because she can't can't raise her son by herself anymore. But how was she going to get her son back, it was never explained how they were planning on reuniting. It is a small thing but it bugged me.***Then there were all the small characters that pop up during Costner's road trip that don't proceed the plot at all and are a bit distracting. The girl he picks up at the Gas Station for example. I though maybe Costner was going to fall in love with her are something but then she leaves and thats it, shes gone. Then theres the redneck cop that Costner has the shootout with. It was a funny scene but think for a second. The scene was completely pointless. Also and it's a small thing but Kevin Costner is so good as the bad guy that he steals every scene he is in. Kurt Russell is the hero right, but you barely notice him. Kind of like in The Jackal (1997), Richard Gere was the star but you really kind of just cared about Bruce Willis.  All in all though, 3,000 Miles to Graceland is a very entertaining action packed film with a few minor flaws. But still a fun ride with a killer performance by Kevin Costner. I give it a solid 9/10.

Does it have the most engrossing plot? no. Are it's characters completely fleshed out? no. But who goes to an action film for those? You want good action and wonderful storytelling, go see Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. You want a fun, blood soaked, shoot em up where everyone gets what is coming to them in the end, then, this is the movie for you.Kevin Costner shows us that he can still put on an inspired performance with his psychotic Murph, Kurt Russell almost makes us forget Escape from LA and it's nice to see Courtney Cox putting some weight back on.The supporting cast did their jobs admirably (Kevin Pollack and Thomas Hayden Church were far too underutilized as the wisecracking federal Marshals) and the direction was very edgy and kept you enthralled. Yeah, all these critics lambast the quick, music video like cuts used, but I'll bet you they couldn't look away, for fear of missing the next cool thing to pop up.3000 Miles to Graceland is well worth the price of admission, and I could reccomend this to anyone looking for great action.

Unless you're a strict Merchant/Ivory snob, you will like or dislike any given movie based on what you think you'll get from it.  With that in mind, if you expect from this movie what I did, namely a light, goofy caper flick with Elvises (Elvii?) running around in sequins and C-drum M-16s, holding up a probably-Mob casino and saying Thankyew ver'amuch, you won't get it.  This movie is too earnest about blood and thunder to appreciate the levity of its own situation.  Although the Presley estate is thanked in the credits, this movie is about Elvis the way Dracula 2000 is about Bram Stoker.The plot, propelled by firepower and coincidence, is about a gang of ex-cons in King mufti who rob a Vegas casino, which contains exactly no mobsters but has a phalanx of the dumbest security guards of the 2001 movie season. Their take is $3.2 million, which won't even get a decent apartment these days, and what follows is a typical, if grim and somewhat mean-spirited, cross, doublecross, and triplecross as various characters abscond with the loot while fleeing to Canada (most movie fugitives go to Mexico; this is this movie's idea of originality).Director Demian Lichtenstein cut his teeth in music videos, and it shows. The credits contain a real video, of Such a Night (one of the surprisingly few Elvis tunes in the movie), wherein various cast members cavort in front of a Vegas blue-screen.  It's an odd counterpoint to the gruesome violence that went before, and Kurt Russell proves that he is the only one in the cast with any props as an Elvis impersonator.  In fact, that is how this movie is best enjoyed as a sort of surreal music video, full of sound and fury.The acting is good, if shallow.  I won't say Kevin Costner is any better here than as Eliot Ness or Robin Hood or a sensitized cavalry officer; it's just that a psychotic faux-Elvis suits his standard delivery well.  Kurt Russell once more carries more movie than he should have to.  Courteney Cox puts her best into her trailer-trash seductress, what passes for a love interest here.  Kevin Pollak and Thomas Haden Church have fun as two US Marshals trailing the crooks (why the Marshals and not the FBI is anyone's guess).  It would have been nice to see them more.  Everyone else is decent but perfunctory Christian Slater does his junior-Nicholson shtick, David Arquette his annoying shtick, Bokeem Woodbine his token-black-guy-dies-first shtick, Jon Lovitz his feckless sleaze shtick, Howie Long his laconic beefcake shtick.  There is a throwaway character right at the end, a one-man army of mass firepower and highly questionable tactics called Hamilton, who is never developed, and since he is played by Ice-T, that's just as well.Overall, the movie is entertaining, where many of its type are not.  The action scenes are exciting and handled well, although they unfortunately peak too early with the casino sequence, which might have made a better midpoint or climax.  Too little is made of the Elvis/Vegas milieu; the movie is too hot to dash to the border.  Flashy surrealism works with Vegas as a setting; they should have hung around longer.  The final confrontation has some moments (nice laser sight work, for instance), but it is another example of Hollywood's First Law of War any lead character standing still in the open, firing full-auto from the hip, is more than a match for 276 extras in full SWAT gear.What was really needed here (aside from more judicious editing) was a lightening of tone.  It took its own silly situation far more seriously than it had a right to.  The proper dose of irony would have helped this movie rise above its material, rather than sink under its own weight.  If you're going to go noir, do it right.  Otherwise, make a movie with some wit, some tongue-in-cheek, some ability to laugh at itself.You know, kind of like an Elvis movie.

These people need to stay home and continuously view the 5 films that they deem worthy of their time, and leave the theater to the rest of us more open minded movie buffs.First off, the opening credits of this film are nothing short of awesome!! It sets the tone for this off the wall action flick, lets the viewer know that this isn't going to be your usual cookie cutter 'lets follow the typical Hollywood action movie scenario'.Second, the soundtrack is nothing short of great! The tracks are perfectly placed with their scenes, and allows the film to flow great.Ok, so Kurt, and especially Kevin, may not have given their greatest performances, but come on! They played two low life redneck ex-cons, not college educated Federal agents. (And I've known some low life rednecks in my time, and Kevin Costner does a darn good job of playing one.)Bottom line is this If you like your movies with alot of action, and alot of gun play, AND you've got an open mind, you'll enjoy this one.

While there has been some debate over his death his memory will never die merchandising has continued unabated for the past two decades and there is a never-ending line of imitators of all creeds, colors, and sex. Long live the king.If you are an Elvis fanatic, look-alike and an ex-con, it makes sense to combine your talents.  For Murph and Michael that means taking down a casino in Vegas during the international Elvis convention while decked out in cape and rhinestones so as not to attract attention.  It is Vegas after all. However, money, especially $3 million tends to bring out the worst in people.  Elvis would have been so disappointed.I walked into 3000 Miles... with the simple expectation that it would be my popcorn movie for the month  I wasn't expecting in-depth plots, with clever twists, rather guns, buns, and fun.  From the bizarre introduction, and frantic photography I knew I was in for some fun.Instead of wasting precious screen time on pointless character development, the writers jump in feet first.   It was great to see Kurt Russel's tongue in cheek Elvis, especially if you remember his performance in the 1979 TV movie.  The boyish charm and winning smile that made him a Disney stalwart still shine.  His foil, the Evil Elvis if you will, is played to the hilt by Kevin-I-haven't-had-a-decent-role-in-ages-Costner, who has a lot of fun with his character.   He doesn't have to worry about sounding ridiculous, because he's supposed to.   I was also taken with Courtney Cox-Arquette who plays a fast talking temptress and was especially happy to see that she has abandoned that hideous stick look (she looked positively ghastly in Scream 3).There isn't a whole lot that can be said for the story except that it is totally unbelievable, full of double dealing and dirty pool, and is punctuated with explosions and gunfights.  Although the film does drag at points, especially in the last half-hour (which gets overly sappy), the gunplay soon resumes.  There is even a tantalizingly ambiguous ending. Oh, and I enjoyed the soundtrack - rather than filling it with Elvis tunes (the Elvis impersonator hired to amuse the audience before the premiere more than made up for this) it samples many different types of music.Critics, naysayers and plot be damned, this is my guilty pick for a mindless matinee.

There are lots of things in it that refer to Elvis, his movies, his life and his legendary persona. If you love Elvis, then this movie will be kind of a cult film for you, a bit like Rocky Horror or Eraserhead. The fact that it is corny, over the top and ridiculous will only enhance you enjoyment, If you are not into Elvis, if you could care less, the flaws in the film may be too much to for you. Most of the actors are quite good, striking the right note of insanity and self parody that is needed to make the film work. The only exception is Costner. He works at it, but he tries too hard. It isn't natural with him and you can sense the effort in his acting. It isn't terrible but compared to Kurt Russell and Cortney Cox, he is outclassed.Also trying too hard is the script. While it does have its moments, such as the performance of What a Night during the shoot out in the beginning, but there are too many times it is just straining to be cool or for a laugh. As cult films go, it is not bad, but it is not one of the best. But none of this will bother you if you love Elvis. There enough good things here to make any Elvis fan happy. So enjoy.

The premise of an Elvis-themed casino robbery was just too much on which to pass up, and the casual moviegoer could see how a talented director could turn it into worthy cinematography. Unfortunately, this film just didn't work. What we get instead is a dime-a-dozen shoot-em-up film with jilted acting, dialog that read like a seventh grader's English project, and a story that leaves audiences scratching their heads wondering vaguely, Who cares? The opening sequences aren't interesting, and while the film does have it's decent parts roughly halfway through, by the end, you're just glad it's over. The surprise twist at the end of the film was both predictable and poorly executed, and had absolutely no emotional impact on the film whatsoever. I suppose they just needed to close it out somehow, in which case, it works. Almost.Bottom line if you're looking for a standard guy movie, there are better ones out there.

The only truly bad movies I have ever seen him associated with was TANGO & CASH and VANILLA SKY, and the latter is easy enough to dismiss because he does not have a major role in it. Anyhow, a bunch of self-styled Elvis impersonators come to Vegas to rob a casino, and the aftermath is one big bloody mess. Costner plays the head bad guy who will let no one get in the way of his objective, and he stinks up the screen every second he is on it. Russell is the sympathetic bad guy who wouldn't hurt a soul, and since we already associate him with Elvis, thanks to his classic TV movie ELVIS, we can afford to cut him a little slack.

A low-brow plot with a high concept hook (robbers dressed as Elvis impersonators rob Vegas casino), a cast littered with not quite A listers and one arguably former A lister (that being, of course, Kevin Costner), and lots of eccentricity. When all is said in done, however, what you are left with is all of the guilt and none of the pleasure.3000 Miles to Graceland opens at a hotel in the Nevada desert, where recently released con Michael Zane (Kurt Russell) is planning to hook up with old cell-mate Thomas J. Murphy (Costner) and a small crew to pull a heist at a major Vegas casino, all dressed as Elvis impersonators. At the hotel, Michael meets and promptly has sex with down-on-her-luck single mom Cybil (Courtney Cox) who's son as kleptomaniac fever, stealing anything he can get his hands on and hiding it in the ceiling above their hotel room (and it is one big hotel room). During the heist, things go badly and one of the crew dies. When the remaining group meets to split up the loot, Hanson (Christian Slater) has disagreements as to the percentages with one member of the group gone, leading Murphy to cut his losses and shoot everybody else. Michael, wearing a bullet proof vest, survives the betrayal, and with Cybil and her son in tow, attempts to outrun Murphy to the money launderer (Jon Lovitz) who will clean the cash and allow Michael to live the rest of his life free and clear.There isn't really a shred of originality in 3000 Miles to Graceland. This is one of those films that was financed because Pulp Fiction hit it off big and everybody and his brother in Hollywood was scrambling to assemble a hip, flashy criminal picture. The film Graceland mostly resembles is another Quentin Tarantino penned epic, True Romance, with it's story of crooks on the road being chased by feds after coming into a lot of cash. Unfortunately, Graceland does very little to warrant being an entertaining two hours. The film is rather predictable, little happens here that is not telegraphed several steps ahead, and when the film tries to be offbeat, it ends up just being ridiculous. What we are left with is a rather monotonous experience that, frankly drags on quite a few minutes longer than it should have (at an hour and a half, Graceland could be a brisk experience, at two hours, it's almost unbearable).None of the characters are developed to any degree, and they are pretty much all types. Michael is an ex-con with a soft heart just trying to get clean, Murphy is your usual uncaring, everybody for himself villain (although there are a few moments that take the character out of type, but they are few and far between) who will kill anyone in his way. Aside from Cybil, who is left almost completely undeveloped, the rest of the cast is just here to collect a paycheck for a handful of scenes. Thomas Hayden Church and Kevin Pollack show up as federal agents here and there and almost sleepwalk through their roles, which barely integrate with the rest of the film.The only aspect of the film to still warrant a guilty pleasure status is the performance of Kevin Costner as Murphy. Equipped with outrageous sideburns, black leather and rarely going a few moments without lighting up a cigarette, Costner chews scenery with abandon and when he is on screen, Graceland manages to be entertaining in fits and starts. However, with the film's length, even this aspect wears thin after a while. Russell is adequate, but hardly standout as Michael, and Courtney Cox does nothing to display why she is a television star in her thankless role as the girl. The rest of the actor breeze through so quickly, it wouldn't matter if they were names or not.There are some who will probably see 3000 Miles to Graceland and still consider it a guilty pleasure, if nothing else than from Costner's performance alone. However, everything surrounding that one aspect proves to be unentertaining in the extreme, and so 3000 Miles to Graceland just ends up an empty two hours at the movies.

A (possibly) illegitimate son of Elvis goes and robs a casino with his partners in crime, things turn sour shortly afterwards, and it turns into a virtual hunt between two groups. We've seen similar premises in The Terminator or The Bourne Identity, without the Elvis connection, so what stopped them from making this one consistently entertaining?In a nutshell, it all went south when the makers couldn't decide what the film wanted to be. According to the trivia, two cuts were assembled according to the wishes of its principal stars. One was more focused on the relationship between two characters, the other emphasising the action. The problem here is that after watching the film from start to finish, it is difficult to tell which of the cuts won out. Sure, there is action aplenty, but when Russell's character is having his bonding moments with a snotty kid and his mother, the film comes to a grinding halt. If Kurt Russell's preferred version of the film is the one I saw, then it's a good argument for actors not being allowed to influence how their films are cut. If Kevin Costner won the battle, well, he's Kevin Costner. Need I say more?There isn't much else to say about the film because there is really quite little to it. Like Return Of The King or Van Helsing, the film really seems to want to impress the viewer with results while not bothering with setup. No emotional connection with any of the characters is allowed, and given that the two principals spend a significant amount of time involved in the murder of hotel staff or patrons, this is a hurdle that no action film can overcome. We know no more about Russell's character in the end than we do in the beginning, and while Russell's easy-going charm makes him watchable, I'm sure he'd be the first to tell you that asking an actor to perform under these conditions is something no competent director would do.Normally, it is easy to blame Kevin Costner for turning out another dud film. Being the driving force behind a film that cost hundreds of millions to shoot on location when it could have been done for tens in the studio, and turning out as a bad Mad Max ripoff at that, carries a heavy stigma. But in this case, Costner would be getting a bum rap. The reality is that the blame for this monstrosity extends in so many direction it's hard to pin it to any particular source. Even Ice-T, a man who should be grateful for any acting assignment he gets, seemed to want to be somewhere else. One can only wonder where the money used to film this turkey went. Perhaps the Presley estate smelt this one coming, and decided to gouge it for all it was worth.In all, I have to give this one a three out of ten. I'd normally give it a one, but in light of all the films with action scenes where one cannot tell what the hell is going on because of all the extraneous camera movement, the casino shootout is worth two bonus points. If you're desperate to see a good action scene, rent this to see that sequence. Otherwise, don't bother.

In this movie, it is mentioned once in a while but it is really not annoying or more present as in other movies nowadays. If you like Ocean's Eleven, The way of the Gun and A perfect world, then you are definitely going to like this one.

He is undoubtedly the most under-rated actor in Hollywood.  Second, there have been some major oversimplifications in previous comments on what a good action movie is.  Action movies do not require a plot.  If they did, then all movies by John Woo, Jackie Chan, Silvester Stalone, and all of Oliver Stones action movies, would have sank into oblivion.  A good action movie is all about how it's done.  And the film _3,000 Miles to Graceland_ is a perfect example of how an action film is supposed to be done. Now, obviously the director has studied the masters like John Woo.  A lot of Woo's inspiration came from Westerns, and much of that is seen in this film.  The stylized violence in this film is the best I've seen since Pulp Fiction, and I probably won't see it this good again for a few years at the least. Let's start from the beginning.  The film starts with two computer-generated scorpions fighting.  You see them using wrestling moves, martial arts, and even some Matrix-style combat.  This ends with one of the scorpions dramatically stabbing the other with his stinger.  When I saw this scene, I knew this wouldn't be any ordinary film.  Since I didn't know much about the film beforehand, I didn't know what to expect. The introduction of Costner's character, Murphy, was quite dramatic.  A gradual swoop from above to show him stepping out of the car in a sweet pair of shades.  He and Russel's character reunite, and they drive off into the desert with a plan for a heist.  Up to this point, I expected this to be a somewhat cute heist/comedy movie. The plan four of the guys, including Murphy, sneak into the counting room of a huge casino disguised as Elvis impersonators at a convention and rob the place at gunpoint, while Russel's character provides a getaway elevator to the rooftop where a helicopter picks them up.  Very sweet plan.  However, they then walked through the casino brandishing their assault rifles, and the dazed security guards tried to stop them.  And here's the point at which I realized this was going to be a bloody, gruesome, violent film.  Murphy raises his shotgun and blows a cop across the casino.  There's a moment of silence, then the whole casino erupts into the bloodiest battle since Gettysburg.  And this was one of the best filmed action sequences I've ever seen.  It switches frequently between the gunfight, and an Elvis impersonator singing on stage.  Very interesting technique.  This is an EXTREMELY violent scene, but it's very well orchestrated.  In fact, it's a beautiful scene because it's shot so well. Later, Murphy gets into an absolutely stupid argument with Slater's character about whether they should split up their dead comrade's money. Murphy ends up using a gun under the table to shoot him in the knee.  He then walks over and blows his brains out.  When Murphy then shoots his other two partners, it's obvious that the argument was just an excuse.  And that scene in the motel room where Murphy shot Slater, was the best execution scene I've seen since Hard-Boiled.From that point on, the movie just gets more and more evil, and that's what makes it great.  The film has such great stylized violence, and it holds back nothing.  Murphy, driving through the desert, stops at a gas station. Not wanting to pay for the gas, he kills the fat, bald gas station attendant, who was incestuous with his daughter (or maybe grand daughter). The girl is shocked, but asks to come with Murphy.  So he takes her with him.  Later, you see Murphy driving alone in the car.  There's no one in the passenger seat.  Then you see the girl's head pop up, and she wipes her mouth.  Disgusting, gritty, reality. This movie, though it may seem far-fetched, is actually realistic.  Gas station attendants getting shot; happens all the time.  A guy with a girl's head in his lap doing you-know-what; this happens in real life.  But this film doesn't hold these things back.  It includes it all in this masterpiece of stylized violence. (MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD)  At the end, Murphy is cornered in a large warehouse by at least 50 heavily armed cops.  You think, There's no way they can win this one. Surprisingly, Murphy whips out a machine gun and starts shooting.  This shootout between Murphy, his boys, and the cops, may have broken John Woo's record for the most bullets in an action movie.  Murphy's guys die pretty quickly, and he ends up with 20 cops aiming assault rifles right at his chest.  He freezes, and looks at all the red dots dancing around on his chest.  He has a little moment of deep thought, and maybe prayer, then raises his M-60 and starts shooting.  The cops blow him to oblivion, absolutely riddling his body with bullets. All in all, this movie is a masterpiece of stylized violence.  It has superb acting; I've never seen Costner play someone so evil.  The action scenes almost rival those of Woo and the Chinese Masters.  And something to keep in mind even my mother loved this movie. I give it 9 out of 10 stars.

It's shallow, it's gratuitously violent, it's riddled with four-letter words at every twist and turn, the plot is paper-thin, but guess what?  It works.  And it makes a great popcorn flick!!!The only mild disappointment I had was the fact that the trailers were a little misleading.  I expected the whole movie to be about the four guys rushing into the casino, dressed in Elvis suits and trying to get away clean.  That pretty much describes the first 20 minutes.  The rest of the film revolves around greed, in splitting the stolen money up and keeping a bigger share for themselves by trying to eliminate the others in the equation.  I just felt the movie had a catchy, original premise.  I am not a huge Elvis fan, but I am appreciative of his work and persona.  So I expected the film to have lots of references to The King, and lots of his greatest hits in the soundtrack.  I thought that hopped up dance remix to Viva Las Vegas they played in the previews was really cool, and that was one of the things that subliminally hypnotized me into seeing it.I wish people will leave poor Kevin Costner alone.  Sure, he's made Waterworld, The Postman and For Love of the Game.  And I'm not going to change my mind purposely and say they were, in fact, good movies.  But that doesn't make Kevin a bad actor.  I still think he's very talented. Anybody who's seen Bull Durham or Dances with Wolves (and there's a lot more to add to the list) knows that's true.  I think he looked really cool with the Elvis sideburns and the cigarette constantly hanging out his mouth. I don't condone smoking; I just think he makes it look cool.  That's not going to rope me into lighting up, though.  Costner is great at playing against typecast as an unscrupulous, take-no-crap villain.  At times he doesn't even seem to have a conscience.  Not that I can compare myself to him, but I enjoyed his character.  I liked the shoot-out between him and the cop, who pulled him over.  It was like a slick contemporary update of those patented gunfights in the old westerns.  It was very well done.  And he has some awesome lines in the movie, too.  I liked the scene between him and Christian Slater, where he says  You know what I say about the Golden Rule--F**k the Golden Rule!  Then he pulls a gun out from under the table and shoots him.  I hope I didn't give anything away.  But seeing that Slater has bottom billing, I'm pretty sure it's evident that he won't be in the film for long.The casino heist was well done.  I liked how they continually cut--with lightning-fast editing--from the robbery to the Elvis impersonator surrounded by an array of showgirls.  Even when this film gets really preposterous, there's never a dull moment.  And that's what I loved about it!If you're looking for something deep and philosophical--this is not the movie to see.  This is strictly a popcorn flick that will--probably--appeal mostly to guys.  But I enjoyed it a lot.  And I hope others will, too. Just please please please please please don't take it seriously!

The group implodes on itself leaving just Murphy and Zane to battle over the money. Along the way, Michael does some torrid mattress dancing with an alluring Cybil with a C (Courtney Cox). The finale is just as loud and bloody as the robbery almost two hours earlier.Expecting a charming movie about a group of guys that like to play dress up as Elvis is at least 3,000 miles from what you get. The King himself liked things a little gaudy; this movie is gaudy in over drive. He may have liked the blazing gunfire; but would probably roll over in his grave with the soundtrack. Instead of striking gold with rockin' Elvis tunes, what is chosen is metal/head-bangin'/rap from the likes of Filter, Spineshank, Bender, Crystal Method and George S. Clinton. We do hear bits and pieces of a few Elvis rockers and during the credits Russell resurrects his acclaimed Elvis portrayal lip synching the smash hit Such A Night.Costner fans might be shaking their heads for awhile wondering why Kevin took this part. Talk about a ruthless bad ass. Russell is by far the likable bad guy. This is the best performance I have seen Cox put on film.

Who know my opinion of the film might have changed, but after watching it again it hasn't. It's just a terrible movie. This will be one of my shorter reviews and there I think will be some spoilers, but I don't care since this is just a terrible film.The story revolves around a group of bank robbers (Kurt Russell, Kevin Costner, Christian Slater, David Arquette and Bokeem Woodbine) dress up as Elvis's and rob a Las Vegas Casino. Things go wrong when Woodbine (Franklin) is shot by police and security. The four remaining robbers escape by helicopter with the help of Jack (Howie Long). The four head back to their run down motel outside Vegas to sort their shares, but Murphy (Costner) as other plans as he shots and kills Gus (Arquette), Hanson (Slater) and believes he's also killed Michael (Russell) who was wearing a vest. From there on it's a race to get the money as Cybil Waingrow (Courteney Cox) and her son get mixed up with it along with two US Marshal's (Thomas Haden Church, Kevin Pollak).The bad story was bad enough, but adding in uninteresting and uninteresting characters and you've got a terrible film. Russel's character was supposed to play the good guy as he had a conscience, but that doesn't take away that his character is about as interesting and likable as a rock you have to stare at four hours kind of like this film. Costner playing the bad guy seemed not to want to be in this awful film. He probably was wondering when his career took a downward turn. It was just a few years ago he was starring in films like A PERFECT WORLD, ROBIN HOOD PRINCE OF THIEVES, JFK and THE BODY GUARD. I think his career took a turn with WATERWORLD and THE POSTMAN. Waterworld wasn't good, but it's not as bad as people make it out to be, especially if you watch the extended edition. The Postman in my opinion is a good film, but not great. Still neither were box office hits and his career started to go downward until he relegated to star in crappy heist films like this one. The most interesting and fun characters are the the supporting characters. Howie Long the ex-NFL player turned analysis and actor was having a fun time with this film as he had no pressure on him. Also Thomas Haden Church and Kevin Pollak seemed to have good chemistry as partners and to be honest I was rooting for them to kill all the bank robbers including Russel's character.You'd expect the action to be good in a heist film. Now I wasn't expecting great action like HEAT that was just a special film, but I was expecting to be entertained. I wasn't and outside of the beginning action scene in the casino which was decent it was all bad. Even the climax in a warehouse was a let down. There's lots of blame to go around for the lack of good action, you could blame the studio Warner Brothers for this, but I don't. I think the WB gave up on this film after they saw it, and if I remember it right there wasn't a lot of promotion for this film. You could just tell WB had no confidence in this film. No I blame the director Demian Lichtenstein who also co-wrote this piece of crap. Apparently Demian was a big music video director, but had only directed one feature film before this one called Lowball, and I had to look it up to find out that it was a direct to VHS film. Maybe I should blame WB for hiring this guy to write and direct a feature film, because he's terrible.Overall 3000 Miles to Graceland is a terrible film and as bad a I remember it. If you haven't seen this film avoid it at all costs. It will drain away months of your life.

There was some good action, drama, and suspense. Then that all went away. The movie went soft in my opinion. It lost its grit and its edge. Sure, Kostner's character provided a very sinister and ruthless bad guy (very good character and very good job by Kostner I might add), but the movie spiraled out of control by adding secondary characters to muck up the plot. If the movie had finished half as decent as it begun, then I would have been able to finish watching it and give it maybe a six or seven rating.

Thus it is an action movie, a suspense-packed thriller, almost a gangster comedy and a drama which is both serious and then again not to be taken seriously at the same time. David Kaye is awesome, his part is very witty and an exact compound of all the elements mentioned above. He is sincere and genuine in the serious parts, which is especially obvious throughout the evolving father-son relationship with Kurt Russell's character. Then again he is brilliant in the funny sequences. Just think of the scene in which he shows his guns to Kevin Costner with this firm Jesse-James-will-kill-ya glance, or when he reacts so swiftly when the cops arrive at their bungalow in order to have the money hidden and Kurt Russell sitting next to him in front of the TV. That's awesome acting! Still some sequences are exaggeratedly staged, as I don't think a boy of about 10 years would go into the room where his mom is having sex as if it were nothing at all. The cast is great, almost breathtaking. I mean how many movies feature Kevin Costner, Kurt Russell, Christian Slater, Ice-T and Courteney Cox? The plot is thrilling and has hardly any pauses. The Elvis reference is very inventive and adds a very funny and glitzy element to the story. It's both sincere and entertaining, so... a very good movie!

I was surprised by Kevin Costners part in this. I've seen him in quite a few films like 'JFK', 'The Untouchables', 'Dances With Wolves', and 'Wyatt Earp', and I must say, this was a 'step to the side' role for him.Another thing that surprised me was the film's distribution. I would've expected the robbery to be a lot later in the film, instead of right at the beginning.

Still today though, his legacy lives on. With obsessive fans in suits around the globe, re-released singles in the British music charts and a multi-million dollar fortune spread between relatives, Elvis is a phenomenon. Using this obsession to original effect, 3000 Miles to Graceland is a violent, action movie with some fun moments which revolves around two 'bad' men with a link to the King.Released from prison Michael Zane (Kurt Russell) unites with his former inmate friend Thomas J Murphy (Kevin Costner) to rob a casino. Escaping with the money, Zane and Murphy find themselves constantly doing battle over the finances whilst single mother Cybil Waingrow (Courteney Cox) and her son Jesse (David Kaye) are stuck in the cross fire.Against regular casting as a gun toting villain, Kevin Costner is a surprisingly success in this film. With a menacing stare, he is superb as he travels around America slaughtering people and causing carnage, all in the pursuit of his money. Costner can often infuriate in his work and whilst the final ten minutes of his character are difficult to fully comprehend (a suitable analogy of the obscurity would be Paris Hilton playing a Catholic Nun), he is mostly brilliant in this film.Costner isn't alone as performing well in 3000 Miles to Graceland. As 'not so bad' bad guy Zane, Kurt Russell provides a suitably solid, moody performance as he begins to embrace the apparent family placed in front of him. In these roles too, Courteney Cox and David Kaye are well cast and surprisingly good.Perhaps the one minor flaw with casting, and this isn't as such a flaw as a disappointment, is the limited time Christian Slater's character is on screen. Slater is one of those strange actors that you know can perform well and who can always entertain, but who sometimes can grate on you. In 3000 Miles to Graceland he is a bit of a mixture really. Playing a character that only he can really play, Slater's brief appearance is annoying both in that he occasionally frustrates and that you feel the character can develop more before his untimely demise.Aside from acting, this film also thrives on some brilliant camera work. With so much action taking place at times, it would be so easy for the footage to be awkward and incomprehensible. In fact the film is shot marvellously with every piece of action being easy to understand and the audience never missing a thing.Truthfully, there is perhaps one major flaw with this film and that is it's soundtrack. It's not difficult to see why the creators of this film would choose NOT to use Elvis for every single scene. Whether you love 'The King' or not, films like this don't work with non-stop Elvis tracks. As an alternative though, there are certainly options. What shouldn't be used though is the nu-metal stuff that this film uses far too often. With tracks by Linkin Park to name one, far too often the films music is completely inappropriate for the plot and it just lowers the tone of the film from being a serious, entertaining, action film into some sort of cheap explosives flick. Music is never everything, but it can often be an integral part. In 3000 Miles to Graceland the creators got that aspect badly wrong.As far as your typical gun driven heist film, 3000 Miles to Graceland is an impressive attempt. Led by solid performances by Kurt Russell and Kevin Costner, it entertains throughout and provides enough action to keep everyone happy. Unfortunately though, the soundtrack is so completely inappropriate at times, that you find yourself feeling angry with whoever chose it. The film itself is good, but it's music leaves something to be desired.

Not many. I like a lot of Costner's movies, but he's often the weakest link. The only performance I can think of that was this good was in A Perfect World. Maybe he should play bad guys more often.I say that he just about steals the show, because he's playing opposite Kurt Russell, and in a movie that relies greatly on the larger-than-life persona of Elvis Presley as an underlying influence, Russell should know better than anyone how to bring that to milk that for what it's worth.The story isn't terribly original, but it does a fair job of keeping the audience in check with some pretty violent action, a few interesting twists, and some unexpected humor, a reminder that what we're seeing is supposed to be fun, and not terribly deep.We start when Michael Zane (Russell) pulls into a roadside motel in Nevada. The New Jersey drifter immediately makes friends with the proprietor, Cybill, (Courtney Cox) and before you know it the two are in bed. What he doesn't know is her son, Jessie, the little thief that he is, is snooping around the room. It's not so much important what he takes at this point, as that he is a compulsive thief.Then up rides Thomas Murphy (Costner) and Zane's other cohorts (Christian Slater, David Arquette, Bokeem Woodbine). They're here for a reason. There's a casino in Vegas they plan to knock over. Murphy's partner, a helicopter pilot (Howie Long), supplies them with guns in flashy cases, and they descend upon the casino in Elvis attire, to mix in with the other fans who are there to celebrate the King's birthday. Although the initial money heist is pulled off without a problem, they encounter problems with security on the way out. Guns blaze, men in uniform fall. On the roof, they lose one of their own.The plan was to visit a man (Jon Lovitz) to clean the money, since otherwise they can be traced back to the robbery. What no one but Zane seems to know, is that Murphy is a psychopath, and his plan was to kill the all and take the money for himself.Cybill rejoins the story when she and Jesse steal the money from a storage space above Zane's room. With only Zane and Murphy left, the money in Cybill's hands, and Jesse in Zane's, the fun has just started, as U.S. Marshals get involved in the chase, a gunslinger State Trooper is shot, and the chase goes as far east as Boise, and as far west as Mt. Vernon, all for the sake of money and a few thrills.Kevin Costner exudes a psychosis I never knew him capable of, Kurt Russell is on familiar territory, Courtney Cox is cute, corny, and good comic relief, and a bevy of other stars are killed off without a second thought. The opening scene of two scorpions dueling it out has some metaphorical significance, but they are so obviously computer animated, almost like characters in some Saturday morning action cartoon, that the scene really didn't need to be there. It's a movie for people who enjoy popcorn action and fans of those actors. But don't see this one if you have an adversion to violence.

After the beginning of the movie almost all of the entertainment value of the movie goes down the drain and the movie becomes nothing more than just another average genre piece, in which a couple of thieves constantly chase- and steal from each other, with all of the usual twists, confrontations and action.The cast isn't too surprising. Kurt Russell, Kevin Costner and Christian Slater are about the three best known actors in the business that are Elvis fans. They played in many Elvis Presley related movies before and in some cases the actual person. It does is surprising how big the cast is and how many big names are in it. Courteney Cox, Kevin Pollak, David Arquette, Jon Lovitz, Thomas Haden Church. It's the sort of movie that makes you wonder why all these actors actually agreed to be in this. Courteney Cox was surprisingly good and shows that she can handle different and more carrying and serious roles. Also good to see Kevin Costner in a more villainous role for a change but its not like he shines in it. Ice-T makes a fun cameo but problem with it is that in his cameo he is being treated as a big star, which he of course isn't. It's as if his cameo is supposed to be the ultimate highlight of the movie.Even though the movie is fast cut and has a high pace, the movie still feels overlong and not really that thrilling or exciting. This is because there is basically very little good or interesting ever happening into the movie. Its moments are too predictable.I think I can say that Elvis himself also wouldn't had been too happy with this movie. It prominently features his character, impersonators and his music but it at the same time is a movie that glorifies violence. Seems like the Elvis-link was the only put into the movie to grab the audience attention and make this movie seem different and more special than just any other genre movie.It has it decent moments, which still help to make this movie a sort of watchable one but it at the same time also features some incredibly bad and disjointed storytelling, with moments in it that in the end just don't make sense or even seem redundant. There also are perhaps a bit too many characters and story lines that just don't interest or work out the way they were supposed to. The ambition during the making of this movie was definitely there but the execution of it all and the eventually end result is just below par.5/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"A Very Original Movie","Date":"26 January 2006","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":" This movie is really original and it contains nice humor and the whole movie is well worth watching, the Elvis things are well worked into it and the action is also like it should be, the movie also has a great ending.You can see that the actors (thoroughly) enjoyed making this movie, Kurt Russel and the others did a good job., i like this film very much and i give it a 8 out of 10 rating, i think it's a great movie that has the right ingredients.They all stayed cool, and because everything has a original twist to it, the whole movie is very enjoyable.This movie is really different than most of the other movies.

I liked the acting of Kurt Russell, Kevin Costner, Courteney Cox and the boy who played her son, but I felt that the shootouts in the casino and at the end were gratuitously violent, prolonged, and implausible (security people and law enforcement people rush out to get blown away, while the gangsters, without all that much cover, remain totally invulnerable for a very long time - shades of the Wild Bunch) and that other elements were, to say the least, dubious (wouldn't the fence played by Jo Lovitz have some heavy protection for all that money? Wouldn't the Twin Falls shootout with a policeman raise an alarm?). Kevin Costner portrayed a totally amoral and ruthless man who kills his way out of almost everything well, but this is not new, cf. James Spader in Two Days in the Valley. Overall, not too satisfying, despite Courteney Cox, looking gorgeous.

Well I hate Marmite and I can truly say that this movie makes me think of Marmite or at least a word that rhymes with it.What a complete load of tosh this is. I have in the past failed to understand why Kevin Costner should have come under so much criticism for some of his past movies. Waterworld springs to mind which I thought wasn't that bad. Now I understand. I am surprised anybody bothered to learn their lines for this garbage. Come to think of it I don't think they did.Costner looks like an overstuffed penguin in a rubber suit auditioning for the part of the villain in a new Batman movie. That is about as funny as this movie comes........What's that, It's meant to be serious!Best line in the movieQuestion What,s that? Answer It's an African Piece.

While waiting for him to show he hooks up with single mother Cybil and her annoying little thieving b*stard of a son Jesse &#150; but the sex is good at least. When Thomas and others turn up they head into Vegas to join in with the annual Elvis convention, however their aim is not to celebrate the singer but to rob the casino. One bloodbath later and the crew are out and running but, when Thomas kills them all and leaves them for dead before crashing his car on the way back to get the cash. In this time Michael (who was wearing a vest) has managed to get back before him and, reluctantly taking Cybil and Jesse along, has fled with the cash. The chase is on and betrayal is never far away.I wanted to watch this film because it looked like it would be different enough to stand out from the crowd, however, beyond the superficial trimmings this is an average film in an overworked genre and it adds nothing to it. You can see what it was trying to do, come off cooler-than-cool as is the requirement of this type of film, but it only manages this in the early stages, after that it just becomes a mix of the usual violent betrayal and drama. Sadly it never really engages in the way that it should have done as it lacks a consistent tension in the action sequences and the supposed relationship between Cybil, Jesse and Michael is just weak and totally unconvincing. It is a shame because at times you can see it straining to be cool, different and pop-culture style but it doesn't pull it of even if it does enough to distract viewers who are forgiving fans of the genre.The cast try hard and the fault lies more with the material and the delivery rather than their performances. Russell is interesting but his criminal is unconvincing &#150; strangely shocked by the violent streak of his supposed long time friend, and he cannot do much more with it (although he always makes a good Elvis). With his career in the state its in, Costner really had nothing to lose in playing a baddie; he seems to have fun but he played it much better in A Perfect Day than he does here. Cox comes across as pretty sexy when required to, but she cannot make sense of her own character and she plays it all on the surface as a result. Kaye is annoying throughout and is a fine example of why child actors really should have to go through many, many auditions before getting any part. Slater, Arquette and Woodbine all add the feeling of depth even if they only have small roles in reality. Pollack and Church were pretty amusing but the film doesn't give them enough time to work with and they feel rather cut off. Cameos from Lovitz, Ice-T and Long don't add much but they are interesting anyway.Overall this is an average genre picture that, despite the appearance of pop-culture cool, really is just run-of-the-mill stuff. After the opening 20 minutes it never really gels, with the relationship section of it falling almost totally flat and preventing the story picking up any speed or tension. Undemanding genre fans will get something from it but most viewers will be left rather cold by it.

Films such as 3000 Miles To Graceland make me question the screenwriters ability to come up with an entertaining script. Two hours of non-stop gratuitous action and four high profile actors cannot make up for the lacking elements of 3000 Miles To Graceland. This film fails to reach the potential it had with the original concept.There is nothing new about 3000 Miles To Graceland because a similar plot was created to entertain audiences a year earlier called Reindeer Games. Since I enjoyed Reindeer Games, I thought I would enjoy this film; however, I was sorely disappointed to learn that this movie was nothing more than four men with a desire to play dress up in Elvis costumes. If I wanted to see Elvis impersonators, I would travel to Memphis during the time of year the Elvisa convention is held.The biggest problem I found with 3000 Miles To Graceland was understanding the reason why this film was made. Four men parading around in Elvis costumes is so uninteresting I felt like walking out of the theater and asking for my money back; something I rarely find myself doing. Another problem I had was the lack of focus and commitment showed by the actors. With each passing scene, it became painfully obvious that the actors were more interested in the concept of prancing around in costumes playing cowboys and indians.Though there was a plot somewhere scattered among this mess; however, I failed to see the connection and relevance of most of the scenes. The scenes seemed to be slapped together and forced for the purpose of making another Elvis film. If I earned a nickel each time I pointed out an irrelevant scene, the bank would go broke and I would be a rich man.Costner has been one of my favorite actors since I was a kid. Field Of Dreams marked the first time I saw this tremendous talent at work and I knew he had the ability to draw the audience into the film. Since this release of this film, Costner's career has been a roller coaster. With box office failures such as Waterworld and successes such as Dances With Wolves, he has proven he is only human. So, when the outcome of this film was revealed it came as no shock because Costner was as flat as a one dollar bill. Most of his films have been character-driven, thought-provoking or a movie that brought out emotions. 3000 Miles To Graceland is Costner's first film that truly disappointed me. As much as it pains me, I can't recommend this film to my friends because. 3000 Miles To Graceland is a flat, one-dimensional and disorganized film that contains more negatives than positives. I can't believe so many fine actors signed on to participate in this atrocious film.On the other hand, Russell stars in his worst movie since Soldier. His character and performance is flat as cardboard and extremely one-dimensional. It hurts to see an actor who has had a successful movie career make a huge mistake choosing to make this movie. I could only wish and hope he can rebound from this movie and get on track once again.3000 Miles To Graceland is far from its destination and drives itself into the ground as it strives to entertain viewers. Even with the firepower of Kevin Costner and Kurt Russell, 3000 Miles To Graceland could not overcome its over-glorification of Elvis Presley. Two Thumbs way down. 3000 Miles To Graceland has joined movies such as All The Pretty Horses, American Beauty and Battlefield Earth to share the honor being called the worst of the worst. "}]
