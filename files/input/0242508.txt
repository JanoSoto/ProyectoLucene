Interspersed with these things are characters tripping on drugs or philosophizing as college freshmen do, at great length.Leading man Adrian Grenier has gotten handsomer since he made this movie; he grew into his looks. He did a good job acting, especially considering how young he appears to be here and the oddness of the material.I was expecting the movie to be more offensive because the director has a reputation for doing unspeakable things to females in life, and given his other movies. This movie just appears to be a drug-fueled, delusional, freshman fantasy, but not as enjoyable as that sounds.The fact that this director was given several movies to direct after this, each more offensive than the next, is disturbing.Notes for the sensitive The movie opens with footage from a sex scene and there are several more throughout.

I really like morality tales but I feel a bit ripped when the ending doesn't end with a crash and burn (much like Risky Business or The Graduate). What does save this movie is the first ninety percent of it. Here are my reasons (some spoilers contained within) (1) I loved the sharp dialogue in this movie. Some of the lines that I heard throughout the film I will probably remember for quite sometime. (2) Adrien Grenier's performance was excellent and the best in the film. Seeing him go through that acid trip was enough for me to recommend him for an acting award. The words Oscar Clip should have been blinking at the bottom of the screen. (3) Sarah Michelle Gellar was enticingly evil as Grenier's boyfriend. Even her alter-ego would probably want to stab a stake in her heart. (4) The acid trip sequence is about as messed up as any sequence I have ever seen in a movie. As I saw Eric Stoltz's face become visually distorted, I felt like I had dropped acid myself. (5) The philosophical value in this movie is about as heavy as gold. I love it when movies inject philosophy into the plot of a film because the film is then acknowledging that something is supposed to be learned by watching it and therefore it isn't stupid. Most mass-produced movies don't have this phenomenon. (6) The most surprising aspect of the movie goes to Al Franken. He is the last person that I would ever expect to do a cameo in the movie and I don't think his talent was wasted or misplaced. (7) This is the second movie I have ever seen by James Toback and I found his style of filmmaking to be an acquired taste (much like that of Paul Thomas Anderson). He did a splendid job directing this movie however. (8) I found the choppy cinematography to a blessing. If the cinematography hadn't matched the somewhat choppy story to begin with, it would have sank even farther in my mind. Eight reasons give a score of eight.The downers I thought were (1) the choppy editing and (2) that sad excuse for a denouement and I believe they are interlocked. Granted the editing was rather sub-par I believe, it was needed to accomodate the screenplay. In order not to blow anything at all, they need to cut and paste it in that manner but the job was unfit anyway. I blame the denouement for that, if there had been a nice crash and burn at the end (much like Donnie Darko and The Dangerous Lives Of Altar Boys) the film wouldn't have been so choppy to begin with. All movies that are made to send a strong moral should have the character suffer a big loss in his or her life that they have to live with forever. Granted the ending does have some of that, it didn't really pay off in that manner and I felt a little cheated.Overall, I found Harvard Man to be an engrossing and disturbing film that interlocks philosophy, drug use, and crime into almost nicely wrapped package. If the ending had paid off, it would have been almost flawless.  Here ends my rant!

She has, unfortunately, been given no opportunities to show her considerable talent in film. While Cruel Intentions is a bad movie, Harvard Man is one of the worst - if not the worst - movie I have ever forced myself to sit through. The writing is practically non-existent. There are many scenes of back and forth dialogue with little purpose but to fill time. There are several simultaneous plots (gambling, drug addiction, sexual cheating, dealing with the mob), none of them interesting in their execution. There is no coherence - each plot thread seems forced in to fill time and is not interwoven with a big theme. One soon gets the feeling that the movie was started with little passion from the director, then finished in a hurry to meet a deadline. Harvard Man is transparently what it is a quickly-made attempt to capitalize on Gellar's fame. To watch it is to wait for its end, amazed that such a thing actually made it as a major motion picture. I CAN'T believe the average rating here is close to 5. Anyone who says this movie is anything but awful is either mentally deficient or has an agenda. The only reason to watch this movie is to gawk at its atrociousness.

Never thought FBI agents were such avid swingers or whatever those scenes are about.

Joey Lauren Adams has a GREAT voice-for playing a stripper or some such type, not a college professor-of philosophy of all things! Further, she is an item with male lead. I guess she is enchanted with his crooked behavior or his getting stoned out of his head with LSD. Maybe she thinks he looks like Kant. Then there is a gangster, henchmen, FBI agents, all running around for no particular purpose. There is cutting back and forth in time so there is no linear time line. This adds confusion to a film which is already terminally confusing. Sarah Michelle Geller is the one consistent character in the film. She plays it well because she has a part to play. She is a stereotype with no interesting lines, but her part is the closest this film comes to a real character. This was shot around Harvard in Cambridge Mass. I didn't see any scenes inside Harvard itself. Even Harvard could not have been stupid enough to cooperate with the making of this stinker.

He takes a story of a basketball player at Harvard, Allan (Adrian Grenier), and transforms his conflicts with his multiple love interests (mob-daughter girlfriend played by Sarah Michelle Gellar, philosophy professor Joey Lauren Adams), his big gamble that he has to take a dive at a game to get his parents money for their house, the FBI after this backfires, and, mostly, his adventure into fifteen thousand milligrams of pure LSD, into a delirious little epic. Yes, epic.Toback's style is all over the place from start to finish. His camera reaches up high and is usually moving, even when there is absolutely no real reason to. The excess in the camera movement is also complimented (or not) by an over-written script, which is something that doesn't happen usually unless a writer, like Toback, doesn't know when to stop with his characters. He compensates by having them talk fast (that or his editor takes out the little catch-my-breath beats in a conversation), and while not as annoying as the camera movements in most scenes in the first half of the film, it's noticeable. It's a filmmaker reaching far, maybe too far, into a realm of personal expression and putting the story into a modern setting - check the Bach mixed with rap and rock for more of that.And yet it's hard to totally begrudge what Toback does get right here. When we're meant to take a lot of this seriously in the first half (the deep philosophical talk in Chesney's class about Kierkegard and Lichtenstein or that mob 'family' of caricatures), it's interesting but it never really works dramatically. But when Toback suddenly shifts the tone in the second half, when Allan takes the three cubes of LSD, it suddenly becomes a full-on comedy of errors and surprises. To be sure, some of the visual jokes and whacked-out faces that Allan sees could be attributed to the same style as Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas, it still works. Especially funny is how Allan just seems to slip out of the FBI's hands (watch the one really strong scene of cinematography, sound, and acting all combined in the FBI interrogation room), and a masterpiece of a cameo appearance from Al Franken (like Toback also former Harvard alum).It also helps with the comedy in the second half of the film that the acting, more or less, is pretty strong. Sarah Michelle Gellar actually gives one of her most convincing, well-rounded performances as a B-word whose intentions are not very well hidden but puffed up with rich-girl sass and sex appeal. Grenier also goes for broke as a guy with a good sense of himself, until he bugs out from the acid and runs all over town. Adams might be a little more of the one-note performance, the stable voice but not as intriguing as Gellar and Grenier in their roles. They're all put in a movie that is mixed up and has a lot to say about sex, drugs, life, living, betting, sports, and lots more. I respect Harvard Man, and if those trip-out scenes come on TV I'll be sure to watch again. But recommend?

A self-described addictive personality who's gone tortuously from Harvard to Hollywood, he's been called the closest thing to an auteur that America has produced. Toback's latest film tosses a young, talented cast into a twister of jump-cuts, psychadelics, crime and punishment that leaves one either gasping for breath or begging for more.Adrian Grenier plays a philandering philosophy major at Harvard who, through one of his girlfriends, throws a basketball game for big money and winds up in a heap of trouble.  Grenier's character is more than eye-catching.  We have a sincere guy who's on the ultimate heroic journey the search for self.  His means are bumbling, as are most's, but what he gains along the way is the stuff of the true individual.The film was shot almost exclusively with a Steadicam, which lead Toback to screw with the linear storyline of the film for editorial as well as narrative purposes.  This was the first time I thought editing could be a fun part of the whole process, he remarked after the screening, and it shows.  The story is narrative in the traditional sense, but the incessant jumping past slow points to expedite the action, or forward and back in time as interrelated moments are told simultaneously, keep the pacing break-neck.This is a film even teeny-boppers will get, at least on the surface.  Its philosophy is as deep as Linklater's Waking Life, spliced with the action of Peckinpah's The Getaway.  It's full of sex, drugs, hip-hop and classical music (Grenier has both playing while he and Gellar get it on in the film's opening scene).  It shows a dangerous irreverence to authority figures (Grenier screws his prof and later jumps out of an FBI window).  But hell, that's what authority is there for, to set up the limits that the hero must overcome.  If you haven't figured that out yet, see this film and maybe you'll begin to understand.

Maybe this is one of those cases where a film is so unique that it takes a second viewing to truly appreciate its depth and complexity. This time, even though I knew what was going to happen, I found the dramatic tension mesmerizing. I think this is a testament not only to the really fine acting (okay, so I'm a big Buffy fan!), but also to the subtle nuances of Toback's script and his sure hand as a director. I now really admire the economy of the writing and the way Toback gets to the point really quickly in each scene. I thought the way he subtly interwove the philosophy professor's treatises on Wittgenstein's theories of language (I'm sort of a philosophy buff myself) with the main character's desire to break free of the bonds of our normal world. And I like the way their relationship isn't portrayed as merely a seedy affair--they truly seem to like each other, and having them walk arm-in-arm across the campus was a nice touch. (Then again, what undergrad wouldn't want to get to know Professor Joey Lauren Adams a bit better?) Oh, one other thing I don't know how I missed it the first time, but Ray Allan is a remarkably subtle actor. I think I was too startled by the scene where he draws the gun to realize the real confusion and anguish his character is going through. Far from being ridiculous or offensive, I now have to give a big shout out to Allan for pulling off that scene! So I guess the lesson I've learned is that being in a bad mood can affect one's opinion of a movie.

In Fingers, Harvey Keitel auditioned as a concert pianist at Carnegie Hall, moments after collecting a past due debt for his bookmaker father. In The Gambler James Caan is a Philosophy Professor at Columbia, who loses so much betting football, that he must steal from his mother and convince one of his students to shave points during a basketball game. Harvard Man takes facets of  these previous films, entwines them in sex and hallucinagenic drugs and the result is an exceptional film. The contrasts throughout the film are many and exist on a variety of levels, as is the film's musical score, which consists of works by Bach played concurrently with Hip Hop. The last third of the film is a combination of sex, drugs, rock n roll, gambling and gangsters, which even though somewhat flawed, puts a finishing touch on Toback's most challenging film.

Personally I knew very little about it before I bought it today and watched it, and I was pleasantly surprised. The trailer, like a lot of trailers, it seems, tells you very little about the movie and if anything is completely misleading. The film starts out introducing us to the 3 major players of this film, Allen(Grenier), a Harvard basketball player and philosophy major who is looking for the ultimate form of consciousness through drug experimentation, his sort-of girlfriend Cindy(gellar), the calculating and very smart but-maybe-in-just-a-little-over-her-head daughter of a mob boss, and his philosophy professor and lover Chesney(JLA). Allen's life changes when his parents home in Kansas, is hit by a tornado and, in what has to be the very definition of the phrase Deus ex machina, they do not have tornado insurance. In Kansas. For real. However weak this pitiful plot device is, and believe me I almost shut this movie off right then and there, it does get the real plot going, which turns out to be fantastic. Allen, seeking to ease his parents' financial woes, take the advice of his philosophy professor to ask his girlfriend's father for money. Initially he is turned down, but Cindy informs him that all he needs to do is shave a few points off of an upcoming game and the money is his. After staying up all night debating the issue with himself, Allen receives a morning visit from a chemistry major friend who brings with her the original formula for LSD stuffed into sugar cubes, the way they were done in the 60's experiments. These events shape the rest of the film, taking us through a wild and extremely vivid acid trip that sees Cindy and Allen both being pursued by 2 federal agents who are apparently a couple working undercover on Cindy's dad, and who, coincidentally, are sexually involved with Chesney. All of these relationships work in rather manipulative ways, except for seemingly the relationship between student and professor, which seems genuine. The ending, while it may anger some, leaves a bit up to interpretation, unless of course you do about 3 minutes of research on LSD and Thorazine. Each cast member plays their part very well, especially the 2 female leads, the directing is not without its flaws but overall is very unique and very well done. This movie might have made a few more dollars and gotten some better reviews had they spent more time utilizing focus groups and marketing executives, but thankfully for those who are lucky enough to see this film and intelligent enough to enjoy it, they did not.

I have to say, I was pretty disappointed. I mean, I'm supposed to feel sorry for this guy? He's shamelessly sleeping with two women at the same time, and getting tripped out on LSD. What do I care if he gets out of his mess? He's not a good guy, in spite of the fact that the movie half-heartedly attempts to make him seem so, since he is trying to get money together for his parents to replace their home, which got blown away by a tornado. Here's a quick summary This guy is going to Harvard, and plays basketball for them. He is sleeping with SMG's character, whose father is a big time mobster. He is also sleeping with Joey Lauren Adams' character, who happens to be one of his teachers. His parent's home gets blown away by a tornado. He wants to help them replace it, so he asks SMG to ask her father for the money. She says he can have the money if he promises to fix a basketball game that has been bet on, so even more money can be won. The FBI gets wind of this, and try to cause a lot of trouble for SMG and her father. They attempt to get this guy to turn them in. The FBI team (a boy and a girl who his other girlfriend happens to be having regular threesomes with) let his other girlfriend know what's going on, and she tries to get him out of it. While all this chaos is going on, this guy is totally tripped out on LSD, hearing voices, hallucinating, etc. Pretty ridiculous. So, basically, my main problem with this movie was that I didn't like any of these characters. None of them seemed like good people, like anyone that I would care much one way or the other what happened to them. No sympathy for anyone. So, I was actually sitting through the whole movie, hoping it would be over soon because I was tired of watching it. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. The only good point I thought Sarah Michelle Gellar did a good job with her part. She was very believable. I didn't think of her as Buffy once during this movie.

Supposedly cast by Mary Vernieu, the movie is really cast by Toback's weiner what else explains the surrealism of Joey Lauren Adams as a Harvard philosophy professor (at 28!) lecturing undergraduates on Wittgenstein's distrust in the expressivity of language? Or, for that matter, Rebecca Gayheart as a hard-as-nails (but, of course, secretly bisexual) FBI agent?In BLACK AND WHITE, Toback's zany stunt casting (Brooke Shields as Nick Broomfield! Brett Ratner as a sleazy hack filmmaker!) worked, because the director let 'em roll, baby, roll. Here, Toback seems to have patterned his dialogue scenes after HIS GIRL FRIDAY--and the editing gooses the rhythms even further, so every scene plays like a MAD TV parody of crystal-meth freaks having a 78-rpm conversation. Adrian Grenier plays the hero, Alan, a Harvard point guard, philosophy freak, and cocksman extraordinaire, who greets mob goons and Martin Heidegger alike with the same cool, adult, always-unexpectedly-detached repose. He shocks everyone in every situation with his infinitely wise underreaction to everything. Grenier suggests a moist pretty-boy naif in a Truffaut or Assayas movie; only late in the day, when he overdoses on LSD, does he seem to be acting at all. (That's not meant in a good way.) He divides his bed time between a mobster's daughter (Sarah Michelle Gellar, going for indie street cred just in case SCOOBY DOO didn't turn out) and the aforementioned  girl-philosopher-queen (played by Adams as a kind of baby-voiced, bulbous-nosed Diane Sawyer). When Alan has to shave points in a Harvard-Dartmouth game to help his folks in Kansas rebuild their house after a tornado (why this movie allusion?), he gets in trouble with the mob and the Feds--and, this being a Toback movie, it's only a four-way with Eric Stoltz and three hot tamales that can get Alan out of hot water.Like Toback's other dud, THE PICK-UP ARTIST, HARVARD MAN seems to have been thought-over to death. Toback massaged this material for many years; the LSD material and even the mob stuff dates the movie, marks it as Toback's bittersweet homage to his early-sixties youth. Set in the present no doubt for economic reasons, the picture makes no sense; but worse, Toback's heart isn't in it.  This miserable cast doesn't give him the charge of the astonishing mix of great actors, interesting actors and stunning nonactors that made up BLACK AND WHITE. As another Toback gem, the non-fiction THE BIG BANG, proves, he needs a party full of bright minds to get things sparking. Without cast, Toback's Dostoevskian torments quickly turn into congealed Cinemax sleaze--and that will be the elephant graveyard where this blooper will no doubt lie.

Director James Toback originally wanted Leonardo Dicaprio to play the leading role, because of Titanic - he became 'too expensive' which was actually a good thing. The director then cast Adrien Grenier in place - thank god! The film has a realistic theme and comes somewhere between 'Traffic' and 'American Beauty'. Sarah Michelle Gellar was Toback's first choice to play Cindy Bandollini and despite her heavy schedule and limited time she could spend on making the film because of 'Buffy' I think she did really well. It must be difficult to really set herself in and give a good performance when she has such little time. Her character was quite enjoyable - she was the most entertaining person in the film. Without SMG this films would have been a complete flop. The film is an eye opener for teenagers -they are set in a place that makes them feel like they are on a drug trip - the fact that taking LSD would never bring you down again is a frightening thought for teenagers playing with fire. The film's scenes are presented in a clever way - the effect of speeding up conversation is effective. It is a complicated film that will leave most people in the dark.

But I do and it was great fun seeing all the familiar campus sites. It was refreshing after Legally Blonde and How High which were actually filmed at USC and UCLA. Al Franken's (harvard class of 72) cameo (as well as his real-life daughter's) are terrific. The movie's not perfect, but it is funny, sexy, and the acid-tripping sequences are unlike anything seen before (well, it's like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, but a little more advanced) And Sarah Michelle Gellar is at her kinkiest.

The story is flat and full of narrative cliches. Also there is a lot of male wishful thinking in here (eg. the student-heros liaison both with his young, blonde philosophy-professor and at the same time with some rich chick owning a sports car). The drug fantasies later on are a poor-mans REQUIEM FOR A DREAM. Everything is striving to be hip. But the jump cuts just look cheap and fidgety, making the viewer nervous instead of adding tempo. Avoid!

From the very beginning I was drawn in, as much as one can be when someone is fornicating with Sarah Michelle Gellar while playing music from multiple boom boxes and smoking a blunt. I found the character development intriguing & the casting was superb. I like the choice of protagonist, a lesser-known actor surrounded by more recognizable peers, similar to Donnie Darko. The cinematography was interesting, and the portrayal of the effects of LSD were as accurate as I've ever seen on film, sans Fear & Loathing. The subject matter encompasses vices of many flavors. Never before have I seen promiscuity, gambling, deceit, drug use, and gun play so eloquently infused with the likes of philosophical banter. This movie greatly appealed to my sense of intellect as I often found myself caught in sheer amazement that a film like this had been produced and slipped under my radar for so long. It deals with real life scenarios and subject matter often too taboo to be portrayed ever so causally, a refreshing look at a facet rarely seen. It's abstract intellectualism combined with sex and drug use surely won't appeal to conservative film watchers. This is definitely a film for a niche audience and I applaud James Toback for this peek into real life.

Thank goodness I didn't rent this (saw it on TV). The bloatedly egotistical writer/director, who's way too in love with his Harvard degree, wasted a decent idea by creating one-dimensional characters and then casting with second-rate actors -- none of whom is a complex-enough/bright-enough person or skilled-enough actor to convince viewers that they're Harvard students or instructors -- who turned in one-dimensional performances. I can only imagine that he was jumping on the youth bandwagon and thus cast some of the names of the moment, but he would have done better had he gone with unknowns who are actually gifted. Utter waste of time; do not watch this. "},{"Title":"Brilliant, if not misunderstood","Date":"16 January 2006","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Drama","Review":" This is one of my favorite films of all time. It has everything--an amazing cast, great screenplay, good camera work, comedy, action, suspense, drugs, and most importantly to me, intellectual value. Despite the plot having to do with LSD, FBI, and the Mafia, and despite Ray Allen being in the movie (though I did actually like his performance), this movie is basically about philosophy. If you have a background in philosophy, or if you just generally like thinking about existence, check it out. You won't be disappointed.It should be noted, though, that if you're looking for a typical drama, or teen comedy, or anything like that, you'll probably want to steer clear from this one. In order to enjoy it fully, you've gotta be ready for an adventure of the soul.

Did the casting of SMG make them think it would be a brainless teen comedy? I can see why you'd be disappointed if you don't like movies that require you to think. James Toback is brilliant, and so is this movie.Definitely get it on DVD so you can listen to the director's commentary.This movie is about philosophy and self discovery, but it isn't preachy or trying too hard to be deep. It is full of interesting, multi-dimensional characters.The visual techniques of the film are uniquely appropriate to the subject matter and emotional feel of the film.  "}]
