It's very well done and quite absorbing. Sure it makes me think of so-called student-films (my brother is in film school), but that's not to say it's not a damn good one. There's something to be said for beautiful photography (the black and white images go so well with the feelings of emptiness and coldness) and the search for a meaning in life. These people are desperately in need of meaning and affection, none of which they seem to be able to find - or give. This is a movie about that desperate search.And it's well worth seeing - for those with a bit of patience and artistic sensibility. It's a movie about emptiness for sure, but is by no means 'boring'.

What he presents here is a unique little treatise on youth, on the subtle and disconnected qualities that go in life when you don't have much to do. In a way it's an existentialist film without many very serious questions to deal with story or even character-wise (except until maybe the last fifteen minutes in the Paradise segment). Like a French New-Wave film, to which Jarmusch was heavily influenced by (i.e. the gorgeous, grainy black and white photography by Tom DiCillo), he leaves more for the audience to ponder, as they go along on their journey.One of the things that Stranger Than Paradise has going for it is a sort of realism that, like and not-like a Wes Anderson film for example, is off-beat. Only here it is more of an urban sort of landscape and interiors that Jarmusch gives us with, along with its three principles. John Lurie as Willie is very good at having attitude when he needs it, but in reality is rather low-key in his 'hip-ness'. His cousin from Hungary pays him a visit (Eszter Balint as Eva, maybe too low-key at times, though appropriately observant of foreign territory). There is also his faithful companion Eddie, played in a great supporting tone and style by Richard Edson. The first segment of the film deals with her in New York. The second one has Eddie and Willie go to Cleveland to pay Eva a visit. Then in the third segment they go down to Florida to have some fun, only to have anything but.In other words, those looking for a film where a lot of things 'happen' may be disappointed, or just bored. I've seen the film twice now, and on the first viewing I was a little detached from what was going on on screen, which is just little things going on with the characters, like one would see in everyday life. But on the second viewing I somehow connected more with these characters, the youth that seem to drift needlessly along. The editing of the film is also the most simplistic, though highly effective, in adding to the disconnected quality of Jarmusch's direction- no cuts during dialog, just fading to black, fading up, fading to black, fading up (Jarmusch would continue this with Down by Law and Dead Man, though not as frequent or strategic).In fact, the whole film is rather deliberate in its style, but as the song that plays several times in the film I Put a Spell On You from Screamin' Jay Hawkins plays, it does work to bring a viewer in...or not. Like many in the art-film world, almost all of Jarmusch's films are either liked or not, and I think that's appropriate for his stories, which often deal with low-key characters dealing with unusual but either realistic or metaphorical situations. One thing I can say for certain, much like the French new-wave films inspired by it, it's imitated, but not equaled in its form.

Essentially a character study, the story is a glimpse into the lives of three people  Willie (John Lurie); his cousin, Eva (Eszter Balint), recently arrived in New York from Hungary; and Willie's friend, Eddie (Richard Edson).  After a couple of weeks in the Big Apple with Willie, Eva moves to Cleveland to live with their Aunt; a year later, Willie and Eddie are off to visit her.  One thing leads to another, and the trio wind up in Florida (the designated paradise of the title).  Watching this film is like spending time with some people you know; the characters are real people, so much so that watching them becomes almost voyeuristic, the camera somehow intrusive, exposing as it does the private lives of these individuals.  It succinctly captures their lack of ambition, the ambiguity with which they approach life, and the fact that they seemingly have no prospects for the future beyond whatever a lucky day at the track affords them.  The action, such as it is, is no more than what you would find in the average day of someone's life.  The dialogue is what drives the film, though frankly, nothing they have to say is very interesting.  And yet, this is an absolutely engrossing film; sometimes amusing, at times hilarious, but  mesmerizing throughout.   	The performances are entirely credible, and again, you never have the sense that these are actors, but rather real people who happen to have had some moments from their lives filmed and presented to the audience for perusal.  Jarmusch has an innate sense of capturing the essence of the everyday and transforming the most simplistic and mundane events into refreshingly documented, worthwhile viewing.  It's an inspired piece of film making, helped to some extent by the stark black&white photography that adds to the realism of the overall proceedings.  The use of brief blackouts during transitions works effectively, as well as providing the film with a unique signature.  Original music is by Lurie, but the highlight is the use of the song `I Put A Spell On You,' by Screamin' Jay Hawkins, used recurringly throughout the movie, and which exemplifies that special touch Jarmusch brings to his projects.  And there's a superb bit of irony at the end that really makes this gem sparkle.  			The supporting cast includes Cecillia Stark (Aunt Lotte), Danny Rosen (Billy), Tom DiCillo (Airline Agent), Richard Boes (Factory Worker) and Rockets Redglare, Harvey Perr and Brian J. Burchill (as the Poker players).  `Stranger Than Paradise' may not be to everyone's liking, but to those seeking an alternative to the typical Hollywood big-budget fare available, it just may fit the bill and provide a satisfying, entertaining experience.  I rate this one 8/10.

I'd always recalled the film with fondness, although I could never remember why I liked it. Several years after seeing the movie I came across the John Lurie soundtrack and bought it without stopping to listen, and been slightly taken aback by it. The haunting pieces were more emotionally esoteric than I expected, and it took some time for the album to grow on me.Seeing the movie again, I understand why. The only piece of popular music in the film is Screamin' Jay Hawkin's I Put a Spell on You and, although I had forgotten that it was there, I guess that I had expected the soundtrack to be more like those of mainstream movies and have songs and such-like. I think that Lurie's music is perfect in situ and, as I've said, the soundtrack has also grown on me as standalone pieces.The movie itself is a masterpiece. The black and white images present a starkness and a clarity that heightens the alienation of self in a land that was supposed to be the new hope for immigrants from a decaying old world. Instead we see Eva walking through a deserted ghost world of New York where the graffiti says Yankee go home. America is only a dream, a collective vision of a better world; paradise somewhere on earth.As Willie and Eddie journey west after winning some money, we see that the supposedly beautiful city of Cleveland is cold and desolate with a frozen lake. The further trip to Florida ends in the middle of nowhere next to a bleak and windswept ocean. Paradise is still somewhere out of reach. I think that's why the movie appeals to me. It shows that the America of popular mythology - the home of the brave, land of the free, protector of the downtrodden, guardian of democracy in the free world - is merely a construct. Too many people these days believe in the child's fantasy of America being some paradise that Iraq and Afghanistan should emulate. Jarmusch reminds us that it is people who give meaning to a symbol, not the other way around. He allows for the ability of people to make their own meanings and evolve beyond the stagnation of popular culture.At a time I originally saw this movie I had recently left home and got my first job, moving from the country to the city, and maybe to some extent I identified with Eva - moving from Budapest to America. It was also my first taste of grownup film, if I recall correctly, and confirmed me with a lifelong fascination with the cinema. I have a lot to thank Jim Jarmusch for.

Every scene is a single take, some static, some with very stylized camera movement (static shot up the street to an approaching car; pick up car and track it as it passes, static again as it drives off). Occasionally an actor wanders off screen to the right, despite the camera trying to keep up; just this slight effect, surrounded as it is by so much silence and stillness, is enough to produce a slight frisson of tension. Blackouts separate the scenes, but either ambient sound or music cues continue as transitions during the cuts.The main characters' costumes underline their alienation from the world around them. Judging from the props & surroundings, film seems to be set in contemporary (early-1980s) time. Willie and Eddie dress and act like late-Fifties/early-Sixties racetrack touts, and they seem most at ease in the retro living room of Aunt Lotte, who presumably left Hungary during that period. Eva's costumes likewise proclaim 'outsider,' though the dreary black she wears can signify either a refugee from East Europe or a jaded bohemian poseur.First viewing a number of years back, I thought the film was offhanded and casual, with not much going on. A second viewing changed my mind - the absolute minimalism of the plot and dialogue leave plenty of space to explore Jarmusch's technique, composition, etc. It made me laugh out loud a couple of times, too.

His recent Coffee and Cigarettes might have alluded to his roots as an indie filmmaker, but its stories are monochromatic and offer little emotional variety save for the Albert Molina vignette. His best film might be this one, a miniature masterpiece that is underrated when compared to his other stuff. The basic premise of the film revolves around a New York immigrant from Eastern Europe, his goofy buddy, and his female cousin who comes to visit him and America as they jump from state to state.There isn't much of a plot for sure, but Jarmusch more than compensates for this fact by creating three distinct characters that manage to be sweet without resorting to cheap sentiment. These guys might be rude and frivolous at times, but they never lose their sense of embarrassed compassion, nor as a direct result their humanity as complete characters as well. There's a morose wit to all of these proceedings. All three actors truly seem to have a playful camaraderie, working the motions of a natural friendship with Jarmusch's direction that shows them at their happiest only to be disappointed again and again, like a kid getting clothes instead of video games at Christmas once more. This honest and easygoing subtext doesn't include undemanding Hollywood moments of syrupy tenderness or mawkish emotion. For once, the clichéd adage of characters writing themselves is probably true here, as the film has an almost improvised quality to it. Jarmusch gets the careful balance between static ugliness and a subtext of natural warmth just right.While the great heart of this film lies in its characterization, it's catapulted into greatness because of Jarmusch's quiet touch. In nearly every one of his films the director is obsessed with the awkward silences that make up nearly every relationship. He's much more revealing with the silences here, fleshing out character development in a car ride or while staring out at the blankness of snowy Cleveland. This brings me to my final point that Jarmusch again does with intelligence. When the characters move from city to city, they have a passionate belief that what they will find is something unbelievable. But the New York we see is a bunch of back alleys and graffiti. Cleveland is a blank white expanse, strangely vapid as opposed to pictorial. And Florida has to be the ugliest Florida ever depicted on screen, consisting mainly of a Welcome to Florida sign and a decrepit motel. While the main message is that life is often full of disappointments, that life is rarely full of transcendent moments, people can still connect with each other regardless of their surrounding environments. It's Jarmusch's best statement yet, and it's for these reasons this one must be seen even before even his fine Mystery Train. The film, essentially a three-character comedy, is also thankfully kept brief, becoming genuinely meaningful and moving as a result.

The velvety rich blacks, grays, and whites, plus the composed still scenes, cause me to think Jarmusch was trained as a static, 2-D artist first. Just a guess. This film is NOT about acting, which is limited at best, but doesn't really need much. We observe an alienated set of scenarios which are only enhanced by the stiff, awkward exchanges and pauses of the characters, and the lack of movement in the camera work. Ambient sound adds to the gritty reality of emptiness. Funny or not, this is a low-key, lost-souls story of detachment and aimlessness.

Willie is ashamed of his Hungarian heritage and is resentful of Eva's stay which was intended to be much shorter. Eva ignores his rude behavior and the two eventually begin to bond. A year later Willie and his goofy friend Eddie borrow a car to visit Eva in Cleveland in spite of their lack of interest in the area. From there the trio sets off on vacation to a Florida paradise that never quite materializes.Although transients and others who are uncomfortable with their environments appear frequently in the films of Jim Jarmusch to this day, the theme of impermanence is particularly evident in his early work. His student film Permanent Vacation is about a man who slowly says goodbye to his home city before fulfilling the promise of the title, Mystery Train is a film set in Memphis with hardly any characters who have spent much time there, and Night on Earth takes place almost entirely in moving motor vehicles.Thus it's no surprise that none of the three main characters in Stranger Than Paradise shows any intention to acquire a steady job (or any job at all in the case of the male characters) or any reluctance to take an extended leave of absence from his or her normal life. These characters have a price to pay for their freedom, however although they aren't tied down in any one place everywhere they go seems to be the same as the last place they were in. The areas they inhabit in New York, Ohio, and Florida are progressively less urban but they all look equally drab and uninviting; even the beach they visit looks utterly cheerless. These are characters whose hang-ups have nothing to do with their surroundings; they're going to find the same experiences no matter where they go because they have walled themselves into a perfectly insular world where they're free to behave the same way all the time and enjoy the same limited pleasures and discomforts. This is why Willie is just as unwilling to take Eva out with his friend in Florida as he is in New York. This isn't lost on the characters, however, as Willie responds to Eddie's complaint that even in a new place everything looks the same with three words No kidding, Eddie. While Eddie is barely bright enough to recognize their situation, Willie is too apathetic and arrogant to attempt to change it. The only character who ever seems to make a conscious effort to break free from the Sartrean purgatory they have slipped into is Eva, whose motivations tend to be hidden behind her inability to communicate with her self absorbed companions. She's as ineffectual as she is enigmatic, however, as ultimately even her most impulsive actions fail to bring about any meaningful change.Writer/director Jim Jarmusch does an excellent job of capturing the existential quandary of his characters through careful choice of locations and aesthetics. His camera tends to be still and his shots tend to be long; in fact the characters almost seemed to be trapped within the camera frame in many shots. Perhaps his most notable accomplishment in Stranger Than Paradise is his ability to capture locations that give a sense of disparate geography but still maintain a coldly similar atmosphere consistently. With only his second feature film Jarmusch was already beginning to find his own cinematic voice.

He has this approach that is far from being Hollywood and mainstream. This is the most radical in that respect, of the four. There are no cuts; every scene is one shot, and while the camera may move a little to follow the people, it will never go to a different take. The editing and cinematography are yet again subtle and do not draw attention to themselves. There is hardly any plot(and there isn't meant to be). The dialog is minimalist. It's about the credible and consistent characters and the environment, and it also deals with immigration and culture. Willie is a hustler in NY, trying to run away from his background; it gets on his nerves when his cousin(who comes to live with him, much to his dismay) and his aunt speak Hungarian. The acting is mixed. This has next to no music, and it isn't a manipulative production. It isn't for everyone; many will find it boring, and if what I've described thus far sounds like it would be dull, then you may not be in the intended audience.

I remember at the time telling people what an amazing film it was, deliberately non-commercial and, while the plot is not really about much, it has a rhythm and clarity that was so unlike films at the time. Shot in black and white, the film consists of a number of snapshot scenes, there is a slight pause between scenes in which the screen goes black, a very effective method of telling this deceptively simple story. Basically, its the story of Eva (Eszter Balint), who has to stop over on her way to Cleveland to live with her Aunt Lotte, emigrating from Hungary. She has to stay at her cousin Willie's apartment in New York for ten days. Willie is played with remarkable restraint by John Lurie, who at the time was the epitome of cool since he fronted the jazz band The Loungs Lizards. Willie and his friend Eddie (Richard Edson, also very good) decide to drive to Cleveland a year after Eva visited to see Eva and Aunt Lotte. What follows is a few bizarre coincidences, after Eva, Willie and Eddie decide to drive to Florida. That the story is told so soberly and with remarkable continuity made people at the time and since hail writer/director Jarmusch as an important voice in cinema, a distinction he still holds. A few observations about the film The film to me seems like it could be influenced by Japanese master Ozu. The simple layout of the film, the camera angles etc are somewhat of an homage to the great filmmaker. Also, the soundtrack, which was composed by Lurie, is extremely effective in sustaining the mood of the film. This film is not for everyone, it is a stark, simple but utterly compelling independent minded film. This film is not for casual film fans. Actually, I think this film should be part of the curriculum of any film class. If you can come close to equaling Jarmusch's sense of both the absurd and reality, you could turn out to be as much of an auteur as he is considered.

Indeed, both males are swarthy with hook noses and fedoras. They have such little interest in or knowledge of anything that their eventual vacation is no different from home.The quirky way to three-act story format is a succession of single-shot scenes punctuated by black leader, and the clear-cut partition of the story into three straightforward, facetiously named episodes. Yet there are other ceremonial characteristics of substance Tom DiCillo's black-and-white camera work, which provides Jarmusch's acute impression for the American panorama; and the arresting appliance of music, which favorably apposes Screamin' Jay Hawkins's I Put a Spell on You with the folksy tinges of John Lurie's score for string quartet. This is definitely a road movie, but one with a distinction Different from most instances of the then still immensely fashionable genre, Stranger Than Paradise appeared simultaneously comprehensively American and strangely European.The oddly enlightening aggregate of involvement and reserve may be found in the film's lovingly absurd view of Willie's chic affectations, its quaint posture toward some of the inanities of American culture and in the way it harmonizes a decidedly American genre and decidedly American plot---if a narrative as gravely sparse and as concentrated on dead moments may be dubbed a plot---with all form of un-Hollywood expression. The look, rhythm, cast and mainly dismal feel bring to mind not The Blues Brothers, or even the rather subdued Last Detail, but the beginnings of the degree of minimalism to which Jarmusch would take his later work.However he also loves various attributes of popular culture. See how Willie and Eva watch Forbidden Planet on TV or go with Eddie and Eva's discouraged fancier to see a bone-crunching Hong Kong martial-arts flick at a Cleveland grindhouse, and lets them neighbor more virtuous aspects of his films, in such a way that there is no discrepancy between high and low. And it's for that scarce but wholly judicious mindset that Jarmusch is to be particularly noted. It's doable to distinguish his connection with a gamut of later American indie directors, specifically in his desert drollery, his passionately entertained captivation with slackers of sundry kinds, his concern with sequential framework, his affinity for severely subdued stories, and his clever, antiquated references to popular culture. All these, at a time scarce in American cinema, are now pretty ubiquitous. But the rhyme, the unabashed regard for cinema as a quality, production, expression, a realm, according to aesthetic principles, of what is beautiful, appealing, or of more than ordinary significance, even the mundanities of life and the most everyday scenery possible, that can confront crucial, important matters is far more difficult to come across.Considering, in the end, no matter how amusing, stylized, minute or insignificant his films may strike one at first, they are always about something. For all his cinephilia, they're inspired not, like Tarantino and Rodriguez, by other movies, but by life by real people, encountering real feelings. And while this black-and-white deadpan pop culture satire may be a comedy, an dissection of cinematic storytelling, and a thoroughly cynical yarn, it's also a film about America and the people who live there. It's about those people's connections to each other, and their connections to the rooms they populate, the city streets, the suburbs, diners and highways. And it's made by someone who knows there may be reality in abstraction, who finds a visceral alliteration separating a snow-coated Lake Erie and a barren Florida beach, and who fashions an implausibly true character like Aunt Lotte, always jabbering to her tender company in Hungarian, whether they're listening or not.

It is where the boat moored after Permanent Vacation, so it is out of the same universe, the same general headspace, but in a different country, a new world.I'll recount a part of the story, because I liked it.Willie lives in Purgatory, somewhere in New York. He comes from Hungary, but suppresses his European heritage under a facade of hip film-noir Americanism. His cousin, Eva (the femme fatale if we see it as noir), who has just arrived in America from Budapest, blows into his life like bad news from an Aunt Lotte in Cleveland. Willie is forced to 'babysit' Eva while his aunt stays in hospital for 10 days. He is aggrieved by this disruption to his life, even though TV dinners, games of solitaire, and long sleeps are about the only things to disrupt.Willie's small, dour apartment holes them up for the duration like the prison in Down By Law. Their time together is uneventful in the large, but very frank in revealing the slow time ordinariness and emotional seclusion of Willie's life. He bans Eva from speaking in Hungarian even though he knows the language, he forbids her from answering his phone, prohibits her from going anywhere with him, presumably because it would contradict the barricade of his cool, noirish, self-image, and impatiently attempts to educate her in Americanisms he barely understands himself. Their only interruption from themselves or each other is a visit from Willie's gambling buddy, Eddie, whose warm and polite attempts to include Eva in their adventures outside are upset by his deference to Willie's personality. When it comes time for Eva to leave for Cleveland, Willie has acted upon a bud of affection but can only express it in jaded terms. He insists Eva wear a dress he bought for her, even though she doesn't like it, because she should dress like an American when she is in America.This is where the first part ends, or nearly. On the street, after Eva and Willie have exchanged goodbyes, Eddie finds Eva abandoning the dress that Willie bought as a gift. Eddie does not mention this to Willie, presumably because he does not want to hurt his feelings. It is all unspoken. Willie and Eddie sit and drink beer, both reflect on Eva's visit without speaking.Originally, the film ends here. It was shot using leftover film from Wim Wenders' The State of Things. A year or two later, the group decided to extend the film or finish it. I won't go into the next 2/3. Suffice to say, after hustling some money in a poker game a year later, Willie and Eddie decide to visit Eva in Cleveland. Perhaps Willie realised he was missing something and Eddie did hide a profound sense of loneliness.Stranger Than Paradise is shot in a way that subverts mainstream notions of entertainment and engagement. It is an action film, but its definition of action is subtle and internal, left to the sensitivities of the watcher to engage with. The weather is a strong and active force, negotiating the lives of the characters like another character. This, I guess, has something to do with Ozu, mentioned by Eddie in his reference to Tokyo Story as the horse to back while he reads Willie the odds.Jarmusch has been strongly influenced by and is educated in World cinema, establishing him as a kind of outsider at home, just like the characters. The film with its surface deadpan, hangs back from the perspectives of its characters in a kind of suspended relativism, which is throughout all of Jarmusch's work. The emotional depth is neither affirmed or denied. There is no absolute position.John Lurie (he played Willie and composed the music) composed sparse and sensitive strings to comment on his character, which serves to further the gap between the film's stance and its subject. This general stance does not endorse Willie's peevish superficiality nor does it extrapolate it into misfortune. It suggests a more natural, but didactic approach. A film noir protagonist's end always reflects on their preceding actions.Watch it if you haven't, watch it again if you have, or don't watch it. But it would surely fit any worthwhile definition of a 'good' film.

Basically Willie (John Lurie) is a self confessed hipster and slacker living in New York City, and his Hungarian cousin Eva (Eszter Balint) has arrived unexpectedly for a surprise visit lasting for ten days, while Aunt Lotte (Cecillia Stark) is in hospital. For a while he makes it clear he is not happy with her being around, but over time he enjoys her company, one instance where he really likes her is after she steals groceries and makes a TV dinner for him. The ten days pass and Eva is ready to leave, but is obvious Willie is upset after she has gone, Eddie (Richard Edson) made sure to help her out before she left, but Willie really wants her back. It is after winning a large amount of money cheating in a game of poker that the two friends start a journey to Cleveland, but even when they do find her, and spend some time with her friend Billy (Danny Rosen) they find they are just as bored as when they were in New York. Willie and Eddie decide rather than go back home to travel to Florida, and obviously they take Eva with them, but after settling a bit they lose all the money they have betting on dog races, and they try to win it back in horse races. After a trip to the beach Eva is mistaken for a drug dealer and gets a large amount of money, which she leaves some of for Willie, along with a note that she is going to the airport, and she sees the only European place to go is Budapest, her original home country. She decides to wait until the next day, and Willie and Eddie return having won all the money back on the horse races, but they find Eva has gone, and after seeing the note Willie rushes to get on the plane she should be travelling. The final shot though sees Willie getting on the plane to Budapest and it taking off, Eddie watches it take off and leave, but Eva has in fact gone back to the hotel they were staying, to an empty room. I can't really say anything much about the stars as I know none of them, only that they do a good job to not express many expressions and emotions at all, the same can be said for director Jarmusch, who creates a rather quiet film with not much going on, it is honestly a little dull, but that actually adds to the odd atmosphere and overall unpredictable feel of this strangely fascinating road movie drama.

Jim Jarmusch's ode to life in general and boredom in particular is both subtly hilarious and superbly stylish.Most films that deal with people being bored tend to become a bit boring themselves, but Stranger Than Paradise had me sitting with a smile on my face for the entire duration. Its biggest accomplishment is that it seems so true to life &#x96; the characters mostly just sit around talking, and the dialogue is remarkably realistic and seemingly improvised. And just like in real life, sometimes they haven't even got anything to talk about, like when Eddie (a wonderfully relaxed Richard Edson) goes to Willie's (John Lurie) apartment, after which they sit quietly staring down into the floor. Even when the two of them go on vacation to Cleveland, they spend most of the time in a house watching television, and Eddie remarks that all places look the same. That being said, the film does have a plot of sorts, even if it is a rather loose one, about Eddie, Willie and Willie's cousin Eva (Eszter Balint) going on a road trip together. Along the way, there are some more directly comedic scenes, such as when Eddie and Willie follow Eva and her date to the movies, or when Willie's aunt beats them all at a card game.The sparse narrative structure is perfectly matched by Jarmusch's simple direction. It makes great use of a static camera, and the black and white visuals are slightly grainy and in a sense quite unremarkable but at the same time strikingly beautiful. The imprecise editing, where most scenes are followed by a second or two of darkness that lets them sink in, along with the recurring use of I Put a Spell on You by Screamin' Jay Hawkins, also adds to the independent, bohemian vibe of the film.Apart from a few subtle cultural references, such as the fact that a race horse is named Tokyo Story, there doesn't seem to be much more to Stranger Than Paradise than what meets the eye. Luckily, there is often not a whole lot more to life either, making this the perfect film to watch whenever you have nothing better to do.

Willie is in the center of it, and he owns a small apartment in one of New York's lower-class neighborhoods. He is actually from Hungary, but he completely despises his heritage, and hates when his relatives speak to him in his native tongue. His cousin, Eva Mona, comes in from Hungary and he's forced to let her stay in his apartment. They both share a similar disdain for Eastern European culture, but Willie seems to be trying to delude himself that he enjoys his new American life. He tries to be complacent with eating TV dinners, playing card games, and watching TV for hours on end. Eva finds this completely boring and can't wait to go to Cleveland to stay with her Aunt Lotte. Although Willie and her begin on shaky grounds, by the time she leaves, a kind of bond grows between them.Willie has a good friend, Eddie, and they're both unemployed, getting their money through horse races and fixed poker games. They sense the boredom, the monotony setting in, and they're trying to avoid it. In fact, at one of their fixed poker games, they play with a few men who are in a similar situation victims of repeated defeat and disappointment. One of them is at the breaking point and displays aggression while the others are cowardly, weak, resigned. They meet another man, a factory worker, and it's obvious that he doesn't enjoy being a working stiff. In an effort to try to avoid turning into these men, Willie and Eddie decide to take a trip to Cleveland and visit Eva.Cleveland isn't exactly as exciting as they had hoped, and Eddie, bored out of his mind, remarks that Everything's the same. Eva is working at a hot dog stand and is involved with a man she's only half-interested in. n a matter of days, Eddie and Willie are reduced to sitting around playing card games again. The three decide to escape the monotony by going down to Florida and taking advantage of the wonderful weather. However, the weather is the only thing changes; the men go to the track to try and augment their funds while Eva spends most of her time inside. Once again, this paradise yields no heightened degree of happiness.The problem the three characters face is that they too often look for external factors to make them happy. Moving to somewhere nicer or making more money cannot change the numbing repetition; to do that, they must look on themselves and appreciate their company more. Unfortunately, by the end, the two men have become more like the people they were trying to avoid becoming Willie is more aggressive, Eddie is more resigned.The film really isn't as depressing as this review may make it seem. It has some very funny moments and is generally entertaining. Even the boredom is fun to watch, and this is achieved because of the very realistic dialogue. I found myself often relating to conversations they hold, being all too familiar with the awkward pauses. The characterization is impressive as well; Willie, Eddie, and Eva are all believable and we can understand their problems. If anyone has ever been bored to tears, they'll know exactly what the three are feeling.

It's the kind of movie that haunts you with unresolved questions after it's finished and leaves you in a state of agitation and unease. This film was not intended to pose big, existentialist questions on the meaning of life, more specifically on the meaning of the characters' life, which is absent, by the way. No, their petty, stifling existence is boiling at small fire, and the futility of their lives does not end up in a grand shout for innovation and purpose, as it happens in Nikita Mikhalkov's films, for example in An Unfinished Piece for a Player Piano and Five evenings, which I personally find pretty resembling to Stranger than paradise, mainly the latter, in terms of black and white shooting and silent, pausing atmosphere. However, unlike with Nikita Mikhalkov's characters, the relationships between the characters in Stranger than paradise and their existential uselessness lack the tension and final outburst that might ultimately bring them to a sense and absolution. The smallness of their lives is plainly felt like an itch, discomfort, being perhaps intentionally reduced to the plain state of boredom and consciously avoiding the magnitude of anguish. Being set on this rather minimalist, superficial scale, their journey is not a quest for some revelation, self-awareness and connection, but a mere attempt to shake up their sleepiness and have fun, which results in a failure and an excessive, ridiculous airplane situation twist. But, since the characters regard their own stories in such low key, this is lamentable and perfectly bearable at once. Their search for a place filled with life, sun and colors, which is Florida, ultimately takes them to a secluded, empty beach, a metaphor for their lives. They are put together, which seems almost fated, perhaps in order to make the best of their interaction and evolve through it, so they might try to bond with each other on a deeper level; the problem is they lack emotional depth or cannot access more profound layers of being because they are too alienated from a fuller self-perspective and in comic self-denial of the sad nature of their condition. The mood of the film is perfect, slow paced and somewhat sensual with I put a spell on you playing in the background, the dialogs are abundant in pauses, interruptions and discontinuity, just as the three characters' stand in life is, and their absurd conversations and involuntary humor (Hey, is Cleveland a little like, uh, Budapest?) gives more philosophical weight to the nonsense of their little adventure together to the outside viewer than to the characters themselves, who are too self-involved and stuck in their lives to acknowledge this mess they are in fully. A little masterpiece and a conceptual anticipation of the show about nothing brilliantly staged by Jerry Seinfeld.

Jarmusch's second feature and his first real introduction to the world is one of the best examples of that in terms of both aesthetics and entertainment value. The movie itself is a series of single takes divided by black leader, and never deviates from that form even in places where continuity editing could have been implemented. Indeed, every single shot is a vignette complete with its own beginning, middle, and end, and profoundly understated in simple ways. The seemingly flat black and white cinematography meshes with the wide-angle depth and creates a dynamic frame even though it's typically crowded with objects and characters (even though there are few set-pieces or characters). It looks like point-and-shoot but is so much more crafty than that.Jarmusch quite clearly wears his inspiration from Ozu on his sleeve and even references Tokyo Story in the dialog. But that said, Stranger than Paradise for me also mixed an acknowledgement of underground cinema such as Andy Warhol's Vinyl for simplicity's sake. In the same way that Vinyl is A Clockwork Orange in two crowded, dimensionless long takes, Stranger than Paradise is its own collection of self-evident virtuosity without the need for glamorous standards, making stars simply because it throws them up on screen, not because they are technically attractive people. In fact, the two main characters Eddie and Willie are kinda goofy looking, and all three main characters could be considered unattractive in their passivity and malaise. On the other hand, this movie, as noted often, is quite hip and certainly holds some Indie credentials (not that this is a bad thing, as it is definitely sincere).But it's just so smart in its approach. With limited celluloid and limited space, Jarmusch created an amazingly dynamic world. Without continuity editing, he created a very rhythmic and involved series of shots. Without relying on too much movement or action, he created characters of great depth and familiarity. And with low-grade black and white cinematography, he created a world to fit it all into.There are required viewing movies for classics and required viewing for film history. There are thousands upon thousands of movies that film buffs and film makers should watch or at least keep in mind about getting around to seeing. Stranger than Paradise is one of those I'd eagerly recommend to anyone who likes the thought of making movies but gets overwhelmed by the prospect of getting involved in what seems like such a complicated process. It just goes to prove that something amazing can be made out of something simple with a little forethought and a lot of care.--PolarisDiB "},{"Title":"Profound and clever debut by Jarmusch","Date":"26 March 2006","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" This film is slow, without an apparent point, and without any obvious substance.

Sounds uninteresting, drab and utterly boring, right? Wrong! Jarmusch is one of the most creative and inventive directors of his generation, this film is just a confirmation of his talent, his mysterious way, and convention defying cheek.The purpose of this film stems from its quiet, slow and melodic pace. It does not condescend, its far too tacit for that. The very meaning it follows is how the mundane is sometimes meaningful, that life is not made interesting my artificial barriers of wealth, culture and heritage but by attitude and personality. Several sequences are long, without any apparent message - and they are, if you don't look at the film as a whole and not as a set-piece extravaganza.Jarmusch's dry humour is omnipresent as always. The action scant, and without real artistic intention. The script very minimal and characters seemingly worthless.

It could almost pass for Kerouac on film the loneliness of America and the quiet desperation that is so brutally obvious and ever-present in its silence.  And there are very few filmmakers who would have the daring or the insight to include long moments of silence such as Stranger has.  Leave it to the existentialists to break a film-school taboo.  This is obviously not a film to show your college drinking buddies.  That's a good thing, though.  It's a film that meditates, for lack of a better term.  And it demands that the viewers meditate, contemplate the grey, endless skies and the endless layer of white that makes most life dormant or sluggish during winter.  And when the characters arrived in Florida, it almost took me back to my childhood days when my family and I would arrive, by car, to some small town somewhere in America during summer; it brought to me that same sort of mild despair and disorientation that returning home from the family roadtrip always inspired.  And, I dont know, there's something then altogether tragic about Florida in winter anyway.  There's an eternal longing in these characters and I think we can feel it even more because of the landscapes Jarmusch used in this film.  A Florida motel in winter, with the sun beating down; and Cleveland, during the same winter, soulless and icy.Beautiful, beautiful film and it's hard to stop commenting on the feelings it brings out.

The film features the relaxed atmosphere that Jarmusch is famous for creating, and it also looks the part with its silky black and white picture...but as a film, it's not all that good. The relaxed plot is far too relaxed to the point of boredom, and none of the three central performers manage to lift the film above the norm. Much of the film simply sees the characters sitting around talking, and their conversations aren't exactly fascinating. There is a sense of irony, especially regarding the ending; but other than that, the film doesn't show a lot of intelligence either. This film apparently started out as a thirty minute short; and that sounds about right, as it all feels very stretched and that's unfortunate, as it would have made a fairly decent short film. The plot simply follows a Hungarian man in New York who receives an unwelcome visit from his cousin. Jarmusch doesn't do a very good job of portraying his characters, and we don't get to learn much about them from their conversations. The only real positive element of this film as far as I can see is the cinematography, which really does look good. Overall, this is a rather dull and pretentious film that looks good.

He has chosen to cut himself off from his origins, but his assimilation into U.S. culture has led exactly to nowhere. When his teenage cousin comes to visit, fresh from Budapest, Willie's isolation becomes all the more evident. The silences between the two speak volumes. Aunt Lotte, the most appealing character, represents the vitality missing in Willie.

But there is a big section of cinema lovers who admire films that are different and distinct from the usual mainstream products that you get at the theaters, and they absolutely love his films, idolise him and get inspired by his work. I belong to the latter category. 'Down By Law' is one of my favourite films of all time. Stranger than Paradise was the first film that made Jarmusch popular in the critics' circles and the film festivals. This film like his others has his distinct style all over it and is a joy to watch.Jarmusch is one of the masters of deadpan comedies. In a very characteristic way, Stranger Than Paradise is a quiet, brooding film where nothing big of mind-blowing magnitude happens. Characters are all very down to earth, casual individuals who get on with their lives without making a big fuss. The flat storyline involves Eva, a Hungarian girl who comes to America and would have stayed with her Aunt Lotte, but due to her illness is forced to stay with her cousin Willie in his apartment in New York. Willie is an archetypal hipster. He has made a conscious effort to relinquish his Hungarian background and identity and accepted the American way of life because he thinks that's cool, he is not social, he spends all of his time in his small, cosy apartment, he eats junk food, plays cards and has no desire to explore the world. When Eva arrives, we can clearly see a wall between the two characters due to their contrasting views of the world, culture and even just plain routines and habits. Although they both find it difficult to adjust to each others' ways, Willie gradually becomes fond of Eva and starts to accept her, while Eva who initially wanted to be friendly with Willie gradually drifts apart due to his demeanour. When Eva leaves to stay with her Aunt, Willie genuinely ends up feeling lonely and becomes quite sceptical about the prospect of having to go back to his lonely life. Eddie is a friend of Willie who acts as a form of a bridge between Willie and Eva. He actually got on with Eva better than Willie. 1 year after Eva's departure, both Willie and Eddie completely fed up and bored with their uneventful lives decide to head to Cleveland where Eva was staying with her aunt. Now a standard film would have shown how Eva makes Willie have a different outlook on the world and change his attitude towards his own life and it would have become a very predictable Hollywood coming of age comedy film. But Jarmusch is anything but standard and predictable. What follows after that is utterly profound and enlightening, but even then it never loses its casual, deadpan style.The central theme of the film I think is the achievement of happiness or fulfillment. People tend to imagine this ideal state that they want to be in and this ideal, heavenly life in paradise that they want to live which leaves them with feelings of dissatisfaction and depression. They tend to chase this life and this dream which they chase throughout their lives, but even when they achieve it, it turns out to be not much different to the lives that they were already leading, just shinier with more material belongings and so there is really no point in chasing anything and genuine fulfillment can't be found. So the film in a way delves a bit in elements of Nihilism. Jarmusch like many other filmmaking auteurs manages to find some optimism in the midst of this pessimism and ends on an optimistic note rather than fashioning and artificially manufacturing a happy ending out of nowhere just for the sake of it.The cinematography of this film reminded me so heavily of French New Wave films of the 1950s and 1960s, specially Godard's 'Masculin Féminin'. There is very little editing. Jarmusch uses these long shots and allows the camera to stay still and focus on the characters. It is extremely understated and the whole film depends and revolves around the mood that Jarmusch creates. This film can be aptly described as a moody, hypnotic comedy. Very little happens on screen, but everything gets revealed through little glances that the actors use and soft, short lines spoken by characters and the visuals. The acting by the three major actors namely John Lurie, Eszter Balint and Richard Edson (who reminded me of Robert de Niro as Johnny Boy in 'Mean Streets') is understated, nuanced, but very effective for a film of this style. Stranger Than Paradise is certainly not a film for everyone. People who expect fast paced films where a lot of things happen will feel infinitely disappointed with this. But I love directors who make no compromise with their films and stay true to their art and style. Stranger Than Paradise is a deep and meaningful film that demands patience and attention from the viewers. It had a huge impact on the American Independent Film scene and for this it deserves even more praise, specially considering that it got released at a time during which Americans could see nothing other than Star Wars, Indiana Jones and other big budget studio bonanzas. It gave promise and hope to budding filmmakers in America that they could also make films of a different variety and not give in to the pressures of the studios and the Box Office.

At first I felt sorry for the woman, because she seemed trapped by the whims and the stupid decisions of her cousin and his idiot friend. But then she does something near the end of the film that, while it's understandable, erased all the goodwill I had built up towards her. Also, I cannot understand how any of the three adults in this story could think it would be acceptable to leave an elderly aunt living alone in a god-awful snowy city with apparently no friends and very little English-speaking ability. I thought it was heartless. I felt the woman, as an actress and as a real person, would have never ever accepted the insults and stupidity she was presented with, but she willed herself to do it for whatever minor paycheck she received. For a while I was getting into the Twilight Zone spartan environment of it all. The empty streets and landscapes. The desolation, the isolation, the overwhelming deadliness of these people's lives. But since the two men in particular seemed just mind-bogglingly stupid, it was hard to care for one second what happened to them. In fact, the only person who actually seemed to have any definable feelings was Billy the young man who apparently had a crush on the Hungarian cousin. I do not know why this has received the raves it has received. If you want to stare for 90 minutes at shoddy black and white footage, of scenes that are cut unnaturally, of dialog that is painfully and obviously improvised in hopes of finding a common thread that makes sense, if you want to invest your emotional energy into people that really don't deserve it (although the female character does... she just doesn't end up being smart enough to get out while she can), then, please, go ahead and have the time of your life. When it ended so abruptly and unbelievably , it just left me with a sick pit in my stomach. If this is what people call art, then I still have a chance to pursue my creative dreams, which, yes, I believe are far superior to this leaden fake film. "},{"Title":"LOVE this film!  NY Grunge, Cleveland Snow, Florida Blues!  Paprikash, anyone?","Date":"7 January 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" What a great film! Loved it, even before I saw it, watching it's quirky trailer at the art house theater near Lincoln Center, where the film eventually played for well over a year in the 80s. Seeing it again today, it felt just as fresh, funny, familiar, endearing, charming and goofy as the first time I saw it so many years ago. Boring? Heck no!!! Different? You Bet!!! BUT it also feels more like real life than all the reality shows on TV these days! Why I love this film1. The film maker obviously loves the character's he's created -- from Willie's newly Americanized con-man wannabe, who has very real affection and love for his cousin, to his goof-ball best pal, Eddie, who has a heart of gold, to the shy, but ultimately sincere and down- to-earth Eva, mature and self-aware. They form a strong bond, simply by being with each other, simply by hanging out, simply out of human desire to connect with each other -- to not be alone. And the audience also shares, identifies with, and cares about the characters with all their idiosyncrasies and quirkiness. We are captivated, and in this sense, the movie, often described as being avant-garde or minimalist, has a surprisingly old-fashioned feel to it!2. Aunt Lotte! Those of us who are 2nd Generation Americans, with grand parents who got off the boat in Ellis Island, sure remember Grand Parents who were just like Aunt Lotte. From the accent, to the comfortable, dowdy furnishings in her home, to the mountains of food offered to EVERYBODY who visits their homes -- plates of kielbasa, and sausage, and stuffed cabbage and the glorious Chicken Paprikash, to the heated temper they can possess, to the knowledge of the appropriate American cuss words. The character of Aunt Lotte is beyond real!! And consequently, hilarious.3. The look and feel of the older, more run-down, nondescript sections of NYC at the height of it's grimy, crummy glory, in the late 70s, early 80s with all the crime, and garbage, before the encroaching Disneyfication, gentrification, and sanitization of Manhattan! Of course it's better now, but this film shows that under-belly side of urban/non-touristy NYC, with pure realism.4. The look and feel of the older, more run-down, nondescript sections of freezing cold Cleveland in the midst of a good old fashioned snowy winter, with the bitter cold winds blowing off of Lake Erie. This, folks, is Cleveland in January!5. The look and feel of the older, more run-down, nondescript sections of Florida with the endless budget motels, lining the Yellow Brick Roads to Miami, Fort Lauderdale and Orlando. As beautiful as much of Florida is, lots and lots of Florida -- looks like this!6. Priceless scenes like Willie's sincere analysis and description of American TV dinners, to the silly Poker Game, where Willie and Eddie's rather awkward and juvenile cheat is exposed, to the hilarious Kung Fu Film seen by our 3 protagonists plus Eva's boyfriend wannabe. Only hearing the film, with the camera trained on the audience, we can remember every single cheap, Bruce Lee rip-off we watched in the budget theaters in the 70s and 80s, complete with endless action and crappy music.7. The structure of the the film from the small individual blackouts -- simple, seemingly fragmentary, but actually very carefully calibrated scenes which serve as glimpses and sort of cinema-like selfies without the traditional arc of a cinematic scene. Just as effective -- just as revelatory, and actually nice and succinct. 8. There is even an old-fashioned sense of a story, with very real suspense created in the final part of the film in Florida. I remember sitting on the edge of my seat the last 10 or 15 minutes wondering how this was all going to resolve itself. And here's the spoiler It does resolve itself and it doesn't at the same time! Cool! i was fascinated how the movie's structure is so carefully worked out! Throughout most of the movie, we have 3 characters tied at the hip together, UNTIL the very last scene when all 3 go in very separate ways, though of course not by choice. This is a film that consequently makes you think as well!! Amazing!!9. The genuinely satisfying humor -- sometimes even laugh-out-loud (Aunt Lottie; Eva's disposal of Willie's gift to her that he was so proud of; that Kung Fu movie) It was all ultimately good-natured, and even though the film ends a bit wistfully, the overall feeling is one of having enjoyed getting to know the characters, sharing their experiences, and laughing -- well not with them, but certainly at them!10. Screamin' Jay Hawkins and his rendition of I Put a Spell on You MASTERFUL of Jim Jarmusch to include this raucous, hokey, wild tune as the leitmotif of the film! Jim Jarmusch puts a spell on us with this truly remarkable and justly lauded film!! It's both a time capsule of America in the later 20th century, and an enduring tale and character study for the ages!

It was only the opening scene, but the visual style grabbed me right away. The grainy black and white, looking not like a 1980s feature film but rather newsreel of some mid-century atrocity, the long opening shot of Eszter Balint's Eva walking away from the airport like an angel of death, the almost-surreal scene of her walking through the streets blaring I Put A Spell On You... it stuck with me. A few years later, I finally got around to watching the film in its entirety. The visual style fades after a while and becomes invisible in the way cinematography tends to. But what emerges in its place is a slow but devastating character drama.Stranger than Paradise is really about the immigrant experience in America. In this way it is a strange, low-key response to The Godfather. Whereas Coppola saw the story of the immigrant as one of struggle, seduction, and eventual corruption -- a Hollywood tragedy, in other words -- Jarmusch argues that it is a grind, an endless procession of ungrateful relatives, incomprehensible television, dead-end jobs, and the slow realization that no matter where you go, the banality of real life is always there ahead of you.Jarmusch was a pioneer in independent American cinema. The style of Stranger than Paradise is echoed in any of the countless mumblecore films that deal with the mundanity of contemporary existence (and perhaps existence in general). It is frequently a boring film, mainly because it is about boredom and its omnipresence. Certainly it could be aesthetically improved, so that the dialogue and the characters have the same artistic grace as the cinematography. But somehow I like Stranger than Paradise just as it is. Instead of the catharsis of Hollywood, it leaves the viewer with an emptiness, a strange hole in their gut that they can't quite figure out what to do with. But maybe that hole was always there, and the film only cast a revelatory light on it.

He is surprised -- and not very happy -- when his cousin Eva shows up from Hungary for a visit. He doesn't want anything to do with the Hungarian language or the old country.Willie is pretty hostile in the beginning, but he and his friend Eddie (Richard Edson) take her along with them (though they continually try to ditch her) on their big road trip, which starts at Aunt Lotte's (Cecillia Stark) house in Cleveland. There they play cards with Aunt Lotte declaring herself de vinner. Then it's on to Florida, and here's where the story develops a couple of neat twists.This film was made for $90,000 and is considered incredibly successful as it earned something like 20+ times its budget. The photography is stark in black and white and the locations finally elicit an hysterical observation from Eva.Stranger than Paradise has quirky comedy and a quirky outlook, typical of Jarmusch. There's an underlying feeling of quiet loneliness throughout as the three misfits look, but don't seem to know what they're looking for. The film is set in the '80s, both Willie and Eva don't dress like it, and seem to fit in well with Aunt Lotte's old-fashioned European decor.Though Jarmusch's characters are often a little wacky, you can't help but like them or empathize with them. The story and characters of Stranger Than Paradise are oddly unforgettable as Eva looks at America and thinks, so what? And given what she sees, you can't blame her.

Willie- our hero- is disgusted when he first meets Eva&#x85; he seems to be in denial of his Hungarian heritage and ashamed of his family. But she slowly, quietly makes an impression on him, and when she leaves New York for Cleveland, Willie and his friend Eddie- the wonderful Richard Edson- make their way to see her.She is stuck, Americanized, working in a hot dog stand, living with an elderly Aunt who is either unable or unwilling to speak English. Eva tells the fellows that she would like to be rescued and kidnapped because she hates her life, so the trio ventures down to the paradise of Florida.There was a very obvious choice made by Director Jim Jarmusch to have minimal dialogue, which adds to the film's deliberate, unpolished feel, but just as often seems completely unrealistic. For such a stark, proudly-independent feel Jarmusch employs a brazen deus ex machina to resolve the dead-end storyline Eva is simply walking along the street when a jive-talking black man hands her an envelope stuffed with cash. Is this her reward for being a Screaming Jay Hawkins fan? I don't think so.The movie came to a perfect ending Willie boards the plane, rejecting America, rejecting the culture that drove him to become a card sharp and gambler, and returns to Budapest where he will finally embrace his roots and true identity and start life over. The final shot is Eva returning to her Florida hotel room. Maybe she has to subject herself to more suffering and loneliness in the States before she is able to make the same transformation. Stranger Than Paradise is thought-provoking and entirely original, and that alone makes it worth seeing.GRADE B- "}{"Title":"an acquired taste, to say the least","Date":"5 January 2011","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" This cool to distraction cult favorite introduced art house audiences to the minimalism of writer director Jim Jarmusch, who in his breakthrough feature walks a fine line between tedium and hilarity.

This is an undemanding, entertaining little film that relies most heavily on its actors' fine performances.Willie (jazz musician John Lurie) is a hipster, at least as much of one as 1984 had to offer. He lives in a tiny, tiny apartment in New York, and he's expecting his cousin Eva (Eszter Balint, recently seen in a story arc on Louie) to arrive from Hungary and spend the night before heading to Ohio to live with their aunt. But poor Aunt Dottie (Cecillia Stark) will be in the hospital for the next fortnight, so Eva necessarily crashes with Willie. Willie's miffed that his blossoming (untrue) social life will take a hit with Eva around, and he treats his cousin with some scorn, like an unwanted puppy. Soon, Willie's friend Eddie (Richard Edson) shows up, and he's a kinder, gentler (if submissive) version of Willie.In the second act, Eva has left for Ohio, but after a year the guys miss her and, after winning some money in a fixed poker game, head out to visit. But, bored (again) with Ohio, they head to Florida with Eva for some deserved rest and relaxation.One of the most intriguing aspects of this superficially uncomplex film is the way the trio's interrelationships develop. Willie becomes more tolerant of Eva, to the point where he's willing to drive from New York to Ohio to visit. And as time progresses, Willie and Eddie are more on even ground with each other (Eddie becomes more assertive).This isn't a movie about nothing, but it's a close approximation. Lurie and Balint mesh well together. Balint's Eva is neither a shrinking violet (being new to the country and all) nor a pugnacious harridan. She's smarter than she looks - and certainly wiser than Willie and Eddie. But the other two aren't one dimensional, either, as Jarmusch's efficient script allows each to grow and to communicate so much by saying so little.Stranger Than Paradise is a beautiful little movie, filmed in black and white to better illustrate the inevitable hopelessness the characters endure. It's one of those cases in which less is truly more, as Jarmusch's immersive atmosphere lightly complements the strong acting from the three leads. "},{"Title":"Stranger Than Paradise is... well it simply 'Is', and therein lies its beauty","Date":"15 May 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" Long lingering conversations, shots held for much longer than is necessary, and a plot that really goes nowhere Stranger Than Paradise has all of the hallmarks to make it an art-house auteur classic, but don't mistake Jarmusch's flair for pretension. In fact the lingering shots and stunted conversations found in this film are anything but pretentious, rather they are the core of realism in cinema.We film lovers have long been trained in what to expect from a movie dialogue has a natural sounding progression that moves us from plot point A to plot point B, characters have motivations that make sense, and stories go forward with an easy momentum. Stranger Than Paradise, contrary to these established modes of film making, just lets events, characters, and dialogue unfold in a manner much more similar to the real world than most other films. Conversations are not directed and shots are not carefully constructed and edited, rather the viewer feels like a fly on the wall as this collection of bored characters try to find something (anything) to talk about.The plot revolves (like many of Jarmusch's movies) around a cast of outsiders drifting aimlessly through life. Willie (John Lurie) is a bored New Yorker with a gambling habit, Eva (Ezter Balint) is his Hungarian immigrant cousin, and Eddie (Richard Edson) is their hopelessly optimistic tag-along friend, and our story follows these three as they travel through their dull lives making an issue out of everything.The actual plot, however, takes a backseat the real goings on in this film. The boredom and pointlessness is not meant to entertain in any usual way, but rather to force the viewer into a mode of existential thinking. These characters are not searching for entertainment or action (although they think they are), they are simply searching for themselves all over America. What does it mean to be an American? Jarmusch is asking of us, and furthermore, what does it mean to simply 'be'?Stranger Than Paradise provides no answers to these questions, but it does give a deep insight into the issues at hand. Like every single shot the characters fade in, exist for a time, and then fade out. Nothing is achieved, nothing is accomplished, thing just are. And that is where the beauty of the movie lies; in its simple act of existing.I suppose that some might find the whole thing pointless, and I would agree to an extent, but those who dismiss this film for its pointlessness are in for a very heated argument indeed. It's true that this is not the movie you want to throw in the player when you are looking forward to an evening of mindless entertainment with friends, but that doesn't lessen the movie's impact at all. It is a commitment to lock yourself into the film and really work your way through the melange of useless conversation and dead-pan editing, but I would say that it is well worth the effort. There is just so much to be gained from watching this film with an open mind and taking in the sheer beauty of its bared souls.

But Paradise? Well, that's such a remote word that few give it a moment's thought, except the religious of course. Well, here's Jim Jarmusch's answer for all those who suffer from Paradise-deprived angst it's right in front of you. Everyday. That's all there is, pilgrim.The story traces the quite uneventful days of three main characters Willie (John Lurie), a cheap hustler who tries to get by, any way he can this side of the law; Eddie (Richard Edson), his friend, a somewhat dull-witted, guileless sort of guy who just wants to please; and Eva (Eszter Balint), Willie's cousin who unexpectedly arrives from Hungary on her way to visit her old aunt in Cleveland, Ohio.Eva stays a few days with Willie, meets Eddie, sits and watches TV with Willie for hours on end, cleans up his apartment, Willie buys her a dress and, a day later, Eva leaves to go to Cleveland, dumping the dress Willie bought for her in a trash can while Eddie looks on. Not a scintillating story line at all, according to a review I read a while back. But, wait there's more&#133; A year after Eva leaves, Willie and Eddie decide to visit her in Cleveland, and after a long trip by auto, they both arrive to stay with Willie's aunt and renew their acquaintance with Eva. After a few days' sightseeing in the frozen north, so to speak, with Eddie's not-so-memorable summation of a frozen Lake Erie It's beautiful, Willie invites Eva to go with them to Florida. She agrees, much to the old aunt's disgust and anger. As they leave, she mutters, Son of a bitch!So, is this a road movie in disguise? Well, we know that Jim Jarmusch loves autos, roads and cities because all of his movies (except Deadman) include those modern icons so indicative of America and the post-industrial world. So, it is one, in that in a sense, but now it's really about Willie and Eddie wanting to make a lot of money &#150; the Great American Dream -- on the betting tracks in Florida. And Eva is no doubt attracted by the thought of money also.After another relatively long sequence of shots on freeways, they end up at a motel, on a beach, somewhere on the Florida coast. The next morning the guys go off to the dog track, leaving Eva asleep. When they come back, almost broke, Willie's browned off with Eddie for suggesting it, Eddie's browned off by Willie's attitude and Eva's browned off with both of them for being left alone. Willie, with Eddie, then takes the last fifty bucks to the horses, wins big and comes back to celebrate. However&#133; To say any more would be to reveal just how Jim Jarmusch injects his own special brand of chaos and irony in all of his movies. And, if you've come this far in this review, I'd recommend you see it.I loved this movie the great acting, the B/W photography, the strident and discordant music, the sharp cuts to black, the sparse and so very ordinary dialog. It was so ordinary, and yet promised so much to the players and all players who are looking for their own Paradise. But, Paradise is but a dream, and our realities are truly stranger.

I have never heard of something more stupid in all my life. A character driven movie about two friends and a girl from out of town who escape from absolutely nothing to find absolutely nothing is the most ridiculous movie concept I have ever heard of. To make matters worse, I couldn't get to know the characters very well, so there was no way to sympathize with how they were feeling about being in the situation that they were in. It was particularly hard to sympathize with them when they really didn't show the kind of exaggerated emotions that you normally see in a film to help you easily recognize what the hell is going on. There are purists who would say that, that was the whole point. To have an incredible depth of realism. To immerse yourself in the movie so far that then you would sympathize with the characters, because you finally are getting in touch with what they are going through. But really when is anyone really that strung up in a film, especially about three friends from Jersey who go to Florida to escape the monotony of their lives only to find that they have to go home because they have no money. The other reason I disliked the film was there was no point even some of the most experimental films have a plot that goes somewhere and characters who are driving the movie though the story and bringing it to its logical or inevitable ending. There was no one behind the wheel of this movie. In this movie all there was, was a half drunken idiot behind the wheel of a Gremlin, traveling around in no particular direction. Even story edicate wasn't followed. The highs and lows making way to a dramatic and logical conclusion. Nope not there just the story of these people doing' stuff. But I digress.In the movie however are some intriguing moments of sexual tension between first cousins and friends as well as a great amount of fantastic photography I think that the movie was incredibly shot but that the movie just wasn't entertaining, and no matter how much a film is art, even the most obscure Picaso painting or, Fallini film is entertaining and thats just what I didn't get out of this film entertainment.

You know, sometimes you're in a situation and you stop and think How did I get here? or What am I doing here?.  Stranger Than Paradise captured those situations very well both at the Aunt's house and at the Florida motel room.  But overall, it just sort of plodded along relatively unfocused, and couldn't keep me consistently focused.(No spoilers)  I wasn't really into the film as a whole until the very end.  As the events of the last few minutes unfolded, my interest perked up.  In the end, when I fully realized what had happened, I thought wow.  These other comments have paid surprisingly little attention to this film's ending, which I find surprising.  It is the best part of the film, and it makes sitting through it worth it.  In an era where Hollywood seems to be relying more and more on twist and surprise endings that come from nowhere, this one is refreshing in that (in retrospect), it was full of subtle buildup to the end and didn't rely on gimmicks to produce it. A pretty good film with a great and memorable ending.  Take it for what it's worth.

He lives in a dilapidated inner-city apartment, has no apparent means of employment, chain smokes Chesterfields and for entertainment he plays Solitaire, sits in front of the TV for hours, and hangs out with his equally dull friend Eddie (Richard Edson). Willie's teenage cousin Eva comes to visit him from Hungary before moving to her grandmother's in Cleveland. Willie and Eddie decide to go to Cleveland to visit them and find it to be equally boring and even colder. Then they take Eva to Florida with them and don't find it any better either, except the weather. This film is a real gem and takes a funny satirical look into the lives of some everyday common people finding the grass is not greener wherever they move to or visit.

Like any good work of art, STP tries to get us to see the familiar in an unfamiliar way, such that our understanding of the every-day is deepened. So I'm tempted to say that anyone willing to look through Jarmusch's novel spectacles will be rewarded, while those insisting on a more conventional approach will turn away in disgust. But perhaps the results are not as simple as that. After all, who would want to sit through a double feature that extends the listlessness and minimalism to 3 hour duration. STP may have moments of real insight such as the dead-end diner, nevertheless as cinematic style, the limitations are obvious. (Andy Warhol's eight hours of fixed focus on a Manhattan skyscraper may be a profound idea, but as repeatable cinema the limitations are even more obvious.) Still and all, this one-of-a kind is salvaged by its droll humor. By any measure, it's an exquisite example of existential comedy. The zombified characters simply cannot communicate with one another and as a result are reduced to co-existing in darkly humorous fashion, carrying their mute fumblings from one seedy locale to another, (the ridiculous pork-pie hats are a brilliant comedic touch). And not even that most American of solutions, a big wad of money, helps; in fact the sudden windfall produces a final physical separation, both amusingly ironic and unexpectedly poignant. Apparently, Jarmusch intends this on-going isolation as a musing on the so-called human condition, since a number of scenes are filmed against featureless horizons. But whatever the over-all intention, this 'Buster Keaton meets Ingmar Bergman' oddity remains a classic of deadpan understatement. And though most of us are a lot more talkative than the three principals, I wonder--when you get right down to it which Jarmusch does--if we communicate any more effectively.

Then this dream existence is disrupted when his cousin Eva arrives from Hungary to stay with him until she can move on to stay with her aunt Lottie in Cleveland, after Lotte has recovered from surgery. The first part of the movie deals with how Willie and Eddie integrate Eva into their spectacularly uneventful lives.Eva moves on to Cleveland and we resume the story a year later when Willie and Eddie get the great idea of driving to Cleveland, in the dead of winter no less. The only scenes with much energy in them are provided by Aunt Lotte, who speaks mostly in Hungarian and has more life in her than any of the others, and believe me that is not saying much. Well, the trio sees that being in Cleveland is going nowhere so they continue their search for paradise in Florida, where they basically continue the lives they have had everywhere else, except now they are operating out of a run-down motel instead of a run-down apartment or a run-down house. If the message is that ordinary people tend to establish the same lives for themselves no matter where they are, then I wish I had not had to endure this film to get that point.The grainy black and white, static photography is appropriate--it simply accentuates the dreariness of the whole affair.I suppose the fact I stuck it out to the end is one of the most positive things I can say about this thing. The technique of telling the story through a sequence of vignettes separated by fades to black is of interest, but I never find it a good sign when the techniques are more interesting that the story.The movie is not without its small moments of humor. Anyone who has had a vacation go bad can identify with the scene where Willie, Eddie, and Eva decide to take a trip to see Lake Erie. The three stand there on an observation deck in a cold wind looking onto a frozen barrenness. A metaphor for their lives?

The story is separated into sixty seven fragments. A black screen separates each of these sixty-seven fragments. So, we can say that fade to black in this film is widely used. Actually, these fade to blacks are not common in contemporary films.The style of 'Stranger than paradise' is rather minimalist. First of all, there is a lot silence in this film. As one commentator observed `The most fascinating aspect of 'Stranger than paradise' is indeed the fact that it communicates so much with so little.' And also Jim Jarmusch, said `That's what I like most about that film (indicating Stranger Than Paradise) the moments between dialogue when you understand what's happening between people without them saying anything.' In most films, the scenes in which the characters basically don't do anything are cut off. But in this film, we even see the scenes in which, nothing actually happens. As for this reason, the audience of this film cannot determine what's going to happen. When talking about this aspect of the film, Jim Jarmusch says `If you stop the film at any point and ask the audience what was going to happen next, they would have no idea. They wouldn't really be thinking about it, but would be more concerned with the characters and what's happening to them'Camera shots in 'Stranger than paradise' is quite simple. Camera movement is kept to minimum. Other than the tracking scene at the beginning of the film, the camera movements are very rare. Most of the time the camera is a motionless observational camera. Shots in the film are usually open frame. The audience can view people coming in and out of the frame. This makes the film rather realistic.In the end, I can only say that, only because of its distinctive style, its worth watching "},{"Title":"Well...interesting","Date":"12 February 2005","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" OK, i'm a big fan of Jim Jarmusch. I think he's creative, deep, spiritual, sincere, stylish and he's very conscious about what he can do with cinema. Dead Man and Ghost DogThe Way Of The Samurai are two of my favorite movies of all time. I had to watch this movies for my contemporary cinema class. Right off the bat I was deeply interested.Quite honestly I expected more of a breakthrough effort. I was not appealed by the problematics of immigration, but that's my problem. This movie is way too similar to other movies I've seen on one theme Submission to history. The characters are alienated by some historical issues and seem to be blocked wherever they go. This ain't nothing new. From Rosselini to Ming Liang, there is a truck load of movies treating the same ever subject. I'm sick and tired of immobility and nothingness as an aesthetic value in contemporary cinema.But...Jarmusch is Jarmusch. It can never be that bad. The movie is visually very appealing. The black and white contrasts makes the immigrant duo and their friend look like three stains on a pure white land. The theme of isolation is also talked about, but not very deeply.The ending is also beautiful. Camus, Sartre or any existentialist philosopher couldn't phrase better the absurdity of life. It was interesting, but far from being my favorite Jarmusch. Glad to see, though , that he went further than a lot of director who consider themselves modern.

It remains to this day one of my all time favorite films. Jim Jarmusch's creativity and unpretentiousness is at its absolute raw finest. Though not much really happens, the characters draw you in with their absolute unassuming grace. This movie reminds me a little bit of Wim Wender's Paris Texas. Sometimes you just can't putyour finger on what makes something so special. This movie is sort oflike that, in that you just have to see for yourself the genius behind this work. People with attention deficit disorder may not get the beauty, but for all you true lovers of film,I highly recommend this one. Oh, and by the way, Richard Edson is too cool for words.

In addition, Willie (John Lurie) sits in his apartment, talks to his grandmother on the phone, Cousin Eva (Eszter Balint) shows up, and somehow everyone gets to hang out.  At one point, Willie's pal, Eddie (Richard Edison) somehow joins them and they have a road trip. As for style and substance, Jim Jarmusch is definitely hip.  There's a few sequences in this picture where he rolls with the characters and gets good results.  For instance, in one spot, the cousin strolls through New York playing a killer version of I Put A Spell on You on her old school tape deck; another time, the characters simply stand around their car on a frigid day, commenting on a lake that we can't even see. In fact, there's a bit of WAITING FOR GODOT in this picture; going around in circles, waiting for a change, nothing happening, etc.Nonetheless, I didn't relate to the material, regardless of its artistic merit or quality.  Still, I'm sure there are plenty of folk (especially people that like long takes with little dialogue) that will enjoy this film, talk about it immensely, and say how amazing it is.  Unfortunately, I will be not be one of them.

Aunt Lotte makes me lmao. She uses almost no gestures and speaks without articulating. I am half Hungarian myself and she reminds me of my own grandmother and all those old aunts in the small villages out on the countryside in Hungary. Some other scenes are also hysterical funny, though they are not many enough for this film to be called merely a comedy. It's funny, but it's also more than just a comedy.Anyway, this movie is about two fellas in NY that do nothing but watch TV, smoke, play cards and bet on horses. In other words they waste a lot of time instead of getting a job. This film shows the backsides of the new world. It's pessimistic but at the same time entertaining. At one occasion Eddie says Cleveland looks just like NY, with it's slushy and industrial areas. Is there a slight touch of social criticism? Regarding the acting, the dialogues fall extremely natural. It's realistic and well played.4 / 5 "}{"Title":"The quintessential independent movie of the 80's.","Date":"11 October 2001","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  If you reckon yourself an independent film buff, Stranger Than Paradise needs to be a movie you've seen before you can rank yourself as, at least, a semi-pro indie buff. The realness of these characters is amazing. The dialogue is unmatched, and by being down-to-earth, you feel for these characters as if you know them. The simplistic (genius) camera work in this film deserves a lot more recognition than it gets. But keeping this film out of recognition's way is how the independent people like it. So watch it, love it, and keep it to yourself!

Some people, like Jim Jarmusch, don't believe in anything. So he brought his nihilistic point of view into his film Stranger Than Paradies. This film shows the human - being as a meaningless existence in an empty world which is a little bit Stanger than paradies!!! The emptiness in this world and so in these young humans life is demonstrated in several parts of the film The streets of this world are empty - all the others are not useful, 'cause they don't know'em anyway, so Jim left them out; the life of the people, like Willie, is empty he's sitting the whole day-time in his dirty room watching TV, betting on horses. The real life takes place on the movie or the TV - screen! Watch it! v How boring this life you think? You are not living like that! Repent yourself! I guess nearly all the people live somehow like that. But Willie is getting a chance his cousin is coming from the poorer hungary longing for a new better life in the land of the 1000 opporunities; she`s disturbing willie's whole life. Every scene makes us expecting that something is happening, that there is something, the something special we're all looking for in our live. but then the scenes end, and nothing has happened. Anything really special happened in your life so far? What are you still expecting? Want loads of money? So do the young guys They get money! Now they expect something great Florida - sunshine. But when they get there there's nothing different to NY. They don't know what to do in there lifes! Even when they lose their money and get a new chance by the black deus ex macchina. No life is absurd - it's empty and meaningless! This world is, aswell as I think, godless,  comunicationless and stranger than paradies. An excellent movie So Mr. Jarmusch, if you liked my comment, give me a role in one of your next films, then my life would eb better!!! Thanks a lot!WERNER "},{"Title":"bleak, depressing, and perfect","Date":"24 June 2005","Score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" When I first watched this movie, it had a strong impact on me. I was left with the comforting notion that there are people who share my outlook. I am referring to Jarmusch, of course - not the characters in this movie.Feeling understood while watching such a depressing film obviously says much about me. But this is exactly what I've found to be the case when it comes to this movie People who are generally thought of as optimists and fun-loving, chipper folks, seem to have a very difficult time sitting through this movie. In fact, it appears to outrage them. It has angered friends of mine, who strongly reject to what Jarmusch is stating or insinuating with this film.If you have ever felt alienated and lost, check out this movie. Its bleak outlook cheered me up.

Like many arthouse films which use art as an excuse for the absence of things which cost money like COLOR, this Jarmish artie slogs tediously from scene to scene without anything interesting happening thereby making the point that nothing is happening and emphasizing the dull, sublunary, and unhappening life of the protagonists. Jamrsh does an excellent job with his lens in capturing the ordinariness of his characters and succeeds in showing the audience how very ordinary his characters are. If you like this film, you may want to check out a similar but better film and Ashley Judd's breakthrugh film, Ruby in Paradise (1993).

I didn't know it was going to look like a stage play. Which is okay. I shoot a lot of stage plays for the local High School my kids attend. This is truly an indie film. More or less an avant-garde. It reminds me of the old TV series like the Jackie Gleason show where the camera just shoot one angle with no close-ups or insert shots. It kept my attention, but it did kinda drag a bit. On the scale of 1-10 I would give it an 8 for the simple reason this was Jim's first movie and I am a filmmaker also. It is good to be an indie filmmaker because you can shoot what you visualize.San Diego, Ca Indie Filmmaker "},{"Title":"Boring, Over-rated, crummy dialogue. Usually a line I keep for commercial junk.

Before I had seen that though, I saw a 'history of independent film' doc on IFC and it made Jarmusch seem like an underground god, so I was excited to see that my Tivo saved this for me.Argh. With total honesty (check out my reviews) I believe that the Matrix had better dialogue, better direction (camera placement but most importantly telling non professional actors what to do b/c they havent a clue), better storyline, better everything.  The matrix is a better art house movie (I saw Ghost in the Shell on bootleg in france 6 months after it came out in Nippon so I dont want to here it) than stranger than paradise.It does NOT examine any characters. John Lurie is sleazy.  w/in the first 1minute you meet him.  Do we learn why? nooooo. do we learn anything? no. f**king half the movie is silence. and since its not used well (the silence) it means that it is poor film making, not just 'student'.I cant go into it. It is just a lame movie. I gave it a four. I dare someone to give a review outlining POINT BY POINT, or SCENE BY SCENE why this deserve to get higher than a four.
