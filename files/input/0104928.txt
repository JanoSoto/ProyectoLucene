While watching it, it becomes clear quickly that making this movie is a real labour of love for Crystal.  He really displays his entire range in this surprising drama about a rather complex Vaudeville-esque comedian (whose character Buddy Young Jr. was introduced years before during Crystal's unforgettable stint on the 1984-5 Saturday Night Live season).  Perhaps I was just in the mood for a sentimental film while I was watching it, but I was really compelled by the film, which also featured an unbelievable performance by David Paymer as Crystal's brother.  The flashback sequences were fabulous-- I just can't say enough good about this film.  Just don't set your expectations for a comedy, remember this is a rather long, sentimental (yet never sappy) drama with comic elements and enjoy!

This is not a comedy. This is a very moving drama about a comedian and his life, both public and private. There are several highly insightful moments and some real movie magic present. I assume Crystal had help with his directing, as there are a few crafty camera shots. I personally don't mind that most critics overlooked this movie, but I am very glad that the Academy recognized David Paymer, as Crystal's watching-from-the-wings brother, with a Best Supporting Actor nomination. He and Crystal play off each other wonderfully. They act so much like brothers throughout the years of the film, Paymer's last name might actually be Crystal.Helen Hunt, Ron Silver, and Jerry Orbach have good roles, albeit fairly small. There are also several cameos, including Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel. They co-wrote the movie with Crystal, and this duo have their names on Happy Days episodes, as well as a slew of films. This information is helpful to the humor when they appear as a couple of goofy young writers.This fine film is not without a couple of drawbacks. The make-up job on Crystal and Paymer in their old age is far from realistic. This aspect of the film needed Rick Baker. The other item that detracts this from being a truly great film is that it is essentially a biography of a fictional person who isn't a very nice guy. The movie has a few moments where it wants the viewer to feel sorry for him for ruining his own life. To me, however, it is great storytelling and wonderful acting. It is sad, poignant, and, upon first viewing in 1992, nothing I expected from the mind of Billy Crystal.If you've never seen this picture because you have heard too many negative things, please give it a viewing. You could very well be surprised.

It doesn't have the makings of a big box office hit.  This is a hilarious film, and I laughed nonstop, but it's not entirely a comedy.  It has a great human element.  Not your usual Hollywood fluff.  I mean, I enjoy comedies like There's Something About Mary that do virtually nothing for civilization, yet make you laugh out loud, but it's always a great incentive to watch a comedy that keeps its ear to the ground, that's down to earth.  Few times have I watched a film that made me laugh so hard, yet touched my heart in the most poignant fashion.  Mr. Saturday Night is a real gem!I've always been a big Billy Crystal fan, but this is his best work ever!  It's easy for a stand-up comic like Billy Crystal to co-write, direct and act in a movie about a stand-up comic.  But the film also flaunts his range as an artist.  Needless to say, it shows off his more serious side.  I'm sure some elements of the story were inspired by his origins as an up-and-coming stand-up comedian.  And he brings us into all aspects of this fictional comedian's life.  What people tend to overlook is the fact that most comedians...don't live very happy lives.  They may seem very jovial on stage, but what goes on off-stage is an entirely different story.  Buddy Young (Crystal) doesn't have luck with family, friends or anyone in his life.  Sometimes it is his fault, sometimes it's not.  Sometimes the people in his life just fail to understand the real Buddy and his sort of mentality.  I've heard several reviews stating that it's hard to get engaged in a film where the main character is an insulting, unappealing soul.  I personally didn't find his character unappealing at all.  Then again, I don't know Buddy personally.  But I always enjoy watching movies about characters that are hated much more than movies about characters that are loved.  What's compelling about a story about someone who everyone loves?  If you watch a movie about someone who has his flaws, it gives you more to think about.  Why does this person behave this way?  Was there a pivotal moment that caused him to be this way?  But I can respect a man like Buddy Young.  So his jokes are very negative.  They're funny!  Some may not prefer his type of humor; if you don't, that's your prerogative.  All I know is I never seen a comedy that was so consistently funny.  Often when I watch a movie where I get big laughs in the first act, the laughs wear out as the film goes along.  When you make a comedy that starts out really funny, you have to keep that consistency.  The upcoming gags have to be either just as funny or funnier.  Never did I feel the comedy lagged.  There's tons of lines and scenes that will stick in my mind forever.  One absolute gem is a scene in a restaurant.  Billy takes pieces of bread and does all sorts of impressions.  For example, he takes two long pieces of bread, puts them on each side of his head and impersonates a Hasidic Jew.  And later on, he impersonates an interview with a basketball player in the locker room, which is too racy for me to mention.  Here are some memorable linesHey, old lady.  Moses called.  He said you're a great f**k! (to an enormously overweight man)  You look like New Jersey in pants!(pertaining to Jewish food)  These are diseases with prices!David Paymer's Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor was very well-deserved!  He delivers an incredible performance!  Paymer often plays second banana to a group of great actors in the movies that he does, and this is one film where he actually had a significant role, even failing to be upstaged by the great Billy Crystal.  Paymer delivers a powerful, subtle performance in which his facial expressions are much more compelling than the words he speaks.    The chemistry between Crystal and Paymer is excellent.  Though they don't share much of a resemblance, they are extremely believable as lifelong brothers.  I was raised an only child, but I'm sure many siblings can relate to their love-hate relationship.  Crystal is the aggressive type, whereas Paymer is simply there to ride his coattails and criticize him.  Buddy Young is not the perfect individual, but he has a strong personality, whereas his brother Stan secretly envies that strength and constantly fires his insecurities at him.  There is a great scene, where Buddy reveals to his brother that Stan wishes he could've lived the same life, wishes he could've been the one who had the guts to perform on stage, wishes he could've been the one to ask Elaine (his current wife) out that time he hooked the two of them up.  And though Stan doesn't agree with his brother, you know he agrees.  He wishes he was as successful and had the guts to do what he did.  And Buddy was simply doing him a favor by giving him a taste of what it's like to be a celebrity by letting him be his agent for many years. The minor flaw  the overdone makeup job on Crystal in his later years.  I felt the makeup jobs on Paymer and Julie Warner were done just right.  Their aging is more convincing, whereas Crystal looks like Peter Falk in Roommates.  He doesn't look old, he looks like Billy Crystal behind loads of makeup.  But Crystal delivers such a credible performance that it's easy to overlook that minor goof for most of the film.  Watching a film like this makes me feel that I wish there were more comics like Buddy Young nowadays.  In one scene, Buddy watches TV and sees a guy--dressed like a hippi--telling all sorts of mindless jokes about drugs.  He comments, You call these jokes?  Exactly what I'm thinking.  So many modern comedians just don't have that magic that comedians of the yesteryear had.  And they play themselves out, depending too much on subjects involving sex and bodily functions.  Buddy Young is like a cross between Don Rickles and Rodney Dangerfield.  The kind of comedian that makes you laugh hysterically, no matter how many times you see him perform.  Never does he run out of steam, just like Rickles and Dangerfield.  Mr. Saturday Night is like nothing you'll ever see!  It's hard nowadays to find a comedy that's even funny.  This is movie that's not only funny, but it's hilarious.  And it's not only hilarious, but it's touching and powerful.  A must-see!My score  9 (out of 10)       "},{"Title":"Mr. Show Biz!","Date":"2 February 2007","Score":"7 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" This is a great movie! Crystal is deep without being annoying. This movie has a wholeness about it lacking in so many other works. I must admit, I just watched this movie almost 15 years after it's debut because I thought it was Billy doing stand-up. I had no idea the involved story and how deeply touching it would be.Those who were disappointed in this film went into it looking for a comedy the likes of Eddie Murphy or someone else. So did I...but how could the story not change attitudes and opinions? To each their own.I could see how this movie had difficulty finding an audience. It paralleled Crytal's life too much and many like myself like Billy, but maybe not enough to see him do Live stand-up. He never quite held that arena strongly. Also, he was still riding on the 'When Harry Met Sally' steam, which was in large part a chick movie (again, rich with dialogue and opposite of the Stallone action hero us guys seems to like). So, reluctance to see Crystal in his own stand-up movie was not for me.This movie is really a classic and will last the test of time because of the story between two brothers.

Billy plays Buddy Young Jr, a long time comedic veteran who despite numerous close calls, never achieved stardom. He is accompanied through life through his weather beaten but devoted brother Stan, that acts as his manager. Its clear from the beginning that Buddy is self absorbed about himself and making it to the top. The two bicker and banter back and forth as stan wants to retire and Buddy wants to keep going. This is the best part of Mr. Saturday Night. The relationship between the two brothers. David Paymer is very convincing and extremely well cast as Stan. Frankly, when the two are together the movie is at its best but when Buddy is alone with others trying to salvage his career its a definite let down. Not that some of the scenes are not funny in there on right, but the movie needs the two brothers more. I think if they had centered the entire movie on just the two of them this would get a much Higher rating from me. Maybe if the whole movie had centered on the scene at the restaurant with Chrystal and Paymer reminiscing about the past ups and downs and near successes, it would have been more cohesive.

His long-suffering brother (David Paymer) took on the part of his agent who lived in Buddy's shadow and stood by him for all those years, despite having to endure his frequent conceit and abuse.Most of the story centers around Crystal and Paymer in old age makeups, well past their prime but still trying to get Buddy some meaningful gigs. Unfortunately, Buddy is a short-tempered and self-centered egotist who is his own worst enemy. Helen Hunt plays a young newcomer to the agent business who's never heard of Buddy but takes him on to try and find old Bud some worthwhile jobs. Crystal is surprisingly strong in his turn as Young, not always likable but someone you can still feel for. But it's David Paymer as his sensitive brother who really turns in the best performance.

I didn't expect it one bit, not from Crystal. And it works. Then, the acting. I just love these movies, mostly based on the confrontation of two characters. This one has it.

The two could be brother's in real life and if there's one thing I wish is that they both did their act together and fed off one-another. But it's not about 2 Misters.I recently watched the film again, but its been probably 10 years since I last saw it, so it seemed as fresh as the first time. I like the story, drama, intrigue, and I find it really entertaining. There are many funny parts and I do believe people are selling this film short.Thanks "},{"Title":"Very good film, if only the ending was better...","Date":"1 October 2005","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" Finally an 'issues' and a 'character' film. A film that makes you think... Success, failure, career, retirement, family, friends, love, children, life, death, it's all there. Some wonderful characterizations and some great acting (Crystal was excellent but especially Paymer as Stan was an Oscar-worthy performance). The atmosphere in the film is so real you can almost cut it... On the downside, the ending was too Hollywoodian and thus unrealistic, a person like Buddy never changes, no matter how 'politically correct' it is to see him do so in the film. A pity, this downgrades the entire film from excellent to very good. I believe Crystal also 'dedicated' this film in a way to all those artists that for all the reasons in the world, never quite make it. There are thousands of them.

While the film is billed as comedy and it does contain wonderful moments, it is very much tragedy. A tragedy that all entertainers may have to face sometime in their careers You're a hit today, but a nobody tomorrow. Oscar nominee Pauymer is wonderful, as are Warner and Helen Hunt.

I watched it and it was great. Ever since I saw City Slickers I didn't think any Billy Crystal movies would be very funny. This one is funny. Billy Crystal is even a good director. I recommend it to anyone.

"},{"Title":"A wonderful drama about a comedian.","Date":"3 July 2002","Score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  As others have said, this is NOT a comedy; unfortunately, it was marketed as such, which is why it wasn't successful in its theatrical release. It is, however, an excellent drama, with Crystal as a comedian who rises to the top, but who is tragically flawed. The life of Crystal's Buddy Young is a conglomeration of aspects of the lives of particular real-life comedians, including Milton Berle, Sid Caesar and Jackie Mason.I recall having seen this film in the theater and being blown away by David Paymer as Crystal's brother; Paymer later won the Oscar for Supporting Actor. An at-the-time relatively unknown Helen Hunt also does some compelling supporting work in a brief featured role.One major flaw, as another commentator pointed out, is the weak aging-effect makeup in the last part of the movie. You just have to suspend your disbelief and hang in there til the end.

Billy used the old Cocoanut Grove for a number of nightclub scenes. In one scene, it was a Catskills' night club in another scene, a television studio. He also used the kitchen for some other scenes where Billy and David Paymer's character interact.It was interesting that Billy chose the hotel for his nightclub scenes as it was a fixture in old Hollywood for variety acts and much of the social foundation in the old studio days. During the production, he was focused on the history of the place and seemed to enjoy the atmosphere it created for the scenes.He came back to the Hotel to shoot a number of scenes from HBO's *61.

It's an ego trip for Billy Crystal. He doesn't seem to know that it takes more than 10 layers of latex to make a 40 year old actor believable as a 75 year old comic.

It was slower moving than a starfish. I almost expected to see Ed Wood's name in the credits. The worst thing was that Buddy Young's makeup looked like Billy Crystal stuck his face in a vat of hummus. It was so hideous looking I came close to choking on my gummi bears while watching it. I would have had more fun watching a school of fish.  "},{"Title":"Don't Let Me Get Started On That","Date":"20 May 2011","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" Billy Crystal creates an unforgettable masterpiece of a characterization with comedian Buddy Young, a funny man for all ages. Not that he's that funny all the time, but we do see him at all the stages of his long life that now is on the decline. Mr. Saturday Night makes it all viewable by borrowing a technique from Citizen Kane.If Billy is not waking up and smelling the coffee his brother David Paymer is. The brothers were originally a duo, but Paymer decided that performing in front of a live audience just was not for him. In fact it almost wasn't for Buddy Young. But when Jason Marsden put down his first heckler with a great insult comeback, he knew this was the life for he grew up to be Billy Crystal.Paymer became his agent and did that for forty years representing Crystal exclusively. It worked well kind of like Bing Crosby who brought his whole family of brothers and sisters into the business of Bing Crosby. But now Paymer wants to retire and spend time with the grandkids. But Crystal can't see himself doing anything else but performing.Times and public tastes have changed and even though Crystal has put a lot of what used to be called blue material in his act, he still doesn't have the appeal he once had.Mr. Saturday Night should be seen with Marjorie Morningstar because both protagonists start out in the famous Catskill Borscht Belt circuit. Unlike Gene Kelly's character of Noel Airman who can't make that leap into the big time, Crystal's Buddy Young does break into that second tier of comedians who were good in their day, but never achieved first rank. Forty years in the business, Crystal is still looking for that one big break that will make him a comic immortal. Like Jerry Lewis who started in the same circuit and who Crystal meets at the Friar's one day.If Crystal has an epitaph is that while he loved wife Julie Warner and daughter Mary Mara a lot, his true love was the audience. Helen Hunt has a nice role as an agent who genuinely tries to help as does Jerry Orbach who is the head of said agency who Crystal knew way back when.Mr. Saturday Night got one Oscar nomination for David Paymer as best Supporting Actor. The brothers have a curious symbiotic relationship and neither really functions well without the other. Paymer gives a controlled and restrained performance in contrast to Crystal who is always 'on' due to the nature of his character. Paymer just wants at some point to know there is life away from show business.This is a fine film with Crystal really pulling out all comic and dramatic stops to give us Buddy Young. How good is this film, as Buddy Young would say, 'don't let me get started on that'.

I'm sure Billy wants to make us a little uncomfortable, to tell us something about ourselves.  It's just that I find Billy's characters self-absorbed, over-analytical and not very sympathetic, so that when they agonize or suffer I'm more annoyed than touched.  Julie Warner is stunning (as always) in role of Crystal's wife.  6/10   "},{"Title":"garbage","Date":"7 June 2004","Score":"3 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  do not see this movie.  do not see this movie.  within the movie everyone laughs at scenes that are painfully unfunny and you feel sorry for the actors for having to make themselves laugh at such weak weak jokes and then after feeling sorry for them for a while you start to hate them and wonder what motivates people to agree to do garbage like this if it isn't money because it should be money to be in something so corny and tired and schmaltzy schmaltzy schmaltzy the make up's the least of its problems though indeed production values are a small step up from porn film but how could it matter with something so dreadful the movie makes you feel bad for Jerry Lewis for having to be in this I don't generally feel sorry for Jerry Lewis but really felt this was a waste of his time, not to mention every single person except for Billy Crystal who deserves, I guess, to be in such junk if he insists on it.

Through the story of Billy Crystal ascomic - young and terrific, old and miserable, there is a great dealof Jewish cultural life (the Catskills, for example) and Jewishhumor including some Yiddish.  The love story of Billy and Elaineis  a parody on every Jewish Mother's dream that her daughtermarry a doctor, and Billy's brother plays into that when he tells herparents that he is a pediatrician.  The love-hate relationshipbetween the brothers is universal, and beautifully portrayed.  JerryOrbach and Ron Silver, in small parts, add a lot to the film. I believe that Billy Crystal is one of the great talents on stage today. He was great as the MC of the Oscars.  This is comedy combinedwith realistic drama and although one writer complains about theaging makeup, I think it's great, even the slumped shoulders. Iwatched it on Saturday morning over breakfast and it takes a lot toimpress me during that time period.  I give it an 8. "}]
