Love, life's tragedies, children, and home are all themes. There is a light-heartiness to the film, and it plays on the contemporary character's life as it unfolds.

Such criticism issues from the fact that this film is about the lives of ordinary people, with Robin Williams playing a succession of classic Everyman characters.  As such, most people won't find it entertaining enough, particularly if they're of the gimme-gimme-now post-MTV generations.  This film tells stories about small people, not notable ones, and the emotions which they feel.*Being Human* is a slow and philosophical story--as the title suggests, it's a story about what it is to be human.  Love, loss, slavery, hopelessness, faithfulness, lust, hope--all these themes are touched upon as the story moves throughout the ages, presenting us with various Everyman characters all played by Robin Williams in what are surely his best dramatic performances.This film is much like *My Dinner with Andre*--a truly meaningful and important film which isn't meant to appeal to everyone, just a more intellectual crowd.  Its unfortunate spate of negative reviews comes from the fact that, unlike *My Dinner with Andre*, it was targeted for broader public consumption with a fairly large theatrical release, and to this day plays on premium cable channels to audiences who want to be watching fast-paced blockbusters rather than introspections into our humanity.If you can appreciate a film with a slower and more deliberate pace and real insights into humanity, watch *Being Human*.  It's a masterpiece.

Here Hector (Robin Williams) and a woman story teller (Theresa Russel) whom we never see but only hear, weave several stories for Hector's children to explain his absence from their lives for several years. Each story attempts to explain figuratively what emotions he went through during the period.An attentive viewer is amply rewarded by director Bill Forsyth--if you are a casual viewer you will wonder what is happening and consider the film to be disjointed and hence poor entertainment.Non-linear narratives are not Forsyth's invention--such films have adorned French and Hungarian cinema for decades. Being Human is above average in that company merely because of fine performances from Williams, the beautiful Anna Galiena (Beatrice) an Italian actress, Hector Elizondo, John Turturro, William Macy, and Ewan McGregor to mention a few.While the imaginative storytelling technique was impressive, Forsyth never explains who the lady narrator is. Are we expected to imagine it to be Hector's new love? The gradual jumps in time scales, gives us a socio-historical perspective into Hector's education in life, seen through the eyes of his children. Forsyth is interesting but not the best director using this technique. His film demands attention, both literally and figuratively.I understand that the director disowns the film after the studios forced him to truncate the film by 40 minutes. Probably the director's cut is far superior to the present version and is likely to be more satisfying to a discerning viewer.

You will repeat your lessons again and again in various forms until you have learned them. After learning it, there's evolution and wisdom. This is what can be said about this film except that it presents its stories without having this sort of spiritual value. It brings this idea of the eternal returning throughout this main character but it is developed almost like a fairy tale taken out of a children's book.Travelling through different countries and periods of time, going from the Celts cavemen to the modern New York businessman, Being Human has Robin Williams playing a character named Hector and his appearances in distinct centuries trying to learn what means to be an human being. In the five short stories created here, Hector, living as an Celtic in the highlands, had his wife and children taken away by barbarians; was the slave of a dumb master (John Turturro) in a more civilized era; an married man who fell in love with an foreign woman, a few centuries later; a military during the Portugual's Maritime Expansion on Africa, conquering new lands and new treasures; and as troubled divorced man trying to reconciliate with his children of whom he hasn't seen since the end of his marriage. The movie fails in being real or accurate enough in all of the stories except in the last one which is very close to us.Slow, of mannered delivery and hardly getting better as the stories unfold, Being Human is the kind of film that really follows its lessons, it'll only grow on you after countless views. In my case four attempts, of these in two I fell asleep (but always believing that there was something interesting there), one in which I watched the whole thing and didn't like and the last one in which my perception changed and end up being a good film, far from being a masterpiece that it could be. So, you'll have to watch this film over and over until you get something from it, then you can evolve into really saying if this is a good or a bad film. This whole idea of a man trapped in strange and quite horrendous situations where every kind of decision ruin his life but always running to something else thinking it'll be better and lead him to a good life, was brilliantly presented in a book called The Star Rover by Jack London. In it, the main character is a prisoner that can recall his past lives as a way of escaping from his current pain of being tortured. But in those lives things don't get any better and he's always getting into more and more trouble. Being Human falls as an pretentious art film with symbolisms that never work and stories that are difficult to be involved with. Luckily, they have Williams as a main actor and we root for him whatever the Hector he's playing. We care for Hector in all of his situations because there's something there that is involving enough to make us imagining what kind of decisions we would make if we were him. In at least, one of the stories you'll put yourself into Hector's shoes. Won't blame director/writer Bill Forsyth for the flaws presented here since this is not his original project, Warner Bros. forced him to cut the film and include an narration that is quite excessive and too much explanatory. The narration (provided by Theresa Russell) of a film destined to grown up's treats its audience as children, explaining many things we're seeing on the screen. It ruined some parts of the film. Result poor criticism, an box-office failure and now who knows this film? I sincerely hope that one day Forsyth come out of the shadows and show to the world this film in its integrity in a director's cut DVD (even the known version is hard to find). The things that attracted me into Being Human are the quality of the performances, not only Williams but also Turturro, Lorraine Bracco, Hector Elizondo, Jonathan Hyde, Anna Galiena, William H. Macy among others; the beautiful cinematography; Michael Gibbs fantastic musical score (specially the music presented when the movie enters into the 20th Century, an highly agitated theme). The story, at times, knows how to hold our interest but only for those who have an open mind to accept the concept of a man living over and over a similar life that bears only difference of costumes and periods of time. Hector's conditions and the way love acts in his life are quite the same, yet he fails to learn something from these experiences. Very problematic but not enough to make you feel bad about it, Being Human comes as a good film about valuable and noble lessons that sometimes crosses our paths in this long journey of life. 7/10 "}{"Title":"They're Celts","Date":"16 August 1999","Score":"9 out of 14 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  The first scene, sometimes referred to as cavemen, Goths or Vikings in reviews seems more accurately to be ancient Celts.

Without more information (they are a fairly laconic lot) I would assume they are probably a rival tribe of fellow Gaelic-speaking Celts of Scotland or Ireland.  This was a welcome tidbit at the beginning of the film and probably added to my enjoyment.I appreciated the attempt to portray the ordinariness of life throughout the ages and I view the slowness of the film in this light.

I had just gotten home from work and in stone cold sobriety managed to see myself in turn so exquisitely entrapped in the same quandaries as Hector that specifically at the moment of the simple act of his being given a pair of boots during the African shipwreck vignette, I had to run outside into the cool starry night. The top of my head seemed to explode and my self spontaneously shifted levels and merged with the consciousness of the universe. I unaccountably became a bodhisattva for some months (i. e. you could say I flipped my lid.) My co-workers were terrified of me when I returned to work, but my family and most everyone else I knew marveled at the change and soon grew to approve of it.

It was at this point that I thought the story was going to revolve around Hector and his children so it`s a shock to the system when later on in the movie the action switches to a shipwreck in the 16th century which again features Williams character .

All I knew was that it was composed of five separate stories that spanned centuries, with Robin Williams as the link between all of them. Sounds quite ambitious, right? Yes, but the end result was underwhelming and, dare I say it, a little dull. There are, however, some major themes explored here as indicated by the title. I guess if you were to boil the film down to its essence, it is, simply put, about being human. Being more specific, it is about mankind's search and need for companionship and family, along with all of the other small things, good and bad, which enter into our lives on our journey through time. Robin Williams' character Hector, a name which he has for the entire film, can be said to literally make a journey through time. It's not explicitly stated, but since he does keep the same name throughout, you could say that his character in each subsequent story is a reincarnation of who he is in the previous one. This is all fine, but there were some spots which felt underdeveloped and worst of all, the film is practically destroyed by some of the worst voice-over narration I've ever heard. Thankfully, by the final segment the narration isn't so omnipresent. By far the worst effect of the narration is to replace character development and spoon-feed the film's themes to the audience. I did a little research online, and apparently the director, Bill Forsyth, had to cut 40 minutes and add the narration after an initial cut had a poor test screening. It's a pity that that early version isn't available to watch, because I think the film would be better in that form. The closest I think the film got was the final segment, but that one segment didn't exactly make up for all that came before it. But it did tie the film together thematically, and provide a satisfying conclusion to the larger story arc. Overall it was a satisfactory watch, but it still felt like it was missing something. Better films like this would be CLOUD ATLAS and THE FOUNTAIN, but there are still elements to appreciate in this film.

The best I can come up with is the above equation, but I don't really think that was his goal in this ill-advised attempt at a serious film about the subject.First, the narrators, far from provoking interest in the upcoming material, bore us to death with pretentious generalizations and leading questions until we no longer care much what's coming as long as it means they'll soon shut up for a while as the next vignette is dramatized.Second, Robin's recurring male character, Hector, presents us with a rather doubtful example of humanity, since he is out of step with the rest of his peers. How can Hector be a valid example when there are so many humans that contradict his character? Far from being an everyman, he is a marginal example at best. He never seems to aspire to anything higher than his own selfish desires. He takes advantage of people with nobler aspirations, and then wonders why they disparage him as a loser and a fool. If being human means being largely clueless about virtues, I guess that shows something, but I'm not buying it. Using a recurring male character as the focus of humanity seems also to be rather sexist, doesn't it?Then there's the whole question of whether reincarnation is implied..... Unfortunately, nothing in this film is consistent enough to say one way or the other. If Hector is being reincarnated, he's going to be at it for a long time, since he's not learning anything from one cycle to the next. He hates being a slave, but then becomes the same type of foolish master that he himself had in a previous incarnation. I think it's best to just not consider this question further, since either way this film proves nothing about being human either way.Bottom line, if Hector is being human, then count me out of humanity, PLEASE!

Because of the changes that the studio insisted upon it inhabits some kind of strange middle ground.

This is not so. If the character William's is portraying is human, then we might as well call ourselves droids. His stiff way of acting and terrible forms of expression harm the respect one holds for him as an actor. Sure the script is bad and it should have stayed as a book or whatever, but whoever wasted their money to produce this tape of diaster was simply not aware of exactally how bad this movie is. And yes, if you analyze it to death I'm sure you can find parallels and connections to human responses to different situations, but for the regular people who just want to enjoy a movie, don't bother with this one. Nothing to enjoy. And if you happen to notice that Ewan McGregor's in it, yeah, definatly not worth sitting through to catch his evil glare and two one liners. I'd rather see a role where he actually gets to use his talent. This movie sucked. I'm sorry to rest of you who thought is was under rated, but honestly, I think you're just a Robin Williams fan justifying a bad choice.

Robin Willams takes the serious side of life and portrays it well. The most memorable part is during the pre-historic scene. His expression and utter helplessness when his family is taken away is something I will never forget.

Well lets start with saying that this was the most outrageously boring film in the entire world. I would rather eat popcorn staring at the wall at home. Robin Williams is my favorite actor, but this is my least favorite movie. It started so peaceful, the trailer was nice, the cover was interesting, but the movie was like walking through thick goo, it takes you ages to get through, and you are not comfortable. Now what a movie ay? If you want a story, read a book. There was not much music, practically no good effects or camera moves. Costumes were alright, the dialogue was good but tedious, and plus, no real excitement through the whole thing. Lets just say, it is a bit different hmm? The story is meaningfu but i would understand it more on a book. While you watch it, you don't concentrate on the movie but the things around you. You start counting your teeth, or the tiles on the floor. You bite your nails and do whatever you do when bored (e.g. eat). It is truly a movie for your home with a hot meal and while its raining. But, watch it anyway, it may be appealing to you, but no matter what happens, prepare for a sleepy adventure!!!!!

Very ambitious and unusual, and Robin Williams' performance is pretty solid, but it just doesn't work. Worth watching if you're looking for something really off the beaten path. If you watch carefully, you can catch a glimpse of Ewan McGregor in his first ever movie role, as one of the crusaders.

However, the story - a wild, rambling yarn about one man through the ages (or something) is just awful.Worth a look but well done if you make it to the end. &#5; "},{"Title":"I ACTUALLY WALKED OUT","Date":"28 November 2004","Score":"2 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" I Love Robin Williams. The Guy is simply Amazing. So when I took my girlfriend to see this Movie in the theater I thought we would both be in for a treat. Instead... we watched a train wreck. Both of us kept looking at each other in disappointment as we started to fall asleep. About 50 Minutes into it we actually walked out. We had to. We Both wanted to! This thing just wasn't getting any better. I have never walked out of a movie in my entire life..... until this movie came on the screen. The Movie Being Human is truly Horrible. However I do recommend that you Rent it just so that you can see how horrible it is for yourself. I highly recommend it for people who have trouble falling asleep. When pills won't work..... This movie will.

Being Human may possibly be the worst movie I have ever seen. The concept is dangerous, edgy, over the top- a modern man's family struggle is paralleled by other struggles throughout the history of man in order to suggest that there is one story that sort of gets played over and over again, just in different ways.  However, this movie falls short in execution; way short.  In fact, other than that it has sort of an intriguing concept, it plain stinks.  And that's not an exaggeration.  Anyone that can sit through this two-hour bomb without passing the time by making fun of it either thinks too much or doesn't think at all.  It makes me wonder if this is one of those stories that they came up with by putting 100 monkeys at 100 typewriters and seeing what they got.  I think that's how they made West Side Story too, but don't quote me on that.My rating  Stinky    "},{"Title":"Good idea","Date":"5 June 1999","Score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  The story is pretty original and could have gone a long way, but all the effort went into making the plot add up and not making an original movie, it's all rather closed and doesn't really say anything.
