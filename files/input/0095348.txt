The jokes come one after another after another and very few of them miss the mark. It is pure mindless fun from start to finish. Additionally, many old stars of the genre are here, though I might have enjoyed seeing a few more of them.One word of warning though if you are a die-hard, bleeding-heart, politically correct individual, this movie MIGHT give you a heart attack! We showed this movie to such a friend and we eventually had to turn off the video because she was having heart palpitations! But, for everyone else, this is a hilarious film. Also, it may help to try watching a couple Blaxploitation films FIRST to help you understand the parody better. FYI--Because of the language and brief nudity, this is not a film for the kids. My advice to parents is to watch the film secretly and then feign shock when your kids ask to see it! When the kids are at least teens, then it's probably okay to let them know the truth--that this is a great little comedy.

Will these vigilantes be enough to end the crime spree of Mister Big?A flat out funny film from Keenan Ivory Wayans. Not only did this film jump start all of these older actors careers, but it was popular enough to warrant a series pilot (a t.v. remake of this film called Slade, Hammer and Slammer) and it helped the Wayans create another show for Fox called In Living Color.

I believe that it is the best of the parody genre, I've ever seen. I stoically believe in my critique because I've seen every movie that Sucka parodied. I grew up watching blaxploitation films. They were being cranked out at blinding speed at that time, and the highlight of my circle of friends, was planning our Friday nights around the premieres and plotting which superfine guy with the biggest Afro would take us out. I was in junior high school and life was good. Fast-forward 15 years to 1988 (I saw this film for the first time in the year of its release), where my memories were jumpstarted and slapped into a frenzy of flashbacks. Recalling particular scenes of movies that at the tender age of 14 I had taken seriously, and now saw how funny and ridiculous they were. For example the demonic PMS scene was reminiscent of Abby,our version of The Exorcist, or Kung Fu Joe spoofing Three The Hard Way. Wayans spoofery of those films along with the then-timely use of 'truck jewelry' as an inciting incident in this film was much too much for me to take. I laughed till I had to take a puff from my inhaler (and I don't even have asthma!)I'm sure this film will seem funny to those who never experienced the blaxploitation scene from its inception. But for those who did, you will laugh yo'ass off, you jive-turkey,you! P.S.A recent viewing of this film gave me the idea to have what we call '70's parties. We now dress up twice a year with all the Afro wigs, white lipstick, and crocheted mini's we can find. We have a blast and quote some of the worst dialogue ever written.

Starts right off in Any Ghetto U.S.A. where a young black man has died of O.G. (overabundance of gold chains). His brother Jack (Keenan Ivory Wayans) comes home from the army to find the people who hooked his brother on gold. With a couple of older black men (all from the 1970s films) they decide to clean up the town.Now it sounds pretty stupid--but it actually works. There are some real bad jokes but the good ones outnumber those vastly. The whole cast plays it straight with plenty of small roles or cameos from veteran 1970s actors. You don't have to know the old films to enjoy this but it does help a few times. It's really good to see Antonio Fargas back in a film making fun of his 1970s image. John Vernoon (Dean Wormer from Animal House) is also lots of fun as Mr. Big. And Ja'net DuBois is hysterical as Jack's overprotective mother. And--since this is directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans--most of his family shows up in small roles. Sure it's silly and stupid but also very funny. Turn off your brain and enjoy! By far the best thing the Wayans have ever done.

The first full length film directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans, 'Sucka' is the classic set-piece of a returning war veteran avenging the death of his brother by taking on the mob and with his group of hardened 70's crime fighters, reclaim the streets from Mr. Big.The film itself is competent enough though a little thin on visual jokes and slapstick preferring longer skits which more often than not fizzle out simply because they run on for too long. For a first-time helmer this is understandable as you go with what you know, and as Wayans was more comfortable with stand-up and TV 'Sucka' wasn't able to develop into a coherently funny movie the way 'Scary Movie' would be some 12 years later.What makes it stand up is the sheer lunacy of some of the set-pieces, and the cast which would make any blaxploitation picture salute with pride. Alongside Wayans you have blaxploitation legends Bernie Casey spoofing Shaft, Isaac Hayes and Jim Brown reprising their roles as 'Truck Turner' and 'Slaughter' and some deliciously funny cameos from Clarence Williams III, John Vernon Antonio Fargas and a young Chris Rock. The picture though belongs to the late and sorely-missed Steve James in a delirious send-up of his own career as martial-arts sidekick. Despite being a better actor than most of his co-stars James would forever languish on the B-list and would die just five years after this movie was made. He steals every scene he's in though, and if you need to bow out to 'Kung Fu Fighting' it's as good as any a way to go.The film has a few good running jokes such as the mother's stunt double and the Shaft score running in the background and at a trim 88 minutes doesn't stay too long to put you off it. In the end it succeeds despite being nothing more than a loose collection of sketches held together by some very funny and very talented actors. It's worth watching just for the exchange between Hayes and Rock where the latter tries to buy some food (note watch the end credits of Rocks' CB4 and you'll see this repeated at a newsstand) and the Pimp of the Year sequence, complete with Fargas wandering into the ghetto in full 70's pimp outfit mistakenly believing he's the smoothest thing out there. It's easy enough to like this film rent it, enjoy it and hope someone comes up with a sequel soon.

Keenan, despite an impressive physique, is amiable, sweet, and rather innocuous but he so wants to be a tough guy. Problem is his mom (Ja'net DuBois) keeps coming to his rescue! Even the likes of Antonio Fargas (his pimp show and pimp walk are prime funny bits) and Steve James (his martial arts expertise gets a send up by Wayans; I was disappointed he didn't get the chance to show you how much of a badass he is instead of his high energy Bruce Lee imitation played to the level of Kung Pow; he does kick some ass but it is in a lampooning fashion) show up in supporting bits. I wish Wayans had given Clu Gulagher more to do, and Vernon as Mr. Big is mentioned a lot more than seen. It is hard for me not to feel like they were a missed opportunity. Kadeem Haridison and Damon Wayans as two thugs working for Mr. Big are two of the worst street criminals imaginable. One of my favorite scenes has Anne-Marie Johnson appearing in a bar as a sexpot only to reveal (as pieces of her sexy are pulled off) that she's not exactly the babe she first led Keenan to believe. Brown and Hayes are so much fun together (Brown has foot trouble, with his bunion towards the end quite a hideous sight, while Hayes loads up with so much ammunition at one point that when he falls all the weapons go off incapacitating him!), while Casey's lectures and mentoring on Keenan's manning up only add value to Bernie's being involved in the movie. This isn't always laugh-out loud funny as it wants to be, and the mark is missed on occasion, but the movie's heart is in the right place. Clarence Williams III makes an appearance as a Black Panther whose clout as a political leader has diminished (his talk of his protesters hired by the government, and how his very white kids speak of Abe Lincoln while his white wife in beaded cornrows holds her fist out, shouting, Fight the Power! admittedly had me in stitches) with Wayans so disappointed. Dawnn Lewis is Wayan's love interest, and when she gets cramps it as if she were Linda Blair from The Exorcist! The film ultimately is about Keenan's rite of passage and how his brothers-in-arms help to get him there. The in-jokes and breaking of the fourth wall moments are right out of the Abrahams/Zucker school of comedy.

All of those combinations make I'm Gonna Git You Sucka a Cult Classic and Keenen Ivory Wayans at his best.I'm Gonna Git You Sucka tells the story of Jack Spade(Keenen Ivory Wayans,(who also wrote and directed)a soldier who has just returned home from the Army and finds out that his brother Junbug has been killed and crime in his hometown is being ran by local crime lord Mr. Big(John Vernon). Tired of the crime and violence,Jack asks for the help of John Slade,(Bernie Casey),a crime fighter from the 1970s to help take down Mr. Big and laughs and chaos ensue.I'm Gonna Git You Sucka is one of the all time great Comedy classics that is funny and hilarious from beginning to end and is one of the best Spoofs and Parodies that ranks alongside Airplane and The Naked Gun Trilogy and is a Comedy that is underrated. I'm Gonna Git You Sucka is a movie that perfectly makes fun of the Blaxploitation movies of the 1970s films such as Shaft,Superfly,Coffy,Foxy Brown and Dolemite just to name a few. Like some of the best Spoofs and Parodies IGGYS takes all of the trademarks and style of those films and turns them on their head with rapid fire humor showing the silliness and craziness of Blaxploitation movies and Writer-Director Keenen Ivory Wayans pulls out all the stops making fun of the genre while paying homage to the genre taking hilarious shots at Action heroes,criminals and Blaxploitation stereotypes of the 1970s. The Comedy and laughs in IGGYS is laugh out loud hilarious and you will have tears rolling down your eyes because with every scene because there are gags and moments that are over the top and unpredictable to the point you never know what will happen next. The Comedy is also imaginative and creative and done with an energy and style that is nonstop and raunchy and the movie never loses it's demented edge until the very end.(Instead of dealing with drug use like the Blaxploitation films IGGYS deals with Gold chains,OG or Over Goldan overdose of too many Gold chains making fun of the way Hip-Hip artists and criminals who were wearing lots of Gold chains in the 1980s)The Comedy in IGGYS can not only be seen as an introduction to the Wayans family but also a precursor to Keenen Ivory Wayans terrific sketch Comedy series In Living Color and the Wayans family's other funny and amazing Spoofs Don't Be A Menace and Scary Movie. Jack Spade and the other main characters are so outrageous and over the top it makes the characters and situations in the film wilder and funnier it's almost like looking at a cartoon that is more insane than the Blaxploitation movies the film's making fun of. With each main character no ones head is on straight and when things happen to the characters you as a viewer are along for the ride. The screenplay by Keenen Ivory Wayans is fantastic and memorable with lines and scenes that are wild and unforgettable. Although a Spoof of Blaxploitation films,IGGYS has fun appearances from 1970s Film and Television icons such as Bernie Casey,Issac Hayes,Jim Brown,Antonio Fargus,Clarence Williams III,Eve Plumb(Jan of The Brady Bunch)and Janet DuBois who are all have fun with their characters sometimes playing it straight but not taking the performances too seriously. I would have loved to seen Fred Williamson,Pam Grier,Ron O'Neal and Rudy Ray Moore in the movie as well. Although IGGYS is a Comedy,there is also a few well done Action scenes which are exciting and explosive but at the same time add to the Surreal and outlandish tone of the movie. The ending of I'm Gonna Git You Sucka is amazing,funny,Action packed and is a wonderful conclusion to this classic film.The cast is wonderful. Keenen Ivory Wayans is excellent and hilarious as Jack Spade,with Wayans bringing laughs and energy to the role. Bernie Casey is brilliant and funny as John Slade and has great scenes with Wayans. Antonio Fargas is terrific and cool as Flyguy,a pimp. Steve James is wonderful as Kung-Fu Joe,a Kung-Fu master that helps Jack and John. Issac Hayes and Jim Brown are great and funny as Hammer and Slammer,a crime fighting duo. Ja'net DuBois is outstanding as Belle,Jack's loving but overprotective Mother. Dawnn Lewis is terrific and beautiful as Cheryl,Jack's love interest. John Vernon is delightful as Mr. Big,a local crime lord. Damon Wayans and Kadeem Hardison are a fantastic laugh riot as Leonard and Willie,Mr Big's henchmen. Also,lookout for fun cameos from Clarence Williams III(Kalinga),Eve Plumb(Kalinga's wife),Chris Rock(Rib Joint Customer),Kim Wayans(Nightclub singer),Shawn and Marlon Wayans(Pedestrians),David Alan Grier(Newsman),Clu Gulager(LT.Baker),Anne-Marie Johnson(Cherry),Robin Harris(Bartender At Sam's,John Whitherspoon(Reverand)Hawthorne James(One Eyed Sam),Gary Owens(Pimp Of The Year Pageant Announcer)and Tony Cox(Wayne Evans).The direction by Keenen Ivory Wayans is wonderful,with Wayans moving the camera and bringing a wild energy to the film. Great direction,Wayans.The score by David Michael Frank is fantastic,intense,memorable and matches the film nicely. Fine score,Frank. There is also a great soundtrack with songs by The Gap Band(I'm Gonna Git You Sucka,You're So Cute),KRS-ONE(Jack Of Spades),Curtis Mayfield & Fishbone(He's A Flyguy),The Four Tops And Aretha Franklin(If Ever A Love There Was),Issac Hayes(Theme From Shaft),Jackson 5(Dancing Machine),Edwin Starr(War),Carl Douglas(Kung-Fu Fighting),Too Nice(Two Can Play The Game),Jennifer Holliday(Magic Man),Friends Of Distinction(Grazin' In The Grass)and more.

Jack declares war on Mr. Big, powerful local crimelord. His army is led by John Slade, his childhood idol who used to fight bad guys in the 70s......Its a spoof of the blaxploitation genre of the seventies, and has the added bonus of most of the stars from the genre, and the makers obviously love the material that they are lampooning.But time has tainted this movie. Seeing through the eyes of an 11 year when first released, it was a fun movie, gigantic toes, woman taking body parts off, and a white man controlling the ghetto, it was genius.Now watching it, I look at Wayans, and think that he's the on responsible for the slew of really poor spoofs that have hit our screen screen since Scary Movie back in 2000, and there have been too many.Don't get me wrong, there are a few good moments, but it doesn't hold up now like it did back then, and it feels really old, just like the jokes.But kudos to the makers for making this, and getting the most important people from the genre involved, save for around tree and Grier.Way past its sell by date.

Throw in Jim Brown and Isaac Hayes, and we have a serious homage and love letter to the 1970s (perhaps even more so than Hebrew Hammer, although they are distinct enough to be hard to compare).I have not been a big fan of the Wayans brothers. Some of their films are great (this is one of them, as is Don't Be a Menace) while others (White Chicks) probably should never have been spawned.

Blaxploitation films are hilarious by nature. Low budget, bad acting, and a bunch of people who think they know martial arts. If you're not a person that has watched your grandpa, grandma, mother, and father watch hours upon hours of blaxploitation films of course it would appear hard to spoof. Blaxploitation is far more than just Pam Grier and Richard Roundtree. Bernie Casey, Jim Brown, and Isacc Hayes have been in more blaxploitation films than you could shake a stick at. they lend their knowledge to the cast of characters and puts the true flavor of blaxploitation films on the screen for you to see.This movie does an excellent job of capturing the essence of what made blaxploitation films funny and uses it to I'm Gonna Git You Sucka's advantage. Comedic timing and popular characters inhabit this movie from beginning to end. If this movie isn't funny then you don't know funny. You especially don't know black urban humor funny.

The official cause of death has been determined as O.G. - over gold, of chains, bling in general - but Keenen's convinced that the local mob, led by the aptly titled Mr Big (Vernon) is responsible. He enlists the aid of a number of former 'black heroes' to challenge Mr Big and his cronies.With a cast lifted from the very films it satirises (Casey, Hayes, Brown, Fargas), Keenen has managed to incorporate sage humour with colourful slapstick comedy. The highlights are too frequent to list, but the scene in which a young Chris Rock tries to buy an order of ribs is as good as they come. It's rare that most (if not perhaps all) of the jokes succeed in a parody, by Keenen has achieved a resounding success in that regard. Cleverly, there's no esoteric references to the blaxploitation films that might confuse the viewer; basic references are well sign-posted, so anyone can enjoy the satire.Aside from the leads, the entire supporting cast excels, although veteran character actor Clu Gulager's role appears more prominently in the film's early stages, than he's subsequently featured. Kadeem Hardison and Damon Wayans (one of many of the Wayans brothers appearing) are an hilarious couple of Mr Big's goons, while the late Steve James (recognisable from the American Ninja franchise) is a deft piece of characterisation, as a chop-socky homage named 'Kung-Fu Joe'. A smirk or wry smile here and there attests to the fact that the cast appear to be having a lot of enjoyment with their zany characterisations.The praise is endless and so are the laughs. Sets and props often look TV quality, but the catchy music, sharp dialogue and sensational cast more than compensate. A top shelf parody without pretense.

June Bug died of a horrible OG (aka Over Gold), selling everything he had and selling his soul to contract more and more gold jewelry! The movie just gets crazier and crazier...funnier and funnier as it goes on. He falls in love with his brothers widowed wife, enlists Jack Slade and Fly Guy (Former Pimp of the Year) to team up in an effort to over throw Mr. Big.

Some of these films today are laughable at best, which makes Wayans's film all the more funny.Wayans plays Jack Spade, a soldier boy who returns home after his brother dies due to OG (Over Gold, his body covered from head to foot in gold chains, rings, etc.). His mother (Ja'net DuBois)and Cheryl, his brother's widow (Dawnn Lewis)are being threatened by Mr. Big, the crime boss (Richard Vernon). Realizing that he can't fight his battle alone (Even though his mother is tough enough to help him), Jack recruits John Slade (Bernie Casey),Hammer (Issac Hayes),Slammer (Jim Brown) and Kung Fu Joe (Steve James) to bring down Mr. Big once and for all.This film is in the vein of Airplane! and The Naked Gun films. There are a lot of visual jokes (At the police station, there is a 10 Most Ugly poster), and a lot of inside jokes (When asked about who the identity of the incredibly bad singer, they're told that she's The Director's sister.).Favorite scenes 1) The Rib Joint Customer A customer is so cheap that he wants to by a single rib and have a sip of soda (Pour it in my hand for a dime, he says). It's a delight to watch a young Chris Rock in one of his earlier roles.2) Spade and Cherry Cherry looks like a sure thing, and very sexy to boot. However, Cherry is far from perfect.3) Flyguy When Flyguy (Antonio Fargas)gets out of jail, he is wearing the clothes he came in with.

On that note, it misses the point of what it means to spoof a particular genre -- if you can't get actors who actually were in those genres, what's the point of even making a parody? "},{"Title":"One of the worst movies I have ever seen...","Date":"19 May 2001","Score":"1 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy","Review":"  I'm Gonna Git You Sucka 1/2*I'm Gonna Git You Sucka is a spoof. Spoofing can be either easy or very hard. The writer Keenan Ivory Wayans took on a hard genre to spoof blaxplotation movies. Movies like Shaft. I think the movie would have worked better as a satire than a spoof.When Jack Spade (Wayans) comes home to discover that his brother has OG'ed, Over Golded on Jewelry, (insert expected laugh) he vows revenge on Mr. Big, who is played by a gray, heavy, old man (insert another expected laugh). That's pretty much for the plot. There is no real reason for this movie to exist. Also in the movie is Isaac Hayes and Bernie Casey spoofing themselves. Packed with puns and guns, this movie fails on just about every level. Here are some calculations I made during the movie.Times I Laughed 0Times I Sighed in Annoyance Estimated 17 times.Times I felt bored 1 hour and 28 minutes (see running time)So, as you can see, I thought this sad excuse for a movie was horribly unfunny, stupefying, boring, and just plain bad. There's a few long running jokes in the movie that weren't funny to begin with that are stupid. The theme song for the movie is horrible. I've seen better acting on Barney and Friends. This plot is an thin as paper. Keenan Ivory Wayans isn't funny. The use of the f word gets annoying. It fails every chance it gets. In short I hated I'm Gonna Git You Sucka. "}]
