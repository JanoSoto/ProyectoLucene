[{"Title":"The Taboo of Human Contact","Date":"2 April 2001","Score":"68 out of 85 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  'Exotica' is clearly Egoyan's best film and his most successful presentation of the motifs that have characterized his films throughout his career; these include the presentation of the narrative out of chronological order, the interaction of characters by means of videotape and hidden surveillance, the relationship between parent and child, and the repetition of situation and dialogue.  The film's theme involves the superficial barriers-both physical and psychological-that prevent people from making a genuine emotional connection with others; as we watch the film we witness how various people react to these barriers and struggle to break them down. The film's strong emphasis on structure and focus on Thomas' and Francis' parallel 'hunts' for human contact can't help but remind of that masterpiece of medieval literature 'Sir Gawain and the Green Knight' (this is a work that Egoyan was born to adapt to the screen). In my opinion each of the film's six major characters parallels another to compile three pairs.  The first pair of characters is composed of Thomas and Zoe.  The most obvious similarity between these two is that each owns one of the film's two principle locations.  Thomas' pet store and Zoë's strip-club are comparable in that both are businesses whose principle merchandise is living creatures that are excessively displayed so as to persuade the customer to make a purchase.  Moreover, while the pet store is lined with glass cages and fish-tanks, the walls of the strip-club are composed of two-way mirrors through which employees can secretly observe the customers. In addition to the life that each openly sells, both also possess hidden life.  We see this in Zoë by the fact that she is very pregnant, but must disguise her appearance so as not to remind customers of the possible consequences of the lecherous behavior that her club encourages. Likewise, in the film's first scenes we see that Thomas is pregnant in a different way.  Here, he is smuggling exotic bird eggs into the country by strapping the eggs to his stomach in order to hide them from Canadian customs officials.  This hidden life also extends to their introverted personalities.  To combat their inability to communicate verbally, both try to make interpersonal connections by means of physical contact.  In a sense, then, Thomas and Zoë (as the Greek origin of her name might suggest) are givers of life both openly in their businesses and privately in their interaction with others. Next, Francis and Eric are parallel characters because of their mutual obsessions with Christina.  Although Christina is intended to be seen as a sex object, neither Francis nor Eric has any interest in her in this regard. Instead, she symbolizes an emotional relationship that both once had, but now have lost.  When they eventually discover their real relationship, Francis and Eric find that they do not need Christina and make an emotional bond with each other, which is symbolized by a physical embrace. Lastly, Christina and Tracey can be associated because Francis considers both as symbols of his dead daughter.  However, Francis' relationships with Christina and Tracey both fail because he is unable to develop bonds that go beyond their assigned roles as a stripper and babysitter.  Therefore, while Zoë and Thomas can be seen as givers of life, Christina and Tracey clearly receive life by taking on the roles that Francis and Eric impose on them. There are also many reoccuring images and symbols that reinforce the emotional isolation of the characters.  The use of secret surveillance by two-way mirrors serves both as an invisible yet uncrossable boundary between people who would otherwise be very close to one another and as a way for the characters to make private judgments of those who are being unwittingly observed.  In fact, while Eric secretly observes and judges Francis during his nights at Exotica, Francis, because of this job as an auditor, does the same to Thomas during the day.  Egoyan reminds us that this relationship can ultimately be extended to include the audience members, who also make private judgments of the film's characters (we've this before in films like Hitchcock's 'Rear Window' and Powell's 'Peeping Tom').  As we watch the film, we too are in a sense reaching out to forge an emotional connection that transcends the barrier of the medium itself. The film's overriding presence of money suggests to the characters that the only legitimate grounds for a relationship is financial, and any time an emotional connection is made the characters feel guilty if they are not paying for it. Finally, the frequent appearance of parrots and their uncharacteristic silence reflects the characters' inability to communicate and overcome the losses of their past.  I've really grown to admire this film and Egoyan's work in general.  In 'Exotica' he creates a work of complex symmetry and interconnecting symbols while also conveying an atmosphere of lyrical intensity.

I nearly didn't watch it because the video cover advertized it as an erotic thriller and the image on the front is of Mia Kirchner doing her strip-tease bit. Granted, Exotica centers around a gentleman's club of the same name, but to call this film a simple erotic thriller is to miss out on a lot, on too much.Exotica follows four seemingly unrelated storylines a man sitting alone at a table in a strip club, another man smuggling exotic parrot eggs into the country (Exotica takes place in and around Toronto), two apparent strangers walking in a field of green, and a young girl who plays a flute in an empty house.  Egoyan begins with these vastly different puzzle pieces then slowly, inexorably brings them together.Atom Egoyan is one heck of a masterful director. He is the epicenter of this cinematic symphony that leads carefully from movement to movement until the finale bursts forth in equal measure of catharsis, discovery, and tragedy. Plot to him is like tapestry weaving. He threads narrative, characters, time, and setting in such complicated iterations that one is at once nearly overwhelmed by the intricacy and awed at his skill, a testament to his brilliance as well as his belief that a film-going audience is actually intelligent.At it's heart, Exotica is a tragedy of circumstances. Or better yet, a collision of tragedies of circumstances.  Indeed, the film isn't so much about tragedy as it is about those who survive tragedy and the toll a single event can exact for the rest of the lives of those who survive.  Exotica, the gentleman's club, serves merely as a focal point where all these individual tragedies radiate to.Equally haunting in all this is the music. Mychael Danna's score  sets the film's tone dark, exotic, deceptively simple but savvier than it lets on. Also worthy of note is the music in the club itself, a blend of American house funk and Middle Eastern tones, warbled in Arabic.I highly recommend this film. Ignore the naked women who sashay from time to time in front of the screen (difficult as that may be at times) in the scenes shot in the club. The really interesting stuff occurs at the margins of the film, as the gulf separating the storylines begin to vanish, and the final scene gives you the keystone to a horrifying clear vision of a sadness so overwhelming that no one in the film escapes unscathed.

This, like Egoyan's follow-up masterpiece The Sweet Hereafter is an intricate, elliptical, and tragic look at grief and loss focusing on the people who work at and patronize a Toronto strip club.  It's all very literary and symbolic (the exotic creatures of the pet shop being audited by Bruce Greenwood's tax man with a sad secret mirroring the exotic dancers of the club where he finds his solace after hours) and surprisingly emotional (especially at the end).  Character development, secrets, and inner truths are revealed slowly and carefully and in non-linear fashion by Egoyan's delicate director's hand.  The exotic flavored yet haunting musical score is an added bonus.  Worth a look if you are in the right mood and know what to expect from Egoyan.

First time I saw it (about a year ago), I wasn't really sure what to make of it, but there were scenes from it (when Elias Koteas reveals why his connection to the disturbed and grieving father and the scene with the father and his daughter's babysitter at the end) that have always stuck in my mind. A very haunting and beautiful movie (even though it gives a very unpleasant view of life), with a haunting snake charm style score and starring the brilliant Elias Koteas (from Crash) and the lovely Mia Kirshner (from early first season 24 and The Crow City Of Angels). Victor Garber (Sidney's dad in Alias) also has a couple of scenes. Not to many tastes but very rewarding if you can appreciate it (although it's sense of detachment probably puts off a lot of people).It seems to me to explore the theme of people trying to connect, in a very insular and ultimately unfulfilling way (the young gay man who goes to the ballet every night and gives away his extra ticket for companionship or the grieving father who pays a young girl to babysit his empty house so that he can have the illusion his daughter is still around for example), and also the theme of loss (variously of loved ones, innocence, youth, opportunity etc). The Exotica strip club seems such hollow place but at the same time it seems almost understandable that it would draw hapless souls night after night with nowhere else to go. Some of the dialogue seems poetic, cynical and truthful all at the same time. A film that you really need to watch to the end before you really feel you understand it's puzzle (and even then there seems to be something just out of grasp this viewing). A moving portrait of life that will linger in your mind afterwards.  "},{"Title":"Help For the Viewer?","Date":"30 August 2004","Score":"25 out of 28 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  CAUTION-SPOILERS AHEAD-EXOTICA has been overwhelmingly praised by the critics.  I think the Tomatometer is at 95% favorable.  Here is my take on EXOTICA-maybe it will help some viewers to appreciate this fine film.The film is very much a paradox, sensual but sterile, intense but distant, hollow but haunting.  It is a complex story with a relatively simple theme.  The characters include Francis (Bruce Greenwood) as a Canadian government revenue auditor who is auditing the financials of an exotic pet store (whose owner Thomas is played by Don McKeller) while trying to exorcise his demons at a strip club called EXOTICA.  During his nocturnal visits to the club he pays his niece Tracey (played by  Sarah Polley) to baby-sit his seemingly absent  daughter.   The viewer gets to know the strip club DJ, Eric (Elias Koteas); a stripper, Christina (Mia Kirshner) who dances for Francis and happens to be Eric's ex-girlfriend; and the very pregnant (by Eric) club owner Zoe (Arsinee Khanjian) who is having an affair with Christina.The plot is an example of elliptical storytelling in that it moves in a purposeful ever-circling way to slowly reveal the connections between the worlds of each character.  There is enough misdirection to keep the viewer wary of their perceptions.  They must pay complete attention and remember what they see.There are significant technical reasons to like this film.  It is first and foremost a director's film and Adam Egoyan's directing is amazing.  A director is responsible for both casting and for directing their cast.  For Exotica Egoyan added to his cast of regulars two of the best young actresses (Kirshner and Polley) in Canada.   Kirshner's performance provides an extremely unusual combination of sensuality and thinly masked pain.  Polley is simply the most subtly expressive actress in film today.   They are world class talents who seem to deliberately stay away from mainstream films but have little trouble getting lots of work.  Greenwood, McKellar, Koteas, and Khanjian, are likewise excellent.   Egoyan kept all six reined-in so that their performances are low-key and restrained.  While there were many stylish and beautiful camera shots he mostly keeps the characters at a distance.   Exotic décor, busy sets, atmosphere, restrained acting, minimal tight shots, and frequent plot misdirection keeps the viewer from bonding or strongly identifying with the characters.  He did not want the viewer getting into the heads of the characters, he wanted us to internalize the theme and to take it into our heads.  This way if we pay attention we will learn as much about ourselves as we will about the characters.The theme is substitution, how the process of living is simply a process of substitution.   We grow out of things and find substitutes for them.  We lose something precious but we carry on by finding a substitute.  We expand our horizons and find substitutes that we did not know about or that we thought unattainable.  We need something we can't have so we find something that works as a substitute. Sometimes the substitutes are an improvement on the original, sometimes they are a better match with a new stage of life, sometimes they are an imperfect substitute but the best that we can manage, and sometimes (certainly in this film) they are an addictive trap that keep us from moving on or growing.Most people's dreams don't come true and they settle for a substitute, often without really noticing.  The most compelling scene in `Field of Dreams' is when Burt Lancaster is talking about what it was like to give up his dream of playing major league baseball.  He says  `It was like coming this close to your dream and then watching it brush past you like a stranger in a crowd.  At the time I didn't think much about it.  We just don't recognize the most significant moments in our lives when they happen.  Back then I thought there will be other days, I didn't realize that was the only day'.   While his character accepted the end of his dream and substituted a life as the town doctor, in Exotica the substitutes are dysfunctional because there is no acceptance.  That is why so many of the substitutions involve payment, a transactional substitution is a temporary event and allows the illusion to stay alive.  Exotica focuses on the substitutes used by its central characters.  Francis substitutes Christina for his daughter and Tracey for Christina (when she was his daughter's babysitter).   Eric substitutes his club DJ job for the career he wanted in radio, he substitutes his voyeurism in the club for his inability to have a lasting relationship.  Zoe substitutes for her dead mother and continues to run the club, instead of a husband she has Eric contractually substitute so that she can have a baby.  Thomas substitutes his opera liaisons for a real relationship and substitutes an incubator for the eggs he has taken from a nest.  Christina substitutes a protective Francis for her uncaring and probably abusive father.  Voyeurism substitutes for interaction.Eric's voyeurism eventually leads him to the conclusion that the Francis-Christina mutual dependency has gone from a temporary coping mechanism to an addictive trap.  He elects to destroy that relationship by convincing Francis to touch Christina.  Eric knows that the relationship must end once this occurs, no matter how Christina reacts.  Either she will no longer be able to use Francis because he betrayed her trust or Francis will no longer be able to use her because he can no longer maintain his illusion of protecting her purity.  Then they will both have to move on and seek new and hopefully more positive substitutes. Contrary to some who have commented on this film I did not see any real `plot holes'.  Almost every detail is eventually explained and if anything Egoyan made the plot a little too predictable.  But at least this was balanced by some interesting misdirection-like having Tracey live above a shabby strip mall so you jump to the conclusion that she is a child prostitute and that Francis has a thing for young girls.  Certainly on the second viewing it is clear that many clues are provided and that the outcome is being subtly telegraphed throughout the film in a kind of mental striptease.As already mentioned, the really unique feature of this movie is that the viewer does not really connect with the characters but instead connects with the substitution theme.  The audience is given a new perspective from which to think about their own substitutions.  Perceptive members of the audience are forced to be more than observers.  This is powerful stuff.

Egoyan's technique is to fracture a story like a jigsaw puzzle, giving the viewer bits and pieces which only all connect in the final scene.  That ripping apart of reality is especially appropriate here, since the movie is about people putting their lives together after terrible trauma.  It's also about the danger in leaping to conclusions -  the viewer is often tempted to make a judgement about what he or she sees, and that judgement is often both wrong and unfair.  If this all sounds like homework, be assured that the movie is also a lot of fun it's sexy and interesting and inspired.

This was an unusual film in that I was not sure whether I was enjoying it or not, but equally could not have switched it off. It was only when I found myself thinking about the film some days later that I realised what an excellent piece of cinema I had witnessed. Through IMDb I checked for other work by this director & came across The Sweet Hereafter. I quickly obtained a copy, and whilst watching it became spellbound by its slow burning intensity and the excellent performances of Bruce Greenwood, Ian Holm & the wonderful Sarah Polley.I needed to see more, and bought a copy of Exotica. This film is an absolute masterpiece. Again, like Sweet Hereafter it has a slow burning quality,accentuated by the repetitive nature of the lives of the main characters. Excellent performances from Bruce Greenwood, probably one of the most underrated & understated actors of his generation, Sarah Polley, Elias Koteas and the beautiful Mia Kirshner. As you watch this film, you wonder how the lives of these characters will eventually impact on each other, and your mind searches for possible explanations. When this explanation arrives, it hits you like a tidal wave, washing away any doubts that you may have had about the quality of Egoyans storytelling.After gorging myself on a surfeit of summer blockbusters, which although enjoyable at the time, like a Chinese meal, leave you empty again some few hours later, I needed nourishment for my mind as well as my eyes. The discovery of the genius of Atom Egoyan has provided this spiritual feeding.

Then, as the filmed performance of that life performance unfurls, we have amble opportunity for layer shifting and ambiguities... lots of things that amplify power like the notion of an actor who is acting that they are acting, or better not acting, just staying.We have here one of the tightest films I've ever encountered. The stance of the acting, the braiding and mirroring in the story, the score and the camera eye are completely congruent. So completely congruent that I have placed it as a 4 of 4, which is more than just a good film. In my system, it denotes required viewing, sort of an equivalent of Bloom's list of great books without which one cannot invent intelligence.The trip is rugged, demanding but rewarding.We have a young woman acting as a schoolgirl and providing succor to a wounded gent. We have her former lover, damaged and bitter at his frustrations, `directing' her. Both work for someone who hides addiction under the blanket of tradition. The wounded gent is incapable of performance (even `touching') so acts as codependent, demanding recipient of performances.This is the stuff of life that anyone experiences. Here, it is framed within a certain kind of stage.Within this, we have watchers, auditors, voyeurs, monitors, toilet interlocutors, two-way mirrors. We also have pregnancy, eggs, children... and death. The bearer of eggs (soon to be lost to love) and the wounded gent are thrown together, and thus begins the braid. The end of the braid puts us at the point where one performance cannot continue, but the other must go on. Is it reality that continues?Ted's evaluation 4 of 4 -- Every visually literate person should experience this.

Set in and around an exotic, otherworldly nightclub in Toronto aptly called Exotica, the film calmly unravels the loaded emotional baggage of each principal character. Although Egoyan likens the film's non-linear structure to that of a striptease, it is, in my humble view, much more of a puzzle, or perhaps a jigsaw with strategically placed missing pieces. The end might yield answers for some but the film still asks many questions that arise from the character's perverse dealings with various relationships and situations that many would consider 'strange' to say the least.For most of its duration Exotica presents a primary mystery (a child's murder) as a puzzle to be solved, then has one of the main characters, Francis, explain the mystery towards the end; but the questions remain &#150; do we trust that explanation? Are things that simple? Did Egoyan really want the end to tie up the knots tightly and leave no ambiguity? I still find the film deeply ambiguous and disturbing.I think as a viewer, Egoyan wants us to focus on two characters more than others &#150; Eric and Francis. Both are linked by a tragedy and a sense of redemption but Francis is a far more enigmatic character, someone who substitutes his daughter's murder for quasi erotic pleasure at Exotica. Egoyan only hints at why Francis continues to substitute his dead daughter with the erotic dancer Christina at Exotica. The supposedly sexual element of their relationship is not resolved at all. This clouds the murder mystery which the film supposedly resolves via Francis's disclosure.Exotica, I feel, wants us to read deeper meanings in what is presented, but ultimately, the compulsion to read between the lines is what it invites the viewer to do, however, final or revealing, the end might be.

I originally watched the film late at night on a channel called 'Showcase' which doesn't edit their movies. I'd heard of the director, Atom Egoyan, but hadn't seen any of his films. After the credits began to roll, I sat there absorbing its impact. This is a film where all the secrets and the characters motivations are not revealed until the end not a bad thing. The film creates an atmosphere of sadness and melancholy that is spellbinding and the plot itself is a compelling one.The film is almost 'Magnolia' in a strip club. I say that because it is about several characters whose lives are so interconnected they will inevitably meet. If one person were removed, their lives might just collapse. One of the characters, played by Bruce Greenwood has a destiny that will, in fact. meet up with one of the club's young dancers and the DJ, something we do not expect. We make assumptions about characters, whether they or good or bad. I don't know how many times I was wrong. The film twists so deviously yet so quietly and deliberately. We don't know anyone's full story until the end, which reveals something so heartbreaking, it almost tears the fabric of the movie.Of note is the movie's cinematography and music. Some of the music is eroticised, creating the atmosphere of the strip club. But others, like a haunting piece that plays over the 'field scene' are breathtaking. That piece of music has to be one of the most effective and beautiful piece of music I have ever heard. Whoever did it  I believe it was Michael Danner or something has to be commended for creating a piece I will always remember. The cinematography is just as effective. It is darkly filmed, with some graininess but vaguely rich. The field scene has a yellow tinge to it It feels almost heavenly. From what is revealed later, it is anything but heavenly......An amazing film that must be seen by thinking moviegoers. From the way it was advertised and the video box art, it looks like some voyeuristic porno. It is anything but. After seeing Egoyan's other films, like 'Felicia's Journey' and 'The Sweet Hereafter', it must be concluded that this is his most accomplished film.

It makes you THINK, forces you to go scene by scene in a way that is utterly spellbinding.  The nudity is a little shocking at first but dealing with its subject matter, for the 'art', so to speak, it's understandable.  One of the best films of 1994, without a doubt.The way that Egoyan intermingles different symbols, cuts back and forth through time, uses repeated imagery, and, at some points, holds back with severely limited dialogue, paints films that capture what it's like to live and remember and be alive.  We watch the film, not knowing throughout the whole thing at least 80% of what the hell is going on during the scene, because we understand that the film is a kind of puzzle that'll be pieced together with time.  That sense of unknowing- not knowing everything about the characters, not knowing everything, just yet, of what's happening- makes Egoyan's films, and certainly Exotica, some of the most mentally stimulately movies in cinematic history.All in all Egoyan should of won Best Director in 1997, not Cameron, and this film definately deserved a best screenplay nod in 1994.  I'll leave you with a potent piece of dialouge from the film, via Bruce Greedwood and Sarah Polley-Tracey- do you ever get the feeling that you didn't ask to be here on earth?What?I mean- no one ASKED that we be brought here.

Have you ever left a movie and wondered what happened to the characters later?  The next day you are still trying to play it out in your imagination, did they turn right or left?  Did they live happily ever after?  Or not.  Who cares anyway? is the feeling I have about this movie.  I watched the first half of the movie on the 4th of July.  The fireworks interrupted my viewing.  On the 5th of July, I was filled with antisipation.  So many senerios, so many deeper meanings.  What happened?The ending was disappointing.  It left me feeling cheated (but not in a good way).  Some movies fool you into believing one truth but showing the truth to be the Big Lie.  Deep.  True.  This movie turned out to be a stupid lie. Not deep.  Not true.  Just a lie.Loose threads?  What is mysterious about loose threads that have fogotten how to sew?  You might ask How can a thread forget how to sew?  For that matter, how can a thread even know how to forget anything?  A thread doesn't even have a brain!  But I'm sure this clever directer thought he could imagine a way to fool naive audiences into beleiving that even a snowball has a chance in hell. No, it doesn't.If that doesn't make sence to you, get used to it.  Niether does this movie. All threads are left loose, without rhyme or reason.  This is not a movie to contemplate the various endings that might have taken place.  There are no might've, could've, would've or should've  moments in this movie because, quite frankly, you know by the end of the movie that random bits of seemingly meaningless information were not so seemingly after all.

As I watched this movie, I hoped my cousin, who's daughter really was murdered, doesn't accidentally see this movie.  The notion of a grieving father watching a re-inactment of an innocent little girl played by his own daughter's ex-babysitter is nauseating.  The fact that we weren't even given a reason for the depravity is even more disenchanting and far-fetched.  Oh yeah.  She wasn't praised as a child and he wants to fill that need.

Also added into the mix is Thomas, (Don McKellar) an exotic animal store owner who becomes involved when Francis is performing an audit on his books and discovers transgressions there, essentially blackmailing him into helping him get to Christina.Even if I were to provide enough information about the film without concern about spoilers, it would be hard to describe the plot of the film. Exotica, while centering on a strip club, is mostly about relationships, (all unhealthy to very great extents) and the evolution of one's character and personality. The film is told in a non-linear style, which is usually very refreshing, but I found that while I was willing to endure the very slow pacing for a great denouement, particularly because I felt like I was being set up for one, I didn't get one. These problems with the film are in direct contrast with the beautiful and stylish cinematography and the fairly rich character development. Things as subtle as Victor Garber's (who played Greenwood's brother in a small but important role) Black Power t-shirts were, upon reflection, a great touch. And the performances of the main players were decent, though I will admit that I got a little tired of Mia Kirshner after awhile.Unfortunately, the negatives and positives of Exotica offset one another, and therefore left me pretty tepid. It can be recommended to anyone who likes independent cinema, but beyond that, I can't imagine it being tolerated by a mainstream audience. Perhaps it deserves a second viewing, to appreciate it further, but I give it a 5/10.--Shelly "},{"Title":"Stylish and dream-like, a story that gradually reveals itself","Date":"31 January 2016","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":" I like Exotica for its relaxed atmosphere and pacing. It isn't jumping around trying to be about something or knock you out with unexpected twists. The characters and style draw you in. The strip club Exotica is special. It seems vaguely artistic rather than sordid. It has palm trees and plants, smoke that suggests water vapour - it's a bit like a tropical rainforest. And then a young woman dressed as a schoolgirl comes out, starts dancing, miming actions to the words of a Leonard Cohen song (which also adds a lot to the mood), taking her clothes off absent-mindedly. She seems to be in her own world, not specifically dancing for an audience. It's entrancing especially because of the way it's filmed. And as the DJ Eric (Elias Koteas) says, there's something mysteriously appealing about the innocence of a schoolgirl combined with an erotic dance (by an adult woman).Her main client is Francis (Bruce Greenwood) who seems solely interested in her and perhaps for something more or other than just sexual entertainment. She fulfills a psychological niche for him. Maybe it's her eyes, her personality, her patience to listen to him. Well, we find out much more as the movie progresses. All of the characters are somewhat intertwined. It's pretty creative when you think back afterwards. It isn't simply cute, it's not a gimmick or a device to make you think the film is clever. The film could reveal everything from the start and still work similarly. But it's a nice touch to slowly let us find out about the connections.The characters are flawed but in ways that make them endearing rather than annoying. Francis has a calm demeanour which seems to hide inner feelings of regret or sadness. We learn he has been affected by a loss. When police investigate a crime, secrets come out. We see this happen in countless movies and TV shows. But there rarely seems to be any concern for the ways in which these secrets may hurt people. It's funny that major things may be revealed but nobody blinks an eye or apologises because it's all towards the greater cause of solving the crime (usually a murder). In any case, Francis had to endure several unpleasant things. He actually seems to have coped with the ordeal well - he doesn't appear overly bitter. But it's the ever-present reality of his permanent loss that he can't overcome.There is a side-plot which seems less necessary and interesting but I guess its oddness still makes it interesting to watch. And in the end, it still connects back to the main story and maintains the overall mood of the movie. It involves Thomas who smuggles eggs and goes to the ballet with strangers who know something about him.I like the way we learn more and more about the characters and they all seem so human. Confused at times, uncomfortable with each-other, saying things half-way between wise and meaningless, spying on each-other, needing things from each-other. There's a nice motif of people watching others through half mirrors (or listening on a recording device). We believe other people have what we need, they have the secrets to fix our life, to satisfy us.This is a movie I need to see again at some stage to properly appreciate. It is satisfying that the plot doesn't really leave holes. Well, there might be motivational gaps in between what we know but we can ponder how and why things happened by ourselves. I guess it's all about understanding and appreciating the characters and this is the kind of movie that rewards your trust and investing your time.

By the end, with the use of some key flash-backs, it has offered several clues without explaining very much explicitly. But from these we are able to better understand why certain characters act the way they do and are in the position in life they are. It's certainly a fairly intriguing film overall that will reward those who can take the distancing effect of its overly stylised form of acting. It's labelled in some places as an erotic drama but it has to be said that for a film centred on a strip club it's really a very unerotic film.

As the film unfolds, and the cast's relationship to the central event grows in clarity, some moment of revelation is achieved. Virtually all of Egoyan's films adopt this narrative structure, which seems to blend a modernist search for truth with a decidedly postmodern admittance that truth requires the careful sorting of both vantage points and testimonials.The traumatic event in this case is an accident involving a school bus. The bus skids off a road and veers onto a frozen lake. The ice breaks, the bus sinks and 14 children die. Of course, everyone in the town then suffers the knock-on effect of this accident.Man, you might say, is a creature constantly in search of meaning (the brain itself is a pattern recognition machine). He creates myths, patterns and rhymes, trying desperately to assert some measure of order. He cannot accept the chaotic cruelty of the universe, preferring instead to create comfortable rituals and routines in the hope of insulating himself from pain.When the unexpected does occur, man lifts his head and cries Why?. But God never answers. Into this vacuum steps Ian Holm, who in The Sweet Hereafter plays a lawyer trying desperately to assign meaning to the film's central bus crash. He wants the parents of the dead children to band together and file a law suit. A law suit against who? The guilty bus driver? Nope, the driver is broke. He wants to go after the company that made the bus. He wants to sue them for millions. It is their fault. Alone.At first Ian Holm comes across as a greedy pig. Here is a man milking suffering for money. But gradually we learn that he is himself a man intimately familiar with loss. His life has been one of misery, and the film is peppered with flashbacks detailing his relationship with his daughter, a drug addict who is dying of AIDS. Like the parents whom he hopes to represent, this lawyer is looking for the meaning of his own suffering. Why me? he cries. Lashing out against others and assigning blame is the only way he can rationalise things.Similarly, the small town in which the accident occurs seems at first to be a picturesque postcard village. But gradually this image is shattered, as promiscuity, infidelity, alcoholism and sexual abuse all raise their heads. Director Atom Egoyan, an outspoken fan of The Shining, even uses the famous Horse and Train picture from Kubrick's film, a recognition that both films deal subliminally with the same buried, almost invisible horrors.On top of all this, Egoyan adds a layer of myth. He has one of the film's children narrate Robert Browning's The Pied Piper of Hamelin. In a self referential moment, the child asks Who took the children? Who was the piper? Why did the fabled portal in the mountain (the breaking ice) open up and swallow the kids?In this way, Egoyan approaches his central the tragedy from at least 3 angles. Firstly, as a fateful moment of chance, secondly, as a mythical act of God (God smites the parent's for their sins) and thirdly as an event exploited by a vengeful pilgrim of pain. All three approaches seek to lay blame, targeting either the failures of parents, the actions of a punishing god or the laws of a wholly arbitrary cosmos.The Sweet Hereafter is a very hopeless film, man never able to grasp absolute clarity (which of my behaviours, if any, caused this?). But there's also something very hopeful about Egoyan's ending. The sweet hereafter of the title is that zone of wisdom (found by the child who narrates the Piped Piper) where we ultimately come to accept the unacceptable and go on living.Similar in structure, Egoyan's Exotica approaches the same themes from a different angle. A man (Francis) loses his wife and daughter in a car crash. To cope with the pain he hires a young girl to come over to his house every day and babysit the daughter he lost. This babysitter simply plays a piano and lurks about his empty house, after which the bereaved father drives her home and pays her for babysitting nothingness. This ritual helps Francis assuage his pain. Every night Francis also visits a strip-club called Exotica. There he watches a young woman (Christina), dressed in a schoolgirl's outfit, strip. But their relationship is an odd one. They seem to have a strange history. When she dances for him, it has nothing to do with sex and more to do with longing and loss. Of course both Francis and the stripper have a secret which is incrementally revealed, the truth peeled back like a stripper's clothes, leading to that revelatory final payoff that is typical of Egoyan's work. I won't spoil that moment. Suffice to say that this movie takes us into fairly interesting places. For Egoyan, man seems to live a life of cyclical substitution (we grow or are pushed out of everything and are forced to find substitutes). It's a bleak film, but unlike the work of Sam Mendes, to whom Egoyan is often wrongly compared, Egoyan eschews easy sensationalism and carnival freak-shows. 8.5/10 - Worth two viewings.

"},{"Title":"Barriers Between Humans","Date":"17 October 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":" Egoyan's 'Exotica' is about emotionally isolated people who try to connect with each other. With every interaction between the characters there are symbolic barriers either in the form of finance, two way mirrors and social rules. But once this barrier is seized (symbolically) in the form of physical contact like the touch between Thomas and Chrissy and between Frances and Eric they form a connection. Egoyan does not resolve the 'problems' by showing the characters healed but instead what he demonstrates is that this human connection has brought change within them.In contrast, we also see how the characters once connected but now have drifted apart like Frances and Kristina or Zoe and Eric or Thomas and the officer. Explaining it more would be giving away too much of the story. While we see all these characters struggle to connect, there is Zoe who tries to keep things together but she too is sitting behind a one-way mirror. Egoyan uses plenty of symbolism and simple storytelling just isn't his style. He uses a rather suggestive approach. What he does in 'Exotica' is reveal very slowly.Moving at a slow pace, the film does 'test' the viewer's patience but there are a lot of subtle things happening and one has to observe closely to see that things aren't what they seem on the surface. There's a film-noire type quality to it. A lot of darkness is used, both symbolically and actually. The dialogues are simple but profound in depth. The haunting soundtrack gives the film a seductive and sensual edge.The performances are superb all the way. This is the first time I see Bruce Greenwood turn in a decent performance. Elias Koteas and Don McKellar are first rate. A very young Sarah Polley shows what potential she has. Arsinée Khanjian is terrific. Mia Kirschner blends excellently blends sensuality, pain, fragility and kindness into Chrissy.'Exotica' is not everyone's kind of film. Some may find its theme too dark and too intense but it's a film that isn't afraid to reveal, suggest and challenge the viewer.

The other main character of the story is Thomas Pinto (Don McKellar), a latently gay pet shop owner being audited by Francis.The film is largely about replacements and rituals. Eric used to be Christina's lover and relives the relationship through MCing suggestive fantasies of her. The club used to be owned by Zoe's mother and she is taking her mother's place since it's easier than creating her own options. Francis has his niece (Sarah Polley) babysit while he's gone, even though there's no baby to sit and pays her $20 a night and pays Christina $5 a dance. Thomas goes to the opera on a regular basis and scalps tickets in order to meet up with other men. The film doesn't truly come together until the conclusion where everything makes sense.This film features some great performances, especially Bruce Greenwood as the troubled and intense Francis. Elias Koteas is equally good as the jealous DJ. This is a sorely underrated film with the essentials of a masterpiece. The score is also excellent and I highly recommend the soundtrack as well.Overall, one of my all-time favorite films. A must-see.

Writer/director Atom Egoyan does well to get us hooked on his central characters, without knowing why they are behaving as they do. The plot centres around strip club Exotica as Egoyan teases out his tale like a striptease, little by little showing us more of who these people are and why.The resolution is perhaps disappointing (like a striptease when all has been revealed), failing to fulfill our high hopes. Best character is Francis, who appears to change before our eyes as the film progresses. It is not really he who changes however, but our perception of him. Likewise we view all the players differently in the end, though some of their motivations are hastily explained, if at all.Fantastic performances wrap up this oft times mesmerising film, with Bruce Greenwood a particular standout as Francis. Mia Kirshner (Christina) and Don McKellar (Thomas) are strong too. Also stars Elias Koteas as Eric and Arsinee Khanjian as Zoe.The exotic score is from Mychael Danna, and Paul Sarossy's camera captures Linda del Rosario and Richard Paris' production design (eye catching at times) well.Monday, November 3, 1997 - Hoyts Croydon Cinema "},{"Title":"Almost to deep if there is such a thing-great movie.","Date":"15 July 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":" SPOILERSIt was almost inevitable I'd get around to watching Exotica. I have heard nothing but outstanding things about the film for some time now and it's been on my radar as a film to check out. Although I had heard great things about it I did not know much about the plot. My thoughts after seeing it are many.First of all, the movie is fantastic. Yet I didn't think so at first. I will freely admit that it starts slowly and a certain amount of patience is required when viewing it. If it had been almost any other film I might have given up myself and turned it off but I had heard so many great things from critics, friends, IMDb reviewers and such, I felt almost required to sit through it. So I did. The plot unfolded in a way that is certainly unconventional and the story, which was mildly interesting becomes gripping.Even though I listed spoilers I don't want to say to much about the plot. I will comment that it was almost impossible for me to understand the whole film to the end and even now there are some things I am unclear on. Some might call the end a twist but it is more like an unraveling.I am sure many people have seen a movie they found so intelligent but also so complex, that even at the end, there were things that they were unclear on. That is how I feel about Exotica. This film certainly deserved the incredible reviews it received. I found the characters to be believable, the acting to be exceptional and as Oscar Worthy as anything I've seen lately, and the writing to be basically remarkable. There is such a human sadness to the story that it is not easy to shake it off after the film is over. This is a must see for indie purists, film buffs in general and for people who like movies about life, emotion, and the human soul. It is an unconventional movie with a biting sadness through the whole film that is palpable.Negatives? Not to many. If this movie is viewed by someone who hates slow moving films or hates movies that don't explain everything right away this might not be for them. I will freely admit I am a fan of the above mentioned type of films (SOMETIMES) and I like many indie films but even I had problems with Exotica and were it not for the outstanding things I have heard about it I may have written it off. (IMDB reviews had a little hand in that). In addition I don't think one should be in a strongly sad state of mind when they view this. This film isn't just dark, it's VERY VERY VERY VERY DARK and puts some other pictures I think of as dark, to shame. So one should make sure they are in the right mood when watching this as gloom permeates throughout and it can be a little tough to take.I would firmly recommend this film. Many have described this film as brilliant which I thought was a little excessive but even as I thought that, I couldn't quite convince myself. My ultimate rating is 8 out of 10. One of the best I've seen lately with some of the best acting I've seen in years.

BRUCE GREENWOOD leads a cast that has talent in a movie that has everyone having a motive for being there. Greenwood plays a man who is trying to forget the death of his daughter, ELIAS KOTEAS plays a disco jockey with a rocky relationship with a confused dancer played by MIA KIRSHNER and we have another character who is a gay guy trying to go straight. This is one of the few canadian export movies that reach the UNITED STATES in a era dominated by LETHAL WEAPON sequels that take up 3-4 screens at a multiplex and deliver no quality. This film is a thought provoking explorationn of what makes these people tick. of interest is the Greenwood character in a convincing role as a tormented dad who reaches out to this trade to fill a gap in his soul and one dancer in particular. There is little nudity in this film about a strip club. The film stresses emotional nudity that leads to a person clothing themselves in the skin trade as a reality crutch. I would classify this as an art film. I wish I could write like this but being a hack I cannot. yet, in the prose and the films delivery there is quality not smut. A gritty real world tale.

It's not a Hollywood formula movie that tells you everything you need to know about each person in the first twenty minutes.  Life is not like that.  It takes time to get to know people.  To even get to know oneself why we do things and react to things in certain ways.  That's why formula movies are always bad.  No one can be explained in a short span of time without seeming totally contrived and unreal! I've only seen this film once, which is definitely not enough.  Why?  Because in watching this film I, like every person who sees this film, made assumptions about each of the characters.  I decided which characters were good or bad based on bits and pieces of information that in any formula movie would technically be all that we'd be expected to need to know. But the film gradually digs deeper and reveals the methods to the madness that is surely running each character's lives.  It is a puzzle that doesn't allow us to really see the picture until the last piece is in.  The film doesn't ask us to like or relate to the characters themselves, but to basically look at the workings of our minds and souls.  How illusions shape our lives, how we are each voyeurs who look only at the surface, thus understanding nothing.  The central story of a man who obsessively watches an exotic dancer illustrates this perfectly.  As voyeurs ourselves who only look at the surface, we see him as a voyeur.  He simply seems to be a man who's sole purpose is to look at a pretty girl.  By the end of the film, we see what he sees and how he sees.  He isn't a voyeur at all, there is something far deeper that I would not dare to give away.Some have said that even though they admire the film, they found it an unpleasant experience.  That's because when the film finally reveals itself one is in a sense forced to spiral back in their own minds and think about each character anew.  And since each character and each situation and interaction is so finely laced together, it is almost mind boggling!  Which, as I said, is why a film like this requires multiple viewings.  But if you're interested in how our minds work and how our inner wounds effect us and shape us, you'll find no other film experience that is more whole and satisfying!

It makes me think of time being wasted as we relive over and over again moments in our life which serve to shape and give form to the whole.I believe this film concerns the lengths we go to to retain our grip on our own version of reality; one which we can make sense of and thus live by. The characters consistently collude with one another to maintain their own palpable version of fact which is ultimately destroying them as well as maintaining them. Ergo other characters go to great lengths to maintain this feeling of status quo when it is clear that it is causing the disintegration of various lives. For example, the pet shop owner lives out his own version of the truth when attending the ballet for his own means (after being given the first incentive), but he is unable to voice real truth. Christina and Francis feed off each other to maintain the fantasy in which their encounters ultimately lie. Indeed, nothing is what it seems, but I would reiterate that this film simply reinforces the lengths one will go to to avoid facing the harsh reality of a situation and how readily others will collude to maintain that image ,if it also suits their purpose. Nothing good can ever come of this.

Centred around a Toronto Strip Club which is visited regularly by Accountant Francis who is investigating the accounts of Thomas, a pet shop owner & smuggler. Francis object of desire is Christina who acts as a school girl when entertaining her clients. The Strip Joint is also compared by Eric, Christina's ex-girlfriend, These twisting narratives are brought together at the end & make for compelling viewing. Indeed one of th strengths of this film is how the narratives are clearly defined, the film doesnt leave the audience confused at any point, especially amazing when you consider the relatively short running time of the film.The visual imagery of Exotica is also impressive. The Strip Club is filled with Plastic & painted plants & the cheap, tacky decorations shows the cheap, false relationship between the client & the dancer where nothing lasts & just makes up for that which the client can not get. The dark sets also helps the film, indeed Exotica is extremely un-erotic, as the atmosphere of the film is sleazy & fake. Indeed although billed as erotic drama, it's exploration of human feeling and human need as well as control may lead many to feel that the film has been wrongly advertised.Indeed one of the films most interesting points is the idea of destiny, who has control over our fate, in one scene between Zoe ( the owner of the Strip Club) & Christina talk about why Zoe took control of the club after her mother died. Zoe says It was part of me Indeed this feeling that we do have no contriol over our lives runs through the film. Also the idea of need runs through the film, although the club offers false need for most, for the main characters the club offers the real need which their condtion's need.The film also deals with the idea of being looked at, voyerisum. The start shows a customs official looking through a one way mirror at Thomas as he enters the country, later at the strip club the idea of looking is once again entertained, especially when the one way mirrors of the club are revealed to the audience through which Eric watches Christina.In the whole Exotica is a stunning film, and is highly recommended. I'm sure some who will enjoy the film have been put off (while some who didnt have been put on) the film by the idea that it is a erotic drama, but this film is much deeper than this & is an intelligent & interesting movie.

There is no moral resolution, there is only life.  Rotten and stuck in a maze the characters deal with their loss but never stop living.  It's not so heart-warming...just true.

This film is a sifted image of lives. Each becoming thicker the more the viewers are shown.Nothing is finalized 1) Francis, the tax inspector, may be allowed back into his nightclub of choice, suspectfully he may not as he was outside the club the night after his meeting with the manageress, 2) Thomas, the gay exotic-pet shop owner, may escape the threatened years in prison, suspectfully he may as he helped Francis who offered to turn a blind eye, 3) Christina, the university graduate lap dancer, may escape the warm and involved world that has grown around her at work as a lap dancer and find a respectable, well-paid & promoting profession as befits her intelligence, hopefully she will as she has the education and appears stable yet not as content in her job as ideal, 4) Eric, the caught up in the past, DJ and MC, with an unsatisfactory, purely professional non-relationship with Christina, that almost gets him fired and murdered presumably stays a caught up DJ and MC with another caught up relationship of the contractual fatherhood and non-emotional sexual relationship with his forward thinking employer, 5) Tracey, Francis' niece in a girl, hopefully goes into a prosperous profession, perhaps music, not involved in the sex industry, paradoxically succeeding Chrstina, when coming from an middle class family background although in a lower class family unit, although she did stop her free practice sessions.The major evils in their lives are in their past and the possibilities exist for the characters to move forward into a brighter future.More fired up professions are found in the tax inspector and the customs inspector, Egoyahn has previously filmed an insurance adjuster and a litigation lawyer.The theme of the difference between Earth night and day is evident. The characters activities differ. The artificial day of the airport at the start of the film is apparent as is the artificial light in the tanks of the tropical fish in their dank shop environment. Tracey is starting to return to her home after nightfall. The staff of the Exotica club have little to do during the day except brood and barely interact. The dead body is found by day. The dead relatives are seen only in video shot by day. The disabled man is seen only by day.The unique situation that arose from work intercourse between the Thomas and Francis is dangerously intriguing.Out of context the almost intimate ideas and perceptions that the tax inspector as the recovering and to be recovering grieving father communicates to his teenage niece and the teenage Christina can appear intense and longing for greater depth. He appears at once guilty of preying on them for interaction and socially respectably involved in their lives. Francis' need for contact draws him to be held by the bathroom stall.Christina's description of the tax inspector as a particular case and that he violated his role is noticeably mature speech for her and unexpected. Coming from a middle-class upbringing she has graduated from university, had a debating trip to San Francisco and yet found herself having worked for a period of time as a lap dancer, brought into the underworld of the sex industry by her now-ex partner. She isn't aware enough to aim to marry Francis whom she knew since her teens. In her talk with Thomas she shows the audience how she sees her situation only within the terms of her current situation. The audience is given the subtle understanding of how Francis' role for her has been different in their shared past. Christina as a heroine is an under-played theme.Main characters and their therapies 1) Thomas, minority sexual habits, * Cruising at a classical music venue. 2) Francis, under-the-table sexual habits, * Being danced for nightly. 3) Eric, assumedly normal sexual habits, being slightly perverted by his sex industry boss. The easyist to empathise and associate with for the majority of males. Uncontrollable jealously that surfaces later in the film. * Talking and listening to himself, even in an empty club. 4) Christina, university graduate. * Being idolized nightly, as a sexually awake schoolgirl. 5) Tracey, intelligent and articulate, from a good family. * Playing music to herself, in an empty home. Father using the hinted at marijuana. 6) Zoe, boss, forward planning, precise and formal. * Preparing future for generations.Lots of pretty, naked female bodies in the club. Good, carrying music by Danna, although not as emotional as his Sweet Hereafter score.Egoyan's work is similar to Leigh's in its glance at the intricate lives of full characters, and this film continues this gravitational style. In this film Egoyan fails the audience in not even giving veiled reasons for his characters situations. The desolate life of Christina doesn't fit with her history and no future is shown. Tracey is given little history and no future, her situation only described by the acting of Polley, the flitteringly self-assured actress of my generation. Recurring director theme of money is evident, the Sweet Hereafter is for the cause of money, here Francis buys drinks, coffees, a goodbye wad to Christina via Thomas, he was always paying me to do him this favour. Egoyan was given money by the winner of the Palm d'Or, almost in empathy of the film. The two darker skinned characters die. Recurring director theme of innocence brutalised and, perhaps due to his background and migration, blonde males being strange, richer and of higher status. Notably the two darker skinned characters in this film are killed.Egoyhan is to subtly intricacy as Lynch is to surrealism throughout the last quarter of C20.An intense, full, gravitational film.--- by Jerome, computer coder, author, and voter of 1,000 films.

At the first time that I see Exotica it is very gripping. It even mislead you in a way that in about first ten minutes of movies about what the story is really about. But after thinking about it for a while one can discover why it is gripping. Exotica makes the viewer to identify with a man who have all the bad lucks. His daughter is kidnapped and murdered, his wife cheat on him but he is so nice that he accepts that, and then his wife dies in an accident but her lovers remains alive, he is satisfied with a memorandum of his shattered life by going to the Exotica and have a private dance of a young girl but by the way of a setup he loses that too, and when he tries to get a revenge he is not capable to do that. The final scene which is a flashback underlines this point and in a final revelation we find out that this setup has taken away from our hero something that he cannot find anywhere else and in this regard has damaged him beyond the want of the culprit of this setup. And as if that is not enough Exotica has some less favorable characters who have pure luck. Like the smuggler the costume officer turns out to be a sex partner, his tax officer white washes his crime for a next to nothing small favor, and even when he commits the same offense that our good hapless protagonist is severely beaten and thrown out, his punishment is just a sweet smile and another touch by hand. Exotica has a good story and is told to maximum effect, but after thinking about it the final segment is that this movie does not further our knowledge of our world beyond what we already know. this fact is emphasized in the lyrics of the song that Christina dance with it in Exotica, and it says repeatedly that everybody knows.

Francis strikes a deal with one of his clients who is breaking the law to take revenge on Eric.I'm not a huge fan of Egoyan and have often found some of his stuff to be a little inaccessible and occasionally bordering on the pretentious.  This is one of my preferred works by him, but that's not to say that it's perfect.  The plot here see numerous ill-defined strands that centres not around the club but more around the themes of loss and relationships based on need and baggage.  These themes are well brought out even if the back story is pretty weak in most of them.  When the strands all come together it isn't a surprise &#150; it has been hinted at all along &#150; but it is a nice low key finish to the tale.It's hard to judge it as a film because it is too disjointed and abstract to really get into it.  It sort of made me want to stand back from it and observe it, rather than get involved &#150; like a picture for example.  This distant didn't help me get into the characters but made me watch it from the outside which wasn't as good.  The plot is weak but the telling is everything.  Egoyan delivers the telling well and weaves an interesting story &#150; told through the characters rather than events.The characters are delivered well by the actors although some have little to do. Greenwood does very well as Eric and brings a lot out and for my money Koteas is always watchable in anything he does (yes &#150; even Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles!).  Kirshner was too distant for me and I felt that she carried it too long and rarely let emotion touch her.  I suppose her character would need to be like that but it stopped me again from accessing the film.  McKellar is really a fringe player and the issues with his relationships and his smuggled eggs are basically lost in the mix in a quite frustrating manner. Happily I thought Greenwood and Koteas really held this together and kept my attention.The film may be flawed and be too distant and cold to be satisfying but Egoyan's telling is good and avoids being arty for art's sake or being pretentious.  It is not a fantastic film but it is different and deals with themes not seen often.  I found that I appreciated it rather than enjoyed it &#150; that may be the only way in.

While I was hoping to be dumbfounded by the end of this film by amazing cinematography and story, I actually lost focus on this film. For some strange reason, this film just didn't speak to me. Perhaps it is because there are handfuls of films with similar themes that have been done so much better. I was expecting a deeply depressing drama by the likes of which I have never seen, instead what I was handed was a cornucopia of bland over-dramatic cinema. It just felt like Egoyan was trying too hard. I think he knew what he wanted to accomplish, and the idea sounded great in his head, but sadly when he transferred it to the silver screen, it just didn't seem to match. This was a tough story to watch, and I could tell that Egoyan was having trouble behind the camera. The feeling of continuity, solidarity, and character structure was definitely missing from this film. To begin, I didn't hate this film. I thought that some of the actors did a decent job in front of the camera giving performances that I had not seen from them before. I am a fan of Bruce Greenwood's work (the little that he does), so it was impressive to see him branch out and explore his acting possibilities. Coupled with the overall depth of the film it did raise the bar a bit, but not far enough for my enjoyment. When Egoyan should have been showing us more of the meat of the story, he instead was overloading us with elongated images of actors crying, wandering, or just muttering off into the distance. I couldn't tell where Egoyan wanted to go with this film. Was it to be something that intellects would grab a hold of because of the conversations, or the drama saps because of the structure of the film? This should have been better defined by Egoyan, but instead we are left with too many clues without enough story.This is best shown by the ending. When Egoyan was trying to surprise us, it was instead a huge lackluster that forced us to wonder why we waded through an hour and a half of dribble just to seemed shocked by the ending. I agree, I never saw it coming, but that was because no clues were given to me to help me see the ending. I felt that Egoyan was grabbing at nothing, pushing characters together that did not really have to go together. I needed to see more interaction with the characters instead of just what happened with Greenwood's character. When you are looking to make film of this structure, it is always good to not focus on just one character. While one will stand out, it should be left up to the audience to make their decision on whom they like the most, unfortunately, Egoyan tagged early on that Greenwood would be the center of this story. This then caused the other characters to fall into second place and not get the screen attention or development that they deserved. We can see this with the confusing story that takes place. I mentioned this before, but I think Egoyan had a great idea, but could not translate it to the screen. What was the reasoning behind Eric and Exotica's owner's pregnancy? Why did Christina and the owner kiss? What ever happened to Christina and Eric's love? What truly happened between Francis and his brother? These were all questions that were never answered at all during this film. It was as if there was another story before this on and we were not given any of it to see. We needed to see more of the pre-story instead of what was given to us in the end. This would have helped build a stronger ending. Overall, I wasn't impressed. I didn't think it was bad, yet I wasn't blown away by it. I think that Greenwood is a great actor and did wonderful in this role, but sadly I couldn't attach myself to him because I was too confused with the story. Maybe I am wrong, buit it seemed like there were unanswered questions just left on the table throughout the film. These questions needed answers, but nobody was brave enough to answer them.Grade *** out of ***** "},{"Title":"A slow paced movie with no suspense nor erotic scenes to keep you interested.","Date":"11 April 2000","Score":"5 out of 11 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  I think I've seen X-rated flicks with better plots than this movie, and that is sad.

We do things for each other Deep stuff -- NOT.  More like the guy has the hots for the high school girl who babysat for him.  After seeing her, who wouldn't?  But it is still a much more pedestrian plot line.  (4) The longhaired guy is an idiot character who looks way too much like Antonio Banderas.  Plus, who would go to a strip club with such a lame DJ?  Ooooh all that mumbling and missing the ends of dances is making me hot...  Whatever.

Ultimately, I was disappointed. Egoyan's film is very carefully and tightly woven among several apparently disparate characters, and their complete relationships don't fully come together until the final scene.  If you like this type of slick film-making above a great story then you love this movie.  I like my films to have a story I can more personally identify with.  Once I found out everything there was to know about the characters in EXOTICA, I didn't really care that much about any of them.This movie has lots of pretty, nude females, and the highest ratings were given by males in the youngest age group!  No surprise.  However, for mature viewers a rating of 6 or 7 is about right.  I gave it 6 of 10 for excellent movie-making, but a pretty marginal story.Recent similar movies which combined both excellent film-making *and* excellent, tightly-woven stories are Fargo, Lone Star,and A Simple Plan, just to name three.  In my view, Exotica doesn't even come close.

But, LOL, calling Leonard Cohen a Tom Waits wannabe, that's the funniest thing I've heard all year.The photography in this film almost redeems its many failings, but not quite. I get a lot of chuckles from the gushing reviews from art-house hangers-on; there is a kind of Art-house cliché which arises from the deliberate avoidance of Hollywood cliché. This film is full of it. You might call it anti-cliché. But it amounts to the same thing. I see none of the freshness and vigour I look for in a good indy film.It mightn't be so bad if the plot didn't require so much suspension of disbelief. There couldn't exist a strip club such as this one, it would be just ludicrous.And why doesn't Mr. Egoyan find something else for his wife to do besides acting in all his movies? Anyhow, watch this if you've got nothing better on, but expect to be bored rigid waiting for the good bits.

I would have certainly kept my distance from the character with the very hairy chest. I do not even think that he knew what he was going to do next.

He touts the various dancers' merits and invites patrons to have one at their tables for just 5 dollars * Thomas - a shy young man who runs a pet shop and makes a lot of money illegally smuggling in rare birds' eggs. He patronises the opera and scalps tickets, only to hand the money back with an apology later. He uses this as a ploy to get gay encounters. * Francis Brown, who lost a young daughter by murder a few years ago. A regular Exotica/Christine patron. He pays pretty young niece Tracy Brown to babysit his non-existent daughter and pays her $20/hr - maybe he just like schoolgirls. Tracy senses that something is not right with this arrangement and while she wants the money, asks her dad to discontinue this practice. Francis is also a government auditor, checking out Thomas' business for almost certain tax fraud. Eric is clearly incensed with Francis' ongoing attentions to Christine and baits him into touching her, a strict no-no in the Exotica. He does this in the gents, while Francis can't see him - (though you'd think he'd easily recognise Eric's voice, there is no attempt made to disguise the latter). When Francis rather clinically does the deed, Eric reacts by violently ejecting him from the club. He is thereafter barred from entry and resolves to kill Eric using Thomas' father's old revolver. He blackmails Thomas into helping him Touch Christine, Eric will throw you out at the door, I'll be waiting with the gun and shoot him.It doesn't happen. Strange scenes of lines of people walking grassy fields are finally explained when Eric reveals that he was the one who finally found Francis' dead daughter - the public had been enlisted in the sweep search. Francis breaks down and instead of shooting Eric, embraces him. One mystery solved I suppose.The ending is enigmatic A pigtailed, bespectacled Christina (unrecognisable as Christine the dancer) complete with braces and full- covering daggy clothes takes a car ride with a youthful Mr Brown - I didn't recognise him, though he might be a shaven Francis. Either that or the Brown family males are closet schoolgirlophiles. He gives her money which she reluctantly takes, she tells him how she really enjoys these rides, then dismounts at a mansion. Or maybe this is the past, before she became Christina the dancer???The film has little erotic content. The club is dark, and displays of tits and ass are fleeting or distant. Christina is clearly well sculpted but what little one sees of her rather creditable breasts are always shrouded inside her unbuttoned shirt. The only love-making is between Thomas and a gay pickup.It is popular practise to produce a film which contains logical inconsistencies, or is deliberately obfuscationist, then call that great cinema. Give me a well-told story with a genuine mystery anyday. 5/10 "}{"Title":"could some tell me what was going on?","Date":"10 December 2000","Score":"5 out of 13 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  I rented this movie after a friend told me about it.

Get it at Amazon.)Atom Egoyan's Exotica is an outstanding movie. I have seen Egoyan's The Sweet Hereafter (1997) which is also very good. A father's (obsessive) love for his daughter(s) is featured in both movies, consequently the theme must mean something special to Egoyan. He is a most talented and original movie maker, a Canadian as are his players, Bruce Greenwood, (Francis Brown, the accountant whose daughter was murdered), Sarah Polley, (Tracey, the high school girl), and Mia Kirshner, (Christina, the exotic dancer). His wife, Arsinee Khanjian and Polley were also featured in The Sweet Hereafter.What really makes the movie is Egoyan's use of time and action sequence. He cuts up the chronological order of events and then presents them in a dramatic way. This is not so easy to do. Christopher Nolan in Memento (2000) used the same technique to great advantage. I have come late to such a technique and would love to master it myself. I worked on it last year and a couple of years before. You can't just scissor it and then paste it back together. Something must be gained from reversing the order of events. When Eric and Christina are shown walking the fields in a long line of people I jumped to the conclusion that Tracey would be found dead. We don't learn that Francis lost his daughter until the film is nearly finished.The psychology of Francis and the young girls is interesting. Christina says she gave something to him and he gave something to her. This vagueness with its unmistakable sexuality is something that always exists between young girls and older men. And, as Egoyan observes, there are rules and awkwardness, and confused emotions. However the girl wants it made unmistakably clear that she is desired physically and just talk is almost never sufficient. She often doesn't know whether she really wants to be taken fully, and of course that is usually, shall we say, problematic. Some great subtly is required in handled such a theme, and Egoyan realizes that. His character Francis Brown is content with fantasy and does not touch at all.This film would have found a larger audience except for the title, the theme, and the milieu. The female audience for the most part didn't even consider watching the movie since, as one woman said, I thought it was just another movie with an older man lusting after a girl half his age. That theme bores women to death. But surprisingly at the IMDb a viewer asks how women feel about the film and several write in to say that they liked it. Another poster remarks that women over forty actually liked Exotica in higher percentages than males.I thought the veracious and business-like depiction of the exotic dancer club was well done. The very nice side plot with the gay animal importer was just a perfect fit for the main plot. Egoyan wrote the script. It is a great script. So much surprises. It's almost too good. For me, since I have seen so many, many movies, something different, some surprises in plot, in character, in treatment are always welcome.And the plot does surprise. Even when the protagonist, Francis waits outside the club to shoot Eric, Egoyan turns the situation on its head by having Eric appear from the side and explain something that changes Francis's attitude toward him.I am being vague because I don't want to spoil the story. Some movies&#x97;most movies I would say, since I go back to the generation that would go into the theatre and sit down during the middle of the movie; and then four or five hours later, realize, This is where I came in--in most movies to know the ending or the plot would not spoil the movie. We know so and so dies at the end. What is interesting is how he dies, how the actions develops. But in this movie to know the plot would take something away.I think. I'm not sure. Anyway Francis is a tax auditor who lost his daughter when she was less than eight years old. She was murdered. The police initially thought he did it, but he was found innocent and the murderer was apprehended and convicted. But Francis is left hollow and tries to bring her back in a way by having teenage girls babysit his nonexistent daughter. Egoyan teases us near the beginning by showing Francis and Tracey in his car as he drops her off at her home giving her some money and asking, Are you free Thursday? Very near the end of the movie we find that Tracey had a precursor in that babysitting role. You might be able to guess who it was.The sound track features Everybody Knows by Leonard Cohen.
