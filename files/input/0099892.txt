But each of us has a different sense of humour and depth. JVTV is a subtle, witty film with morals, not like the bash 'em and blow 'em up Hollywood films of late. Meg Ryan shows her versatility as three separate, wonderfully funny characters and Tom Hanks (think of his character in The Money Pit but amusingly depressed) as Joe Banks trapped in a dead end job and is told he has a terminal illness. He is offered the chance to live like a king, die like a man by jumping into a volcano as part of a business deal where Joe gets to spend as much money as he likes before the big deed. Along the way Joe meets many characters who awaken him to the fact that life is worth living. This film is loaded with wonderful observations, a great score and songs, and standout performances. JVTV is one of those rare films you can easily watch again and again, and always makes me smile every time I see it.

This is the movie I would take to the desert island, which miraculously has electricity a big screen and a DVD player. This is one of those rare films where every single character, no matter how minor, has a major impact on the hero and the plot. This film is also rare because the Lion's share of the funny and insightful dialogue belongs to the minor characters and not the protagonists. You have to love a movie where a luggage salesman is a major plot milestone. Ossie Davis is excellent as the wise Limo driver, Lloyd Bridges is hilarious, Tom Hanks is of course everyman, and Meg Ryan, in one of her funniest roles, is actually every woman. You know, the first time I saw you I thought that I had seen you before. A witty hero is commonplace and witty cast is truly memorable.The movie is probably too allegorical for most tastes, but this is a great tale about a character afraid of life, afraid of that next step, who finds his courage and puts his foot forward again. All in all this is one of the best kinds of movies, Funny and Hopeful.

Joe has unfairly become an industry joke, shorthand for the depths to which Tom Hanks sank before redeeming himself with Academy Awards.  This fate is horribly undeserved. Joe is an imaginative and gloriously life-affirming movie, a hysterically funny fantasy nearly on a par with the best of Terry Gilliam with a carpe diem moral that comes across with a lot more honesty and a lot less preachiness than some other movies I could mention.  Every Tom Hanks performance is virtually flawless and this one ranks near the top.  Meg Ryan's performances are warm and hilarious.  Usually it's men who play more than one role in a movie and then it's more often for ego's sake than art's. Ryan pulls off her multiple characters with remarkable grace.  More amazingly, it makes perfect sense for her to play three characters.  For the sake of argument, I am willing to concede that there are those who just aren't going to enjoy this movie's unique mixture of whimsy and genuine emotion.  But for me, it's a classic, easily one of my favorite movies of the decade.

That is not to say that there is not romantic comedy in the story, but to say that it is the point of the film is monumentally short sighted. The real story in Joe vs. the Volcano is about coming to terms with yourself, finding that spark that we spend our lives searching for. It is about discovering our humanity and what that entails. Normally, this would end up being pretentious and sophomoric crap, but because the heavy subject matter is taken so lightly, we are treated to a modern fairy tale that runs the gamut in terms of emotional impact.

Joe(Tom Hanks), a seemingly passive man who's worked at adreadful, abusive, dead-end job for years is told he has anincurable disease (authoritatively diagnosed by physician RobertStack as a brain cloud.) Joe quits his job and receives an offerthe next morning to go on an all-expenses paid journey to a tinyisland...that will culminate with his leap into a volcano! Meg Ryan portrays three separate characters, and her glee inmasking her All-American Sweetheart screen persona ispalpable, particularly in the first segment. Even the occasionalgambits that fall slightly flat (for instance, Abe Vigoda's turn as aleader of island natives obsessed with orange soda) cannotseriously mar the overall brilliance of Shanley's work.As it turned out, the box-office failure of Volcano didn't deterHanks and Ryan from reteaming for the enormously popular butcomparatively colorless Sleepless in Seattle and You've GotMail. (It's probably no accident that these were far safercommercial bets than Joe, both owing large debts to earliermovies.) On the other hand, John Patrick Stanley has returned to craftingplays for live theater, apparently for good; one hopes his finelytuned ear and immense imagination will flourish in an environment that's largely removed from the demographicpanderings of Wal-Mart Nation. His gain is our loss. Earlier, I mentioned Frank Capra as a semi-analogue to Shanley.Perhaps this comparison may help If you are one of the many whocan't abide Capra's It's a Wonderful Life, you probably shouldstay away from Joe Versus the Volcano as though you had theplague...or even a brain cloud.9/10 "},{"Title":"Surprisingly Good, Unfortunately overlooked","Date":"14 December 2002","Score":"28 out of 35 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  Tom Hanks has made many movies, most of which are very funny, emotional, and heartwarming.

Ordinary characters and settings have subtle emotional undertones that tug at the heartstrings. Dan Hedaya and Sam Waterstone's performances, though humorous, have a tone that is more than the sum of its parts. Color and scenery also have a hidden beauty, such as in the scene with Joe's glowing warm in his cold, blue office, or the scene with the dog and child as he exits the doctor's office, or the scene with him all alone at his table at the hotel. I first saw the movie when I was 11 years old, even then, its beauty struck me. That beauty was well capped off by the montage during the end credits. Apparently, John Patrick Shanley, or someone, put alot of work in an otherwise ordinary movie. Imagine if Stanley Kuprick had directed You've Got mail. I'm surprised that the movie is not better known, especially that it is a big turning point in Tom Hanks career. Admittedly, his screen presence compensates for Meg Ryan's lackluster acting at times. She was best as a brunette and redhead than acting as herself. Nevertheless, a good movie, one to own and not just rent.

The most memorable part of this movie is definitely the sequence of Tom Hanks on the ocean before (and during) the moonrise, which is exquisite and simply beautiful. In fact, that sequence is quite possibly the finest acting Tom Hanks has ever done (we'll avoid mentioning his lamentation of mutilated soccer balls).Also, the soundtrack (by George Delerue) is at times funny, at other times lonesome, but is always elegant, simple, and masterful.

We first see Joe as a slave to a dehumanizing environment, only half-awake, and loosing his sole/soul.

If fortune smiles on him, he struts and boasts and attributes her favors to his own power and wisdom--which, as often as not, had nothing to do with it.

It looked rather silly and wish washy. One afternoon i had just lost my job and it was raining outside so I was feeling crappy and then this movie came on the television. With nothing better to do I watched it and totally fell in love. Its a story about life, love and regret. Tom Hanks plays Joe Banks, we first encounter Joe walking into work with his colleagues as they stagger almost zombie like to their mundane jobs. Joe is constantly feeling ill and goes to the doctor who proceeds to tell him he has a 'brain cloud' and only has a short time left to live. Joes first reaction is to tell his horrible boss to shove his job and asks the girl he has always fancied out on a date - I mean why not? whats the worst that could happen? And so we find the beginnings to the moral of the story. Joe is then offered a chance by a millionaire to live like a king, all expenses paid, do anything he wants and then jump into a volcano to appease a community of natives he needs minerals off to sell his product. So Joe sets off on his Odyssey of discovery, meeting a variety of weird and wonderful people (including the fantastic Meg Ryan in 3 different roles) and experiencing 'life'. What makes Joe Versus the Volcano so great is a mixture of all the elements. The characters he runs into are interesting, quirky and funny. The direction is sublime including running themes which you only notice upon multiple viewings. The music is beautiful, just beautiful complimenting the imagery perfectly. What all great films need are stand out scenes. Scenes you remember long after the film finishes. JVtV has a load. The moment Joe finds out he has a brain cloud and stands outside for ages as the world passes him by, the musical montage after his date with his work colleague, the moment Joe sits on the beach and watches the sun rise, the luggage man, the montage on the raft and especially the moment he sees the moon rise and Joe thanks god for his life. Its just such a wonderful film that deserves more recognition. I don't think this is a film for cynics but for romantics and dreamers like me.

It deals with great themes of humanity the influence of fear, courage and compromise on the destiny of a single person. Those who don't get it probably only see a simple story about the life of one boring, ordinary man. It is sad that so many people miss, or are oblivious to, its deep beauty. This movie is the rarest of delights; it is visual literature, performed with heart and beauty rarely seen in our modern age.Joe is a long-suffering factory worker that leads a life of quiet despair. One day opportunity finds him, one so overwhelming it allows him to break out of this hateful life and live a new, amazing one, even if it is only to be short-lived. This opportunity comes to Joe in the form of a wealthy businessman, who wants to reward him handsomely for jumping into a volcano, in exchange for which the businessman will get land right in a primitive island for a rare material he needs for his superconductors. Joe then learns he has a fatal disease that will soon take his life; so in typical victim of life style, he simply goes along with the idea. Yet behind his decision we can see that Joe realises that this will be his last chance to break free from his sad life, and like the strange businessman said, go out in a blaze of glory. As Joe steps into his new life, he finds himself emboldened to chase after what he desires, true love, because he knows his time is short. But he is rejected by the object of his affection (the office worker Meg Ryan) and is rocked by the experience. Now, totally alone and with so little time to live, he faces a roller coaster ride of self discovery. The little steps in Joe's growth are wonderfully portrayed and occur with the support of some wonderful characters. Yet at each stage of his growth, Joe encounters fate in and around Meg Ryan characters &#x96; symbolising his lost desire, temptation and the elusive true love. The rebirth of Joe into his new life is probably the key theme of the story. In eventually getting to the volcano and facing his greatest fear, Joe gives up his life as he promised he would &#x96; proving the depths of his honourable character. But out of certain death Joe receives a miraculous reprieve - all at once Joe conquers all the events of his life that conspired to make him ordinary, and in giving himself up to this honourable death, he is rewarded with a miraculous survival and everything he could ever want for a truly happy life. He is reborn into a new man! The implication of the new life, though, is not that of a fairytale, but rather a gift of new knowledge and experience that is only achieved after his remarkable sacrifice. Joe is gifted with a mind-expanding awareness and experience of exhilaration. It all works as an effective allusion to the fundamental truth in life that every major achievement derives from sacrifice, and the reward is a new set of privileges and challenges. Wonderful.The fact that such deep truisms of life are so effectively intertwined with a simple story of an ordinary man is one I love a lot. I get totally absorbed into Joe - all externalities are almost non-existent in this movie - the movie is about a single reality, that of the life of Joe. This is a truly rare achievement, as most movies use actors as vehicles for external, rather than internal action. But this movie is all about the growth and change in Joe, one he does not even fully appreciate is happening. Hanks' genuine portrayal of innocent and kind spirit makes the experience desirable and the conclusion genuinely surprising and worthwhile. Meg Ryan and all supporting cast members are also brilliantly effective. This movie is a mountain brought to life from a molehill by the breath and breadth of acting talent, direction, editing and writing skill.To view this movie without perceiving its deeper meaning would be to ignore its true value and hence make it easy to dismiss. Yet the humble observer who can accept the influence of things greater than themselves will perceive the true nature of this remarkable movie, and as a result engage in a truly beautiful, emotional and thought provoking experience.

I think this movie was a delight. I saw it as a child, and catch it every time it comes on. It captures the hopelessness and drudgery of corporate life, and with imagination expands on how far an individual will go to escape it. Living like a king for a few days then facing death is preferable to continuing your current existence...and yet finding meaning to life in the process. And it's done in a comedic way. I love it. It is simple yet with a obvious meaning as it's backbone. It's a fun feel good movie with subtle dark undertones and uplifting positive consequences. It's so quirky and silly, while being about depression and death that I guess I've always found it charming. Also Tom Hanks is easily one of the best actors in the past 30 years.This movie is just good ol fashion fun and should be given a shot.

By now, early 2008, we have come to expect great things from him, and even here, in this outlandish little black sheep of a film, he shows us that early Hanks charm for which he is so known and loved. The scene when he is dancing by himself on top of the makeshift raft is a classic, for sure! Meg Ryan, on the other hand, another hugely talented actor, mostly shows here why she doesn't do accents. She also, of course, has charm and presence, but she is very much overshadowed by Tom's. The important thing here is that they both exist in a terrible world ruled by the 40 Hour Work Week, presided over by the Terrible Boss and the cripplingly depressing atmosphere. Joe (Hanks), for example, believes that the fluorescent lights in his depressing office are slowly driving him crazy.He goes to see a doctor, who tells him that he has something called a brain cloud, which will kill him in six months but won't affect him physically until then. Of course, this diagnosis is the perfect reason to quit his job and tell off his boss, so Hanks gets a telling-off scene that is so good that you may wonder why Julia Roberts was ever allowed to do it in just about ever movie she ever made after Pretty Woman. Why didn't it become a staple in Hanks' films? At any rate, Joe decides to leave his stifling job and live his life to the fullest, which of course leads in the most bizarre direction possible, to him being hired to become sacrifice himself to the volcano gods. The movie is, of course, at its most zanily creative with this idea, and yet the natives inhabiting the island are one of the only gags that just don't work. Lloyd Bridges is classic as the natives' chief, but a group of religious native islanders that worship orange soda? Come on Mr. Shanley, you can't use even the horrendous January Man as an excuse for THAT one...Nevertheless, the movie is a curious romp into the imagination, and still has the presence of mind to make suggestions about life, reminding us once again of that all important rule of never giving in to the intolerable seriousness of it all...

Before Sleepless in Seattle and You've Got Mail, future superstars Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks first practiced their romantic magic in this film. The cinematic structure of pairing emotive visual scenes with modern musical classics that was so successfully employed in Sleepless saw it's first rendering here. And the story showcased Meg Ryan's versatility, giving her a vehicle in which she could play three distinctly different characters with her characteristic energy and charm. Second, the film shares a warm insight into the character of uptown Manhattan (and a bit of the downside of the other boroughs) that allows you to get a sense of why people of all walks of life love -- and occasionally hate -- to live there. We learn that, contrary to Hollywood's perception, The Plaza was a fine hotel, certainly, but (as one who has been to both) it is NOT The Pierre. We see that shopping on Fifth Avenue is often a passion not only for the purchaser but the vendor as well. And we discover that the REAL average New Yorker is wise, knowledgeable, talented, and compassionate.Third, it is imbued with a light-hearted, sometimes wacky sense of humor that still manages to carry a moral thread and -- all too rare anymore -- a happy ending. Yes, in spite of the exploitive plans of powerful people, in spite of the fears and neuroses induced by sophisticated society, in spite of the chaos and cataclysms of capricious Nature, the guileless, persistent, and romantic couple with hope in their hearts can still overcome it all. In other words, your kids can enjoy this, and you can too.In a skit on Saturday Night Live long ago, singer/composer Paul Simon chided Tom Hanks for appearing in this movie. Apparently genteel entertainers of Paul's caliber (at least in those olden days) aren't supposed to lower themselves to such roles... especially those that lampoon Hollywood's hollow plasticity. No matter. I, for one, usually take such pretentious dissuasion as a recommendation. When it comes to Joe vs. the Volcano, I suggest you and your family do, too.

But that's the reality of Hollywood in the early 21st century. It's a lot different now than it was then.What it looks like to the average observer is that John Patrick Shanley, fresh off the success of Moonstruck, decided to indulge himself a little bit here and write something a little campier, a lot stranger, and totally off the path of his Oscar-winning masterpiece. The story is like the intersection of a typical hero film, a typical romance, a typical local-boy-and-downtrodden-good-guy comes through in the end, and a cartoon.But the most surprising thing about this movie is that it actually works.What makes it work is Tom Hanks, just about the only actor with the sensitivity and the sense of humor to pull off the role. Nobody in the last 20 years infuses a quirky character with loveability the way Hanks does - Jim Carrey comes close in The Truman Show, but that's about all. Hanks carries this movie the way he carried Punchline and Big, both of which were also incredibly underrated comedies.Watch the way he stands on the deck of the Tweedledee and hesitates before he throws his expensive hat into the ocean - a subtle gesture laden with shockingly deep layers of complexity and character. It's such a stupid detail maybe, but there's so much more to it than that.The second most surprising thing about this movie is that Meg Ryan is actually good. Right before she plunged her entire acting career into the trite, cutie-pie, puppy dog schlock of her cookie-cutter mid-90s romantic comedies, she actually managed to project depth in this movie, not to mention range. She may come off as cartoonish, but she plays three characters differently enough that you actually think they're three different people, right before you laugh at how ridiculous the entire thing is.What I remember most about this movie, though, are the scenes with Joe on the floating luggage raft, where he seems to divide his time equally between the totally silly and the utterly spiritual. Hanks manages to convey this beautifully, whether he's making up superfluous cowboy tunes on a ukulele or bowing to the moon in solemn reverence and thanking God for his life. Despite its numerous contrivances (the bottled water, the world-band radio, the floating luggage itself), it's powerful.All of it is dressed up with some very vivid and inviting details and some top-notch dialog, which is the perfect ribbon for the gift that is this movie.On its surface, any summary of this movie makes it sound ridiculous. But the beauty here is how it's actually done. It's contrived, but it never pretends to be anything other than contrived. Its message is simple and predictable, but its simplicity and predictability do nothing to sabotage its power. Right at the start, the music box and the once upon a time give away that it's a fairy tale, and why should there be anything wrong with that? What emerges at the end (or more likely, somewhere in the middle) is a movie with a heart. So don't feel ridiculous if you liked this movie, or even if you loved it. We all know how fairy tales end, and more to the point, how they're told. And this one is told exceptionally well. What's not to love?

This line ends up being very important; he says it again to Patricia (also Meg Ryan), and even though he doesn't say it to Angelica (ALSO Meg Ryan), Patricia's sister, it's clear that he's thinking it.Yes, welcome to the oddly metaphysical world of Joe Versus The Volcano.The plot, in a nutshell Joe Banks has about the most depressing job in the most depressing place ever, finds out he has less than 6 months to live, quits his job, and is offered the opportunity by an eccentric millionaire (played by Lloyd Bridges, one of many terrific smaller parts in this movie) to go on a spending spree and a South Seas cruise, but only if he's willing to jump into a volcano on the island of Wapani Woo, in order to help him keep doing business with them. He does it, and ends up falling in love.Tom Hanks puts in a brilliant understated performance; in fact there's much about this movie that's understated. It looks so lightweight, but nonetheless, much of the dialogue is philosophical discussion. Hanks deserved an Oscar nod. And John Patrick Shanley deserved an Oscar nod for the screenplay; it's full of irony, and as I just said, the movie looked so simple, but was actually so complex. But the real snub was Meg Ryan. Playing three different parts with three different personalities, this is the best and most entertaining Ryan has ever been. Her performance is a work of genius, but because this movie was overlooked, her performance was too. The complexity of Joe's relationship with these three women is almost a sidebar to the movie's central theme (the long, winding road of life, as it says elsewhere on this site), but it seems to be implied that he's met her many times before finally getting it right with Patricia. It's this idea of the soulmate (the soul is another recurring theme) that really resonated with me.This was before Hanks started getting the attention he always deserved, with Philadelphia and Forrest Gump. Philadelphia was a fine serious role, and Forrest Gump was good, but I'll take Joe Versus the Volcano over them any day. The movie was just so well-done, with entertaining performances all around (Also appearing are Robert Stack, Ossie Davis, Dan Hedaya, Amanda Plummer, Abe Vigoda, and Carol Kane as a hairdresser- blink and you'll miss her!). In short, Joe Versus The Volcano is a fine little comedy with a big heart and big themes that deserved better treatment than it got the first time around.

He lives in a dingy one bedroom apartment on Staten Island, works for an evil boss in a drab ugly office complete with flickering fluorescent lights and other members of the living dead, all essentially waiting to die instead of living.

Hanks is brilliant as the hypochondriac trapped in a sort of 9 to 5 purgatory. And no matter how many times I see it, the scene where he unsteadily rises to gaze at the enormous moon always gets me. The tears just flow. I also love the moment where he gets out of his car and hugs the old woman with a Great Dane. Many moments such as these exist in this film and most don't have dialogue bogging them down. Just music over a little vignette. Meg Ryan is good too, playing three versions of the same woman.

Slow to get to the point, slow to get started. That is an important clue to deciding whether or not to see this movie, and how you feel about it afterward.This film doesn't have a plot so much as it has a journey. Like all 'journey' movies (no, not the 80s band, eeew), if the path the characters are taking doesn't resonate with you, the film will seem to drag on and on.The metaphors and path of JVtV (for me) center around the idea of belonging and believing. Joe neither belongs nor believes in his life at the beginning of the movie. The terminal illness gives him something to believe in (his life will soon end) and Lloyd Bridges' proposal gives him to belong to (the quest to jump in the volcano). By the end of the movie, he belives his life is worthwhile and he belongs to himself.I think this is the best of the Hanks-Ryan movies (You've Got Mail being the worst) because it lets them be themselves and not just a cutesy couple. Hanks was still principally a comic actor at this point, and his sardonic persona, especially turned on himself (Whenever I start to talk about myself I get bored.) and Meg Ryan's self-involved detachment (I have no response to that.) are what made them an appealing pairing in the first place.Anyway, if you get a chance, give it a chance. One note - I think you're more likely to enjoy this movie if you watch it alone. The metaphors are easier to see and appreciate without another presence to distract you.

About thirty seconds into the film you will come across a film image.  What you will see is a man who has given up on life, asking the sky why with only his body language, while everyone around him does not care, but rather continues on the path he's walking.  The path is not just a road, as the camera shows us; it is a unique and troubling crooked road.  If you have come to this part in the film and you are not thoroughly engrossed in this man's life, then you should immediately postpone watching the film for another couple of years until you are ready to witness an experience that may change your life.This film is indeed not for everyone.  The humour is sophomoric, the plot simple, but for those who love and understand film, who stay up late at night and try to wonder just what is out there in the stars, for those who do not even try to describe the wonder of the moon.  This is film poetry. You might not be ready for the experience, but if you are in the right mind, at the right time, the adventures of this average Joe will touch you.Rewind it, listen to the music again, try to understand the re-occurring image of the duck, but don't just skip through this film.

He struck just the right note in a role that could have easily been a throwaway.Meg Ryan was great in two out of the three roles in this movie; I thought the first was a little too one-dimensional.  Hanks is great as a former hero-turned-hypochondriac whose environment is draining the life out of him. You can see where Hanks is beginning to make the transition from manic comic to mature, understated actor.  His bathing scene (intercut with a corresponding balletic bathing scene for Meg Ryan) is a great satirical sequence.  And my favorite line from the movie is Hanks (may not be exact) I love you.  It's great!  It's wonderful! ... but the timing stinks.** Possible mild SPOILER **Other memorable performances include Dan Hedaya as a plant manager for a company that makes vaguely defined (but ominous) medical devices; Robert Stack as the doctor who tells Hanks he only has a short time left to live; the Luggage Salesman; Nathan Lane and Abe Vigoda as natives of Wapani Wu, the island where Hanks plans on throwing himself into the Big Wu, the volcano at the center of the island.If you're looking for something creative and different, where a few ideas don't work but most do, then JVTV is a great way to spend a couple of hours.

The first minutes of the film, until Joe is called into the doctor's office, are filmed almost in black and white.  The tones are all grey, black, or taupe, with some glaring whites.  Then the door to the doctor's office opens to show warm leather, paneling, and firelight, and it's a sudden reminder of _The Wizard of Oz_, when Dorothy opens the door into Oz and the movie changes from black and white to color.I also look for the crooked path, which shows up four times at different parts of the movie.  When Joe says, We've come a long way on a crooked path, we know exactly what he's referring to!I could go on with these details for pages, but I don't want to leave out the main reason this is my favorite film.

Joe's luggage is more than just a prop that he takes with him on his life's journey - it's a literal representation of everything that we carry with us as we struggle through our lives. We're very fond of referring to our emotional baggage and we're encouraged to ditch it at every opportunity in our quest to become better individuals.Yet not once, but twice, Joe's luggage proves to be his life-saver. The first time is after the sailing boat sinks, and he and Patricia are cast adrift on the salvaged suitcases. Inside the suitcases, Joe finds everything he needs to survive, to save Patricia's life, and indeed to amuse himself.And, in the end, when Joe and Patricia take that leap of faith into the vast unknown (life as it really is when you take a risk from which there can be no turning back) and are spewed out into the ocean... it is again that unsinkable baggage that rescues them from certain drowning.So our emotional baggage can sometimes become the life-sustaining force that prevents us from faltering and failing.

The lines come in speeches and poetry more like Shakespeare that what we're used to seeing in movies.Give this one another chance. Or, if you haven't seen it, watch it with patience and wonder. You won't regret it. This is Shanley's best work, even better, in my opinion, than his much more successful Moonstruck.

This movie is a modernization of early French and German expressionist films.Unless you've studied film history, this movie will likely go way over your head. But what John Patrick Shanley has done is truly unique. He has created a modern motion picture in the style of Cinema's early years. This movie was basically made asking the question, What would the early filmmakers do if they made movies today?.The beginning of this film is done as German expressionism, specifically referencing Fritz Lang's Metropolis. If you've seen the first five minutes of Metropolis, you'll recognize it instantly. Once they get out on the ocean, you start to get wisps of George Melies' storybook films (moons were really big with him). This trend continues until the famous, hauntingly beautiful moonrise scene, which would make Melies himself very proud.The early stylings rub off on other parts as well, specifically it's use of unreal lighting. Various colored lights are used throughout the movie, giving them a very artistic look. Another early style mimicked here is film tinting. This happens in one scene in particular. When Joe and Patricia are on the deck of the boat before the typhoon hits, the entire image is tinted green. Early filmmakers in the silent era did this all the time to give specific scenes a certain feel before color film existed.I have to give credit to George Delerue for giving this movie one of the most beautiful, exquisite, and awesome musical scores I have ever heard on a movie. I always watch this movie LOUD because I love the music so much.Joe Versus the Volcano is a modern classic and one of my all-time favorite films. DO NOT watch this movie in Pan & Scan.

During the voyage Joe and Patricia survive disaster, fall in love, and finally arrive at the island where they face their destiny.......On repeat viewings, its clear to see why this failed at the box office, it was pitched as some goofy romantic comedy, but its more than that. It's a fairy tale, a fable about mans destiny and goals, and how very few of us actually chase them.Plus, it's very dark to boot. You'd be forgiven if you thought you were watching a Tim Burton, even Fritz Lang film to begin with, and it's this first part of the film that makes or breaks the rest.Joe's workplace is a heady mix of Brazil and Metropolis, and its a cold, bleak depiction of an unwanted job. If you can appreciate the jet black humour in this, the rest of the film is more lighter, more of a relief, which is ironic as we are following Joe to his most certain demise.Ryan plays three characters in this, and I believe she is a subliminal narrative arc, depicting Joes different stages of character, as each character Ryan plays becomes more confident, more stronger than the last, much like Joes metamorphosis during the film.Hanks is as reliable as he ever was in his kooky stage, and the fantastic chemistry is evident between the two.

Yes, it was pretty much trashed by the critics, but movies are funny; they are completely subjective, so one person's swallop is another's caviar. So who is Joe? He's a miserable man trapped in a rotten life and all his options have long faded away. But a weird proposition comes to him and being so miserable, he accepts. So begins his journey to the volcano. In the telling of the tale, we see why Joe is so miserable (he does have reasons)and why the offer given to him was accepted. He meets new people on the way, discarding his old life completely. His life becomes a roller coaster of new experiences, some good, some not so much. But all through it, he seems to keep his balance, unfortunately because he expects to receive nothing and is pleased and surprised when something great happens. Meg Ryan plays three different characters and they all interact with Joe on a different level.

The story is SO understandable and, at times, clichéd, that it turns itself from an actual story into an allegory of a story. There's some pretentiousness, certainly, but the simple-mindedness of it should be forgiven by just how entertaining it is. The characters are fantastic and well played (my favorite is the luggage guy, and when I tell people may you live to be a thousand years old, sir they never get it. their loss) and I thought the pacing and dialog were great. It's funny, light in the best ways with just a few of those moments where Joe takes stock and says what people need to hear a relatable character say.Some of the parody might be too in-your-face, like the office scene. But the thing is, that's a great scene, hilarious and very satisfying. Meg Ryan is good here, and I usually don't think she's a great actress. Tom Hanks is, well, Tom Hanks, the perfectly-manufactured everyman. I'm a cynical bastard today, and this isn't my normal kind of film. I like darker movies, and usually shrug off pap. But I still enjoy JVTV, so I'd recommend that those who haven't seen it give the film a chance. It's not for everyone, but if you are one of the people who enjoys it, then you will REALLY enjoy it.

Hanks, still early into his burgeoning film career, hits two wildly exaggerated extremes in his portrayal of Joe, the hopeless working stiff who learns he's got roughly six months to live and rediscovers the miracles of spontaneity. Behind the film's absurd premise and a few witty, hilarious caricatures lies a pointed, layered look at the trappings of modern society and the gray fog we spew around ourselves to cope with our dull nine-to-five schedule. It's an original take on the message, and one which is constantly reinforced by a quirky, distinct visual style and playful personality. Hanks is as eccentric as ever, flying around the screen like a kid chasing a superball, while Ryan stretches herself with three wildly different roles. Loads of fun, even if the ending flies a bit over the top. "},{"Title":"A fable that grows on you.

I think it is the 'I know he can get the job, but can he do the job' scene. I really do think that movie is better than most people say it is. I have always seen it as a study in loneliness. If you look at his lamp in his office, the whole events of the movie are on there in summary- the travel on over the ocean on a ship, the big volcano on a little island, even the colors from the lampshade are the same colors used in the movie.My theory on this and why Meg Ryan keeps showing up in different roles? Joe never leaves the office. His sickness is not a 'brain cloud.' He really has cancer and, while staring at the lamp in his office, he dreams of a different life where he escapes the sickness and trivialities of his daily life. The only real Meg is the one in the office. She is the only female Joe has been around on a regular basis for a long time and because of this he has idolized her. Things do not go well with her in his imagination because it is Joe telling himself 'I can do better than this,' so he dreams up the idealized image of the 'California Girl,' who also falls short when Joe decides the he could do even better than that.Look for the theme of lamps in the movie. Joe hates the lights of the office. He has the Hawaiian lamp. The doctor's office has a ton of lamps, and a light on the desk that looks like a lamp bulb. Almost every image until they get to the boat is filled with lamps.Also, look at the colors at the start of the movie and in the office. Everything is drab. Bright color is not introduced, other than through the lamp, until Joe finds out that he is going to die. Even after this, when Joe goes back to the office and quits, the color is not as drab as it was until he found out that he is going to die.Why?Because everything after the initial scenes in the office are part of Joe's imagination. He dreams a of a different version of his real visit to the doctor. One in which he is diagnosed with a sickness that is not real, and is escape-able, unlike his real sickness.These are just some thoughts to consider next time you watch the movie.

There's a great line in it that goes, My father says that almost the whole world is asleep. Everybody you know. Everybody you see. Everybody you talk to. He says that only a few people are awake and they live in a state of constant total amazement. I think that anyone who doesn't get this movie is one of those who are not only asleep, but REFUSE to wake up. This movie is just so rich in metaphor and symbolic visual images, it's nothing short of a masterpiece. The best way to describe this movie is to call it a modern day existentialist romantic fairy tale. I'm one of those people who watch some movies all the way through just to get to a scene where the principal character or someone else says something meaningful, or especially funny. A couple of examples are The scene in The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly where Clint Eastwood's character says, I never saw so many men wasted so badly. the other is in The Outlaw Josey Wales, where Josey goes to the Comanche chief Ten Bears and makes peace with his words of death/ words of life speech. This movie is full of such moments, like the line I quoted above. But, especially for anyone who's been or felt stuck in a dead-end job that they hated, it has to be the scene where Joe Banks (Tom Hanks) gives one of the best Take This Job and Shove It speeches ever put in a movie. I'm not going to quote the whole thing here, just the line where he tells his scrofulous toad of a boss, Mr. Waturi, (Dan Hedaya), You look like a bag of s#%t stuffed in a cheap suit. The rest of it is just laugh out loud HILARIOUS. I also love all three of Meg Ryan's characterizations. I wonder if part of her reason for doing it was as an homage to Peter Sellers. I saw a comment from one of those who didn't seem to get it to the effect that there's nothing funny about a terminal illness. If it were a real one, I could agree. But when it's a FAKE one, then it IS funny. I mean, come on, lighten up! How could anyone BUT a hypochondriac take something called a brain cloud seriously? I also thought it was great that even as Dr. Ellison, (Robert Stack) is giving Joe this fake diagnosis, he is also giving him a TRUE one. You'll have to watch the movie to see what I mean. I could go on and on, but I'm running out of room. Just watch for Marshall the limo driver, (Ossie Davis), and the luggage salesman, (Barry McGovern), in a couple of stellar small roles. About the only thing I can think of to complain about is that there's no explanation of how the Waponi either got hooked on orange soda, or where they get it.

She offers an I believe in myself credo, and Hanks basically says that when he thinks too much about himself, he gets bored out of his mind.  The chemistry between the two is wonderful. Best single line in the movie (which gets used a lot around our house) I have no response to that! You owe it to yourself to give this film a second look.

Joe vs the Volcano has more in common with Groundhog Day than with the average romantic comedy.  This isn't a film about falling in love.  It's about how much of our lives is spent wasting time on things we don't care about.  The film has a serious philosophical underpinning that many people (most particularly the majority of the critics in 1990, Roger Ebert being a notable exception, as is often the case) somehow missed in their haste to label it as a romantic comedy, a screwball comedy, or a fill-in-name-of-label comedy.

Those of you who hated it already have your minds made up and anything I say won't change it.Before Sleepless in Seattle and You've Got Mail, Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan starred in a romantic comedy called Joe Vs.

The chemistry between Tom & all three of Meg's characters is wonderful.

Lloyd Bridges, Robert Stack, Abe Vigoda, Dan Hedaya, Amanda Plummer, Ossie Davis, Carol Kane.

As for Meg, she hasn't matched the acting ability that she showed in this movie.Another great thing about Joe is the music.  Just look at the soundtrack listing...Eric Burdon, Ray Charles, Elvis Presley and the wonderful theme Marooned Without You by director Shanley and Georges Delerue.Yes, Joe Vs.

When Carol Kane (as the hairdresser) comments on Joe's new haircut by  saying Shazaam, it reminded me of the superhero who'd change from his alter-ego to his hero form by saying that (this superhero's name escapes me). Also, that lightning bolt symbol was used by this superhero as well. When you later hear Joe talk about his wanting to be a hero, you can see how he's changed from *his* mild-mannered alter-ego.Hanks being in this role is very appropriate, since his best roles are always those of everyman. In this film, he is everyman, but the everyman who gets to live out his hero wishes.Meg Ryan is delightful in her 3 roles, especially those of the 2 sisters.

I especially enjoyed the numerous references to one's soul, and believe the theme of the movie was summed up in one line (uttered on the sail boat by the last Meg Ryan character), which was similar to Most people go through life asleep, and those who don't are in a state of constant amazement.  This, in my opinion, is one of life's foundations if we don't truly live the moment, our lives will fly by without us ever living it.  Pretty heavy stuff, but true.  And this film does a great job of presenting it.   Yet once the couple lands on their destination island, things get a bit too slapstick.  The silly orange soda references, the goofy islanders, etc., were too over-the-top, and took away from what really is an important message.   Until the island scenes, the film did a nice job of riding the line between somber commentary and humorous moments.   It's unfortunate that balance couldn't be kept though the end.

What people do you deal with? Dede/grungy, Angelica/waspish, or Patricia/delectable? All three are played perfectly by Meg Ryan.

Joe V. the Volcano is a story of a man who felt he had lost himself. The breaks were not going his way and it took an eccentric millionaire to break him out of the funk.Joe did not buy himself happiness. He bought himself luggage, and he bought himself a much needed haircut, but he did not buy himself a new life, and a new love. Joe found both of those things on his own. It is no mistake that the movie takes very strange and crazy turns. It is no mistake that Joe truly feels the strength of his spiritual self while stranded on a boat, and it is not a mistake that Joe realizes what is important in life by the end of the movie.Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks combine to give this movie, which may not have been excellent without the acting, a much deserved brilliant cast.

Abe Vigoda as the half Jewish, half Polynesian chieftain, Dan Hedaya as the mindless and oppressive boss, Lloyd Bridges and Robert Stack and of course Amanda Plummer in yet another totally bizarre roll as the enigmatic Dagmar.If you look even deeper the movie shows us that our self actualization should not be based on some slavish work-a-day existence.  The whole movie is one big metaphor.  The volcano represents the system in which healthy, productive and basically good people are sacrificed in the name of keeping that status quo.  Joe and DeDe show that with their love and faith in each other (and in a good set of steamer trunks) they survive being sacrificed to the system and are in turn rejected by it.If you want to get scary deep you might even derive an anti-semitic message from the movie given that the Waponies are half Jewish and sacrifice people to the system (but offer up no sacrifices themselves).

The fantasy in this film really takes you away to a different kind of world, it's escapism. The first part of the movie is the closest part to ugly reality with Joe (Tom Hanks) working in a dismal factory with soul crushed workers and a miserable boss. Joe even makes a pun related to this. Deedee (Meg Ryan) asks Joe why he looks so unhappy. Joe, who has just pulled off his shoe, looks at the sole of his shoe coming off and says I'm losing my sole (soul). Losing his soul is just what seems to be happening to him, he's lost his spirit and his smile. Joe's also a hypochondriac who keeps going to doctors. One day, in a doctor's office, the doctor (Robert Stack) tells Joe he has a  Brain cloud, a very rare, life threatening, incurable illness in his brain. He tells Joe he has only six months to live, and that there's nothing anyone can do to change that.After that is when the movie really changes. He quits his job and tells his boss where to shove it. Then, he takes Deedee on a date, totally wowing her with his new found spirit. This is where we get the if there's no tomorrow, I can do whatever the hell I want theme. Bill Murray did the same thing in Groundhog day when he suddenly started running over mailboxes and driving on the train tracks cause he realized, no tomorrow, no consequences. The next morning, Joe gets a visit from Loyd Bridges (a very rich man) giving Joe the offer of a lifetime. Well, an offer for the rest of his lifetime. Joe finds out that he will totally and completely live it up for three weeks, followed by him having to jump into a volcano. Bridges says that the volcano island tribe people won't give him a rare mineral needed for his super conductors unless he sends someone to the island to jump into their volcano. As you can see, the fantasy part of the movie is starting now. Bridges tells Joe live like a king! die like a man!. We see then Joe being given several of Bridges' credit cards being told  you've got no spending limit. Then we see Joe going shopping for new suits, luggage, etc., Joe staying at the Pierre in New York, him flying first class to LA, going out to a fancy restaurant in NY and in LA, then traveling a pleasure yaht slowly towards the volcano island of the South Pacific. Along the way he meets a pretty girl in LA (Angelica) and then another pretty girl (Angelica's sister Patricia) who joins Joe on the yaht. Both girls are played by Meg Ryan. The days and nights on the yaht, and on a sort of a life raft (made of Joe's large suitcases tied together) after a storm tears the ship apart. That's the period of time where the fantasy wonders of the world, and of life really come to wake. Patricia tells Joe, most of the world is asleep, only a few of us are really awake and we're in a constant state of amazement. Patricia's statement comes at a time where what she says relates to the happening circumstances. All alone surrounded only by things of God, away from the cities, the rat race, the stresses, pushes and hustles. There are some almost magical, surreal types of visions seen in the sky. It is like their whole world anymore is just them and an endless stretch of surrounding ocean. I can understand how then the sky can almost take on a mystical life of its own. Look at Joe's face while looking at the moon. Its almost as if he's not just seeing the moon, but he's seeing the light, cause he's on the brink of dying from hunger and thirst, having little hope of ever reaching any land.

But, I'm changing my mind because I think there's more to this film than is immediately apparent.Superficially it's just another comedy. And, that seeming superficiality is accentuated by the title -- Joe Versus The Volcano; it even sounds shallow.What sets this above the average comedy is that it's all about humor WITHIN RELATIONSHIPS. And not just permanent relationships, but how we relate to everyday people we may only come across by accident. We start off in a work setting this is devoid of human relationships -- Joe (Tom Hanks) works in an environment where his boss (Dan Hedaya) smothers any humanity, thus clamping down on any human interaction between Joe and DeDe (Meg Ryan). Then, Joe is diagnosed with a brain cloud by a doctor (Robert Stack). He is then approached by a businessman (Lloyd Bridges) who wants Joe to jump into a volcano as a human sacrifice so that the islanders will give Bridges the rights to a very rare mineral for his business. Joe meets the two daughters of Bridges (both also played by Meg Ryan), one who is weird and suicidal, the other of whom is lively and free.But what is key here is that Joe, when not under his brain cloud develops relationships with each of them. Each relationship is unique and begins to teach Joe than the world is not as sterile as his job led him to believe. He even develops a short, but meaningful relationship with a limousine driver (Ossie Davis).And while there is a thread of humor running throughout the story, it's not just a bunch of gags. It's mostly gags based on some aspect of sensitivity.What's interesting here is that this is Tom Hanks before we discovered what a fine dramatic actor he was...and yet, the hints are there is this film through a portrayal sensitively acted. Oddly enough, there's sort of a preview here -- Joe is adrift in the ocean at one point during the story; shades of Cast Away some 10 years later.There's also some funny casting here -- Abe Vigoda as the island chief and Nathan Lane as one of the islanders.As I've indicated, Tom Hanks is quite sensitive in this comedy film. Meg Ryan shows ads flair for humor, and is interesting because she plays 3 characters totally different in their personalities.Now, before you think I've praised this movie too much, I should tell you that once Joe gets to the island, things get a bit silly. Good silly, but still silly. But that's okay...it's a comedy.I maintain this film is more than meets the eye and underrated.

After getting the credit cards, Joe goes back into the real world. I expected more surrealism. After that, the surrealism returns with Meg Ryan playing another character. It makes shopping in Manhattan out of step.The 3 Meg Ryan performances are a little jarring at first. I enjoy DeDe as a little wacky and a little darker than her usual fare. Angelica is not as enjoyable. She seems to be trying to hard with her voice. She should pull back a little with the crazy voice and she could replace Ossie Davis on his shopping trips. Patricia is classic Meg and shows their easy chemistry once again. Overall, this may be uneven at times but there are plenty of interesting imaginative concepts.

The first time I saw it, I didn't like it at all. It wasn't until years later that a co-worker's constant quoting of I know he can get the job, but can he DO the job? combined with finding the DVD in a cut-out bin for $5 prompted me to watch it again.Part of the problem is that the promotional trailer sold the film as a colorful, screwball, romantic comedy. But it starts out looking about a bleak as you'll ever find in a major studio comedy. It's not until a third of the way into the film that Hanks' character starts living his life and color starts seeping into the movie. It's not until nearly two thirds of the way into the film that the main romantic couple finally meet. After that, the movie eventually becomes that colorful screwball comedy that the trailer promised, but by then it had probably lost half its audience.You won't find too many other major Hollywood productions complete with big name actors that come close to the surreal, symbolic fable quality of Joe Verses the Volcano. The movie's moral seems to be that you should really live your life, doing the things you want to do with the people you want to be with. Don't waste your life slaving away at a dead-end job that you don't even like. Of course, that's easy to say when you think you're dying and some multi-billionaire gives you an unlimited credit card in return for jumping into a volcano.Overall, there are enough funny bits and quotable lines to make this movie worth watching, and it might actually make you think a bit and reflect on life in general. Meg Ryan is pretty amazing playing three very different roles, with Patricia at the end of the film being about as adorable as Ryan gets. Tom Hanks on the other hand - to be honest, I've never been a big fan of his, and he seems kind of miscast in this movie. For some reason while I was watching it, I kept thinking that Joe would have been a good role for Dudley Moore.

If one goes into the theater with a particular sort of expectation, that expectation sits and waits to be fulfilled &#x97; if it isn't, the audience member eventually decides that they simply didn't like the movie. It has nothing to do with the film, necessarily it has to do with the thoughts and feelings in the pre-stages of viewership. Take for instance, 1959's Some Like It Hot. The American Film Institute considers it to be the funniest movie ever made. With that knowledge, one expects a film so hilarious that they will be gasping for air even more than they did the first time they saw Airplane. But if the end result isn't asphyxiation, the impression will not be I loved Some Like It Hot &#x97; it will be What did you think of Some Like it Hot?, the response coming in the form of It was good, but not as good as Airplane. Do you see where I'm going with this?When Joe Versus the Volcano came out in 1990, it was a colossal failure; most thought of it as a disaster in Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan's skyrocketing personas, a nail in the career coffin of rising talent John Patrick Shanley, who wrote Norman Jewison's Moonstruck. Audiences didn't much enjoy it, Entertainment Weekly gave it an F, and it lost enough money to put itself in the Hall of Infamy (an awful place that I just made up). Watching Joe Versus the Volcano now, it's apparent that it is not a bomb, rather a movie everyone expected to be a typical Hanks/Ryan romantic comedy and got the film equivalent of your quirky neighbor down the lane. It is such a strange picture that preconceived notions really do have the power to ruin one's judgment &#x97; imagine paying to see something cute and ending up with a Jean-Luc Godard directed, existential art fantasy scripted by Nora Ephron. But as it ages, slowly completing the design of its silver lining as a cult film, Joe Versus the Volcano comes closer to reaching the two most powerful words in the history of movie critiquing hidden &#x97; gasp &#x97; gem. (Those may not be the most powerful but they sure do make a movie sound marvelous.) Joe Banks (Tom Hanks) is so depressed that he may as well star as the before picture in a depression medication ad. An ex-firefighter who has since stepped down into the confines of a soul-sucking office cubicle job, Joe is convinced that the fluorescent lights hanging above him are making him sick and that there is something seriously wrong with his well-being. He goes to the doctor (Robert Stack) and sure enough &#x97; he is diagnosed with a brain cloud, a terminal condition that is rapidly spreading throughout his head. He is given six months to live. Where most would react in a functional Susan Hayward freakout, Joe looks at the prognosis as a new, if extremely temporary, chapter in his life. He quits his job, takes his office crush, DeDe (Meg Ryan) out to dinner, and starts to think for himself.Not long after is he approached by a millionaire, Samuel Graynamore (Lloyd Bridges), who offers a deal. He owns a small island, known as Waponi Woo, and its natives are facing a crisis. According to legend, a sacrifice must be made every 100 years to the island's central volcano &#x97; if not, it will explode, destroying everything in sight. Graynamore, a thinker, figures that Joe would be an ideal sacrifice (what does he have to lose?), offering him unlimited wealth in exchange for a literally life changing jump. Joe agrees without skipping a beat, developing relationships with Graynamore's daughters, Angelica and Patricia (both portrayed by Ryan), along the way.Joe Versus the Volcano is the eccentric you didn't play with during your childhood years, sitting in the corner of the room and zoning out to the pitter-patters of their imagination. With its Dick Tracy meets Pedro Almodóvar set design and baroque scenes of dialogue, there is nothing like it and there probably never will be. It is a romantic comedy, but not of the Sleepless in Seattle caliber. It is almost a fantasy, landing in a bizarre world in which every love interest is played by Ryan (in assorted wigs) and remote islands are inhabited by exotic Jews that only drink orange soda. Most importantly, though, it details characters that feel real (despite the reverie that stalks the camera); Hanks isn't his usual charismatic self, instead a guy whose social skills are just creaky enough to render him as nicely quirky as he is love-sick. All three of Ryan's portrayals offer something vital and zany to the film; the screenplay, and Hanks, are added flavors that mix in attractively to Ryan's dominance. Joe Versus the Volcano is goofy, sure, but it breathes crisp, new air while the other romantic comedies of the 1990s sat around and idled insignificantly. "}{"Title":"Quirky comedy mostly for the stars","Date":"2 May 2015","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" Joe Versus the Volcano is a mixed bag of comedy, romance, fantasy and adventure. The comedy is a little on the dark side initially, but then brings in some outlandish stuff for laughs toward the end, including some hilarious history. One suspects, however, that many modern viewers (i.e., younger) may not catch that. For instance, Patricia (one of three characters that Meg Ryan plays very well) reads the history of Waponi Woo, the fictitious Pacific Island they are sailing toward. It was settled 1,800 years ago after a Roman galley with a crew of druids and Jews was caught in a huge storm off Carthage (in the Mediterranean Sea off North Africa). They were swept a thousand miles off course and wound up on the wrong side of the horn of Africa (in the Indian Ocean). Thinking they were returning to Rome, they sailed deep into the South Pacific and finally ended up colonizing a lightly populated Polynesian Island. No wonder the Waponi's were known to lack a sense of direction. But, as outlandish as the storm is that carried them more than a couple thousand miles away, the crew makeup is even more hilarious. The Romans had just conquered the druid areas of England in the first century, and by the second century, the druids had all but disappeared. While the Bible tells us of the fishermen on the Sea of Galilee, the ancient Jews were not a seafaring nation So, a Roman galley with a crew of druids and Jews would be a truly hilarious fictitious arrangement. Then, as Joe (played by Tom Hanks) and Patricia come ashore, the natives are singing a song to the tune of Hava Nagila. (Let Us Rejoice), a modern Jewish festival song. Patricia concluded reading the background on the island and people, Thus was born the Waponi culture, a mixture of Polynesian, Celtic, Hebrew and Latin influences.The story is quirky and the parts of the plot don't seem to blend together well. The writing is weak and the direction and editing aren't quite in sync. The best thing of the movie is the cast and the performances of all. It's especially a good vehicle for the talents of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. Ryan steals the scenes she is in as DeDe and Angelica, because we know that that's Meg Ryan under the quirky makeup. The movie is fun to watch once, but that's about it.

In order to accurately review this film, it may be necessary to talk about some key moments.--This was an easy movie to want to like. There is plenty unique artistry for it's time to make repeat viewings fresh, and it's a no-brainer to admire it's boldness of design choice and decision to cast Meg Ryan in three separate roles; something few films have successfully done. However, the sad truth is that while Joe Versus the Volcano is not a bad movie, it is far more interesting in it's concept than execution.Joe quits his job after being lead to believe that he has a 'brain cloud' which leaves him with mere months to live. Afterwards he enters into a bizarre business agreement with a wealthy tycoon in which Joe agrees to plummet into a live volcano, which in turns would appease local natives whom inhabit a small island in Hawaii in exchange for a rare material. Joe embarks on a series of short and humorous events leading up to this climactic encounter. Now I found myself finding each event Joe was going through to be so interesting, that each occurrence could've merited a film itself. The limousine driver, his female co- worker, his love interest, her sister the self described 'fliberty jibbet'; all of these characters were too fleeting as no reappearances were to be found after they were conveniently worked off screen thanks to frequent location changes. To the films defense, it was a rare treat to find so many charming and interesting characters in a film of this nature more than the usual annoying and testy ones.This movie is more a part of the less serious and more risk taking Steven Spielberg 'executive producer' era of films along side The Money Pit and Batteries Not Included, which to me are just as defining of their time period as their peers. However, Joe came out in 1990, and apparently still reeling from the last decade since it feels overwhelmingly like an 80s movie, something that saw a quick death at the hands of the 'Reality Bites' time period that was rapidly approaching. So it can be felt in the heart of this film that it wasn't of any benefit that it was released when it was, and even thinking of it as a nostalgic slice of the 80s, seeing as it was most likely filmed during part of 89', helped (at least for me) to enhance the quality of it's wacky and surreal approach during viewing. By the end though, the movie felt like it had just started, and its brief 100 min run time didn't aid it's cause. On the upside, this movie had little to no filler because of it, and it's writing is far better than it is worse even at it's most kooky. The almost a Monty-Python like dry and zanny world being portrayed, but all that aside, it's way too short and feels like it's existence was a forced out as a last entry into a dead decade of film style. Maybe that's just me, but Joe Versus the Volcano feels like a product of bad timing and poor movie practices that saw it's potential left with just enough personality to keep it around today; even if teetering on the brink of being forgotten; rather than a fully realized artistic comedy classic.

However, for fans of the film, it is just those elements that define the experience - the fairytale mood, the obviously fake shark, a huge moon, the strangest luggage shop and subtly placed over-sized dogs.From an artistic perspective, some of the sets, as low-budget as they may have been, were absolutely brilliant - could the office have been more miserable - the perfect environment in which to triumphantly put your boss in his place.In a way Joe versus the Volcano reminds you of when you were a kid reading your favorite story about a voyage or adventure - your imagination was half the experience. When you were a kid you noticed things like big dogs. This movie is about Joe's waking up and returning to that mindset of absorbing the wonderful things that surround you, sharing experiences with others and, 'living in constant amazement'.

The same goes for Ryan and her characters, and for the 'chemistry / romance' between the leads.

That hope diminishes by the minute when Joe gets to go shopping with a big wallet and subsequently gets into all kinds of incoherent boredom along the way. And no, there is no fight between Joe and the volcano...I can appreciate the fact that director Joe Dante wanted to put in some sarcastic observations on some mind-numbing aspects of industrial society that are finally overcome by hope and a sense of life around us, maybe even on the field of medicine / psychiatry, but it's still a straight up flop for the greater part.

Joe, played by Tom Hanks, is a hypochondriac who's diagnosed with a life threatening 'Brain Cloud' and is only left with a short time to live. Immediately after this discovery he is approached with the request to sacrifice himself by jumping into a Volcano in order to help a businessman retain the rights to a rare mining operation on a tropical island.  In return for this, Joe is given the opportunity to live out his final days in a very grand fashion.  However, during preparation for the journey, and the travel itself Joe goes through some highly enlightening of self-discovery as he is helped along by his newly appointed chauffer and a few incarnations of Meg Ryan.My take on the movie...This is not necessarily for those who fell in love with 'Sleepless in Seattle'.  The original screenplay was written in a very dark and cynical (but somehow still very uplifting) way; however the movie was shot in a little brighter light.  For anyone who is seeking a meaning to their existence or for those who have found it; this is an extremely wonderful movie.  It may take several replays to catch all of the humor and insight that this movie has to offer.  Some of the humor in the movie is IMO the best Tom Hanks has ever done.  It seems to be growing in cult status; which only insures that it may never be the mainstream hit that I feel it deserves to be.  To sum things up, this is the typical movie that most everyone will consider to be one of the best or worst movies they have ever seen.Favorite seen...Would most likely be when Joe is finally given the opportunity to quit his job after the discovery of his fatal illness.  Off course this could be due to my personal history of horrible jobs and how I would have liked to done the same things.  I don't think that any other movie would ever feature a Hollywood superstar wailing a prosthetic arm around, knocking a pair of prosthetic testicles off of their boss's desk.

I was too young to get any of it. Besides, how serious can you get about any film when you're 12-years-old and worrying about making a move on that nervous girl with the sweaty palm you've been holding halfway into the picture.Seeing it again as an adult, it has become one of my all time favorite movies. In the vein of the cult and underrated comedies of the past (1941, Pee-Wee's Big Adventure), Joe has been slain by audiences who expect to see something else, and hate to be surprised.I have no sympathy for people who hate surprises so much it ruins their experiences at the movies. The people who really hate movies like Joe need to lighten up. Take a vacation to Waponi-Woo or something. Drink some orange soda. And quick!This movie is clever, and yet doesn't take itself too seriously. It has moments of romantic, thought-provoking dialogue with wonderful supporting actors (Meg RyanX3 and Ossie Davis as the limo driver), awesome cartoonish production design by Bo Welch of Beetlejuice fame, and of course great music (both original scoring by the writer-director Shanley and a treasure chest of choice golden oldies).JVTV has Meg Ryan starring in three different roles which--by the film's end--brings a kind of poignancy to the cliche bar come-on line by Tom Hank's Joe to Ryan's characters Did I ever tell you that the first time I met you, I felt like I'd seen you before?This movie has an obvious message but it doesn't kill the fun along the way. This is a fairytale for adults. When compared to the recent efforts of the `Carpe Diem' message-movie (Zemeckis' Cast Away), it surpasses with wit and subtlety. JVTV brings a serious message to the screen but doesn't make you swallow it whole. Cast Away and so many others feel as subtle as a sledgehammer and almost painfully laughable when they take themselves too seriously to get the same point across.This movie is a test to see if there's anything romantic and passionate left in your too serious grown-up body.If you pass the test, you'll love this movie for what it is a unique, imperfect fable that went over a lot of cynical heads.

And for that reason, if none other, we must all watch it.Joe is a guy like you and me, except that he is a movie character and a bit exaggerated. He lives a mundane tubelit existence, doing the dullest job in the universe, surrounded by nothing but shadows, in a place where nothing ever happens. And then something happens that sends him off on an unreal, surrealistic adventure that teaches him a thing or two about life. And death.On the one hand this film is about some pretty big subjects the meaning of life, taking chances, love, passion, fun, adventure, and all those things we of the great middle class only dream of, or occasionally enjoy, on paid for, organised trips 'around the world'.But on the other hand it is about nothing at all. The narrative itself is an adventure, about taking off into the unknown (even if the reason is not entirely one's own choice). However, the story choices are at some level all very arbitrary and the plot if you examine it is very linear and minimal. The point is that the film's content/events are so absurd, random and arbitrary, that the film seems to be revelling in the arbitrariness of nature itself. In the process, it is more about randomness and what they call 'hazard', rather than the actual events themselves. And it is hence about nothing at all.Frank Zappa's music has that quality, it seems to get up and walk around just because it wants to, because it is free, and in doing so Zappa has for me always asserted the right to the freedom of expression, the freedom to 'be'. Joe Versus is not in the same league as ole Frank, but it does walk around in the same area.It is in a sense a movie about the imagination - about the right to imagine, and in that sense it is perhaps, a movie about the movie making process. The character in a sense is imagining his life, living in a dream - and the movie is doing the same.Stylistically though, the director 'indulges' himself with several scoops of 'exaggeration' - the dull office environment, Meg Ryan's character, the big suitcase, the plot line itself, and the entire treatment of the film. Joe Versus treats its subject matter very lightly. It is, genre-wise, a comedy, and it stays true to the genre all through. And like many comedies it is about the moment, the gag, the expression, the little trick - Enjoy.Tom Hanks as is often the case with him, is cast as 'himself' - the nice guy who is wandering around in this magical world amazed at its goings on. In that sense he is perfect. Meg Ryan is adorable and surprisingly witty in some parts - watch out for when she introduces herself saying Hi, I am a flibbertigibbet. Just one thing though. At times, one can't help wondering how this film would have fared in the hands of someone like the Coen brothers. Cinematic ally, the film does seem occasionally to be short on ideas, and one wishes there was more exaggeration, more fun, more style. But all the same it is a must see.

But with those islands, I still like to lump 'em with Hawaii. In my mind, Joe Versus the Volcano has been lumped with Turner and Hooch (1989) and Sleepless in Seattle (1993);pretty much the Tom Hanks movies that bridge his mainly comedic work of the '80s to his more serious roles of the '90s.And so, what do I think about a unique film like Joe Versus the Volcano. Well, I'll start by saying it is a pretty unique film, a rare example of early '90s American expressionism. It looks like no other Tom Hanks film I have ever seen, including Forest Gump (1994) and Cast Away (2000) and its plot is also singularly odd in the Tom Hanks filmography, including Splash (1984) and The Man with One Red Shoe (1985). Joe (Tom Hanks) is an Advertising Librarian for a medical supplies company in New York. His office is a hellish place that makes the bathroom setting in Saw (2004) look like a spa at club med. It is an office filled with flickering florescent lights and a man who endlessly repeats the same phrases again and again. One day Joe feels sickly and decides to go to the doctor who promptly informs him he has a brain cloud. As to what a brain cloud is exactly, we never find out, but we are informed it will kill Joe within six months. The next morning a spastic businessman, Samuel Graynamore (played hilariously by Lloyd Bridges) comes knocking at Joe's door. He has a proposition for Joe. There's a little known volcanic island in the pacific that has a special element Graynamore needs to make superconductors. The tribe on the island will allow Graynamore to take as much of the element as he pleases if he can find them a willing participant to jump into the island's volcano to appease the volcano gods. Graynamore believes Joe is his man and Joe, seeing he has nothing to lose, agrees to do it. The majority of the film follows Joe as he travels to the island. He buys a new wardrobe of clothes, hires limousines and travels luxuriously by air and by sea, all on Graynamore's dime. Along the way Joe meets Graynamore's daughters Angelica and Patricia (both played by Meg Ryan) and learns the value of truly living. I appreciated some parts of this movie very much. For instance, a scene in which Joe beholds a giant moon at sea and begins to pray is very powerful. But on the whole, Joe Versus the Volcano is uneven. If writer-director John Patrick Shanley had presented a more consistent vision I would have liked this film a better. The surrealistic edge to Joe is great, but too often it flips over into scenes that look realistic and lack stylization. It makes for a choppy film going experience.I also wasn't impressed by the romance between Joe and Patricia. It seems to me the sister Angelica was frivolous to the plot and Patricia, who becomes Joe's love interest, could have easily subsumed her role. When Patricia confesses her love to Joe it seems rushed and undeveloped. I didn't buy it. Joes Versus the Volcano is ultimately an oddity and if you're a Tom Hanks fan its worth checking out. But when I consider what this film is versus what it could have been, I wish what it could have been had won. RatingOn a scale of one to Casablanca, this film is a Superman Returns (2006)RationalizationWhat it is versus what it could have been says it all. I really wanted Superman Returns to be awesome, but let's face it, Superman Returns is a disappointment. If you give Lois Lane a husband and a kid, you really can't root for Superman to get the girl in the end without also making him into a super-dick. And no hand to hand face-off with Lex Luthor? That's just a shame. There's one scene where Luthor's goons kick the crap out of Superman and that sets up tension that should have been released by Superman's vengeance. But no. No vengeance. Apparently it didn't get personal for Superman even though it was clearly personal. Some people would say superman is not a vengeful creature, but he is. Remember in the Max Fleischer cartoons how Superman could just pick up a villain and throw him in jail without due process? In my mind, that is real vengeance and real power. But no. In Superman Returns he just chose to be boring.

Before winning his academy award for Philadelphia, Tom Hanks described himself as a lonely, lonely guy.  He obviously meant movies like this as his reason why.  Joe Versus the Volcano is a ridiculous, unfunny comedy that's utterly predictable and completely corny.  It is a movie that should have been cute and charming but misses the mark badly.  Never before have Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks been given such drivel to work with, and that's saying something for all the bad movies Hanks was subjected to in the 1980's.  The plot is about Hanks being diagnosed with a brain cloud and given six months to live.  He's propositioned by Lloyd Bridges to go out in style by throwing himself into a volcano on a tropical island in order to appease some spirits or some such nonsense.  No one really seems to care, especially the island chief played by Abe Vigoda who acts like, well, Abe Vigoda.  Meg Ryan falls in love with Hanks' character, mostly because she's a crazy neurotic and not for anything Hanks has done.  I'll try not to spoil the plot other then saying that just about every plot point and moment in general after Hanks and Ryan throw themselves into the volcano are as inane, predictable and stupid as you can get.  The ocean background shots are also some of the most obviously fake studio shots I've ever seen and the effects are very less then special.  This movie was bad, bad, bad and that's a shame because it could have been very charming.2.5/10   "},{"Title":"Smart and dumb","Date":"11 August 2001","Score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  Very smart idea for this movie in it's spiritual attempts to connect with the audience and at times it succeeds although too much uncalled for zaniness destroys whatever connecton is made.The director should have looked for a more sophisticated style of humor for this movie to flow better with.Philosophical value is there, but orange soda drinking cartoon Polynesians?Dumb.Still a fair effort for most fans of Hanks and Ryan......

I admit that I did laugh at a few things throughout Joe Versus the Volcano, such as some wisecracks made by some characters and the boss's constant repetitions of the same things on the phone in the office at the beginning. I admit the film felt romantic for a minute before Joe (Tom Hanks) was about to jump into the volcano. Also, the film has a good concept in terms of Joe learning he is going to die and deciding to live the rest of his life to the fullest and also deciding to die like a man. Nevertheless, I couldn't completely enjoy this film mostly due to it's overly bizarre nature. Most characters do not seem as though they are really into their roles. Half the time, Tom Hanks seems to be feeling too sorry for himself and just comes off as boring to the audience. Also, I ordinarily love Meg Ryan, but none of her three characters in this film appeal to me. She is best at playing a simple, ordinary person with feelings that we can care for, and here she just comes off as annoying in the ways she plays her roles. All in all, not one of the worst films I've seen, but rarely am I torn this much in terms of how to rate a movie.

After he goes to a new doctor he is diagnosed with a terminal illness called a brain cloud. Joe goes on living but knows he'll die in a few months when he is confronted by a man with an incredible offer. Samuel Harvey Graynamore (Lloyd Bridges) offers Joe the once in a lifetime offer. He'll receive an expense paid trip. A first-class flight to LA, a cruise and than spend a few nights on an island. But there's a catch, Joe has to jump in a volcano to preserve an ancient custom of the natives performed once a century. Seeing that he'll die anyway he does it and gets new clothes, new luggage and than flies to LA. In LA he meets one of Sam's daughters, a troubled artist named Angelica (Meg Ryna). She takes him to his 'luxury liner', a small boat captained by Sam's other daughter, Patricia (Meg Ryan). At sea Joe is nearly bitten by a shark, becomes sea-sick and soon finds himself floating adrift with Patricia on his expensive luggage. The film takes an awkward turn with the natives of the island. I hoped for a little more from this film but didn't get it. hanks proves to have a comedy side in this and Meg Ryan is just funny seeing her play three different characters. The plot is actually a little complex and silly and I wouldn't give any awards to the special effects manager. Terminal illness is not something that should be used in comedy films and this is the only movie I've seen that used it that way.

I'm afraid I might have fallen asleep, but I'm more afraid that I might have been awake and only *thought* I was asleep. Philosophy, I can appreciate; quirky, I can appreciate &#150; add romance to the mix and skew everything with irrationality over repressing bodily fluids.Long before Cast Away, Hanks here finds himself adrift on an endless ocean with nothing but a mindless entity for companionship &#150; Meg Ryan.(Movie Maniacs, visit www.poffysmoviemania.com) "},{"Title":"Takes forever to get interesting, and the waiting period is hell to sit through","Date":"23 April 2000","Score":"1 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  	I'm not really sure how anyone could enjoy this movie. Up to the climax, it's extremely tedious, boring and never funny. What takes an hour and a half to transpire could've taken twenty minutes, and it gets annoying finding out which Meg Ryan character Tom Hanks' Joe is currently with. The movie demands a huge amount of concentration dedicated to it, which you just don't want to give out, as it is not very well done or the least bit enjoyable. For whatever reason it was well received, as all major aspects of it, particularly the special effects, are very weak. Why a major studio would decide to distribute it, no one knows.	The only bright spot here is the terrific chemistry between Hanks and Ryan (that's probably why there were two other films made with them in the leads), but of the three movies with them together, 'Joe Versus the Volcano' is easily the worst one. It takes a terribly long time to get to the point, and when it does, it's over in a couple of minutes. Rent it only if you're desperate for something with the two together, otherwise avoid like the plague. If you skip this advice, I can almost completely guarantee that you'll be disappointed, I know I was. Skip it and watch 'Sleepless in Seattle' or 'You've Got Mail' again.3/10 "},{"Title":"Hanks' and Ryan's talent shines through dismal plot","Date":"25 June 2001","Score":"2 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  The main lesson I learned from Joe Versus the Volcano is that highly talented people can make some pretty bad movies.  Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan do their best, which is considerable, to put some life into a plot that reminds me of a high school skit (or maybe Saturday Night Live!)  There's no character development, and most of the situations are not funny, or even believable.  Except for the joy of watching Hanks and Ryan together, this is one to miss.

Much to my surprise, most of the reviews aren't just good they are glowing. And, no, I don't understand why.The film cries Straight To Video! It is off-beat and quirky without ever really feeling like an auteur movie. Themeatically, it is simply one of those hokey American fairy tales about the little guy triumphing in the face of adversity. A Cinderella man. Schmaltz by any other name.The leads perform their job adequately, the production values are fine and it is not without integrity but it still doesn't add up to a satisfactory movie. I suspect it's down to Spielberg's involvement. It's just too saccharine to be palatable.

Tom Hanks plays a man diagnosed with a rare brain disease that will kill him within days (or was it weeks?). Meg Ryan plays two parts that I won't get into soley because it is not that important to what I am telling you of the movie. Basically, the great parts of this dark comedy are the first forty-five to sixty minutes, where Tom Hanks' office area is explored and recorded amazingly. The dark atmosphere is excellent. Then, the whole shopping-spree thing is very nice. But once they get to the boat, I turn off the film, because the rest of it is very stupid and boring. So, basically, watch this movie, but just turn it off once they leave their homeland.3/5 stars -John Ulmer "}{"Title":"disappointing","Date":"8 April 2002","Score":"1 out of 12 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  I was extremely disappointed with this movie - I have been watching trailers for it since it first came out, but I never got a chance to see it until last year.  I was disappointed by the length of the dark dismal part of it - it just dragged on and on!  The trailers showed only the scenes on the island, therefore I was expecting it to be upbeat and lighthearted.  I came away from it feeling depressed, I felt like the ending was far too abrupt. The only part I enjoyed was the fact that Meg Ryan played 3 different characters, all of which she did an excellent job of (my favorite was the flibbertyjibbet).

As many other user comments suggest, the masses do not readily accept this film as being on par with the blockbuster system that governs movie grading.It is important to realize that Joe versus the Volcano was written and directed by a playwright and so, if you don't like it when your movie looks a little cheezy and the effects aren't state-of-the-art cgi quality, we get it - you hate it. However, for fans of the film, it is just those elements that define the experience - the fairytale mood, the obviously fake shark, a huge moon, the strangest luggage shop and subtly placed over-sized dogs.From an artistic perspective, some of the sets, as low-budget as they may have been, were absolutely brilliant - could the office have been more miserable - the perfect environment in which to triumphantly put your boss in his place.In a way Joe versus the Volcano reminds you of when you were a kid reading your favorite story about a voyage or adventure - your imagination was half the experience. When you were a kid you noticed things like big dogs. This movie is about Joe's waking up and returning to that mindset of absorbing the wonderful things that surround you, sharing experiences with others and, 'living in constant amazement'.

Anyone giving it more than 2 stars must be their friends and relatives. It is the most depressing, boring, predictable movie we could imagine. The first part is just depressing and sad and makes you wish you were somewhere else and the end is just fake and predictable and hokey and makes you long for a real movie. I haven't checked the dates to see if it was the first movie they made, but we just assumed they took this when nothing else was available. If you like Meg Ryan then try ANY OTHER movie she made but not this one. We wanted to shut if off early but it was late and we didn't have any other movies rented so we suffered through the whole sad thing.... I don't really have any more to say about how bad this was but they say a review must be 10 lines so I'll just add this it is really, REALLY bad, REALLY.

The complete mistake the director made is from the first second explicit. I think he wanted to make an art-movie, but looked for a compromise between art and money. Now it's neither art nor a blockbluster. I had a very bad evening. The average vote of 6.2 amazed me. Yargh!

Even after all this time it rates as the worst ever film that I have paid to see (the Day After Tomorrow was at least funny bad - for example where do you get those yellow tents that can protect you against the cold when nothing else can?!) and possibly the worst film I have ever seen. Quirky can only be used as a description if you were either drunk or on drugs - it was TERRIBLE. There is a reason that no one talks about it. If I could have given this 0 I would have done.
