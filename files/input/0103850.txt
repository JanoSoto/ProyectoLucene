[{"Title":"Don't Miss the Point; This is Satire, not Commentary","Date":"29 February 2004","Score":"56 out of 75 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  The focus of most of these comments has been on the film's perceived political commentary on American politics.Let's make one thing clear This film is a satire, not a commentary; in my opinion it's not about Republicans or Democrats, or conservatives or liberals; it is about the nature of democracies.The point that the film, Bob Roberts, makes can be summed up very clearly. Here is the nature of democracies Voters choose winners over losers, champions over whiners, statements of power over statements of sacrifice. The list goes on; people prefer form over function, youth over age, presentation/entertainment over substance.This film does transcend political lines; but in it's context, lets take a look at the specifics.  Bob Roberts is electable because his message is just vague and occluded enough by his presentation, that he seems likeable. His message is not unique or original; he speaks to the elements that have always appealed to the more right-wing or fascistic elements of society; marginalization of the weak (in this case, the poor), empowerment of the common man, family values, etc.Roberts' opponent, Paiste, is a textbook liberal; but this contest is not about left vs. right.  Paiste is an educated man, and a career politician. He acknowledges the challenges in the American economy.  He actually has answers to the issues; whether they are politically favorable or not is not significant.  Roberts, on the other hand, says nothing about the real issues; he appeals only to the emotions of the mob, and because he uses the medium of folk music, he offends the sensibilities of liberals (both in the movie, and in its audience), because he uses the authenticity of the 60's and its messages of change, and perverts them to express his messages of reactionism and exclusion.And it works.Tim Robbins has a winner here, and this film gets overlooked because it gets dragged into these conversations about Robbins' own political views, and whether the film is making a statement about Republicans or Democrats. But Robbins says something far more universal with this film; democracies are not safe from tyranny or fascism; all it takes is a charismatic reactionary who can manipulate the interests of the press and the political interests to rise to power by appealing to the worst elements of our psyche, for entertainment, glamour, and exclusionism.  Please remember that Hitler came to power by appealing to the worst aspects of the people of his nation, and was quite successful in creating much evil from that.  Being part of a free nation comes with a huge responsibility; to carefully consider who we elect and what we value, and to allow those debates to have meaning.  Bob Roberts shows us how easily we can neglect that responsibility, and how easily voters can be sold an offensive, exclusionary message, when it is wrapped up in something more attractive than what's real.

The story shows how an evil man can utilize right wing themes and hot button issues to gain real power and influence the direction of this country. Robbins is great as the right wing, folk singer, businessman, racist, Senatorial candidate that is hoping to be Pennsylvania's voice in Washington. The sad thing is, as you watch the film, you see how easy it is for this horrible man to manipulate the media into getting him elected. By using good looks and off hand remarks candidates are able to steer elections in the direction they want them to go. Meanwhile, honesty takes a back seat to how well a candidate can croon a song. Truth trails behind what the media might be able to use as entertainment. The media is dazzled by fluff and sound bites, they turn a deaf ear to real issues. When I saw this film the first time, I was very uncomfortable. The film was too close to reality. Bob Roberts is a Joe McCarthy/Rush Limbaugh for the 1990's. Although they might seem harmless on the surface, they do pose real danger. This movie is important and should be seen by all voters. It tries to teach people to look at the facts and the real issues and put the fluff aside. Ahh, if only that could be done.

Bob Roberts was a 1992 'mock-umentry' about the election of a Republican know-nothing (the title character) to a U.S. Senate seat in Pennsylvania; in the movie Roberts wins against a too-brainy-to win Democrat played by Gore Vidal.  The real 1994 U.S. Senate race in Pennsylvania featured Rick Santorum as the Republican candidate. Santorum not only had the same aggressively anti-intellectual outlook as Roberts (I understand his staff is afraid to leave him alone with the press lest he 'throw a brick'), he even used generous helpings of Roberts' faux-revolutionary rhetoric to claim that his election would be an empowerment of the common people of Pennsylvania against a murkily-described 'elite'.   In fact, Santorum, like Roberts, was a front man for an economic interest - to wit, the health insurance industry - who bankrolled 95% of his lavish campaign and which was eager to replace his rival, Harris Wolford, who was an advocate for universal health coverage.   Like the Vidal character, Wolford was disadvantaged by being a genuinely concerned person whose detailed worldview found it hard to stand effectively against the style of Santorum/Roberts.

It is filmed in documentary style, telling the story of Bob Roberts, the conservative son of hippie parents who is running for the U.S. Senate seat from Pennsylvania. His message is conveyed through a series of folk songs. His albums and videos are reminiscent of Bob Dylan (The Freewheelin' Bob Roberts), but his songs have titles like Drugs Stink and This Land Was Made For Me and lyrics like what's right is right, what's left is wrong. It's funny to see the very liberal Robbins play a character like this. The songs, written by Robbins and his brother David, are very witty and biting and get his point across beautifully. Bob pulls a crazy stunt near the end to try to sway voters in his direction which I'm surprised no real politician has done. James Spader does an absolute perfect parody of a news anchor. A very funny movie, particularly the songs Robbins sings. Brilliant satire. The final shot in this movie, like the one in Robbins' Cradle Will Rock, is very powerful.

The real sting in this film is that, devious and repulsive as Bob Roberts is, he is far more charismatic and interesting than his tired rival, Brickley Paiste (Gore Vidal), and he has managed to appropriate all of the weapons of the 1960s protest movements (including that most sacred insitution of all, folk music) and use them with a vigour that is scarily convincing. Roberts has the adulation of young men and women (watch for a young Jack Black as a smitten fan), the power of the record industry, and access to concerts halls and media coverage to get his message across. What does the left have? A rabid underground journalist (Bugs Raplin), a goofy Saturday Night Live-type show (Cutting Edge Live) that may once have been edgy, but now just seems silly (even Roberts himself is a fan), a tired old senator droning on about social programs (Paiste), and a few strident voices crying in the wilderness, (including the journalist played by Lynne Thigpen). Roberts has replaced Bob Dylan as the voice of his generation (Robbins includes a hilarious riff on Dylan's Subterranean Homesick Blues video from Don't Look Back). Robbins' real target here is how the ideals of the 60s have failed miserably, how times have changed back, and how greed, self-interest and intolerance have become the new order of the 1990s (and continue today). Roberts is *not* George Bush (senior or junior)--he's a much more frightening animal who shows up just how the voices of dissent have dwindled into insignificance.

He's that kind of a guy, the kind that can sweep you off your feet, rally the crowds into a frenzy and have them eating out of his hand. He's the Perfect Politician, and that's why he's going to win... even if it takes a little manipulation here and there and maybe even some slight legerdemain. But you don't have to know that. All you have to know is that he's the guy with that open smile, he's the guy who can sing a folk song, he's the Poster Boy for the American Dream, the one who can make this country a Country and make us proud to be an American citizen. He's the man you'll see on every news channel -- Headline News, Fox News, CNN, MSNBC -- and he'll make you feel good about yourself. He'll talk about promise, he'll embrace the people, and the people will love him, because he's their Hero.This is one sharp tack of a movie, and one that every thinking person should sit on and feel the prick and maybe even see a drop of blood come out like a red flag. Tim Robbins is the new Orson Welles in the fact that he's able to direct, write, and star in his movie about corruption in the political arena. With this movie he's made his own little moving picture that depicts what we see on a daily basis once election times comes sway -- candidate against candidate, using the worst possible tactics to make the other seem unworthy of a vote, always promising to make things better, improve the status of life, and making sure they look as primped and handsome and camera friendly as humanly possible, because it's a known fact that handsome men gain more votes than men who look like Ebenezer Scrooge.And Robbins has those oddly engaging looks of his that make him the ideal person to cast in the role of the politician that is swaying the masses to his will in Pennsylvania. His is the face that looks angelic in many ways, but one that holds a little menace just under the surface. Maybe it's the coldness of his eyes, but when he plays characters like this he seems like he could slap you blind without a second's notice and immediately resume his camera-ready smile in no time. And how many politicians don't already look like him? I'd like to know. Bob Roberts is a summation of all of the wanna-be governors and presidents that we've seen display their talent for jab. We all want to follow someone, which is why the movie becomes this monster towards the end, and in one short scene Jack Black all but goes bonkers in his support for Roberts. That's the reality of the political game, and just another part of who we are as Americans.

The only rational perspective comes from the British documentary reporter, who views our political system with dry distaste.  Was Tim Robbins making the statement that all Americans are crazy, including American filmmakers, and that only Europeans can be rational?  If so, I strongly disagree (see Exhibits WWI and II)The other disappointment for me was the downward spiral of song quality as the movie progresses.  Drugs stink?

He's a movie star. He's smug, self-righteous, arrogant, self-pitying, and rich. He's married to Susan Sarandon, the most gorgeous and vibrant mature woman imaginable. He has so much, yet consistently strikes the pose of a martyr. I tuned into this movie prepared to hate it, but came away very impressed. Whatever his flaws as a citizen or a political thinker, Tim Robbins is a gifted film maker. The musical numbers are hysterical, and the documentary style comedy is the best since SPINAL TAP. The movie keeps moving at a suspenseful pace, and the chilling ending is surprisingly convincing, understated rather than too melodramatic.Now there are some flaws to this movie that I think merit discussion. Tim Robbins hates the Bob Roberts character he plays, hates him with a passion. Yet he strikes several false notes. Some reviewers would deny this, but Bob Roberts is clearly supposed to be an evil Republican populist like Ronald Reagan or George W. Bush. And that's fine. But Robbins gets into trouble by making Roberts too much like . . . well, like Tim Robbins.Bob Roberts is a too hip. He's a Hollywood hipster. He digs folk music, adores Bob Dylan, and is entirely too cerebral and too in love with the flash and glamor of MTV type videos. Tim Robbins misses the essence of how conservatives market themselves, how they tap into (and genuinely share) the loathing the white working class feels for intellectuals and artists. Bob Roberts minces around in a white fencing suit, fencing with his campaign manager, like a proud Prussian prince. Fencing! When George W. Bush was at Andover, he named himself high commissioner of stickball. He knew even then that fencing was worse than polo. Tim Robbins misses the point about what cultural populism really means.On a deeper level, this movie wants to leave you in a cold sweat, like Frankenheimer's 1962 version of THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE. And it succeeds, to a degree. But these characters are all surface, with no depth. Bob Roberts is as cold and reptilian as Raymond Shaw, but the problem is that his evils are all political, not personal. You don't see more than a second or two of Roberts' parents and early life. You certainly don't see a maniacal mother figure like Angela Lansbury in THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE. There's not a hint of connection between the inner, emotional, or sexual lives of these characters and their extreme political convictions. Bob Roberts has a wife, a blonde who hangs on his arm and smiles adoringly, but we see nothing else. Married to a woman as formidable as Susan Sarandon, Tim Robbins must know much more than this about marriage. But he doesn't accept the challenge. As a result Bob Roberts is a political cartoon rather than a person. And therefore the movie is chilling, but ultimately not as profound or tragic as older political films like THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE.

There are some hints that he may be a pawn, and there are some hints that he may be playing a pawn.  Wheels within wheels.I also like the fact that they didn't take the easy route and make him into some kind of neo-Nazi.  Yes, there was the guy with the intense eyes and Bob written on his forehead, but Bob was given a broader appeal and a message that sounded (on the surface) very positive.Also subtle was the depiction of the media.  When Bob's competitor (Paiste, played wonderfully by Gore Vidal) loses ground in the polls, the media keeps dragging up the accusations, even after it's no longer news and has been fully  debunked.  We wonder  are they pandering?  Is somebody telling them what to say?  Or are they just incapable of reporting news competently?  The movie leaves it to us to decide.Another subtlety crops up when Bob falls off the motorcycle.  Without writing a spoiler, I'll just say that we briefly (and not blatantly) see evidence that his free spirit on a motorcycle image was carefully designed and managed.  (If it's not clear what I'm referring to, I'll just say the other white suit.)  The same level of subtlety occurs when one of his campaign workers leaves by mutual agreement.  It's not completely clear what her mistake was, but the stage-managing of the whole event (e.g. the Dom Perignon comment) is quite enough to make the underlying point that she wasn't sufficiently committed (or bamboozled) for whatever the heck was really going on.I expect that if I saw this film a third time I'd see even more little tidbits like those.Incidentally, I watched this movie with my jaw permanently dropped.

By taking swipes at two-faced politicians and the grinning-idiot members of the mainstream media who cover them, Robbins managed to make his left-wing cause with humour. Although this film is a comedy, it's not often laugh-out-loud funny, but it's actually quite balanced politically. I never felt this was turning into a polemic because ANY politician who runs a dishonest campaign---no matter which wing they represent---will feel the sting of this mockumentary.As the title character, Robbins plays a right-wing senatorial candidate in Pennsylvania who badmouths the revolution of the '60s while prostituting '60s images and reworking old folk songs to sell his corrupt message. It's quite amusing to hear an outspoken actor play a guy who's such a polar opposite. Roberts has it in for drug users, the homeless, the unemployed, and any other group who aren't in the upper class. While the documentary filmmakers shoot all sorts of footage that can help the candidate look great, they also manage to get many shots of the Roberts team at their worst. To be honest, it might have been even more effective if Robbins didn't paint this man as the sleaze he really is. Letting the hateful folk songs (which are performed with great cheer) and the money-hungry message speak for themselves might indeed have been more powerful. Scenes of dissension and anger in the Roberts camp almost undermine what the film is trying to do.As an actor, Tim Robbins has been in an equal mix of drama and comedy. It's interesting that the rookie director would follow this sly satire with the dead-serious 'Dead Man Walking'. It shows his range that he could be funny here while also expressing strong views, then dial it down for stark pathos while still expressing strong views in 'Dead Man Walking'. In these two films and in 'Cradle Will Rock', he uses his friends and stock company of familiar names (including wife Susan Sarandon, Jack Black, John Cusack, Bob Balaban, and several family members).If 'This Is Spinal Tap', 'Best In Show', and 'Real Life' are among the best mockumentaries, 'Bob Roberts' is just a notch below. It doesn't have a particularly strong ending and the entire assassination subplot plays out as way too obvious.

If you have convinced yourself that every Republican is somebody who (like Bob Roberts) makes David Duke look like a centrist, then nothing in this film will challenge your preconceptions.But the weakness of this movie isn't really why I'm commenting on it. What is interesting is comparing it with Dead Man Walking, which is an infinitely superior film that also touches on political debate.  That movie is great exactly because Tim Robbins showed good, likable people on both sides of an issue.  He dealt with the death penalty by letting us feel the honest emotions of everybody rather than trying to paint one group as inherently evil and one as inherently good.This movie is worth a look only to witness the maturation of a filmmaker.

It's not so much a veiled attack on the American right-wing as it is an all singing, all dancing celluloid spit in the Republican party's face. It's also as paranoid as a junkie, and almost proudly one sided, which might be why it has slipped into relative obscurity - it's a film that could be very easily dismissed as a piece of left-wing propaganda, directed by and starring Tim Robbins, an outspokenly leftist actor.But, Bob Roberts is a film that deserves a lot more attention than it receives, largely because unlike a lot of political comedies, it's actually funny. Bob Roberts is a mockumentary about a right wing politician/folk singer named (unsurprisingly) Bob Roberts. Roberts is a kind of anti Bob Dylan, whose modus operandi is to emulate the spirit of the folk singing radicals and then deliberately turn their message on its head - he sings songs about enforcing the death penalty on drug dealers, and the positives of investing in the stock market. Dylan provides such an obvious touchstone for the character that it's arguable the whole film is as much a spoof of the Dylan documentary Don't Look Back as it is a political satire. ﻿ The songs are a good example of what makes this film work. Sure, they're unashamedly political and barbed - they're the kind of spoofs that you'll now find dime a dozen on youtube - but they are so painfully earnest and straightfaced that they're kind of hypnotic. In Bob Roberts, Robbins has created a character who absolutely believes the terrible and terrifying things he sings about, and he plays the part with a wide eyed enthusiasm that makes you laugh, but in that oh so unsettling I'm genuinely disturbed by this kind of way. ﻿ The jokes are totally underplayed, save for an out of place 'before they were famous' Jack Black cameo appearance. He's the only actor who inhabits his role as if it's meant to be funny, all but giving the audience a big fourth wall breaking wink. Everyone else, however, lets the humour come naturally from the insanity of what they're saying they don't gurn to the camera. From Alan Rickman's performance as the shadowy Big Business agent to Gore Vidal as Bob Roberts' running mate, the rest of the cast play the thing totally straight-faced.Sure, the movie's pretty preachy, but it never becomes boring at a lean 102 minutes, it's a freight train of a film, spitting out characters, situations, and genuinely thrilling plot twists.Best of all is the film's ending, which is as cutting as the punchline to a sick joke. There's no messing around to this one. The conclusion socks you in the guts then carries on its way, whistling Bob Roberts' Drugs Stink as it goes.

Echoing D.A. Pennebaker's 1966 documentary Don't Look Back (which covered Bob Dylan's 1965 U.K. tour; a number of scenes in Bob Roberts are cribbed directly from the Pennebaker film), Bob Roberts follows the title character (played by Robbins, who also directs and writes here) in his 1990 Senatorial campaign against Brickley Paiste, a once-vigorous, but now-weary and increasingly disenchanted New Frontier-era liberal democrat (played by author Gore Vidal). Roberts, who had made a fortune on Wall Street during the '80s, first gains national attention in the late '80s with a pair of critically panned, but commercially successful albums (clever homages to two early '60s Dylan albums) of right-wing country-folk songs. Using his musical fame as a springboard, Roberts embarks on his political career, backed by press aide Chet MacGregor (Ray Wise) and the shadowy Lukas Hart III (Alan Rickman, whose Mephistophelean presence almost steals the movie). Along the way, Roberts is tailed by journalist Bugs Raplin (Giancarlo Esposito), who is eventually framed for an assassination attempt on Roberts when he gets too close to uncovering Hart's and Roberts' shady involvement in both the Iran-Contra and S&L debacles of the '80s. Largely viewed at the time of its release as a broad slap at the New Right, in retrospect Robbins is nearly as critical of the Old Left. Vidal's Brickley Paiste is old, tired, and nearly irrelevant (and, sadly, seems to know it).  If Robbins is scathing in his indictment of the Right, Paiste symbolizes Robbins' criticism of the Left for their lack of energy and ideas.  Given the kind of pasting Democrats received in the '94 election, more of them would have done well to pay attention to Robbins' uncannily prescient warning. Cameos abound.  Watch for the likes of Susan Sarandon, Helen Hunt, and others as reporters, as well as country singer Kelly Willis as Joan Baez to Robbins' Dylan. One final note  In a perfect example of life imitating art once again, Bob Roberts neatly foreshadowed R.J. Cutler and David Van Taylor's A Perfect Candidate, a 1996 documentary of Oliver North's 1994 Virginia Senate campaign.  Ironically, Cutler had been invited by North's handlers to film the campaign because they had liked his earlier documentary, The War Room, on which Cutler had worked with - you guessed it - D.A. Pennebaker. Watch all three in chronological order someday if you have the time.

The script goes a little far at the end but for some reason I found it strangely chilling instead of stretched.The music is excellent and very well used.  The way it is really right wing but yet very catchy makes the point about how easy it is to sweeten any pill.  Much of it is outright funny and is very sharp and is a real credit to the ability of Robbins.Robbins as writer, director and co-composer is great but as actor he also shines.  His Roberts may be a little caricatured at times but he gets through that.  The support cast is all famous and are all good, Esposito is excellent as always, Rickman, Wise etc are all good but even the cameos from the likes of Spader, Cusack and Sarandon are witty.Overall this is very much an one man show and he wears it well.  It has it's flaws in that it's a little far fetched and untidy but for most part it's sharp and darkly funny.

Written, directed, and starring Tim Robbins, it's the story of a rightwing folksinger entertainer who rises to be United States Senator from that state with a big hint of further ambition. For in 1994 one Rick Santorum was elected in that Republican year in that state against a comfortable liberal named Harris Wofford in much the same manner as Robbins's Bob Roberts defeats Senator Brickley Paiste.Santorum was Bob Roberts without the singing. Once again life does imitate art.For satire to be successful it must be both humorous and have the touch of chiffon. This is the reason that Dr. Strangelove as a film succeeds so brilliantly and why Bob Roberts fails. Robbins's film has all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. He did satirize one thing in Bob Roberts quite brilliantly, but without even knowing it I'm sure. Gore Vidal's character of Senator Brickley Paiste is nothing short of brilliant for the wrong reasons. He plays the part of a comfortable old, fashionably liberal Senator who has lost contact with the grassroots brilliantly. And I do so love that Dickensian name.Once upon a time the Democratic was confident and assured in its way of being the majority party with its alliance with big labor and big city political machines to turn out the vote. It's dirty little secret was that it relied on generations old resentments from the children and grandchildren of immigrant arrivals who were treated really bad by the Republican party and its WASP base. Where I grew up in Brooklyn, people were taught to vote the Column on the voting machine with the star which is the Democratic symbol in New York State. Just go down the row even if Caligula's horse is there.A man like Brickley Paiste came on the scene in 1960 as he says in his whiny valedictory with John F. Kennedy and that was around the height of the Democrat's confident majority. Times and issues do change and I won't do a history of what happened in those thirty years. One thing was that workers went from over 50% unionized to about half of that.Another was the rise of Political Action Committees, Republicans did it first and still do it best. A third was sadly the religious right with no real effort to counter it from the other end of the spectrum. All this and more combined to make the Democratic majority ripe for the taking in 1994 in which the Santorum-Wofford race was a small part.But if life does imitate art we are pleased with the fact in 2006 Rick Santorum became an ex-Senator probably more to do with the fact he was just too conservative ultimately for a place like Pennsylvania than anything else. So the real life Bob Roberts does go down, Brickley Paiste is vindicated.Even in the days of television and the internet you still can't fool all the people all the time.

But like all good satire, Bob Roberts doesn't let anyone off easy. TV journalists are portrayed as as easily manipulated airheads. Democratic politicians (represented here with wonderful dryness by Gore Vidal as Senator Paiste) are portrayed as effete and out-of-touch. And at least some members of the great American public are shown as celebrity-dazed sheep, hungering to surrender their liberties to a charismatic but authoritarian ruler.What's ironically sad about this hilarious film is -- everything in it has come true and then some. The American political scene has gotten far more rotten than anything envisioned in this decade-old satire. Now in 2003 we have an unelected president that leads us to war with lies, which the corporate-owned media isn't permitted call him on. The entertainment-sotted public can't be bothered, and the Democratic opposition cowers in fear of being labelled unpatriotic.

The film relates the ascension of a charismatic yuppie from Philadelphia, a 35-year old self-made, a gifted swordsman, guitar player and folk singer named Bob Roberts.Like the most memorable movie characters, Bob Roberts is a man of fascinating contradictions his conservative views are swept off by his youth, handsomeness and communicative smile while his notorious aversion toward the 60's rebelliousness is expressed through folk songs performed in public à la Bob Dylan.It's not coincidental that the film is Tim Robbins' directorial debut, and that he wrote and starred in it, for it immediately echoes another political classic  Citizen Kane. When you watch Bob Roberts, you don't have Charles Foster Kane in mind, but as he slowly sinks into the darkest side of his personality, the film gets more distant to its initial satirical tone, and become closer to a powerful character study, scary because true.The strength of Bob Roberts is its multi-layered directing, flirting so many tones and styles. The documentary format allows jumping from one scene to another, without caring for its disjointed aspect. We follow Roberts visiting a school, singing in public, being acclaimed by fans or criticized by a journalist, played by Lynne Thigpen. She provides the first interesting insight by calling Roberts a Machiavellian poseur even though at that moment, Roberts still strikes as a normal politician. Aren't they all Machiavellian poseurs anyway? But one character regularly pops us as the troublemaker Giancarlo Espositio plays Bugs Alijah Raplin, a black journalist and activist who discovered the implications of Roberts' anti-drugs foundation with some third-world countries' traffic. Robert's right hand, Lukas Hart III, played by Alan Rickman, has been accused several times but no proof was found whatsoever. According to Raplin, one of the reasons the media doesn't treat the information is because they belong to politicians. Later, an incident during a live TV program proves him right. Bugs' insistence and undesirability inspires a cruel machination against him that will also help Roberts to leverage the number of voters. Bugs, as the attacker who'd turn to be a victim, is an interesting counterpart to the titular character's flamboyance, being everything he's not, he's not an upper class WASP, he doesn't have the same sex-appeal or charisma, he's marginalized by his quest of the truth. The contrast is too obvious though, and I guess the subtle portrayal of Senator Baiste by Gore Vidal, as Roberts' opponent.Vidal embodies the honesty of a politician born with true idealism, a man who has certainly been impacted by James Stewart in Mr Smith Goes to Washington and believed that John F. Kennedy would change America, before the disillusioning aftermath of his assassination. Like Bugs, Baiste is victim of a cruel machination accusing him of abusing an underage girl. He never truly recovers from the accusation in the polls, and as he doesn't believe in negative campaigning, never strikes back.Baiste's interventions bring the most interesting insights about American politics, and I read in IMDb trivia that most of his statements were improvised, which provides a supplementary level of spontaneity and truth. Baiste is actually not surprised by Roberts' appeal. He knows the guy has connections with the CIA, which had proved to work for Nixon. The film is set at the verge of the first Gulf War, and since the beginning, despite the seemingly diplomatic efforts going on, we know the dice are cast.As the storyline progressed, I felt the film lost its realism, got too sensational, even too radical in its attempt to denounce some extreme wings of American policy. Roberts' fans got more and more demonic, forming a sort of collective trance where Roberts was less a political leader than a modern-day guru. They hear what they want to hear, they don't complain, all they want is to have the right to get their share of the American Dream, and from the mouth of a businessman, the share is not symbolical. Roberts doesn't speak about values, but about greed and success, incarnating a cynical detachment that even the crisis of 1987 hadn't defeated.But while I felt the film went too far after the assassination attempt on Roberts, I realized on a second thought that the film couldn't have been more accurate. Are the manipulations orchestrated by Robert's team unconceivable? Just think of Richard Nixon, think of the way George W. Bush attacked Iraq on the basis of false accusation. Yes, politics is made of lying, as Vidal said, it's all about justifying a threat by taking a local thug and waving its menace as a Hitler-like figure. The same manipulation of the Baiste scandal echoes the way, the Bush camp tried avoided the debate about his enlisting in the Vietnam war. History repeats itself. It's true that the portrayal of radicals flirt with caricature while the realism of movies like JFK and Nixon didn't make them less flattering about politicians.Bob Roberts is refreshing because it points the finger on the danger of radical beliefs, and the way they lead to disasters, in the name of so-called values. And since I mentioned Nixon and JFK, I realize that the 90's might be the best decade for political movies, Oliver Stone took the dramatic approach while Bob Roberts and Wag the Dog, another gem of Black comedy, were more satirical but, at the end, more prophetic. Maybe it's due to the fact that the 90's were still close enough to the 70's, so the Nixon's trauma wasn't healed yet, and close enough to the 2000's, so people could foreshadow the fanatical path America was taking.The pedagogic aspect of Bob Roberts is undeniable, but it's its prophetic value that makes the whole experience chilling, behind the genuine laughs it generates.

However, now, under the reign King Bush (formerly the more benign idiot prince), 'Bob Roberts' might as well be a true documentary depicting current American politics, which range from the apathetic to the neo-con lunatic. The neo-con lunatic, the zealot, Roberts has become more relevant in these times; he is a manifestation of reactionary America in the 21st century. The film owes much to the writings of Gore Vidal, or Senator Brickley Paiste, as he is known in the film. Vidal has described, in detail, over the past few decades, the demise of the American republic and the rise of the American Empire. Vidal cites the formation of the American National Security State of the Truman Administration as America's bid to control the world, a mortal blow to the republic. Bob Roberts is the hell-spawn of this National Security State and its many crimes, namely the Iran-Contra Scandal. He is a rebel. His revolution is aimed at destroying the old liberal order. Like Ronald Reagan, he pledges to make us proud to be Americans, virtuous defenders of freedom and more importantly international free markets that were sanctified with the blood of the many foreigners who died in our holy peripheral wars against Communism (Vietnam, Nicaragua, El Salvador, etc). Bob Roberts is a conservative of apocalyptic proportions and yet frighteningly familiar. He becomes more familiar everyday. This is how 'Bob Roberts' crystallizes the appalling mess that is political America - more accurate today than when it was written.

An author knowing his subject is a must, or as the old saying goes, write what you know. Responsibly, no one would read a book, especially a satire, without finding out a little about its author (at the very least there's usually a bio on the back sleeve). An author's political slant tells you what the story is about; his writing skills dress it up. What weight or importance we give the story is based on that author's intellectual, educational and professional credentials in the area of his subject. In other words, if the author was once the director of the CIA and writes a spy novel it seems pretty reasonable that the story would be plausible and the facts about the inner workings of the spy business pretty much on target. If the author was a waitress in a small mid-western town and writes a tale about the politics of small-town mid-western life it seems pretty reasonable that she would have a unique expertise in that area. So now we have Bob Roberts, written, directed, and starring Tim Robbins an actor and former member of Los Angeles' Actors' Gang, an experimental ensemble that expressed radical political observations through the European avant-garde form of theater. Tim Robbins is a self-proclaimed left-wing political activist who has made no attempts personally or professionally to hide his disdain for American values (he prefers European values) and hatred for conservatives and nationalism (he prefers liberalism, socialism and internationalism). His story-line for Bob Roberts is campaigns and politics, a subject matter Tim Robbins the author has virtually no experience in professionally or intellectually (he was a drama major at UCLA), but alas, this is Hollywood where a drop-out like Martin Sheen can pretend he is President on screen and off. Why actually know your subject when you can just make it up as you go along? It sure as heck beats having to know the subject professionally or have any real insights. If a story is built on the knowledge and expertise of the author then Bob Roberts is not really a story of politics or campaigns. It is on the surface a story of acting, Bob Roberts is an actor, a con man who pretends to be one thing but is actually another. Tim Robbins, the actor had been acting professionally for about a decade when Bob Roberts came out so one has to give their own assessment for what constitutes experience in this department. The point I am making is that acting is his only experience so playing a con man can't be too much of a stretch. Given that his roles included an astronaut, a prisoner and a Viking, a con man is virtually home turf. During his professional career Tim Robbins formed his political views which became what the story of Bob Roberts is about dressed up as political satire. If you are looking for substantial facts or any connection to the truth you won't find them here, but why would you? Consider the source of the information...or more precisely the lack of information. If you are interested in left-wing anti-American sentiment the libraries are filled with books by qualified individuals who studied decades of philosophical viewpoints, some even holding political power. You may disagree with their philosophies but at least they spell out the philosophy, perhaps offering examples lifted from experience and they don't re-write the philosophies of others. The points of view are left bare for people to either agree, partially agree or disagree based on their merits. Bob Roberts is a dangerous film, and an inaccurate one, because it doesn't support its philosophy by spelling out what it believes. Instead it incorrectly describes other people's philosophies based on emotion, not facts. Like a spoiled brat the film can't find anything nice to say about itself or it's viewpoint, so it makes up something bad about others. This is Hollywood fake-believe. Don't expect it to be factual.

The story has to do with country singing candidate Robbins going up against a liberal (Gore Vidal). Robbins attempts to fool the doubters who don't see much potential in him by coming up with some inventive ways to guarantee political success for him. Some amusing moments and the film's release during the 1992 U.S. presidential campaign made it appropriately topical but there aren't enough memorable moments to make this film a standout. Star gazers may appreciate its many cameos, though.

(The difference between the real G. Bush and the fictional B. Roberts is that Roberts thinks for himself - Bush just reads his folksy script instead of writing it.) The weakness of the film is the sentimental romanticizing of conspiracy-minded Left interventionist / martyrs. The best of America is its conceptually muddy but essentially good-natured, practical middle - you'll know America is back on track and in the real world when you can't tell the difference between the Dems and Reps.

That's the politicians job. Bob Roberts is a messy satire on the American political campaign process which is shot as a pseudo-documentary. The film features a bunch of stars in bit parts, something which is more of a liability than as asset, as it follows it's stereotypical characters through the senatorial campaign duel between the ultraconservative title character (Robbins) and his  more liberal adversary. Overall the flick is a good production, albeit messy, but gets lost and confused in a conglomeration of political  commercials, newscasts, interviews, photo-ops, etc. In the final analysis it's difficult to see worth in this film which has no clear message and little entertainment value.

It was a bald attempt to frame the whole Republican Right with an utterly unsupported-by-any real-case composite of what Hollywood thinks of Conservatives. These are the same overpaid limo liberal who complain about the public's absolutely correct impression that they are leftist who are out of touch with America. People that can be considered straight and law abiding are vilified as bigots while criminal, pornographic, self indulgent trash is portrayed as virtuous. So much for my rant against these divorce-a-week family values folks.The movie was trash because the premise of it was so dishonest and partisan, it nullified any technical or stylistic virtues, as few as they are. Gore Vidal, a meretricious, left wing anti-American/Semite intellectual was chosen to play his Bob's virtuous liberal Senatorial rival. That alone says it all. In Hollywood, they still regard proved Communist spies and traitors as victims of a witch hunt, while patriots are vilified as frauds and bigots. I hate all the cheap shots this film made, it was so blatant and pathetic.The people who made this schlock are the same limo liberals who call for more gun control while they glorify and purvey gun violence in an almost religious fashion. The way Hollywood fawns over degenerates like black criminals masquerading as social critics, ala Mumia and Tupac, phony leftist peace terrorist, man hating women murderers, and abortionist should give you a hint. There is absolutely nothing in this film that makes it worth viewing unless you live in a fantasy world where Abby Hoffman is a hero.Basically, the movie is a mockumentary, where Bob Roberts is some hustler who ad-libs Conservative lines but is totally amoral. Like he fakes an assassination attempt to frame some crackpot black reporter who was dogging him. There isn't even a hint of fairness in it, like maybe a conservative might have some valid comments. Heck, I don't buy talk radio clichés about baaad liberals that are all Godless Commies or goooood conservatives, that are so full of patriotism and God nor do I mind a little liberal spin, but this is just leftist propaganda pure and simple. I don't hate Clinton, but the sleaze around him never seems to ever get condemned in the least by schlockmeisters like Tim Robbins. He is a good actor, but his politics stink and this movie is all politics.

The man is a typical ultra-Liberal of the last decade full of hate and insults, but no solutions to anything.Never better was that presented in this lame so-called satire, which was just another vehicle for a Hollywood Loony Left-winger to expunge his hatred of conservatives, Republicans, Christians, etc. Robbins has the conservative Republican political candidate as a little bit below Neanderthal status. Yup, that ignorant right-winger is a liar, a thief, racist, homophobic, nasty, mean, corrupt and who knows what else. (Little did Robbins know he was describing today's Democratic candidates to a tee!)Robbins tries to disguise his heavy-handed attempts at doing nothing but ingratiating himself with the Liberal Hollywood bigwigs with some folksy songs and says all of this is just a satire. Puh-leeze. It's obvious what the intent of the film was, and it wasn't for lighthearted laughs. If nothing else, the casting of Gore Vidal tells you something. He's not even an actor, but being a left-wing icon, he gets a role.One thing this movie did well it gave us a prime example of Hollywood and its extreme political leanings and bias.....and total disdain for the American viewing public, which appropriately turned thumbs down on this propaganda piece.

He has a So called populist appeal that draws folks to him. Now of course this is a satire on the Right, heaven forbid if it were off of the Left. Robbins of course is a well known leftist activist and therefore, his portrayal of a Right Winger is going to be suspect. Hollywood enough with the corrupt Right Wing Business man who will pollute the evironment for his gain, or the Conservative xenophobist being racist to poor immigrants or the Conservative Businessman who will kill for money. This type of imagery is tiring middle America and pushing more of us Moderates to the Right, not only Hollywood but Liberals, especially White Liberals in general. Why continue to portray Conservative Businessmen or CEO's as corrupt and money crazy and start portraying Democratic backed Trial Lawyers as the equally greedy fiends themselves? Why not make a movie where White Upper Class Progressives use the poorer classes to their own political and monetary detriment. Beatty's Bullworth did not do such a bad job, and it was the farthest I have seen to viable Leftist self-Criticization on film. "}{"Title":"Hollywood Bashes The Right Again.

Sure, perhaps Eddie Murphy can play Ann Coulter in his next movie.  Since solid conservative political philosophies are inevitably treated in Hollywood as racist, corrupt, stupid, extortionary, unfair, and indefensible -- surely you wouldn't expect a movie directed by its star, Tim Robbins, to be any different.  The best part of the movie are the two scenes that are basically stolen right out of A Face In The Crowd.  Left to his own devices, Robbins attempts at Schulberg like satire have all the subtlety of a lug-wrench.  If you love Tim Robbins and hate the Establishment, this movie will give you all the validation you want.  Otherwise, stay away from this self-serving vanity production.  2/10.

There are enough clever jokes and songs to have made this into a couple of short Saturday Night Live skits, but even the flock of tired old Hollywood lefties couldn't keep me awake for long.Some of the other reviewers' comments are actually much funnier than most of this script, and their claim that the media has a conservative slant is a real side-splitter, as this movie itself proves all too well. Fortunately for the impressionable kiddies (who are the only audience this could impress), much of the lampoonery is so heavy-handed that it falls far short of its mark.Embarrassingly below the standards of a real parodic masterpiece such as WAG THE DOG, it's hard to see how even the usual limousine liberals of Hollywood could help but be embarrassed by this -- one of Robbins' low points.With Robbins and this cast this could have been great.

You can tell any appearance of normalcy at the start is going to end with you hating Bob Roberts. Watching the film, I was just waiting for the other shoe to drop.Bob Roberts uses his music to win votes. Apparently when Bill Clinton played his saxophone that was okay, but now Robbins wants to turn it around and make it look like a Republican is evil for doing that.Roberts is also evil for equating the 60's to Communism. Read David Horowitz, one of the architects of the 60's movements, to see that, yes, it *was* about Communism! Duh. Did anyone seriously think it was anything else? How else do you think Communists spread their faulty system around the globe? Lefties in Hollywood will never forgive the Republican Reagan for halting the spread of Communist governments in South America and other parts of the world. From what Robbins pushes in this film, it seems like he is against individual achievement, personal responsibility, low taxes and smaller government. What a moron.A black woman near the start of the film, who is a lefty like most of the media, criticizes him as Machiavelian. Jesus! And what are Democrats when they take down Richard Nixon or Clarence Thomas?In real life, the media is overwhelmingly dominated by lefties. They paint all their democrats as the second coming of Jesus, yet in *this* movie, the media is skewing the news towards favoring Republicans. What color is the sky in this movie?! In Tim-Robbinsland, Republicans are all volcanic, yelling people with no real values. When Bob Roberts goes on a Saturday Night Live type of show, a staff member criticizes it for being a commercial. Uh, like didn't Clinton go on Arsenio Hall and John Kerry went on the Daily Show? After an incident in the film, Republicans are shown to have a mob mentality. Yeah, like all those radical-left protests that turned into looting rampages were Republican driven. Time and again Robbins is criticizing where there is no basis in real life. It is just strange.The musical numbers that punctuate the film are ironic, because Robbins wants to show us how musicians use music to push right-wing messages. Uh, yeah. Sorry, but lefties control the media and lefties have been pushing messages in their songs, movies and programs for decades. Funny how he manages to point the finger the other way.Republican followers are all shown as being like cultists and one even tattoos BOB into his forehead. The funny thing is, Republicans noticed the cult of Clinton long before this. Robbins whole aim with this film is to turn reality on it's head and pretend Republicans are doing everything the Democrats are guilty of. "}]
