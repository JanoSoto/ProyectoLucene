Where as scientists tell us that global warming is the result of smokestacks and deforestization and factories, this film has other ideas.  And the ones that are in here are a little more frightening than what the scientists think. Think for one second all that has happened over the last decade or so. Think of all the ecological changes that we are facing right now.  These crisis are all a result of our greed and our industrializaton, which in a way can be a euphanism of greed.  And this film takes all that we know about ozones and animal extinction and global warming and such and puts its own little spin on it.  What if a species that is greater than us has looked at what we are and decided that we are too stupid to take care of our own planet so they will take it away from us.  After all, according to the theories that this movie subscribes to, we are wasting and destroying this planet anyway, why not speed up the process?Charlie Sheen stars as an astronomer who thinks he hears a definitive signal from outer space.  But when he brings it to his boss he learns that due to budget cut backs his department is being eliminated.  So his signal theory falls on deaf ears.  But from here on out the movie becomes almost Hitchcockian in the way that you have a character that knows something that no one will believe, not his superiors, not his girlfriend, not even his friends.  And so it is up to him to try and find a way to convince everyone that he is not crazy and that he is telling the truth.  And what makes this film work so well is two things really.  The first being the story that was written David Twohy.  He also wrote The Fugitve so we know right away he is a good writer.  Here he has some excellent characters and crisp dialogue for them to speak.  The script is a real positive here.  But the second thing about this film that really makes it work is the portrayal that Sheen gives of Zane.  Sheen always looks confused and amazed at the same time.  He can't believe what it is that he has uncovered and his expressions and his mannerisms really do his character justice.  I can honestly say that the last time I saw fear like this from anyone that saw aliens first hand was in James Cameron's incredible 1986 film Aliens.  It has taken ten years for someone else to get an actor to show true fear when it comes to the subject of ETs.  Most films have the stars crack clever jokes about the aliens that they are meeting for the first time.  They rarely show fear but in The Arrival, Sheen is always afraid.  He is never shown as anything more than a normal human being that has uncovered an ugly truth about the true agenda of what the aliens are realy up to.  His performance is one of the best things about this film.The Arrival is intense.  It doesn't stop for a breather too often and it is very intelligent.  It has interesting opinions and it also makes you question our own intentions when it comes to the well being of our planet. Most people passed this one over when it came out because Independence Day came out a mere month later, but as good as ID4 was, this is a different kind of movie.  It is more serious and has an opinion on some very political issues.  It never runs out of steam and it is very entertaining.  I highly recommend that you give it a chance.

Most people opted to watch the latter film for all its big action scenes, which left The Arrival a box office loser, a destination it most definitely did not deserve.  Since then, it has gained some life on video and will probably gain more popularity since the film marks the debut of director David Twohy, who is proving to be a force to reckon with in Hollywood, especially after his success with Pitch Black.Zane Ziminski (Charlie Sheen) is a brilliant radio astronomer who, along with his partner (Richard Schiff), receive a radio signal which Ziminski believes was emitted from an extraterrestrial source.  But as soon as he hands the recording over to his boss Phil Gordian (Ron Silver), everything seems to go wrong.  Zane is fired, his estranged girlfriend Charlotte (Teri Polo) is transferred, his partner dies of an apparent suicide, and the tape of the recording has seemingly vanished.Ziminski's new job, as a cable repairman, gives him access to his neighborhood's attena dishes, which he lines up together into a phased array in hopes of receiving the signal again.  To his luck, the signal returns, but it's coming from a small town called San Marsol in Mexico.  Heading down there, he meets a scientist named Ilana Green (Lindsay Crouse), who is down there studying the rising temperatures of third-world countries.  As Ziminski continues his investigation, he believes he may have uncovered a worldwide alien conspiracy.What makes The Arrival as great a film as it is is because of the story, which is smart and interesting.  Rather than giving us mindless action scenes, writer/director Twohy prefers to keep our attention with an intelligent story.  Despite this being his first time behind the camera, he proves himself an adroit filmmaker, weaving the story together brilliantly, and unfolding little plot surprises along the way.The Arrival is primarily a thriller, and Twohy is more than competent at creating action and suspense (witness Pitch Black), both elements of which are sharply executed in this film.  The final hour of the film is full of edge-of-the-seat excitement.  Composer Arthur Kempel's score also adds an extra bit of tension. The film moves at a lightning pace and there's never a loss of momentum or a lag in the running time, which runs smoothly throughout all 115 minutes.The cast is also strong, with Charlie Sheen taking top acting honors.  I'm a little suprised of all the statements claiming he was miscast for the role. If anything, he's the only person who could play the part, and he comes through superbly, never failing to convince for a moment.  Teri Polo is decent as Sheen's girlfriend, and while her character isn't developed as well, she still makes an impression in her limited screentime.  Ron Silver is utterly chilling as Ziminski's boss, who wisely underplays the role, rather than chewing the scenery.It's truly a breath of fresh air to watch a sci-fi thriller that relies on logic and plausibility to carry the story.  For viewers who enjoy a fine story and believable science with their sci-fi, The Arrival is a true must see.

The movie has a classic premise about a radio astronomer (Charlie Sheen) who receives a signal from outer space that may or may not have come from extraterrestrial life.To say anymore would be unforgivable, as Twohy packs in believable twists and turns throughout the plot, which is fun without insulting the brain, and complex without ever bogging down in mind-numbing confusion. The script does have a few head-scratchers here and there (I was particularly miffed that Lindsay Crouse's character, an environmentalist, wasn't familiar with the concept of terraforming) and some contrivances, but they're hardly bothersome and aren't noticeable until a second viewing.As good a screenwriter as Twohy is, he's even more adept as a director (further proven by Pitch Black, a superbly crafted deep-space thriller with a script not even half as smart as The Arrival's). With great pacing and precise editing, Twohy builds momentum with each discovery Sheen unfolds, until it culminates to an edge-of-the-seat climax that's quite satisfying (unlike...cough...cough...V the Final Battle, Independence Day).The cast is all-around effective, with Sheen delivering a surprisingly terrific performance as the paranoid astronomer. It's great to see an intelligent protagonist who thinks his way out of tight jams, rather than shooting and blowing up everything in sight. No one else gets half of Sheen's screentime, but Ron Silver is nicely ambiguous as his boss, and Teri Polo, however underused, is fine as Sheen's girlfriend. Lindsay Crouse also makes a good impression as an environmentalist studying some strange activity.On a technical level, some sci-fi fans might be a little disappointed. Those weaned on V and ID4 will notice the lack of large-scale special effects. Sorry, no disc-shaped motherships here. Still, the visuals present are mostly decent, certainly passable enough that they don't become a distraction to the plot. Despite the use of CGI in its more primitive stages (this was '96, after all) the effects are still occasionally excellent and imaginative, such as the spherical object those tight-lipped men wield. Composer Arthur Kempel's score adds a bit more tension to the already excruciating suspense, and evokes a creepy atmosphere during the film's quieter moments.Remember, folks, The Arrival is a rarity, a once in a while example of how pure movie magic can be created when we've got dedicated filmmakers who want to intrigue the audience rather than catering to demographics just for the sake of box office returns. Forget Independence Day, The War of the Worlds, or V and its sequel, The Arrival is the most satisfying cinematic depiction of alien invasion to date.

Its a well done movie about aliens visiting earth, overall the story is nothing original (but it does have more then a few tricks up its sleeve) and is your typical Alien invader movie.Watching this on television years later its hard to appreciate just how well this film was shot.  One scene in particular involving a large dish and someone almost falling off the side of it almost caused me to make a mess in my pants when first watching the film on the big screen.When I saw it the theater was mostly empty (not good for the movie, but it probably allowed us to enjoy it some more) and it was its first run (did it have a second?).  Its sad the film didn't do as well as it should have, at the time it was the best alien related movie in theaters (I seem to remember independence day being out at the same time).My one gripe is a somewhat weak ending (especially considering the strength of the rest of the movie).  Overall it is an entertaining and somewhat thought provoking film that you won't regret watching unless you don't like movies that emphasize suspense instead of action.  And there is a LOT of suspense in this film.  It doesn't skimp on action either but it saves it for the end of the movie where it belongs and makes some sense.Some people may not like its message either but I didn't have a problem with it and it certainly didn't get overly preachy.  People voice their opinions on screen just as someone would do in real life, and I don't have a problem with that.  The real focus of the movie is aliens, not the environment. If you fixate on the environmental message in the movie then you probably have some issues or just don't get this type of movie.  Global warming is more of a subplot that leads Mr Sheen in a certain direction and nothing more.The special effects are fairly spartan but effective and nicely creepy when they are used.Some of the characters are kind of annoying but are necessary, and don't detract from the film overall.A worthwhile rental, especially if you have a large TV to watch it on.

They meet each other in a small Mexican town, where Zane finds that aliens are preparing to annihilate the human race and preparing Earth for their occupation.The Arrival has a good story that uses the abnormal raise of temperature and change in the climate on Earth as part of a plot of invasion of our planet by aliens. Director David Twohy follows the same style of John Carpenter in this movie. However, there are two problems the first one is the permanent lunatic expression of Charlie Sheen, who also keeps insane attitudes along the whole story, giving a total lack of credibility to his character. The second one is probably the budget, or a badly developed screenplay, with flaws along the narrative.

The movie was slated to start ten minutes past the hour and I didn't arrive there until five after. Then I had to go through the concession stand crowd. When I finally reached the theater -- the large screen was engrossed by a huge satellite disk and there was some guy talking. Damn, I thought. I just missed the start of the movie. It wasn't three seconds after that realization that I had another one. This isn't the movie. It's a commercial. A commercial which it turned out for one of the large multi-billion dollar phone companies. Talk about false scares.Some people have called 'The Arrival' a thinking man's science fiction movie. While the jury is still out on that, I will say it's not stupid either. It is however one more of those 'one man saves the world' flicks. Which are never terribly realistic, but on their own terms, entertain. Charlie Sheen plays Zane Zaminski. A smart, but soon-to-be paranoid astrophysicist who has the slithery Godian (Ron Silver) for a boss. One day watching the satellites some anomaly passes his screen. Suddenly the search is on. What was it? WHO was it? Not letting the subject go gets him fired from his job and deeper and deeper he journeys into the paranoia.The Arrival is one part use your mind, two parts conspiracy theory. As Zane takes it upon himself to get to the bottom of things and find out who's involved and to what lengths they'll go to suppress everything. Soon we start to see elements straight out of the X Files. Aliens... conspiracy... colonization. The story has it's own set of implausibilities, but things move at such a pace that there isn't much time to question them. Zane knows something is going on and the deeper he digs the more we find out. It's all about the ride. Could one man really stop such things from happening? Probably not, but that doesn't stop 'The Arrival' from being a fun time.

The cons of this film are the common pitfalls in every low-budget sci-fi, not to mention the haggard-loner-versus-the-shadowy-big-conspiracy genre. The plot turns and dialog are mostly predictable, and the composition is sloppy at times. My guess is this film was treated to a fairly brutal production schedule.That said, this movie has a lot going for it. Sheen does just an excellent job - he carries the film. All the Estevez/Sheens have been in some pretty bad films, not to mention - gag - TV, but talent and professionalism really runs deep in that family.The (human) characters are refreshingly human and believable, a sharp contrast to Independence Day which, another reviewer mentioned, came out at the same time.I also appreciated the clear-eyed treatment of the science-y stuff. I totally disagree that this is a message movie - if there is a message about global warming here, it is that aliens are causing it! Hardly a boon to the tree-hugger cause. And the head alien getting all pious at the end about humans not deserving the earth - this is not exactly a sympathetic character! So I fail to see this as a guilt trip. On the other hand, it is interesting that topics like terraforming and colonization of other planets are creeping into real mainstream scientific discussion now, almost a decade after this film's release. If there is a not-so-cool- when-it-happens-to-you message here, you still have to give the filmmakers credit for being ahead of the curve.I generally assume that films that look like they suck always do - but every once in a while you stumble across one that doesn't!

The movie has an interesting premise we Earthlings are heating up our world by creating man-man (anthropogenic) greenhouse gases. Aliens arrive who have a way of masking their true bodies with a device that allows them to appear human. They can live in high heat that would be unpleasant, if not lethal, to a normal human being. And because human beings clearly do not deserve Earth because we're destroying it by overheating it, the aliens arrive to artificially heat up the atmosphere even more with greenhouse gases to kill us all off. One must remember the movie came out in 1996. At that time skepticism on a wide scale existed regarding the effects of global warming, which more correctly should be called more extreme global climate change.All this being said, the movie is riddled with weak points. First there is the chief character, Zane Zaminsky (Charlie Sheen). I first saw Sheen perform in Olive Stone's Platoon (1985) and thought he did a credible job. At that time I thought he might even turn out as good as his dad (Martin Sheen). That of course didn't happen. In The Arrival he plays a perpetually excited and fearful radio astronomer based at a NASA-operated installation whose mission is to try to detect radio signals coming from outer space signifying an alien civilization (SETI). Zane detects something that convinces him this is the signal and tries to convince his boss, Phil Gordian (Ron Silver), that he received a message from aliens. Gordian pooh-poohs it and gets rid of Zane. Zane being fired, he shoots out on his own. Zane has issues with his girlfriend, Char (Teri Polo), who doesn't see the big picture like Zane sees it. Zane meets a young black kid, Kiki (Tony Johnson), who helps with his enterprise. With his jerry-rigged apparatus Zane detects a signal identical to the one he got before, except that it's not coming from outer space. It's coming from somewhere in Mexico. He shoots down to Mexico and bumps into a climatologist there (Lindsay Crouse) who also knows something's up. Meanwhile it turns out Gordian is an alien-in-disguise and sends two alien-in-disguise goons to destroy Zane's apparatus. Zane finds the alien nest in a privately-operated plant in Mexico (it turns out there are many of them located in third-world countries). The company is supposedly involved in legitimate electrical generation but in reality it's generating instead vast amounts of greenhouse gases. Zane gets rid of the aliens in the plant. The climatologist is killed off by hordes of black scorpions planted in her hotel room by one of the aliens. Zane journeys back to NASA headquarters in LA and confronts Gordian and his goons. He eventually triumphs over the aliens and warns Kiki (who it turns out is also an alien) that their game is over and to tell his masters to send no more aliens to Earth.Good points I found the depiction of the aliens convincing as was the premise. Bad points The script was wooden and the acting was mediocre. Summary OK for a rental movie if you need a sci-fi fix.

It's a lean piece of writing that moves quickly, and has some unexpected twists along the way.

Zane's desperate search for answers leads him to a mysterious power plant in Mexico generating much more than just electricity, and run by people who are not what they appear to be. The film's main strength arises from Twohy's writing, which manages to maintain decent dialogue, even when the plot mechanics take over. The movie never sinks into the realm of straight-to-video disaster. Sheen isn't ideally cast in the role of a scientist, but he is respectable and maintains a high level of intensity. The responsibility for the movie lies fully on Sheen's shoulders, and he carries the burden admirably.

Charlie Sheen has a few successes -- and failures -- due to luck, but most of his success come from dedication and intelligence.The aliens are generally plausible too. Some of their technology is a bit hard to believe, but don't require unreasonable suspension of disbelief. (Their disguises are questionable, but important to the plot and more believeable than alternatives in other movies. The device they used to shut down Charlie Sheen's follow-up experiments was questionable, but more fun to see in action than a work gang.) More important, the aliens' behavior is reasonable. They're very protective of their secrets, which they would have to be to maintain their cover. Rather than mistakes of overconfidence, their mistakes result from desire to keep a low profile.Vague possible spoilers They discover that the aliens are invading by using human weaknesses against us, rather than firepower. Why should they blow up enemies that can be manipulated into unknowing collaborators? They want the Earth, but they want it their way. The invaders understand that treachery can be more effective than firepower. The movie even has a mild environmental message that advances the story's final revelations, rather than distracting from the plot the way messages sometimes do. The movie doesn't even provide a total resolution, just a revelation of the aliens' secret that may be all that's necessary to defeat them.

Her research is being blocked but she discovers a rapid climate change underway. Zane Zaminsky (Charlie Sheen) and Calvin (Richard Schiff) working a radio telescope discover a signal from 14.6 light years away. It goes away before confirmation. Their NASA JPL boss Phil Gordian (Ron Silver) cuts the program claiming budget cuts. Then he destroys the data and blackballs Zane. The only job he can get is installing TV satellites. His marriage to Char (Teri Polo) is under stress. Using satellite dishes, he creates a personal radio telescope to search for the signal with the help of nosy neighbor kid Kiki. Both Green and Zaminsky zero in on a Mexican location.This is a nice paranoid conspiracy alien invasion movie. I like Sheen's side of the story. I doubt that both investigations would lead to the exact same place. Climate science isn't that precise. As for assassination attempts, crushed by a bathtub is one of the most unusual and laughable. It seems so much easier and more common to simply shoot them. However, I do really like the black hole metallic spheres.After a really good first half, the movie starts to run into problems. It's still pretty good. David Twohy is most notable for the Riddick franchise. He needs to simplify the second half and ramp up the action. It tries to be too cute with the story. The movie needs to end in Mexico or else there is an obvious simpler way for Zane to expose the conspiracy.

He is one of those science and computer experts that know how to set up an entire galactic tracking system in his house.He hits upon the information that aliens will take over our planet, not by destroying our environment but by helping finish what we have already started. Zane's investigation takes him deep inside their operation and to the big boss himself whose identity I will not reveal.This movie is smart. It isn't for the easily amused but rather for those seeking something a little different. There are no two more disreputable genres then horror and sci-fi so I look for new and different approaches in both. I liked the added touches in 'The Arrival'. There is a scene where a woman is getting ready for bed and doesn't know that there are scorpions all over the room. We know it and the scene builds a kind of fun terror. It wasn't necessary but I appreciated it.Like another great, underrated film of this genre, 'Body Snatchers' by Abel Ferrara, the movie argues that the aliens will take us over slowly, right under our noses. I like the way that the movie uses Global Warming as their function for taking over. That shows that writer/director David Twohy was thinking. He isn't content to just throw out special effects and fist fights. He wants to make a movie to entertain but he has good ideas and sees them through to the end.

In case they wanted to subdue us, would they do it by using brutal force as e.g. in the 'War of the Worlds' or other more indirect (but more effective nonetheless) means ? 'Arrival' is a film that depicts aliens already present on earth and working on their plan for domination.Charlie Sheen plays astrophysicist Zane Zaminsky who struggles to survive in science since he is getting paid by short-term grants that are about to expire. From his scientific observations he picks up a signal that leads him to aliens already present on earth. Sheen is a good actor and portrays the curious astrophysicist well enough with a charming touch of a slight paranoia and some beliefs in conspiracy theories. Sheen goes to the extremes to prove his point first to his girlfriend (played by Teri Polo) who initially distrusts him and then to his bosses in the observatory.The film has a strong b-movie character and I think that's the reason it is more entertaining given the subject; it takes more liberties with the script and even if the situations are a bit over the top sometimes they are still suspenseful.

It is about an alien invasion of Earth which has already begun. We know that this is what the movie is about, but we are not directly encountered by the aliens until later in the movie. What it does is that it slowly reveals to us that something is wrong. The movie opens with a huge patch of greenery in the North Pole, and then we are taken to a radio telescope where a beam sent from a star, Wolf 359 or something like that, is intercepted. When this beam is pursued, the main character meets lots of objections. Soon he uncovers an alien conspiracy to terraform the earth to their liking but releasing greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. As I said before the movie is very subtle in its execution, and it also leads you to think one thing, which then turns around and reveals something else. One is the nature of his girlfriend, and another is in the nuclear power plant. This is a pretty good movie with the message that if we don't start looking after our planet, then it might be given to somebody else. I guess there is a very strong environmental theme in this movie, and it is used with the backdrop of an alien invasion. It is not a movie where major battles are won, but rather more subtle in its ending. Though he may has succeeded, it is still open to speculation whether it really worked or not.

The Arrival is a film that appeals to a wider audience due to its continual action, along with a global message in its wake that affects us all.Zane Zaminsky, a radio astronomer, works in a job that in real life would be about as exciting as watching cows graze to most folks. Though for cinematic effect, this paranoid chair-jockey catches on to a massive conspiracy theory that the public has not a clue. It's a good thing we have Mr. ZZ flat top to undercover the truth no matter if it might risk him his job, family or freedom. He's a big-screen archetype that's self-sacrificing in his ways and uses his convenient scientific skills to fence off bad guys that range from suave to cookie-cutter at every turn.The Arrival on the surface is meant for basic entertainment. Apart from watching the main character figure out all his steps and moves on his own, the only time the brain starts to kick in is towards the latter part of the film with the truth coming out. Locales change and nifty devices are shown with state of the art CGI for its day. Though some of the film mechanics are dated as this is a movie-movie something that isn't grounded with real characters and full of events that are meant to look like trial and error but feel guided to go a certain way with the story. Its main perk is its constant traction forward, which makes it feel more like a suspense thriller than a sci-fi/action movie like Independance Day.

In their undisguised state they are bald, Kate Moss skinny, and able to leap tall buildings in a single bound. No need to rely on hokey contact lenses, when high technology can create any visual effect imaginable. The story lines have not progressed as much as the technology, but that can be a positive. The Arrival often feels reassuringly like those ingenuous '50s favorites, Invaders From Mars or War of the Worlds.

One night he finally gets a call. Wrong number or intergalactic static? When his superiors blow him off, Charlie rigs up his own receiver and follows the clues to Mexico, where aliens are indeed gathering (sounds just about right!).

The top of his head is narrow and sort of expands as you go down to his chin which gives the impression of a man desperately trying to swallow an ironing board. He sports a goatee which went out with the pop band 'Blue Rondo A La Turk' and a tiny pair of glasses in a doomed attempt to look like a scientist. Mr Sheen has two expressions.

In moments of high excitement he sticks his arms out and spins them around as if trying to impersonate a dragonfly. Perplexed by this eccentric display of thespianism, the aliens try to drain the energy out of Sheen by sending a metal ball to his apartment that sucks everything into it via an electro-magnetic vortex.

Kiki became Zane's (good character name by the way)friend and knew all about his latest discoveries. Why didn't he kill Zane before he went to Mexico? Addicionally, the security system at the ET's plant sucked. Really amateur stuff for some superior race with superior technology. Anyways, just go with it and have a good time.

While Zane Ziminsky is worked for a cable television to get by, he tries to construct his own version of radio telescope using Phase Array for a cheaper version, but equally effective.

So he goes see Carl, his assistant, but before that happens, he gets murdered. Another scientist on Green house gases, tries to get data from NASA, but everything seems wrong, no data, but she did identify green house gases comes from Mexico. So both Zeminsky and the women scientist independently traveled to Mexico. This is a classic Sci Fi, introducing the concepts of phase array, green house emissions, global warming, terraforming (to make it inhabitable on earth!), and then some. It is the most seriously under rated movie of all time, and if introduced in theaters it will stun intelligent viewer, but didn't take it, as theaters go for explosions, crashes, etc. but it would have been as good as category as Gattaca, but Gattaca as plot holes, this one is clearly the best.

THE ARRIVAL ('sci-fi', 1996) Obsessed with finding alien life, radio astronomer Zane (Charlie Sheen) scans the universe for any trace. Suddenly a signal is picked up. He takes the evidence to project leader Giordan (Ron Silver). Without reason Giordan dismisses the signal as a hoax and immediately closes the project. But Zanes' suspicions lead him to Mexico, origin of the mysterious signal.Critique Once in awhile the 'sci-fi' (like the 'horror') genre produces a film that to some extent redeems it of some of the saddest excuses in its long and curtailed history. 'The Arrival' is one of those films as well as one of the smartest.Writer-Director David Twohy is better known for penning some nifty action flicks (e.g. 'The Fugitive'). But this departure seems to fit him like a glove. The result is an intriguing blend of high-brow concepts with good ol'-'sci-fi' intrigue reminiscent of 1950s flicks. It has the feel of some of the classics like 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers', and 'Invaders from Mars'. Charlie Sheen is credible enough as the hectic hero, as is Ron Silver in another villainous role. But as in most futuristic fantasies the visual and makeup effect is the real draw card here. After years of churning out creatures of all shapes and sizes they still surprise with some unique creations. The story is well-paced with every situation and special effect complementing the action (watch for the funky rotating-vacuum-ball). Lets' hope David Twohy sticks to this genre for awhile longer.QUOTES Giordan 'If you can't tend to your own planet none of you deserve to live here.'

Actual science fiction as opposed to space opera or futuristic fantasy.  So rather unbelievable bits have been tossed in (the disguise machine is pretty darned ridiculous, if they have that type of technology, why do they need the crazy conspiracy...) but the basic story is an actual science fiction one.  This makes it quite different than most so-called science fiction movies where the guy with the sword manages to outfight a thousand laser rifle armed killer robot drones and then fly his lone spaceship into the entire evil empires fleet and wipe out the flag ship.First, the main character is a believable one.  Charlie Sheen is not who I would've picked for the role, but he does a fine job.  He has no special powers and wasn't trained as a Ninja Master by the marines.  He's not especially heroic, but reasonably intelligent and competent.  He's the type of a guy that probably reminds you of someone you actually know, as opposed to some sort of Chosen One or something.Second, even though there are aliens, there are no space battles.  Not a single scene where any space ships start blasting away at each other with plasma beams and photon torpedoes.  In fact, everyone stays on the planet.  There aren't even any giant Megazords or Battle Mechs or other crazy super-robots.Third, and most importantly, at the end of the movie, you don't go Well I'm glad I turned my brain off-otherwise thinking might have gotten in the way of enjoying the movie.  There are parts where suspension of disbelief is required, but they are small and easy to overlook.

Naturally, the power plants heating the world are all built in third-world countries without sufficient environmental regulations.  This situation rounds out the film's array of liberal conceits big business is bad; big government is good; and global warming--with or without alien intervention--is happening anyway.Credit where it's due The Arrival is well-produced, well-paced, and well-acted, with some good FX (including stop-motion aliens) and a startling opening sequence involving a poppy field in the Arctic.  It's defeated somewhat by its general familiarity, since it belongs to a long line of aliens-among-us flicks that go all the way back to the '50s.But in the final analysis, I'm happy to say that the American public didn't buy into The Arrival or its politics.

At one point, when his character was soberly praising the merits of abstinence, I nearly fell out of my chair laughing. Well, at least his bod was nice enough to look at, although his hairdo was a bit scary -- it looked like it would hurt if you touched it, and I was kind of hoping the aliens would shave some crop circles in it -- and I wasn't too thrilled about the goatee. Poor Charlie uses the same face for every emotion look angry, okay, eyes wide and intense. Look scared, okay, eyes wide and intense. INTENSE!

(Hey, I can do that too, by the way!) But then again, it was NOT really necessary for the plot, as we got to see in Galaxy Quest. The more I read books about science and evolution, the less thrilled I am with the lack of imagination when it comes to most aliens, who look like us only with different colors of skin, and a few strange protuberances.This movie does have a few very imaginative elements but they are surrounded by lots more unoriginal sci-fi ideas and tricks so obviously contrived to startle the audience, or develop pseudo-suspense, such as the ol' scorpions in the bedroom trick.But I do wish that some of these directors would get together and give us a movie that DOES have scary, suspenseful, sci-fi effects and elements, AND has some soul-searching substance (but not so much that it overshadows the main event, which is holy sh**, we're being attacked/visited by ALIENS!!!!!) We have some great alien films. Galaxy Quest and the MIBs are great entertainment, but those are comedies, so wouldn't satisfy someone hoping for a good scare. Starman, E.T. and Close Encounters are top-notch, although the aliens in Close Encounters were rather disappointing at the end (a bunch of bald little people surrounding a tall bald anorexic - a benevolent Ann Coulter without the hair).

This has lead to recent movies like Strange Days, Independence Day and The Arrival. Charlie Sheen, who has slipped into freefall since the heady days of Platoon, is Zane Ziminski, a radio telescope operator who searches the airwaves for alien contact from outer space.  When he encounters a radio signal he is sure is of alien origin, he submits it to his boss, Gordian (Silver), who then fires him.  When his equipment is confiscated and his partner is found dead in suspicious circumstances, he becomes fully aware that a cover-up of sorts is in operation. He tracks the signals to an isolated Mexican village where he meets another scientist (Lindsay Crouse) who has similar suspicions.  They are of the opinion that aliens are transmitting messages to aliens already on earth and he makes a startling discovery underneath the village...an underground alien lair who are speeding up the Greenhouse Effect in order to colonise the earth. Bad haircut, bad goatee, bad glasses, bad lines.  That is Charlie Sheen for the most part of this science fiction thriller; the same part that crawls along rather uneventfully making you wish you had chosen to watch Braveheart again.  However, suddenly the heat is on when the aliens become aware that their plan is under threat and Ziminski loses the specs and becomes a bit of a (unlikely) hero. For all its problems, The Arrival manages to create a small amount of tension as you start to wonder just who is on Ziminski's side and who is an alien.  When you think things are looking up, the film fizzles out to an uninspiring end though and it's another missed opportunity for Sheen.  The special effects are impressive yet subtle but they are not enough to warrant this movie a must see.

Charlie Sheen gives a dynamic performance for this type of film. combining the perfect balance of humor and seriousness,he's especially effective when he's all paranoid. Because he's Charlie Sheen he still manages to make us laugh. His chemistry with Teri Polo wasn't bad,they had there off moments, but mostly managed to make it work,and shocking enough he proved he can play an everyday action man,unlike Terminal Velocity where he felt out of place. Ron Silver is always a fine character actor and here is no different. He manages to be fitfully creepy while remaining unpredictable throughout. Teri Polo is OK as the love interest. While she Doesen't show off the charisma such as Meet The Parents, she's still quite adequate and did the job,even if she felt off at times. Lindsay Crouse has a very small part but managed to do a pretty decent job,her charisma with Charlie was spot on. Tony T. Johnson is a terrible kid actor,he's whiny while being annoying at the same time,I cannot state this enough if you're gonna act while being a kid show some talent!. Richard Schiff is the comic relief for the 1st part of the film,he managed to inject some laughs into the film.Bottom Line-The Arrival is a whole lot of fun it really is. Briskly paced with thrills galore,this is a Sci-Fi thriller you don't want to miss,it will keep you on the edge of you're seat i'm sure of it. Highly recommended.8/10 "},{"Title":"Totally Underrateed--One of the Best Sci Fi  Films","Date":"16 April 2006","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":" A totally underrated film, depicts an alien invasion, that is taking place.

More action-oriented science-fiction movies such as Terminator 2 and the Matrix are more entertaining by comparison and have better production values; but The Arrival works very well on its own terms and has its own imaginative ideas.  As a science-fiction fan and particularly an X-Files fan, this movie is indispensable to my movie collection.The plot setup is elegantly simple a radio astronomer (Charlie Sheen) and his partner (the always-good Richard Schiff) detect an intriguing extraterrestrial signal, and Sheen is then unexpectedly fired by his superior (Ron Silver), who after Sheen leaves destroys the recording of the signal--the first hint of a conspiracy, though not the first sign of trouble.The movie's memorable opening sequence shows a meteorological scientist (Lindsay Crouse) in a field of flowers and grass; then the camera soars upward to show the field surrounded by polar ice, near the North Pole (within 90 miles, she later explains).  This seems to indicate alarmingly rapid global warming; yet she receives no cooperation from anyone, not even her colleagues.Meanwhile, Sheen poses as a TV dish mechanic to create an array of dishes for his own personal use (the idea that he could do this is so amusing that it seems inconsequential whether it would actually be possible), and sets up his own observatory in his attic.  He detects a second signal identical to the first, but it originates from Earth!  This makes no sense, Sheen rightly argues, unless they're talking.  Heading to Mexico, he discovers that the radio station which led him there has been burned and destroyed the day before the atmosphere of conspiracy and paranoia is now overwhelming.The Mexico sequences are particularly good, adding beautiful scenery and convincing local color (Sheen chases his would-be assassin through a Day of the Dead procession, as people walk by holding up candles and a giant papier-mâché skeleton) to a story that is quite engrossing already.  Sheen learns that a mysterious corporation, Planet-Corp., is buying decrepit industrial plants in the Third World for some unknown purpose.SPOILERS AHEAD!  WATCH THE MOVIE FIRST, OR READ CAREFULLY!The alien facility that Sheen ultimately discovers underground is very well-conceived, with a huge circular structure sending giant balls of greenhouse gas (which are apparently fueled by car-sized canisters) up to the surface; the method Sheen employs to escape after being detected is also very imaginative, and appropriately unsettling as well.  The entire sequence is so suspenseful that tension remains even after Sheen escapes successfully.The movie then builds to an exciting, explosive climax at the radio observatory, where Sheen's determination to broadcast his evidence to the world leads to a showdown with the aliens.  Before the end, he learns who he can trust, and who he was wrong to trust.The Arrival is so absorbing and entertaining as a series of suspenseful situations and last-minute escapes that its real strengths, the performances and the direction, are easily overlooked.  I've seen Charlie Sheen often enough to know that his performance in this movie is one of his best his performances in Platoon and Wall Street are more compelling, of course, yet I would argue his perfect depiction of obsession and paranoia in The Arrival is his most entertaining and enthusiastic performance to date.  Casting him as a hotheaded astronomer was brilliant, since he's much more convincing in the role than I would have expected his character's emotions are completely believable, and he has an everyman quality that a Hitchcock scenario like this (an ordinary man caught in extraordinary circumstances) needs more than anything else.Teri Polo, best known for playing Ben Stiller's fiancee in Meet the Parents, also gives a convincing performance as Sheen's girlfriend, a woman exasperated with Sheen yet concerned for him, first because of his obsession with the signal and later because of his disturbing (though actually well-founded) paranoia.  Lindsay Crouse, because of her intelligent, perceptive face, seems perfectly cast as a scientist who, like Sheen, becomes obsessed with discovering the truth at whatever price.And Ron Silver is simply a great villain he's one of those actors who I don't see very often, but based on his performance in this movie I like him.  As the cold, enigmatic Phil Gordian, he manages in human form to exude as much menace as the aliens themselves; and when he finally reveals his true identity (which Sheen has already guessed), he expertly delivers the movie's most chilling line If you can't tend to your own planet, none of you deserve to live here.David Twohy's direction of his own script is so adroit that it's a shame his follow-up effort, Pitch Black, isn't nearly as stylish by comparison.  The Arrival displays many moments of inspired direction, such as a cut from the circle of the Earth to the circle of a radio dish (after the movie's first sequence concludes), and a distorted view of Ron Silver's silhouette (midway through the movie) that causes his head to appear alien-like--I have seen this same technique used in more recent films such as AI Artificial Intelligence and The Mothman Prophecies.  Such visual flourishes are probably not Twohy's original ideas, but I still appreciate the fact that he used them.The Arrival certainly didn't deserve to bomb in its theatrical release, but I suspect why it did I can't remember seeing a single TV ad for it back in the summer of 1996 (I did not know it existed until I saw it on HBO a year later), while I probably saw 100 TV ads for Independence Day during that same period of time.  Whether a movie's good or bad, it needs to be well-advertised to succeed.Isn't it a strange coincidence that cast members Richard Schiff and Ron Silver have appeared together on The West Wing, which stars Martin Sheen, Charlie's dad?  Sounds like a conspiracy to me.Rating 8  "},{"Title":"I liked it.","Date":"6 January 2003","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":"  I liked this movie.

They wouldn't come in gigantic spaceships (i.e Independence Day, V).  They would invade us in secret.  The summary of this film is that Aliens are raising our temperature through green house gas, which is melting the polar ice caps, and giving the planet 85 degree days in states where that is unusual.  Radio astronomer Zane Zaminski (Charlie Sheen) discovers a signal at the observatory he is working at, and he records part of the signal.  He later takes it to his boss Phil Gordian (Ron Silver).  He is skeptical, and he fires Zaminski.  He also destroys the tape.  So Zeminski creates a giant array to hear the signal through consumer satilite dishes.  He then hears the sound and after a few minutes he hears a Mexican radio station.  He later travels to Mexico, and discovers the aliens who frame him for murder.  I won´t spoil the rest of the plot.  The Aliens were wonderfully created, and hostile.  This film is mainly about paranoia and a man trying to convince the world that aliens are working against us, but no one will believe him.I think that this film portrays a realistic view of alien invasions.  Aliens wouldn´t invade us openly, they would work in secret.  They would undermine us from within, we would die off before anyone could discover that the aliens were behind it all.  These movies are much more frightening then films like Independence Day because no one knows that the aliens are here, unlike ID4 where everyone knew because they came in big spaceships.This film came out the same year as Independence Day, but didn´t fare as well at the box office.  I think it was a wonderfully acted movie, with a great plot, of suspense and it keeps you guessing to the end.. This film didn´t have as big of a budget as most Sci-fi films do, but they told an excellent story. I personally liked this film better than Independence Day.

It's original, well written, mysterious, has plot twists and remains tense and unpredictable right till the end.The power of the movie is that it's very well written. The movie starts of as a mysterious thriller, with science-fiction tendencies but half way through the movie, the movie turns into a full-blood science-fiction movie, completely with aliens and a plot to take over the world. The two halves blend in very well with each other with as a result a both mysterious as tense science-fiction movie, which plot twists make sure that the movie will leave you guessing right till the end and with also some well placed comedy in it. It also makes sure that the movie doesn't ever takes itself too serious, with as a result that the viewer can also more enjoy watching it.It's a very well written and directed movie, which makes this movie a well constructed and solid one. Especially the science-fiction should be able to appreciate the movie and its story. David Twohy shows that he knows how to handle the genre. Twohy is perhaps better known for his writing work, rather than his directed movies. It all the more adds to the fact that The Arrival is an underrated and not known well enough movie.If you could blame The Arrival for anything it would be that it was made a couple of years too early. The techniques and visual effects (though they certainly look great and acceptable) are already outdated a bit. OR you could of course also say that The Arrival was a movie that was ahead of its time. The intentions were all they already but the right powerful techniques to create weren't all available yet.Charlie Sheen does a good job at playing a sort of paranoid but always likable character. Ron Silver plays a great villainous like character and the movie also features Teri Polo in an early movie role. The movie has some good production values, with nice looking sets and good early computer graphics, even though it becomes obvious when watching this movie that it didn't had the highest budget available. Still it was amazing to find out that the movie cost only $5,000,000 to make. The movie certainly looks better and more expensive than that number would suggest. All the more reasons why they should let David Twohy direct more movies, with a budget like this one.It isn't always easy to always take the movie very serious and the movie has itself to blame for that, by putting in a bit too many coincidences and improbabilities. Further more, the movie should had perhaps the movie should had ended earlier. In other words The Arrival is not the best genre movie around but it nevertheless is certainly an underrated and under-appreciated one, that deserves to be seen, especially by the fans of science-fiction.8/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Close Encounters of the Sheen Kind","Date":"27 February 2003","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":"  THE ARRIVAL (1996) *** Charlie Sheen, Teri Polo, Ron Silver, Lindsay Crouse.

Unfortunately in the last forty to fifty minutes, it turns into something else. It is here where the sci- fi element kicks in, resulting is a climactic act that is not only derivative and (borrows too much from Close Encounters) but is simply too crazy and devoid of common sense to care for. I was left frustrated at the end, because for a while, it looked like this film was gonna amount to something. It doesn't.Zane Zaminski is an operator at S.E.T.I (search for extra terrestrial life) who one night records a forty-two second signal coming from another star. He is excited and overwhelmed, but the next morning, when he presents it to his boss, not only is he turned down, but his tape is destroyed, he is fired, and a few days later his partner is dead. Something is definitely being covered up. As Zane continues his rogue investigation, and soon it takes him down into Mexico, where something big could be waiting.I'll gladly admit that the film gets off to a great start, and it will certainly have the viewer hooked as plenty of questions are presented awaiting answers. The Pay off however is unsatisfying. It's not so much a matter of not being sufficient, but quite the contrary, it's too much to accept. imagination overtakes subtlety for the worse. the last third of the movie is an amalgamation of sloppy CGI, overdone performances, and coincidences/contrivances, that are so distracting it ruins my ability to sit back and enjoy the remainder of the film.There is no way The Arrival should've ended up like this. The film in it's entirely is middlingly effective, and I'm not sure I find it satisfactory enough to recommend it as what it wants to be, a sci-fi/thriller that is out of this world.

Zane Zaminski (cool first name, geeky last name) sports horn-rimmed glasses (geek!) and a goatee (cool!), has a muscle-bound physique (cool!), and is a radio astronomer looking for alien signals (geek!). He's tough, however (cool!), but paranoid (geek!).That's the fundamental flaw in _Arrival_. It tries so hard to present scientific research as something hip, trendy, cool, with-it--when real researchers don't care about image. Conversely, the film also suggests scientific research is for the delusional and deludes the public. It also falls prey to the current Hollywood fashion of a seemingly weak, shallow male lead character supported by a wise, insightful, somewhat superior woman.The plot comes off as a James Bond piece--minus 007--but with ET as the villain! Aliens bent on world domination. Silly ways of killing off nosy people who discover the aliens' plan (scorpions? Bathtubs?).The writers also wove in some silly subplot whereby NASA is deliberately making missions fail. The _Galileo_ probe's antenna mishap is cited, as is the initial problem with the Hubble Space Telescope. NASA solved these problems several years before this movie was even filmed. At least the writers had the sense not to cite the _Challenger_ catastrophe.I'm getting tired of Hollywood hacks who can't--or more likely WON'T--get it right when it comes to portraying science and ol' NASA. It's as if there's an 'us' (your average consumer) vs. 'them' (the over-educated geekheads who need to get REAL lives). I'm not a scientist, but I find Hollywood's running theme on this subject a continuing insult to my intelligence.Throw in silly background music, a seriously annoying kid, and some impossible occurrences (a nice alpine meadow at the North Pole), and you'll smell that turkey cooking.

With a little scientific ingenuity, he rigs up his own giant dish using the his neighbors' satellites. He traces the signal down to Mexico where he sees his own boss' face on another guy. The movie plays like a deep mystery that will keep your interest all the way until the ending. The effects are excellent as is the alien climate control terraforming plot. There are some truly frightening scenes including one that will have you checking your bed for the rest of your natural life. This is one of the movies I always cite when I attack House Of Games, you will not believe this is the same Lindsey Crouse that gave such a wooden reading in that overrated bore fest. She is excellent here as a scientist that is down in Mexico also, who runs into Zane, who is checking out the rapidly heating up earth. She is in the above scene I warned you about. The aliens frame Zane for her murder and from here on out the movie is like The Thing.You will never know who to trust or who is part of this conspiracy. The aliens have these little spherical steel balls that create artificial black holes that clean up all their nefarious deeds. Sheen excels in this movie, I liked him in Platoon but he really does this crazy, on the edge guy well. Ron Silver plays his creepy boss who throws him out but later we discover he is one of the leaders of the Alien TerraForming process. One of the best scenes, worth owning the movie for, is where Zane infiltrates one of their TerraForming factories and discovers what they really look like and this machine that puts our skin over their nasty looking bodies so they can pass for us. They have one weakness they hate the cold. Zane saves his group in the showdown with this helpful vulnerability. There is a little comedy but not much on the whole, it is one intense, relentless movie. I dare you to guess who is the alien in Zane's little group; hint, it is the last person you would suspect. The movie was released at the same time as Independence Day and was knocked out of theaters by that blockbuster.The movie is a little slow in the beginning. We spend a bit too much time with Char and Zane's boring domestic problems. Once we get down to Mexico, the movie is all go and no stop. The aliens can do this creepy thing with their knees allowing them to jump to ridiculous heights. The movie builds to an effects showdown at the very end that is extremely well done. The ending will surprise you and is well written. Even with the slow part, at the very beginning, this is a movie well worth owning. Crouse steals the movie in a little role; want to appreciate this director? Go watch the same actress in House Of Games and tell me directing doesn't matter. You will not believe this is the same actress. The intensity is the star of the movie; once it gets going, it grabs you. It plays the old he / she is an alien until you will be completely as paranoid as Zane. A Good Movie.

Having figured out that the problems are coming from a small Mexican Village he goes there, meets a female scientist, and between the two of them they discover that a small radio transmitter is actually the cover for a giant complex of Aliens preparing the world for an invasion by making the planet's climate more friendly for their species. Sheen is excellent in the film, as is Ron Silver, who was his boss and who seems to have a personal grudge against him. The Alien effects here are especially good. This film works well. If you like invasion films, this one is first class.

An exciting adventure of conspiracy, government cover-ups and possible alien life.The film teeters on the line between big-budget action flick and made-for-TV fodder, not unlike many of Charlie Sheen's other films (Beyond the Law, for example). Lacking in the actors and music, but making up for it in the amateur quality with which it was produced (that some might find alluring).Also, the actors are not at all attractive. The women Sheen meets are all very butch and look older than him by many years, and even he is sporting the worst haircut of his career (with a matching ugly beard). Hollywood would frown on this, but maybe there's something about the people being more realistic that might appeal to the viewers. I found it distracting, but that's just me.And who names a character Zane?The special effects are decent (again, assuming a low budget) and there are certain things I have never seen in a film before that I thought were somewhat clever. (I can't reveal what those things are because you'll want to be surprised on your own.)Ron Silver appears as Charlie Sheen's boss. Like always, Ron Silver is not only an acting god, he is evil incarnate. If you have seen Timecop, or especially Heat Vision and Jack, you know how evil Ron Silver can be. And in this film there's no Jack Black or Jean-Claude VanDamme to stop him!But if you see this film for no other reason, you'll want to see it for the bathtub scene. When Charlie gets attacked in the tub, the following moments will blow your mind. Seriously, it's like a M. C. Escher nightmare. You'll love it.Then again, it's a stupid movie and left me unfulfilled. So who knows?

Fortunately, this error was not included in the IPCC's report on climate change, but for every one person who reads a peer-reviewed journal article on climatology, there are thousands of people who saw this film. My concern is that these casual viewers could have been misled by the pretend science.Because the rise of atmospheric CO2 is central to the film's plot, I believe the writers had a duty to check the numbers - either make the total equal to the average of the several stations' data, or have the (fictional) stations all report data that averages to 12%. I don't think this was an accident - I believe the writers wanted to make our present situation (real life CO2 increases near 1%) seem scarier, so they deliberately misrepresented the global average by 12 times. If a real climatologist had published a paper built around an error of this type, they would be discredited and virtually unemployable in their field. This makes the film a propaganda piece, a deliberate attempt - way back in 1996 - to sell the global warming agenda with fraudulent, alarmist, inflated data.

Then it proceeds like Men in Black, without the second degree, bad guys want them to shut up about the Aliens... what else is new... But then you're in for a shocker... They want him to shut up about the Aliens because they ARE aliens 'in disguise!' oh wow!! Never saw that one coming... and then it ends like Invaders... human shaped Aliens attack the poor hero to prevent him from speaking the Truth...
