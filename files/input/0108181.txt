Sling Blade is my all time favorite movie.  I absolutely fell in love with it the first time I saw it and I still never tire of watching it.  This, on the other hand, is an entirely different take on the Karl Childers character.  While he is likeable and friendly in Sling Blade, he is intimidating and scary in Some Folks Call it a Sling Blade.  Also, I could not stand Molly Ringwold's version of the reporter.  She was bitter, hateful, and downright cold while the reporter in Sling Blade has a timid, sweet manner and is kind to Karl.  The ending left you with an odd feeling (yes, I know all of this was intentional) and made you wonder just WHY they were letting this menacing person out of the nervous hospital.  This is a very well done short.  The mood is dark, the setting is perfect, and Hickenlooper really seems to know what he is doing.  I just wasn't too crazy about his interpretation of the story.  Had I seen this before I saw the full-length version, I'm sure I would have enjoyed it a lot more. The video has a really cool behind the scenes featurette that is a must for fans of Sling Blade.  Oh, and thank you Billy Bob, for giving us YOUR interpretation of the story and telling it the way it was meant to be told.

It is probably pertinent to add that but for the success of this little independent number, the full length SLING BLADE most probably would never have gotten made three years later.Obviously a labor of love for creator Billy Bob Thornton. He presents a markedly different Karl Childers here. As retardedly backward but infinitely more menacing. It was probably on reflection that the character was made more marketable and sympathetic the second time around. Both films are such an absorbing focus on what is essentially a simple man turned (by dint of social expectation) feral by circumstances totally outside his control. The villain of the piece of course was Karl's father, played in a marvellous one-off cameo by Robert Duvall in the feature-length film.In SOME FOLKS CALL IT A SLING BLADE, the reporter is played by Molly Ringwald. Many seem not to have approved of her interpretation of the part, preferring the cutesy high-school reporter in the 1996 release. I thought she handled it well, after all she was dealing with a quite different Karl Childers.'Either way, this makes for a fascinating back-up to SLING BLADE. If anything, it adds to one's understanding of the man himself.

I have to disagree.  I enjoyed it much more than the reporter in the full-length version (which is one of the greatest films of all times.)  I didn't realize that the reporter was so weak in Sling Blade until I saw Some Folk.....  By the end of the interview with Karl, she (Ringwald) 'gets it' - she understands the horrific conditions that Karl endured, and why he did what he did,  and she shows it, simply by the expressions on her face.  I did not find this Karl any more menacing than the Karl of Sling Blade - I think it does show more the fear he has of leaving the safety and relative comfort of the hospital.  Imagine how it would be if being in a hospital is a better situation than your only memories of life outside.  Long time prison inmates describe it all the time.  This is a magnificent piece - where less is definitely more.  I loved it.

I love the opening scene where a patient runs down the corridor bare-butt naked and an orderly races after him.          Charles Bushman always sat down beside Karl Childers and told him tales of his run-ins with cross-dressers and prostitutes; two female journalists, Teresa Tatum and Frances, were coming to conduct an interview on Karl, because after 25 years he was being released. They had mixed feelings about the whole thing. At the sanitatium, they meet Gerry Woolridge, the cureator of the place. He tells them a little back history on Karl, like how his parents believed deeply in the Bible and that they sinned when they had Karl. They even told him that!          Karl comes in and talks about why he's in the sanitarium and how he had murdered Jesse Dixon for manhandling his mother, then murdered his mother for, well, not showing proper gratitude when her son came to her aide.          That's basically about it. Three years later, Billy Bob Thornton directed the motion picture based on this short, Sling Blade, which starts out exactly like this, and features Karl's further travels and people he interacts with. And the character of Gerry Woolridge changes from a skinny, balding four-eyes into an older man.So what can I say about Some Folks Call It a Sling Blade? I'm used to Sling Blade, but the information in this explains more in Sling Blade, which I think is a great movie! So, in conclusion, check them both out!- "},{"Title":"Re Molly Ringwald","Date":"4 June 2012","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Short, Drama, Thriller","Review":" All else aside I found her more credible as a journalist (the actress in the feature was more the schoolgirl, which may have been intentional); Ringwald's performance did more to make me wonder at the end of the film just what she would write for her paper. Would that have been a distraction as we watched Carl's re-entry? I don't recall any followup to that in the feature.Altogether this was fascinating, not to be compared head-to-head with the full-length film which has justly become an American classic. Films like Sling Blade can stand with the best of what is often considered superior European cinema.

The question one might ask is who has been wronged most? You simply can not lock up a child in a shed for years and expect it to act rationally. George Hickenlooper does well to restrict his staging to a cool minimum. The actors get more space that way. Molly Ringwald, J.T.Walsh and Billy Bob Thornton are equally good in this gripping short. Although I'm not certain whether I agree with Hickenlooper's choice of two-shot for the interview scene -B.B.Thornton shot the same scene almost completely in close up for his SLING BLADE; and to good effect- his decision to use black and white photography was a wise one. This kind of film is not a dime a dozen, it should be treasured.

The director is Emmy winner George Hickenlooper and Thornton's co-stars are Golden Globe nominee Molly Ringwald and Emmy nominee J.T. Walsh. The latter is the only one of the trio who returned for the full feature movie that was loosely based on this short film. Hickenlooper and Walsh died very early. Thornton went on to win an Oscar for Sling Blade in the Screenplay category beating the dominant movie from that year The English Patient.Anyway, this short black-and-white film here did not impress me too much. I cannot say that this somehow motivated me to watch the full feature film. The performances weren't too memorable and I have to say I did not find the story really great or think that Thornton's character could make it into my all-time favorite villain list. He plays a murderer in a prison / insane asylum who is paid a visit by a journalist who wants to interview him. There is a problem with the journalist being a woman early on, but none of this was really a factor during the actual interview, which was really more of a monologue. All in all, I hoped this would be better. Not recommended.

Now, after about 25 years in prison, this is the day of his release. Karl seems to have a mind that works well, but his viewpoints often seem odd. If you live long enough and observe carefully, there really are people like Karl.His story and impending release from prison have stirred up local interest, and local reporter, Molly Ringwald as Teresa Tatum, has asked if she can interview him. She is cautioned, he isn't comfortable with women, he doesn't like to have questions asked, and the fluorescent light bother him. So Karl and Teresa are in a darkened room, on opposite sides, and he begins to speak, telling his story in his own odd delivery and choice of words. This is a very short film, B & W and just under 25 minutes, but what we see supports the story exactly. Particularly good is the lighting. Now it makes me want to see 'Sling Blade' again.

That's because this short film was much of the basis of SLING BLADE. It was based on Billy Bob Thornton's stage production and the success of this short led to financing that allowed for SLING BLADE to be made. In other words, first it was a show, then a short and then a full-length film.If you are worried about SOME FOLKS CALL IT A SLING BLADE being too much like the full-length film, then you will be mistaken. While the same essential character stars in each (Karl Childers), the scope and purpose of the film is very different. In the 25 minute version, you don't even see Childers leave the psychiatric hospital. In other words, it ends where the full-length film begins. So, in essence, it's a prequel and the focus is very different. The emphasis of SOME FOLKS is really on the original crime itself as well as his apparent inability to care for himself because he is so institutionalized and low-functioning.In addition to it being a prequel, of sorts, another big difference is the female reporter (Molly Ringwald) who interviews him just prior to his discharge--an interesting plot device, as she plays the voice of society. She is outraged that such a killer could be released to the world AND she once she meets him, she is the voice of concern about what is to become of this human being.Overall, an exciting and exceptional short that is a must-see for anyone who liked SLING BLADE. Excellent acting, direction, cinematography---you name it!

However, now that the narrative has been expanded into a full-length movie, it works more like an extra for those interested in seeing the development of the character over time.Billy Bob Thornton's imagining of this character is honestly one of his crowning achievements as an actor and someone working in movies. Sling Blade is a modern classic, and he portrays the character so well that having an earlier short like this is nice because the audience gets a chance to spend more time with him than just the feature-length movie.However, this short isn't produced nearly as well as the movie, and that doesn't necessarily have to do with the fact that it was a smaller budget, more limited production. The acting isn't all around as well-done, even by familiar actors we've seen before. The directing is kind of sloppy and only enough visual to pull off a narrative we can get into. All in all, Billy Bob Thornton is about the only reason to watch this film.There's also a sense that, though he had written it, Thornton hadn't yet completely figured out what he wanted this character to be. Afterwards he returned, and afterwards he created Sling Blade. This short seems destined to always be overshadowed by the majesty of the later work. I can live with that.--PolarisDiB "},{"Title":"feels like a documentary","Date":"23 August 2001","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Short, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  I did not see Sling Blade and knew nothing about this film.

Maybe it was the snotty, hands-on-hips, childish performance by Molly Ringwald that bothered me here.  Or maybe it was the horribly stereotyped view of the residents of what, in the full-length, Karl calls the nervous hospital.  Yes, the short strongly resembles the opening of the full-length film, but I think it's weaker in many ways.  The cinematography is better in the feature film (and I have no problem with black and white); Molly Ringwald's performance really sours the whole 25 minutes; and left on its own, this opening really implies things I don't like.  Rather than actually speculating on how Karl will deal with living unsupervised, it seems to portray all the residents of the hospital as soulless victims.  I'm not sure what I'm supposed to feel at the end of the film.  At the end of Sling Blade, I felt I had gotten to know a man.  At the end of Some Folks Call It a Sling Blade, I just thanked my lucky stars that Billy Bob Thornton decided to direct a version of it himself.

T. Walsh's rape stories. The only real surprise is how quickly it is over. (25 brisk minutes) Unlike other viewers I really didn't notice a menacing nuance in this version. It really seemed almost note for note. One might rightly wonder why this short simply didn't appear as an extra on the Sling Blade proper disc. The included behind the scenes docs explain that pretty clearly.The first doc is of little interest except to see J.T. Walsh chain smoke and hear director George Hickenlooper expound on how he likes short films and how European it is to make one. The second doc proves all that art for art sake stuff a lie.Hickenlooper shows very lengthy clips from three of his features. The first Heart of Darkness a Filmmakers Apocalypse looked interesting. Even more interesting is how Hickenlooper got a directing credit even though Coppola's wife shot all the footage. The other two features the Killing Box and the Low Life look awful. The Killing box is a vampire civil war hybrid from which Hickenlooper removed the vampires and the Low Life seems like one of those self conscious auto-biographical films that comes out of Project Greenlight.The real treat is hearing Hickenlooper completely trash his former friend Billy Bob Thorton basically describing him as an unstable maniac. Since Thorton went of to fame and fortune and Oscar gold. (Hickenlooper even attacks Billy Bob's eligibility to win an Oscar for best adapted screenplay) and Hickenlooper was not asked to direct one can only assume a little payback was in order during this record straightening.Even funnier Hickenlooper accuses Thorton of trying to turn the short into an audition reel (Why else would you do a short?) while in the next breath explaining he was going to use it to shop a feature film. (And all of this in one of the most self centered promotional docs I have ever seen. It's like a childhood film retrospective at a sweet sixteen party.)
