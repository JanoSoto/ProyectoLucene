Does this film capture the quaint Cravenesque sci-fi ambiance of the first movie?  Of course not.  Nor does it capture the dreary, macabre vision of the Alan Moore comic books.  What we have here is a perfect lovely late 80's fantasy/comedy about a seven foot plant man.  If you look at it objectively, perhaps your vision would not be so skewed.Now, you may think that I (Daniel Emery Taylor, featured in the film as Darryl) might be slightly biased.  I assure you, it's a possibility. However, you must know that the movie was filmed in fun and meant in fun. From every one-line groaner to every silly sexual innuendo, it was all planned and perpetrated.  To see how serious we were, take a look at the video/DVD cover art.To give a summary of the movie  Swamp Thing returns to thwart Dr. Arcane's plot for immortality.  It's a basic semi-superhero movie plot.  From there, Swampy falls in love with Arcane's daughter, has some great fighting sequences, comes through a faucet, drives a jeep, takes pictures with these two ADORABLE kids (and they're really terrific actors, too ... honesty!), and blows stuff up.If you're a fan of B-movies, as I am, you're likely to enjoy this.  There are plenty of laughs, both intentional and unintentional.  The acting is what you would expect, and the effects are really quite good for its day. This is not a movie you have to ponder or concentrate on.  Its subtle social messages and troubled postmodern imagery will not haunt you for days. It's simple fun.

This is just such a sequel! If you look up my review for Swamp Thing, you'll see that I didn't care to much for it. This, on the other hand, was great! They decided to go with the over-the-top comic-book style that the original skirted, which made the movie a lot more enjoyable. The effects improved greatly, the creatures in this actually looked like some effort was put into them! I especially liked the updated Swamp Thing costume, made him look a lot better and more intimidating. Louis Joudan was thankfully back, and his character, Dr. Anton Arcane, was even better than ever! His step-daughter Abby, played by Heather Locklear, was one of many great comic relief characters, along with the bumbling head of security named Gunn, and many others. The side plot with two kids trying to get Swampy's picture was a tad annoying, but it had it's amusing moments.

Dick Durock, once again, brings far more class to the role of the Swamp Thing than the writing would seem to allow. And Louis Jordan, while completely unlike the Arcane seen in the comics in every way, is deliciously brilliant in every villainous role he's every played (see Octopussy as an example of a brilliant Jordan performance in an otherwise uninspired movie).Plus, what's not to love about Heather Locklear? Sure, she's missing Abby's Transylvanian accent from the comic. Sure, she portrays Abby as far more airheaded than she was in the comic. And sure, she's not wearing comic-book Abby's trademark jean cutoffs and read shirt. But this is Heather Locklear, folks, and she more than makes up for it every time she smiles. (Hey, I'm reviewing a corny movie...what better way to do so than to make corny statements?)Rumors abound that we might someday see a new Swamp Thing film, this time built around the landmark origin story Alan Moore brought to the character. We can only hope. In the meantime, both Swamp Thing films (while hardly high cinema) are still great B-movie fun.

Meanwhile in Los Angeles his stepdaughter Abigail (Heather Locklear) decides to visit him to find out more about her late mother & the events surrounding her sudden death. It turns out that Abigail has the exact genetic make-up that Arcane needs to complete his experiments & give himself eternal life. Arcane also needs a sample of Swamp Thing's (Dick Durock) DNA to complete the process but getting a sample isn't going to be as easy as Arcane hoped for as Swamp Thing sets out to put an end to Arcane's evil experiments...Directed by Jim Wynorski whom I consider one of the worst genre filmmakers of all time I have to say that I really liked The Return of Swamp Thing & for my money just about the best thing Wynorski has ever done (which isn't saying much in itself). A direct sequel to Wes Craven's Swamp Thing (1982) it is never actually explained how Arcane survived the events during the climax of the original although it turns out he is suffering from the process that saved him which forms the basis of the plot as he sets out to find a cure & doesn't care how many people he kills to do just that. Based on the dark Gothic DC comic book character the script by Neil Cuthbert & Grant Morris hasn't got too much to it & is rather simplistic & underdeveloped but is good fun all the same & you suspect that what the production team were aiming for, a good solid entertaining light hearted fun comic book superhero flick which I think it succeeds at being but like most things in life it's down to personal opinion. At a little over 90 minutes it's relatively short, it moves along like a rocket & I was never bored with it which is always a good thing to be able to say. There are one or two half decent action set-pieces but considering the production team had a budget smaller than the Wes Craven original you could say they worked minor miracles. The character's are fun although not particularly deep, the dialogue is often amusing & packed full of one-liners & doesn't take itself too seriously either with Locklear's character referring to the TV show T.J. Hooker (1982 - 1986) in which she starred. All in all much, much better than I expected & a film that I really liked. Keep watching after the end actor credits as the two kids get an extra little scene.Director Wynorski does a decent job & the film looks reasonably good although you can tell there wasn't much money with which to make it. One very impressive aspect of The Return of Swamp Thing is the special make-up effects which are of a very high standard. The Leechman in particularly looks great although he disappears about halfway through, there's a elaborate Cockroachman & an Elephantman. The Swamp Thing suit is also much better than seen in the original, it's far more leafy & slimy & more representative of a what a half man half Georgia swamp creature may look like. The Dr. Rochelle mutation at the end also looks good but is dispatched too easily by Swamp Thing & doesn't put up much of a fight. There are some good fight scenes as well along with a couple of impressive explosions.Technically the film is good, it's well made with the already mentioned special effects impressing. Shot in Savannah in Georgia. The acting is pretty camp & over-the-top but the material demands it, Louis Jordan is somewhat restrained, Dirk Durock's voice was dubbed in post while Heather Locklear looks nice enough.The Return of Swamp Thing is a film which I admit that I throughly enjoyed, that's my opinion & I am sticking with it. Followed by the made-for-TV live action series Swamp Thing (1990 - 1993) & the short lived made-for-TV animated series Swamp Thing (1991).

However he has plans for her, which involves stealing her DNA to achieve immortality. Finding out she escapes into the swamp where she is rescued by Dr. Alex Holland, who now finds himself half-plant, half-man known as Swamp-Thing. For better or worse, he camped it up and played it for laughs. However that's not taking anything away from it, while it can get silly. It still was rather enjoyable and the make-up FX (involving the mutants) was very well pulled off. The opening sequences involving comic inserts and Creedence Clearwater Revival's Born in the Bayou used as its theme song do set the mood. I think it actually starts off rather strongly, then if anything kind of falls away when Swamp Thing and Heather Locklear's character come together (the sweet love-story) mid-way through. The script is very tongue-in-cheek and the performances are rather self- knowing&#x85; even Dick Durock as Swamp Thing. Louis Jourdan returns as Dr. Arcane and does a wonderful job bringing this sly character to life. Locklear is looking great, but her character was somewhat an annoyance. The support fair better with the likes of Sarah Douglas and Ace Mask. Wynorski doesn't hold back as he eccentrically seems to pile on the set- pieces and effects with very little story holding it together, but he sure does make it feel like a live-action comic strip with some imaginative brushes, bang-up action and good use of the atmospheric swamp terrain.

His life, however, will be short-lived unless he is able to reverse his cell degeneration. Up to this point, his experiments have yielded only horribly disfigured mutants. Fortunately for the Doctor, his step daughter, Abby (Heather Locklear), arrives to confront him about her mothers death. With her DNA, Arcane may be able to save himself. But, lurking nearby is Swamp Thing - Dr. Arcane's nemesis who is intent on stopping him.- I've seen this movie at least a half a dozen times. With each viewing, I want it to be good. Although bits and pieces are enjoyable, overall it's just not a very good movie. For the most part The Return of Swamp Thing fails at being an action movie, it fails at being a sci-fi movie, and it fails at being a horror movie. Some of the acting, particular that of Monique Gabrielle, is noticeably wooden. I doubt that Gabrielle has ever delivered a line that sounded natural. Some of the special effects, particularly a few of the mutants, are anything but special. Many of the plot points can be seen from a mile away. For example, when we are introduced to Abby, we are told that she's the kind of person who prefers plants to people. Gee, I wonder who will be her love interest in the movie? - The movie does achieve a little success, however, at being a comedy. Some of the lines are genuinely funny. For example, when Swamp Thing reminds Abby that their budding relationship will be hampered because he's a plant, her response That's okay, I'm a vegetarian. Not great, but it does bring a smile to my face. Another scene that I'm fond of involves Jourdan poking a little fun at himself. Jourdan's pet parakeet happens to be named Gigi. Jourdan sings a little song to Gigi that's a take-off of the songs in what may be his most famous movie, Gigi.- As I had seen this movie several times before, on this occasion I watched with the commentary on Image's DVD.

The plot (what there is of it) could be summed up in about two sentences. Mad scientist seeks immortality but to find it he needs the blood of shapely step-daughter Heather Locklear, and avoid the vengeful wrath of Swamp Thing. Everything else is just surplus to requirements &#150; in other words, a typical sequel.I watched this movie and mostly thought how well it would work as a comedy play, with poor special effects, two-dimensional characters, pantomime villains, mediocre dialogue and acting and a plot you could see coming a mile away.

He went on to write (among other things) the comic From Hell which is being made into a movie with Johnny Depp, Ian Holm and Heather Graham, later this year.Anyway, back to Swamp Thing. A pre-Alan Moore film of it was made, and after he made the comics popular, they decided to make a sequel. Did they use any of his ideas or style? Or did they decide to make a campy, supposedly-funny mess out of it? Well, you decide.Dont even get me started on the problems with this. The characters look all wrong. They feel all wrong.

It's horrible.","Date":"8 August 1999","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Sci-Fi, Horror, Comedy","Review":"  There's a reason I watched this movie. As a child I went on vacation abouts of Disney World and MGM Studios. At one of those I saw none other than our very own Swamp Thing in the flesh, or should I say, in the vegetation? *titter* Anyways, there was a film crew there and a crowd had gathered. The part I enjoyed was that director had to frequently tell the crowd - via his megaphone - to be quiet; I imagine he had to do this all day as it was pretty busy at the theme park in question. Poor shmoe. I thought this might be the movie that I had witnessed. That, at least, would have been neat. I was wrong. Apparently, there was a Swamp Thing TV show, which is what I must have seen.As it stands, there are only two good things about this movie one, if you can sit through the entire thing, they play CCR through the end credits; two, the name of the guy who plays the Swamp Thing is Dick Durock. Now, should I ever need one, I've got myself a good porn name.Aside from that, this movie is bad. They seem to have spent their entire budget on explosives and monster costumes. Unfortunately, once they got them, they didn't know what to do with them. Don't get me wrong, the costumes and explosions still looked fake and ill-timed but there WERE a lot of them. The acting, of course, was horrible, as was the comic relief. The action scenes lacked any blood or gore, which lead me to believe this was a children's film, except for the blatant sexual innuendoesMay we have sex now, Swamp Thing?No, I'm a monster.Oh, come on. Pleeease?Oh, okay. Take this. He then proceed to rip a piece of celery off his body and hand it to the girlThat's not an exact quoting but you get the idea. Do you parents of the 80s get some kind of kick out of raunchy aspects of children's films that are above the heads of your kids? What's the matter with you people?This movie is void of entertainment value. If you ever feel the need to rent a movie about a large, green, muscular, good-hearted man with a Clark Gable-isque voice, go rent the original (unintentionally campy) or, better yet, The Toxic Avenger (intentionally cheesy).

This one goes in the opposite direction and ends up being almost a parody and it is not even an okay movie.  In fact, it is horrible.  Well that is not fair the first few minutes were at least tolerable as Swamp Thing battles this other creature, but after that the movie is just about unwatchable.  Louis Jordan is the only one back from the first one I think (not sure if it is the same guy playing Swamp Thing) and Heather Lockler plays the love interest and the lame jokes come fast and furious.  Most of the time they are not very good, in fact, I do not remember laughing at any of them.  I also remember this movie dragging quite a bit.  You will check your watch and wonder when it is going to be over.  After it all you get your lame ending and then you can let out a breath and be thankful that it is finally over.

Of course it is up to the titled character (Dick Durock) to save the day. Also along for the ride is Jourdan's super-hot step-daughter (Heather Locklear) who ends up falling in love with Durock (I guess there is always hope for those who may not have the best reflections in a mirror). Could it be possible that Jourdan would sacrifice Locklear for his plan to work? Another disgusting mess with plenty of science-fiction meanderings and dumb characters galore (military thugs Monique Gabrielle and RonReaco Lee leading the way). The seven year difference between installments did nothing to help this lame duck as the movie barely made a dent at the box office and ended up drowning with critics. Turkey (0 stars out of 5).

Of course, only Sawm Thing can save the day. While it's true this film is nowhere near the greatness of the original, it's also not as horrid as some have suggested. OK, not by much. Yes, it's rather corny and the 'Comic relief' kids are annoying and drop the grade a bit (my apologies to Daniel Taylor in advance, as I know he's on this site).However, it's ALWAYS nice to see Monique Gabrielle, even if this is one of the few times she keeps her clothes on.DVD ExtrasCommentary by director Jim Wynorski; Promo reel (5 min); 6 TV-spots; 2 PSA's for (the law breaking) Greenpeace; and Photo galleryMy Grade C- "},{"Title":"a pointless sequel(?)","Date":"2 March 2006","Score":"0 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Sci-Fi, Horror, Comedy","Review":" This movie is dopey and pointless. What particularly bothered me was that in the original SWAMP THING, Louis Jourdan was the bad guy. In the end, he was transformed into a hideous monster and ultimately was destroyed by Swamp Thing. However, in this sequel, of sorts, once again Louis Jourdan returns as the bad guy. Now, he might be a really resilient guy but this is ridiculous!! Why couldn't they have at least gotten a different actor so as to maintain some continuity? Regardless, this is just a re-hash of old stuff and offers nothing new of necessary. The original was fresh and mildly interesting--this film is just an old re-tread. "},{"Title":"Awful! Awful!
