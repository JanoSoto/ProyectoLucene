It was litterally the most insulting, inane dialogue I have ever been treated to in a movie.Props arrive next in an extremely close second.  The 35 Million dollars used to make this film must have been used on late night taco runs, because the quality of the props is abyssmal.  The prized artifact of the movie looks like it fell out of a box of cracker jack, while some of the armor and backgrounds are straight out of the Bargain Bin at your local toy store. Better attempts at fantasy film making have been shot on camcorders across the globe in people's back yards.The acting was terrible all around.  The few, and I mean FEW, attempts at serious dialogue were crushed by the worst script ever.  The only remotely cool character in the entire proceeding was Demadar, who was still pretty goofy.  I guess if I was 8 or so, I might have thought he was creepy.  The notably great actors in this film should have balked the moment they saw the script/quality of filming, and their presence on the screen only adds to the insult.Th producers of this movie should be ashamed of themselves.  Hundreds of thousands of loyal D&D fans have been waiting for over 25 years for a great, inspiring movie from their hobby.  D&D has a prodigious level of material written about it, and any one of it's 100+ books would have made a better movie if read aloud by Pee Wee Herman.This horror show of a movie will no doubt ensure the demise of a great hobby in the public eye for at least the next 10 years.  Any potential fan of the game will be unable to forget this awful movie experience.  Consider yourself warned, and never, EVER see this movie.

Jeremy Irons was especially shocking, his performance was very pathetic and flat, as if this would be a bad movie for three year olds. That was not acting, that was a torment ! I cried every time he appeared on the screen.Thora Birch was also far, far below her level in 'American Beauty', obviously unable to tell how one should put a little life into her bad dialogue and flat character, and somehow even thinking that that was her own fault.If at all, the thief Snails (Marlon Wayans from Scary Movie) had quite some good moments in his slapstick scenes, the only good moments in the whole movie. Unfortunately they don't last long. Wayans seems to have a talent to shine even in the worst movies, however.The performance of the main actor was also bad. His dull and cheap sunnyboy behavior really nerved me, and I saw absolutely no reason for his 'being special', but far more for 'being untalented'.The effects where better than the story, but really not that exciting either.Some people say fantasy is about stereotypes, but that doesnt mean you can forget all rules how to make up a good story ! This story was not worth getting on the screen. This story was also not worth getting such good actors and effects. This story was nothing but crap !And I can't believe that Jeremy Irons and Thora Birch are such bad actors, they have proven they can do far, far better ! I can only guess it must have been the director who forced them to do such bad performances.Definitely not recommended for anyone except maybe children below ten. Oh wait, they're not allowed ? No loss. "},{"Title":"Surprising!

With the D&D movie, I expected a dumb, camp, action flick, and I received something that was so unexpectedly foul that it caused me to write the world about it. How did this movie even get made? Now, I play D&D ( admit it, y'all do too ) so don't fault me for 'not understanding the genre'. The movie had too many characters, some of which disappear inexplicably during the course of the movie. The plot made no sense; the twists at the end came from nowhere. And don't get me started on Marlon Wayans's character - you mean to tell me that in the fantasy world of D&D, a black man can't get a role other than the Black Buddy Cop stereotype?Pure crap, plain and simple.

The only way it is (slightly) better than that movie is the (very) occasional good set or effect.I could write for hours about what's wrong with this movie, but this is what comes to mind immediately(1) The horrible acting. I honestly can't understand why someone so talented as Jeremy Irons would be going so over the top. It's clear, however, that he isn't enjoying himself in the movie, so maybe he's getting revenge against the movie by acting so terriblyThe most annoying performance goes to Marlon Wayans. His shrieking, cowardly character uncomfortably brings up images of stereotypes from the 1930s. At least he doesn't say Feet, do your stuff! - though he sure comes close.(2) The bright, glitterly look of every scene. When you think of sword and sorcery, I think we all think of things rough and with grit. Not here.(3) The movie constantly rips off from other (better) movies, most notably from the four STAR WARS movies(4) The characters. Why the hell were the dwarf and elf in this movie? They could easily have been written out without consequence. And the main thief hero is one of the blandest heroes I've ever seen in the movie.(5) Virtually all the special effects, sets etc. are AWFUL. Sometimes they look even worse than those seen on the Xena and Hercules shows! (Though those two shows at least have the excuse of having lower budgets - and they make up for the cheap effects by having better scripts, characters, and acting!)(6) And speaking of scripts...thos script is terrible! Mainly it's because the story itself hardly makes any sense!

Breaking into the magic school to steal they are captured by Marina but, when her master is killed, the thieves find themselves drawn into an attempt by the evil Profion to use the power of a lost sceptre to seize control from Empress Savina, who is trying to reform and make all men equal.It is hard to really judge the plot of this film because I'm sure it could have been a rollicking, engaging swords & sorcery affair and it is only the delivery here that has turned it into a massive, insulting pile of rubbish. The way that the characters have to explain every single action in BIG LETTERS for the audience was something that grated on me and took me from thinking of it as lazy writing to finding it offensive that the writers thought I was too stupid to follow the story myself. Instead of being a strong narrative the film is just a basic adventure for kids, with effects and noise to keep them distracted. As such it is still only so-so because even children might struggle to care about the unimpressive CGI backgrounds and action set pieces. It'll please the very undemanding genre fan under 12 years old but unlikely many others.The characters are another major failing &#150; who thought that writing obnoxious, annoying or smug characters across the leads would cause an audience to be engaged by them? With this to work with, is it any wonder that the cast are roundly poor? Whalin must have thought his luck was in when he landed this role, but he messes it up with a performance that shows he is out of his depth and unsure of himself. McLellan is bland and quite irritating for the majority of the film but her faults pale in comparison to a trio of performances that stick in the mind as the worst of the film. Irons hams it up with all the carelessness of a pro who knows an easy payday when he sees it &#150; he is hilariously terrible at times. Payne's blue lipstick seems to have affected his voice and every line is delivered as a sneer &#150; it is never menacing and quickly becomes tiresome. However the worst performance is form, surprise surprise, Wayans who made me understand what Spike Lee's Bamboozled was getting at. He is a shrieking, mugging ethnic clich√© &#150; even worse than he usually does and even more annoying. The odd cameo from O'Brien or Baker do nothing to stop the rot and the cast add to the impression that this was cheaply made without much love.Overall a poor film that will probably only appeal to kids. The plot is badly delivered and the effects are not as impressive as director Solomon was clearly banking on them being. The cast are lost in the middle of it all and not a single on of them gives a performance that you could call good, all in all producing a pretty poor attempt at a blockbuster.

Now as a rule I don't always take note of reviews of films, even if they are bad, as certain films can be bad & still quite enjoyable, even if the acting & plot are okay. Unfortunately, this is not only all the above, but also pretty tiresome & downright tedious as well.The main unknown (to me anyway) leading threesome are all dreadful & from this showing awful actors as well. Justin Whalin is just laughable & one of the worst heroes in a long while. Probably since Val Kilmers appalling performance in The Saint. Zoe Mclellan is pretty enough (which probably explains away her deficiencies amongst other reviewers) but is still dreadful. The worse though is Marlon Wayons, whose performance is not only awful & completely unfunny, but also of a racist nature. The rest of the actors are also bad, but at least the likes of Jeremy Irons, Bruce Payne & Thora Birch, know they are only slumming it, & are at least decent actors if the material is there.The plot is also weird & ridiculous, with no explanation of what is going on, & the upsetting thing was that the poor dragons couldn't have snacked on the lot of them, which would of at least made it a happy ending, for us & the dragons anyway. If you want to see a well acted & well made fantasy film watch Lord of the Rings instead.

There is no acting, no plot. The very spirit of D&D is completely trashed. One of the worst parts is this Wayans guy who plays a Brooklyn rogue wannabe which is pointlessly killed in the middle of the movie. The characters are hardly believable (how stupid must the two rogues be) not to mention the entire action and party (Only you were meant to pass).

And I knew it wasn't going to do justice to the D&D game, but I was open-minded to the effort. But good lord, this might be the worst movie I've ever seen.Lots of people have shredded this movie in a lot of ways, so I've got little new to contribute to the mass lynching. But three quick summary points The acting was embarrassing - the Jeremy Irons was clearly chewing up the set with a bad Christopher Lee impression, and Thora Birch really, really wanted to be elsewhere. Whichever Wayans got drunk enough to sign this contract was cringe-worthy, and the best thing he did was die (although he took too long getting about it).The special effects were hilariously bad. The CGI for the sets was a distant second to Wolfenstein 3D, and anything involving 'magic' could've been better accomplished with a handful of colored yarn.Finally, the plot was UTTERLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE. Our heroes are sent to find the Rod of Thingummy, because the Empress is about to lose her Whatchamacallit. As they mosey along, everyone says 'good lord, don't find the Rod of Thingummy, it's a horrible evil'. In fact, the only person that could be benefited by the Rod of Thingummy is Lord Sinister Big Bad. Still, our idiot heroes keep on trooping around, trying to find the Rod of Thingummy. THEN, the Empress doesn't even LOSE the Whatchamacallit in the first place, so there's NO need for the Powers of Good to get the Rod of Thingummy anyway. BUT THEY KEEP GOING. So, inevitably, they get the Rod of Thingummy (more warnings about 'don't find it' coming in along the way), and HEY, the BAD GUY STEALS IT FROM THEM.Furthermore, that's what turns the tide of the war! The Empress was WINNING until our stupid heroes find the Rod and give it to the bad guys, what's up with that? Champions of the Realm?! They're idiots, and are personally responsible for the destruction of the city.Which is, may I add, a good thing, as whatever Commodore 64 was building the cityscape graphics was clearly overheating at that point anyway.Avoid at all costs.

Anyone who praises this rubbish as a good film needs their head examined, and I personally thought even the plethora of cgi effects were pretty lame!

As we opened the DVD, an aura of evil emanated from it, and although we noticed the clear evil coming from this DVD, we were expecting the best movie ever created. However the moment the screen turned on, our cousin's friend slinked away, muttering something about the apocalypse. What followed was quite possibly the worst movie experience of my life. After this horrid event, I didn't watch a movie for about 6 mouth's, and I was too scared to turn on the TV, thinking that at any time the ear splitting screech of snails was to come upon me.

His lackey Damodar (Bruce Payne) is blue-lipped and black-armored (therefore evil) and exudes all the menace of an overripe eggplant.  Thora Birch - wonderful in 'American Beauty' - looks like she was blackmailed into this role, as she's completely catatonic throughout the film, giving her Empress Savina (the wholesome representation of all things Good) zero energy and appeal.How about those heroes?  Marlon Wayans (Snails, the thief) is completely annoying, offering nothing to the proceedings; Justin Whalin (Ridley, another thief) - the nominal hero - is a goofball who'd be outclassed by the cast of Baywatch; and Zoe McLellan (Marina, the mage) is the only one who seems to even try to keep to a thematic element of fantasy, though she's in way over her head.   'Dungeons & Dragons' is a complete mess and a complete waste of your time.

Yet they decided to invent a new story and it shows.If you are a fantasy fan and sober when watching this, you'll probably start to cry. Then again, if you're drunk you'll laugh your socks off (I did).The makers have tried their best to do a proper fantasy movie. They must have (this is how you can tell if they had tried to make a comedy, the movie would actually be funny at some point).The film was supposed to be a high-money production but you really can't tell it except for the computer animation. Everything is made of plastic and the costumes are very cheap-looking.Marlon Wayans' appearance is something unspeakable. It's hard to tell which is worse, the acting or the script. The only one in the film who knows how to act is Jeremy Irons who destroys his reputation quite effectively by taking part in this waste of film. Apparently in desperate need of money, he should have at least used a false name and a face-covering helmet PIf you can see this for free, I recommend. A true do-not-do-movies-like-these specimen. Just don't pay for it!------------------------------------------------A few nags, the whole list would be so long nobody wants to read itThe plot is filled with holes you can drive a bus through- A library filled with priceless magic books isn't guarded in any way, even with *magic*. Of course not. You just come in through the window.- People making their living off thieving have less basic skills in it than my grandmother.- The terrifying commando group hunting down the heroes has the brain activity of a bunch of lemmings. Not even basic training or common sense.- In the great battle of dragons you can see how just a couple of shots of dragon-breath almost collapse the wizard tower. The sky is filled with dragons just flying around doing nothing. If they participated in combat in any way, the evil wizard would be broiled in a second.The movie is based on an existing world, so why change some of the D&D fundamentals that have no effect on the plot?- Why, oh why? A mutating virus has hit the elven community. Suddenly they are short, stocky, armored in Stormtrooper-design plastic (with the most ugly ever bits hanging in the field of vision) and have _crossbows_.

This movie was so phenomenally bad that I can't even think of an adjective negative enough to describe it. This is the kind of thing that straight to video couldn't have salvaged; that it actually had a theatrical release is staggering. I was expecting this film to be bad, but the true scope of its horribleness is beyond comprehension or anticipation. It is truly and magnificently wretched. Dungeons & Dragons makes _Conan the Destroyer_ seem like Hamlet in comparison.The acting generally falls into two categories mediocre actors who probably did the best they could with the material and normally good actors (Thora Birch, Jeremy Irons) who should be ashamed of themselves. Birch's dialogue is delivered woodenly as if she just wants the shoot to be over. As for Irons ((are those his real teeth?!? well, he is British)), his lines are spat out with such over-the-top absurdity it seemed he was exacting some sort of revenge on the producers. His snarling, rasping, phlegm-soaked performance left me thinking maybe he was blackmailed into doing this project. The only bright spots were the performance of Zoe McLellan as Marina and a very distinguished cameo by former Doctor Who maestro Tom Baker as Halvarth the Elf. Don't even get me started on the Marlon Wayans character -- I believe he single-handedly destroyed several generations' worth of progress defeating racial stereotyping in Hollywood. I hope he got a nasty letter from the NAACP.Hammy dialogue atop a ridiculous storyline made for an unwatchable mess. The classic Dungeons & Dragons theme is the dungeon crawl hack-and-slay and a movie with this brand name to live up to should have capitalized on that. Instead we are treated to some convoluted plot about empresses and mage-councils and an oppressed population we never see.Unlike some of the other reviewers here, I found the sets, props, costuming, and effects to be adequate for a B-movie, and even good at times considering this is really a C- or D-movie. All those thematic elements are lost behind the atrocious script and acting, however.D'ya know how sometimes you want to experience something for yourself so you can decide on your own if it's as awful as people say? Don't do that with this movie. I promise that you'll spend the rest of your life trying to get those two hours back. It's not even worth downloading a pirated copy.

In one part of the movie Snails says something along the lines of That is the riddlyiest thing I have ever heard. Not only was that unfunny, but entirely out of place. The direction was off too, and the scenery was okay, but the camera-work was so flat and unfocused, it was barely a redeeming quality.

Jeremy Irons is a great actor, participating in fantastic films like Lion King and Reversal of Fortune. But as the villain in possibly the worst performance of his career, not helped by the terrible dialogue he was given, he chews the scenery to pieces, honestly the dreadful overacting puts someone like Tim Curry to shame. Marlon Wayans was cringe worthy, his humour was lame and in some cases unnecessary, and Justin Whalin; bland beyond bland. Unbearably wooden at times, and as the hero? Tom Cruise did better in Legend and he was the main flaw of that movie. Just for the record, I do think Legend has its flaws, but it is gorgeous to look at, and Tim Curry's Darkness was phenomenal, and should've got an award. Thora Birch acquits herself better, but her dialogue was poor, and I was thinking, is she a little too young for the part? Overall, terrible.

The secondary characters, like the purple guy and various market people are unbelievable and horribly portrayed -- trying too hard to resemble the bar scene in Star Wars. Marlon Wayans is a complete misfire in casting, as well as the main character guy, whose name escapes me.

The dragon at the beginning is so phony looking, how people could continue on believing in this garbage is beyond me. The maze and portals are ridiculous, and there's about 10 minutes of film where we get sweeping shots of tall buildings as a segue into the next scene. Just all a redundant mess this is. The final battle with all the dragons can be summed up in one word LAME.The screenplay is hogwash. Awful dialogue and terrible action scenes.

This much anticipated movie of 2000, titled as the very popular role-playing game, should do much to further the question of What were they thinking? A great deal of the movie is spend in grandiose costume and CG sets with the actors, primarily one Jeremy Irons, as Profion an evil wizard, over acting in the most laughable manner. Which is odd because Jeremy Irons has never really done anything remotely laughable.Irons had company in the theatre of the absurd acting style and that was with back up villain played by Bruce Payne as, Damodar in blue lipstick and shaved pate, delivering lines like a macho Tim-Frankenfurter-Curry.And that is what is at odds with some of the primary components of this movie. I'm sure they did not want the villains to be completely laughable because they would have wanted them to generate enough fear or dread from the audience so they would be concerned for the welfare of the goods guys.Then you have the good guys, Justin Whalin as Ridley and Marlon Wayans as Snails, who are suppose to have the kind of lighted hearted swashbuckling, devil-may-care, attitude which has been a foregone clich√©' in the forms of Han Solo and Indiana Jones. However in D&D the lead character, Ridley, was more like a generic Starbuck from the TV series Battlestar Galactica. Marlon Wayans as the reluctant Snails had lines that were suppose to be comic relief but were flat and lackluster.I do want to say that I am a huge fan of the Sword and Sorcery genre. I have read many of the great books from Robert Jordan, The Wheel of Time series, Terry Brooks the Shannara series, and as well as the first three Dragon Lance novels by Margaret Weiss and Tracy Hickman. I really enjoyed those books. So don't get me wrong I do love the genre and I know what it takes to make a good Sword and Sorcery story, yet I was expecting more out of this movie.The character of the Empress Savina, played by Thora Birch was so visually reminiscent of Queen Amidala from the Phantom Menace that I could not help but be reminded of Amidala every time Birch was on the screen in those over the top costumes.The story to D&D is real predictable. You know the standard, OH my God the Princess, Empress-whatever- is in trouble and the evil mean guy is going to ruin everything for her and that will be terrible because she is so nice and concerned about her people-and she's a hot looking unit to boot- so we have to get some reluctant swashbucklers to go through a whole bunch of cool exciting stuff and find a magical thing that will make everything better just in the nick of time before evil mean guy can make the Princess or I mean the Empress lose everything and cry her pretty Hollywood mascara saturated eyes out.There is a scene in this movie where the character Ridley has to navigate a maze to obtain an important component in finding the magical thing to help the Princess err I mean the Empress. This was like a cross from Return of the Jedi and all The Indiana Jones flicks combined. I couldn't believe there wasn't one original pitfall in the whole thing.You know I always thought Dragons were supposed to be formidable and intelligent. At least in all the books I read they were. Remember George Lucas's early eighties production of Dragon Slayer? That dragon for its time was awesome and fearsome. The Dragons in this movie were so blatantly computer generated that there wasn't anything remotely sentient or frightening about them. I don't know if they want people to think that in the world of Dungeons and Dragons the Dragons look cool as unapologetically CG creations? The grand finale battle scenes were disturbing in that I kept thinking, What are those X-wing fighters flying around out there? You see there were so many dragons flying around and spraying fire out causing other dragons to go crashing to earth like jets or X-wing fighters in a dogfight. It was very distracting, as it had no look of realism. It just didn't feel like a movie that took place in the time of Dungeons and Dragons.By the way did you see the size of that Dwarf?

On top of that the story feels messy. It introduces some plot lines in the beginning of the movie, that potentially seemed like good and interesting ones but then suddenly decided to abandon these plot lines for such a long time and starts to concentrate on the extremely formulaic and weak 'adventerous' story-line of the young and totally uninteresting characters. Only after more than halve way through the movie it decides to pick up the first introduced plot-line again, featuring the Thora Birch and Jeremy Irons character. It feels like two totally different and disconnected parts, so when the two of them start to mix it just doesn't work out.The acting is just plain bad. You know, the sort of bad acting that becomes irritating after a while. This is especially the case with Zoe McLellan and Thora Birch. But of course also the weak and silly dialog doesn't help much. Perhaps it also has to do with the fact that director Courtney Solomon was still completely inexperienced at the time. And who's bright idea was it to cast Marlon Wayans? He feels totally out of place as the comical relief of the movie. And what a waste of the Jeremy Irons role. He perhaps has never played a more stereotypical generic evil movie villain but the movie he does it in is one of his worst. Bruce Payne also acts as if he thinks he is the new Darth Vader.

Many of the characters show similarities, story elements are the same, some sequences are directly copied and really the list goes on and on but these are the three most obvious elements.

Otherwise, the rest of the movie has a rather boring look. The setting is kind of fantasy-land Middle-Ages, but the story is right out of Star Wars; there is some rather shameless ripping-off from it going on here. (Obviously, Lord of the Rings is another source.) There is a wise old elf (=Yoda) who talks about the force - without the actual word being used. Then there is the young, short, robot-like Queen with the face of an angel (Birch) who is nothing more than Queen Amidala. Then we have the hero waving a magic thingy and in the last moment deciding not to turn evil like Irons - i.e. Luke and Vader in the finale of Jedi. Then we had that major sword fight between the hero and Irons's right-hand man, which starkly resembled any sword-scene from the Star Wars saga. Then there is a canteen scene with a variety of creatures and humanoids, i.e. the Star Wars Tattooine bar scene. Some other movies also get ripped off, but to a much lesser extent, from what I gather. The film has a sort of humourish approach, but later on tries to turn much more somber in tone, so there is a problem there as well.Then there is the cast; a mixed bag. Let's start with the worst having the least talented Wayans is downright awful; it's the skinny, ugly one, and he is uniformly unfunny. (Plenty of consistency there, I must give him that once he decides not to be funny he stays unfunny no matter what.) Fortunately, and rather surprisingly, he gets killed off half-way through the movie, only to be - very, very predictably - resurrected at the very end. (In one movie catalogue the film is accused of being racist because Wayans is just a little side-kick to the white hero. Am I on the wrong planet?!) We shall continue with the second worst Jeremy Irons. From the very first scene of the movie, we are presented with an Irons who clearly has no idea what he's doing; he is grossly over-playing the evil genius, to the point where it's near-embarrassing to watch him. His grimaces aren't menacing; they are silly, overly manic and amateurish. What he did in the movie wasn't acting but a series of gymnastics exercises for the face. Birch is very cute, but appears little just a little, and is slightly awkward with her imitation of the robotic Queen Amidala. The other white brunette is charismatic, making the most of a seen-it-all-before script. The male hero is okay (over-acting at times), and so is the bald villain with the ridiculous lipstick.

Some of the special effects looked like they were borrowed from a Playstation. I would have laughed had they not been so bad. Half of the beginning was needlessly panning around those sad excuses of computer animated buildings. Was there any apparent reason for that besides computer animation is nifty?The acting was terrible from all fronts. I was most disappointed with Jeremy Irons who has done much better in movies such as The Mission (1986). However, as Profion he seemed more like the Phantom of Krankor, the villain from Prince Of Space (1959). The only reason he came off as a bad guy was because he snarled and had shifty eyes. And why is it that neither of the two main villains can talk right? Profion speaks with that annoying lisp and shouts out every other word. That prevents any sort of coherence at all. Bruce Payne (as Profion's bald, lipstick-wearing, transexual sidekick Damodar) talks like a sad Shatner wannabe. He appears to be evil because he speaks haltingly throughout the movie.

It seemed that their vision of the game-related humor was just to mention some of the terms. Here is an example of what they might consider funny dialogue I'm going to cast HOLD PERSON on you!

TEN YEARS and it ended up as this rotting pile of filth. You could get a higher quality story by taking a group of teenage Dungeons & Dragons nerds and watch them beat the snot out of goblins and ogres for 3 hours. In summary, this movie was amazingly disappointing. One out of ten because IMDB doesn't have any numbers between zero and one for voting.

That will undoubtably change with the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, but for now, let us focus on Dungeons & Dragons.As a lifelong fan of the game, I had long known a movie was in the works, but even five years ago when I read the plot outline (the script was being worked on for ten years), I was disappointed.  Main heroes--thieves? Politics?  More and more it sounded like the less-than-imaginative, coorporate mentality of D&D in the 90s rather than the classic mythos of the 70s and 80s that made it great (al la, when Gygax was still with TSR).Well, I would give the movie the benefit of the doubt, and we geeks and lunatics went on opening night in full costume to mark this long awaited event.  Credit where it's due, the movie's relatively small ($33 million) budget did turn out good production values, including a wide variety of beautiful, very D&D-like sets, costumes, and special effects.  However, the movie was crippled beyond hope by the script and acting.  Yes, the plot was imaginative, but you think with TEN YEARS of development one would have realized and fixed all the plot holes, the biggest of which was the fact that, in the end, the heroes accomplished absolutely nothing!  All they did was spend the entire movie tracking down a rod that controls dragons, only to end up giving it to the villain, making him stronger than ever, and then the princess he oh-so feared whips him anyway, probably (and off camera of course) to Thorna BITCH at the heroes afterwards--Thanks for making my job tougher, guys!The acting was atrocious.  I know this game was targeted at teens who play the game, but it felt TOO MUCH like a game.  You would think that moviemakers would have learned from such fiascos as Super Mario Bros and Double Dragon that, in order to turn a game into a film, it needs to take itself seriously.  Jay Jar Wayans could have been left out, the Princess (Thorna Birch) could have tried to be something other than a piece of cardboard, and the other characters could have actually been there to do something.  Back to the fault in the script, isn't the main concept of D&D an adventure PARTY?  But in this movie, it's always a lone hero going forward while the rest of the party hangs in the back.  Well, that along with the empty ending, I guess, accidentily, they DID make a movie that plays like a D&D game of today.  Hmmmm...If you approach this movie as a campy, popcorn movie, then it's a surprisingly good treat, eye-candy mostly.  However, if you have any love or passion for D&D, any desire to be thrust into a fantasy world, or any hope of a gripping adventure, then try to avoid this movie as much as a modern D&D adventurer avoids danger.Given the rich mythology of D&D developed over the last twenty five years, the countless worlds and countless possibilities for storylines, it seems that a script ten years in the making ended up with the most politically correct (gahhhh), Star Wars-like, cheesy, save-the-world scenario possible, which, of course, is totally against the spirit of the D&D game.  Now, for a few nit-pickin's1) No fighter.  Given D&D's Conan roots, you'd think there would be at least one fighter in the party, but there wasn't.2) The dwarf.  He was almost as tall as everybody else.  Although he played a dwarf rather well (given the stereotypes), he just wasn't dwarven.3) Stolen scenes.  Mostly from Star Wars.Oh well.  Actually, an official D&D movie was never a good idea, because the whole of D&D mythology could not be compressed into one movie, or even an entire series of movies.  We're better off enjoying cinematic treats like Conan, Willow, and Lord of the Rings, and re-living their mythologies in the D&D world.  That said, look for the Lord of the Rings to completely change moviegoer's views on fantasy, and finally establish the genre.  Forget George and Jar Jar--LOTR is the Trilogy worth waiting for!I'm still a fan of D&D, even if they've totally lost their way.

It is pure D&D, at least as far as I know it from 25 yrs of game mastering, a truly deep delve in the world of gaming. That so many people despise, nay, hate it with all their heart's content (look at the board) shows, how close it hit home in that regard.Some high points and how they relate to gaming.1) Irons chewing up the scenes. He has a better voice than I do, but apart from that I do the same thing at my game table when representing the villain. Alternatively I do the menacing silent guy.2) Payne slow moving 'n stuff. You must be joking. He actually quotes me. In my games, when the group doesn't realize their foe is way over their head, I let him move slowly and utter lines like that. (Not that it would help much, stupid players) 3) Death of Snails; well, when a character (not the player!) has done enough to seriously p*ss me or the rest of the group off, he is bound to meet his end (always with fair means and a chance to escape). And who p*ssed the audience more off than Snails? I remember the cheers in the theatre. (And yet it was touching in a weird way). Snails also is a persona frequently found at gaming tables - the wisecracking dumb*beep* who is spoiling the fun with his witty and funny remarks. Death to him I say. (Representing a player and a PC? Uh-uh, multilayered reality ;) ) 4) Plot. Cheesy world saving quest with dungeon hopping and a quick dash into the elven woods for some R&R and a lot of Behind-the-scenes wisdom. What gamemaster of our (the first) generation never has used that plot line or at least considered using it? (The plot revealed in the deleted scenes on DVD actually works very well within the limited scope of a game world.) 5) General acting skills. Despite the fact that solid to good actors are doing strange things here - can you remember how your high school buddies roleplayed (i.e. acted) their characters at the gaming table? How did that look like? Ring a bell? I could go on for a quite a while.6) The dwarf too tall, mage not using spell components properly - hey, currently my tallest player is having a halfling character, and complicated spell-casting rules tend to get muddy in the thick of things. That's the way of these worlds, isn't it. You need a dwarf (and an elf) in the group to save the world, don't you know? Well, latest player to join gets one of them, regardless of height....Solomon did not bring us a movie in the D&D universe. He also did us not explain the actual game mechanics. He created a movie immersing us in the D&D experience. That's something different, and he like so totally delivered. D&D (IMHO) is cheesy, campy, over the top and (from a narrative point of view) quite often very bad, all this adding up to several trainloads of fun. Naturally this does not refer to people having adopted D&D 3.X, which tends to take itself too serious and causes the most boring gaming tables (apart from Shadowrun) at cons.All in all I nearly laughed my head off. Irons was completely unchecked by anyone on the set and so much fun! I think he tried to get back at his director, but in the end, he makes this movie an outstanding piece of camp. Will be a cult classic in 10 to 15 yrs.Just my 2 cents. If you hate it, feel free to do so. I guess you have reasons. For all the others - make a double feature of Dungeons & Dragons and The Gamers and a lot of beer, it is surreal. It rocks! You may throw in the Ring Thing just for good measure (more beer and a fondue).Oh, and avoid the sequel to Dungens & Dragons - it is supposed to be taken serious but is just a neutered piece of C-picture.P.S.

I'll give you a clue Squall.On top of that, the acting is terrible. Whenever a certain bad guy (baldy with flaming blue lipstick) would appear on the screen, I would cringe at the oncoming lines that would be poorly executed by him. I have never seen someone so boring in such a cool suit of armor. Then they actually had the nerve to mix in CGI with the guy..ohh...what a mess...Before watching this moronic journey of stupidity, I hadn't seen a movie so ill-conceived. I hope some day this atrocity will be avenged, and possibly a Peter Jackson-esque director will pick up the D&D title and make something good out of it.Overall grade 20% F- (For pity, and marketing effort) "}{"Title":"Unbelievably bad","Date":"19 January 2004","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":"  One of the worst movies of its time.

Wasted potential.","Date":"1 December 2003","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":"  Seeing a film in the theater on Christmas Eve has been a tradition of mine since I was a kid. On Xmas Eve 2000, my theater hadn't yet gotten Cast Away or Crouching Tiger, but it did have my third choice, D&D. Well, I've never been so intricately close to D&D that I would have been labeled a sinner in the 80s, but I have ALWAYS loved medieval fantasy, and many of the D&D stories and characters. So, I had the feeling going to the film that I would have a good old popcorn munching time with one of my favorite genres. No decent movies about medieval times had come out in a while, so what better than D&D to end the drought?Well, I left the theater laughing. Not at the movie, but at myself for having such high hopes. It had potential, I'll say that. I chuckled at a joke or two, I liked some of feel, like magicians and thieves and whatnot. But in the end, it felt like a washed out, Lord of the Rings lite. And who would have known that LOTR would indeed come out a year later and absolutely blow everyone's socks off?The main problem with D&D is its basic plot. Several characters band together to retrieve a magical item and defeat the wizard. Ok, sounds fair. But the characters are so wooden and stereotypical, I just didn't care. The thieves are rebels who believe in justice and equality. The wizards are old and power hungry. The dwarf likes beer and fights. The elves are delicate and mysterious. And that's about the most we get to know anybody, although the main two characters (thieves) get more screen time and somewhat anachronistic dialogue. I admit I was surprised by a death halfway through, and surprised again at what happened / didn't happen with the dead at the end of the film. But outside of that, it's pretty stock stuff. And don't look for Jeremy Irons to save the film, he overacts here with the best of them. Although I did enjoy his last scene or two involving his magic and the dragon battle.I guess bottom line is that it's worth a see if you're a real D&D or fantasy fan, but other than that, it's not that great, and if you've seen Lord of the Rings by then you've already seen better. Just too bland.

You have your bad guys, and you have the heros who have to defeat them.  The heros' quest is helpfully broken up into smaller tasks, introduced with lines like In order to find the magic rod, we must first get the Eye of the Dragon from the head of the Thieves' Guild.  Even the settings look like something you'd find in a standard RPG video game.The problem, of course, is that this isn't a game, it's a movie.  In a video game, you have some hand in the fate of the characters, and you can spend time figuring out just how to get past that one level.  With Dungeons and Dragons, all we can do is watch, and think about how incredibly dumb it is.Welcome to Izmier, ruled over by one of those teenage monarchs who can manage an entire kingdom at an age when most of us were having a hard enough time managing our hormones.  Empress Savina (Thora Birch, in what looks like Natalie Portman's Star Wars castoffs) wants to declare equality among her people.  That she apparently has both the authority to declare this and the power to enforce it is, of course, a sign of totaltarianism, but never mind. It's just an excuse for the evil mage Profion (Jeremey Irons) to attempt a rebellion, for which he needs a MacGuffin of a magic rod which will enable him to control red dragons.By circumstance, the map needed to find this rod is in the hands of who I fear are our heros semi-compitent thieves Ridley (Justin Whalin) and Snails (Marlon Wayans), a novice lady mage, an elf, and a dwarf.  Ridley and the mage take an instant dislike to each other, so we know they're destined to be together.  Snails provides what would be comic relief, except it gets old quickly.  By quickly, I mean right away.  The elf exists primarily to wear one of those steel push-up breastplates all female warriors wear in movies like this.  The dwarf does standard dwarf schtick--axe-swinging, alcohol-swilling, and general grumpiness.That's the plot, which mainly exists to give the characters an excuse to go through all the standard sci-fi/fantasy/adventure sequences.  Among the scenarios dutifully checked off a tavern filled with a colorful, multi-species clientele, a booby-trapped maze, the capture and rescue of the principal female character, dire warnings that the thing which everyone's looking for would best remain undiscovered, and hints that Ridley has some great destiny.  And the final battle sequence, fought by huge computer-generated dragons who breathe fire and crash into the scenery (hope Savina has a good urban renewal budget).  All of these sequences have been lifted wholesale from other sources, most notably the Star Wars and Indiana Jones movies.  And it's not just the plot that's been ripped off one of the musical motifs sounds as much like the Imperial March as possible without paying John Williams royalties.Hey, I've got nothing against ideas that have been done before--heck, this stuff wasn't exactly original when Lucas and Spielberg appropriated it. But Indiana Jones and the first Star Wars movies were done with energy and style, a sense of conviction and fun that made the material work. Dungeons and Dragons slogs from one scene to the next, often without any sense of connection between them, making it feel more like an obligation than anything interesting.  The cast is either lifeless (Whalin and Birch) or ridiculously over-the-top (Waylans and especially Irons, who snarls and bares his teeth more than his Lion King character).  There are a couple cameos designed to provide chuckles for the geeks of the audience, but they're mild thrills in a movie that has no major ones.

Even as a die-hard D&D fan and even though I found myself chuckling ruefully at a few points in watching this, I really enjoyed the film.  YES, a level-two thief is not going to beat a level-10 fighter in combat (guesses here of course), and YES the boy should not have been able to fight like he did at any point in the film; BUT at least the killing of Damodar was with a trademark-thief backstab.

And YES Jeremy Irons acted like a fading Shakespearian, but evil mages are REALLY evil.  You can't gain control of that much power without some of your traditional evil-power-hungry-megalomaniacal madness.  Somebody claimed it was too clean; I think the extended periods in the thieves' guild, dungeons, and tavern did a great job of painting both sides of the D&D world. A couple of things I didn't like, though; the heroes go through a maze, which is more of a DM contrivance than a real common occurrence in the world.  Also, technical limitations I'm sure, but the writers certainly didn't give credence to the rainbow of races in D&D.

Instead of making its own mark and leading the pack in this kind of a fantasy picture, the writers and director relied a little too heavily on other films to steer their own.Jeremy Irons is the baddie who wants all the power and to rule the fantasy kingdom.  Why Irons accepted this role I'll never know.  Bruce Payne aids the baddie and appears to still be in character mode from Highlander Endgame.  Payne is definitely much more fun to watch than Irons, though.  There's just something about his intensity...Some have said that the Empress is reminiscent of the one in Star Wars--The Phantom Mess, but I was reminded a bit more of The Neverending Story minus her riding a dragon in battle.  Whatever.  It's really unimportant.  I have to say that Justin Whalin makes a dashing hero and plays his part rather well.  He's a cutie and it's easy to see why Zoe McLellan stays so close to him on their quest to find some scepter that controls the red dragons...and will save their kingdom or something like that.  That plotpoint ends up taking a back seat anyway, so just enjoy the visuals.  Marlon Wayons does his best as the wimpy sidekick who screams a lot, way too much like Chris Tucker did in The Fifth Element.Beyond the cast, one would have hoped for a little bit more magic to be seen on screen from mage-in-training McLellan.  Instead, she gets to fume and scream a bit herself as well as take on a few henchmen.  Whalin gets to appear heroic by having sword fights and going through a death maze (ala Spacehunter or Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade).  There was one particular point in the middle of the film when Payne is advancing on Wayans and the music changes and I swear that I thought Darth Vader was going to make a cameo.  Still, while eye and ear-candy, it doesn't amount to a whole lot and everything the main characters do becomes somewhat pointless by the end of the film.Speaking of the end of the film, I had to listen to the commentary track on the DVD just to understand what the heck happened.  I rather liked the element of tragedy in the story only to be let during the last few seconds with the promise of a sequel (that's what the commentary said) that probably won't see the light of day.

A vital part of the game is about a party working together, but in this movie - the hero Ridley went solo through most of the dungeons, while his companions waited outside -- what was the purpose of that?  The ending made little sense, except to make way for a sequel. I would've prefered and ending that reverted to our world, showing a group of gameplayers sitting around a table, finishing up the story we had just seen. The scale of the movie seemed a bit cramped and staged. No attempts were made to combine the sweeping CGI vistas with the live actors. I think they should've left the scenes inside the scroll and the Ridley's dream of the baby dragon intact. On the DVD, you can see these scenes and others under the Deleted Scenes section. I think they ran out of time with this movie, and wanted it released in time for Christmas. If they had done more post production, it may have been a much better movie.

But in this movie, most of the inherent magic of this fascinating world was simply let out for poor effects and cheap character stereotypes. The female mage has nothing to do but to look nice and to scream in moments of danger. She hardly ever uses her magic abilities, and therefore is a splendid example of the poor role play adaption this movie is. She is no mage - she is simply a damsel in distress.The humor of the movie also is very simple and nothing to really laugh about. That is, if you leave out Jeremy Irons' incredibly bad acting - his bad mage routine should be added to acting books under the chapter how to overplay a character. But, to be true, those were the most funny moments of the movie, so at least Irons was good for something here...All in all a rather unspectacular start to the new wave of fantasy films which will accompany the giant blockbuster Lord of the Rings production.

Almost as a kind of revenge, film-makers during the nineties have taken extremely popular games and turned them into unwatchable nonsense.  &#145;Dungeons and Dragons' was one of the most long awaited adaptations, and perhaps because of the length of its gestation period, the finished film could never live up to some of the fans expectations.  It's a pity though that it fails to live up to any expectations.Rather than keeping with the ready made plot contained in the classic D&D cartoon series, the film makers have attempted to create a status quo akin to a group of friends playing the game.  Indeed, the dialogue at times mimics the creativity of a bunch of game players during a post-pub dungeon hop.  For the first half hour of the film, it almost becomes expected that the scene would dissolve into a group of people in home made costumes gathered around a table (a feeling which returns at the film's coda).  Instead, sense of disbelief is stretched to its limit as a series of characters without pasts are dragged through the hero's journey, the wind whistling through the pages of  Joseph Campbell &#145;The Hero with a Thousand Faces' as it sits on the table next the writer's keyboard.It's a brave move to assume that the audience understands the rules of fantasy as a genre &#150; but despite first glances, it can be as sophisticated or simple as the writer wishes.  Here, too much understanding is expected of the viewer.  The importance of the staffs is never full explained and neither is how they control the dragons.  The important fact (dramatically) that a mage cannot use magic unless she has something to work with is ignored somewhere as well, so for much of the film we wonder why our friends keep getting captured.  The Arthurian abilities of Ridley also seem far fetched.  Yes, we know he's special, but could you show us how?  These are small things, but as they niggle away at us whilst we watch they draw us out of the story.  Perhaps the most likable parts of the film are in the scenes were the actors are not running around and shouting at each other.  Justin Whalin shows the charisma of a young Dennis Quaid;  Marlon Wayans is more likable here than in &#145;Scary Movie' although he could so with trying to be himself and not Eddie Murphy; Zoe McLellan is startling touching as the love interest and could do well in a none genre piece.  Richard O'Brien must have been laughed himself stupid at getting to play being keeper of maze again in a fight to the death edition of &#145;The Crystal Maze'.  And Tom.  Dear Tom Baker &#150; who despite his elfin ears managed to produce on the few truly human performances.  is said some of the actors don't do quite as well &#150; Thora Birch looks embarrassed to be their in role probably filmed before &#145;American Beauty'; Jeremy Irons decides that if you can't see the set, its best shout a lot and grimace; Kristen Wilson looks disappointed that she didn't get to be Storm in &#145;X-Men', but her role seems to have been curtailed to simple pronouncements.But what of the special effects?  In order to bring a world to life there has to be some consistency in the magic brought to bear in creating that world.  Unfortunately, there is a feeling that a number of different SFX houses were at work, and they all thought they were working on different films.  The magic effects are superb, as good as anything seem in &#145;The Matrix' and its friends.  But its in the imagery of the place, the castles, the landscapes, the dragons, that things become unstuck.  Anyone whose played the old PC classic &#145;Myst' will be familiar with the standard of rendering.  Its almost as though a game was in preparation and the graphics were used here.  In a feature film this isn't enough.  &#145;Dragonheart' proved the sophistication which can be achieved in the imagining of mythic creatures, but the effects here fall short of expectation.  We should believe in the world, not sit and marvel at how sophisticated the rendering is &#150; for that I'll go see Toy Story or Shrek.So overall, a very disappointing experience like many adaptations.  Too simplistic for fans, too irrelevant to the average punter, New Line may have made a mistake releasing the film as a curtain raiser to &#145;Lord of the Rings'.  It's a bit like Lucasfilm offering up &#145;Battlefield Earth'.  If your average cinema goer thinks that this is the best Fantasy has to offer, you can imagine the rest of that series going direct to video. ***  "},{"Title":"This film belongs in a dungeon somewhere.....or a dragon.","Date":"27 February 2001","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":"  The D&D universe is one of epic battles, great heroes and very nasty villains.

Also, the series of traps we see Ridley go through at one point clearly rip off the Indiana Jones series. I can live with this somewhat, but it does detract from the movie nonetheless.The character development is fairly good. Ridley begins the movie as a typical thief. However, we later find that he has an apparently cynical past due to his hatred of the mages. Although he loses points due to how hard it is to not compare him to Luke Skywalker from Star Wars fame. Profion is pretty much how we would all expect an evil wizard to be. Hungry for power, hungry for land, hungry for slaves, and unwilling to stop at anything to get them. Most of the other characters don't get much room to breath, but when they do, we see a lot of personality from them. Except for Elwood. He doesn't get much to do. Although with the long cast, that's expected. We also see something of a psudo-romance between Snails and Norda. Snails is trying to put the moves on Norda. Whether she is returning or spitting on his advances is open to debate.The One bad thing about the movie is that the last 20 or 30 minutes seem rushed. Ridley is transported to Profion's castle via a magic portal used by Damodar, gold dragons are suddenly attacking Profion, and Ridley's friends are joining the battle, even though we would have assumed they were a few states away 8 minutes ago. And after Profion is killed, we find that the empress has given mages and normals equal rights. Huh? That's the sign that they were running out of money/time to make the movie.Despite this crippling flaw, Dungeons and Dragons is well worth watching. I know I enjoy it. Especially on my DVD copy. And for those of you who felt a need to give this movie a 1, let me present you with two fantasy movies Conan the Barbarian and Hercules in New York. If D&D is a 1, what the hell are those two stinkers?

I should add that before seeing this film she did not know what Dungeons & Dragons was, while I used to play it a fair bit (ahem) in my misspent adolescent years.  The film managed the great feat of creating a world which was at the same time completely understandable to someone who was uninitiated and entirely familiar to someone acquainted with the principles of the game.I cannot understand the zero ratings this film has received from some reviewers.  I have fairly mainstream tastes, and in terms of plot, dialogue, lack of characterisation and so on, it is certainly no worse a film than Star Wars The Phantom Menace or one of the Die Hard films - again, not exactly high-brow films but thoroughly enjoyable nevertheless, and certainly the kind of film I like to watch to relax.Indeed, some elements in this film are outstanding the costumes, the gothic imagery, the real-life locations in Prague (dig that library!).Among the actors, we were particularly impressed by Justin Whalin, who made a fine and believable young hero, without any of the brattish qualities that a lot of actors in similar roles have had (think Mark Hamill), also by Kristen Wilson who is simply a delight for the eyes.  We had not heard of her before, (we have not seen Dr Doolittle) ...  but it seemed to us absolutely right to cast a lithe and graceful former ballerina in the role of an elf.  Or should that be a half-elf, perhaps?  It was not clear why Norda and Halvath looked significantly different from the other elves unless they were half-elves. In terms of accurate portrayal of D&D the game, I very much liked the fact that all the characters had a clearly defined class; the rivalry between different character classes; the clear alignment of characters (chaotic good, lawful evil etc); the fact that magic users needed ingredients (e.g. magic dust used by Marina Pretensa) for their spells; all the traps; the 'game balance' that is to say that there were few monsters and that most 'opponents' were humans/humanoids; the fact that Profion had a familiar.   I did not think it was accurate that a thief (Snails) should be clumsy, nor that characters who were supposed to be of low levels of experience (Pretensa, Snails and Ridley) had so many high level abilities - Ridley's excellent fighting skills, Pretensa's powerful spells.  Also I found the presence of what were apparently orcs in the tavern to be a trifle bizarre.Having watched this on DVD, one thing stands out, though, and that is that some inexplicable and, can I say, inept cuts were made in producing the final print.  Several key scenes which are absolutely necessary to understand the plot have been cut - one where Elwood Gutworthy (the dwarf) introduces himself to the rest of the party, one where Ridley and Pretensa are actually inside the scroll and given a map of how to find the Rod, one where the romantic interest between Norda and Snails is developed.  There is no apparent reason for these cuts - certainly the quality of the deleted scenes on the DVD is just as good as the rest (although of course they have not received post-production processes - you can actually see the sudden transition from polished to less-polished in the Norda/Snails scene).  If other reviewers have given the film low ratings because of these cuts, I can perhaps understand it ...And to any director/editor/studio thinking of cutting scenes as a result of test audience feedback, I have a piece of advice for you Don't.  (For a good example of why this is not a good idea, see the 'Making of' feature on Twelve Monkeys.)

I watch it on a semi-regular basis, because it has a certain character, and some rousing music. (It also has mages, an arrogant elf, a cranky dwarf, and a huge dragon war. But I digress.) Many people say it's the worst movie they've ever seen. I say look at Battlefield Earth, which, though a nice idea, managed to do everything in the book that the characters didn't do. I say look at Napoleon Dynamite, which I cannot bring myself to watch even a first time for fear my intelligence will somehow be reduced by the mere act. No, I won't say this is the greatest movie ever, but it is one that can be enjoyable. I'm not the huge D&D fan that some of these people writing reviews are, and maybe that makes a difference. I do know that I can enjoy Final Fantasy Spirits Within, even though it has almost nothing to do with Final Fantasy ANYTHING, except for Cid and a flying ship. Sometimes a movie just needs to be taken on its own merits. For example, I recall seeing D&D at the theater (yes, the theater!) and thinking the dragon war scenes were what I'd wanted to see in Star Wars Ep. 1.

I am a bit lengthy here, but I work to make a point. The first of, on date of writing, 3 Dungeons & Dragons movies is a powerful roleplaying work. It is really not played by supreme actors, still each actor and actress did quite a performance in their roles as characters any D&D player of the planet can recreate within the rules of the pen & paper game.The people called bad actors here should have been called pioneer roleplayers along with it, as even flawed efforts are better than the ever-moaning horde which neither funds a project, nor invests any own work in finishing one!CONTEXT A magocracy has been selfish and rigid for too long, henceforth getting separated and weak. Evil sensing it musters its champions to indulge a proverbial hostile takeover. The involuntary 'heroes & heroines' are forced to make their stands, as the story unfolds with fools lying vanquished along the wayside.Sense Motive The idea of social change is something plenty of teenagers consider powerful, necessary, and somehow their birthright. No miracle then that they waste their own energy on that plus some ever-obvious attempts to get laid and party. Within the movie we get the classic love overcoming prejudices, as the Romeo here is a Rogue from the disease-ridden underclasses & Juliet is a wizard from the establishment. BONUS The duty of the elven ranger, the duty of the evil fighter, and even the thieves guild; Are all recognized as lessons any character above level 8 MUST know. Levels 8 to 12 are the levels which, outside of badly plagiarized video games, focus mostly on building a class-suiting stronghold, and learning to operate it. While the movie certainly did not aim at it (like AD&D Birthright did), it was nice to see some decent yet practical examples of it applied properly!How anyone entitling himself or herself a roleplayer & gamer could fail to notice any of it is... Suspicious! For it looks, as if some failures tried to get a proverbial 'smear job' done.LISTED+ The movie introduces D&D storytelling to people with a minimum of background knowledge.+ The movie attempts to compromise between roleplay & acting, though it clearly fails on it here and there, too.+ All characters are authentic and within the rules, compared to video games within which dumbest ideas are forced unto us by cheat- leveled pseudo-superiors. + The movie looks like a high-school or college project done by fans, and that atmosphere is brought across without messing up the story. Even with age 42 I still remembered some teenage moments, did all others forget? ;-) Rhetorical Question. + If you prefer to look only for the bad sides you might manage to find absolutely every negative aspect mentioned by the other reviewers! + The movie succeeded in inspiring a sequel, not a bad re-narration of the same idea.

It starts bad but it gets even worst. Jeremy Irons is horribly overacting. It gets worst in the climax because he is such a big part of it. Thora Birch seems lost trying act opposite his crazy performance. The clunky dialog doesn't help in the least. The climax also has a lot of CGI. The problem with that is the bad CGI. Dragons should be cool but these look cheesy.The meat of the movie is bad but not horrible. The group's quest is a series of adventures that feels manufactured like the game itself. Justin Whalin is a second rate actor doing his best. Zoe McLellan is pretty good. Marlon Wayans sometimes go overboard trying to joke around. The costumes look like Hollywood leftovers. The quest is not that bad for a B-movie, but the climatic battle is simply too horrible to watch. The blame has to be laid at director Courtney Solomon's feet.

There isn't a single element present that is good. In the fantastical empire of Izmir, ruled by a knock-off of the child-like Empress from the NeverEnding Story (Thora Birch as Empress Savina), there is trouble brewing. The evil mage Profion (Jeremy Irons, acting so insanely he gives Nicholas Cage in Wicker Man a run for his money) and his blue-lipstick-wearing crony, Damodar (Bruce Payne) decide to steal the mystical red rod of power, which will allow them to summon the red dragons and take power by force. The protagonists of the film are Ridley (justin Whalin) and Snail (Marlon Wayans, who is so embarrassing as a sidekick he falls just short of wearing Jordans and rapping) who break into the Magic School (that's what it's really called) and get roped up with a young mage/love interest named Marina (Zoe McLellan). They meet up with a dwarf and an elf, included in the film only to make it more fantasy-like, and go on a quest to defeat the bad guys do. Expect Ridley to explore what passes as dungeons and for our heroes to battle some deadly, badly animated dragons.It's laugh-out-loud hilarious and never gets old because the picture keeps throwing new stuff at you. The acting is terrible, but in a nice variety of ways for instance. Profion is way over-the-top, waving his arms around like a madman, chanting incomprehensible spells that sound like they're being made up on the spot and twisting his face in sneers and grins. The Empress on the other hand, is so wooden you get better performances out of the animated skeleton encountered towards the last third of the film, and that guy has no face! As for the main players, several of them are incredibly bland and feel totally irrelevant to the plot. You could have easily thrown out the elf and the dwarf character because they contribute nothing at all.The story is terrible and feels like a generic fantasy film with a couple of Dungeons and Dragons elements thrown in. We've got a random monster who shows up for a single scene and then disappears, just so we can have D&D players go I get that reference! but otherwise the film is filled with weird-looking humanoids that would be more at home in an episode of Star Trek than in an epic fantasy film. The sets here are so incredibly cheap it is astounding. Some scenes are clearly shot against a bad green screen and you can almost see an aura surrounding characters as they talk in front of these big, elaborate castles. Other shots are clearly inside a large library or inside a cathedral that was not built for the film. It's pretty hilarious to see the camera pan around, showing elaborate paintings that in no way fit, as if the editor mistook them for some of the special effect guys' best work and said The rest of this movie looks awful, but people have got to see this! Mostly, Dungeons and Dragons is set in unconvincing dungeons, markets or forests that were probably borrowed from a TV show that had just finished wrapping up, with a bunch of random bones or skulls thrown in to look more menacing.The most memorable and laughable elements of the film have to be the special effects. I understand that this film had a somewhat limited budget, about $40 million dollars. That's not a ton of money so I don't expect the creatures here to look as good as the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park, but this is a whole new level of bad. Someone working on this film was incredibly proud of the CG castle they built and they show it off constantly, but no matter how much you pan up and down, it still looks terrible. Even worse are the dragons. I realize that the film is called DungeonS and DragonS, but if you can barely create one CG dragon, don't include a battle where hundreds of them are flying unconvincingly, spitting fireballs at each other. One of the first scenes features a dragon being killed and the movie tells you right away it is going to be cheap, unconvincing and laughable because the dragon bleeds CG blood. Do you know how easy it is to shoot blood pooling and dripping over stone steps? You just need some corn syrup and food coloring, or at the very least some red paint! They couldn't even get that right, what hope do any of the other creatures here have? The worst offender in terms of bad costumes (most of the armor looks like spray-painted plastic) them all is the elf Norda (Kristen Wilson, looking like a Vulcan from Star Trek). Ever see one of those paintings, perhaps on the side of a van where a tough-looking barbarian chick has her arms in the air, swinging twin swords? Half the time she's wearing a breast plate that looks like it was painted onto her skin? This elf has exactly that. Literally, she's wearing a breast plate; complete with individual cups and a belly button for extra sexiness. It's impossible to miss because the camera constantly shows her from the neck down. Had we not received many shots of Damodar's epic codpiece, I'd call her boob-plate the most awesome piece of armor in the whole picture.Once in a while, you see a movie that's so bad it earns itself a place in the hall of fame. This is easily the worst fantasy film I've seen. It's a series of colossal mistakes immortalized on DVD and it's glorious.

It doesn't feel like a budget movie, and certainly doesn't show to be a budget movie with the dragons.

They'll do or say something once or twice but they hardly do or say anything else that actually contributes their character to the movie. You start to forget they're actually there as the movie is centred on the main hero, girlfriend, and protagonists.And as for the ending it was something that was slapped in a year later without thinking about how the audience is going to relate it to any part of the movie. It leaves you confused asking yourself what just happened because it didn't happen anywhere else in the movie and there's no reference anywhere to explain why it would happen. It was an effort to make it not seem as depressing but the writer should've at least have thought of adding something somewhere else in the movie to explain why it ended like it did or an explanation at the very end instead of don't question the gift you've been given. In fact it seems that there is a lot of unanswerable questions in the movie with the excuse that it's not to be questioned, and it leaves you a bit frustrated because you want answers to understand the movie, not to be left guessing why some people weren't allowed to help or why things happened the way they did. It becomes nonsensical jibber jabber that screams out badly written because the author couldn't be bothered to put in an explanation and left it to our imagination, but there's only so much our imagination can tell us and without any clues anywhere else you may as well say they can't help rescue the girl because they ate bread for breakfast.

Looking back, I'd say it was about half an hour after the title screen that hope had left the theatre forever as the rest of the patrons openly talked above the dialogue and a particularly mischievous bunch of kids several rows in front had taken to shining lasers at the screen, which was much more entertaining than anything being shown on it. Films such as this are what give the fantasy genre a bad reputation and but this goes one step further, making you question why you go to the pictures at all.The land of Izmer is divided between oppressed commoners and powerful mages who advise the headstrong Empress Savina (Thora Birch). Seeking power for himself, the evil Profion (Jeremy Irons) seeks the mystical Rod Of Savrille which has the power to control mighty red dragons and he soon dispatches his right-hand man Damodar (Bruce Payne) to find it. His only lead is the low-level mage Marina (Zoe McLellan) who has escaped from the magic school with a couple of incompetent thieves - Ridley (Justin Whalin) and Snails (Marlon Wayans). Together with the Dwarven warrior Elwood (Lee Arenberg) and the Elven tracker Norda (Kristen Wilson), our band of heroes begin their quest for the Rod with Damodar never far behind...Rather than wondering too much if you'd heard that synopsis before or whether I had made it up just now, it might be worth pondering how things went so badly wrong. With the exception of Payne and Irons, every cast member is annoying, underdeveloped and saddled with the sort of crummy dialogue you'd expect from an Asylum (the studio that brought us Sharknado) version of the story. Irons is gleefully over the top as Profion, chewing his way through the picture with a sort of manic fervour. He also has the best lines - Let their blood rain from the skies! - but he's just impossible to take seriously, as is Payne. He might well be a sinister presence but why give him lipstick that's such a bright shade of blue, I thought he might have hypothermia? Certainly, those kids with the laser painters weren't taking him seriously either, judging by how often those lips were illuminated. The plot is also ridiculous with impossible leaps in logic, handy coincidences and moronic characters behaving like idiots. This might have been forgivable if the film was loaded with impressive visuals but alas, the ball was dropped here as well. As the camera zooms around the city for unknown reasons, the few mystical creatures that normally inhabit such fantasy lands looked remarkably crude even at the time.I could go on but you get the idea. Dungeons & Dragons is one of the most badly produced, directed and performed movies of any sort and must be marked as one of the fantasy genre's lowest points. Nothing convinces you that you have been whisked away to a faraway land on an epic adventure. The brief cameos from Richard O'Brien and Tom Baker raise a flicker of interest but nothing else. The only thing you can enjoy is Irons working really, really hard to ruin his career - his performance has so much ham in it, I'm surprised PETA didn't boycott the production. Otherwise, you'd be advised to stay well away from this toxic mess of a movie. As for myself, I know now that I should have waited for Peter Jackson to complete his sublime trilogy and have faith in his vision. But comparing Dungeons & Dragons to The Lord Of The Rings is like putting Mike Tyson into a fight with Stephen Hawkings - it's cruel, degrading and barbaric.

I even used the watch the cartoon as a kid in the 1980s. Although I never played the RPG, I used to be - and still am - an avid fan of the adventure gamebooks that you play with a couple of dice. So this is just the sort of film that should appeal.Unfortunately it turns out to be an absolutely appalling travesty of a movie and one of the worst ever made. Gone is any attempt to make a movie on a serious level. Instead, we have a semi-comic fantasy that contains a few recognisable elements from the genre - including a badly-animated CGI dragon - but feels like a student play in all other respects.Everything is bad about this film, and I mean EVERYTHING the writing is horrible, the direction sub-par, the characterisation is nil, the costumes are eye-wateringly ridiculous and the special effects are anything but. Literally the only enjoyment I got from the whole thing were the cameos from Tom Baker and Richard O'Brien, two British cult favourites.Actually, I lie; I did get some fun from trying to figure out who the worst actor was on-screen. It's not Bruce Payne, whose B-movie villain duties come in handy, nor is it Jeremy Irons, who delivers a pantomime performance reminiscent of Alan Rickman's in ROBIN HOOD PRINCE OF THIEVES. It's not Marlon Wayans in another lame comedy relief part, nor is it Justin Whalin, as wooden as he is. No, it's a toss-up between Kristen Wilson, who's really bad as the elf, and Thora Birch as some kind of princess. In the end, Birch wins out; her acting really is that terrible. It's cringeworthy and embarrassing every time a sentence comes out of her mouth.Thankfully, I'd seen the even cheaper DUNGEONS & DRAGONS WRATH OF THE DRAGON GOD, so I had some idea of the level of sheer awfulness I was about to witness. But forget going in to this and having a good time; it's not even so-bad-it's-good, it's just so-bad-it's-bad.

I choose to view the movie in one of two ways, either as a cheesy movie to laugh at with friends, or to view it as the minds eye of a bunch of people around a table playing dungeons and dragons.

I suggest that the majority of the problems must flow from the plot and the dialogue which is all to cheesy and clich√©, the props look plastic the scene setting looks too - for cheap - television, you can almost feel the Styrofoam in it, the dwarf almost seems a sidekick for the sake of it, your not sure why he even bothered turning up, his character seems so inconsequential, the elven tracker tries to act elven serious aloof, but just comes across as wooden, in fact I better stop there as lets be honest none of the acting was compelling. Moments in which your supposed to feel something or have emotion - fall really flat, The plot and the script really must be major culprits in this film. The Elven sword givers, I couldn't even work out what was supposed to be going on there really. Waylans is alive at least, but sadly he just makes you feel he's in frat-house comedy mode, in the wrong time period. The whole thing is just plain awkward, very American takes on medieval alehouses abound etc, clich√©s, but films that don't work have to be made, so that we can get a few good films at the end of the day, people have to practice to get better.

I'll pretty much say it throughout my review. All of this is so bad it's funny. I do kind of feel sorry for the director because he took 10 years of his life to fund... this. There is also 2 things I can guarantee about this movie for you. 1) You will be surprised at the star power this man got and 2) you will be in shock at their performances.So I'll skip the plot because it's about as interesting as watching someone read an entire book silently. I'll talk about the star power... Wow. That's the only word to sum it up - Wow. I mean they got Jeremy Irons, Thora Birch, Marlon Wayans and Richard O'Brien... Also not one gives a good performance. Marlon Wayans looks like he is channeling Chris Tucker with his role (of which if he was intended to be annoying - that would be great!), Tora Birch looked like she wanted to be somewhere else (to be fair, THAT I can understand), Richard O'Brien delivers his lines in a laughable way and Jeremy Irons... I know he can carry a bad movie but here... This is like a Saturday Morning Cartoon villain acting as an over-the-top villain - That's how over-the-top he is.Well Now I'm done with the acting now lets go on the technical side of things... I'm not one to judge effects but I've seen more realistic effects from Doom. You really have to be told this cost $45 million to make. It looks like something Syfy would release. The establishing shots are also bad... Just have a CGI artist draw a building... We don't need to spiral up the outside.Now the story side... Rule-101 We CAN'T get emotionally invested in a character that's channeling Chris Tucker through his performance... We're supposed to care for Marlon Wayans' character once he dies (I'm not kidding you have about 4 scenes where it's supposed to force this down your throat) but instead of crying when he dies, you cheer! Not to mention it's the same with Isthmir. You can't get invested in a world that confuses you all the time and has you scratch your heads.So how does this movie hold up? I'd say it's so bad it's funny. I mean I know a lot of the fans of the game were angry at the movie and I can see why loud and clear despite me never playing the game. It's just one of the movies that you just hate and like at the same time. Much like Plan 9 From Outer Space, Troll 2, The Room and your standard episode of Agents Of SHIELD it's just one of those movies that are horrible yet fun to watch.

I just expected it to try to be a good movie, like most movies.However, I wish I had read the bad reviews first to give me amazingly low expectations, and make for a more pleasurable viewing experience.The actors seem to be having a great time, mugging for the camera and playing overwrought characters. Thora Birch seems high on drugs and struggling to remember her lines, she's having such a great time. At one point, she says that she has define the council instead of defied the council. She then pauses as if she's waiting for the director to yell cut but he doesn't so she continues. The guy with blue lipstick and CGI snakes coming out of his ears seems to think that slowly saying each word makes him seem more serious and sinister. Jeremy Irons seems to be doing his best Christopher Lloyd impression, some mix of Doc Brown and Uncle Fester and Judge Doom.It looks to be filmed at Disneyland... scratch that. That's an insult to Disneyland. It looks to be filmed at Medieval Times restaurant.The actors wear Halloween costumes, rubber masks, pointy and plastic bustiers, plastic jewels, beard wigs, etcetera. Several actors have waaay too much product in their hair, Justin Whalin. The CGI is Toy Story level, or maybe on the level of a Playstation cutscene. Isn't that the dragon from Shrek? The one who fell in love with Donkey? I know that this is supposed to be some sort of alternate universe rather than ancient England, but there are some people that just don't fit in with this environment, namely the Americans.The atmosphere was abysmal. Everything is lit up, well, like a movie studio. No matter what deep forests or dark dungeons, there's always multiple spotlights to highlight the actors. They got their money's worth with that fog machine, too.The writing meanders, lots of stuff happens, tired jokes and tired action sequences abound, people are paired off in supposed romances. Clich√©s like the villain trading a hostage for some item, and the hostage saying, Don't do it! As someone who didn't read the plot, there were still no surprises for me. Had the writing been goofier and winkier, this could have been a parody movie called Fantasy Movie. The actors try their best with lines like, We cannot enter. This task, they must complete alone. So hilarious is this flick that not even the death of a certain main character (and the reactions of the other characters to that death) can avoid a couple chuckles.I really want to compare this to Xena or Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers, but it's sort of like Xena gone wrong. It's a lazier Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. At least those were less than an hour long. This was like 5 hours. Wait, I just checked. This movie is only an hour and a half.

Not only does he yell his lines like he was having an orgasm, but he also pulls some of the strangest facial expressions I've ever seen, some I didn't think could be pulled. The CGI is obvious and uselessly rusty, making Dragons look like pixelated messes from a 1980s NES game and as for the rest, I don't care thinking about it. The story has little to no purpose and Dragon's hardly ever appear, only one at the beginning, and about 5 or 6 at the end, the rest is just a group of kids running away from Jeremy 'Overacting' Irons and his accomplice who looks like he forgot to wash his mouth after brushing his teeth. They do end up in a few dungeons I give you that, but the rest is just running, and fighting. When I say fighting, I don't mean fighting like epic sword battles from Star Wars Revenge of the Sith or Lord of the Rings, I mean just repetitive swings of the sword at each other, just continuous up/down swings that just get boring.

This is an awful B-movie that somehow got a 35 million approved big budget instead of a 2 or a 5 million budget, which is what it looks like. That may not sound like a lot but they weren't spending 100-200 million on films back when this was made. I knew people who worked on it and heard it was a train wreck and that Courtney Solomon had no idea how to make a movie, especially when it came to effects, and was pissing money into the wind, which is why you don't see any of the money in the film. In fact all you can gather from watching this film is that Courtney embezzled the money he was given or he is the biggest idiot on the planet who tried to act like a big shot and like he did know what he was doing and squandered it all on his mistakes. The only reason he got to make a movie is because he owned the rights to the name Dungeons & Dragons and someone was stupid enough to give someone with no experience a decent budget. It says the movie cost 45 million but I remember reading it in the papers and he was given 35. Either 45 is incorrect or they had to spend an extra 10 million to finish the film. Everything about this film was awful. It wasn't even like a story. It was liking watching a D&D game being played in real life, which maybe D&D gamers would enjoy that...maybe, but no one else would. Justin Whalin is the worst casting for this role and this movie pretty much killed his career. He was pretty big and well known in the '90s and you never heard a peep out of him after this awful film. He is too small and just does not look like a heroic action guy at all. The effects in this film are terrible. They look like really bad video game effects. And you can tell they are short on money because they use this same shot twice where the camera sweeps and circles around a computer generated tower. It was probably the most expensive shot in the film so they felt compelled to use it twice. They have a scene where you know they ran out of money because the actors talk about the creature that is in the distance, that looks like a speck on screen. The actors are describing it, rather than showing it, because it's clear Courtney had blown all his money at this point. Only a total idiot makes an animation company show completed animation BEFORE he gives approval. That's what pre-viz and the design team is for.

The films not really epic at all, to be based off a game about monsters, there's very few. 2 species of dragons, a harpy of some kind (resembling the one from Sinbad) and a sort of terd looking thing with eyeballs. Out of all the tings to pick in the D&D universe. There is one thing decent about his film though, and its Marlon Wayans acting. Even in the most terrible of movies, he seems to add some humor to the film. Besides his part the acting and wrighting is crap. Even the so called Epic battle scene between the two dragons at the end isn't satisfying, you see very little of what is going on and the fighting scenes even disappoint too. I was hoping the thieves maze would offer some decent entertainment but again the film fails.

You do not believe the importance of it because the story isn't convincing and the characters do not attract you to them. An awful way to begin a movie, see LOTR's beginning brings you into the world excellently. The character's themselves are childish and the jokes are childish. The story is childish.

He's so awful he makes Xena's Joxer seem heroic in comparison. What makes anyone think that a sappy sidekick adds anything to a story? This seems to be a requirement for some scifi/fantasy scripts. This syndrome is almost ubiquitous on TV; sadly, it still occurs in big-budget movies like this one where you'd think they'd know better. More than a few otherwise potentially good stories have been ruined by the presence of embarrassingly bad slapstick characters like Jarjar Binks from Starwars, Russell (Randy Quaid) from Independence Day or Short Round from Temple of Doom.This could have been a good- or at least watchable- movie if more attention had been paid to the characters, script and editing. A lot of money and effort clearly went into the effects and sets. Zoe Mclellan is appealing as the apprentice mage Marina, and Justin Whalen makes a passable young hero. Sadly, Thora Birch has only a few minutes of screen time, though we see way too much of Jeremy Irons, chewing his way through the scenery whenever he's in front of the camera.

It should be wonderful, a flight of fancy that opens up infinite possibilities, but every time I've played it I've been bogged down by statistics and rules, rules, rules.  Dungeon masters - who should be master storytellers - usually exhibit the imagination of bricks, and run to their guide books every two seconds to check for a figure that comes from Table H in Appendix Y of the Compendium from Hell.Just thought I'd vent about that.So, isn't it fitting that this movie adaptation is also about as imaginative as the average brick?  It serves up cliches aplenty, including the Likable Thief Heroes (like in Conan), the Big Bad Wizard (why is the smart guy always the villain?), the Greedy Rapacious Dwarf (I hate friggin' dwarves) and the elegant, sagely Elves (why didn't the estate of Tolkien sue?).Best part?  The old hams!  Richard O'Brien is great as the Chief Thief, and Tom The Bomb Baker puts in a surprisingly dignified performance as the elven healer Halvarth.  Truth be told, I only saw this movie for Tom, since he's the best Doctor from Doctor Who (a show that proves you can do good fantasy on a low budget), but alas he's only on screen for a few moments.  Still, he out-acts the young cast without having to break a sweat.Amusingly, Tom is fond of complaining that Jeremy Irons is the Most Boring Actor in the Universe, so it's strange to actually see them in a movie together.  Irons, who perhaps took Tom's criticisms to heart, here tries to cast off his stoic reputation but chewing up the scenery so rabidly that you expect torrents of foam to spring from his mouth.  It is, quite simply, the worst performance that I've ever seen a classical actor give in a genre film; talk about miscasting!  Maybe Tom is right about him after all...

But I'm getting off the subject...Unlike the cartoon of the same name (which ran for three years on CBS in the mid-80s, and is also fondly remembered by a surprising number of Brits), this movie came about fifteen years too late to really capitalize on the RPG - anyone who wants to do a movie based on the Magic The Gathering cards had better hustle - and its behind-the-wave status is the first of many hurdles this movie fails to overcome. There's the familiar premise of an evil tyrant wanting to overthrow the nice ruler of a fantasy kingdom and needing a powerful talisman to do so - in this case a device that can control dragons - and the rag-tag band of heroes thrown together by circumstance who have to stop him, and Topper Lilien and Carroll Cartwright's script is short on originality, sense and logic (even by its own terms - the portals that carry people from one part of the land to another seem to stay open for however long the plot demands).Actually, there are so many things wrong with Dungeons & Dragons it's hard to know where to start; the movie never succeeds in transporting you away to another world the way a real fantasy should, the characters aren't even developed enough to be called ciphers, Courtney Solomon's direction manages to muff every single setpiece, there's no excitement or any real emotion to be felt, and the acting... oh dear, the acting! As the princess, Thora Birch is flatter than Sandra Bullock's chest - HEY-O! - and as the villain, Jeremy Irons hams it up so much that even fans of Christmas panto would be embarrassed; Bruce Payne, on the other hand, is stiffness personified as his aide-de-camp. Zoe McLellan is pretty but unnecessary, and as for Justin Whalin and Marlon Wayans... okay, the presence of Marlon Wayans should tell you everything you need to know. Even Richard O'Brien, who otherwise provides one of the few bright spots in the movie as another thief who gets Whalin to go into a maze to get a jewel necessary to the plot (a plot point that lets him come off like he's back on The Crystal Maze), falls into the Really Bad Acting trap before he goes.Oh yeah, and have I mentioned the mostly dreadful visual effects from Digital Firepower, Flat Earth Productions, Station X Studios et al (especially the kingdom's capital city, with buildings that bring back horrible memories of Babylon 5's entirely unconvincing transfer from live-action to CGI)?

I felt that they propagated the stereotypical and negative geek-in-their-parents-basement image that seems to be assigned to anyone with an interest with comic books, even if they never touched a D&D card in their life. That said, I'm well aware that not every D&D player falls into the stereotype the collective has earned. So what possible  reason would I have to check the Dungeons and Dragons movie?One reason Zoe McLellan.  She's been a guest star on two of my favorite television shows-Star Trek Voyager and The Invisible Man-and I wanted to see what other work she had done.  After watching the movie I think I can safely say, bias or not, that Zoe gives the best performance of anyone in the film. Why was the movie hardly wonderful? The answer may lie in the fact that it was director Courtney Solomon's first film.  The documentary on the making of the film featured on the DVD was very informative.  Solomon basically says that he skiped film school and just went out and tried to make a movie.  As someone who has an interest in film I respect and admire anyone who goes out and makes it happen for themselves, but it's not worth much if you shoot yourself in the foot on your first outing.  Perhaps film school would not have been such a waste of time after all...The film opens with a brief voice over which explains where we are and what's going on.  Director Soloman calls this the Star Wars approach and feels that it was the best way to go.  Let me tell you, the man wasn't kidding about taking a Star Wars approach.  When I first saw Ridley, Justin Whalin's character, I thought Han Solo.  His get up looked suspiciously like that of a certain rebel smuggler.  Ok, I though, maybe just a coincidence. After all, Marlon Wayans doesn't really fit the Chewbacca profile.  But my suspicions quickly returned when Ridley began to interact with Zoe McLellan's Marina.  Bickering reminiscent of that between Han and Leia.  Or an attempt at it, at least.Continuing with the Harrison Ford theme, Ridley finds himself at one point navigating a maze which is not much more than a combination of some famous obstacles once faced by a certain Indiana Jones.  Specifically, the maze involves these scenarios The first section has swinging axes that fall from the ceiling when you break a beam of light; Indy met a similar trap in the cave at the beginning of Raiders.  Secondly is a room with tiles. Step on the wrong ones, and the walls emit huge plumes of fire. Indy nearly bit the dust in The Last Crusade when he forgot how to spell Jehovah and stepped on the wrong tile.  After this, Ridley faces a room where spikes come down from above, threatening to impale him. Sound familiar? Yep, Indy and his pal Short Round were saved from a pointy death by Willie in Temple of Doom. When he successfully navigates these perils, Ridley enters the room that contains his prize sitting on a pedestal, just like the gold head statue at the beginning of Raiders.  Oh, but there's more.  At one point in the maze a spike nearly impales Ridley. His reaction?  A slant of the head and a lop-sided grin pure Harrison Ford. Ridley later retrieves another artifact that is protected by an ages old being not unlike the saint guarding the Holy Grain in The Last Crusade.  If you're wondering how this happened, Solomon gives us the answer. The maze was designed by George Gibbs, who was the mechanical effects supervisor on Temple of Doom and The Last Crusade.  It would appear that Mr. Gibbs was feeling nostalgic.The performances by the heros are not great by any means, but they do have their moments. I thought Marlon Wayans spent a lot of time sounding like Chris Tucker's character from The Fifth Element, all that high pitched screaming and squawking.  The villains however were downright pathetic.  Jeremy Irons portrays the worst evil wizard.  He's like something out of an episode of the Power Rangers.  Bruce Payne gets a demotion from main villain in Highlander Endgame to the  second in command lackey in Dungeons and Dragons.  He was ok in Highlander, but his performance here is terrible. And he wears blue lipstick. Why?  Who knows. Maybe he likes it.Dungeons and Dragons never had a chance from the word go.  A virgin director, too much so-so CGI (I'm of the opinion that if you can't afford it, don't try to use it at all), and a weak script that attempted to combine Star Wars and Indiana Jones with Dungeons and Dragons mixed in. After all, that's what the movie was supposed to be about.  Whether I like fantasy or not, and my personal opinion about D&D gamers aside, this movie had much more potential, but it falls flat on its face, largely I suspect, because of the director.

Mr. Saving the world himself is unstable, there are times that he reminds me of what I thought the hero in D&D would look and act like, but in some scenes he seems more like a boy scout than a hero.The visual part of the movie is ok. There are some good animating (and some less good) and moody  settings. A few times I actually felt that the scenes matched quite a lot with my impression of the  game. The people in charge of the costumes also need a pat on the shoulder, especially Irons good guy  costume was nice.

It is utterly horrible and a waste of anyone's money.The reason, though, that I gave this movie a 4 is because, for some reason, whenever it is on T.V, it is one of the best movies ever. If it weren't so bad it could be considered a cult classic.First off, the acting is horrible. Jeremy Irons, a terrific actor, is at his worst. He probably didn't give it his all as he could've thought that it would be a campy hoot to be in this flick. Thora Birch (yes, FRESH off of American Beauty) makes it seem like this is her first movie. Bruce Payne is constantly over-acting and never tones it down; it really might've helped the movie. Justin Whalin delivers the worst NOOOO! ever and really can't show emotions very well. Just think of him as the poor-man's Keanu Reeves. The non-human characters must think there cooler than us, and therefore think that they don't have to act, at all. Zoe McLellan is... OK, she actually fits the part. The only good acting in this movie is by Richard O'Brien (where if you streched his performance as long as others, it would probably be bad). He's only on screen for 5 minutes, but he can do no wrong. The real problem with the acting  is Marlon Wayans. If you've ever played D&D you would know that no Rogue (the class closest to thief) would be that bumbling and stupid, as any Rogue that was would die really fast. If you haven't played D&D, you would know that know human as stupid as him would survive for very long. He really drags the movie down as much as he can as some pretty bad comedic sidekick.The Script is horrible and includes so many bad things. The dialouge is some of the worst you've ever heard. The plot is explained off screen and the characters suddenly know what to do. The plot is pretty bad considering a lot of the story ideas one could find on-line.The sets are pretty lame and look like a high school stage crew put them together. The SFX are descent, for a home computer.Joel Silver really should've picked someone with experience to direct, rather that a first timer. There are several directors that have some background in fantasy, or even horror, that could've given us something descent from the script.With all of its faults, whenever it's on T.V, you know you're going to watch it, if only to wonder why it ever drained 6 bucks from your wallet.

No one appears to have mentioned it yet in these reviews, so I'll throw it out here....The Dungeons and Dragons cartoon series.Yes, this is what we feared we'd be in for with this movie, and guess what? We were very disappointed. This is much, much worse than the cartoon could ever hope to be.To a roleplayer this movie is just about as retarded as it can get. No plot, no consistency, nothing. Considering the D&D game has generated something in the region of 90,000 pages of material you'd think it would just be a case of picking a suitable scenario from the hundreds available and reworking it into a script.But, with a writing team who've done nothing of any note and a director who apparently named his production company after Elvis Presley's mother's dog I suppose we should be grateful it wasn't much worse (although how it could possibly be any worse, escapes me).The acting is dire to the point of being painful. Even the Kings of overacting, Richard O'Brien, Tom Baker and Bruce Payne look sad in this, though it was good to see Tom is still with us. As for Bruce Payne, he always, always, always plays the bad guy, and usually to good effect. But here, with his colourful lipstick, I couldn't help but laugh every time he was on screen, which kind of destroyed his supposed menace. I kept hoping one of the other actors would say Dude, what's wrong with your lips?Only Jeremy Irons seemed to be having fun. His terrible overacting was on a par with (but not nearly so good as) Alan Rickman's in Robin Hood.I note from the credits also that Dave Arneson, one of the founders of the game this trash is supposed to be based on, had a cameo role in the film which was deleted. I don't know whether to cheer or cry. On the one hand it would have been nice to see him, even for just a fleeting glimpse of the man that helped create D&D. On the other, he's probably better off out of it! And why was it deleted? His acting couldn't stink any worse than the rest of the cast.The non-human characters in the story are shamefully dealt with here, with the elves looking ridiculous and dwarfs being relegated to novelty value only. And what the hell was that three-eyed blue-headed mostrosity meant to be? Looked like it'd be more at home on Star Trek. And if I hear another pseudo-Scottish accent coming out of a dwarf....And then there's the big finale with lots of CGI dragons. Well, they look good....in the distance. But up close the big red dragon was about as convincing as the snake in Anaconda. I mean, it looked like it was lifted out of a bad video game.Sadly, another opportunity to promote D&D has slipped by. And people who have never played the game will watch this and snigger when they think of those that do, assuming that this movie defines what it's all aboutThe only bright spot comes with the demise of the Wayans character, Snails. It really is a merciful release to no longer be subjected to his awful stereotypical blackman routine. On the other hand, any real spark of energy the movie has goes down with him at the same time.What an insult this film is to all roleplayers. And if you're not a roleplayer, it's still an insult.

To bring a game spanning such a wide spectrum as Dungeons & Dragons to the big screen was no doubt like slaying a dragon, but this time the dragon won.The plot centers around a sinister wizard (Irons) who seeks to control the dragons, an empress (Birch) who represents the forces of good (although her facial expression remains entirely neutral throughout) and a thief (Whalen) who gets caught in the middle. Irons and Birch are absolute polar opposites in acting styles in this film. Irons is over-the-top with mindless shouting and overacting, while Birch is nearly catatonic in every scene. It's a shame that these two fine actors couldn't breathe enough life into this shameful flick. On a side note, Irons sports a neatly trimmed 20th century hairstyle which appears ridiculously out of place on a medievil sorcerer.This film, intended to be the first of a series, had the simple job of developing the characters in preparation for this would-be mega-franchise. Unfortunately, it didn't work, as I simply didn't care about any of them. They did make a fair attempt to play upon actual recognizable elements of the game, hoping to keep the interest of the D&D players as least, but even the somewhat impressive eye candy was less than captivating.Any number of films of this genre that followed the inception and ensuing popularity of the role-playing game could bear the name Dungeons & Dragons with considerable merit, including Dragonslayer and Ladyhawke. And, of course, since the game derived much of its content from the works of Tolkien, the Dungeons & Dragons movie pales in comparison to The Fellowship of the Ring.

Here are a few of the major problems I had with this film1. Acting  Jeremy Irons, Thora Birch, Bruce Payne.. One would expect at least average acting correct? Wrong, overacting.. underacting.. whatever you want to call it, everyone contributed to the bad acting of this film.2. Props/Costume Design  I'm beginning to wonder if they just drove down to their local Wally World and went to the toys section to pick up all the props/armor/costumes for this movie.. I have never seen worse props in a movie before in my life, and I've seen Feeders.. Staffs, Swords, Armor, all cheesy plastic.. look at the elf's breastplate and tell me thats not the worst of them all, (along side the dragon' staff)3. Star Wars?  I would love for someone to go through the movie beginning to end and count the Star Wars ripoffs.. Dialogue especially, but right along side some of the sets and scenes, they even threw in an Indiana Jones knock off..The only saving grace is fairly good special effects at times, most spells were done well, wide views of the locations (castles, towers), etc.. Although I feel the dragons could have been better, the effects were still somewhat impressive overall..I take one thing with me after viewing the movie, and that is the hope that the ending didn't indicate they were leaving it open for a sequel!My Rating  2 of 10 "},{"Title":"Boredom & Buffoonery","Date":"18 February 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":"  I tried.

Well, okay, Justin Whalin makes a reasonably pleasant hero, who aims to get somewhere close to Brendan Fraser, and doesn't do too badly, given the appalling vehicle he'd chosen to ride on. Bruce Payne as the bad guy with the prehensile earwax problem also deserves a mention for an honourable effort. But that's about it.Oops, no it isn't. Jeremy Irons. What the heck is he doing in this movie? Is he short of cash? What's more, his performance pushes the envelope of ham so far that he's clear into the next postal district.

Marlon Wayans as Snails the thief is equally out of place, the supposed humor he provides falling flat.  Zoe McLellan is intermittently watchable, but her wide-eyed intensity becomes tiresome.  Perhaps we can blame the editor and director for her performance, since they are already to blame for so many of the problems with this film.  Much of what happens in the plot is referred to in dialogue or transpires off camera.  This sort of thing points to script problems and production troubles and is symptomatic of heavy-handed editing for running-time considerations.  Perhaps scenes were shot and did not work out.

As a result what is left looks like a rather pointless adventure of one man who is accompanied by a group of rather pathetic hangers on that do nothing throughout. One character, a dwarven warrior has almost all his scenes cut leaving you wondering why they bothered with him in the first place.Some nice scenes of dragons and a passing beholder (who does nothing but float past) doesn't make up for the rest of the film. The acting is pretty terrible even from Jeremy Irons, who you would generally expect a lot better from. Instead he seemed quite uncomfortable in his role, and constantly over acted. The only people that seemed at all comfortable in their roles were Justin Whalin (Most would know from the Superman TV series) and Richard O'Brien (playing himself pretty much). A better choice for the evil mage would have been David Warner (who did the voice of Irenicus in Baldurs Gate 2, and has always been a superb bad guy in this genre of film). Also choosing an experienced fantasy film director rather then a novice would have helped. They could still have people on hand to make sure the film stayed accurate to the D&D world.I hope that in the future another better film will be produced set in the D&D universe as there is so much potential in there. Perhaps after the Lord of the rings film has been released interest will be ripe again for this genre. We can only hope. You never know, someone may even make a Baldurs Gate film!The extra material on the DVD explains a lot of what you miss (and is quite laughable for the cardboard cut out wraith, and the inflatable baby dragon...but you need to see it really to understand).In summary, if you love d&d don't bother with this film, instead buy the new 3rd edition rules and get playing instead!

Let me also state that I have no real problem with generic popcorn munching movies.  Spoilers may be revealed in the course of my review.Dungeons & Dragons is a popcorn-munching movie.  Or at least it is masquerading as one.  What this movie gets wrong that it's peers do not is that it does not really succeed at any level.  The story is unfulfilling, the acting laughable, and the world created was not terribly immersive.  No small nuggets of anything worthwhile save this movie.I will address the whole special-effects issue quickly.  For the film's modest budget, the production values are decent and I never found myself balking too much at any of the actual technical aspects of the effects. None are overly superfluous, and mostly serve the story.Unfortunately, the story is very weak and and the effects don't have much to go on.  Take the Dragons themselves for example.  It seems that the only purpose the script provides them is to pop up when demanded by mages and and fight each other.  All of the main characters in the movie are painted in broad strokes and stereotypes, which is partly expected for this genre. What usually saves stereotyped characters are quality performances.  Sadly, this movie does not provide those either.  It's as if Courtney Solomon (director) sent all the principals to an over-acting class so they could inject the appropriate amount of cheese into their performances.  The usually superb Jeremy Irons gets maniacal in every scene, not so much chewing scenery as gulping it down in obscene chunks.  Damodar, played by Bruce Payne, is almost as bad, delivering painful dialogue like just like you thieves, always taking things that don't belong to you, all the while appearing constipated.  The main heroes are a forgettable bunch of louts who look and act as if they are in a bad high school play.  Thora Birch is entirely too weak as the Empress, talking about how the kingdom of Izmer should be run as if it were a Wal-Mart.  Justin Whalin and Zoe McLellan portray the films main heroes, along with a Jar-Jar wannabe Marlon Wayans. None of them inspire much reason for us to care about them, and the motivations behind many of their actions are not clear.  One of the most ludicrous situations involves Ridley (Whalin) and Marina (McLellan) falling in love.  They spend a few extreme moments together and are suddenly in love?  What?  Why?  Oh, because he's the cute guy and she's the cute girl and the script says so.  But hey, we do have a scene with the main character falling to his knees and shouting NOOOOOOOOO! as his friend is killed. Some of the acting is decent but from characters on screen for so short a time we can hardly calculate it.  Other story and thematic inconsistencies bugged me.  Why, for example, destroy the wand that controls the Red Dragons effectively setting them free, but keep control of the Gold Dragons?  It is virtually pointless to ask these quetions, however, because the filmmakers don't seem to have cared about any of it.  Another quibble is that several scenes seem to be lifted straight out of Raiders of the Lost Ark or Star Wars.  Some call this homage, and in a good film I'd be inclined to agree. But this movie only cheapens that which it attempts to pay tribute to.  The biggest insult of the plot comes at the end with a cheesy feel-good wrap-up that betrays and cheapens any dignity the movie may have instilled.I don't deny that the creators of this movie had the best of intentions, but when translating something as fantastical as D&D to film, certain reservations need to be taken.  X-Men showed us it was possible to have a fantasy world grounded in reality.  Please, if you're going to pay homage to a time-honored institution, do more than try to make everything look cool.A few saving graces are the passable score (though a bit of a Jerry Goldsmith ripoff) and great locations mostly in and around Prague.  The props and costumes are mostly well-done, and the film has somewhat of a(albeit inconsistent)  D&D feel to it.  This however, is not enough to overcome the movie's glaring shortcomings.Dungeons & Dragons is a paltry excuse for a movie in and of itself, not to mention an extremely bad interpretation of the classic game.  One star.p.s. how can any movie take itself seriously that includes this cliched sequenceHero, pleading with villain who has his friends captured and you'll release them?Villain you have my word,Hero, after seeing that Villain has not released friends you said you'd let them go!Villain, smirking I lied  "},{"Title":"Surprisingly hollow, a waste of time.","Date":"10 May 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":"  Extremely disappointing to see how superficial this movie is, as the mythical aspects of dungeons & dragons could have made for a pretty decent picture. The story feels like a way to tie the various set-pieces together.

The various characters in this movie are virtually interchangable (except for Marlon Wayans' character, whose cheap jokes really start to irritate after a while) , and this is not intentional i assure you. We never learn about motivations, backgrounds or any other detail which could be used to make us care. Which leaves the ending. Suffice it to say it is completely inexplicable, i suppose we are expected to use our own imagination to figure out just what the hell is going on here.

Over the course of the next several years, gamers read occasional breathless releases about how the film was going to be made any year now, but the only thing that came of it was that wretched cartoon. Meanwhile, the guys left running TSR managed to nearly bankrupt the company and Gygax managed to wreck his marriage.

There is a great storyline that could have been used the the fullest, yet I was really disappointed with the film itself.I personally would like to blame it on the editing, at the beginning in particular I found myself unable to blink without missing a scene. They were extremely short and some were even useless... The director sets the entire plot of the movie on about 10 minutes, the rest is just there to fill in the other 97 minutes.For example, there's a scene where Marina and Ridley get trapped into a map... I left the movie theatre wodering what the hell happened when they were in there? But that's left for Courtney Solomon to know and for the audience to wonder...

What went wrong, you two?I had no great expectations for Marlon Wayans, but it was his character the one I enjoyed the most (though it was the silliest sidekick Topper Lilien could have come up with) he gave a not very good but desperatley needed comic relief.As for Jeremy Irons... I don't really want to go there. I'm very fond of his previous work and I really think that he couldn't have played a worse Profion even if he had tried.Then there's Thora Birch... who I would like to nominate as this years Jar Jar Blinks... it's difficult to think this is the same person from American BeautyThe character development is another big mess!

Your guess is as good as mine, but he hams up most every scene he has with hilarious efficiency.  John Steiner (of Sinbad fame) should be proud for the homage, though I think Irons was in on the joke.  Thora Birch (the teen-angst chick from American Beauty) doesn't fare near as well, with her amazing cross-pollination of William Shatner with Queen Amidalia.  She manages to get the worst aspects of both, while still giving a completely straight delivery-I'd venture to say she's worse than Irons.

As such when I saw the trailer for the film with big flashy spells, dragons flying about and sword-fights I was rather looking forward to the idea. Unfortunately the film did NOT live up to expectations and to be fair how could it. The Lord of the Rings trilogy that everyone is (quite rightly) going crazy over is based on one trilogy of books and filmed as a trilogy. D&D is a complete universe with well over 100 novels in different lands and stacks of information. To try and cram all this into one movie was never going to work with the tolls they had at hand. The film was weak, with a truly awful and predictable plot. The special effects were good but not enough to submerse you in the environment (no bad guy should EVER have blue lipstick). The acting was all over the place, some played their parts well while others, notably the non humans were there only so that fans could go through the checklist of Dwarf, Elf, Wizard.The only character who came out with any sort of development was the heroes' sidekick.******SPOILER******The fact that they actually killed the character, while he was making a stand actually showed some development. Everyone could have guessed that the old mage at the beginning would die but to kill off the sidekick and comic relief in one go was quite brave and deserves mention. It also gave the hero a chance to turn a little darker at the end and this could have been picked up on more.****SPOILER END******Overall I would say that the filmmakers should have been braver. They had a great licence so why not set it up as a trilogy, start the quest, put good guys in impossibly bad situation then let them win out in the end. Alternatively why not use some of the existing novels for ideas as I'm sure many more fans would have been tempted by films of Forgotten Realms or Dragon Lance characters. Instead they were clearly testing the water for Lord of the Rings and missed out on a good opportunity, shame.

Although I think the genre of sword and sorcery movies has been greatly overlooked by the major studios, I couldn't imagine why someone would want to openly associate a film with a game known for nerds rolling dice in a basement.  On the other hand, that nerd claque goes to the movies a lot, and D&D was attracting a lot more internet hype and anticipation than the average film.  Then the movie opened and was cacophonously shelled by the critics.  The critics sank gleeful fang into virtually every aspect of the film in an orgy of film slaughter usually only reserved for the most meretricious pieces of garbage like Highlander 2. As a former card carrying member of the D&D crowd when in my teens, and still nostalgic for the game in my 30's, I decided it was worth wasting an afternoon to see if it was as bad as reviewed.It was not.  D&D is a bad movie, but there have been much more mediocre films in the past year that were much more difficult to sit through (Hollow Man comes to mind).  At no point does it ever reach Esterhaszian excess. It's simply a dumb, brightly colored and sometimes fun adventure movie with several disastrous moments and some laughable performances that marred what could have been decent lightweight entertainment.The plot, in a nutshell - the Empress of Izmer wants to share power with the commoners, but an evil sorcerer named Profion doesn't.  This leads to a race for the rod of Savrile, which controls Red Dragons.  For the good guys are a pair of thieves (Wayans and the guy who plays Ridley), a young mage (Zoe McLelland) and a dwarf who has no role or business being there (Lee Arenburg).  For the bad guys, Bruce Payne as Damodar.Mistake number one - Jeremy Irons as Profion. Among a set of undistinguished performances by the leads, far and away the worst is Jeremy Irons.  The spittle flies every time he makes a pronouncement.  Many of these pronouncements are in front of a council of mages, whom he is trying to rile into overthrowing the Empress.  The only time I have ever seen a performance of this ilk work was Kenneth Starr in front of the Republican congress.Mistake two - Bruce Payne's lipstick.  Payne's Damodar is wearing a light blue shade of lipstick throughout the film which only serves to make him look ridiculous.  Since he's the heavy, this detracts from vitually all of the conflict.Mistake three - Marlon Wayans as Snails (yes, the character is named Snails), and his death scene.  Wayans plays Snails as if Chris Tucker wouldn't sign on because the character was too over the top.  Snails is later killed in probably the most disastrous moment of the movie, a scene that is telegraphed long before it happens and is of absolutely the wrong tone.  Imagine a scene in a Brady Bunch episode where Peter Brady is tortured to death in front of the rest of the family who wail and cry as Peter dies and you get the idea.None of the rest of the cast really distinguish themselves, but at least they are distinct characters.  The dwarf character had nothing to do and hardly any lines, and could have been jettisoned.  There are a few nice scenes, particularly a scene where the Ridley character navigates a series of traps in what is laughingly called a labyrinth (there is only one way through and no turns, so how's that a labyrinth again?)  Several of the sets are quite nice, and the movie never dawdles much, so it's quite breezy.The dialogue is somewhere between pedantic and sophomoric.  Thora Birch actually looks nice in shiny gold raiment riding a dragon, and of course has that adorable face.  But there's nothing like the depth of her performance in American Beauty to make anyone notice her.  The CGI effects get a bit tiresome, and the final climactic dragon battle scene only works as wallpaper in the background.  A couple of scenes in bars also could have been omitted and the background noise of alien creatures that are not from the D&D game has been done and done better.  It's only a distraction.My feeling is that a decent movie in this genre would do business at least as good as a Star Trek movie, and then the studios would see that the genre can invest drama and draw people.  This was a bad movie and not the movie to do that.  Perhaps the upcoming Lord of the Rings films will do better.D&D Player's Notes  The movie has virtually nothing to do with the game. None of the game system's rules seem to be in force anywhere.  Magic users don't seem to have to worry about casting times, verbal, material or somatic components to spells - as long as they have some pixie dust they can do what they want.  In one scene there is a castle guarded by humans and about 20 beholders.  For non-D&D players, Beholders are about the worst monster you can run into and don't get along with people well either.  The characters just throw a rock to create a distraction and dance right by.  Wouldn't happen in my campaign - Ridley and Snails would have been magic-jarred, disintegrated, held, petrified, magic missiled and about six other things in less than a segment.The term 'Mage' in D&D refers to a magic user who has reached at least 16th level.  In the original Advanced D&D game that requires 2,250,000 experience points.  Depending on whose rules you use, that would require said mage to have killed between 25,000 and 200,000 orcs singlehanded (if all you were killing was orcs).  You would have to make about 100 trips into the 666th layer of the abyss to fight demons to accumulate the kind of experience it takes to become a Mage.  By the time you get to mage, you are dealing with the badasses of the badasses.  Yet the 'council of mages' acts like a Republican congress confronted with the horrors of oral sex.  Not only that, but the Empress is apparently being put in a position where going to war with the council is the only way to settle conflict.  You don't get to 16th level magic user without having the ability to mediate conflicts and reach compromise.  But hey, it's just a movie.  "},{"Title":"Bark!

Sadly, having observed the words of the film critics of New York's four leading newspapers, and a few additional rants from other film critics across America, I have seen reactions that run the gamut from 'tepid extravaganza more suited to television than the big screen' to 'shamelessly banal'. In short, these reviewers have pretty much dismissed D&D and its fanbase as psychotic, mindless geeks. That, I can assure you, we are most ceertainly not.As Dr. Frank N. Furter ranted of old in The Rocky Horror Picture Show, and I quote I didn't make him for you! D&D fans, you know of the various D&D Worlds; indeed, a good many of you out there maintain your own D&D websites. Through your efforts, and by your desire to see Dungeons and Dragons The Movie, Courtney Solomon will undoubtedly have succeeded in his efforts to maintain his vision for the project a billionfold! (Huzzah!) So at this time, I would like to summon all those with a passion for Knights and their Ladies Fair, all of my Brother and Sister Mages, all of you who call yourselves Dragonlords and Dragonladies (and yes, that includes you Dragons, too!) --- you all do not need me to tell you that this movie would not have happened if it weren't for YOU. This, then, is YOUR victory --- and I, for one, will not be happy until you have seen the film for yourselves; and, by so doing, have given it the fighting chance it so richly and utterly deserves.And as far as making scapegoats out of D&D fans goes, I've warned you Mortals more times than once it's not nice to incur a Wizard's displeasure! I've more to say about this issue, but we'll save it for my next post. Until then, farewell!

The problem with him is he's constantly overacting his part making it come across almost comedic-like (he should have been more downplayed to fix this). He seems overindulged in his own badness that he just ends up being silly, losing that prime 'evil/badness aurra' found in many of the best starwars villains such as Darth Vader, The Emperor, Darth Maul, and Boba Fett. These villains don't have to say much in order to show the audience how cool they are in their look and feel onscreen. The 2nd main villain might have succeeded if not for a very distracting blue lipstick. Throughout most of his screentime this lipstick just looks plain ridiculous, and it was poor judgement from whoever approved it.Now onto the heroes, who faired much better than the villains. First is the Empress Savina, whose starwars counterpart is obviously Queen Amidala, or who could probably be compared to the Neverending Story's princess character. She just doesn't reflect to me as strong willed a character as Amidala, played by Natalie Portman, and maybe that works in the fashion that she looks too innocent to be put in charge of a whole empire. I guess I can accept that. The other female lead, Norda I think it is, is very much like a weaker version of Padme.The two thief heroes, one a roguish Han Soloish character, Ridley, and the second being what I like to call a nonannoyance lovable Jar Jar Binks (Snails, played by Marylon Wayans), are probably the best characters in the whole film beside the Dwarf (this film's R2-D2/Chewie/C-3PO?). The direction and story should have been better in some cases, which I believe could have helped these characters earn their way in the auidience's heart. As it is, it lacks in many areas that would allow it to be watched over and over again.THE STORY At the center of this movie they actually manage to bring together varying character classes and races, but not nearly as focused as I and I'm sure others would have hoped. Instead the adventuring has been clouded by the whole impending doom issue, a plot so much like the one found in Starwars Episode 1 that it makes me wonder if they weren't just making a D&D version remake rather than a new movie. Like I said before, if done right I have no problems with this, but D&D didn't quite live up.COOLNESS MOMENTS Replacing the podracing is this massive dragon war that should have been greatly expanded (the potential was cut short), and this is probably one of my biggest gripes. Here they had the chance to make one of the coolest battles in recent memory, and what do they do? Downplay it. This sequence could have made the movie watchable over and over again (or at least fastforwarding to it after tiring of the rest of the parts). Another gripe is the sword play supposedly substituting the lightsaber duels of starwars (lightning swords anyone?). Grrrrr.FINAL WORDS Should you go see it? Its basically Episode 1 without being nearly so childish and lacking many coolness moments that made Episode 1 watchable over and over again (podracing and saber duel). If you have a local dollar cinema, that's your best bet, if not, I'd say its worth watching at least once on the bigscreen. D&D fans might find a bit more in this, just don't expect more than what it is. I do wish this movie the best of luck in theatres because more movies like this (put in more capable hands) need to be made.

My friends and I have been looking forward to this movie ever since we heard that it was being made.  However, once we heard that Marlon Every Character I Play is Exactly the Same Wayans was going to play a major role in it, we continued to hope for the best, but prepared for the worst.  Just like every other movie or show I have ever seen him in, he always plays the same dorky character.  Unfortunately D&D is no exception. Kudos to the individual who likened Wayans to Jar Jar Binks.  However it would be unfair to compare Ahmed Best (the person who played Jar Jar) to someone like Wayans.  You have Keenan Ivory.....talented and funny.......Damon Wayans.....likewise.....and the rest of the Wayans family. Marlon Wayans proves again that he is a black hole of talent.  No script could've saved this movie with him in it, unless he was killed by a Gelatinous Cube in the first scene.  There was only one point in the movie where my friends and I cheered.  I will admit, however, that there were some parts where we actually laughed at something he said.  But I'm sure that a chimpanzee could have done just as good, if not better, than he did.Ok, now that I've bashed Wayans enough, I digress.  The special effects were great.  The spellcasting, the dragons, etc. were absolutely enchanting (bad pun, I know).Jeremy Irons.....sigh.....I expected much more from the man who gave life to Scar in the Lion King.  Don't get me wrong, he played a semi-decent villain....even though every single line that came out of his mouth was overacted (then again, D&D villains are usually stereotypical, right?).Thora Birch......laughable as the empress.  To be fair, there were times where she seemed to have some actual conviction in her voice....unfortunately they were few and far between.Everyone else did a pretty decent job.Quick question, did anyone else notice that every time they showed the door closing (in the maze) it was higher each time they showed it?This was one of those movies where you walk out with a big red handprint on your forehead from going DOH! every couple of minutes.

My biggest problem with people acting in fantasy movies is that they never become part of the story they're always too exaggerated.  I guess this is their attempt to seem fantastical. The elf, the Guild thief, and the guy with the blue lips are the only ones who seem to be part of the story.  The rest seem like they're about to do an aside at any moment. It was the Ridley show without a doubt. D&D to me has always been about teamwork. This movie had one character doing all the work while the rest ran around being incompetent and clumsy.  The dragons were nothing more than beasts rather than the intelligent creatures that they are in the game. The beholders were done well, but they also were nothing more than stupid beasts; distracted by a rock being thrown. Anyone who has played this game knows how well that would have worked. The sexual tension between the two main characters was boring. One of the characters dying served only to save us from his poor performance. Jeremy Irons was like a spoiled child rather than any sort of menacing force. Why is it we're plagued with villains who are overly verbose? Keep it simple people come on. I just thank god there were no cute, cuddly creatures to tug at our heartstrings. The object of their quest, the red dragon scepter, looked like an old prop Krull.

This film proves that Hollywood has no respect for fantasy lovers.Nor does it seem to have any respect for actors.  Jeremy Irons could have been a bright spot in an otherwise rotten film, but he was poorly directed, alternating between wooden and melodramatic overacting.  Narrative flow is lacking in this film, and scenes meant to be powerful or moving come across as dead and plodding.  One scene which I gather was supposed to be an intimate moment between two lead characters simply lead to guffaws of laughter from the audience who had come to see this film.This film struck me as something that has no respect for its audience, and no respect for its source material.  I felt, at times, like I was watching a satire of a typical Dungeons and Dragons game.  I think most of the problems lie in incompetent directing, because I know that some of the actors, like Jeremy Irons and Marlon Wayans, can actually act decently, when given good material and a good director.There is little that is good about this movie.

I liked Dragonslayer, I liked Ladyhawke, and I really liked Dragonheart.I really hated Dungeons and Dragons.  I've read and analyzed screenplays for a living, and a screenplay--a believable STORY--was precisely what this thing was missing.  I don't mean realistic, I mean believable.  To get realistic they'd have to get rid of the dragons.  To get believable they'd have to replace the entire script with the words copper conducts electricity.I'll start with the dialogue  I agree with the guy from CNN.com, who said, It's so poorly executed, you start to feel like you're watching the world's most expensive script run-through.  To me, it sounded like the whole thing was originally written in the native tongue of Prague (where D&D was filmed) and then meticulously translated.  I will, I shall, Do you not see . . . The screenwriter apparently concluded that the way to affect a Mediaeval atmosphere is to drop all your consonants and talk about the plot (or lack thereof) at length.And as for that plot--what happened?  The best I could figure was that the main conflict consisted of Jeremy Irons' desire to control dragons, and by extension, the kingdom.  So he tries to make a dragon-controlling stick, but fails, so he tries to make the Empress give him her dragon-controlling stick.  In the meantime, a group of heroes go off to find their own dragon-controlling stick.  (The reason they need their own, I guess, is so that there is something to fight about at the end.) SPOILER ALERT Here are just a few of the plot holes1)  In the beginning, Jeremy Irons is working on his green-dragon-stick down in his own little dungeon under the city.  He tests it on a dragon. Question  Where did he get this dragon?  How the hullabaloo did he get it past security, and if he didn't need to get it past security because this dragon was known to exist in the sewers, then why wasn't it being guarded by the Empress?  Why, at the very least, wasn't the population living in fear that this dragon would come out and eat them someday?  (You may argue that they DID know about the dragon, but if that were true our heroes would have known why the river was burning.)2)  Nobody can read that red scroll.  It is the only clue to the whereabouts of the red-dragon-stick.  There are no other dragon-sticks.  Only our good and faithful empress has one--the gold-dragon-stick.  Question  If right now the only dragon-stick in existence is a GOOD dragon stick, why pursue a BAD one that has, up to now, been safely hidden?  If you say, Well, it's not the dragon-stick that is evil, only the person using it then tell me why Ridley couldn't just call out the dragons to save his friends?  No, no, no--he has to GIVE the stick to the bad guy because he TRUSTS him not to lie.  Right.3)  The final battle.  The Empress had the dragon-stick.  All the bad guys had was attitude.  Tell me, why didn't she just lock herself in her room, put a dragon at the door, and say, I dare you to anyone who tried to take it from her?  Then she wouldn't have to start a war.  At the very least, she could have waited for the RED dragons to start it.4)  I have NO idea what that ending meant.Finally, I always said you could judge a bad actor by how they use their eyebrows.

It seems like they had cool stuff they wanted to show in the movie and just jumped from scene to scene with little logic or forethought. The worst part were scenes that looked like they had been stolen directly from the Star Wars movies... The only thing this movie has going for it is awesome special effects. For the dragon fight scene alone I would recommend people see this movie in the theater. If you're not into dragons, just move on to another film.

This wizard, Profilon, played by Jeremy Irons has mystical powers, such as the ability to craft long, overly-melodramatic speeches and overact at every turn.  Hilarious!  His sidekick, the loveable blue lipstick-wearing level 17/15 dual-classed lackey/goth, Damodar, played by Bruce Payne, runs around trying to find the heroes, the magic item, the map, and dignity, while accompanied by a thinly-veiled Imperial March.Meanwhile, a bunch of heroes also try to find the magic rod (eh...) for some reason.  There's Marina, the relatively useless mage who stands by idly while the hero, Ridley fights the bad guys.  Ridley is accompanied by the obligatory Wayans Brother and special friend, Snails.  There's also a dwarf, Elwood Blues, and an elf, Norda, both of who are along for the ride as long as they don't have to do anything useful to help Ridley.  The latter has a Star Trek communicator that allows her face to appear in a magic mirror, mirror on the wall of Thora Birch, who wields the power of golden dragons and Liberache's wardobe.  On their travels, they meet the King of Thieves, Nilus, who leads them all in a rousing rendition of Time Warp (well, maybe not), a talking skeleton in the cave on Dagobah, and an elven healer.  The Doctor is also accompanied by two creepy little Phantom of the Opera understudies who give Ridley a magical lightsaber +1 which he uses to battle his enemies while the other heroes sit on a log and take a nap.Oh, and of course this movie couldn't be called Dungeons and Dragons without dragons.  You see, dragons are mystical creatures engineered by McDonnell Douglas who shoot each other down and eat people.  They're also equipped with magical fireball missiles with which to take out surface targets.  The movie ends when everybody, hero and villain, dies.Be that as it may, my review isn't that negative.  This movie may not be good, but it's a lot of fun in the so bad it's good way.  The effects are good for the budget, especially when it comes to magic, and the dragons are pretty good for low-end CGI.  Throw in the over-blown dialogue and good clean enthusiasm from the writers and director, and the over-the-top performances (especially by the funny Jeremy Irons, inspired by the melodramatic Bond villains of yesteryear) and you've got yourself something you might enjoy, provided the movie is at a discount price and the rest of your $8 goes to liquor.

If you go into this thinking they're making a serious action-adventure film, based in the deep, involving world that is Dungeons & Dragons, you will HATE this movie with every essence of your being. However, if you decide to go have fun and laugh at a really entertaining movie, then RUN to this theater and enjoy the marvel that is D&D.First off, there's Thora Birch. Beautiful girl. Her acting, however, isn't worth a gold-piece here. This girl has the on-screen talent of a Bug-bear on Valium. Let me just say, that her costume did more acting than her. You remember in _The Princess Bride_ when Robin Wright is watching the old woman saying Boo! Boo! Boo!? Well, that scene of Robin pretty much sums up every scene in this movie that has Birch in it. I'm not _trying_ to say that Thora Birch is a bad actress, I can attribute her REALLY bad performance here to bad scripting and even worse direction....Then, I have to agree with Harry Knowles from AICN, when he states that Jar Jar Binks has an incredible role in this movie as the dim-witted sidekick. He even has the floppy ears (boots on head) and everything throughout half the movie! I'm also amazed at how the makeup crew got him to look so much like a Wayans brother. The typically un-funny Jar Jar Wayans does what any stupid sidekick should do in a movie...jumps around bumping into things and saying DAMN! (ala Martin Lawrence) waaaaaay too much. This character actually is kinda noble though, and there's a good part in D&D where I actually like what they do with the character...I think they should've done this to Jar Jar in E1...See this movie and you'll know what I mean.There's Elwood the Dwarf, who's MUCH taller than any real dwarf should be. He's alright, but needs a whole lot less lines in this movie. And why the heck is he using the BACKSIDE of the Axe!? The FRONT has the BLADE! Anyway...I digress...he's a sub-standard character...Justin Whalin. Jimmy Olsen from the Lois and Clark Superman show. He plays Indiana Jones and Han Solo in this movie. *** Little Spoiler *** There's a part in the dungeon/maze where he picks up the eye of the dragon...I'm really surprised he didn't rub his chin and pour the bag of sand out weighing it in one hand.... *** End of Spoilers *** He's actually pretty stifled in this role to what his acting talents can do...I think, given a good WB series or something, he could become the next James Van Der Beek (May God have mercy on our souls).Tom Baker, yes Dr. Who himself!!!!! He plays the Leader of the Elves....a noble role, but it totally lacked something.....hmmm...the TARDIS, K-9! That's IT! Actually, when he came onscreen, he, like another actor I'll talk about next, totally out-performed everyone else in this film. This isn't just a fan-boy talking here...Tom Baker made this movie REALLY worth watching. The two and a half minutes he's on-screen, made my poor little heart jump out of its coronary cavity and into the back of my throat. It's not only startling to see him with pointy ears (Spock anyone?), but it's more startling to see just how old he looks here without the red afro, or his scarf, which I think I saw hanging on the wall behind him, not sure, I'll have to look again...Richard O'Brien, yes, it's Rif-Raf. He plays the leader of the Thieves' Guild. Actually, like Tom Baker, he overpowers all of the other actors on the screen. He does a pretty good job here...he's limited by the script too much though.Jeremy Irons is REALLY over the top in this film. I thought he was a bit too much in Die Hard with a Vengeance, but here, he takes it a LOT farther. Oh man, I can't imagine anything more out there. He does play the role well, but he lacks a lot of dimension I was expecting with his character. Think Skeletor fused with Megatron, and you'll have - Profion.Zoe McLellan...She's hot...'nuff said. Her role should've been cast to Yasmine Bleeth, however.Bruce Payne...All I can say is GET THAT CRAP OFF YOUR LIPS! Yeesh...what were they thinking! Blue Iridescent Lipstick just doesn't look right on a certifiable badass.Okay...enough about the acting...This movie is basically crap, and it revels in it. It's not pretentious. It knows exactly what it is, and makes no effort to be otherwise. You really have to respect the writers and the producers for that.Like I said before...this movie is FUN to watch!!! GO SEE IT.

AD&D was by far my favorite game.  All the while, I would think about how they could make an incredibly good movie about it, because of the imagination of so many great writers out there that have put out the concepts in rule books, modules, and magazines.  With today's special effects capabilities and advanced scientific theory, the time right.  But this is not the case in this movie offering.This movie reduces what could have been, either the Dragonlance trilogy or a Forgotten Realms story, into a mix-up of the stale stuff that we've seen in other movies.  We have the hero that doesn't know his own potential, (and we don't even understand what this so-called special potential is, either, after it is revealed.) He has a cornball friend who belongs more in a comedy from the present than he does in a period fantasy piece, and of course we have them being chased by the bad guy dressed in black.  The races in here are hardly dealt with as anything other than a cameo that looked and behaved human enough to not even warrant being shorter or pointy eared.The special effects are sub-par, with many television shows and even some of the video games I have played having more spectacular things to show for their efforts.  The dragons moved in a jerky motion, and their body parts did not move together well.  Liquids were fake looking, snakelike/tentacle things were jagged around the edges, and most things that were computer generated did not move life-like or even look very life-like.The only redeeming quality of this movie is that it shows that they are willing to make an official Dungeons & Dragons movie.  I can only hope that they decide to do something as spectacular and serious as the Dragonlance trilogy to redeem themselves instead of another one-shot of silly bickering heroes trying to thieve their way through places, bumbling around and making noise like a couple of dorks, only to get caught up in a huge mess where they have to save an entire kingdom.Please, give us heroes that deserve to be praised as heroes, because of their strength, their integrity, and their actions.

As of yet, I haven't found a critic that was nice to this movie...so I went in with the worst of expectations.  About 15 minutes into the movie I stopped looking for it to be bad and sat back and enjoyed it.This movie is VERY visually pleasing.  The effects are entertaining, well done and serve a great purpose to further the fantasy world.  What you have to get past is that this movie just simply tries too hard.  This all begins with Marlon Wayans.  He is out of place from the word 'go'.  Bruce Payne (as Damodar) makes a nice bad guy, but every line he delivers sounds like he wants it to be his most dramatic line of the movie.  In doing this, he makes his character weaker because NOTHING he says has dramatic impact.  However, he does play a bad guy well.  Jeremy Irons also overacts in numerous cases, but for him it works very well.  As the head villain, an eccentric performance defines his character.The thing that makes the movie good is the solid performances from young stars Justin Whalin (Ridley) and Zoe McLellan (Marina).  While the writers and directors tried and failed to make Ridley into another Luke Skywalker, they did succeed in giving him a pretty nice personality that many fans of the paper and dice game will enjoy.  It's the kind of character you want to play...someone who shakes off his outer image and lifestyle of crime to become an unsuspecting hero.  Marina makes a good love interest for the hero, and she also plays the role of sidekick well.  Her arrogance as a high society mage is easily visible at the beginning of the movie but as she grows attached to her companions you see that slip away.  It's a really nice transition.There are some really nice battle scenes, large and small.  The melee combat between Damodar and Ridley is of high quality, while not altogether believeable.  But the movie's climax is the incredibly large battle sequence involving a countless number of dragons.  It's something no DM could ever orchestrate, but wow...it's something to see.If you're looking to find out how Thora Birch does in this movie, well, I'll just leave her out of the review.  She's in the movie for a whole of about 15 minutes and doesn't give a memorable performance.  It's not bad, it just isn't good.  It's not anything.  Her role could have been played by any of a dozen other people.  All they did was dress her up to look like Queen Amidalla, and it didn't work.  She's a bit player while being the center of the storyline.  It doesn't take away from the overall enjoyment of the movie, though.Overall, this movie is a 6 out of 10.  If you're not a player of AD&D and don't enjoy the fantasy element you will hate this movie.  For the rest of us, it's certainly worth seeing once just because it's not as bad as you might think.

It was everything I hoped it wouldn't be.My greatest source of irritation was Bruce Payne's character, Damodar. His costume makes him look like a super-villain from a comic book, he plays the part of a text-book bad guy (complete with a gravelly whisper of a voice) , and he wears metallic blue lipstick throughout the film!The armor and many other elements of costuming looked very synthetic, and the magical rods looked like something stolen from an episode of the Power Rangers.I also believe the writers should have stuck with the action/thriller theme and skipped the attempts at humor altogether, which only end up slowing down the plot.On the plus side, it does have dragons galore, and even though they are a little obviously CGI, they are the best part of the film.  Many of the myriad of races from the D&D world are represented, with Kristen Wilson portraying an elven ranger very adequately (although I don't believe any ranger would be caught dead wearing pink).I realize that the target audience was probably a little younger than I am, but there are a lot of gamers out there who are well out of their teens, and this film would have done better to target that crowd.  I hope New Line wasn't counting on the profits from this film to help budget the upcoming Lord of the Rings trilogy, because if they were, they may have to go to the bank and apply for a loan.

He mumbled so much, I couldn't understand half of what he was saying. It sounded like he had a mouth full of gum. Damedar looked like an idiot with the blue lipstick he was wearing, and Marlon Wayans was in full annoying force as the grating Snails the thief.The script was awful, the acting was pathetic, and half the scenes were rip-offs of Return of the Jedi.

The feeling as the camera moves around the outside of the CGI castles and sewers is  amazing, as are the dragons and various spell effects. The few fight scenes are fairly well done, especially the large one at the climax of the film.The entire budget was obviously exhausted on CGI, as the plot is paper thin, and the acting very bad. Jeremy Irons gives a typical, over-acted rendition of the crazy, evil wizard. The character of Damodar played by Bruce Payne fits every conceivable stereotype, with the usual bad guy quotes from other films such as the usual give me what I want and I'll let your friends go, and the typical grunting and other monosyllabic phrases. Justin Whalin and Marlon Wayans are competent in the fight sequences, however their characters are completely flat, we learn nothing about them during the whole course of the film. Thora Birch is completely laughable as the empress, I could not take her seriously at all. Zoe McLellan, while talented, was obviously included because she is attractive and Whalan's character needed a female interest, not because the character of Marina was useful.Tom Baker's cameo was a pleasant sight, though.If you enjoy bad movies, you'll love this, if not, stay away.

However, I think that I can still afford a nice chunk of objectivity since I'm not as fascinated with it as much as I used to be.... er, I still love fantasy/sci-fi, but I've moved well past the game.That said, this movie blows. It's bad on top of bad. The plot (an easy target for most critics) is disjointed at best. Dialog is trite and characters are shallow. In a nutshell, all of the things that make a movie a story are missing.But true to hollywood, the fx are very decent except for a few cases that I'll overlook as petty - well, petty with respect to the movie's many other shortcomings.If you are a D&D fan, you might be able to view the film more liberally because you understand what, at least, is being attempted. However, if you are not a fan, then this flick probably drives home with thunderous finality that D&D is a dorky, has-been game played by socially averse, above-average intelligence teenagers with such unwaivering devotion to their cultish obsession that they will overlook even the most horrible transgressions against filmmaking and storytelling in general.But you don't have to take my word for it, go see the film.

Some of the supporting cast really hammed it up, but overall I was rather pleased with the acting and the casting. The special effects were pretty good overall, especially the city scenes, though I didn't really care for the dragons themselves.The plot was utter drivel. Most D&D adventures don't have much plot to go on, but this was even weaker than you might expect. The emotional scenes seemed rather contrived. The score was awful, reminiscent of a 70s or 60s science fiction movie. The script was bad, several characters and scenes were only there to make it more D&D, and it really didn't stay terribly true to the property.

The editing is extremely rough and amateur, a plot is only vaguely implied, and the characters have about as much charisma as extras pulled onto the set at the last minute.  The film flows so poorly as to almost seem like several different films edited together.I expected that this film was aimed at someone like myself a fan both of the game and of the fantasy genre, and a big Irons fan to boot.  None of the characters (and their obscure motivations) were like anything one would encounter in the D&D game or in fantasy fiction (and should probably go back to whatever MTV show they were discovered on).  There was very little swordplay, very little magic, and whilst there were a few dragons, we never find out what their role is in the film.  They just sort of appear as required props.  A very odd, hypnotically unpleasant film that wears one out like an endless trip to the grocer's, where when you finally get to the checkout, you find your cart is empty.High marks however for Zoe McLellan, who acts with grace and beauty and deserves much better roles.

As a familiar one, I can tell you that our 4th Grade gaming sessions displayed better improvised lines that those that came down the Hollywood gristle-mill this time. If you're unfamiliar, you could possibly just sit back and enjoy the ridiculous contortions of Jeremy Irons and Bruce Payne, who seem to be intent on screwing enormous amount of absurdity out of every hackneyed line (50% prediction rate, I guarantee you, try it). Also easily identifiable are scenes stolen from Lucas movies, of which I could identify about 7 or so. Justin Whalin does about as well as any Backstreet Boy in his attempts at heroism and thespianism. Zoe McLellan and Thora Birch are easy on the eyes, hard on the film sensibilities, and have a penchant for acquiring Renaissance Fair-yet-GAP-like outfits for inappropriate settings. What wonderful stereotypes to include in a medieval setting! Kristen Wilson, geared for battle in a push-up bra that could put an eye out, has the duty, along with every other elf character in the film, of making contradictory, ridiculous, off-hand remarks about what was meant-to-be. The fight scenes are mildly fun, and so, interestingly enough, is the work of Marlan Wayans. Episode I and this movie both sucked, but this one was so terrible you stopped trying and watched some of the offered clowning, which was, indeed, much better than Jar-Jar offered. In fact, Wayans' character could be the only one you could accuse of having a personality. Even the old rule about bad-guy being good in bad action movies is violated here; Payne and Irons seem to have trouble separating who is the smart guy and who is the tough guy. Unless, of course, the rule applies to Richard O'Brien, who pimps out a nice Thief Guildmaster into yet another film-not-as-good-as-Rocky-Horror. All-in-all, don't go unless you can enjoy being disgusted, and have a theatre full of like-minded highbrows who won't care when you shout Snails...He's My Father! during the Ewok-City ripoff scene.... "},{"Title":"I REALLY wanted it to be good.","Date":"9 December 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":"  Dungeons & Dragons (1/2 Star out of Four) WARNING This review contains SPOILERS. If in reading this, I somehow `ruin' the movie for you, you may thank me now. I just saved you the cost of admission.Dungeons & Dragons is a film based on the table-top game of the same name which revolutionized board games in the late seventies and early eighties. The game helped to bring the fantasy genre into the mainstream for a short while. During its most popular era, you could have seen Conan the Barbarian, Dragon Slayer, Ladyhawk, Willow or others make it to the big screen. In fact, the game itself is created by its own players - each one helping create an ongoing story about made-up characters and plots.So why, oh why, in the movie version do we then get THESE characters and THESE plotlines? The creators of this film have boasted that first time director Courtney Solomon is a long-time DnD'er, himself. He knows how the world ought to look. He understands the difficulty in making the fantasy genre accessible to the bulk of the movie-going audience. One way of doing this might be to write a universal theme of a struggle for power, that focuses on deep character development, relationships and the politics of a monarchy. Then later, you come in and add the pageantry, the special effects and the action sequences.Or, I suppose, another way is to shamelessly recycle other movie scenes, while cranking out page after page of painfully wooden and clich√©d dialogue. Consider this scene Main good guy, Ridley (Justin Whalin), squares off against main bad guy Damodar (Bruce Payne) and his group of henchman. Ridley has just exited a dungeon with its treasure and outside the bad guys are waiting for him while holding Ridley's friends, Snails (Marlon Wayans) and Marina (Zoe McLellan), at knife point. Either hand over the loot, or your friends die. Apparently they don't show movies in the city of Sumdall, because then Ridley would know (a) bad guys don't keep their word, and (b) bad guys don't like good guys. But instead, we get this exchange, which could have been easily written by a fifth grader.Ridley (after threats) No, don't hurt them!Damodar (sneering and speaking Clint Eastwood style) Then hand it over!Marina (at knife point) No, don't do it, Ridley!Ridley Alright! Here. Now let them go.Damodar (smiles evilly)Ridley (with an actual look of surprise on his face) Wait, you said you would let them go!Damodar (overly long pause while no one does or says anything) I lied. (another long pause as no one does or says anything) Kill them all. (another pause) Slowly.Ridley (more surprise looks) No!Why didn't Damodar and his small army of men just overtake Ridley and get the treasure rather than do the Mexican standoff? Why does Ridley think that Damodar will let the good guys go after he gets the treasure? And why, for all the DnD gods' sake, do they have to use dialogue that sounds like it came from a particularly poorly written episode of the Power Rangers? Folks, this is one example in a two-hour long list of exactly these sort of scenes.And here's something else that bothered me. When the young queen in an overly done-up gown addresses a court full of people about protecting the interests of her people, you'd have to gouge out your own eyes to not see that this is a direct rip-off of Star Wars Episode I. In fact, the whole movie is full of Star Wars thefts. Ridley dresses like Han Solo, is a thief (Han was a smuggler) and eventually ends up with a headstrong girl (like Leia). When our heroes enter a bar, they might as well use John William's `Cantina' music, because as the camera pans around, we get a whole host of stupid latex monster masks in a dark smoky room. Ridley does Luke Skywalker spins during the sword fights. He eventually faces off against Damodar, before facing his more magically-inclined master, Profion. That whole scene smacks heavily of Darth Vader and the Emporer. Near the end of the movie, Marlon Wayans' character gets killed (yeah, the black guy), while Ridley looks on from afar. Ridley screams out `NO!' At the end of the film, we discover that, at least in some way, Snails is still alive to continue aiding Ridley. Can anyone say, `Obi-wan?'Does this film's director have ANY original ideas? I mean, outside of casting Marlon Wayans in a fantasy film?In the board game, you are supplied with the monsters, the cities and some very generic character ideas. Then, real players come and breathe life into the clich√©s, adding new and original elements to it all. They give it twists. They stray from the norm, and they avoid all the cheesy dialogue they've heard in a thousand bad movies. Courtney Solomon should have done the same. "}{"Title":"Finally a movie thats not based on a comic book or tv series","Date":"9 December 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":"  As a film student and avid Dungeons & Dragons (Role-playing) player I, for the most part, enjoyed this film. From a film standpoint the cinematography and editing were relatively good. The textbook shot composition worked well for this film. The film didn't require crazy camera angles or other visual eye-candy to keep the interest of the regular movie go'er. The final battle scene in the palace tower was cool with the CG dragons engaged in battle in the background. The hand to hand combat action scenes were edited with a textbook beat and rhythm to them. I also liked the point of view camera movement on each location's establishing shot. The camera would fly and pan around the CG structure, I.E. the palace, to give the viewer this location eye-candy effect. This was cool because most directors would choose to use a still stagnate shot of the exterior of the building to show each location change. Things I didn't care for much. The movie lacked in costume design and had a bit to be desired in story. One of the main antagonist characters (Damodar played by Bruce Payne) had the worst make-up design I have ever seen. The character had this blue lipstick thing going on during the entire movie. I couldn't take this character seriously with this lipstick theme going on. Not to mention the make-up was inconsistent on a few characters during the length of the entire film. I did expect the movie to be based on more of the Magic motif of the D&D role playing game. For example the female lower level mage (Marina played by Zoe McLellan) had this kickin magical power thing going for her at the beginning of the story, this made me think that she was going to be a more powerful wizard in the story and be more of a protagonist. Again her character had all this magical power at the beginning of the story but later lost it when she could have been supporting her comrades during the hand to hand combat sequences. I half expected her to jump into a battle with a fireball or some type of other useful spell. As a veteran player of the game for almost fifteen years (But yes I do admit I'm no expert) I was wondering why the wizards didn't follow the rules that Gary Gygax had written for the role playing game. For example Marina casted this spell at the beginning of the film to capture two thieves. The spell consisted of a magical rope-like force that wrapped around the two thieves. This is where I have a problem. First she is a low-level mage. So she wouldn't contain the knowledge and power to cast such a spell. Second, as far as I remember the closest lower level wizard spell that even come close to this spell she casted would maybe be Bind or Rope Trick or even Hold Person. This spell she casted was nothing like any of those spells. Yes, I know I'm going to extremes here, but if your going to call your movie Dungeon and Dragons you should at least keep to the rules of the role playing game and use the spells listed in the book effectively. I'm not saying that they have totally strayed from the rules of the game. There were a few things that only veteran players would have noticed about the story. For example dwarves don't care for horses they prefer ponies. And elves are slender angelic creatures. Again I know as a filmmaker and screenwriter you have the power to change and create you own themes and spells or rules. I do want to thank the writers of this film for not making it some type of reality story where a group of real-life teens get sucked into some type of game porthole to find they are playing their game characters. That would have made for a BAD film. So as a movie viewer and D&D player I would suggest to others to view this film for themselves because I liked it.

Yes, Marlon was the comic relief portion, but it comes off VERY well;  never overdone.  Marlon did a very good job.  If you thought of him as Jar Jar Binks, relax;  he's not.  You may be surprised.If you are looking to compare the movie to other movies (like others here seem to want to) leave that at home.  There isn't anything original in film anymore, so get over it.  Is the Emporess like Queen Amadala?  Let's see .. they are both young and in power... sheeze, give me a break.  If anything, the Emporess does a better job in her position of power than Amadala does.  Oh, yes, there will be other comparisons - Indiana Jones, Star Wars, etc.  Seems funny that people fall back on the it imitates too many other movies excuse when they want to complain and can't do it intelligently.In short, if you are remotely interested in this film, MAKE YOUR OWN OPINION.  If you are looking to compare it to the D&D game, other movies, etc. - don't go - you won't like it.

It's hard to believe a film like this can be made, and then taken seriously by some.

Since D&D will indefinetly become a failure at the box office, and be bashed critically (for good reason) Miramax may pull back the reigns on Lord Of the Rings for fear of another box office and critical nightmare.

The effects are too heavy handed, the landscape and setting underused.  A few more countryside shots and a few less zooming up the building shots would have saved expense and added greatly to the sense of 'being there'.  Combined with the television-inspired over-the-shoulder shots and the fact that it was shot entirely too close to portray the proper 'expansiveness' required for a fantasy epic leaves it feeling more like an episode of Hercules or Xena.  If a lighter hand had been taken with the fantasy elements, it would have been a much more engrossing film.  Oh, and what's with that blue lipstick?  God in heaven...The film isn't without its good points.  The thieves are played well, but the supporting roles don't quite rise above the over-the-top dialog they're given.  The storyline is reasonable, but there are undoubtedly scenes that were cut that would have made the movie make much more sense.I have a feeling that Lord of the Rings is going to come out next year and revitalize the fantasy genre.  Once that happens D&D will just be one of the movies 'before Lord of the Rings'.It's a pity that they didn't try and make a story-driven film instead of an effects driven film.  The lower budget wouldn't have hurt a film that didn't rely so much on its effects shots to please.  I just fear that this movie will bomb and other studios will take it as a sign that fantasy films, and indeed D&D related productions aren't worth making.The bottom line?  Not a bad movie to watch if there's nothing else on, but if you're really looking for a great fantasy epic, look elsewhere.

Not for one second was I inspired by the special effects and photography as in other fantasy films. Courtney Solomon, the director, said in an article that he wants this to be a fun movie for people to enjoy, well, Solomon, the movie has to be good and believable to be fun.

Mediocre production values, manageable continuity, sometimes good sometimes poor pacing, under-developed plot, unexplained plot points, questionable casting, sub-par acting, and sometimes good sometimes horrible characterization.I have to say that I had no expectations for this film right from the beginning. The director of the picture was inexperienced, the budget was ridiculously low, and a few of the casting choices were baffling. Justin Whalin and Marlon Wayans as a duo of roughneck fantasy fiction thieves? A normally proportioned man named Lee Arenberg as a dwarf, without forced perspective or scale doubles? African-American Kristen Wilson as the film's main elf character (half-elf, actually, but they never tell the audience that in the film, I had to find out through the DVD audio commentary)? On top of that, a few casting choices one would have thought would have saved the film didn't. Jeremy Irons and Bruce Payne as the film's central villains could (should, actually) have been heavenly, but weren't. The cameos by Tom Baker and Richard O'Brien were excellent, though.When all is said and done, the central problems with this film are very evident. The first being that, Courntey Solomon, the man at the helm just did not have the background as a filmmaker required to bring something of this magnitude to the big screen. While watching the film, it is apparent that he poured his heart and soul into each scene, but lacked the polished skill to truly bring it out effectively, most of the time. If anything, the director can only be blamed for being too enthusiastic and impatient about getting to be a filmmaker of an adaptation of a role-playing game he has much love for. The other problem being the matter of budget. Solomon made the film for $35 million. Now balance that between the actors, the costumes, the props, the sets, the cameras, the film, the shooting locations, the make-up, and the computer generated special effects. Listening to the audio commentaries for the film, and watching the deleted scenes (both with or without Director's Commentary) made it clear that he had much higher ambitions for the project that were just impossible for what he had to work with. Regardless, with his own inexperience and a hideously low budget working against him, he still managed to put together a decent film. I don't think I need to explain the situation again in order to tell readers that shows promise in a filmmaker, but showing promise was not enough to make this a solidly good film.

Gary has a creative genius unceasing, and between him and all of the people who have ever written material for the games, there was enough to put together a hundred films with separate plots and character types. The problem the general public may have is that they don't understand the rules, or character types, and thus did not relate to the story.I appreciate the producer's and director's attempt to incorporate D & D material and rules into the movie, but in doing so they have made the film unwatchable by all but fans of the game. For example, the scene with the Lich, Savril (The skeleton on the rack that gave Ripley the Rod of Savril). Who but players of the game would know what he was? Thus, who but players of the game could appreciate his inclusion? Or, as another example, the Beholders (those floating balls with one big eye in the middle and tentacles with eyes at the ends). Who but a player of D&D could have known what they were, and of what they were capable? A little demonstration of their powers (each eyestalk has a different magic ability, and the center eye reflects magic aimed upon it) would have been entertaining. Alas, we only see them float through a hallway.On the other hand, I must give credit to certain portrayals. The Dwarf is exactly how I picture a dwarf to be; battlehearty, loyal, vulgar, abrupt, fearless but with weaknesses (hates horses), and avaricious. Bravo! I also applaud the portrayal of Norda, the Elf Ranger. She is as stuck up as most elves are made out to be in the games.All in all, I enjoyed the film, but they could have done better with the CGI,the acting, and the storyline.

Marlon Wayans appears to have wandered into the film by accident while Justin Whalin, much like Thora Birch, doesn't seem to know what the Hell's he doing in this mess.Zoe McLellin is slightly better than the rest, but the only thing that really redeems her here is that she appears to be a cross between Famke Janssen and Anne Hathaway.

The Dwarf was way too tall, but he made up for it with his hatred/fear of horses, insatiable appetite and his willingness to drain the tavern of every drop of ale. The Elf..well, she was NOT an Elf by any stretch of the imagination. Short black hair, dark skin, horrible costume, and her overacting wasn't much better.

Many of the comments on this movie has said that it was badly instructed, badly cast and had no plot whatsoever, well as for the plot, yes it's classical and basic but this movie is also meant as an introduction to D&D and as such should be basic in its story, what it lacks is more background on the setting ( in this case the kingdom of Izmer) as there aren't any place where you can find this in the product portfolio of Wizards. The cast haven't got any 'BIG' names like Bruce Willis or Michelle Pfieffer and this would also in my opinion had been a big mistake, instead we have some well know if not blockbuster material in the likes of Jeremy Irons as the main villain and Thora Birch as the Empress, some less prolific like Bruce Payne (Full Eclipse), Marlon Wayans (Scary Movie) and Lee Arenberg (Pirates of the Caribbean) and some unknowns like Justin Whalin, Kirsten Wilson and Zoe McLellan. As far as the acting they won't win any Oscars for their performance, but most dosn't fall flat on their buttocks either except Irons and Wayans who both over acted (espessially Wayans, but when dosn't he) and Iron comes out of this even worse than he did in Die Hard 3.

Now I think that the reason for the cheering isn't the fact that it's one of the main characters that are killed off but simply that Wayans is so annoying that anybody would be happy to see him out of the movie.Why do I like this movie when so many don't (I have even read in Dragon Magazine (Wizards own monthly magazine for D&D) that this movie was bad, it's almost like they're embarrassed). Well when I see a movie I look for gaming ideas for use in D&D games and while the idea in this movie is basic the setting is what attracts me and I hope that it's more fleshed out in the planned sequel. The reason that so many dosn't like this movie is, in my opinion that it's not something they can relate that much to as is the case with most other movies of this kind that have a more should we say equal review in the opinion of the masses, like Lord of the Rings which is a setting that most people are familiar with, as for the fans of the game well I think they're just grumpy that their favorite setting didn't get the part and since they can't get any info on this setting they have trouble interacting with it.On a final note while Bruce Payne does a good job of acting the role of Damodar, why did they give him Blue/Purple libs and so bloodshot ears, he look completely foolish which is kind of sad as it's a nice character (looking forward to seeing him in the sequel (wonder how they write his resurrection into the plot)).All in all I give this movie a 6 mainly because of that annoying Wayans, the foolish look of Damodar and the overplayed Profion (Irons) "},{"Title":"Good D&D movie","Date":"25 April 2005","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":" Hi all, this is a must for every D&D fan, despite all the negative reactions I've read over here.

This film is as visually stunning as it is daring and believable in its story and execution. The auteur, Solomon, says in an interview that he likes to take the Star Wars approach to film-making. By the finished product we can assume this means copying scenes and theme music from Star Wars and adding his own well-cast and superbly acted characters in them. For example the garbage chute reference to the garbage chute scene from star wars, is as good as his tavern scene/cantina scene but my favourite would have to be the explanation of magic as an unifying force - pure inspirational cinema.But let us talk of characters. No clich√©s here, as all the characters are definitely not 1 dimensional or lacking in motivation. And the story! Such brave writing when he kills off a main character , only to satisfy the audience by bringing him back to life at the end of the film, with no explanation whatsoever! don't question the gift...

Irons snarfs his share of the curtains, too &#150; and although he hides it much better than Payne, his tongue is firmly in his cheek, too.

One thing I can say is good though is the armor.  I have read that someone thinks that they think that the costumes were bought at a Wally World.  I for one work at a Wal-mart while going to college and i could only wish that the costumes in the movie were sold there.  The dude with lipstick's arm gauntlet alone if recreated and sold at most armor places would probably cost you over a thousand dollars which would be around the right kind of cash his type of character in the movie could afford. I know I've looked(I'm kind of an armor collector). Even the GOOD leather ones will cost you a hefty amount of cash. And with the other armors such as the girl elves breast-plate, well that in itself is what armor is, anything more would be too fancy for the movie. Not everyone in the medevil times ran around with etched breast-plates with intricate designs.  So a recreation of an elf wearing this type of armor seems somewhat accurate(come on, not even a beginner on a GAME starts out with the best armor). The plot-line seems fairly good and I for one am looking forward to a sequel if they improve on the minor mistakes of the first and keep the SAME actors (Sequels always suck if you change the actors,ALWAYS!!). Because if right type directing is given to these actors they could be awesome. So dont be such downers and hope for a new and improved sequel.I give this movie a 7 out of 10.LORD OF THE RINGS ROCKS!!!

What about a film? We got a script?. Reply, Um, we could rattle one up by Monday.Most people who look for anything from a fantasy based film are invariably disappointed, but this, I feel, was a bit ridiculous. Granted, it had some special effects that weren`t half bad, even if they didn`t look fantastically mind-boggling, but I really don`t think that was quite enough to carry the lack of plot, abysmal acting from most throughout, and all the really cheap cinematic and scripting tricks to numerous to delve into.As a kids film, I suppose it would pass muster, except for it being rated 15s, but if they`re trying to aim this at adults, its a total money-spinning sham, well, it`s that anyway. Phrases are thrown into the script from the world of D&D, maybe thought to appease afficionados of this stuff, but as a bit of light entertainment, as it would be for most, it falls flat on its face. It pulls in all directions, trying to have almost slap-stick humour through squeaky voiced black guy(Wayans), and serious drama all the way through.A particulary bad recollection is the scene when Wayans bites it, stabbed by evil stereotype deep-voiced dramatic-talking lipstick-toting mascara-wearing hired-goon. Possibly the worst scene where an actor/actress has ever done the whole NOOOOooooooo....... thing. I`m not a really a picky person when it comes to films, but I just had to say *something* about this creation.One wonders several things after this film, why Jeremy Irons would do this film - perhaps the Mafia are after him for money he owes them?? And maybe it would be better if we paid on the way *out* of the cinema, because by the time the film is over, the people who brought you said movie have long disappeared with our cash.

Even better, it takes fantasy to its extremes as, unlike most standard D&D adventures, there is no reluctance to depict thieves as heroes, insanely tall buildings (mainly towers - as one might expect of a city dominated by mages), heavy and frequent use of both standard D&D and new magic by experienced aristocratic wizards, very dramatic use of extremely powerful magical items and monsters, and an epic plot of empire-shattering proportions.  It is regrettable to think that this last point needed some improvement - but more on that matter later. Personally, I love escapism, and this film is the best way to achieve that state of mind as I have ever seen in visual form...surpassing the Star Wars The Phantom Menace, Willow, Dragonslayer, Dark Crystal, Neverending Story, and other similar movies in that regard.To complement all these extremes of fantasy, larger-than-life characters are presented as both antagonists and protagonists.  Jeremy Irons, in one of his most controversial roles, expertly plays the main villain Profion, the Empire's most powerful politician and wizard.  It is his self-appointed driven, megalomaniacal destiny to overthrow the current government and rule as some sort of dictator.  In both his private and public scheming, he sometimes shouts, rants, and raves...but this is credible when one considers that this is exactly how certain famous dictators have behaved in the real world.  Later, when Profion is on the verge of possibly obtaining his goal, he releases all his henceforth barely suppressed emotional fury so that the often unexplored territory of ultra-selfish, highly destructive naked lust for power is plain to see in all its triumphal ugliness.  Profion's henchman, the cold, brutal, and sadistic fighter Damodar embodies a common truth to so many tyrants in that they get others to do their truly dirty day-to-day work so they can retain at least some veneer of respectability.On the side of good, a few figures deserve special mention.  The main hero, Ridley, an extremely capable commoner with plenty of untapped potential, displays considerable complexity in his motivations throughout the film and even has a dark side that surfaces periodically.  Ridley's best friend, Snails, eventually shows that a less than heroic life can be redeemed. Their new adventuring companion Marina, slowly, but ably, bridges the gap between the mages and commoners on a micro-scale.  Empress Savina shows considerable passion and authority in both her brave words and actions, capably defying the accusations laid against her and behaving like a truly good, fair, but firm ruler.  Lastly, Elwood the Dwarf embodies the often amusing stereotype of his race while still providing assistance where it is needed.  To be sure, these characters and others are acted with passion and liveliness which might be too much for some viewers, but considering what is at stake in this fantasy world and how the movie does not take itself too seriously and tries and succeeds to be exciting and fun, this fact is perfectly understandable.All these characters, settings, and events are supported by a superb musical score...one of my all-time favourites.  The rousing score perfectly enhances the emotions of every single scene and is well worth a listen to on audio cd apart from the movie.  Composer Justin Caine Burnett is to be highly commended for his fantastic effort!Regrettably though, the storyline, as full of potential and frequently innovative and thrilling as it is, could have used some additional work. My main problem is the morality of using the evil red-dragon controlling Rod of Savrille.  I personally find it hard to accept that a good ruler would ever use such a device, especially if she already has a similar device that controls good dragons.  It's best for the viewer to assume that the Empress wants the Rod solely to keep it in her safe custody where she would never use it, but rather keep it from Profion's covetous clutches.  This way, good and evil are much better defined and some storyline ambiguities cleared up. Furthermore, it would have been appropriate to make the film at least half an hour longer as most people don't have the time or motivation to read the movie's supporting literature to get a firm grasp on the backstory and some of the more complex details concerning the development of the characters and the political situation.  I don't have any real problem with the film's various cliched scenes, as there are sufficient innovative scenes to balance them out and all cliches are presented in an exciting manner, backed with appropriate music and interesting characters.  D&D purists should realise that this movie does take some liberties with the game's rules, but these concerns can be explained away owing to the usual practice of having at least some new rules/spells/etc. for different D&D worlds, plus the usual constraints placed on movie makers by the nature of the film medium.I recommend this film to all teenagers and adults who desire escapism and/or a convincing, thrilling fantasy based action/adventure.  Personally, I cannot wait for the sequel (which is set up in this film).  Dungeons and Dragons is an impressive, even if flawed, effort from a first-time director who should improve as he continues in his profession after this promising start.My Rating?  8.5 out of 10!

Usually I can jump right on it and say Yes I like it or No I don't like it and explain why, but not this time. This movie is so perfectly balanced with pros and cons that rating it is difficult. The bad points the acting, for the most part, is atrocious, with occassional glimmers of sincere performing (few and far between); Ridley is horribly miscast and he looks too clean-cut and honest to be a real thief; Courtney Solomon's directing is uninspired and paper-thin, making it obvious that he really didn't know what he was doing; some of the dialogue is too modern-day and sounds horribly out-of-place; and the story, while very RPG-like in its narrative, is too predictable to be considered up to par. The good points The score by Justin Caine Burnett is beautiful and fun to listen to; the special effects are extremely well-done (particularly the dragon battle at the end); the sets are marvelous and present the fantasy world in visuals that perfectly match what a fan would expect; the costumes are very well-designed and add some charm to the characters where the actors couldn't; the creatures that appear throughout are lifelike and fun to watch; and the fight scenes are just fast-paced enough to be interesting. Usually a movie with such amateur directing, lousy writing and uncontrolled acting is impossible to watch, but the movie's overall atmosphere is so well-defined (through its music, sets, costumes and effects)that it's hard to not watch. A fan of D&D should at least give the movie a try, and maybe non-fans may enjoy it too. I watched it with low expectations and thus was not terribly disappointed, but I still could not help but think of how I would have done so many things differently. I rate it 6/10.

As an MST3K fan, i've seen some bad movies, and sure this movie deserves to be on the show (were it still running), but it would definately be one of the least painful movies.  For one thing, it's not evil, and aside from the acting, isn't too painful.  It doesn't want to hurt the audience like Battlefield Earth or Armaggedon did, its just stupid and mostly harmless.  It has some neat special effects, some okay directing, and beautiful backgrounds.However, that can't save the movie from its big failings.  For one thing, the acting is absolutely horrid!  The main characters are bad and stereotyped, Marlon Wayans is lamer than Jar Jar binks (though he tries), and we have a Dwarf character who is useless and never even given a name! This doesn't go on to the bad mages, romantic interests, and Thora Birch was just unbelievably bad!  However, seeing Richard O'Brien (of Rocky Horror and Dark City fame) was nice, even though he was pretty bad as well.But special attention must be given to the worst of the bunch, Jeremy Irons.

Having said that, it definitely wasn't the worst. I've been playing D&D for over two decades and went to see the movie on that basis. I was not disappointed, except for the low quality of acting especially the absolutely over-the-top melodramatic over-acting from Jeremy Irons. All of these actors have produced great work - I can only blame the director for some wooden and rudderless scenes. On the other hand - Tom Baker's cameo was just right. Well done, Doctor...I went into this movie with the same mindset as when I play D&D. Some players are good role-players, some are humorous and some are clever. None are all of these. It's up to each player (in the case of the movie - the audience) to get the most from what is presented. The movie fit that expectation nicely, as I could ignore the bits that were ham-fisted and look at what each event added to the experience. The dwarf was of no benefit to the story at all, but provided some excellent light relief. The magic was well represented with most spells recognisable (loved the effects!), and fitting well to the D&D verbal/somatic/material requirements, even though the material component was a non-specific 'pixie-dust'. But hey! this is a movie - I didn't expect the 15 minute rule debates we get in our games. Some simplification kept the story rolling along - which was necessary as some bits were reaaaaalllly slooooow.The dragon CGI was excellent, but they are supposed to be rare in D&D and the sight of so many was a little unbalancing to me.While the characters' racial and class attributes were a little under-played (possibly to keep the pace up), you could definitely see the fighter/thief checking for traps; the ranger tracking; the mage getting flattened by the first blow in combat and the dwarf getting his blood up and just hitting whatever moved.Before seeing D&D, I was a bit put off by a criticism of the maze. It most definitely IS a maze (def A network of paths designed as a puzzle), although not the traditional English hedge type.All in all, a good effort. If you go into the movie expecting it to be a great movie or a great D&D game on a screen, then you'll be disappointed. Go into Dungeons & Dragons for a fun time with a D&D flavour and that's exactly what you'll get.BTW, the ending screams 'SEQUEL!'. I, for one, will be waiting in line for it.

Unfortunately, I was completely incapable of overlooking the weaknesses of D&D, as I could find nothing to make me overlook them. In all honesty, had I not attended the movie with a group, I would have left halfway through. (By the way, I have NEVER walked out of a movie!)Where to start...plot? There is very little to say, other than that it could not have been any weaker and more predictable than it was! Unfortunately, the makers of fantasy movies have missed the mark for years, not understanding that good fantasy is character study. By definition, the genre has one theme good vs. evil; therefore, any attempt to make fantasy plot driven is destined to failure. It should be character driven. The characters in this movie, however, are flat. They lack depth, and the only intriguing character in the film is a dwarf, which is not surprising, as dwarves tend to be the most fun personalities in D&D.Aside from the plot, the props and makeup were ridiculous. The guy has blue lips and the magical scepter that cures all evil is PLASTIC and doesn't even look real! The dialogue is some of the worst ever written, it's crowning moment being the cheesy line Not so talented are you Mr. Ripley.

I want to know how much they paid the guy that stood beside the set reminding the actors to speak more slowly at some attempt for suspense and drama.

The plot was believable, the characters were likeable.  There was even great depth of character, an element missing in many action films.  I thought there was too much emphasis on the main characters and too little on the interesting supporting characters.  I wouldn't call it a classic tale of good verses evil but it had a good plot and interesting characters with good interaction between them.  I'm giving it a 9 out of 10 just because every one else gave it such a low rating.  It would otherwise have been an 8.  It wasn't perfect but it was a pleasing film (and I'm hard to please).  For my fellow ex-pats looking for a VCD, the one I bought was in the jewel box inside the cardboard box claiming to be a DVD rip.  This is a screen copy, the sound wasn't good in some parts but the picture is.  Better then most screen-rips. Enjoy.

Oh well, if you insist.In short this movie did everything wrong.  It's a slap in the face to anyone that has even a passing familiarity with the world of Dungeons & Dragons and is misleading to someone unfamiliar with D&D.  The fact that Courtney Solomon worked so hard to get this movie made and created this as a final product doesn't bode well for his future as a director.The acting was possibly the worst aspect.  The actors either atrociously overacted or came off as understudies from a high school drama club. Members of the former group included Jeremy Irons as the comical face-contorting master of the soft-shout, Profion and Justin Whalin as Ridley (for an example of how not to act, reference Ridley's reaction to Snail's death...classic).  Members of the latter group included Thora Birch's zombified Empress (is this life after American Beauty? Tragic) and of course the infamously terrible performance by Marlon Wayans as the irritatingly inept (and NOT funny) Snails.Perhaps all the blame can't be placed on the actors themselves.... look at what they had to work with.  The story and character development was all over the place in this movie.  Ridley can't decide if he's a thief, a warrior, or even a mage.... eventually he ends up being all three. Snails.... oh why even bother.  Marina is the mage of the party but you wouldn't be able to tell it considering she rarely ever casts any spells. The dwarf could have been easily erased from every scene and wouldn't have made any difference (I'm not exaggerating.... he really is that peripheral to the story).  The elf (played by a poor man's Jada Pinkett Smith) presumably is meant to add an air of mystery and intrigue to the party but eventually ends up stereotypically stony to fill the elf-slot.The basic plot of the movie is just that...basic.  Evil government official (what his place is I'm not sure it ever reveals) plots to overthrow the just current ruler (who happens to have a staff that controls gold dragons) by attempting to find (or send his cronies to find) a different staff that controls red dragons.  Enter two bumbling thieves (complaining of the unfair class system to set up a series of speeches later on) who try to pilfer valuables from the mage guild (basically the seat of government) and get caught up with a young mage librarian that is sent to find the red dragon staff before the evil government official does.  Throw in a dwarf and an elf eventually and you have a pretty sorry party by D&D standards.  The party eventually finds the red staff but is tricked into handing it over to the evil government official's cronies.  Fear not, however, for good triumphs over evil after a series of absurdities including a thief receiving a magical long sword (and wielding it), defeating the government official's best knight in one on one combat, besting the government official (a high level mage) in a test of will and topping it off by destroying an enchanted item (quite a feat for a low level thief).  Oh, and the government official gets eaten by a golden dragon ala Gennaro in Jurassic Park.  All the while the empress rides around on her golden dragons wearing a skimpy suit of armor and spouting equality by royal fiat.  Finally, we're treated to one of the most nonsensical endings ever conceived (you end up asking yourself if Ridley's power was to bring Snails back to life or to kill everyone else so they could see Snails again...either way that's not much of a gift).One could easily go into a laundry list of failings on the directing side of the movie.  Some pertinent scenes seem to have been left on the cutting room floor.  Scenes like Ridley and Marina's conversation inside the magic map (presumably Ridley's motivation for continuing the quest) and Ridley's prophetic fever dream.  Ridley also speaks of lessons he's learned from his father but this idea isn't ever developed.  One of the stupider scenes in the movie involves all the party members being held captive until Ridley relinquishes the red dragon staff to the evil knight, Damodar.  Once the staff is safely in Damodar's hands the party members easily escape from their captives following a painfully by-the-books dialogue exchange (something along the lines of 'You promised to release them!' countered with 'I lied.  Kill them.').  Damodar then crosses class lines (not out of the ordinary in this movie) and out of nowhere casts a transportation spell after acquiring the red dragon staff.  The climactic battle between the red and gold dragons is severely hampered by the cheesiness of the dragons' design.  And, of course, you know something is severely wrong when the most enjoyable (and genuinely funny) scene in the movie involves the death of one of the main characters. After Snails' death, Marina tries to comfort Ridley by saying I'm sorry about Snails.  That statement transcends mere sentimentality and is taken as an admission of guilt and contrition for putting the audience through an hour of his brain-dead antics.To make a long story short (too late) this movie is a waste of time and money.  Don't let anyone tell you it was good...they either hate you and want you to suffer or don't have any taste.

I've been playing this game since 1974, and had figured that, ok, it's probably going to be a good bit of an insider's movie; ya know, where you have to be familiar with the game in order to fully appreciate the thing. No dice. The best thing I can say about this intellectual insult is that, had it been someone's game that I just started playing, I'd've walked out and put the ref on my doofus list. Do not, repeat, do NOT see this film. Run in fear from it. Run far, run fast, scream in fear at the very suggestion of seeing this tripe.Here are some pet peeves (spoilers included); 1)  Where'd the beholders go to after the idjit thief tossed a rock to distract them? Were these things from the monster reject pile? Some guards. 2)  Here we had two thieves breaking onto some sort of wizards school making all sorts of noise while climbing down the rope. Yet, once they have tumbled into a noisy pile on the floor, then the brighter of the two cautions to be silent. 3)  When Ridley derides Marina, he actually comments that she is `low level.' C'mon, people, level is an abstract in the game and not a quantity that you wear around your neck on a sign. 4)  The show culminates in some sort of dragon war that Profion and Savina get into. Well, I don't know about you, but any city subjected to that much dragon power should be nothing but rubble. Anyway, this dragon war is between Red Dragons and Gold Dragons. Taking a quick gander at my copy of D&D, I see that the Gold Dragons should have pulverized the Reds without even breaking a sweat. 5)  Thieves Guild Maze. Snort. Three room, one corridor `maze.' Need I say more? 6)  The two thief characters seemed to be taken straight from some inner city in the US. Nothing like hearing colloquial American slang in a medieval fantasy environment.Hopefully, LoTR will cure me of my fantasy film malaise. As Tolkien was the basis for D&D in the first place, I guess there's no better film idea than LoTR to be a D&D environment.

This was by far the worst movie I have seen in the theater since I went and watched Muriel's Wedding about 5 years ago.  I went into this thinking this can't be that bad.  After all it has Oscar winner Jeremy Irons in it, and Thora Birch from the Oscar winning movie American Beauty.  Boy was I ever wrong.  I have never seen this much bad acting by a whole group of actors in my life.  Usually in a movie that has bad acting you have at least one person who is believable.  Not here buddy.  All I could think of while watching this was that they all, except for the exception of Thora Birch, had gone to Bill Shatner's School For OVer the Top Acting.  Thor Birch, on the other hand, 95% of the time she sounded like she was reading her lines from cue cards.  I really think that the only reason she played the angst ridden teenager so well in American Beauty, is because...MAYBE SHE IS AN ANGST RIDDEN TEENAGER!  At least after this movie she should be angst ridden at her agent. The only two good things about this movie where Marlon Wayans, who was killed about half way through, and the dragon fight at the end.

I was a bit of a D&D geek back in high school. Believe me I know my way around a twenty sided dice. With that said it was pretty much inevitable that I would find my way to the theatre to watch this flick in spite of the less than favourable reviews. The good news is that I stayed until the closing credits (mainly to see who the director was so I could avoid his future work at all costs). The bad news is that this is the worst movie I've seen since Highlander 2. Why is it that the characters in every fantasy movie have to speak with bad British accents? And why are elves always represented as being emotionless and coldly intellectual. I have yet to see a fantasy movie where the elf character is more than a Vulcan with a longsword. And talk about terrible acting. Go watch Thora Birch in American Beauty and then catch her in this disaster. It's like they've got her doped up on cold medication. She enunciates each syllable in slow motion as if even she can't believe how bad her dialogue is. I won't even begin to talk about Jeremy Irons but I will say it's really hard to take his main henchman (kind of a Darth Vader without the helmet) seriously when the guy wears blue lipstick. What's up with that? I kept expecting his backup singers to show up.Story wise, the struggling Empress routine is far too similar to Phantom Menace. There's really nothing new here at all. Pick any detail of this movie and it's been done somewhere before. Any D&D nerd will tell you that the potential storylines for this genre could fill a +5 bag of holding. But in spite of that, the filmmakers settled on what amounts to a yard sale of recycled gags and cheap thrills. Even the effects, which are few and far between, are pretty weak. The dragon in Dragonheart was a lot more realistic and that movie was made like a million years ago!All in all, I've gotta respect that this is Courtney Solomon's first crack at being a director and he went to the Nine Hells and back to have it made. Unfortunately, I think this is going to set first time directors back for many years to come. Make your saving throw and avoid this movie at all costs. Spend your ten bucks on a new set of dice.

Do not read if you haven't seen the movie.This movie is SO disappointing that maybe is not as bad as I think. But is BAD. OMG it is BAD. One would think that doing a movie about D&D has some inherent advantages An endless supply of ideas; there are SO many scripts, novels, adventures and books that it would be difficult NOT to find a good script for the movie. Well, they managed to find the WORST script I've ever seen in years. Stallone's movies have better scripts. Another advantage is that D&D is such a popular game that have half of the magical mood already set for it. Well, they manage to kill it. D&D is about fantasy, drama, legends, quests, characters... and they have turned it into a poor comedy, with no sense, no magic and no legend. It is VERY POORLY directed. In particular, the actors. Here we have a group of good actors that could do (and have proven it several times) a great job. But... they don't. And it can be seen that it is not their fault. They scream, smile, cry, sob and laugh at the wrong times. Some people say that Jeremy Irons overacts. NO WAY!, he acts... and by doing so, by comparison to the rest, it looks like he overacts. The problem here is that the director wasn't able to set an acting scale for the movie. Justin Whalin (Ridley) is not a bad actor, but in this movie, he smiles in dramatic moments, he seems relaxed in tense scenes, etc. Not his fault IMHO. Same with the rest, with the exception of Marlon Wayans, that just doesn't fit in this movie. (spoiler) His death instead of a dramatic moment is a relief for everybody. (EVEN MORE SPOILERS) Going back to the script and some other details, here are some random mistakes that come to my mind. - A 3 room maze? OMG! are you kidding me? Everybody in the movie can actually see what traps each room has, there are only 3 rooms and they try to convince us that no one has ever finished? Are the thieves blind or stupid?- Final scene in the maze... check the way Ridley checks for traps.- At the castle. 3-4 beholders with human patrols all over the castle? What is that about? And then, when they finally get in, suddenly all the troops disappear and only Damodar (Bruce Payne) is left to deal with the thieves.- So Ridley and Snails are thieves? What kind of thieves fall in all the traps, cannot whatsoever walk in silence, break and hit everything, etc.- The elves are soooo smart that they give Ridley a magic sword and they don't tell him what it does.- Ridley, with that sword suddenly is a match for Damodar.... and when he looses the sword and uses a log... still is a match for him! Nice...- Talking about swords... NONE of them were sharp... i mean they were OBVIOUSLY DULL. Luckily Damodar stabs Ridley in the shoulder, had he tried to slash him he would have achieved nothing but some bruises.- Axes. Please, give the Dwarf a real axe. BTW, the dwarf NEVER uses the axe in the movie... he kind of swings it around but never hits anyone. What is the dwarf actually doing in the movie? A Mystery.- The dwarf is taller than the elf.- Characters appear and disappears from the scene without any logic. Example When they get into the thieves guild, the Dwarf is taken away for no reason to later appear back again, still for no reason.- When Ridley finally gets to the cave and for no reason he is the only one allowed to get in. They build some tension and mood.... for nothing. A lame, difficult to understand conversation with a talking corpse. What kind of thief finds a treasure and only takes the wand? What about the gold and weapons around?- Yet another scene of Give me the weapon or I kill the girl. Gives the weapon, the bad guy tries to kill the girl anyway and he fails, because suddenly AFTER they gave away the weapon, EVERYBODY sets themselves free and they kick their captors booty. Topical, weak, poorly done.- Council of mages... ? or was it a council of Barbarians? One would think that Mages are highly intellectual people not easily surrendering to their passionate side.... Still the mages council looks like a Vikings meetingThese are only some of the things that come to my mind right now.

Those of you who spent your $7.00 to see a great piece of cinematic art should have your head examined. . . .I think everyone on the planet knew that this movie, just as every other fantasy movie, was going to be full of hammed-up acting.  I was pleasantly shocked to notice that, to say the very least, the acting (which, by fantasy movie standards was excellent) did not deter from the movie in any way.I am reminded of such movies as Mortal Kombat,Double Dragon,Mortal Kombat II and other such movies that I had to walk out or assume the risk of becoming a slave to commercialism.This movie was better than StarWars Episode One (SWE1).  First of all, one of the main reasons I did like this movie so much was because every time I turn on the TV now, I'm not bombarded by commercials showing some little green alien thing driving a taxi cab in search of tooth-rotting cola drinks. How many times can one watch this commercial before boycotting Pepsi and George Lucas alike?!Secondly, I had no expectations about this movie with the exception of the basic rules of D&D.  What I mean is, the movie stuck to the rules very well thieves can read scrolls, mages are usually thrown to the ground and sit in a fetal position during melee, and warriors wearing plate mail Damodar cannot, and did not, run.  So my only apprehension was satisfied.  With SWE1, I was expeciting to see some GREAT movie that would change my life forever!  Instead, I waited in line and spent my $6.25 to see a 2-hour long commercial for SW video games and t-shirts.Thirdly, this movie did not contain a toddler figure for all the little babies to like.  I'm refering to those ewok things, and Jarjar Binks (or however to spell his name).  These characters are meant to milk the last of society's money out of people by appealing to an age group that really doesn't understand what the movie is about, but they wished that ewoks did exist and could conquer the imperial storm troopers.Lastly, unlike SWE1, this movie was totally new, totally uninhibited, it actually had a purpose in being made.  I watched SWE1 and basically knew everything that was going to happen.  Did you NOT know that Qui-gon Jin (or however you spell what's his face's name) was going to die when he did? Did you not know Aniken (or however. .. you get the picture) was going to win the race and, thus, win his freedom?  There were twists in D&D that I thought were great, and were very original.  Also, the D&D movie was made of course, to make money but also to introduce this genre of movies to a whole new generation; I believe it is succeeding very well (better than what I had imagined it to do).  SWE1, of course not only introduced a new generation of Star Wars, but also to the dismal science of Economics and the smoke-and-mirrors art of Marketing.In conclusion, keep in mind that it is the notoriety of D&D that ultimately made it so popular that a movie was made in its behalf.  If everyone liked D&D, it would have suffered the same fate as SWE1.  And I'm not defending my appeal for this movie simply because I used to play D&D; on the contrary, I was probably more critical than you were.  And I don't like movies simply because of content or who wrote or directed them (George Lucas and Jane Campion come to mind).Vermut  "},{"Title":"Hopefully, a good starting ground...","Date":"11 December 2000","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":"  For a film that can mostly be considered an independent film (Made without the backing of any major movie house)..For a film that was kicked around for 10 years before finally coming to fruition..It is a good start.Everyone comments on the overacting (Irons as Super-Evil, Payne as Super-Dramatic, Birch as Super-Whiny) it appears that once again - people have forgotten that movies are sometimes just supposed to be fun.I sat there not knowing how the outcome would go in each scene.  For the first time in a while, I was in a movie not sure if or when a protagonist was going to bite it.There were times when I felt teased - like 'The Maze' - I expected there would be just one more trap, another challenge, something truly sinister.

Note Do not meet Profion and Damodar(sp?) in a dark alley. Try not to meet them at all. That aside, as I said, it was a great movie. I've heard alot of people say how the acting was terrible, but I didn't see it that way. I found the characters very real, something I also haven't seen in a while.

Not a lot is explained, but I've heard there is to be a sequel, which means everything most likely will be explored in greater detail. My advice, if you can't stand not having everything spelled out for you, then don't watch this movie. It's a rare(unfortunately) breed of movie that challenges the viewers to pay attention.

But therein lies the biggest problem. Dungeons & Dragons is not just a novel or a video game, it is a canon unto itself with a wealth of material that gives the likes of Superman a good contest. And because of the nature of the game, every story in Dugeons & Dragons, even if it is not necessarily entertaining or compelling, has a certain depth that is absent from this film. A good example would be the Eye Of The Beholder games. Even at their worst, the story that drove the adventures was replete with twists and turns that would have made a great motion picture. Not having played the actual game myself, even though I own one of the handbooks, I did not have any specific expectations when going into this film adaptation. Other than a decent story and some passable acting, that is. So when the first five minutes of the film passed, I was dumbfounded. Utterly dumbfounded.Aside from the overly dramatic score music and poorly-written narration, the first thing you will gawk at in Dungeons & Dragons is Bruce Payne's bright blue lips. Believe me when I tell you that they are the least of the film's problems. No, the real problem becomes evident when Jeremy Irons, one of the best actors working today, walks in and overacts like he is trying to perform in the midst of a violent hypoglycaemic fit. Having had plenty of those, I am speaking from experience when I say that it is a more plausible explanation than any other offered for Irons' performance, save for director Courtney Solomon actually asking him to act this way. But it gets even worse from there. About seven minutes into the film, we get our first earful of Marlon Wayans as Snails, a Human Thief who sounds like he has been too enthusiastic with the anal probe and the helium. By the time he utters his tenth squeal, you will literally be wondering how a canon with creatures colloquially known as landsharks by the residents can suffer this kind of fool.About the only redeeming scene in the entire film comes when the aforementioned Payne throws Wayans off a high platform and thus kills Snails stone dead. This has given rise to a convention in all role-playing games where, at the death of a character one is meant to give a rat's bottom about but does not, one yells out Snails! in their highest, whiniest voice. It is for a good reason. There has never been a character in a film we have wanted to see die so badly. Even Jar Jar Binks had a redeeming moment when he helped give birth to the Empire. Unfortunately, Zoe McLellan and Justin Whalin soon follow this up with a political debate that looks more like a pair of whining children arguing about who is more entitled to the last chocolate bar. Unfortunately, this is not exactly a unique moment in the film, with Thora Birch presenting the heroic side of an argument about whether an absolute monarchy should be set aside in favour of democratic rule in a manner that really leaves her opposition without need to say a thing.There are a few reasons why I prefer this mess of a film to The Lord Of The Rings. Primary among them is that where I can draw unintentional comedy value from Dungeons & Dragons, Return Of The King so seriously believes it is high art that even its failure to notice that it reads like the result of only reading every tenth page of the novel is excruciating. I laughed at D&D. By the time LOTR finally rolled out its credits for the last time, I was crying. But comparisons to one of the worst film adaptations of a novel in history cannot save D&D from the fact that it is a stunning example that one should be careful what they wish for. For years, vocal fans of the game made it clear they wanted a film made by someone who was a fan of the game, as opposed to the suits, the accountants who really run Hollywood. Well, they got what they wanted, with director Courtney Solomon being a fan so determined to make the film according to the idea of D&D that he had in his head that even his own lack of ability as a director could not stop him.And that, in a nutshell, is what killed Dungeons & Dragons at the box office. It is one thing to take a film so seriously that no fun can be discerned from the story when it is needed. It is another entirely to treat the thing as a complete joke. Because nobody in the story is taking their part seriously, the entire deal fails to connect with the viewer on any level, which is a fatal error where fantasy stories are concerned. The traditional market for these kinds of stories has been dominated by intellects, or the kind of people who would be reading Heinlein if they were not reading these stories, so treating the genre in such a cheap fashion is not the way to engage your audience. Especially not when the material you are making a mess of has so much potential. A power struggle between the mages and everyone else in the realm is not an easy story idea to waste so utterly. One reviewer once wrote that making a film or game this bad out of nothing is an everyday event, but making a film or game so bad out of source material like this takes a special effort.Hence, Dungeons & Dragons gets a one out of ten from me. It is so bad one can watch it just to see how terrible films really get.

I really do. I saw it during its theatrical run and laughed so hard that I literally started crying at one point; so when it ended up on DVD, I had to own it. During the year-and-a-half that it has been in my DVD library, I've discovered an interesting fact I...can't...stop...watching it.Now, why do I enjoy this movie so much and publically p*** all over the far superior Star Wars prequels? Well, for one thing, I don't have any emotional stock in D&D. It's a terrible movie with two-dimensional characters, bad writing, horrible direction, and so many cliches that if you tried making it into a drinking game you'd surely die of alcohol poisoning. It's never more than it appears to be a potato chip movie. Sure, it'll rot the brain--but only if you take it seriously (which, I'm afraid, the creative forces behind it did, much to their undoing).Star Wars, however, DOES mean something to me...So when I see one of THOSE films and find it's riddled with two-dimensional characters, bad writing, horrible direction and a multitude of cliches, I have to wonder whether or not we even need Spaceballs anymore. Anyway, I expect more of Mr. Lucas...but NOT of Courtney Solomon.Solomon and his screenwriters sought to create a trilogy here to cash in on the Star Wars phenomenon, and because the anticipation for the first installment of LOTR was growing, a fantasy setting seemed an obvious choice. However, the allusions to LOTR are slight (probably because it had yet to roll off the block); but it's a near-perfect copy of Episode I with a few OT moments thrown in. Obviously, after the success of Phantom Menace, it seemed an easy tomb to rob. The only thing that surprises me is how few critics (or fanboys) have mentioned it.**************************************************1)THE OPENING TEXT CRAWLAnytime a fantasy/sci-fi movie opens with either a text or voice reading that sets the stage, we're reminded of Star Wars, which did it perfectly and without the pretentiousness that its imitators embraced. In D&D, Bruce Payne supplies the narrative. It's Star Wars in every way, right down to the way the last sentence trails off (But the evil mage Profion has other plans....).2)THE YOUNG QUEENNow, I don't understand why I was the only one with a problem with the concept of Queen Amidala. First of all, in a monarchy, you don't ELECT a queen; and secondly, if you do, you vote for the candidate who ISNT thirteen years old. Seriously, how do you LOSE an election like that...?D&D aped this completely. She's young. She's idealistic. She's wooden. She wears god-awful dresses and gaudy head-pieces. Hell, if you want to get REALLY nit-picky about it, you could say that Solomon cast Thora Birch because of the strategically-placed moles on her face that suggest Amidala's red dot thing.3)THE OLDER, TRUSTED ADVISOR WHO'S GONE BADInstead of Palpatine, we're treated to Profion, the worst role Jeremy Irons ever took (and his equally worst performance). Behind the scenes, Profion is plotting to overthrow the queen (referred to as the empress so as not to seem too blatant a rip-off), and is sowing seeds of discord within the council (senate) in order to overthrow her rule. His dirty work, however, is saved for his chief lieutenant...4)THE DARK WARRIORBruce Payne's character, Damodar, is equal parts Darth Vader and Darth Maul. He's a towering, sadistic, black-clad, slow-moving and unbelievably strong armour-clad warrior (Vader) who also happens to be bald-headed and painted with stupid-ass make-up (Maul, who didn't look stupid-ass at all). If this wasn't enough, listen for the thinly disguised echo of The Imperial March when he first appears at the magic school.5)LUKE/HANIn Ridley, we have a combination of the Luke and Han characters. He's a scoundrel who cares nothing for the greater good, but in the end, is willing to turn aside from his love of money (he rejects a pile of easily obtainable gold) in favour of saving the kingdom from the evil Profion. Also we learn that he has latent magical abilities, stemming from his father (this was to be expanded upon in the sequels, when Damodar tells Ridley, No--I am your father!).6)JAR-JAR REDUXMarlon Wayans. Good God, could the allusion be any more transparent. Let's see he's a tall, gangly African-American stereotype spouting catch-phrases, bungling his way in and out of trouble, and generally getting on our *beep* nerves with his not-so-fun humour. Hell, he even has a hat that resembles a pair of goofy, Gungan-like ears. The only satisfaction is that he dies painfully.7)THE SCOUNDREL AND THE GOOD GIRLLike Leia and Han before them, Ridley and Marina come from two different worlds he's an opportunistic creep and she's a member of the aristocrisy. At first they bitch at each other to work out the sexual tension; but in the end, fall in love, much to our great surprise.8)THE MIND RAPERemember when Vader interrogated Leia, using the mind probe to extract the necessary information? In this movie, he uses a pair of penises that live in his ears.9)LET'S SAVE THE GIRL FROM THE IMPENETRABLE FORTRESS!Hey--it's the only way to steal back the much-sought-after plans, right? And while we're there, let's have a main character die, allowing for our hero to scream NOOOOO! (while Milking A Giant Cow, no less).10)CITIES IN TREESAt least the elf cities in LOTR looked elegant. The one here looks shockingly similar to the Ewok village.11)THE SWORDFIGHTWhen Ridley and Damodar have their duel, the clash of their blades creates a lightning effect, rendering the bad guy's sabre red and the good guy's sabre blue. Damodar is finally defeated after Ridley does a leap, sucker-slashes his foe in the midsection, who then falls over a steep drop. It all seemed vaguely familiar...12)RESISTING THE DARK SIDERidley is momentarily seduced by dark magic during the climax; but only by turning aside and embracing the light can he persevere. No! I won't become...YOU!13)BORING POLITICS AND BAD CGI.Come on you know it's true.14)SPLIT-SECOND ESCAPE CHOICESWhen reaching a dead-end while pursued by baddies, our heroes take the smelliest possible escape route through the sewers. To reach this destination, they must dive head-first down a chute where they land in a pool of cr@p (not unlike the Death Star trash compactor, or all of Attack of the Clones).15)OTHER BLATANT RIP-OFFSNeed I mention how Ridley keeps grinning and saying, Trust me? Or how he goes through the Thieves' Maze, a series of riddles straight out of all three Indiana Jones movies? Or about the scene where Marina, belly-down on the floor, is grasping for the scroll, which during the fight, is getting kicked around like a certain diamond in The Temple of Doom? Or how Ridley is stabbed in the shoulder and can be healed only by the King of the Elves? Or that scene where.....You get the point. Watch this movie. Watch it RIGHT NOW. It might be a hodgepodge of rehashed ideas, but it's ten times more entertaining than these new Star Wars movies.By the way a sequel has been officially greenlit.

One of the signs of doom was Shawn Wayans, 'Why Dear God Why' was he in this film, was it a vain attempt to diversify the cast a little, they could have done better, they could have also done worse, if Chris Tucker was in this film my rating would have gone down to a one.

If just for comic relief they had one 10'x10' room with some orcs and a chest I would have at least had a good laugh. The sequel was much better in that respect.Thora Birch's delivery is absolutely awful, she must have just phoned this one in, because she is otherwise a fine actress if she has a good director.

This is also the case with 'Dungeons And Dragons', a movie based on the famous RPG.A couple of months ago I might have gone as far as claimed, that DnD was the worst movie I've ever had pleasure to witness, but that was before I had introduced myself to the movies made by Dr. Boll. That is the level DnD manages to stay out of, yet I am not claiming this to be a good movie, quite the opposite really. It just is as bad, that it is actually quite hilarious. In every aspect, expect when it tries to be funny.The badness of the film ranges from the notable actors to the feeble script. Jeremy Irons, one of the greatest actors of our time, is hamming up the role of eeevil mage Profion just from the heck of it. His overacting is so dramatic that it is drop dead funny. Funniest character of the film is Mr. Blue Lips (Bruce Payne ), vastly overacting henchman of Profit, er, Profion.The plot is quite simple the empress Savina (Thora Birch) is like the guide book to American Democracy, trying to give equal right to commoners and mages. Profion is of course the baddie, who wants the power. So Jimmy Olsen, sorry, Ridley (Justin Whalin, who hasn't changed since 'Lois & Clark The New Adventures of Superman') and totally unfunny lines throwing Snails (Marlon Wayans), who is just a bit above Jar Jar Binks, need to get Eye of The Dragon in order to get Staff Of The Dragon, that can control dragons. Oh and they have this dwarf sidekick, who has the most laughable false beard of the movie history.The writing is simply put amateurish from the pro democracy speeches of the empress (isn't that a bit of an oxymoron really), to the badly done death scenes and hilariously bad lines thrown by Irons.CGI effect scenes would be good, if they would be sticked on a computer game, though lately more than few games have shown better graphics than DnD does.To put this all in perspective, DnD is not the worst film I've seen, it's just a bad movie.

It seems to me that the action was supposed to be the main draw. I can only assume the writer forgot that there are people who actually like to see a film with BOTH action and story when they see a film. In addition, the cause of fighting the villain is so stupid; who cares.The second problem I see was the casting of all the main players in this film. Combine an unestablished actor with little film experience and zero talent with a very talented veteran such as Jeremy Irons and you have a disastrous film called Dungeons & Dragons. Dungeons & Dragons should have stayed locked in a dungeon in a far off place so nobody has to go the suffering I did when I saw this film. Avoid these dungeons at all costs, but should you not heed my warning I feel sorry for you.

His imagination is most of the time limited, he has to tap the classics to fuel the plot (Star Wars or Indiana Jones spring to mind immediately )), his descriptions are somewhat sketchy, he can barely enact a couple of characters in his scenario except by reducing them to caricatures of their alignment and so on.Well that was just the feeling this movie delivered.No plot to speak of, but half a dozen very D&Desques scenes. Take the inn brawl for instance. Here you get all the clich√©s of the genre, including the henchmen walking in line like a bunch of cardboard stormtroopers whit a corncob stuck where the sun does not shine, the amusing dilemma I'm sure every single RPG gamer had to face one day (will you save your friend or your girl?), and the non player characters waiting obligingly for the heroes to pull their act together. Not a trace of realism, and why bother with consistency ? It is during action scenes that the players have fun. Just pure D&D feeling ) No characters to speak of either, but a handful of surprisingly funny caricatures  the lawful evil warrior and his obsessive and pointless sadism, the chaotic evil sorcerer and his megalomaniac rantings, the extremely dense dwarf chucking lumps of meat in the general direction of his mouth while quaffing cheap ale, and so on.As for the sets, costumes and SFX, here again they go right to the point  it HAS to be flashy, brand new looking, and completely over the top. I mean, your average D&D game tells the story of true heroes in a dream world, not the twists and turns of the career of a sales accountant in a shabby suburb ).Well, to sum it up this is an extremely cheesy movie, somewhere between B and Z depending on your fondness for tongue-in-cheek caricatures, but nevertheless I had quite a lot of fun watching it. Not sure the way I enjoyed it was what the director had in mind, though.

The only people you could realistically expect to want to see this movie are fanboys. That the problem. Fanboys come in with huge expectations about what their favorite RPG should look like on the big screen. As movies go D&D was average at best, as a movie based on a game it was horrible. The non-human characters looked like they were costumed by the Salvation Army, and the acting of many was deserving of a Golden Turkey. The only reason I even watched this film was to see if it was really as bad as my friends thought it was, and because I acted with Zoe in a touring company her senior year. Side note-For anyone that cares it looks like Zoe has a bit role in Mona Lisa Smile with Julia Roberts.

As an avid D&D player and fan, I took great offence. I thought it was the typical case of highbrow, arty-farty movie reviewers who hate everything that isn't a foreign art film not being able to appreciate a fantasy movie. And then I saw it. Every poor review had been correct - in fact, they had been downright generous. This film was destined to be an underground cult movie for D&D fans, but instead of writing it as such, it was written to have a broader appeal. It fails on all counts. The storyline was pathetic (an episode of Hercules or Xena would have more twists and nuances), all of the characters are just plain awful - with no personality or depth whatsoever, and even the special effects are terrible. The performance of Justin Whalin as Ridley Freeborn is especially painful. Even Thora Birch (whom I adore) delivers a poor performance; but then again, she isn't given much to work with. On a more geeky level, this movie didn't even resemble D&D (the role-playing game), it was just a generic fantasy film. Nothing which makes the game unique was faithfully represented in this movie. The scenes at the tavern and the thieves guild looked more like the Cantina scene from Star Wars than a glimpse into the established fantasy realms of D&D. If it didn't bear the name Dungeons & Dragons, and was released back in the same era that spawned such campy classics as Beastmaster, Sword and the Sorceror, and Hawk the Slayer, then I might have enjoyed it as a bit of harmless fluff. But to be the end result of the long awaited movie adaptation of the role-playing game, it failed miserably. The team that inflicted this monstrosity upon us should look to movies like Willow, Dragonslayer and Lord of the Rings, and then hang their heads in shame. I can't recommend this film on any level, except possibly as a kids movie, and even then I could think of about 100 better movies to recommend for children.

So I figured maybe it would be better if I didn't expect much. It turns out that Dungeons was worse than I had originally anticipated. I can't believe that any film studio would pay money to have this piece of crap made, even if it's a $35 million budget.I'll start out with the mentally retarded characters We have the two hero characters, Ridley Freeborn (Justin Whalin) and his sidekick Snails (Marlon Wayans), the villain Profion (Jeremy Irons) and his aide, Damodar (Bruce Payne), whose attire seems little more than a Halloween costume bought at Kmart (I'd bet this was Kmart's last sale), and simple makeup consisting of blue lipstick that has virtually no difference to the stuff kids wear at school these days -- some of the characters' costumes resemble trench coats, as well. In addition, we have Thora Birch as the Empress, who is a complete cliche of Star Wars's Queen Amidala. There's also a slothy dwarf, whose fake beard looks almost as cheap as boxer shorts from the Goodwill. And I feel sorry for the people who actually think these actors are actually any good.Another thing wrong with the picture is the watery script and cheap direction. Is it too much to ask to deliver a decent script, even when you're on a $35 million budget? I got bored early on in the film. Nothing is exciting about the film, and watching Justin Whalin and Marlon Wayans act is enough for me to throw up my popcorn. The casting was overall poor, as they simply hired a little (or a lot) too many unexperienced actors. And it's a shame to see a talented actor such as Jeremy Irons be wasted. It's also a shame to see characters make references to a modern or earthlike culture, which is why the script is so horrid.Lastly, and unfortunately, what really kills the film, is the overuse of crappy CG effects, even on a tight budget. I can't understand why the filmmakers couldn't go a little overbudget -- like some of the most successful films have -- and better tweak the obvious computer-generated dragons at an experienced visual effects house, such as Industrial Light & Magic, Sony Imageworks, or Digital Domain. It would have greatly improved the storytelling, though not the story itself, and we wouldn't get distracted from the overall experience. To me, good fx are why people go to see a movie. I know this because almost all of the top highest grossing films of all time relied heavily on fx. So what if the storytelling is ill and the characters are bland?

I'll give you a second to let that sink in. This movie could not have been worse except that I saw the DVD. There's a little documentary with an interview of the director who was discussing costume designs. That's it.  This guy is so full of himself that he thinks he can take an absolutely wonderful game that I have played and put it in a blender. Apparently Courtney also believed that emotions could be expressed through many gestures like waving hands around a lot. Unfortunately, that only works in third grade plays. I know. I was in one.Anyway, Jeremy Irons doesn't even talk in this. He just screams incoherently and points at people. Heck, I do that for free!  Thora Birch looks like she's always reading a cue card and why is Jimmy Olsen the hero?  The one bright spot to this film is Marlon, The main character's sidekick. Obviously, he didn't listen to the director and actually acted. Go figure. No spoilers here, but he's only in the film halfway through. Now whatever movie there was before, there's nothing after him.The special effects are typical less-than-Star Wars-budget type. But I did like the dogfight between two of the dragons, so I won't totally destroy this movie.  All in all it was a very BAD movie, but if you don't want to watch paint dry, then this is a good distraction.

From the first moment on, the pain of watching this movie was unbearable ridiculous costumes, wooden acting, amateurishly grotesque make-up, nonsensical screenwriting, ferocious editing all combined to make this an event not soon to be forgotten--like a train wreck, so terrible that no one can bear to look away from it. One might almost have prophesised of its doomed premiere--it will be a day long remembered if, that is, this movie didn't rip off Star Wars more frequently and more thoroughly than we could ever hope to.The actors ranged from amateurishly mediocre to outright appalling Thora Birch's acting, if it can be called that, was so lacking in spirit, imagination, and vitality that when Jeremy Irons' character said sarcastically of hers, she gives a good performance we could only agree. Irons himself is no better, of course, because he seems to think that if Birch is barely acting at all, he must do the acting for them both. So he delivers the climactic monologue of the movie in a trance-like state that looks very much like drug-induced epilepsy, a frightening moment, to be sure.The poor writing played its part too. The character of the dwarf is not only not fleshed out, he is unnamed and, for the most part, uninvolved in the dialogue. He speaks perhaps four or five lines in the movie, yet he is supposed to be a major character. What lines he does speak are molded entirely by the stereotype of what a dwarf should be Most dwarves don't like horses; I don't either or Most dwarves don't show their emotions, but I do. His motivation is painfully unclear when, lying in a pile of garbage, the other characters trip over him. He, apparently without reason, gets up and follows them into the sewers. A few scenes later (during which he has said nothing) the characters ask if he is going with them on their quest. He responds sagely, What choice do I have? We wonder the same thing.The budget must have been stretched a little too thin, as some of the pivotal scenes of the movie--the one where two of the characters encounter a wraith and he gives them their quest--are omitted from the movie and recounted later (Instead of the wraith, one is treated to a rather extended scene where the dwarf consumes greasy chicken, getting about as much of it in his beard as in his mouth). The same holds for the fabled Maze of (insert obviously made-up name here), which is comprised of a linear series of three rooms. It is neither a maze, nor particularly worthy of its fable, as the thief is able to frustrate its traps with barely any effort at all.In all, the movie was unbearable to watch and, though at the end of a bad review, one often feels compelled to note the one or two good elements--the token elements to make the review seem even-handed--this review can offer no such optimistic outlook. Make no mistake about it if you see this movie, hoping to be impressed, overjoyed, enraptured, enlightened, illumined, or even just simply pleased, you will be sadly deflated. You will only find such things if you were looking to watch a bad movie--in which case this is a profoundly impressive work!

Along side a 'low level' mage and a dwarf they found in a pile of feces. Later an elf ranger comes into play as well. This movie has some nice CGI effects and costumes. It has a nice setting and atmosphere most of the time. Also there are a few scenes that are acted out well. (2 or 3) But the greatest part of this movie is when Snails played by Marlyne Waynes dies. Now this gives something away but with a story this god forsakenly bad I don't think anyone would mind. The acting is bad, the story is bad, the characters are bad, the props, and other small details suck. Jeremy Irons, an Oscar winner, is probably the best actor but to me his character changed too many times. My theory is that the script for the movie was so bad it didn't let the actors understand how to play their characters. The princess is so bad I couldn't resist laughing.They also didn't follow D&D's rules too much. They said that mages were looked up to while everyone else was a commoner. And they insisted on using the word mage not magic user or magician or wizard. Ridley the thief possesses some special ability but it is never known what it is; there are some really bad attempts at foreshadowing it. The elf ranger has only a few lines yet one of the reasons I came to see that movie was to see her. (She is very nice looking) The young wizard that comes with the thieves doesn't even cast any spells until she gets her hangs on some magical Tinkerbarry dust. This movie is so bad it made the group I was with laugh. The ending is so damn pathetic. Originally I would rate this movie ¬Ω higher until I saw what happened at the end.

His nearby allies are here mostly to motivate him and provide (bad) comic relief (Wayan guy / C3PO, R2D2). Princess working for a better world (emperess / princess lea) is in danger from a dark ruler (Jeremy Irons / Emperor). The dark ruler uses a monster to enforce his domination (blue lips dude / Darth Vador).

That blue lips bad guy (how cheesier can make-up be?) is a bland cliche and tiring, generic interpretation of a villain.

Why only he could pass through the force field? What exactly is happening with the crew at the end when visiting snails tomb? and why? In that dialogue between the young female mage and the blue lips bad guy, why did he go from menacing to pathetic to menacing again? These questions pop constantly every 5 minutes.I pity the D&D fans because this film is a complete disrespect to them and ridicules the D&D universe. From my young teen years memories, I cant relate most magic spells/monsters/class psychology from the game I played. This should have been an easy hit, with precise rules, a universe already finely built, and a huge fan pool. It is instead a bad comedy, which isnt the nature of the D&D universe.To see movies that really respect the fans of the super heroes/fantasy genre and express the real essence of those universes, watch Batman 1-2, X-men, Highlander 1, The Matrix, Star wars, Unbreakable, Conan. This movie, like so many others, seems to be made by old people who dont give a %$#@#@ about it and are looking for a quick buck because of the pre-existing fan pool.Even if you're just looking for eye candy and have low expectations, like I was, you will STILL be terribly disappointed.

I was extremely disappointed in it and expected a lot more after watching the very promising trailer for it in the cinema.I rented it the other night and, I must admit, was looking forward to actually watching it. I am normally a huge fan of all fantasy/Sci-fi/action/adventure movies, and I honestly thought that this one would be no exception. I should have taken the hint that it wouldn't be that great of a movie when there were only six copies of the video to rent (all of which were still there) in the whole store, whereas movies like What Women Want, which was released at the same time, had about 20 copies of which only a few were still available. However, this could be because of the fact that What Women Want stars Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt, whereas Dungeons and Dragons stars less well known celebrities (except for Jeremy Irons and possibly Thora Birch).I didn't particularly like some of the supposedly funny lines, and I thought that the dwarf in the movie was a completely unecessary character. I understand the fact that this film is based on the card game, and therefore maybe it was thought that the dwarf was required to complete the game-based characters (though I have no idea if this is the case as I have never played the game, nor know anything about it)I think that if the dwarf was, in fact, thought to be a necessary character, then maybe a more developed part should have been made for him, as it seemed to me that the dwarf was just added to the film for decoration purposes. He only said something like three lines in the entire movie anyway.I will not continue to go on about the various parts of the movie that annoyed me, and I do agree that the movie seemed to revolve around a basis similar to that of Star Wars Episode 1 Phantom Menace, in the respect that a young female ruler is struggling to improve the qualities of her Empire.However, I will say that I liked the set decoration in Dungeons and Dragons, which did display some vivid imagination. Finally, I would like to say that I believe all films contain good in them, no matter what they are. Therefore, I think Dungeons and Dragons would appeal more to people who enjoy the game and to those who like simple humor and sorcery.

Also, the acting is sadly on a par with that of your friends gathered in someone's living room on a Saturday night; the dialogue sounds perfunctorily expository rather than being remotely natural (even on the scale of a Star Wars movie). And what was Jeremy Irons doing in this movie? I bet he fired his agent immediately afterward.The movie might have been far better if the director were experienced and the people involved hadn't been enthusiasts of the game.

Upon leaving that cave, he finds that the villain Damodar has captured his friends. If you can't predict every line that follows in that scene, then you a) haven't seen enough movies, and b) could possibly enjoy this one.I can't really say that I found Dungeons & Dragons disappointing, since I wasn't expecting much from it. I just wasn't expecting it to be so comedically bad. The main problem with it, I think, is as follows When they decided to make this movie, they knew that people who play the game would see it. But they treated those people as idiots when they made it, assuming they had never seen a fantasy movie or TV show before. The writing is just stolen from countless other sources, to the point where almost the entire movie is completely predictable, line for line in places such as the one I mentioned.People who play D&D, such as I do, will be insulted by the way the game is depicted on the screen. For example, a camp of villains uses creatures called beholders as guards. Beholders are one of the most dangerous, evil creatures in the D&D universe. A beholder won't serve as your guard, it will kill you. And it won't be distracted by a thrown rock, it will see who threw the rock, and kill him. And the whole plot point involving the ability to control dragons is ludicrous. To think that such a wonderful game will forever be connected to that image.Let's assume for the moment that you can accept the fact that the writing is horrible, and want to see Dungeons & Dragons simply as eye candy. Even that doesn't work, as the computer effects are absolutely hackish. I swear I've seen better on my Dreamcast. And the hideous acting is very distracting. Who decided to put Marlon Wayans in this movie?! Not even the wonderful Jeremy Irons can save it, despite the energy he puts into his role. He ends up just looking dumb.The only way that Dungeons & Dragons is at all enjoyable is as one of those awful movies you rent to make fun of. It works beautifully that way. But considering the fact that it was made mainly as a commercial for the just-released-at-the-time 3rd Edition of the game, and that no one would want to relive this trash, it fails miserably. It fails even more miserably if you already play the game, and expect to see an accurate and interesting representation of the adventures you've played through. If your D&D game has been anything like this movie, find yourself a new DM.

Whether you love fantasy, or believe it to be the realm of spotty-faced young men with no social life, the franchise itself is so huge (and has such an enormous fan base) and has such scope for development that the film-makers should've been frothing at the mouth with excitement. Unfortunately, the end result appears to be frothing at the mouth with no more then rabies. Firstly, it looks terrible. Half the battle with a fantasy film is convincing your audience that such a world could exist, and using cheap CGI effects are not the way to do this. Not only that, the 'Dragon Mace of Wobbly Destructiveness' (or something) worryingly resembled a plastic 'He-Man' toy. Hmmmm. The acting gets no better.

What followed was a pitiful attempt to merge JRR Tolkien and Star Wars. The D&D concept has tons and tons of potential, but Courtney Solomon has turned out a compromise between the mature viewer and the mindless hordes of entertainment-deprived children.The movie starts off shakily, drags at parts and has a plot that falls apart at several places. The entire setting is reminiscent of Star Wars Episode I, complete with the council member with dark intentions, the fledgling young princess, the kingdom in danger and the speeches in front of a council. Thora Birch's acting is strained and naive, surpassed in ridiculousness only (and very surprisingly) by Jeremy Irons' performance. Overacting is too gentle a word. His comic-book growls and spell-casting seem to be aimed solely at the 7-year-old audience.Although the movie has all the components of a good fantasy film (namely, orcs, elves, mages, dragons), some basic rules seem to be circumvented to our hero's convenience. How is that Ridley (our hero, a *thief*) possesses a hand-to-hand fighting prowess enough to overcome every single burly guard he meets, and indeed, even the mighty Damodar in a sword battle in the ridiculous conclusion? Why does Damodar leave the map and the ring of black magic so unguarded that a mere boy thief and an apprentice mage can escape with it? The council scene is perhaps the most ridiculous, as Profion and the young queen take the floor to SCREAM at each other and attempt to make powerful statements - a truly pitiful attempt, especially by Jeremy Irons.Most incidents in the course of the movie seem to have no bearing on the conclusion, all of which lead to some terribly boring parts. The Star Wars resemblence is unmistakable in the end, when Ridley sword-fights with the apprentice of the dark overlord (the overlord here being Profion, and Damodar his apprentice, as opposed to the Emperor and Darth Vader in Star Wars) as the forces of good and evil clash around them.On the whole, a good entertainer for the kids. If you expect a plot from a movie, or even a movie that holds together, maybe you should watch something more credible, like The Mummy Returns. If you're a Star Wars fan, go see this one and spot the similarities. And if you're a thinking sci-fi/fantasy fan like me, spare yourself the pain...

Only one character sticks with me at all, the tracker Elf Norda, who is quite beautiful and acted her part well.If this movie was intended to draw new gamers into the D&D world, then I hope that those watching understand that it is not a fair representation. Not at all! I won't even mention the special effects, the acting, or the plot. Not worth the time.

So with nostalgic thoughts and cautious hopes I went to see the long-awaited Dungeons and Dragons movie.  From the opening moments of the movie I knew I was in for a horrific experience.For starters, the movie 'borrows' (okay... out-right steals) heavily from 'Star Wars'.  It was as if I were watching a high school rewrite of Episode 1 in rustic wear.Secondly, The bad guys are over the top Bruce Payne plays a villian that inexplicably wears blue lipstick and talks in a hissing-low pitched 'bad guy' voice; Jeremey Irons' character (the main 'bad guy') is almost like snidley whiplash without a moustache-- I almost expected the thieves in this movie to wear black striped clothes and carry bags with dollar signs on them.Third, even though Courtney Solomon (the director) supposedly was a D&D player, it seems NO ONE in this movie has any concept of what Dwarves and Elves are or how they are supposed to act.Finally... there are absolutely NO characters in this film that you care about.  The dialogue was horrendous, and the story was predictable, implausible, and almost incoherent.Overall I would have to say that this movie set back any hopes of the 'Sword and Sorcerey' genre ever getting any respect.

The first, and most important, was as a movie in its own right. In this category it was bad enough. The characters were poorly crafted with little or no depth.The plot was even thinner than the character definitions and relied on us believing that a large group of intelligent and educated people (ie the Mage's council) would be so gullible as to simply take the main bad guy at his word without any supporting evidence. And it goes down hill from that point. And as for the music building tension in a cave just as the hero discovers.....a tree. I actually laughed out loud at that point.The special effects weren't bad but the costuming was terrible. The axe that the dwarf uses is the low point of the costumes and looks like its made out of styrofoam. There are a lot more examples of poor costuming, but I won't go into those.The second category is as movie based on the game Dungeons and Dragons. Now I'm not a fan of the game, but I do know that they barely even paid lip service to the rules of the game.The third category is as a movie based on role playing games in general. Its a more broad based category. One of the key elements of role playing is the social, where the characters work as a team to achieve their goals. In the movie, this never actually happened. Every time there was a challenge it was always the same character facing it on his own.All in all, a very poor movie.

Beware.","Date":"26 February 2001","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":"  In my humble opinion, Dungeons and Dragons is undeniably one of the worst films of its genre. The combination of an extremely shoddy plot, wince worthy acting and staid set pieces combine to reduce it to a hollow shell of the film it could have been. Considering some of the fairly weighty creative talent behind some of the Wizards of the Coast products, it is puzzling to me how they managed to botch this movie so badly. I will attempt to summarise my major bones of contention below.Acting Jeremy Irons, as Profion, overacts with such enthusiasm it is a wonder he didn't rupture something vital. His irate, fist waving, finger pointing mockery of an evil archmage is a sterling endorsement for switching to decaffeinated coffee. I can only assume he's that angry because his agent thought this film would be a good career move.The so called 'heroes' fair little better. Ridly and Snails, played respectively, if not respectably, by Justin Whalin and Marlon Wheyans, horse around like a second rate Mel Gibson and Danny Glover from the Lethal Weapon film, using all manner of 20th century colloquialisms and slang, making them seem completely out of touch with the medieval setting. The dwarf says little, and does nothing. He joins the party with no explanation and for no discernible reason. The female mage whines incessantly and wears gradually more revealing outfits to please the 14 year old male gender demographic, the elven ranger scowls in her unlikely, and frankly perverse armour and it's all a hideous mess. The teenage Empress, shameless based on a character (Queen Amidala) ripped off from Star wars episode one, whines on about equality between commoner and mage until you actually *want* Profion to kill her. But he's too inept.The story is so full of holes it resembles a celluloid swiss cheese. Two major bloopersProfion steals the royal rod of gold dragon control, only to seemingly give it back later on. Why? Granted, it doesn't work for him, but it would have caused big problems for the good guys if he had he kept it. Or perhaps not. See next point.The Empress, attempting to get rid of Profion, summons the gold dragons to ATTACK HER OWN CITY. The heroes must be psychic, because they are questing for the rod of red dragon control for seemingly no real reason, then realise they can use it against the gold dragons...resulting in more collateral damage to the city. Oops. Bet your subjects love you, Empress Savina.In several scenes, this film rips off all three Indiana Jones movies, Star Wars 1,4,5 and 6, but has little of their style or panache. A lack of effort and originality combines into the worst two hours I have spent in a cinema. I can only hope there are no plans for a sequel.A small point. At no point during the opening credits do you see a Wizards of the Coast logo. Maybe they didn't like it either.

While some aspects of the film  were entertaining, such as Jeremy Irons' gutbusting performance  as the evil mage Profion, the film falls flat on its face primarily because of its unfortunate affiliation with the popular role-playing game (RPG) of the same name.There is little in this film that is in common with the game.  The adventure's mage/love interest, Marina (Zoe McLellan), who rightly should be the most powerful character in the party, is truncated down to the damsel-in-distress cliche that this genre just begs for. Furthermore, the film is not set in any of the game's worlds, which limits not only other plots (The Dragonlance series?  the Icewind Dale series, anybody?) but also severs any potential for in-jokes which would cater to the die-hard gamers that this film is obviously  trying to sell itself to.  Non-D&D types will be turned off because they'll expect two hours of nerd-talk (and rightfully so, I confess), and the rest of Humanity will walk past Dungeons and Dragons (and hopefully into Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon)when they see the often horrid visual effects that the picture boasts.  The IMDB says that this film cost $35 million to produce.  By looking at the CGI dragons, you'd think that was 35 million yen.Furthermore, the acting in Dungeons and Dragons is easily the worst out of any film this year.  Thora Birch, after giving an excellent performance in last year's American Beauty, shrivels in this picture down into a wad of pseudo-Rousseau philosophy that wouldn't be out of place in a junior-high beauty parade.  What is most suprising, however, is that the over-the-top performance of Profion by Jeremy Irons is probably the best of the lot; he does what he can with such lines as LET THE BLOOOOOOD RAIN FROM THE SKYYYYYY!!!!! and the results are truely awe-inspiring.(spoilers ahead)Screenwriters Topper Lilien and Carroll Cartwright apparently had no idea which characters would click with the audience.  After seeing the film, my friends and I agreed that that our faviourite characters were the ones that died  Profion, and the protagonist's sidekick, Snails.  Not the best way to connect emotionally with your viewers, no?(end spoilers)All of this puts Dungeons and Dragons in an awkward position.  It's not bad enough to completely write off as there are several aspects of it that are worthwhile seeing, but those are all offset by the horrid acting, atrocious visuals, and non-existent plot.  The result is that Dungeons and Dragons is just beyond the realm of MST3K  It's just good enough that there's not a whole lot to mock about it.-Nathan B.

It's a rousing, spirited romp of an adventure story that never slacks for a second. It's really hard to pin down in terms of what other fantasy movies it best fits with. I think the world is much better realized than most any other fantasy film. It has the derring-do of Willow..combat is fast paced and often brutal, even though there's no blood thrown around, people do get stabbed, slashed, and brought down hard. My only complaint on the fight scenes is similar to X-Men, what we get is great, but they don't last long enough..and with the exception of a very satisfying climatic battle they all ended too quickly for my tastes.

Remember that this came out after Hercules The Legendary Adventures and before The Lord of the Ring Trilogy. And It really is between them. While it is not intentionally campy it contain many of the fantasy genre jokes that come up when people play the game. At the same time it tries to be as serious as possible considering the budget it had to work with. Visual the movie really delivered (that is as for the expectations of the day). It is no, Lord of the Rings. It is not intended to be that kind of story. No one is dragged off to destroy the soul bearing ring of the second in command of Morgoth to save the world from hell on earth, but like most D&D games the fate of one kingdom will hang in the balance. The acting is better than Charmed, but less than an A+ (charmed fans, please don't kill me, I like the show boy, I miss Cole (I'm not gay, he was just really cool thank goodness for reruns)). The movie is full of inside jokes and references, so it's only an okay movie if you have never played the game, if you got a slow day, it would be a fine a catch on Sci-fi, WAM, or the like. If you have played the game (and the more games the better) you will find yourself repeated saying hehe, I love dwarfs, is that a drow?, dang, I did that same thing, every newbie does that first time out, Haha that is Rule Zero for you, or at least he didn't do what I did, this one time... with jovial cries.The Title holds true the spirit of the D&D game world. But much like the Hulk, outsider and persnickety viewers throw their fits. I am a Gamer I know a number of the inside jokes, but frell every time I go back I get something new. To sum up, it is not the greatest or worst movie of time. But if you have a penchant for fantasy but aren't a captious viewer, or if you are dating a gamer then it's not a bad jaunt to take, and it's one I would recommend.

He is very powerful, but not yet that powerful. Only the empress can control dragons with the aid of her scepter. But Profion coerces the high council to request her to give her scepter up. An old adviser informs the emperor that there is an old scroll, speaking of yet another scepter that controls dragons, if she could get her hands on that, she could give up her original scepter, pleasing the council and continuing her quest for equal rights in her empire. Profion hears of this and sends his right hand man, Damodar, captain of the guard, to dispose of the adviser. So he does, but two thieves and a novice mage, aid to the adviser, stumbles upon the murder and runs off with the old scroll. Framed for the murder they are now hunted both by Damodar and the empress, and stumbles into an adventure.Comments This is in no way a top movie. But, it got the heart in the right place, doesn't try to pretend it is something more that it is not and manages well with the resources it has. If you like the genre, and are in the mood for it, this is a very nice light-hearted adventure with some elements of action and adventure. The special effects are crucial for this movie, and although they are sufficient, they are not as beautiful as movies with bigger budgets, and unfortunately it shows. But I must say, do not think the effects are poor or ugly, it is just that I have seen better. Neither the story nor the acting will win any awards, but they are not bad either. Maybe the best part in the entire production is the casting. Iron, Payne, Whalin and Wayans, yes the entire head cast is perfect for their roles. Still, the casting does not carry the entire movie, but combined with other parts, seemingly average, they together add to become something a little more than its sums.6/10 "},{"Title":"Actually...","Date":"6 January 2006","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":" Actually, I quite enjoyed this.

Those without magical abilities are little more than slaves. However the young Empress Savina (Thora Birch) believes everyone should live in equality & peace which is an idea the evil sorcerer Profion (Jeremy Irons) doesn't like that much so he convinces the Mage council to force Savina to hand over a magic sceptre that controls the gold Dragons, but she refuses. Profion then decides his only hope is to obtain the magic sceptre that controls the more powerful red Dragons so he sends the Crimson Guards lead by Damodar (Bruce Payne) to steal a map which reveals it's location. Meanwhile two common or garden thieves Ridley (Justin Whalin) & Snails (Marlon Wayans) decide to rob a Mage to try & impress everyone but stumble across Damodar trying to steal the map, they mange to stop him & together with a young attractive female apprentice Mage named Marina (Zoe McLellan) they escape with the much sought-after map. It's not long before their faces are plastered everywhere, along with a dwarf named Elwood (Lee Arenberg) they decide to find the sceptre, help Empress Savina achieve her aim of fairness & equality for all & put an end to Profion's evil schemes. But this quest will not be without it's peril's, from the thief Xilus (Richard O'Brien) & his maze of deadly bobby traps to the ever lurking presence of Damodar & his men...Co-produced & directed by Courtney Solomon this American Czech Republic production is a mildly entertaining fantasy film. The first thing I should point out is that I have never played the Dungeons & Dragons board game, I have no idea how it is played & I have no idea about any of it's background story, central characters or settings if indeed there are any. I am commenting on Dungeons & Dragons as a fantasy film fan & not a role-playing board game fan, this is probably why I actually didn't think it was too bad compared to some of the other comments here. The script by Topper Lilien & Carroll Cartwright moves along at a fairly brisk pace & something is always happening. The overall story is a little confused as I'm having trouble remembering the specifics but who needs a story? One problem with Dungeons & Dragons is that the characters are rather clich√©d & poorly developed, the loser hero with boyish good looks who predictably becomes romantically involved with his opposite a privileged attractive woman whom both end up falling in love with each other, the token black character of Snails is the obligatory comic relief & he is there for no other reason that I could see & the non human Dwarf & Elf are present to presumably try & please the fans as they have no purpose in the film whatsoever other than to be there & give the impression that we are in the Dungeons & Dragons universe & the bad guys are pure pantomime with Irons overacting, Payne looking ridiculous as Damodar with his blue lipstick & some creatures popping out of his ears every so often & the usual incompetent henchmen who can't shoot straight or fight properly. I didn't get that ending either with everyone turning into magical bright lights & floating off, I did get a kick out of seeing Jeremy Irons being eaten by a Dragon though & in my humble opinion I thought more people should have been eaten. With a supposed budget of about $35,000,000 technically Dungeons & Dragons varies, some of the CGI effects are excellent like the shots of Izmer as the camera glides under, around, over, through & between the various bridges, towers & buildings. While other effects like some of the Dragons look very fake & obviously computer (or Playstation maybe?) generated. Director Solomon who held onto the rights to make Dungeons & Dragons for 10 years while he found financing manages to create some decent scenes, especially Ridley conquering the maze of traps. The cinematography, editing, sets, music & production design are all of a pretty high standard. The acting is OK I suppose but nothing brilliant, Whalin was obviously cast for the teen audience & McLellan was obviously cast for her looks. Dungeons & Dragons is far from the best film I have ever seen but it is far from the worst & I found it rather entertaining in a silly childish sort of way. I have no idea how this compares to or resembles the board game but as a stand alone piece of fantasy adventure it passed 110 odd minutes painlessly enough & that's all I was really hoping for. Worth a watch if there's absolutely nothing else on but just don't expect too much.

The acting seems like they don't know what they're doing, basically because it seems like they're having to interpret the entire movie from the start.

Thora Birch wasn't all that good, her acting was a little too much of it, if you get my point. She obviously wanted to put a lot of emotion in it, this becomes very clear when she talks with Vildian. The rest of the characters was okay, with Snails being the funny guy a movie like this can't go without.*THIS PART CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!*Something else; does Ridley have mage blood or not? I couldn't figure this one out. We get the intention that his father had something to do with mages, maybe even was one, but why don't we get this explained?

Why do the friends turn into flying balls of light? Where are they flying to anyway? It would have made more sense to me if Snails suddenly showed up behind the group or something.The end actually was a bit funny to me and my brother. After the gold dragon ate Profion, it sort of falls down. We both thought he'd died after eating Profion, because the mage was so poisonous or something! But the animal flew away.

'hey this could actually be okay'.  I was expecting it to go downhill form there, but strangely it didn't. It held my attention with decent characters, a good (and for once original) plot and some great and very memorable scenes (big swinging axes ahoy!!). And it seems that everyone else in the almost full cinema agreed with me. Even the third time I went to see it (a good 5-6 weeks after it was released over here (in England)) the cinema was still almost full. And when the film had finished I heard many people (young and old) commenting on how much they enjoyed it... Indeed I haven't actually MET a person I know who has seen it who DOESN'T like it. (then again I've only talked to about 6)I've read many reviews of D&D that describe Jeremy Irons' acting as 'hammy' and, ok, I have to admit I almost cringed after his first couple of lines. But he plays Profion (the bad guy) brilliantly, and you soon get to realise what the character was intended to be like.... i.e. a complete mad man, a loon! It just goes to show that we Brits really can produce high grade bad guys! I also must complement Bruce Payne for playing Damodar so well, I don't know about anyone else but I really grew to hate him (not the actor obviously, the character he played) as the film progressed , he really does have a chilling, villainous voice on him. In fact the entire cast played their roles well. I've heard some people giving a bit of stick to Thora Birch who plays Empress Savina. However I think she's plays the character pretty well, certainly better than Princess Amidala in Episode 1 and by the end of the film she gets some real backbone to set things straight.The effects are consistently strong, from the breathtaking opening flyby over the city of Sumdall, to the amazing dragon battle. And the dragons really do look great. I've heard some say that the climactic battle is too short (it's not!!), but even if it was, who cares when it's this good! Also if you want some seriously cool effects check out the sword fight nearer the end. Throughout the film there is enough action to make sure things don't get boring. D&D has it's own unique 'feel' to it that sets it aside from other fantasy films such as Dragonheart, and while it is certainly not a childish film it never takes itself TOO seriously, basically it's spot on in my view.D&D's soundtrack also deserves a special mention. For me it shined through during the entire film. There are a number of themes which crop up, whenever Ridley (the hero) does anything heroic or whenever a fight breaks out the music really succeeds in picking up the pace. Also the villains (Profion and Damodar) have their own menacing, sometimes even frightening themes (anyone who owns the soundtrack, see Damodars Curse).As far as I can see all the criticisms aimed at D&D are unjust, it isn't TRYING to be a masterpiece, it's simply a very good and very entertaining film.....if I haven't got it across particularly well so far, I think it's excellent! There really is no reason not to like D&D. It has something there for everyone. If you have any doubt go and see it. you might be pleasantly surprised!

I play D&D and I found that it followed the rules of the game very well.  I recommend this film to anyone who liked Star Wars or any fan of Sci-Fi/Fantasy.

If you went for a humorous movie, you probably weren't terribly disappointed.  If you went for a completely original plot, you were in for a real disappointment.The acting was fairly solid, but coupled with the rip offs of Return of the Jedi, Raiders of the Lost Ark, ElfQuest, and more, it suffered for lack of original plotline with which to work.My recommendation  Save yourself some money and wait until it's out in the rental stores.

I can't wait to see it again.  The sound was great, the special effects were great, and I can't wait for the sequel--it was left way open for a sequel.  Also, there were some parts that needed to be explained a little better than they were in the movie.  But, other than that, the movie was excellent.

How these two screenwriters could also pen Where the Money Is, which Paul Newman said YES to, is beyond me. These people can't write, they CANNOT write. Any two-bit wanna-be hack who ever penned a scene for a Renaissance Fair could write dialogue at least as good as this, it's a cross between a bad romance novel and the aforementioned Ren-Fair dialogue, as written by two people who have never been to one.Second, the direction wasn't that bad. For a first timer, Courtney Solomon at least made the movie pretty to look at, giving us exciting monsters, locales, make-up, dungeons and, well, dragons. Hopefully he'll get better as he goes on.Third, the acting was MOSTLY decent, with two exceptions Lee Arenberg, playing a 5-foot dwarf, has little acting experience, and it shows. Thora Birch, who was in American Beauty, looks like a deer in headlights through the entire movie. She woke up later, apparently, as the energy in her voice is often completely contradictory to her half-asleep facial expressions.Special awards to Justin Whalin's swordplay and Jeremy Irons's eyebrows for carrying the film.With a better screenplay this could have been a great sword and sorcery adventure, but as it is, you can either hope for a Mystery Science Theater 3000 revival, or just watch it with the sound off. A terrible, terrible film. But in a good way. 7/10.

A fantasy movie that seemed fun at first, but ended up being the most overacted piece of tripe I've seen. While the movie has its high points and the plot had promise, the actors (particularily the evil characters) turned this movie to hash.Profion was the absolute worst, a cartoonish caricature of a villain. He'd have been more believable if he'd been animated with crayons.The dwarf was a disgrace to dwarfs everywhere, a drunken, bumbling sot with no use.The thieves were the best and the most human, and watching them joke around was kinda fun; at least they gave the movie some humanity.But all in all, I agree with Snails. Ridley is another word for stupid, and this is the Ridleyest movie I've ever watched.A must see, if you like Brainburn.

Remember to swirl the bottle to mix up the natural yeast break and round out the flavor.And don't laugh at geeky chicks before drinking at the same social event they are attending- after a few beers you may find them more appealing but they will remember your insult.

Every time the actors try to expand their characters the script shoots the crap out of them the plot looks like some one shot at it with an UZI and the characterization is all over the place also the rating it got was ridicules M15+. Now I have seen more violent movies with an M15+ rating Predator for one but all this movie had was the death of one of its characters and the death of a few dragons nothing more there wasn't any fowl language so why did it get such a high rating maybe the film classifiers wanted the movie to fail by dragging the younger audience away. Now the movie isn't a total loss when I first sore it I hated it after the first 5 minutes the second time I watched it it was more bearable and by the third time I could see the actors trying to work with the bad script and now I think of it as a good but bad movie the bad part being the script the good being that its bearable and a good enough watch on a slow day.

Don't go expecting any great performances or impressive special effects.  There are decent images and scenes, but this is an inexpensive movie that is worth seeing at the matinee or second-run.  It's been a while since a decent fantasy film has been released, and this one is decent.The acting was over-the-top and the plot was redux from many other films, but that did not matter.  You should go into this movie expecting standard fantasy.  Nobody has been claiming this movie is a great dramatical work.  It's fun, entertaining, and sometimes goes out of its way to make fun of itself.The cast has several strong names, but you get the idea they are making fun of themselves and the movie they are in with their performances.  Though Marlon Wayans does turn in a good performance as Snails the bumbling thief. However, most of the cast seems to be just learning to act, which adds to the over-acting.I gave this movie a 6 out of 10 because it was worth my time and in a genre devoid of current movies, it was above average.  Is it as good as Highlander (1986), The Princess Bride (1987), Willow (1988), Excalibur (1981), or Conan the Barbarian (1982)? No, but then it is not as bad as Highlander II The Quickening (1991), Metalstorm The Destruction of Jared-Syn (1983), or Leonard Part (1987) ...some of the worst movies of all time.  To compare to a recent movie, Dungeons and Dragons (2000) was more enjoyable than Red Planet (2000).

I am pleased to say that it rises far above my expectations.  Better than average acting from the less-known portion of the acting ensemble, a couple of surprises, and a much better storyline than what you might expect all raise this feature above past attempts by moviemakers to capture the D&D audience.  Yes, Jeremy Irons overacts quite a bit, but it's all in context. Some of the special effects are weak, most noticeably the dragons themselves, but many of the other effects scenes are breathtaking and beautiful.  Viewers who know nothing of D&D lingo can watch without feeling left out, but long-time roleplayers will appreciate the care with which the filmmakers remained true to the rules of the game.  All in all, an admirable piece of work, given the constraints of a popcorn adventure-comedy-fantasy genre, and well worth a look if you enjoy swords and sorcery.  6.5 out of 10.

Based on the popular role-playing game, this film sees bad guy wizard Profion (Jeremy Irons) wanting to control the red dragons with a powerful artifact, and overthrow young Empress Savina (American Beauty's Thora Birch). The heroes trying to stop it are thieves Ridley Freeborn (Child's Play 3's Justin Whalin) and Snails (Scary Movie's Marlon Wayans), along with apprentice wizard Marina Pretensa (Zoe McLellan), hard-drinking dwarf Elwood Gutworthy (Lee Arenberg) and mysterious dark elf ranger Norda (Kristen Wilson), who was originally trying to stop them. They are pursued by Damodar (Bruce Payne) as they get closer to recovering the magic gemstone from the maze of Xilus (The Rocky Horror Picture Show's Richard O'Brien), which will take them to the staff Profion is after. Also starring Tom Baker (best known for Doctor Who and Little Britain) as Halvarth. Well, where I start? Irons is a rubbish pantomime villains, Whalin proves again to be a lame leading actor, Wayans is alright (but killed off too soon), and Birch reminds me too much of a lame queen Natalie Portman in the Star Wars prequels. As for the film itself, the story fails, the CGI special effects look cheap, there is just nothing good to say about it. Poor! "}]
