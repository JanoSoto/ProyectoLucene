[{"Title":"Let's Get Real!","Date":"10 May 2000","Score":"53 out of 54 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  I rented the movie Double Jeopardy one evening and was skipping through the previews when I saw the trailer for this movie. I had heard about it before from a few friends who had seen it and had read about it in TIME magazine, not knowing much about the movie. Growing up in a household where being different in that sense is not acceptable, it has been hard for me to deal with my issues without support from my parents. I went to the local video store a few nights ago and immediately picked out Get Real to watch and enjoy. What I didn't expect was how true to life this movie really is!Get Real is the story about a 16-year old gay teenager named Steven Carter (played by the boyishly adorable Ben Silverstone) who has known about himself since he was 11-years old and is perfectly fine with it. Although he is dying to be accepted for who he is and not for who he pretends to be, he is afraid to tell his peers and his parents about his true nature. Only his best friend Linda (Charlotte Brittain, who delivers a terrific performance) knows and is worried about Steven, due to his sexual adventures at a gay men's restroom in a park. But one day, he unexpectedly has an encounter with the straight high school jock John Dixon (Brad Gorton, who plays his role of someone with much sexual confusion with complete realism) and the two boys fall in love. Steven wants to be open about the relationship, while John wants to hide his love for Steve. These differences, along with many others than I will not spoil for those who have not seen this, lead to one of the most tear-jerking endings I have ever seen in a movie.Bravo to everyone involved for creating such a realistic story! Being gay is not easy these days, especially for teenagers, but we all wish we were as brave as Steven, who matures as the movie goes on and we all hope the best for him as he embarks on his emotional recovery after the end of this movie. Way to go Steven!If you haven't seen this movie, see it soon! It is worth your every buck!RATING 10 out of 10!Rent this m "},{"Title":"WONDERFUL representation of real life young people.","Date":"19 March 2000","Score":"40 out of 41 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  Could a more realistic demonstration of what it is like to be young exist than this film?  Don't think so.  A lot of talk centers around how hard growing up is for teenagers.  Yet seldom is it mentioned that however hard it is for straight kids to grow up, it is a million times harder for gay kids, who have no one to turn to for help - not friends, not teachers, not parents, not the church, not books, not counselors, not ANYONE.  This film shows what it is like.  And it further shows the horrid situation that a young gay athlete finds himself in, torn between being able to do what he enjoys (sports) and being able to be himself.  When you're gay, you can't have both, thanks to the homophobia which still rules athletics with an iron fist.The two main characters of this film struggle to maintain a relationship, because they are in love - yet ultimately the homophobic attitudes of the world force them to part.  Tragic, yet it is a tale that plays itself out in every little town on the globe.  In spite of this, it is a tale  never before told on film.  It's about time.  This should be required viewing for all high school students.

The situations that arise, when one finds themselves serving too many masters, are portrayed in a moving, heart warming manner. A great balance of relevant humor and teenage emotional tribulation is struck, without so much as a gram of maudlin melodrama, which normally crops up in films of this nature (especially American ones). In the good ol' USA, teenage development in movies tend to be played for laughs or for mawkish sentiment, which could propel whining into an Olympic event.In a short summation, Steve Carter, the main protagonist, finds the path to love strewn with thorns. His friend and counsel, Linda, walks the same road. Steve in discovering himself, discovers that anguish is also a companion to love.    GET REAL does just that in such an honest, disarming way, that it exudes originality. The performances and characterizations, are far ranging and finely realized. There's not a weak link in the chain, either in performance, script execution or direction. Innovative and fresh from start to finish. A contemporary classic that is highly recommended.      "},{"Title":"A small but important movie - see it","Date":"19 October 2004","Score":"28 out of 31 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" The lives of gay people are full of the stuff that makes for drama; inner conflicts, self acceptance, conformity, family tensions and many other issues gay people are forced to confront. Whether it's the late start or lack of a tradition, the genre of the gay movie has very little quality on offer. American cinema has been particularly weak in this area. The AIDS epidemic has been handled with more assurance than the inherent ordeals gay people face. There have been many stereotypical, predictable and basically forgettable gay movies over the years. The Boys in the Band made over 30 years ago still stands out as a major gay film; indeed a sorry state of affairs.European cinema has fared far more successfully with matters gay, with such fine works as Wild Reeds and the outstanding Come Undone. It comes as much of a surprise that the stodgy British cinema should have produced some of the landmark gay movies, amongst them the brave Victim (1961) made when homosexuality was still against the law and John Schlesinger's fiercely intelligent Sunday Bloody Sunday (1970). While Get Real is no masterpiece, it certainly is one of the most important gay themed films of the past few years.Its importance lies in the lesson it so succinctly delivers. It's not a film directed especially at gay audiences and should be seen by all, especially high school audiences for whom it should be compulsory viewing.The casting of Ben Silverstone was inspired. He manages to be totally convincing throughout, even pulling off the perhaps unlikely speech he delivers in the finale. Brad Gorton as his conflicted love interest has some truly moving moments. Director Simon Shore also elicits fine performances from the secondary characters, in particular Charlotte Brittain in the fag hag, fat friend role. It could have gone very wrong in lesser hands, but Brittain is a joy to watch and brings a lovely sense of humor to the proceedings.Ultimately it's a truly unpretentious and very moving movie, far more effective than Beautiful Thing. Don't miss it.

This is one of those movies that you can see again and again and never become tired of - for my money, it ranks up there with It's A Wonderful Life and Belle Epoque, as both an artistic success and a story of the triumph of the human spirit. The leads are magnificent - Ben Silverstone is more than a little swoonsome, and Brad Gorton switches from smooth as silk to blubbering jelly with just a twitch - and to all of you wondering why John would fall for Steven, wouldn't you want a boyfriend who makes you laugh, forces you to take risks, and to generally put yourself at ease?

He has long since decided he is gay but only meets men in the park for sex.  When one of the people he meets in the park toilets turns out to be none other than the hunky head boy, Steve is unsure where he stands.  However their relationship grows into lovers and they both balance the feelings brought around by secrecy and feeling like no one understands.From the sparky opening and good sense of humour, I had expected this film would just be another in the line of Richard Curtis-lite style of British romantic comedies.  Indeed it does have this feel to it throughout - it has some good songs on the soundtrack and much of it is funny in that bittersweet way that British rom-coms seem to have claimed as their own. However what made this such a good film is the fact that it is a lot more sensitive and moving than most of this genre ends up being.  The plot may well drag a little at times, but it never really seems unrealistic or dull.The characters are part of the reason it does so well.  It is rare in the mainstream to see gay characters portrayed fairly and without caricature - HBO's 6 Feet Under is one of the rare ones, but this does as well.  I wish that all those who hold up `Will & Grace' as a milestone in gays in the mainstream could all sit and see how much better it is when done like this! The dialogue is good and none of the characters are fake or pointless.  Of course some react the way you expect them to, but the fact that they have been drawn well stops them being lazy - just broad.  The film is weak in some pretty important areas however.  The main one being the lack of relationship between Steven and John - I never saw them together and all they had in common is their sexuality.The cast do pretty well with the characters, even if some of them are being held up by the good script.  Silverstone is great in the lead - he gives a really low key performance that even extents to his `speech' scene - where he could have really hammed it up some.  Gorton is not as good but does do sterling work.  The support cast are mixed although all do their jobs ably enough.Overall this is a great little film that will never get the same success as the Richard Curtis comedies from which it borrows a bit of it's style, however the script is really strong and it is quite unarming in how well it deals with the issues without cliché or lazy caricature of characters.

The mixed-up measures they take to express themselves and give expression to their feelings of desire and adolescent lust, suppressed by community morality and repressed by personal fear and self-hatred, unfolds over the London suburb of Basinbroke where a stick figure of a 16-year-old--Steven Carter--sits in or outside a public bathroom, trying to make contact with someone.  He finds it unexpectedly with the big man on the high-school campus who garners immeasurable pleasure from their private meetings, but cannot bear the thought of being outed.  The story passes through a grist mill of situations that leave the viewer with the simplistic notion that everything will be fine, if you just have the courage to be yourself with others.  If it were that easy, I'm sure Brandon Teena would still be alive today.Adapted from Patrick Wilde's play What's wrong with being angry, Get Real sends a manifesto to parents and teachers about the supposed pressures they may be putting on their children, gay or otherwise.  If you're willing to accept it on this level, the movie functions as an emotional release for all those pent-up gay teenagers who couldn't vent their anger and frustrations at the forces that impose on their burgeoning dreams.  But if you try to take it any deeper, then you'd have to consider the internal struggles of John Dixon, the object of Steven's desire, because that is one of the few places in this movie where something is at stake.  Johnny (as Steven likes to call him) travels a thornier road, and although Brad Gorton doesn't quite seem up to the challenge, his self-conscious jock does not seem so much a coward in the end as someone saddled with all the trappings of his gentrified upbringing who doesn't want to let go of them.  Johnny Boy's smart, but like all teenagers, he's thwarted by desires that defy his good sense.And that is a shame, because if there ever was reason to give up everything for love, Ben Silverstone would be it.  He is the real find in this picture.  He's the most elegantly constructed scarecrow to touch the silver screen (Seeing him, Conrad Veidt and The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari come to mind.), and it's amazing what calm he brings to the center of this movie.  Unlike newcomer Gorton, the camera loves Silverstone, and it takes him in as if he were born to be in front of it.  If that weren't enough, this young actor (He is about the same age that Steve should be.) has a voice that rivals Jeremy Irons for expressiveness and majesty.  Imagine him as Hamlet or Edward II or in a remake of Brideshead Revisited and that sultry sound pouring forth in velvety plenitude.  Why, it's enough to make you stand up and salute the Queen Mother.With Stacy Hart as the iridescent Jessica whose dance with Steve is probably the sexiest scene in the entire movie.

I felt this film was an excellent exploration of homosexuality in the heart of Middle Class Britain. I lived close to the film's location Basingstoke when this was made and am the same age (give or take a year) as the main character, Stephen. Whilst never being as confident in my sexuality as Stephen, I really connected with the story told, his relationship with his parents and the scatter-shot but inadvertently appropriate use of homophobic abuse by the bullies.Also thought the excellent flashes of dialogue uplifted the film such as Whenever I see that badge (Head Boy) I wish it were an invitation. Priceless. The performances are almost perfect through out (I was a little unconvinced by Jon the Head Boy to begin with but warmed to him hugely as the film and love story progressed.) The cinematography is suitably understated and this is not the most cinematic film ever shot, which I feel helps with the realism. Some of the symbolism is quite fantastic, especially the closing shot, which I wont spoil.I found it to be a much more recognisable film for me than Brokeback Mountain, Not to that films detriment, it is a masterpiece but I may feel closer to this because I have regularly been to the Odean in Basingstoke, but have never herded sheep on a snowy mountainside with Jake Gyllenhall. It is a simple effective narrative about a subject close to my heart and I recommend it highly.

Directed with taste and delicacy by Simon Shore and written by Patrick Wilde a relative of Oscar? with some pretty fantastic performances by the leads.  You believe everything they go through.  You feel the frustration and the embarrassing situations they run into.  The conflicts, the desires, the explorations of each other's sexuality and the honesty of a special relationship.  Unfortunately, in this situation, the differences of class, age and strength of character makes the outcome predictable. But, along the way it tells a beautiful love story between two guys in school one quiet and shy, the other a popular jock on the rugby field, who by chance, happen to encounter each other's secret in a public toilet in the park.  Unknowingly, they make plans by sending each other notes on toilet paper under the stalls.  Then once out in the sunlight, they recognize the other's identity.  Well played scene by both actors. The scene where John, the jock played beautifully by Brad Gorton, talks of his secret pleasures with other male bodies and his torment in keeping it inside of him, was wonderful.  And the way Steven, played by the wonderful Ben Silverstone, held him in his arms and comforted him brought tears to my eyes.  So delicate a scene.   Their first kiss took my breath away.   Other notable performances were by the delightful Charlotte Brittain as Steven's next door neighbor best girl buddy.  Her scenes with Steven Elder as her driving instructor were hysterical.  Also her fainting scene at the wedding to get Steven out of the party and to his boyfriend was funny.  I also liked Jacquetta May and David Lumsden as Steven's parents.  They were played with sensitivity and depth.  Even though Dad had to go further in understanding his son, Mom was there.  The scene where she challenges the school bully, picking on her son, brought cheers from this viewer.  But, alas, we aren't granted a happy ending in this movie.  The one downer in the picture.  Thought the ending was weak and sort of wasted after building to such a climax.   Steven's confession to his classmates, deserved better than a brush-off by John and a car ride with Linda.  Boo!  Up till then, a classic film with excellent acting by all.  9 out of 10 points from this viewer.

Few movies have the power to move you, and this one did me.I felt Steven's pain as he pined for the Brad Gorton character, John, especially after the two hooked up. John was the macho and popular jock, and had to keep up appearances, even if it meant humiliating Steven publicly with his friends.The scene that meant the most to me and that resonated the most with me was the scene in the gym where Steven was dancing with his best girlfriend and John was with his girlfriend. The two barely took their eyes off each other. I, myself, have experienced such a moment. Not quite the same as that where I wasn't dancing with anyone at the time, but the girl I loved and still love was, and we maintained eye contact despite her dancing with someone else. That scene ripped at my heartstrings.I don't know if John was in love with Steven. Possibly. But Steven was in love with John. Steven came out at the end in a most dramatic way at a school assembly when he accepted an award with John looking on, but John never came out at all. John, in my estimation, was bisexual or bi-curious and not a confirmed homosexual like Steven. Maybe I am wrong about that. We don't know. It seems that the two of them did not get back together by the end, and we as the audience were left hanging and left to guess what happened after the dramatic school assembly coming out.The movie is funny, charming, somewhat kitschy, and poignant. I recommend it to any young person, straight or gay, and any old person who wants to re-live the pangs of youth and unrequited (or requited... if temporarily as here) first love.

Looking back at this film and when it was released (1999 in the USA) it is startling that the sexual repression that is so prevalent in the film, can still exist in this day and age. The film Maurice (1987) took place in 1910 and the repression was worse and yet that film had a much more positive ending.In 'Get Real' the two characters, Steven Carter and John Dixon couldn't be more different in their sexual experiences. It's Steven Carter the younger boy who has had more sexual contact with men and its John Dixon who is unable to deal with his sexual feelings. I find that the character, John Dixon, is the most fascinating of the two boys because he is living a double life. He presents an image of strong, athletic and smart, but he is also filled with anxiety, confusion and doubts.Like the most of us. John Dixon's greatest fear is that people will find out about his true sexual identity. In the end John Dixon is in severe denial, he is blind to the reality of his sexuality and but it cannot be denied. Is this love these two boys are experiencing? This is a newly discovered sexual companionship, and a very deep emotional connection that neither one has ever experienced before.It is all new and exciting. This intensity clouds what is really happening to them.The only way they can express honesty to each other is for the boys to reach for some booze, that is the only way some very painful truths will surface. There are two very powerful and revealing scenes that are key to the whole film and that are emotionally raw and memorable. Yet they make promises they never can keep. John Dixon was so afraid of any one finding out he was gay, that he piled on needless lies, to his parents and friends and then he began to resent Steven and despise himself.These two boy's were very dependent on one another and the result was they became very needy, which then had the effect of suffocating one another. They needed to come up for some air.Sadly, John Dixon doesn't realize that a lot of Steven's friends and family know about him. John's friend's suspect the truth and so does his father. He could of said something to them, but that is easier said than done.John Dixon is so consumed by fear he can't see 'straight'. John strikes back at Steven Carter in a most vicious way. John Dixon tells Steven Carter that he loves him but his actions reveal the real truth. It's not how you 'feel' towards someone that shows you love them. It is how you treat them, and that is with respect and decency. Is this love or hate?

Sequel!","Date":"23 April 2002","Score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  SPOILERS I discovered `Get Real' quite by a wonderful accident.  While thumbing through a video guide looking for a review of the original 1960s `Get Carter' with Michael Caine, I stumbled upon the `Get Real' review.  I promptly borrowed the film from my video club for a week and looked at it, end to end, 8 times.  I was impressed by the marvellous performances of the actors and the charm of the storytelling.  There's no point in further rehashing all the film's positives, which are quite well covered by other contributors here.Like many others, I found the ending unsatisfying.  It defies belief that Steven's catharsis over coming out in front of the whole school (itself not quite credible) is so liberating that he can just turn his back on John, whom he loves so deeply, and go off driving with Linda, completely inured against pain, with the radio blaring `Freedom!' in heavy-handed symbolism. Plus, what about John?  Steven's hurts are given pride of place in the narrative.  I agree, however, with `smeads00' below, who points out that it is John's experience which is the more harrowing because he has still not fully come to terms with his sexuality and proves himself capable of violence against Steven, whom he truly loves, to divert suspicion away from himself and to placate his homophobic buddies.  That psychological conflict cries out for resolution.  Though the narrative hints early on that John will opt for the safe and sure (Oxford, wife and kids), the very fact of his open friendship with Steven, after his initial paranoia, suggests a promising psychological evolution, of watching whose further development the viewer is cheated.I add my voice to all those others who are saying, `Sequel! Sequel! Sequel!' All of the subplots are tied up by the movie's end Linda and the driving instructor; Mark and Wendy; the Carters, Steven and Jessica.  Yet the main plot is left hanging in suspense.  Of his final work, `Maurice', E. M. Forster wrote `I was determined that in fiction anyway two men should fall in love and remain in it for the ever and ever that fiction allows, and in this sense Maurice and Alec still roam the greenwood'. Forster resolved to fly in the face of convention and give a narrative of gay love a happy ending.  To the contrary, it seems that director Shore chose the easy, conventional path and let the lovers suffer and break up, though loving each other deeply.  I agree with `boiofatlantis' (lower down) who says that `Get Real' tells the typical coming-out story `boy meets and falls for boy but does not get to keep him'.  I firmly agree with him that `this standard needs to be changed'.  I also agree with `Brandy 28' who claims, `just once I would like to see a movie like this end the way it sometimes happens in real life.'There would be much to explore in a sequel, obviously John's learning to `feel good' about himself, but also the actual evolution of the relationship between the two youths.  Like `smeads00' and `spacedog 7' both point out below, the viewer is practically not privy to this at all in `Get Real'.A final criticism couldn't the kissing scenes could have been a bit more prolonged?  They could at least have opened their mouths!

There is some wonderful playing around with the `damned if you do tell` `damned if you don`t tell` problem experienced by many gay men. Because of the very different ages of consent in various countries, and greater tolerance and humanity in many of them, the film may not have the same degree of urgency and polemic in all countries. The British on matters of sex are the most backward of all Europeans. Your average mainland European might think the story and some of the characters `do protest too much`. Although the U.S.A. seems to be a bit more progressive than than the U.K., I expect it has quite a lot of relevance there polemically, as Anglo-Saxon Attitudes are not unknown in the U.S.A. with regard to public virtues and private vices. The dramatic elements are very reasonable; it isn`t epic Greek tragedy, but the drama is plausible and held my attention throughout.I think there is a too predictable tendency for films of this `coming-out` genre to over rely on the friendly `fag-hag` sidekick character - such as appeared in the BBC Drama Two of Us, and subsequent films like Beautiful Thing , Parting Glances, and so on. The female friends of many Gay men are far more important in their lives, than merely being shoulders to cry on. Whereas `Beautiful Thing` combined social realism with urban fantasy - rather like the tradition of Scandinavian `magical-reality`, `Get Real` is polemical and realist yet without being humourless. `Get Real` is not better, or worse, than `Beautiful Thing` - it is different. `Beautiful Thing` is more oriented to the personal and private emotions and feelings experienced in coming out. `Get Real` has a harder social/public  activist edge to it, but it is not merely political There is an intelligent gentleness and strength in the narrative and lead characters that confronts a meaner stimulus-response world-view with courage and maturity. Moreover, `Get Real` is an example of how Gay Film can exceed the predictability and restricted rhetoric of `straight` film. `Get Real` for all its spell-it-out social realism, has delightful ambiguities and contradictions, which make it challenging for audiences, whether gay, bisexual, tran, straight, or indifferent. `Get Real` is, I think, a valuable contribution to the Gay Film repertoire, which is thankfully growing like never before. What is more, some straight friends and colleagues of mine have enjoyed it, and have said that low-budget Gay Films may have a wider general appeal than they had expected. So many thanks to everyone involved in planning, producing, performing in and distributing `Get Real` - you have honoured the Gay community with quality and integrity Our our culture is enriched, and many wounds are healed by your Art.  "},{"Title":"Nifty, but flawed","Date":"6 January 2001","Score":"5 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  In its themes and character development, Get Real is somewhere between Maurice and Beautiful Thing.  Steven Carter is basically the Maurice/Jamie character, while John Dixon might be destined to follow the path of Clive Durham (played by Hugh Grant in Maurice), who like Dixon, is a bit higher up in the British class sytem.I found myself charmed by the movie, but irritated.  Many say the film demands a sequel; and while I'd like to see such a work, the call for a sequel stems partly from the film's narrative inadequacies.  Ostensibly about Steven Carter coming out, Carter is nevertheless not the heart of the movie--especially one with the title Get Real.  Carter has already gotten real with himself.  But his coming out speech is a product of writer fiat and not particularly realistic in terms of how the film executes it (ie, given in front of the entire school).I felt the heart lay more with the other gay character, John Dixon, and this is where the movie frankly begins to cheat.  Ben Silverstone has garnered much deserved praise for portraying Steven, but Brad Gorton really has the harder job.  The Dixon character is much more complex, almost Jekyll and Hyde in the coin flip between fear and love, and how this person with a great underlying capacity for joy and tenderness is beaten down by demons both outer and inner.  John Dixon is a far more realistic character, and his inability to admit his homosexuality in a public manner is a much greater mirror of the times--and of gay history in its totality.  Also, this is a character who has just admitted to himself that he's gay--after that scene, the movie's timespan takes up barely, say, a few weeks worth of narration--imagine the kind of leap Steven is expecting John to make, when Steven has trouble being open and he's accepted his gayness for over 5 years.The greatest cheat comes when Kevin Grainger, one of John's friends and Steven's tormentors, finds Steven and John together in a swimming pool--in a pretty dodgy position (John is sitting on Steven's shoulders).  John is completely at peace with the situation--leading one to think, Ok, this character has accepted himself at last (the scene occurs after John has decided to openly allow others at their school to know he has formed a friendship with Steven, so the swimming pool scene seems like a natural progression).  John's subsequent actions are such a regression, they become a plot contrivance.The second cheat is the ending itself, which tries to tack on a happy conclusion that doesn't resolve any character conflicts--Steven gets into his friend Linda's car, and they drive off to an Aretha Franklin song. This is not getting real.  Had the filmmakers cut that scene in favor of about 10 more minutes of dialogue between John and Steven, this would be a much more superior movie.  It isn't necessary for the two to get together and start slow dancing on the soccer field, their relationship renewed; but it's far more real for two people who've been through a lot to sit and actually talk to each other, regardless of their emotions (unless it's utter hate, which is far from the case here).  These characters hardly exchange any meaningful talk at all, and that strikes me as laziness on the writer's part.The filmmakers are going for ambiguity regarding the future between Steven and John, and I respect that.  Steven's last words to John are a personal plea--Be happy.  This plea could go either way telling John to be happy in his life, which isn't going to involve Steven; or telling John to be happy about what I just did in there (ie, coming out so publicly), because it's going to serve as a model for John's subsequent liberation.  After all, John's father is already suspicious after John is caught lying about not knowing Steven.  Pointed questions about their friendship are bound to arise, and in a way one extrapolates that John has had the burden of coming out somewhat lifted from his shoulders by Steven's public outcry. Taken altogether, the movie hints that Steven's father will come around and that John and Steven will have their more romantic moments.In my mental sequel, anyway, the two end up being just fine.  But the two characters could have talked far more while still leaving the fate of their love relationship undetermined. These are both smart characters trying to figure themselves and each other out, and the movie missed a crucial moment to let them really spar with each other.  Others my well conclude that at this point in the action, the two have nothing further to say to each other. I can only disagree.All in all, a good movie--vastly superior to American teen flicks, which all seem to star Drew Barrymore or Freddie Prinze Jr. One last question if you were Steven Carter and had just spent your first night in bed naked with the love of your dreams, John Dixon, would you have gotten out of bed (with him still in it) to fix breakfast? To go to the bathroom?  Get real.

First of all, it avoids the ludicrous pitfall of thirty-somethings or twenty-somethings trying to play teenagers a la Olivia Newton John and John Travolta in Grease. That kind of inauthentic casting has ruined the verisimilitude and integrity of far too many movies about young people. Roger Ebert once said only half jokingly that there should be a law that actors playing young adults or children must be the age of their characters; and judging from some of the untenable performances turned in by older actors in movies of this genre, I'm inclined to agree with him. All the actors playing teenagers in this movie are believable as teenagers, and this authenticity is a decided asset. I found this movie poignant, touching and aptly awkward in places. It reminded me of high school life. The director and actors achieve just the right mix of erotic longing, real-world constraints, uncertainty and the tension of trying to build a self in a complicated world. Not quite as superb as its close cousin, Beautiful Thing, but very good nonetheless. Highly recommended to anyone fair-minded enough to appreciate a movie featuring gay characters.

The scenes of the public toilets of Blasingstoke were surprisingly frank, and I was wondering if this movie was going to take on a direction of a more of an adult soft-porn movie. I was glad when it didn't (really I was), and after watching it, I watched it several times before it's five-day rental expired. I then purchased it as soon as it became available on DVD.I have noticed this movie compared to Beautiful Thing several times. Obviously, they are both coming of age and out stories, both with one boy comfortable with his sexuality while the other at odds with his. However, with Beautiful Thing, (a film I also truly enjoyed) the premise is more between two boys while I feel Get Real is between two young men. It seems like the character of Steven Carter, already went through the stage Jamie of Beautiful Thing experienced. I guess Get Real can be thought of as somewhat like the sequel of Beautiful Thing.This movie ranks high for it's realism. I appreciated that throughout the movie. As someone who could identify with Steven at that age, Ben Silverstone, portrayed Steven perfectly-truly exemplifying what an insecure, gay teenager would experience at that stage of his life. His scene (spoiler ?) when he is waiting for John Dixon in the rain, crying with an empty bottle of wine they were to share, was on of the best.This movie ranks in my top five of gay-theme movies. If the ending of the movie was disappointing to some viewers, all I can say is Get Real.

Brad Gorton shines as his reluctant lover, bringing tender scenes of frustration and affection to terms in the film.  Charlotte Brittain rounds up the three main characters as the most hilarious fag hag on celluloid, enamoured of her driving instructor and endlessly dogging her gay best friend.Get Real is a roller coaster of intensity, getting as close as possible to Steven Carter's fears as an openly gay teenager.

The rather complex ending had its' good and bad points - the coming-out speech could've been sharper (this would've perhaps heightened the emotional tension of the scene), but I found the ending to be otherwise quite satisfactory - Steven, as a self-aware young gay man, possesses a strength and self-assurance that places him far ahead of John, whose cowardly retreats into violence betray a confusion that will only create problems in other people's lives until he gains the strength to work things out for himself. No strong, self-aware human being should ever need to put up with getting literally kicked around, which Steven is smart enough to already know, which his why he can ride off into the sunset loveless but confident - such a liberated ending (while no 'happily-ever-after' romance) more than validates the occasional 'after-school-special' moments that preceded it.There are many moments here that could form the basis for any number of provocative follow-ups the contradictions of John, or the relationships - supportive or otherwise - with parents (grossly under-explored in gay drama) or teachers.

For this is rather a sweet little film with such a likable central character, Stephen, a most appealing youth caught up in the problems of coming out in a mainly homophobic society, that you somehow just go along with the journeys he makes toward understanding himself and the understanding of others. Indeed the fact that he finds the former journey the easier is in many ways a measure of the film's basic honesty. So sit back and enjoy a 90's message film ( I imagine attitudes are a shade more enlightened now), strangely couched in the comfy British style of Gregory's Girl and occasionally just as funny.

The jock seemed overly mercurial and the main character at times seemed annoyingly insensitive to the jock's desire to protect his fragile self-image in the mean streets of secondary school, but then real people aren't always consistent with our expectations and they often display irrational self-defeating behavior.

It's a fantasy (the idea of the best-looking, most popular boy being your lover), and it could have been maudlin and embarrassing, but the players, especially Ben Silverstone, handle it with such empathy, that you can't help but be drawn in and route for Ben's eventual happiness.

I'm unable to think of another young actor who is able to convey emotions so well.I grew up in a small town, not entirely unlike Basingstoke, in a London suburb and know how hard it is for young gay men. My best friend at school was gay and he endured a daily torture keeping it hidden from his family, most of his friends and all the homophobic oafs we went to school with (think Kevin Granger if you've seen the film). As I watched Get Real, memories of his emotions and problems came rushing back to me.It would have been so easy for Get Real to have been a predictable, sentimental nothing of a film, but the strong story, funny, touching script and superb cast made it one of the best british films ever made.If you want to be inspired and amazed, watch Get Real.

The overwhelming fear of discovery that every young gay person experiences is dealt with very successfully, here -- as is the secret attraction one inevitably feels for special friends.  The difference, here, is that the object of Steve's affection is likewise gay.  If it weren't for the difficulties these two young lovers face simply loving one another, I would be tempted to say that the fact of their mutual attraction is almost too good to be true.  But there ARE difficulties and these are what bring the film back to earth.  The difficultly of gay adolescence is captured perfectly.

Several other commentators have likened this film to Beautiful Thing, based on the play by Jonathan Harvey. As a great fan or Beautiful Thing and Harvey's work in general, I can honestly say that Get Real is better.Based in the commuter town of Basingstoke, south of London, this film took me on a rollercoaster ride of emotions from joy to sadness. It touched the heart strings like few films manage to do as the central character explored his sexuality for the first time, fell in love and grew in confidence. Brilliantly acted by Ben Silverstone and Brad Gorton (who many British readers will know more recently as Dan in ITV's London's Burning), these two actors portrayed their characters with stunning passion and energy.The film suffered slightly from a dose of Rose Coloured Spectacles and lacked some of the hardness that other gay plots have shown in the past (particularly the recent screening on British Television of Queer as Folk). But, the film had a very large dose of the feel good factor that enhanced the story and left viewers feeling that much better about themselves. Occasionally doses of comedy also helped to lift the story at times.I am sure open-minded straight viewers would benefit from the story and give them a better understanding of what young gay men go through. A gay audience, naturally, will identify and understand some of the underlying themes of the film. However, I am not sure that a cynical straight audience would benefit from it as much as the film had hoped they might.As a gay man watching a gay film, I'd give it full marks, but for a more general audience, it probably needs to be marked down slightly as the film does assume a certain knowledge and understanding of the issues presented. Having said that, I personally thoroughly enjoyed it.

Brad Gorton looking like a young Hugh Grant but with curlier hair plays John, the Head Boy at their school.This movie is teen angst with a few twists. Now that we're in the late 1990's, gay love among young boys can be shown on the screen. Steven knows he's gay, has known this since he was 11 years old, and has no problems with being gay. His problem is the universal teenager's problem, how to find a good partner. So his partner has to be a boy, but this is no big deal. Matter of fact he has things a bit easier than other boys who are looking for girl partners. Steven's a thoroughly modern boy.But John has problems accepting that he is gay. Still, he falls for Steven. See them deal with the universal problem, how to spend private time with a lover without both sets of parents finding out. Of course, John has the much bigger problem of concealing his gay nature from everyone except Steven.Two other films come to mind with similar themes.Wild Reeds from France also deals with gay love between two schoolboys. And it used a terrific soundtrack of 1950's pop as an effective background, just as Get Real uses a 1990's pop sound track. However, in France of the 1950's neither of the boys could be openly gay, or even freely accept gayness as part of his being, the way Steven can.Grease also uses a terrific soundtrack as background to teenage angst. Though in this case it's all boy-girl romance and there isn't a gay hint to the movie. Yet some of the situations are the same - how to make the object of your love return the affection, how to meet privately, and how to consumate the romance.The only unreal part of this movie is the Hollywood portrayal of Basingstoke in England - upper class suburban, all nice houses and cars, two parent families. And quite unlike today's England, not a minority person in sight!Get Real with its realistic portrayal of gay adolescence should be mandatory viewing at all schools. To show the kids that it is OK to be gay. That it's OK to be gay and happy. That tolerance and understanding are best. That it's not OK to beat up on gay kids just for being gay.

Light flick about the stormy first love affair between the unwanted, unloved, intelligent gay teenager who will no doubt grow up to become a successful out and proud journalist or playwright (stereotype), and his athletic, popular, upper middle-class, good-looking 'straight' school mate who obviously has not yet had a single original thought in his life, and, by the looks of it, will have had precious few by the time he graduates from Oxford (stereotype). Comic relief courtesy of the fat, melodramatic girl next door who nibbles too much chocolate, to hide her essential uncertainty and need for love (stereotype). There is also, of course, the dastardly villain whose hairline is kept from plummeting only by his sturdy mono-brow (stereotype), the 'progressive' Eng.Lit. teacher who constantly gives the impression of having a ponytail (stereotype), and the loving mother who suspected all along... (stereotype). Of course all of this is more than made up for by the father, who, instead of being the newspaper-reading dullard who likes his soccer televised, is actually a photographer and science-fiction fan who even dons a space suit for his convention visits.But it was a delight to see the actors make those stereotypes come to life. The overall result was recognizable, tragic and funny. Sentimental, but then so am I. The Steven character comes away stronger for his ordeals, while the John Dixon character has Michael Portillo written all over him but what makes the ending worthwhile is the fact that Dixon may save himself yet. Given a miracle or two.Oh, and - to paraphrase an earlier review - there remains the question why an intelligent, good-looking boy like Steven would fall for an obvious fake like John. I mean, it isn't as if he is even that attractive. Tall, dark and tanned yes, but a blockhead nonetheless, hopelessly caught up in the mores of his milieu and the pressure of what is 'expected' of him.But what really grabbed me was the intolerance and bigotry portrayed here. I could not believe that in a 'civilized' country like the UK a school paper would be forbidden from publishing an article featuring homosexuality. I had a very similar experience at Steven's age, writing an article for the school paper to express my loneliness, and no one would even think of censoring it. This was in 1982; school magazines were edited and set by hand instead of on a flashy Macintosh; teenagers did NOT have a PC on the desk in their bedroom. But my article was published. Of course in the Netherlands there was no Section 28. If this picture of modern day UK is accurate, God Help The Queen.

In fact, the most I'd ever seen a movie before this in a theater was Titanic (8 times).The movie's success was anchored in the performance by Ben Silverstone. I had never seen him in his two previous performances (Lolita and Browning Version) but he was exceptional, hitting the perfect balance between subtlety and power. I can't imagine anyone else in the role. It was easy to imagine even an athlete like John Dixon falling for the 'outcast' Steven Carter. His eyes showed remarkable emotion. I can imagine him playing anything from evil to heartthrob.I was also impressed with the supporting cast. Although a stereotype (albeit a fairly true one), Charlotte Brittain furnished wonderful comic relief as Linda. Her relationship with Steven was special and I didn't mind the sub-plot with the driving instructor. Brad Gorton as John Dixon bothered me in the first couple of viewings, but the more I saw the film, the more he felt right for the part. I wasn't sure about his wavering secrecy and then aloofness about his relationship with Steven, but he was very confused. As one review noted - right or wrong - he had a lot more to lose upon discovery than Steven. Stacey Hart was sweet as Jessica. And the actors playing Mark, Wendy and Kevin (the cad), all had their moments.As for the film itself, I loved the direction of Simon. Although the music was formulaic for the most part, the camera work was exceptional. I particularly loved the dance scenes with the hand-held camera. Masterful timing and mood! And the plot was simply heart grabbing. I smiled and cried - often at the same scenes. The ending was no 'happy ever after' but it was more truthful. It's one of the few times that a 'disappointing' ending didn't leave me unsatisfied.It's my favorite gay-themed film of all time and I never expected anything to top Torch Song Trilogy. A Beautiful Thing was good but nowhere near Get Real.

What a remarkably subtle but powerful performance by this somewhat newcomer to UK film. Can't wait to see his future films. His eyes did an incredible amount of emotional storytelling. You felt his pain and his glory. There were some holes in the storyline, such as athlete John Dixon's switch from secretiveness to aloofness about their relationship, but then he was pretty confused. I read one review that probably said it best - John had much more to lose by revealing his orientation than Steven Carter. Still, I love characters that show bravery that I probably never would in the face of the same situation. While I teetered on whether Brad Gorton's performance was really all that great, I really enjoyed that of the two other principles - Charlotte Brittain (Linda) and Stacy Hurt (Jessica). Though a stereotype, Brittain played it to the hilt and Hurt hit just the right chord of sweet and jilted. Director Simon does a superb job with the camera. The dance scene was mesmerizing in the way it was presented with the hand-held cam. Beautifully photographed. Some of the music was a bit overdone however.

But Get Real can stand on its own. It's a wonderful look at a first love relationship, where the two people involved fit together pretty well, except they're at different places on the emotional development scale, and so can't be together now. (Five years on, though, they just might work. Too bad there won't be a sequel.)The performances in Get Real are uniformly excellent, especially Ben Silverstone as Steven, Brad Gorton as John, and Charlotte Brittain as Linda. Simply put, Silverstone needs to leave Cambridge ASAP and continue acting; he's too good to lose from the movie screen. The role of Steven requires him to walk an emotional line, between too giddy at love and too pragmatic, too secretive and too vulnerable, and Silverstone pulls it off beautifully. Likewise, it would have been too easy to make the character of John one-dimensional and frustrating, sort of like, Why won't this guy just come out? But Brad Gorton does a marvelous job of showing John's fears (which are legitimate) and his conflicted feelings. (Plus, he keeps the teary confession scene from becoming maudlin; in the theater, it felt like the audience members were on the edge of our seats, even though we all knew where the scene was headed.) And Charlotte Brittain as Linda is hilarious (luckily, she gets her own storyline, although unfortunately, it's not nearly large enough).Also, as someone who's used to seeing high school sophomores played by 24-year-olds, it was very refreshing to see a film where the teenagers were played by teenagers. It lent the whole enterprise an extra dollop of reality, so a big thank you to Graphite Films and everyone in the casting department for Get Real.

Brad Gorton has the harder part as heartthrob/athlete John Dixon,  who is in peak form physically, but confused and anguished mentally. Charlotte Brittain, as Steven's mate Linda, gets a lot of the best lines in a script filled with great lines.  Memorable scenes include Steven's cruising of the park toilet as The Troggs sing Love is All Around, John telling Steven of the time when he first responded to the touch of another boy on a school outing to Cornwall, and Steven announcement, to an assembly of classmates, teachers and parents, that he has been living a lie.There isn't a weak performance in the film, and the choice of Basingstoke, England, with its almost U.S.suburbs appearance -- complete with a red Corvette -- gives it a universal appeal.Some of the dialog passes a bit too quickly for an American ear to catch every word, but this is a minor complaint. The lush cinematography and widescreen views make for a good looking film as well.

Past films with gay characters have demonstrated them as ancillary clowns exclusively for the purposes of laughter.  Rarely did I ever see a serious film about gay people so others (including my own self) could see us as human beings who are uniquely different.  Get Real captures such qualities realistically and beautifully.  This film should also be part of classroom curriculums to teach tolerance and acceptance of gay teens who maybe emotionally distraught as is.  Get Real is also an excellent accompaniment to Beautiful Thing, a UK production of identical filmic caliber.

The story focuses on one shy kid, the victim of bullies, who gets a crush on the totally likable school jock and makes a surprising discovery. Natural young actors give their all, yet these aren't cardboard cut-outs but flesh and blood young people with secrets and insecurities. Even the parents are filled with multiple dimensions, and while there are some homophobic bullies, they are presented fairly as well.The acting is sublime with the two young leads attractive but not cardboard cookie cut-outs. Their desires are real, and while there is a sequence that presents an obvious carnal knowledge scenario, the way it is presented isn't done for shock, only insinuating a liaison between someone underage and an obviously older man with an obvious secret life. The ending gets truly gripping as the secrets of the supposedly straight jock are threatened with revelation. But even though there are a violent turn of events that aren't in keeping with what had come before, but they make absolute sense. The ending may have you sobbing. If just one out of ten homophobes can see this film and change their tune, then this film has done more than its duty.

Steven was so good to him and honestly, any man would have him as his boyfriend. John let him down completely and thats why I think the ending didn't have a good happy ending. I wish Steven would report the bullies to the principal as they made his life hell and his relationship even more worse. I then thought the father didn't want to help at all. He just made a fuss on his son's choice of love. At least the mother had common sense.I loved Linda, she's like the friend you seriously want to pal around with.

I've never seen any other movie that seemed so downright profound.The movie affected me on two levels it's a very touching romance with an ending that is so very sad; I often want to re-write the ending so that these guys can and will stay together. I find it totally believable that Steven and John would fall in love with one another, and I believe it every time they express their love to each other. One of the most romantic, albeit brief, moments is when John invites Steven to come live with me. But the romantic story has such a sad ending; surely there has to be a way for Steven to forgive John for the violence that John inflicted in the locker room, and forgiveness CAN happen if John tells the truth about himself to his parents and friends.That leads me to talk about the other way the movie affects me; the movie conveys, as its implicit moral, how important it is to reveal the truth about yourself to others, to come out. When I saw the movie circa 2001 or so, I found Steven's speech in the assembly hall was utterly inspiring. That speech, and the issues involved in why Steven and John break up, made me decide that I'm going to tell the truth to more people whom I have not previously told the whole truth, that I'm not going to stay closeted from anyone who deserves to know the truth. Indeed, a couple of years after I first saw the movie, I revealed that I'm gay to a room full of straight people, only one of whom already knew it.The tears John is shedding the first night he spends with Steven - the tears that start flowing when he admits to himself that he is gay - are based on two emotions fear and shame. The fear is that he'll lose the love and support of his parents and he'll lose his status as the school's Head Boy. But he's also ashamed of just plain being gay. John asks, through tear-filled eyes, as he looks into Steven's eyes, What's wrong with me? And in an important scene later, when Steven is angry with John for going out on a date with Christina, John confesses (with sadness in his eyes), I guess I went out with Christina tonight because I needed to feel good about myself. The most important reason why Steven and John break up at the end is not that John is afraid of being found out, but because of the contrast between Steven's gay pride and John's gay shame. Steven said (the night of John's date with Christina)I want you to be proud of us, but you're not! You're ashamed to be seen with me! Even though John then promised to talk to Steven and treat him like a friend while they're in school, that is not what Steven meant by be proud of us. John can't take any pride in his love for Steven unless and until John gets over the feeling of shame in just being gay.So that is why I fell in love with this movie it sends profound messages about the meaning of gay pride and in the importance of telling people the truth about yourself. Steven could have spared Jessica some heartache if he had told her, when Jessica gave Steven a kiss, that he's gay, and he would have told her the truth if it weren't for his (implied) promise to John that he was going to keep it a secret. Steven's desire to tell his parents and his classmates the truth about himself started to grow once he and John fell in love. That's when his gay pride began to grow, and it was why he wrote the little essay about what is it like to be a gay teenager.I have only a few complaints about the movie. One is a scene, at about 44 minutes in, that starts with John saying to Steven, Please, help me. I'm worried; I'm confused, and which culminates in a tender kiss. This scene lasted 6 minutes and I think the director/actors could have trimmed it a little bit, making it 5 minutes instead. That scene has about one minute of monologue by John that seemed unnecessary. And that scene is followed, in terms of when we next see them, by a scene in which Steven says to John You finished all the bacon yesterday, which means that they've spent an entire weekend together - two consecutive nights, and they've had breakfast together two consecutive mornings - but the whole day in between is missing. I would want to hear what Steven and John talk about the first day they spend an entire day together, a day right after John has finally admitted to himself that he's gay. Finally, I'm disappointed that, in the very last scene of the movie, Steven is smiling and joking as he gets into Linda's car and goes for a drive, as if he got over the grief of his breakup with John almost immediately after it happened. He had just been sniffling and fighting back tears a moment before. He got over a major heartache much too quickly.But a few minor quibbles like that are only worth mentioning because I do love the whole movie so much. I even think a lot of people who have moral objections to homosexuality and to the concept of gay pride could be touched by this movie.

It created quite a stir on the film festival circuits including Edinburgh, Toronto and Sundance. Pulled in acclaim and derision in equal measure from that odd bread of human called movie critics, yet were not quite so divided and loved this kooky British story of love and coming out from 1999.Sixteen year-old lanky Steven Carter is a boy with a secret, he cannot tell anyone he likes boys and not girls, except of course his slightly chubby best pal Linda, who seems old before her years. Oh and the occasional older bloke he picks up at the various public bogs around town, just to add that sleazy aspect to gay life that movies like to hit with. He wants to be a writer (Don't we all sugar!) and is already on the school newspaper team. He also cannot tell anyone that he has the hot's for John, the school hunk and head boy, who without out a doubt would be called a jock if this were an American made picture. He's the sporty handsome guy with prospects that your mum longed for you to bring home after school or before a date, except he's straight. John's current squeeze is a model, but he is not short of admirers, seems the whole school get moist whenever he is around.Before long, John and Steven finally meet, not at school, but in the cubicle of the local cottage, weird, odd, yes, I mean how many times do you strike up relationships with people you bump into during a random fumble in the dirty park bogs? However, hey, this is fiction and these sorts of things happen, besides, it helps the story develop and I am not being harsh, just honest. So anyway, as I say they strike up a friendship away from the seedy toilet sex and I don't mean swapping Match sticker cards at break time either, it's a full on love fest. However, this is Britain, supposedly modern times, this is school and John is supposedly straight, so they've got to keep their little romantic liaison secret, but as we all know, with secrets come lies and deceit and what a tangled web we weave when trying to keep our private life away from public eyes. There is a lovely little scene at the school prop when they dance with each other with their eyes alone, in reality, they are dancing with their respective prop dates, but their eyes are locked on each other, which is both touching and oddly strange. However, things all work themselves out in the end, with a few little spills along the way. It really is a nice little film, even though I seem to knock it a bit, it has some important messages, not least when it raises the spectre of homophobic bullying and the harsh bitter reality of classroom taunts and sports field aggression. Dark and light go together in this film, with comic moments and serious situations simmer along side by side quite nicely. There are some weak jokes in the script that reply on old and overused campy gags you would expect from Julian Clary or Graham Norton. Not often will a films DVD cover give the whole game away, usually it's just a slight flavour, but Get Real seems to not want you to watch by spelling out in American lingo most of the films plots and interests on the cover 'What if you can't avoid sexuality, guilt, peer pressure, lies, bigots, rumours, misunderstandings, nerds, jocks, romance, loneliness, shame and insecurity? Your only choice is to get real. School's out and so is Steven Carter.' It is such a shame because you know it has already put half the audience off, and that is the half that would really benefit from seeing it. Get Real is a lovely film, some key issues are brushed upon; other's mysteriously absent, but on the whole an engaging movie of surprising depth. It has the ability to make you laugh aloud at the funny bits and tear up at some of the not so happy bits. I am sure the appeal of this movie has much to do with the reminiscent quality its storyline evokes in much of the collective minds of the audience. Many of us have had similar experiences at school, dealt with the same crap and overcome the taunts and teen angst as we battled our way through the choice of either staying safe and ultimately unrewarded in the closet. Alternatively, risking the abuse, possible gay bashing and isolation of coming out and being the only gay in the school.

Why not? Sometimes being realistic means, indeed, to have no creative freedom and above all no real desire to escape ideological imprisonment.When Steven, a 16 year old student, starts frequenting public toilets hoping to hook up and have random sex with unknown men, he looks aloof and somehow emotionally unattached. His only confident is Linda, a girl somewhat ostracized because of her weight, and they come to a conclusion no matter how hard they've tried, love has not been a part of their lives.One day, in one of those public toilets the British seem so keen on visiting, he runs into John, another student from his high school. Except that John is not just another student, he happens to be the Golden Boy, not only is he the best athlete and the most handsome boy, he is also rich and very popular. Of course, John neutralizes possible misunderstandings by explaining that he just happened to be there. When Steven, disappointed and embarrassed, decides to depart, John asks him if his parents are home.In Steven's home, the game commences, or rather, what was already there comes to the surface. When John makes fun of a teddy bear in Steven's room, that soon leads into physical contact as Steven tries to retrieve the object from John's hands. Then, after being on top of each other, breathing hard and unmistakably excited, John proceeds to unbutton Steve's trousers and when they're about to kiss things get interrupted.The interruption is a symptom of society's intervention, which in this case does not take the form of an angry mob but rather the moral constraints that are deeply rooted in John's mind. If the gaze of the other defines us completely, then what must we do to be successfully inserted in society? For traditional psychoanalysis homosexuality has been a perversion, a mental illness, a condition that could be remedied, but it has also been the abject, id est, the vilest, the very lowest of the human condition. I would like to believe that much time has passed since then, but it's undeniable that some people, perhaps more than I would care to admit, continue to think as if they had been raised in the Victorian age.On the contrary, Steven has come to terms with his sexuality since he was 11. He has no doubts, no regrets. He feels only angry at the prejudiced people surrounding him at home, at school and everywhere in between. As his relationship with John progresses, they thrive to keep the secrecy, but the clandestine rendezvous and the constant hiding takes a toll on Steven. As John explains to him, they can do anything they want as long as no one else knows about it.Although at first this is hardly a limitation, soon the nature of the relationship will demand openness. Steven wants John to feel proud of them, of their relationship, he demands John to acknowledge him in school, not only outside. How long can they go keeping the secret? And is it really impossible to declare their love to everyone else? Be realistic, sometimes the impossible simply cannot be demanded for the very reason that it shouldn't have been deemed impossible in the first place.As the impossibility of accepting homosexuality is firmly placed in John's head, things will not be easy. But when other school kids start making enquiries and deductions, the entire relationship could come apart. Does this couple have what it takes to surmount seemingly unconquerable obstacles or was this a doomed affair from the very beginning?

Teens never talk in most films like they do amongst one another. Here, to a good degree, they do. The actors weave brilliantly between the awkward clumsiness and bold cockiness that most teens display. It isn't tiresome at all, it's refreshing and interesting. There is also a great amount of communication that isn't purely driven by dialogue and it's exceptional between the two main players. If you'd like to see a super film, with flawless acting all around, this is a delightful portrayal of two boys at very different places where self-acceptance is concerned.

They become lovers...but John doesn't want anyone to know and tells Stephen to keep it a secret. Stephen agrees but it's starting to tear him up inside.I saw this THREE times when it played at a small art cinema here (Massachusetts) back in 1998. It attracted a sizable crowd around here (for an R rated gay independent movie). It still works over 10 years later. It's well written and well-acted by the entire cast. Silverstone and Gorton are both str8 in real life but they play gay convincingly. Their kisses are passionate and there's one heart-breaking scene at a dance when they're dancing with their girlfriends and are looking into each others eyes sadly knowing they want to hold each other--but can't. There's nothing loud or explicit here like no nude sex scenes (how it got the R rating is beyond me). It only gets a 9 because there are a few problems. The ending seems really rushed and leaves a few plot streams hanging (mostly dealing with Gorton's character). Brittain is the comic relief and quickly becomes very annoying. These people are supposed to be 16 but it's pretty obvious they're WAY over that age! Lastly the British accents are VERY hard to understand at first. Still--well worth catching. Try to see this letterboxed--the full frame version cuts off a lot of information off the sides so some scenes play very badly--sometimes people are talking to somebody but you can't see who it is!

There was a rough edit here and there, but the lighting was flat-out gorgeous, and the cinematography overall very well done and very beautiful.Ben Silverstone plays Steven Carter, the main character, and he couldn't have done a better job.  He's believable, lovable and you find yourself attached to him very quickly.  His character grows a great deal from beginning to end, and he did a phenomenal job.  Brad Gorton, who plays his love interest, is relatively good, although he seems as if he'd have benefited from just a bit more directing.  I don't mean to sound as if he was *bad* (because by no means was his performance bad), but he had marginal room for improvement.  By the end of the movie Steven's mother and father (Jacquetta May and David Lumsden, respectively) both pop and come to life, as do most of the supporting characters.The story isn't one that will leave you with warm fuzzies the way that EDGE OF SEVENTEEN does, but it is a telling look at real life growing up gay.  It's also not quite as graphic and I feel like this movie might even be used as an effective tool to some extent for gay youth to come out to those (parents or friends alike) that they feel wouldn't understand.This is an understated picture that deserves a lot of applause.

I just finished watching Get Real and I remember almost every scene that Ben was in (which was 98% of the entire movie). Although DiCaprio does an excellent job of really getting into his character, Silverstone did a remarkable job of expressing the fears, stress, excitement and euphoria of being a gay high school student. Virtually Every Scene was perfect -- from the first scene on the park bench reading Shakespeare upside down to the final scene where he walks away from John at the stadium. I kept hoping for John to come 'out' and join Steve -- it would have been comforting to see two gay guys who really could Live Happily Ever After -- but the ending was more Realistic. My favorite scenes were 1) The dance where the camera showed Steve's longing look at John (wow); 2 and 3) John in Steve's room (first scene and drunk scene); 4) John on Steve's shoulders in the pool and of course 5) Ben Silverstone's speech at the awards ceremony.

In this film we meet Steven Carter Ben Silverstone, a schoolboy who is totally aware of himself as a gay teenager and equally aware of what the problems are being a gay teenager at school in Basingstoke - a more middle-class and leafy suburban setting that the Thamesmead of Beautiful Thing - and indeed what may ensue by trying to overcome them. Matters develop when he falls for the school's head boy, the popular and sporty John Dixon Brad Gorton and what develops between them is a mixture of ups and downs, and their romance is explored sensitively and cleverly. Both actors give very natural performances we presume John less sure of himself and his sexuality, but Steven doesn't have all the answers for him, or for himself.  Did any of us as teenagers, despite the bravado we may have used to hide the truth?? The school environment of parent and peer-presure, the threat of homophobic bullying, and the cringe-inducing school disco were they really that bad? Alas, I fear, yes....are all reproduced on screen.  Perhaps the bullies seem at first stereotypically thuggish, but the audience is made aware that they are part of the in-crowd, and best mates of the said head boy. Get Real is both heart wrenchingly touching and pleasantly funny with a little touch of teenage crassness and there are some great exchanges between Steven and his next door neighbour and best friend Linda Charlotte Brittain who has her own bit of trouble with men and cars. The message of Don't Get Angry - Get Real is brought home at the end, with the School Prize-giving, when Steven's acceptance speech is not quite the one people - or indeed I think Steven - expected to give.  It is the sort of speech I and I bet a lot of other people would have loved to make at school, but didn't have the guts.  Perhaps some of you reading this review already have. If the ending is ambiguous towards optimistic, and perhaps a little too tidy for some people, it can be forgiven as Get Real II hasn't appeared and I hate too many loose ends and it doesn't detract from the rest of the film, being quite realistic in the scheme of things.

Secondary schools of any type are big boxes where there are plenty of closets and they tie up and throw those they don't like in those closets for them to rot, to cry, to suffer, to be miserable. Don't believe one moment it is only a question of sexual orientation. It can be the way you dress, the music you listen to, or even for teachers the way you speak to the students or the way you may put your hand on the students' shoulders.This film is perfect and so British indeed. It touches the right points and it plucks the right strings. How can a 16 year old young man, or boy if you prefer, come out of the closet and just trust himself, trust his family, trust his school, trust the world even, and know he will be accepted the way he is and the way he feels happy? That's the worst part of it. Of course the parents know there is something bothering the boy, or the young man if you prefer. Of course the teachers feel it too and even know it. The other students just feel it, decide that it is what they feel it is, and most of them, at least most of those who will say anything, will condemn the young man, or the boy if you prefer. And don't even imagine it is not the same thing for girls, or young women if you prefer.But at the same time the only way to get out of the closet is to open the door with a bang and to let everyone know that from now on they better not walk on the boy's, or the young man's if you prefer, prick and even raise one single finger to block the way, otherwise their cubes as they say in CSI will be mashed to a pulp. It takes crazy courage for the first one. It takes courage for the one hundred next ones and when you reach one thousand you can finally start finding it nearly natural. But it will be natural only when you reach the million of out-of-the-closet-tall-walkers. And tall you need to walk.I regret that this simple question of the freedom to love who you want to love and who wants to love you back, no matter who that one is has become a religious question, a political question, a philosophical question, or whatever other label you can put on that. It is none of these and it is no other classification you may invent. It is only a question of sentiments, feelings, emotions, passions, empathy and liberty. It is a basic human right. Everyone has the right to love everyone else who accepts that love and loves them back.I have been dealing with men, or women, in the closet, no matter what closet it may be, all my life. Some of my university professor colleagues told me I was not supposed to know who is Jewish, who is Moslem, who is LGBT, or whatever, and that the students are not supposed to tell. Some professors are still living on the don't ask don't tell syndrome, you know that cowardly compromise Bill Clinton invented to make everyone forget what was happening at the time in the Oval Office.And now this DADT shameful legislation has been dropped all the fundamentalist brains in the world consider marriage is for sex and sex is for procreation, and that there is no other dimension in sex and in marriage. As you can see love has disappeared for these brains that are indeed no brains. You make love but you do not love. For them everyone on this planet, and sooner or later they are going to extend this silly ideology to the moon or to mars, has to wear the only penguin costume that is allowed by the necessity to make spermatozoa and eggs meet and fertilize each other. If you use a French letter, not to say a condom, a pill of any sort, a diaphragm or, horrible horror of horrors, vanity of vanities, an abortion you become a killer, a murderer, an assassin, some one who should be stoned on market day on the market square in every village or neighbourhood in the world.Yeah it is nothing but love and love is a passion, an emotion, a feeling, a sentiment, something that makes your mind rev up and then take off at cosmic speed and in that phenomenal power and force there might be for some a sexual dimension but there is no obligation for that dimension to exist and be experienced by all the people who are in love, who love one another. To make love is not even a plus. It is another dimension because then you lose your head, you loosen your mind and you blaze your soul tracks to let your hormones take over and your endocrine glands, you may chose the one you prefer, empty themselves.Actually it seems to be a syndrome that concerns the fundamentalists because for them love cannot exist outside the only sexual relation they accept &#x96; read my lips even if my mouth is full &#x96; and anything that is pricking outside and on the side of this square definition makes them retch the poor darlings, my heart is bleeding for them, and I applaud all those who make them vomit proving that for them it is always a question of emptying the endocrine glands, but in their case the wrong ones and the wrong way.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU "},{"Title":"Warm Hearted Coming of Age / Out Tale - Spoiler Warning","Date":"12 July 2004","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  Spoiler Warning!

As the story progresses it takes the road less traveled and keeps you on your toes, avoiding easy plot turns and trite answers.  Beautifully cast, the film's stars are appealing, attractive, and refreshingly honest in their portrayals.  Ben Silverstone plays Steve with a shyness and humor that reflects youth today. Brad Gorton as John, the hotter than hot jock boyfriend, is touching and realistic in his confusion and his alternating love for and mis-treatment of Steve. Turning in a wonderful performance as the cuddly Linda, Steve's best friend, is Charlotte Britain.  The rest of the supporting cast shine as well.  Beautifully photographed and expertly directed, this film sparkles and is one of the best gay-themed films I have ever seen. While it doesn't end the way I would like it to, it does stay true to itself and ends as it should...heatbreakingly uplifting and most importantly...true to life. In my ranking of the top 5 gay-themed films, Get Real comes in at #3.1.) Lilies     2.) My Beautiful Laundrette 3.) Get Real   4.) Beautiful Thing    5.)

But the  movie is so good that it functions very well on its own.There are some really interesting twists in the story I was not expecting that the man who exited the public  washroom to be picked up by the main character would be the best looking guy in the school that every girl desired. The performances are wonderful. Ben Silverstone as Steven Carter does an extraordinary and believable job as a young man  comfortable with his sexual preference. He manages to create a great relationship between him and John, the  object of his affection (who said geeks were boring). His speech in front of the entire school is heartbreaking.  Brad Gorton as John Dixon is a real surprise. Most handsome actors have only their looks to show on the screen. He has  genuine talent. He creates a deliciously confused young man about his sexuality. His character could have every girl yet  he wants Steven. Another good choice as an actress is Charlotte Brittain as Steven's best friend. She is truly compassionate and is not afraid to speak her mind. What else can I say? I felt sorry for John in the end, because he was a coward. But I felt good because Steven had now the support of newly formed friends (including the girl who wanted him as a boyfriend) and of his parents. Bravo!  10/10       "},{"Title":"Some hilarious moments, but...","Date":"3 June 1999","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  I would have enjoyed this movie much more had I not had Beautiful Thing to compare it to.  While entertaining at times and with some truly funny situations, it falls short in many respects.  The acting seems to suffer as the hunk just isn't believable in some key scenes.  And can anyone make a movie without using most or all of the stereotypes?  The character who's comfortable being gay is not athletic and gets beat up.  The character who doesn't want to be gay is athletic and snubs his gay lover.  The girl next door is overweight, wears too much makeup and is dramatic, so of course she is the gay guy's best friend.  C'mon, can't we be a little more realistic. I'm giving this movie high marks for being what it is, but it could have been so much more.  I think I'll watch Beautiful Thing again.

But it still works wonderfully on its own terms.The movie is well-acted by the whole cast and the story is realistic (unfortunately) and true to life.  Some people have complained that the interactions between the two boys keep running hot and cold way too often. Well welcome to real life!  I know of similar situations with friends and this movie captured them perfectly.  Also the isolation and longing of the gay boy was so accurate.  There's a sequence at a dance when the two boys are staring longingly at each other while dancing with two women they couldn't care less about.  That scene brought tears to my eyes!  Also when the gay teen tells off the guy he's in love with and the closing scene (don't want to give it away) were also extremely powerful and honest.  The film also ends realistically BUT not depressingly.  Also, the film IS funny.  It's not a comedy, but it does have its light moments.  See it! It's well worth 8 or 9 bucks.

The characters were well thought about and played with charm. At no point was it a in your face film and thought about its subject with a fresh and likeable understanding. My one disappointment was the thought that the only way for young gay people was to find each other was to go to the toilets or woods, Or that all gay people want is sex Come on lets get a bit more original on that one.

Actually Beautiful Thing had some cheesy acting and some dull moments; hey guys remember Wild Reeds hu?, that was a coming of age movie too, close to the same plot line as Get Real. Get Real was well directed, very good acting and script adaptation from a play. With some twisted moments and I'm sure that people, especially gay dudes, will find themselves relating and empathizing with the main character; a totally  big + in a movie. But, Get Real had a few faults as well. Some of the scores were too contrived, the scene when they were slow dancing and You are so beautiful to me song plays;  Aretha Franklin singing the words freedom after the coming out scenario, etc. I'm putting myself in the jock's place, and no way this dude will go for a 100 pound, pale, goofy gay guy; another thing is would you cruise a public bathroom for a quickie leaving your private school uniform on? If you want to be so discreet about your sexual preferences, hey get your butt across town, or if you are so in love with the good looking jock, man, you would do anything to keep the relationship. Some of the scenes contradict themselves in such obvious ways that through the flick you find yourself asking, what is going on?  However, Get Real with all it's faults, saves itself because it gives you good insight of how others feel being alianated, estranged and how to deal with society for being themselves. A good moral in the end; an all around feel good scene; reminds me of SLC PUNK, which I found myself totally relating to.

Overall it was a pleasure but the ending didn't live up to the potential of the rest of the movie.  The last 15~20 minutes of the film just fell apart or rather wandered around until you just wished it would be over for the characters.  The acting and casting were great but its a film that will not leave you feeling the same way Beautiful Thing did.   It's a should see film but not one that would draw me back to see again in the theaters. Although I'll probably buy the video if/when it is available.

(Ah, if only.)  -Sure, they're both typically randy seventeen-year-olds; but we're told that THIS relationship, unlike Steven's furtive sexual encounters and John's mechanical fling with an underwear model, is special.  Really?  I would have liked to have SEEN the relationship - the actual, first-order relationship, not just John and Steven's second-order talk about it.This brings me to the main reason I found Get Real hard to enjoy it seems to consist entirely of painfully protracted, hesitant, fumbling, conversations in which neither side has any idea what he or she wants to talk about.  When Steven first meets John - when he first meets ANYONE - it seems that all he can do is um and ah and look at the ground.  -Realistic? Perhaps, but it just goes to show how little realism is worth, if it means we have to sit through one slow, awkward scene after another for 110 minutes.  For this reason I wasn't so bothered by the speech at the end. That was awkward, too; but at least it showed that Steven had managed to string words together into coherent and reasonably fluent paragraphs. About time.I'm reminded of the (few) films I've seen about the social ostracising of gays, like The Sum of Us and Boys Don't Cry; they, too, have colourless, under-defined central characters and relationships.  If the central romance is heterosexual, writers feel the need to create some kind of special something to make it interesting to outsiders; if it's homosexual, that fact alone is felt to be enough.  -This is less true of the romance in Boys Don't Cry.  But then, that relationship isn't really gay.P.S.  If Get Real is a bit better than I've made it sound, it's because of the female characters.

Every word, plot developement and camera angle whiffs of cheese and sterotyping. Predictability doesn't cover the staggering obviousness of this movie. The dialog sounds like it was written by a monkey with a green felt tip pen, and the cast acts accordingly. Melodramatic and self-indulgent, this movie creates a world that revolves around the self-absorbed main character as he flounces around on the screen with the righteous indignation of every hormonal 15 year old- gay or straight. Quite why anyone would watch this- unless they were laughing at it, not with it- is beyond me; it is similar to the drivel that can be found in any teenagers diary Full of moping about and exclamations that 'nobody understands me'.  It is almost painful to watch, such is it's cringeworthyness.  Just as Steven's class mates should 'Get Real',Steven himself should get over it and watch 'queer as folk'. This is the kind of movie that perpetuates the images and fears of homosexuality- written by a bygone age and easily dated. "},{"Title":"Get Real?
