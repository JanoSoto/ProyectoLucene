But I've grown very tired of violent conflict portrayed as easy, fun, moral, and without risk. This is a movie where all the violence is fearsome, difficult, and wholly unpleasant. As it should be, anything else really is dishonest and evil. This is one reason i think most people don't like this movie. There are two more. One is a somewhat complicated plot. There are about a dozen characters and each one have different motives and I think most people can handle no more than 4 motives. The other reason is that the main characters are not the heroes of the story. They set the story in motion and keep it together but they are not who the movie is about and to tell a story in such an unconventionally roundabout way is entirely confusing for some people.So you may not like this movie if...You are uncomfortable with violence being violent,You can't keep track of the motivations of 8 separate characters,You automatically believe that the story is about the characters played by the actors pictured largest on the box.otherwise you may really like this movie because it's really well made in all its aspects.

My girlfriend and I stood confused as the music built up and built up, then finally climaxed. Didn't make a bit of sense to either of us.With that said- I thought this movie was outstanding. Benicio Del Toro has this presence about him that radiates coolness, and Ryan Phillippe did a remarkable job as well with his role. There were scenes in which hardly any dialogue was spoken, yet whole paragraphs were spoken through facial expressions. Thats a testament to the abilities of the actors right there. The double meaning of the game of hearts explanation was fascinating and fun to decipher.Plots twists galore, not a single one of them predictable. The terminology was all new to me (i.e. bagman/dejudication I think it was...) and it made me feel like I was actually participating in the movie.This is a thinkers movie, and some people may not be in the mood for that.

More than enough rich dialogue and pinpoint camera angle set ups to go around with some live wire moments of unexpected turnarounds, double crosses and shoot outs may be the film's only fault in being an excess of too much of a good thing. A roundelette of pulp fiction best served by its exciting cast (as a side note, del Toro reminded me for some reason as a young Robert Mitchum in some scenes; go figure) and a filmmaker to watch.

But I think comparing that movie to 'The Way Of The Gun' (Christopher McQuarrie wrote both and directs this in an impressive debut) is unproductive and misguided. Both movies feature criminal anti-heroes and tricky plot twists, but in different ways, and are very different in approach and theme. McQuarrie isn't repeating himself here, this is something new. Something that has more in common with Sam Peckinpah than the plethora of shallow post-Tarantino rip-offs Hollywood has foisted on us in recent years.The basic premise is fairly straightforward - two losers Parker (A surprisingly effective Ryan Phillipe in easily his best role to date) and Longbaugh (the always excellent Benicio Del Toro), cook up a half baked scheme to kidnap a surrogate mother (Juliette Lewis - 'Cape Fear', 'Kalifornia') and hold her for ransom. Little do they realize that she is carrying a child for Chidduck,  a Mob money launderer (veteran character actor Scott Wilson - 'In Cold Blood', 'The Ninth Configuration') who has some nasty associates, and is reluctant to pay up.The guys soon find themselves embroiled in a chinese puzzle of relationships including ruthless bodyguards Jeffers (Taye Digs - 'Go') and Obecks (Nicky Katt - 'SubUrbia', 'The Limey'), and Chidduck's bagman and troubleshooter, the complex Sarno (the legendary James Caan - 'The Godfather', 'Thief'), and Sarno's colleague Abner (frequent Clint Eastwood sidekick, and Juliet's real life father, Geoffrey Lewis).   To reveal what happens would be to ruin this wonderful movie. 'The Way Of The Gun' isn't a stupid popcorn action flick. It requires thought and attention to fully appreciate, and that fact, along with the lack of heroes, and the matter of fact violence, seems to have turned many people off. But in my opinion it is just those factors that will make this, like 'The Usual Suspects', a movie that will stand the test of time. Along with 'Chopper', the movie that has impressed the most so far this decade. Don't miss either one!

The philosophical/amoral central team...  could've been Pulp Fiction redux.  The wise older criminal sharing his wisdom with those below him...  If I really went into all the elements of this movie that could've been handled as shameless rip offs of other films, that list alone would take me over 1,000 words.The brilliance of this film is that MacQuarrie, impressively directing for the first time from his own script, takes familiar elements, tired cliches, and breaths new, inventive life into them.  This is a neat hat trick, and not an easy one.  Godard did it with HIS first film, Breathless.  Tarantino did it with Pulp Fiction.  And MacQuarrie does it here.  Note that the aforementioned instance is the only place where you will hear a mention of Tarantino similarities in this review.  Those who would criticize Way of the Gun as being derivative of Taranton's film are missing the point and not really watching the film.This film reflects an utter familiarity with the conventions of CINEMA.  Of the things that go into a great film.  Knowing those thigns so well, as Godard did, allows MacQuarrie to become freed enough to work with them, change them,  and make them become something knew.

I think it may be the purest form of a perfect action drama. McQ makes the world its set even more realistic by making you quite unsure who the good guys are...in actuality there really aren't any...everyone here has done something unscrupulous at one time or another...the only ones who have embraced their bad are the two characters we follow Parker and Longbaugh(brilliantly remade characters based on Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid). McQ makes us see the story through their eyes(Mainly Parkers played by Ryan Phillippe) They are both Butch and Sundance in a more real underplayed way.But they don't fool themselves about who they are and trick you into believing they are someone else(Good or holsom). They are the perfect guides into this world of shadiness, lies on top of lies and secrets. Lucus used the same technique in Star Wars A New Hope by having a story take place through the eyes of two inconsequential characters(R2 D2 and C3PO). A trick he picked up from the great Akira Kirowsawa. SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILERThe story of a woman becoming a surrogate mother for money to help out her aging criminal father(THE BAGMAN) and in turn finding love from the son of the very same man paying her is like...whew! It could be easily told through the eyes of the daughter or the doctor(Who McQ has said is the real hero of the story). But we see it through Benicio and Ryan. And its great.Their chemistry is terrific. Their almost secret way of communication through glances, cryptic phrases and extreme situational teaching(Mainly Longbaugh teaching Parker never to trust anybody by setting Parker up to get killed a couple timesGUN IN DOCTOR PAINTER'S BAG & SHOTGUN IN THE HOTEL ROOM) They know each other so well they don't even have to say anything. That comes across on screen. Benicio Del Torro owns his role and plays it so low key. There are scenes where he says nothing at all and conveys any and every emotion. This is one of Phillipe's better films, a best personally seeing as I wasn't a fan before this. After which case I was on a soap box shouting that he would have been great as Anakin Skywalker in the Star Wars prequels. James Caan is....James Caan...in a role I think must have been written for him...cool aging badass. Taye Diggs...though I hate him...is great in the film because this is one of the only times he doesn't play Taye Diggs. He turns his warm sex symbol persona on its ear by playing a man of real menace in apathy. And for those who have read long enough about me droning on about this films hidden dramatic elements...the action scenes are great. Some of the most realistic gunfights I have ever scene. Actors were all Navy Seal trained and took it almost too seriously.(Listen to the DVD commentary when McQ talks about Taye Diggs persistent on how he run down an alley with a shotgun in the correct hand or how the actors never put their finger on the trigger unless they were shooting.) The final gun battle goes down for me as one the greatest of all time set eerily in similar surroundings as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid I dare you to find a better shoot out.McQ and a Mr Tarantino fella are how got into writing. And McQ has some of the funniest and cool-as-hell one liners in this flick. Almost better than his previous film Usual Suspects.

Whilst that is all well and good, most people eventually find themselves wanting...more. That little bit extra to garnish an already tasty dish. Here, Christopher McQuarrie presents a whole lotta extra treats, whilst never losing his grip upon tension or bloody spectacle. Rambo-lovers, however, should best stay clear, for this is undoubtedly a Thinking man's shoot 'em up. When,as an example, did the hero confess to feeling guilt over murdering a paedophile? Conduct torture purely for cash? Get royally shafted in what we assumed would be an all-out celebration of hip carnage? Bear in mind that this was 200, a whole year before Spider-Man told folk that it's ok to cry whilst kicking the sh*t out of somebody. Brave stuff. Were this all that Chris provided in the way of innovation, it'd still be mightily impressive, yet he also shows some serious balls within structural limits. As opposed to having bullet dance/chat/explosion/one-liner, he allows moments to build, ebbing, flowing, surely swelling into one large tidal wave of carnage. By the time blood begins to shed, an audience is engaged with two low-life antiheros, whilst sympathising with their-refreshingly scarred-nemesis. It's truly remarkable to see well-choreographed brutality mixing delicately with excellent performances, there's that constant Yes, i GET you! feeling beneath every frame.

The big moment of illumination in this movie comes at the end. These master-less samurai are touched by the most basic human appeal to decency the helplessness of the woman and child. There is a point where they make the move. You can see them deciding that they are switching sides -- no longer serving themselves but something more worthy protecting the innocent. At that moment they become true warriors again, which is probably what they first aspired to be before falling into crime.I love that all this is conveyed without so much direct talk.

It tells of two small time crooks, played by Ryan Phillippe and Benicio Del Toro, who get entangled in a game of crooks versus crooks when they try to pull of a kidnapping.Dreaming of bigger things in life, but regardless of the method used to achieve their dreams of riches, they overhear a conversation at a sperm bank clinic (one of the most happening dialogues in the movie happens there) about a surrogate mother bearing the child of some rich family. They decide to kidnap the lady, played by Juliette Lewis, and hold the mother and child hostage.However, they embroil themselves into a bigger web of intrigue, as every character, from the mother, the husband and wife who employed her, the doctor, the bodyguards, to the bagmen, all have their own agenda, and the relationships between one another must be one of the most complex written for the screen in recent times. Everything is more than meets the eye, and betrayals and double crossings are the agenda for the day.The pacing is well measured, and there are moments of suspense masterfully injected at points in the movie. I like the initial hostage taking scene, where the sudden shift of focus and introduction of complexity catches our two anti-heroes Longbaugh (Del Toro) and Parker (Phillippe) completely off guard. The car chase and pursuit is also one of the more innovative and quirky scenes in the movie, one which Del Toro actually suggested, and got it made on screen. You have to watch it to believe.The finale gives a kick to western shoot-em-up fans, as Longbaugh and Parker go head to head with everyone in a Mexican brothel, using modern day weapons of shotguns and handguns. Thrown into the mix is veteran James Caan, as a bag-man extraordinaire, having been so long in the business because of his experience in staying alive.Del Toro and Phillippe exude an excellent bond of camaraderie between their characters - they trust nobody except for themselves, while I thought Juliette Lewis was terrific in her role as the very pregnant mother caught between both sides, and yet bringing out strength as she fights for her child's and her own survival, taking her interests in her own hands.It's a good mix of action and workout for your brain as you figure out the relationships between the characters as the narrative moves along. Suited for those mundane afternoons in which you want to break out from.No special additions in this Code 1 DVD. "},{"Title":"Well... It's Not Bad","Date":"6 February 2007","Score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" Opening with intrusive, loud music and grabbing your attention straight away Way Of The Gun is definitely a movie that intends to hold your concentration and not let go of it no matter what you might do to try and wriggle free. Not that I did much wiggling, I rarely do these days, must be something to do with my hips.Starting with our two leads Parker (Ryan Phillippe) and Longbaugh (Benicio Del Toro) (if ever the term anti-hero was to apply to anyone it's them), we straight away realise that neither of these men really care about much in general. We're able to guess this by the way that one punches a woman in the face and head a couple of times, though really she did deserve it, and the other decided to kiss a perfect stranger, before stamping hard on her foot when she let him know just how much she didn't enjoy being kissed. This odd attitude is further re-enforced by the voice-over where we learn that while leads Parker and Longbaugh may believe in some kind of destiny, they have no intention of letting it rule their life. So we find ourselves, as so often we do in these situations, at a sperm bank. Here the pair overhear a doctor talking about a surrogate mother who is working for a very rich couple, and so a fiendish kidnapping plan is made.What follows is a shoot-out you don't see and a high-speed car chase involving very slow moving cars. The car chase itself is a particular highlight for me. Still, once they have the kidnapped girl, Parker and Longbaugh quickly realise that they are in way over their heads. It appears that when kidnapping it's sometimes a good idea to find out who you are kidnapping from. Our two anti-heroes are not going to give up, culminating in a particularly slick final shootout. For those of you who may have noticed, the names Parker and Longbaugh are actually the real names of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Hands up anyone who thinks their final stand is going to go well? Coming from the very complicated shaped pen of Christopher McQuarrie, writer of The Usual Suspects we can obviously expect plot twists and turns that will very quickly have us dazed and confused. In ancient Greece it was believed that the sun obviously goes around the earth. Assumptions can be wrong. Apart from one 'surprise' that wasn't all that surprising and a bombshell at the end that, while unexpected also wasn't all that explosive. Having now gained the enmity of McQuarrie for all eternity can I also say that the script itself is well written. The dialogue, while not realistic, is very well written and believable and each of the characters have something about them that we latch onto.But of course writing isn't anything without decent performances to bring it out. Toro and Phillippe are both very, very cool and slick, despite the fact that they are also portrayed as being inept criminals, (two aspects that I didn't find gelled so well). Taye Diggs and Nicky Katt as the bodyguards/general mooks Jeffers and Obecks get to look very good throughout the movie, Diggs especially impressing with his double-crossing villain. However the two stand out performances come from James Caan and Geoffrey Lewis. Both of these men give fantastically understated performances, with their final scene together in the car being at once very poignant and close to hysterical. They both have a world-weariness about them that is a fitting counter-point to the slick and stylish actions of the world around them. Caan is obviously reluctant to kill the two men he has been sent to deal with, indeed he clearly likes them far more than the people he is being forced to work with.I do need to make a special mention of the action sequences. The way that the actors move with and handle their guns just feels right. Apart from a couple of insane shots with a pistol the gunplay is very realistic and heightens the feeling of tension and danger throughout the movie.This is a movie that tries to balance comedy, action and thriller elements. For the most part I think it manages admirably and is generally worth watching. This is definitely one that I enjoyed more halfway through once a friend had arrived and started watching it with me. Now and then you want to be able to grin at a friend and just nod, acknowledging that something you just watched was very cool, gruesome or cool and gruesome.

It's INTENSE. It's DARK. There's not a single character in the movie who's likable, and some viewers attack that like it's a bad thing. The story line is complex, the relationships between the numerous characters are subtle and nuanced; and still, some viewers attack that like that's a bad thing.Just because a viewer doesn't understand something, doesn't make the film bad. It's a difference of opinion, absolutely, but that doesn't make The Way of the Gun a bad film. Au contraire, this is a very smart film... and when a filmmaker is making a smart film about amoral, gun-toting outlaws, the people who come to see that sort of movie are going to feel confused and angry. Because they wanted it to be simple. They wanted easy answers, a clear-cut good guy and bad guy, and a happy ending. The way movies have gone since film noir faded away, decades ago.But this film is not so simple, and neither are the characters within it, nor is the plot. Chris McQuarrie refuses to write something so cut-and-dry, so black-and-white. It's taut, it's tight, it rides a bad vibe from the opening sequence all the way down to the last line. This film is so gritty it makes me feel dirty after watching it... McQuarrie may be a victim of his own success, because it was released in the aftermath of The Usual Suspects, but if it built up an underground following like The Killer, it would be on the shelf of must-haves next to John Woo, Guy Ritchie and any other art film your parents wouldn't approve of.Every character has his own motive, has his own backstory, and not all are necessarily spelled out for you. The dialogue is wound so tight, it snaps Fifteen million dollars is not money. It's a motive, with a universal adapter on it.I own this movie, and on a dark, rainy afternoon, I'll whip it out on the unsuspecting guest... It's from the writer of 'The Usual Suspects' I tell them.

I hated I Know What You Did Last Summer, he struck me as totally pretentious in the otherwise entertaining Cruel Intentions, and I have yet to watch Little Boy Blue, but needless to say, my expectations are fairly low. I decided to take the time to watch The Way of the Gun mainly because I thought the preview looked good (thanks, in no small part, to Benecio Del Toro), and I loved every second of it. I've heard some slightly negative things about it, but on the other hand, I've also seen professional film critics give Fight Club the lowest rating possible, proving that some critics just can't be trusted. The Way of the Gun is just about as good as a crime thriller can get.There wasn't a whole lot of competition, but Benecio Del Toro stole the show, hands down. He delivered one of the most entertaining and quality performances that I've seen in years. Juliette Lewis also did a great job in this film. Who would have expected that the woman who was Mallory Knox could so effectively portray a scared pregnant woman? Luckily, she was able to let her wild side a little loose near the end during the birthing process, when she reminded us of the size of her mouth and the sheer strength of her voice! James Caan seemed to have been a bit exploited in his role as a `bag man,' but he still filled the role very effectively.The beginning of the film, where we are introduced to Mr. Longbaugh (Del Toro) and Parker (Philippe), is probably one of the best parts of the film. Not only the hilarious fight scene at the nightclub, but also the next few scenes, particularly the interviews for the semen donations (`No one's ever mentioned sex with dead people!' `Did you ever ask?' `No!' `You should&#133;').(spoilers) One of the main things that made The Way of the Gun such a great movie was that there was just so much going on. The plot is so complex and the presentation of the film is so entertaining that it invites and almost requires more than one viewing. Besides that, the movie also contains what is, in my opinion, one of the best car chases ever filmed. Sure it's slow at times, but there was actually TECHNIQUE. There was little to no destruction done in that particular scene (something that is generally mandatory for a car chase to be effective), but it was so well executed that none was needed. The vast majority of high-speed chases seen in movies are pretty much the same &#150; reckless, fast, destructive, and generally thoughtless. Look, for example, at the stereotypical car chases in The Rock, Gone In 60 Seconds, and, in an extreme case, Blues Brothers 2000.  In The Way of the Gun, one of the things that Mr. Longbaugh and Parker did was they stopped their truck and got out, letting it roll, so that their pursuers would get out of their car and follow. As the truck rolled along, they all followed, engaging in a very effective gun fight, and then when some distance had been covered, Longbaugh and Parker would jump back into the truck and take off, gaining a significant lead as their pursuers run back to their own car, which had been left behind during the gunfight. This may not have the destructive satisfaction of many other chases, but it was by far more realistic, which is another quality that this film possesses. Immediately following that chase, Longbaugh goes to steal another car so that they can ditch the truck, and he hits the window (painfully, from the looks of it) with his elbow three times before it breaks. There's no reason to do something like that in a movie other than to make it more realistic, and the more realistic a movie is, the better, particularly when it is unnecessary for it to be unrealistic.The kidnap plot that drives the film is also very unique and well presented. Juliette Lewis plays a woman who has been hired by a wealthy couple as a surrogate mother. Therefore, the child that she is carrying is extremely valuable, so Longbaugh and Parker kidnap her (and the child) in hopes of getting their hands on the money. This story is done very well, and it just gets better and more complicated from there. There are so many things about this movie that are totally original, too, right down to the sound of the gunshots. Also, there are interesting and unique scenes. For example, there is one scene where Longbaugh walks into a convenience store and proceeds to help himself to various items, making little effort to keep the female clerk from noticing. After a cut away to Parker in the van with Robin (Juliette Lewis), we go back inside, and Longbaugh and this girl behind the counter are smoking cigarettes and watching the ultrasound tape of the kidnapped baby. Did he just charm this girl into letting him smoke in the store while he used her VCR? Did she not care that he had been stealing from the store? As far as the rest of the film, this particular scene did not require any explanation, and therefore none was given. Normally, this would be a problem, but the rest of the movie works so well that these things don't really matter. The Way of the Gun is what you get when you take an overblown action crime thriller and add a bit of realism to it. The final gunfight sequence is extremely well done, and it ends the film very ambiguously but also in a very entertaining way. The Way of the Gun is a great film, with good acting and directing, as well as a brilliant script. See it.

Bloated and pretentious, it is like an oversized car that grinds to a halt, spurting occasionally into movement.  Though humourless and cynical, it is an epic farce; epic because of the Western backdrop against which it is played; farce, because the whole project seems ready to collapse under its own earnestness, characters come and go unexpectedly, there's a lot of going in and out of doorways, the action shifts between distances thousands of miles apart, and yet the same characters seem to recongregate, as if some great big hand is moving the delf along a table.  I'm not able to tell whether 'Way of the Gun' is absurdly complex or foolishly simple.  The major problem is the screenplay, which seems desperate to remind us of the plot's metaphysical depth, when, as Keaton and Melville have taught us, action is eloquent enough on its own. Some have seen the film as a denunciation of violent cinema, cool macho gangster nihilism, as the sterile, masturbatory crooks (the chief of whom can't even have a baby with his wife) is contrasted with the simple values of maternity and fertility - when the enviably calm 'bagman' Joe Sarno walks in on Robin in labour, he seems momentarily struck with awe.  He is the only character at the end not tainted by blood - after all, he is the cleaner - and McQuarrie doesn't seem to be making much distinction between the blood of a bursting mother and the wounds of a bunch of gunmen.If the screenplay never transcends its own gaze, we can always concentrate of McQuarrie's directorial style.  Some have compared the film to 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' (the narrator gives himself and his accomplice the real-life surnames of the outlaws), but 'The Wild Bunch' is as good a starting point as any - the alternation of thunderous gunfights with an unearthly calm; the dead-end masculinity; the ritual finale (when Parker jumps into the dry fountain full of broken beer bottles - ouch!); the rare feel for landscape and architecture.  The long central sequence in Mexico, where the plot overload seems to stand still, is a familiar Peckinpah device, as the men rejuvenate, take stock, reflect, although actual Mexicans are conspicuously sparse.  Peckinpah was very much influenced by 'The Treasure of Sierra Madre', and like most Huston films, 'Way' is a hymn to failure.  What's surprising, though, for such a self-regarding wordsmith, is what a great action director McQuarrie is.  The gunfights here are truly visceral, very 1970s, exciting and full of crackling guns, the best since 'Heat', and showing most Hollywood action thrillers up for the cartoons they are.  The opening fight outside the concert is like a diabolic inversion of 'Grease', while the 'Battleship Potemkin' parody getaway with the pregnant Robin is extraordinary.  As is the way the cold modernist sheen a la 'Claire Dolan' gives onto the old-fashioned dustiness of a Western.  The music is terrific too, alternating melodramatic squalls of 'Usual Suspects'-like dread, with thrilling castanetas, as if the whole film is just one big corrida.

She gets punched in the face and it's shockingly funny. I wish the rest of this is just as good. Writer/director Christopher McQuarrie has created something that is a little bit off. It's pulpy but it's way too much of a mess. It has a bit of action, but there are long stretches of boring inaction . It tries to be 'Pulp Fiction' but he ain't no Tarantino. But then who is? The dialog is stiff. Overall there is no likable character anywhere, not even Robin. There is no rooting interest. It is stretched out far too much after an interesting kidnapping start. McQuarrie is trying to do his own movie after the success of writing 'The Usual Suspects'. It shows some promise with some unusual touches. However this is a near miss overall.

Two robbers and murderers kidnap a pregnant girl, not knowing that she's carrying a baby for gangster Scott Wilson. Wilson has two bodyguards in the act plus two button men/bagmen played by James Caan and Geoffrey Lewis, who is introduced playing Russian roulette on himself with about six pistols.The story is fleshed out with a variety of subplots and machinations. It's neo-noir in nature. One does not know whom to root for! I guess one can root for Juliette Lewis to have her baby intact, and she looks terribly uncomfortable throughout. And who wouldn't be in her condition? The film itself is attractively filmed and has some well-staged shootouts and action scenes. The acting is good. Del Toro need only look. Philippe can act although he does come across as stuck on himself and not really the person he's portraying. In this movie, he holds the guns well. He sounds as if he has a mouth full of marbles, however. Juliette outdoes herself. She sure can scream, or was that a voice double? Old pros Geoffrey Lewis and James Caan have no problem, apart from a script problem here and there that they cannot overcome. The movie has a small amount of cryptic lines that don't quite register. Maybe on second viewing they will, for this is a movie one can watch over again.The main downside of the movie is a certain amount of pretentiousness. I give them credit for trying to deepen the story with the talk about prayer, God and redemption. It didn't click, however. The burden fell mainly on Philippe for that, and it didn't sound natural. The effect of the baby on these hit men didn't quite ring true either, and that was a script/direction issue. It wasn't prepared for well enough, so that when these feelings were expressed we'd feel it natural. Instead it seemed grafted on. After all, they kidnapped a pregnant woman in the first place. The camaraderie between Del Toro and Caan also didn't seem natural; it was overdone.With no hero available, the writer had to go somewhere with this story to get a resolution. And the direction he tried was OK. He just didn't pull it off. To prepare for the eventual expression of feelings by all these guys, the script needed earlier scenes to lead the way. The Asphalt Jungle is a role model in how to do this. For example, Sterling Hayden is a gunman but in an early scene with Marc Lawrence, we see that Hayden has a sense of independence and won't be boned.So basically we have a high order of technical skill and filming here and decent enough acting, but a script that falls short of its potential.

This is nice. This is a good thing. But is the movie a good thing? Yeah, I guess it is.Plot wise - I liked the plot here. It's initially a simple premise. Two rogue-wanders are travelling around - they're Benico del Tero (as Longbaugh) and Ryan Phillipe (as Parker). They overhear the arrival of a rich business-man's doctor, while at a clinic, and decide to kidnap her, which they do. The trouble is they picked the wrong man to mess with and everyone - from the business man's bodyguards to the daughter herself to her lover - has an idea about how to handle the situation. There's crossing, and double crossing, and a nice big shoot out to satisfy one and all.I like Del Toro. Some reviewers here accuse him of `sleeping' through his role here - I see this as him assuming the laid back, nonchalant posture of the rogue that he is. He has no cares in the world, he drifts from moment to moment, so why should he be playing a moody intense freak? Ryan Phillipe's character has a little more edge, playing the younger and less experienced companion of Del Toro. His good looks don't actually go against him and he's got enough talent  to play the rogue here with a touch of humanity ( a touch - not much more) underneath. Juliette Lewis, as the kidnap victim Robin, is her usual self - she's good if you like her in any other movie she played (somewhat shy, lacking self confidence, etc.). All the rest are good and have the right level of the indefinable `cool' that the film requires.What I liked here was how Director/Writer Christopher McQuarrie doesn't insult his audience by having everything explained in big bright neon lights. A motivation is explained in a line of dialogue. A family link is implied in a word and a glance. In reality people do not address the air in monologues to tell us their thoughts and McQuarrie lets us infer in the same manner that his characters must, as to what's going on and who is plotting what. He's also quite capable with his camera, considering this is his first directing role. The action scenes are quite tight and intense. There's also some remarkable originality in them - check out the first scene when Del Toro and Phillipe cover one another while making their escape, or the ingenious car chase moment just shortly afterwards. There's a feeling that McQuarrie put a good bit of time into researching how such events might really occur rather than just have the `John Woo' effect of back flipping in slow-motion with two guns in each hand. It works very well and adds to the `realism' of the movie.The movie is smart, it's clever, and well acted. And yet there's something not quite there. Is it the lack of an ultimate twist (the ending was quite clear to me)? Is it that, as subliminally as the plot develops, there's not quite enough of it? Is it that the characters, all well done, aren't quite interesting enough to make their fates worthy? Or does it deed some more wit or panache? Whatever it is, I can't quite grasp the flaw that would elevate this movie from a `should definitely give a look' to a `must see'.

To watch, its presentation, material, etc. This will be a much underrated film. Reasons Firstly the fact that no time is wasted, you need to concentrate for the whole thing. Much of the story is told in looks glances and connecting dots. So immediately you have lost 50% of your audience who will only concentrate for 10-15 mins, miss something and be lost for the rest of the film declaring it as pointless or confusing.If you can concentrate then the supposed plot twists are no more than just an intricate weaving of characters. You can work out from the start that everyone has their own agenda. The intelligent ones will play other people to get what they want and test each other. This also requires some nous from the viewer to see.Finally it is nice to have a movie with no good guys. Ooops, just lost another 20% of the public who can't handle a movie without a hero. It's also a movie with gunfights that are not set to a thumping soundtrack, reflecting the loud and very violent realism that are guns. And some great comedy touches striking that balance.On the acting side parts were played well, del Toro plays his intense twisted man beautifully, and Phillipe the slightly more innocent but really couldn't care less character also very well.The only thing I would criticize is the voice over at the end, it would have been nice to just drift away. It is worth noting that McQuarrie writes not to please the audience or make a successful film, but to challenge convention and show people a different side...This film will be fine craftsmanship to a narrow wedge of the audience, and a pleasure to watch. A large slice will find it acceptable and enjoy the acting, the gunfights or the intriguing plot. Leaving the final slice of audience to reel at the dead innocent public and be aggravated by the story they have to fill in, or the reason for such odd behaviour.

Gloriously free from self-referentiality, it is a rarity among films today in that it relies entirely on its ability to captivate the audience with the characters it creates and in telling a good story well.WOTG features the kind of intelligent, motive driven characters- who most importantly are never innately good or inherently evil- that haven't been seen since Tarantino nearly a decade earlier. Benicio Del Toro is once more a revelation, cementing his position as one of the hottest rising actors around, with a performance in which he manages to say everything, very often without saying anything. Even Phillipe is engaging in a role that subverts his typical 'pretty boy' roles. Kudos must go to him attempting to inject some variety and more unconventional work into his career. A note must also be made about the sublime veteran Caan. He simply oozes class and presence, reducing the likes of Taye Diggs and Nicky Katt to mere amateurs.The strength of this film lies in its writing and its criticisms of the conventions of 'buddy-action movies' and crime flicks. This is clear from the very opening of the film in which we see the two protagonists, clearly about to lose a fight, steal the glory of their opponents by attacking the women they are with the tone is set in which those you would normally root for will do things that both appal and intrigue. The plot is filled with these inventive subversions; including one of the greatest car chases I've seen, despite the fact that it occurs at a pace nothing shorter than walking speed.It is my belief that it is because of this sort of intelligence (it is never spelt out for the audience with a series of close-up shots and pointless dialogue what is going on)and the level of patience that is required to actually follow a story for 2-hours, that prevented WOTG from being a hit.I am not one of those sort of people who will write a review that says 'The Greatest Movie I've Ever Seen (Until The Next One Of Course)' and I shan't pretend that the film doesn't have holes in it characters such as the 'Bag man' played by Juliet Lewis' real life father are somewhat underdeveloped and the editing is occasionally erratic. But for those who are looking for a breath of fresh air and who do stick with what is ultimately a remarkable directorial debut from McQuarrie (he's even drawn comparisons with the likes of Peckinpah and Hawks) they will be rewarded.

Forgetting everything else that's brilliant about the film for a minute, the final shootout in the Mexican brothel is either the best or the second best shootout ever seen on screen (I can't decide between this and the one in Heat). It is everything a movie shootout should be - exciting AND realistic.Benicio Del Toro is incredible, just incredible. He speaks volumes without opening his mouth. Ryan Phillipe and Juliette Lewis are great as well.The musical score is staggering - absolutely appropriate, not wall to wall, but coming in for full effect at the right times. One example - when Juliette Lewis comes out of the motel room and gets her first breath of real freedom for a year, that is a very special moment, made even more special by the wonderful musical cue.The blurring of the line between 'Good and Bad guys' (©Hollywood 1920-present day) is something there should be more of in modern cinema. As people's behaviour is not black and white, neither should it be in films. As a result, you side with who you side with. Personally I think it adds a great depth to the film, as I side with everyone in the movie at some point. The film-makers do not try and force emotion in your face, they let you decide who you sympathise with (if anyone).The only criticism (and it should probably be aimed at my attention span rather than the film) is that the middle does drag on slightly during repeat viewings. I think this could be due to the fact that it happens mostly in long, lingering shots that go on for ever (a testament to the skill of the actors). Had it been cut a little quicker, I don't think it would be an issue. On the other hand, a snappier cutting style there might well ruin the flow of the movie - a difficult decision.Essential viewing - a fresh, original crime film that contains sincere character drama and superb action in (just about) the perfect amounts.

Certainly they're different types of films, but the similarities lie in their intelligence and their respective directors' evident love for movies. But I'd have to give the nod to WotG, simply because Christopher McQuarrie wrote and directed his own movie, whereas Soderbergh simply directed someone else's script (itself adapted from someone else's).If you didn't like this movie, I dare say it's because you were expecting another mindless American shoot-em-up. WotG is an atmosphere movie, a modern western, with unsympathetic and unrepentant characters who don't apologize for who they are or what they do. McQuarrie admirably does not tell us everything about his characters and their motivations, and that makes them all the more interesting. Parker and Longbaugh seem to know a lot about weapons and tactics, but we never get the typical Hollywood discussion about back when we were in the army, or on the force, etc. that a lesser writer would have included, or a less intelligent producer would have insisted on.Speaking of tactics, they were superb. A couple of minor technical glitches that most viewers won't notice, but all in all some very convincing (and realistic) action--and the antithesis of Charlie's Angels-type fantasy action. Characters load weapons, and reload, and reload. None of these Hong Kong action-style bottomless guns. Very realistic, and very refreshing. The DVD includes a hilarious script excerpt which was not filmed, and vividly illustrates McQuarrie's understanding of the Hollywood cliches he eschews.Not a perfect movie, but very nearly. The re-watchability quotient is very high. I recommend it highly. And if you don't like it, then you'll just have to wait patiently for Pearl Harbor.

There will be the mindless comparisons to Tarantino, Peckinpah, maybe even a Tony Scott here and there, but I'd like to think that if you really watched the movie, you can evaluate it in it's own right, as it's own creative statement and work of art. Now I'm a fan, my take on the film is that it's brilliant. MY pick for the best movie of 2000. It's expressly because it's a basic crime movie that I feel this way. There are over a hundred movies in this genre released every year. Most debut on video or late night cable and are never heard from again. Some manage to get A-list stars and Joel Silver or Jerry Bruckheimer to produce them and wind up with $20 million dollar openings. And some, like this one, feature movie actors, acting out brilliant scenes and dialogue, in front of a great director (as I'm sure he will prove to be).  And the fact that he made this type of movie, but in a fresh, creative, even intelligent way, is what makes him so good. In a few years people are gonna go see Alexander the Great or whatever else McQuarrie does and then hear about this and go back to their video store and rent this puppy and it will probably have the same resurgence Reservoir Dogs did after Pulp Fiction came out. It's a shame just because a movie isn't as slick and Hollywood as Con-Air or Lethal Weapon it's either a straight to cable offering, or, if it's good, a Tarantino rip-off. I think we need a few more categories. Sorry about the manifesto, but I'm a bit riled at how poorly this movie was received. Either I'm seeing something in it that isn't there, or a whole lot of people are really missing something. The writer-director phenomenon is just getting bigger and bigger all the time, which I think is a good thing. Especially if it breeds more like Christopher McQuarrie.

The gun battles are wonderfully done and look very origional.  In all reality, for all the shooting in the movie, its not really that graphic.  Save for a few instances with the C-section and the fountain, there is nothing out of the ordinary about the carnage in Way of the Gun.I thought that Del Toro's performance in this flick is one that will be looked back on as a truly star making performance.  Benicio oozes cool in every scene, and carries immense gravitas in every scene, even holding his own with Sonny Corleone himself.  However, average people dont take to un charismatic bad guys, and these guys are cool, but no Jules.  As for Philippe,  I managed to forget it was him for most of the last 3/4 of the movie, so thats kudos to him.As for muddled subplots and bad pacing, they go hand in hand. Building gravity for all the characters, McQuarrie went a lil overboard with the slow shots and dramatic music.  On a side note, great music, perfectly appropriate for the movie.For these problems, I still gave the movie 9 out of 10.  A marvelous story for people who can see humor in dreary situations, and can appreciate great detail put into scenes.  See the car chase towards the beginning.  A great movie, will hopefully see new life on DVD like Resevoir Dogs.

I for one, thought it lived up to those expectations without being a blatant rip-off of Usual Suspects. The film also marks McQuarrie's directing debut.To put it simply, The Way of The Gun is a great movie. The plot has as many twists as we would expect from McQuarrie, and it's a very good plot in general. Unlike most action movies, it has a plot. It's a very intelligent movie, yet still has plenty of action. It also has a very sleek modern western look to it. McQuarrie seems to be as good a director as he is a writer.The acting is also very good. I was surprised at how good Ryan Phillipe's performance was. I wasn't really expecting too much from him, but I honestly think his performance is Oscar-worthy (of course action movies never get nominated, but I still think he deserves it). Benico Del Toro was great as well. Taye Diggs was also very good in his role as a cold, emotionless bodyguard for Juliette Lewis, who was also good. The rest of the cast was good as well. The great thing about the characters, is that there are no clear good or bad guys. Lewis' character is the only really good one. You feel sorry for Parker and Longbaugh (Phillipe and del Toro), but they are just as bad as the people chasing after them. It's so much better than having stereotypical characters that are either all good or all bad.Overall, this is a great, great film. I can't think of anything else to say.

The Way of the Gun is the directorial debut of `The Usual Suspects' writer Christopher MacQuarrie.  So this time around we hear and see both his verbiage and vision executed.  The picture starts off by grabbing you in one of the funniest tirade of testosterone ever heard by a woman on screen.  This is just an appetizer until the main course is completely served.The two continue their chase for money by stopping at a sperm bank.  An attempted deposit fails then profits when they overhear a loose conversation of a surrogate mother and the wealthy beneficiary couple.The two cleverly kidnap the surrogate mother played innocently by Juliet Lewis under the fierce protection of two equally dangerous bodyguards (Taye Diggs and Nicky Katt).  After skillfully losing the bodyguards, the pawn is placed to serve its bargaining purpose.The wealthy couple has no regard for the mother but rather the child she carries.  So with this notion in mind the orders to the henchmen are to simply retrieve the unborn child by any means.  The film's many textured sidebars of individual purpose gives sure personality to the conflicting character of the players.  As quick as compassion mysteriously appears, bloodthirsty criminal instincts overcome. MacQuarrie's direction and dialogue are excellent cadavers for this gifted cast ensemble to breathe amazing life into.You don't go into a film as precisely crafted as this to try to guess the outcome.  You observe the talent, absorb the twisted story and appreciate the adventure.

It's also a very ambiguous theme that leaves us constantly questioning the motives of each of these characters.Do they really care about the life and safety of an innocent baby or do they do the stuff they do strictly for themselves (either out of greed or the promise of soul redemption)?  It seems to me that most of the principle characters in this film are in a constant inner tug-of-war within themselves over what exactly the right thing to do is.

It was everything I was expecting it to be from one of the most creative writers in the business. This is precisely the kind of movie I like to watch after a summer full of crappy megabudgeted, special effects laden movies that are written by commitee. The direction and writing by McQuarrie were superb. The shootouts were outstandingly kinetic and had great panache but did not ape John Woo's or anyone else's style. Many seem to complain that this film is too long and it drags between the major setpieces. I can understand how impatient viewers would feel this way but I think if you are a fan of well written films(specially if it's a genre flick)like myself you will be riveted to your seat and enjoy the ride greatly. If however, you don't have the stomach for violence and powerful language then stay away. It's a shame that such a good film has not found an audience outside of the hard core film fan set of movie goers. The entire cast from Juliette Lewis to her dad Geoffrey Lewis was excellent but I think the standout performances were delivered by Benicio Del Toro, James Caan and Taye Diggs. I don't know why the hell Mr. Del Toro isn't more well known. He is without a doubt one of the most natural and original actors working today. He's able to convey more information about his character without uttering a word than most of the members of the $20 million actor's club. What it would take a lesser performer two minutes of dialogue to express Mr. Del Toro does with one look or movement. I hope he finds the success he deserves. James Caan is his usual brilliant self and brings a lot of depth to his role as the bagman between the protagonists and their goals. Taye Diggs continues to make great acting choices. I've only seen him in a few films but it's obvious this actor has taste in choosing scripts. He makes a character who is not likable in the least seem human and capable of reflection. Even though this movie has no good guys but only varying degrees of bad you root for the Del Toro and Ryan Phillipe. One of the great things about living in a democracy is that everyone is entitled to their opinion. However, I would like to correct the reviewer who stated that this film was an unprofessional mess. In regards to the four times you saw boomikes during the film. THIS IS NOT THE FILMAKER'S FAULT BUT THE MOVIE THEATER PROJECTIONIST'S. I saw this film on two ocassions in two different theaters and DID NOT encounter such a problem. Obviously the projectionist did not frame the screen properly to display the correctly. The film was shot in full negative but intended to be displayed in theaters matted at an 1.851 aspect ratio. I'm sure that in today's dvd culture even the most backwards WalMart shopperr is aware of different widescreen proportions but I don't think most know the difference between a film shot in The American Flat Standard with an open (soft) matte and one shot with a hard matte. If you want to know a little more just do a little research on the net. Disliking or liking a film is everyone's perogative but acusing professionals of incomptence is quite another.

And I myself was slightly ambivalent after I saw the movie but when it comes down to making a judgement call I give this movie a 9/10, although what I saw was unexpected it worked for me. I won't give any key parts of the film away but I'd like to say this (and this won't come as a surprise to any avid movie fan or for people in their late teens and up) but this movie like tragically many was misadvertised.And because of this, I believe this is the reason the movie hasn't done as successful as it deserves to do, after all I personally found it to be an engrossing story with all sorts of plot twists, strategizing, backstabbing, doublecrossing, set-ups, presenting knowledge and wisdom of the life of a bagman on top of the well choreographed shoot-outs. This movie is a hell of a lot more cerebral than it is a mindless simple action movie, with two comedic (at least their backgrounds) antiheros. And that's where the trailer for this movie fails to do it justice or deliver or represent accurately what the movie is about to potential viewers. Its like the old sales trick called bait and switch, they front what they think is going to sell the movie (generically sex and violence and some comedy) and what you get is totally different. I'm 26 years old and even I know the sales and marketing people's predictability when it comes to advertising. They should quit insulting the intelligence of the general population and be more honest with the way they present there product so a masterpiece of film like this doesn't paradoxically leave people disappointed because that wasn't what they were expecting. Anyways, I digress a little (but I had to get that out of my system!). Getting to the point the trailer, makes it looks like these two yahoos rip off a pregnant surrogate mother and hold her for ransom to the rich potential foster parents. This is true, but what the preview doesn't show you is the significance of the other players involved (don't get me wrong, the preveiw should by no means give away the movie but provide a more accurate view of what's in store). The so called principals (lead characters) of this movie are only in it for about 35-40 minutes. I found this movie to represent I believe the sum total of 8 characters involved or effected by this situation in an almost uniformally, even-handed, balanced representation of screen time and dialogue. After the first 15-20 minutes through the film the principals fade into the background (now if you were like most people you'd expect them to be in the majority of the movie, let's say 3/4?). But what they end up becoming are players to the situation, the situation  becomes the center of attention and not the principals. I guess a better preview for this movie would be to show all 8 charaters involved, briefly show how they are involved and show a little conversation (because the film is 85-90% dialogue and not mostly shooting) and change the title (I knew some marketing genius came up with that one to sell the movie!). I humbly confess I can't think of a better one, but once you see the film you'll know what I mean.

McQuarie has not done a lot to impress me in the past.  Unlike the majority of people, I did not like The Usual Suspects.  But The Way of the Gun might well be titled The Way to make a GREAT Movie.A quick point of interest the city line shot at the beginning of the film is Albuquerque,NM my home town.  This movie is about two guys that kidnap a girl for ransom from some wealthy but very dangerous people. The cliche's end there. Instead of trying to convince the audience that the players in action are seriously bad-ass by having the actors posture for the camera, we learn how seriously dangerous they are from the no-holds-barred script and the extremely clever and inventive action sequences.  This movie is full of neat little tricks that as I watched I kept thinking, thats a cool idea, I gotta remember that if I am ever in a gunfight.  This movie keeps you interested every step of the way, the gun battles are numerous but always new, and the action flows smoothly from one scene to the next at fast pace. There are NO slow spots in this movie.  Remember how intense the gun battle was in HEAT during the fight with the cops after robbing the bank?  That is what this film is like from beginning to end.McQuarrie has entered the ranks of directors Paul Verhoven and James Cameron.  In light of both the aforementioned director's latest films, I thought Hollywood no longer had a director with real balls.  I liked movies like the Terminator, and Robocop because they didn't pull any punches. Those movies showed violence and brutality for what they are.  What is really scary when you watch a movie like that is the realization that brutality can equal power. The ruthlessness depicted in Way of the Gun would impress the TERMINATOR himself.Go see this movie.  But be prepared to squirm during a few scenes.  Besides extreme violence there is also some torture and plenty of blood.  But every shot of the movie is like a work of art.  I was very impressed with the photography of every scene.

Hollywood sees brand names in every human under contract. McQuarrie being no exception, he had to make another crime film instead of moving on to other kinds of stories, as he'd prefer.WAY OF THE GUN is McQuarrie's writer-director debut, and it is brilliant. He is a natural set-shot kind of guy, with great instincts, as seen in every scene of this very taut, very layered piece. The characters in the film, all of them, are twisted from previous brutality, or violence of one form or another. The two hoods Parker and Longbaugh (Phillppe and the unbelievable del Toro) commit themselves to the kidnapping of a nine-months pregnant surrogate mother for a very wealthy magnate played by the great Scott Wilson. The surrogate is protected by the machine-like bodyguards Diggs and Katt, who are professional thugs in impeccable business suits, alternate mirror images of Parker and Longbaugh. Simultaneously, another couple of criminals, another mirror image of these other men, but much older and scarred from a lifetime of violence, the brilliant James Caan and Jeffrey Lewis, begin the hunt to bring the kidnappers down and retrieve the mother. The very pregnant surrogate (a fine Juliette Lewis, Jeffrey's real-life daughter) and the child she carries is the center of the escalating conflict, in which all these men, these differing versions of violent lives, detonates at once in the showdown in a sleazy Mexican town. This is one of the best crime films ever made, and it is because of the synergy between McQuarrie and his stunning cast. This is a movie that is broken up into three acts, three gut-wrenching shoot-outs. Along the way, every faction tells their story, and why they are as they are, and how little a damn they give if you understand them or not. Caan should be nominated for best Supporting. And McQuarrie deserves a chance now to do whatever the hell it is he wants to do, in the Hollywood system, out from under his Oscar shadow.

Reminiscent of the spaghetti westerns of the late 60's and exploitation films of the early 70's,  Way is an unabashed violent movie - bullets fly, people get hit and blood literally flows.  The overall feel of the movie is also similar.Everything, from the locations to the cinematography, gives Way a western feel the lighting in the exterior shots is very harsh, the landscape is nondescript and the hideout looks especially rustic (I expected Clint Eastwood to walk out of the saloon at any moment).  Add gritty sound quality (I'm assuming it was intended) and anti-heroes on a possible path to redemption and the image is complete. The characters continue this theme.Ryan Phillipe and Benicio Del Torro, although more foul-mouthed, and murderous are obviously patterned on Butch and Sundance with a touch of Tarantino thrown in (gallows humor and philosophizing - thankfully they don't dwell on these qualities) to give them a more modern feel.  While they come across as mediocre caricatures, they do what is required of them- pull triggers, grunt out the odd line and bleed.  Taye Diggs' however, takes the cold-tough-guy schtick too far and ends up sounding like Mario Van Peebles in Solo.

Films like To Live and Die in L.A. and Reservoir Dogs definitely fall under this category.  The Way of the Gun is the latest action film that must be taken seriously.There are two main elements that make all of the movies above seem so real.  One of these elements is the fact that there are no good guys, nobody clean-cut to root for.  Sure, Parker and Longbaugh are the protagonists, the ones whose side we should be on.  But they are clearly not good men and could easily be oppossed by the audience.Another aspect of these films that make them real is that anyone can die at any point during the film.  I will not go into detail for those who have not seen any of these films, but, if you have, you know that each of them has a character or two who die against typical Hollywood fashion. Now, I realize that I have been saying a lot about realistic action films and not about The Way of the Gun in particular.

Why wrong? Because they now have to deal with Taye Diggs and Nicky Katt one one side, and James Caan and Geoffrey Lewis on the other. Either way, they are not likely to survive.Scott Wilson (Sam Braun on CSI Crime Scene Investigation) is the expectant father and boss of all these thugs. His wife, Francesca (Kristin Lehman) can't be bothered having a baby, so they hire Robin (Juliette Lewis) to have it. There is a lot more things going on, but that would be spoiling it. Suffice it to say that this will not end up as anyone expects.Bullets fly throughout this film that features a great car chase and some outstanding dialog.An under-appreciated jewel.

This movie entertained me, and kept me watching through out. Never once did I feel bored enough to get up and grab a pop, or make some pop corn. I actually waited until the very end to use the bathroom. Benicio Del Toro comes across in his usual spaced out method, and Phillipe surprised me greatly with his performance. As always, James Caan is a delight to watch on screen, as are most of the other supporting roles. Personally, I think someone like Natalie Portman, or Christina Ricci could have better pulled off the innocence of a newly expecting mother in replacement of Lewis, but we can't have all merits without a single flaw now, can we?A good movie.

I'm gonna tell him I was framed.In the wake of Tarantino's runaway success in the early 90s, many imitators followed, making a lot of bad indie flicks. Christopher McQuarrie is responsible for two of the few good movies in this sub-genre; the first is The Usual Suspects, which he wrote, and the second is The Way of the Gun, which he wrote and directed. Of those two films, this is the weaker (mostly because of McQuarrie's inexperience at directing), but it's still a treat.The viewer is introduced to our heroes (not really the appropriate term since there aren't any good guys in this film), Benecio Del Toro and Ryan Phillippe, in a very funny fight scenes set to the classic Stones song Rip This Joint. This a good warm up for a movie full of great dialogue, funny situations, and well used music. Hard up for money, the two become sperm donors. In the waiting room they overhear a phone conversation which ends up leading them to their next attempt at big money. Juliette Lewis is a woman being paid to have a baby for a wealthy couple who are connected to the mafia. Del Toro and Phillippe kidnap Lewis (in a brilliant scene) and are pursued by body guards and mafia hit men. McQarrie is careful to establish every character and make them all somewhat loathsome in a likeable sort of way. The dialogue is terrific, laced with catchy lines like We're not talking about how long you're gonna live, we're talking about how slow you're gonna die. And I can honestly say this is the only movie I've seen where the McGuffin (plot-moving object of desire) is an unborn baby.I won't blow the ending, but anyone who's seen a lot of Del Toro's or Phillippe's movies will know what to expect. Caan is great as usual as the aged mafia bag man who's seen it all. Keep in mind that this isn't strictly an action movie or a comedy. The Way of the Gun is a 90s crime-drama. This is a film to be appreciated mostly on the strengths of its dialogue, its cast, and the complete strangeness of its situations. It can't measure up to Reservoir Dogs or The Usual Suspects, but holds its own against Suicide Kings and Poolhall Junkies. I highly recommend this to fans of the cast and of the I-wish-I-was-Tarantino genre. Until that day. "},{"Title":"Unconventional and violent.

Everyone in the film has his own agenda and is willing to do what it takes to get the job done. For me Del Toro en Caan (in one of his best roles in years) are two reasons why to see this movie. But the script has more to offer like some very funny moments with the two main characters in the beginning of the film and at a spermbank. The direction is steady and uncompromising.

Soon they encounter some of his hired henchman, led by James Caan. With Taye Diggs, vet Geoffrey Lewis, and Nicky Katt as those either getting caught in the crossfire or offering fire towards Phillippe and Del Toro. Caan's being the father to Lewis adds a bit of gravitas to the gunfight, while Phillippe and Del Toro always attempting to make that big score against him proves to be the great question of will they or won't they? Way of the Gun is a guns-a-blazing shoot 'em up with credible car chases and a really bonafide western standoff at the end with the film's anti-heroes unloading ammunition at Caan and company with a brunt of the damage inflicted on the brothel itself. Not to be outdone, there is plentiful bloodshed and bodies are most certainly torn apart by some of the bullets that don't destroy the walls and shutters. Phillippe and Del Toro most definitely don't escape the film unscathed, and Caan's not even receiving one bullet during the whole affair, considering all the bullets that fire in all directions I found rather clever. There are really few characters in the movie to side with or care about, so Way of the Gun rests almost exclusively on its gunplay which is in abundance and full display. Del Toro is his usual quirky self while Phillippe is so intense he could crack walnuts between his ass cheeks. Caan is&#x85;well&#x85;Caan, so if you like him then here he is. Lewis plays her part relatively straight as the unfortunate barter item as bullets go off all around her. Dyllan Kussman as the surgeon burdened with trying to monitor Lewis' health and deliver the child if needed is like a fawn trapped in a dangerous forest surrounded by bears. I like the way the gunfights are staged and how these men shoot aimlessly mostly, rarely hitting their targets until a mistake of revealing themselves at the wrong time results in their demise. Diggs' fate in particular is rather startling. Phillippe's dive into a dried-up water fountain filled with broken bottles verifies the unpredictable nature of getting in a gunfight in the middle of nowhere when circumstances can rise against you. The draw is given a bit of irony as the film's typical anti-hero doesn't have any bullets left and, as a result, is put down due to his wasted ammo while the opposition has a seat comfortably.

I thought he was gawd-awful in Eraser (1996), wooden in Honeymoon in Vegas (1992) and was at has absolute worst in a good movie with his role as trapped author Paul Sheldon in Misery (1990).  So when I cruised the video store and came across the DVD of Christopher McQuarrie's 2000 release, Way of the Gun, James Caan's name beside the title gave me second thoughts.  However, I knew that Christopher McQuarrie wrote the wonderfully intertaining and Oscar winning The Usual Suspects, so I picked up the release and hoped for the best.  And the best is exactly what I got.The movie consists of a number of where-do-I-know-him froms.  Academy Award winner Benicio Del Toro and Ryan Phillippe play Longbaugh and Parker, Juliette Lewis plays the pregnant Robin, Taye Diggs and Nicky Katt are the bodyguards, Jeffers and Obecks, and Geoffery Lewis and James Caan portray the bagmen, Abner and Joe.The story, also written by McQuarrie is complex and demands your utmost attention.  In a nutshell, Robin is a surrogate mother carrying the baby for a gangster and his wife.  The wife is having an affair with the bodyguard Jeffers and Joe is the father of Robin who is hired by the gangster to rescue Robin when she is kidnapped by Longbaugh and Parker.  Follow? Well, it gets more complicated.  We find out Robin's doctor is also the son of the gangster and the actual father of the baby.  Whew!  All this and no party had an idea how the others were involved.Although his directorial debut, McQuarrie has a way of keeping our interests through complex stories and a knack for introducing us to new characters - a quiet introduction to Abner trying to commit suicide is an example of how he develops characters upon first meeting.What is most remarkable is how rookie McQuarrie is able to give this violent, contemporary film the feel of a 1960's Sergio Leone western.  The main characters are criminals that are severely flawed, the dialogue is crisp and to the point and each individual is playing an angle with no real 'good guy' present.So it is fitting that the movie ends in a Mexican hotel shoot-out.    The bagmen come to collect their revenge on Parker and Longbaugh, and the violence is back dropped by the messy c-section delivery of Robin's child in one of the rented rooms.  A gun fight ensues that is more than enjoyable (and this says a lot since we have been treated to such gunfest operas as The Matrix and The Terminator films in recent years) than it should be and the ending is typical Sergio Leone in that it comes down to the last man standing.So, I was wrong about James Caan.  Sort of.  He is still a terribly one dimensional actor that can barely move his neck and therefore reminds me of a human Robocop, however, his presence in this film is fitting and he is utilized in appropriate moderation by direction McQuarrie.Way of the Gun is a good film and is what Saturday afternoon in front of the TV was made for.

Another great aspect of the film is that we do not have long monologs in which the characters justify their motivation; it is revealed though their acts.

Juilette Lewis does a wonderful job at playing a surrogate mother, espacillay with all of her facial expressions through out the movie. In the movie everyone is bad, there is not a single good person. Even the good guy's have dark secerts that you figure out as the movie goes on. The Ryan Phillippe is just FABULOUS through the whole movie. Just how he looks at people and how he moves and uss his gun. He does a great job showing his emotions. Benicio also is good even though he does not have near as many lines. He's diner seen between him and James Caan is the best part of the movie. I recommend this movie a lot!!!!

Fuhgeddaboudit!","Date":"23 November 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":"  This is one of those films that I like and I loathe, and I'll try to explain it why.  Get ready...First off, what I love about this movie.I love all of the actors especially Phillippe and Del Toro who turn in excellent performances as our two anti-hero protagonists, and of course, James Caan is the usual cool as ice character he normally plays.  Nicky Katt and Taye Diggs were simply awesome as the homicidal bodyguards who mostly let their actions speak louder than their words.  I love the directing, Christopher McQuarrie, the writer of The Usual Suspects, one of the best movies of all time, takes the helm as a first time director and does a remarkable job.  The gunfight at the end has some of the most impressive editing I have ever seen, and the whole movie is shot very well, especially for a first time director.  Speaking of the gunfights, I have to admit this, though I absolutely loved the psychological mind tricks of The Usual Suspects, and though this one has a few, somewhat sophomorish in comparison plot twists as well, what suckered me into buying this one after seeing it in the theaters were the intense and realistic gunfights.  Realistic as in there aren't any superhero a la Ahnold scenes where our heroes simply mow down the 'bad' guys, our heroes get pretty shot up during the course of the film, and especially in the end where Ryan Phillippe finds a nasty surprise after he vaults into an empty fountain.  Also, I was amazed at how accurate the filmmakers were with the authenicity of the guns themselves.  First off, there was no editing for the noises, those loud bangs you hear are the actual gunshots fired in real time by the actors.  I remember seeing this in the crappy college theater a few years ago...the gunshots literally shook the theater...I'm not kidding, they would make you jump out of your seat, which to me is incredible.  That kind of authentic detail is what really sold me into buying this movie, and plus, these guys carry Colt 1911 .45's, which each can hold a clip of 7 rounds...during the gunfights, they reload constantly, and you can count shot for shot, the 7 bullets almost everytime (except for one scene where Benicio is laying on the ground after being shot...minor gripe if anything), call me fastidious or obsessed with detail, but this was one of the few actioners that had gunfights that didn't have me groaning at some huge Hollywood inaccuracy.  You can tell the actors had fun 'shooting' (no pun intended!) these scenes, and the sound is incredible.Okay, those were the good points of the film, now onto the reasons why I can't give this one an 8 or a 9 rating.I can sum up my biggest complaint with this movie in one word.  Pacing. Pacing, or lack there of.  The beginning and end are very exciting, it's just that the middle 45 minutes or so can simply drag on and on.  There are times where the actors are speaking, and there is too much 'think' time and idle pauses to truly get involved with the scene.  I know some people don't mind this, but it drove me insane, I mean the film is around 2 hours, but it really feels like a 3 hour movie.  They could have trimmed this one to 90 minutes, and it still could have been a good movie.  You'll know exactly what I'm talking about if you watch this one...you'll go from one exciting gunfight to a scene where two characters are overanalyzing the plot and talking at their leisure about their view on the situation.  Also, there are scenes that make their point within the first 10 seconds, but drag on, with the same camera frame focused on the same character, usually just sitting there staring into the distance (like that freaky scene with the trophy wife staring at the ultra sound for like 5 minutes).  It is well directed, just poorly edited, which really kills the momentum of this flick.  The Usual Suspects had a wonderfully brilliant storyline that threw the viewer into a million twists and turns, yet, at a very exciting pace.  The Way of the Gun is similar, in this respect, yet, it will drag on and on and on until you feel like screaming at the TV, enough already!Like The Usual Suspects, McQuarrie provides many plot twists and turns, however he kind of goes overkill.  I mean, after a couple of viewings, I understand the whole plot, but to me, it is not really 'brilliant'.  We find out these plot twists not through intuition or a keen eye, but through the character's discussions, which last at least half of the movie, and often have a bunch of pointless filler.  I could tell some scenes (such as when they are playing hearts and Del Toro is explaining the rules of the game...which is supposed to be symbolic of the situation) were trying too hard to be inteligent or have a hidden meaning.  Also, in the beginning, we are treated to a series of scenes which sure as heck reminded me, and others as I've read the reviews, as another Pulp Fiction type movie.  I'm sorry, but the beginning screams of Pulp Fiction...the witty dialogue, the over the top violence in the beginning, the absolutely funny one-liners given at the sperm bank...hey, don't get me wrong, I loved this part of the movie, yet it is so out of place and is misleading to the viewer.  I'd say the movie is wonderful up until the kidnappers leave the gas station after seeing the doctor (who by the way is a really bad actor).  From there, you have about a 45 minute lull that is interesting at times, but will bore you to death at others, especially considering the great action in the beginning...you have to endure these 45 minutes in order to be rewarded with the other great action scenes at the end.  It's these 45 minutes or so that makes this one a hard choice for repeated viewings, and makes great use of the 'skip chapter' button on the dvd remote, at least once you understand the plot of the movie, which may take a few viewings to get.  Oh and btw, if you can't stand pregnancy scenes, just like I can't stand them, this is not the movie for you.  The scenes with Juliette Lewis are very graphic and a little too realistic.  Once again, bad editing is to blame...watching a pregnant woman scream in pain for 5 minutes at a time is simply unpleasant to watch...we get the point after the first 5 seconds!Okay, so I've listed the good and the bad (the ugly is probably in there too somewhere...) of this movie...for me I usually love or hate a film, this one is truly a black sheep to me, which is why I wrote an equally balanced review.  But, I must say, the good qualities do outweigh the bad ones, or why would I have bought the dvd?  This is a movie that not everyone will like, but is good to watch alone or with another movie buff.  It does make you think on some level, but don't expect another outing of The Usual Suspects...this one really tries too hard to be 'smart' and at times, 'hip'. But, it has some really impressive acting, great characters and action scenes that rival The Wild Bunch.  Speaking of that movie, you can tell that this one is a tribute or a copy to Sam Peckinpah's anti-hero western shoot-em-up.  Our 'heroes', Parker and Longbaugh simply have no desire to live and go for an all or nothing heist which goes terribly wrong (I love the line where Del Toro tells James Caan as they are having coffee that 'I don't think this is a brains sort of operation'), but they end up being, ironically, the most 'good' of all of the other characters (everyone is some sort of criminal or an up-to-no-gooder).  All in all, not a bad film, just like others have said, this could have been a great film which is why this review is so hard to write and is so torn between sides.  Like it or loathe it, this one will entertain you pretty well, just make sure that you keep the fast forward button primed and ready during the slow scenes, unless you haven't seen it before and want to understand the complex plot, which by the way, had me scratching my head the entire time during my first viewing. Now that I understand it though, it isn't exactly a life altering experience, though.  Anyways, watch this one for the acting and the action...I'd love to give this one a high rating, but I just can't...the editing is absolutely horrible.  That is my story, and I'm sticking to it.  6/10 stars  "},{"Title":"I'll bet you've never seen the heist of a pregnant woman in another movie!!!","Date":"9 October 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":"     WAY OF THE GUN is a very exciting, violent, and at times funny movie.(Shut the ---- up before I come over there and ---- start her head)However, I own the movie and have seen it a number of times and the plot still managaes to lose me at times.

The world must be a different place when you have no remorse about your actions and the swagger in which they conduct themselves is beyond reproach. Speaking of cool James Caan as the bagman in pursuit of the duo is unbelievable. He's almost James Bond like in the way he feels he's going to get his job done one way or the other. The rest of the cast all carry out their respective duties well and it all just blends together to make a film that really is enjoyable to watch. The main points i would like to raise aside from this it has a brilliant final scene featuring all the action you could wish for. But then comes out with a closing sentence that's just confusing.

In one review I read, the critic rather sheepishly says that the movie is flawed but there is some great movie somewhere in it. Hum. This is like saying that any blue-eyed blonde with an hourglassy figure can be a potential Marilyn.The story starts out with a couple of losers who overhear a conversation about millionaires and surrogate mothers in a sperm bank and on that basis they hatch a harebrained plot for a kidnapping. If you've read enough hardboiled literature you'll know that things will go to hell soon enough, and they do, but in rather unexpected, and not very credible, ways. The increasingly confusing action involves a flight to Mexico, a mafia henchman with a rather supernatural skill to show up all over the place, the losers' loser friend who mysteriously turns out to be a friend also of the other bad guys, a stressed mafia boss, his deranged wife and his son, a doctor with a serious ethics problem and who on top of that, can't act. And, for a Spanish-speaker like myself the movie has yet another reason to be grating whenever the characters speak in Spanish, whatever they say is unintelligible. Starting with the name of the Mexican hotel, Nació Madre. In really hackneyed Spanish (I mean, no real Spanish-speaking person would use such a phrase, and much less name a hotel with it), this means something like a mother was born.

This movie doesn't dumb anything down for the audience.  There are no overdrawn soliloquies explaining what's going on, what just happened, or what is about to happen.  Like the characters in the film, it's your job to pay attention to all the subtle clues and figure out for yourself exactly what's going on, who knows what, and why each character does what he does.  You can watch this movie again and again and learn something new each time.  Which, in my opinion, is one of the major hallmarks of a great film.  What makes the movie even more amazing is that it is the directorial debut of Christopher McQuarrie, who also wrote the script and helped pen another great suspense movie, The Usual Suspects.

However, after about the first 20 minutes, things start to slow down, and don't truly pick back up until the last 30 minutes.

When would two ne'er-do-well petty criminal drifters have the money -- or the *discipline* -- to enroll in and complete advanced tactical firearms training courses? This sort of training is not cheap, and the few private academies that offer it that I know of are pretty darn exclusive. I mean they screen their applicants pretty carefully. Just to be accepted as a student in most of them you need pretty sterling credentials -- often a letter of introduction from your local police chief or sheriff or chief magistrate; though sometimes a state-issued permit to carry concealed weapons will do, as the presumption there is that legit permit holders are a pretty select group, having already been screened by their state authorities.I suppose it could all be explained away by suggesting that the two gunmen have some sort of military background (though I sure never got that impression), since the Army is less choosy than the private gunfighting schools. But even then they'd have had to have been some sort of Spec-Ops types, because most of the techniques and moves they were using aren't taught in Basic Training or even in Infantry School.There was at least one tactic Del Toro employed that seemed foolish and amateurish to me (BIG-TIME SPOILER ALERT!)(SPOILER SPACE)When he emptied the high-capacity magazine of his .308-caliber Galil battle rifle *blindly* stitching a row of bullet holes through a wall, in the vain hope of taking out a single opponent he couldn't see on the other side. He thus pointlessly expended all the ammunition for his best and most powerful weapon, which would otherwise have stood him and his partner in good stead when the small army of Mob triggermen showed up.Still, it's an interesting movie, one that I'd like to see again sometime.

Benicio complemented him perfectly with his sly, mysterious, and wisecracking aloofness.  James Caan is James Caan.  If you've seen the Godfather, I don't have to tell you what he is capable of.  I like this movie because it is very much a guy movie, with all the violence and gunplay, but the plot is so much more detailed than anything Jerry Bruckheimer would ever dream of producing.

Movies cater to a passive mindset.Films, on the other hand, follow fewer rules, have anywhere from one to five acts, more convoluted protagonist and antagonist roles, and characters that are neither wholly good nor wholly bad.  Most of all, films use a much more challenging narration technique where tighter dialog, subtext, visual style, facial expressions, and long silences are used to move the plot along. Films *require* that the viewer pays attention to every word, and every facial expression, and every moment of silence.  Films are designed for the active mindset. This is painful for anyone who has been spoiled by Hollywood movies, because it requires them to *think*!The Way of the Gun is definitely a film. I'd even go so far as to say it is a film noir.Accordingly, I absolutely LOVED Way of the Gun.  It was like a yoga workout for my brain...with 15 minutes of raunchy violence thrown in for flavor. Wonderful sub-text, a remote and almost-voyeuristic feel to the POV, and visceral action scenes all made this film a worthwhile 90 minutes for me.Mind you, I also loved Miller's Crossing, Fargo, O Brother Where Art Thou, Reservoir Dogs, Heat, and Snatch.If you want a mentally-active flick with some deadly gunfights, then I highly recommend this rental. If you're looking for a mindless shoot-em-up, then look elsewhere... this film is for thinking people only.

But what struck me most is how little I got to see of him.  Bearing in mind he is the second lead in this film, his brilliant acting skills are not given nearly enough chance to shine.  That being said, the interaction between Beni and Philippe is worth a watch for sure - it's just a shame too much time is handed to the likes of Juliette Lewis, who in my opinion completely ruins this movie.  'The Usual Suspects' was great because it didn't try to do what it surely couldn't - mix macho fight scenes with sentimental rubbish.  'The Way of the Gun', I feel, falls short in this area.  I, for one, wasn't interested in any kind of sub-plot involving a stuck-up middle-class couple.  What I did like were the pure, excellent action sequences, particularly during the first half of the movie, and a bloody end sequence reminiscent of the spaghetti westerns. Of course, every minute that Del Toro is on screen, he simply is the epitome of coolness, and showing nice touches of humour as well.Overall I'd give it about 6.5 out of 10 - but it could well have been 8 were it not for some unnecessary scenes involving unnecessary characters.

I also enjoyed Juliette Lewis, again one of my favorite actors. The fact that all the plot pieces were not revealed in the first act was nice, you as an audience came to understand more about what was going on and more about the characters and their motives.

Whoever finds Mr. Parker and Mr. Longbaugh unlikeable (or better off dead) may want to examine why.  Both characters are unscrupulous - relying more upon their basic greed and lack of conscience than their idea of fair play or morality.  Some have complained that not only are these gentleman bad guys, but they have no redeeming qualities due to there dedication to criminal life.  Yeah, and? If these guys would have been named Henry Hill and Tommy De Vito - the world would have loved them.  For whatever reason, gangsters with no (or few) redeeming qualities score big at the box office, but not Mr. Parker and Mr. Longbaugh.  Instead, we see two men - and here's the scary part - two regular guys who have decided that the rules of the world are not set up for the average man.  They can become just another slave to the grind or go The Way of the Gun.  Unlike mobster films, we do not see the flashy cars, clothes, or women because these two men are simply desperados who are looking to make money - not a name for themselves.  They are driven by 100% self-preservation as are all criminals - the only difference is that Writer\Director Christopher McQuarrie didn't wrap a pretty package around the two men, but instead gave us a hard, cold look at their lives.With that said, I thought the dialogue in this movie was outstanding.  Too many movies today get by with terrible dialogue and big action scenes (or sex scenes).  Not that this movie did not provide action, but it was moved along by quality dialogue - a definite rarity in today's moronic, MTV, hip-hop influenced, idiot-box entertainment.  Don't get me wrong, this movie lived up to it's name with several gun battles and plenty of action, but it offered much to the viewer looking for something more than spoon-fed entertainment.  Even if you did not enjoy this film, I still would find it hard to not enjoy the opening, which was possibly one of the funniest scenes I have seen as of late.  No, I don't advocate violence against women, but in Mr. Parker and Mr. Longbaugh's world you better be prepared to Walk the Walk if you Talk the Talk.

Also, multiple viewings will allow you to see what's really going on between the lines.  Scenes that seemed forced and awkward on the first viewing make more sense and are totally fitting with the characters once you get to know them.  In other words, it's a strange request but don't judge the movie until you've seen it at least twice.  Unfortunately this means that people who weren't interested in this movie to begin with will most certainly dismiss it as a little too this or a little too that.  I was like that after my first viewing too, but I sat through it one more time as my friend was watching it and was really impressed.  I think I screwed myself up the first time by having expectations or, more accurately, assumptions about the movie and my brain just couldn't switch gears to adapt to what was being presented to me onscreen.  Maybe you won't have that problem and you'll be able to enjoy it right from the start.  Whatver.The best thing about the movie is the characters.  Every single character is fully developed and, most importantly, interesting.  Mr. Longbaugh and Mr. Parker are not hip, ironic icons of cool, like a lot of Pulp Fiction knock-offs.

They would not have everything under control.  They would not be likable criminals that swagger around getting involved in illegal hijinks.  They would be like these guys, hard and tough, desperate and lost.  Maybe I just got caught up in the movie too much, but *** MINOR SPOILER ALERT ***even the grizzled group of bagmen that James Caan brings along to the climactic showdown was interesting to me.  I could just imagine the things they had to do to survive and succeed in the movie's world, and that's not an easy thing for a movie to do.  I would cheer if McQuarrie decided to make a movie JUST about Joe Sarno and Abner.  You just know that these two guys have seen and experienced a lot as they survived in the underworld.  I'm sure a lot of the credit for how effective these characters were should go to the actors, but I'm also sure that McQuarrie had his own mythology about the characters and communicated that to the actors.  But I digress.....*** End of MINOR SPOILER ALERT ***A few people disliked the abundance of twists and revelations in the movie (Roger Ebert pointed this out in his review), but I thought all of them were plausible, logical, and subtly foreshadowed.  In other words, I never thought the movie cheated just to include an interesting plot twist. I read somewhere that this was McQuarrie's f**k you to people who pigeonholed him as a crime film maker and forced him into making another crime-drama.  I have no idea whether it's remotely true or not, but it sort of makes sense because this is the logical end-of-the-road for those kinds of movies.  Y'know, the one's with the type of characters I described above.  Snatch was an excellent fun movie, but compare the Dick Tracy characters in that to the realistic fully-realized characters in this movie (I know, apples and oranges.  I know, Snatch is supposed to be like that.  I'm not knocking it, I'm just trying to make a point).  Even the characters in Usual Suspects seem a little flat compared to the ones in WOTG.

Good use of cameras, overall good attention to detail particularly in the most important scenes the gunfights and overall good acting.Now to the negatives -  Some of the actors seemed too young to properly portray their roles.  Ryan Phillipe is too young to convince me that he can be an able sidekick to Benicio Del Toro.  The same goes for Taye Diggs.  A pregnant woman needs to look like she's pregnant, Lewis's portrayal is not too blame but how many leaned faced, skinny legged about to give birth pregnant woman do you see out there?

I don't understand what the purpose of the opening is other than to show you the faces of the two guys you'll be following around for the next two hours.  Their characters are not developed in any way that's consistent with the rest of the film, and if you ask me, I think the writer was just trying to get the viewers' attention.  Maybe it's to distract them from the fact that the rest of the film is one giant, steaming turd.For starters, the characters are severely underdeveloped.  There's a ton of potential, but the film never takes you beneath the first layer.  I thought the two most interesting characters were Jeffers and Obecks, and all we get on them is that they're detached and well-trained bodyguards that might be trying to pull a fast one.  Also, the plot was lame.  I don't know about anyone else, but I never got a straight answer as to why the Chidduck's wanted a surrogate mother and why they chose Robin.  What happened to Dr. Painter in Baltimore?  Why were there so many unneccessary twists?  What was the point of Abner?  His character served absolutely no purpose what so ever.  He had no effect on the other characters or the plot.  Also, someone send Ryan Phillippe back to acting school.  His range consists of one tone of voice, one facial expression, and one way of carrying himself.  A tree stump could out-act him.  And someone needs to slap Benicio Del Torro's agent because he either advised him to take this script or gave him the go ahead on it.  Del Torro is such a good actor, you really wonder what went through his head when he went along with this one.  Watch him in The Usual Suspects and then in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.  He makes Phillippe look like the supporting pilgrim in the 4th grade Thanksgiving play.And lastly, the whole Parker and Longbaugh thing is lame.  For those of you that don't know, those are the last names of Butch Cassidy (Robert Leroy Parker) and the Sundance Kid (Harry Longbaugh).  Lame, lame, lame.  If you waste your time on this film, you're just as stupid as the company that originally agreed to release it under their name.

The plot is definitely overlong and bloated, with far too many frankly stupid and pointless twists that dissipates any dramatic tension generated by the mostly promising beginning, especially the excellent comic scenes in the sperm bank. This didn't make the thriller complex as all the protagonists are basically after the same thing and so are never at the kind of cross-purposes that generate true drama, rather it induced a couldn't-care-less attitude in me. Everyone has a stake in the outcome of the kidnapping. So what? We already knew that. It's inefficient storytelling. Another beef I have is with the way Geoffrey Lewis' character is developed and then totally wasted in a pointless cameo role.However, the standard of acting was generally good- I especially liked Benecio del Toro and James Caan, and I worked out the doctor was a good guy by the way everyone else slapped him around. The ending too was good, with the money on the fountain- there's echos of the Wild Bunch and The Good The Bad and The Ugly (the ending with the cross, the rope and the money) and a few others in it. Also when James Caan appeared with his wrinkly cronies it reminded me of my uncle (who looks like Caan) and his muckers appearing for a cash-in-hand job, which amused me greatly. I certainly wouldn't criticise a film like this for being stylised as that's the whole point in it. However to claim that this is some kind of tour de force is a gross exaggeration.The central problem with this film was that it was trying too hard to be whatever it was trying to be. I think the director has a lot of potential but the writer needs to learn some discipline in his storytelling. And that's a lesson in economy of style killing one bird with two stones.

It is at times directed very creatively and stylishly.  Some gun battles, early on, are photographed in a gutsy new way.  The camera movement can be very creative, and the cinematography is almost unjustly good for the type of movie it is(in my opinion, Oscar-worthy, or at least the director of photography is.)But the movie is a mess.  It starts off intriguingly, and I was interested in what would happen.  It lost me about half way through.  The casting in this movie is bad; I am not a fan of Ryan Phillippe, but to be fair I'll say that he did a decent job.  However, I couldn't buy him in this role--he is too young and boy-like for it, and I didn't understand his motivation.  This is also true of the doctor character, Benecio Del Toro, and particularly Nicky Katt and Taye Diggs.  They do fine with their roles, however, they are both too young for me to believe that they are hardened bodyguards who don't care about dyeing, just losing.  This casting gave the movie an almost student film like feel, as if we were watching a movie directed by someone in their twenties, who cast young actors and his friends in the leads.  Don't get me wrong, it's alright to cast these actors, but it would have been more believable to see them as novices.I have often disliked a movie because I found that there were no likeable characters.  TWOTG has this big problem, but it actually manages to take this flaw a step further--I had no idea who I was supposed to be rooting for!  One might say that the two leads would be the best bet, but it is not that simple.  Eventually, I wanted this movie, growing darker and more bloody by the minute, to just wrap things up.  Instead, it just kept throwing more and more plot-twists at us.  Once I was lost I didn't even want to bother getting caught-up.From what I've heard, people who did like this film often claim that they really liked the final shoot-out at the Spanish mission.  But it really didn't work for me.  The earlier gun fights were gutsy and unpredictable.  This climactic scene is also gutsy, and shot unconventionally.  However, the director's risks failed this time.  It is often shot from afar, without cutting or moving in, for example the wide shot of Ryan Phillippe blasting his shotgun from behind the fountain.  It was intended to give us a fresh, being there sort of feeling.  But looking at it from afar, (again, with young actors) and the architecture of the movie-set-like church gave me the impression that I was watching a stunt show at a theme park.I acknowledge that this is mostly a matter of taste, and know that fans of The Way of the Gun like it as a dark action film.  However, the movie's promise in my eyes wasn't enough to overcome its flaws.  Grade C-  "},{"Title":"Creative articulation","Date":"30 September 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":"  The Way of the Gun is a good shoot'em up and pack'em dead film without the pretense of any buddy-buddy relationships a-la Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid nor the slick, stylized mind games of Pulp Fiction.   The star of show is, surprise, surprise, the gun. Or rather the violence of it.   The Way of the Gun teases us with a plodding buildup before taking us into two violent confrontations.  The film is forever sly  in its haphazard, whimsical displays mixed into a conventional story about amateurish criminals trying to buck the system.   Take the character, Dr. Painter, with a wound over his eye bandaged with oozing blood alternating with no blood in successive scenes or the bloodied and dying man sitting in his car who tells his friend that he would rather be alone or the suave killer, Mr. Jeffers (Taye Diggs) who prefers words of obfuscation like 'creative articulation'.  Take the bureaucratic interviewer of a sperm donation office who has his questions thrown back at him, the foiled kidnapped confrontation in which guns are drawn back instead of fired, the two chase scenes in the alleyway that resemble Oliver pursuing Hardy, and a rather crude Cesarean section taking place during a deadly firefight in a Mexican bordello.  The film deliberately withholds much empathy for any of the characters.   Parker (Ryan Phillippe) and Longbaugh (Benicio Del Toro) are the hapless amateurs, more catatonic than they are ferocious, with much of their dialogue mumbled like a bad James Dean imitation.  Of the two, Parker holds out some sense of humanity when he talks about assassinating a child molester and the insomnia which followed.  Longbaugh is the cold, steely misfit resigned to his fate and his brief negotiation with the bagman Joe Sarno (played deftly by James Caan) shows the irreversible paths both men are destined to follow.   There are overlapping conflicts between the troubled Dr. Painter and the pregnant Robin (Juliette Lewis),  the controlling Mr. Chidduck and his weak son, Joe the older henchman and the up-and-coming Jeffers, Francesca the mistress and her other lover, and even between Robin and Joe which are not entirely explained, adding to the intrigue of the film.  It is this intrigue which transforms this good action picture to one that makes you think - about the relationship of the characters and their inherent violence.

It's also the finest pure crime movie by far since RESERVOIR DOGS. (Recent noble entries such as THE LIMEY and JACKIE BROWN aren't as pure; they flirt with other sub-genres.)Like Bloody Sam, the writer-director Christopher McQuarrie (who won an Oscar for his USUAL SUSPECTS script and then spend the nineties in development hell) converts his bitterness at the Industry into genre terms. (To understand the movie fully, read Pauline Kael's review of THE KILLER ELITE and substitute THE WAY OF THE GUN at every opportunity.) Two outlaws, their aliases taken from the real names of Butch and Sundance (Ryan Philippe and Benicio Del Toro) kidnap a pregnant woman (Juliette Lewis) who seems to be worth a lot of money. When they find out that she's a surrogate mom for a rich, self-destructive, in-too-deep money launderer (Scott Wilson) the plot doesn't just thicken--it metastasizes.McQuarrie might just be the best sheer storyteller working in Hollywood right now. He tested his craft in the (for my money) too cute and self-conscious USUAL SUSPECTS, where the hyperdensity of plot seemed a sublimation of Tarantino's hyper-rococo language. Here, he creates a world so vicious, so labyrinthine, so through-the-looking-glass it's as if Borges took up dime fiction. The movie is about the venality that comes with a sum of money that is, in the words of an old button man played by James Caan, a motive with a universal adapter. The complications that ensue from the dummy duo's stab at big-time crime are as laden with regret as they are with menace; McQuarrie's novelistic world envelops you totally even as his plotting steamrollers forward with an almost fascistic relentlessness.There are beautiful characterizations everywhere. McQuarrie's scripts never seem to have been cast as well as they should have been, but here even Del Toro and Philippe, not two of my favorite actors, do more than admirable work, and the bit parts are revelations. Taye Diggs, as a severe-acting bodyguard who seems to want to be in the Secret Service, has a lean smartness unlike his other pose-y acting. Kristin Lehman, as the wife of Mr. Big, has a scene of Jacobean viciousness in which she deploys the strategic eating of jumbo shrimp with an almost pornographic violence that is stunning. Juliette Lewis shows the power you always suspected she would have when she became a real adult woman, and James Caan has not been this good in--what? Decades? Even Juliette Lewis' dad Geoffrey has a fantastic bit as a Joe Middle Class-looking hitter who spends his off hours rehearsing his own suicide.McQuarrie's sentiment here seems to be, You want me to do a crime movie? All right--here's what you get. And what you get both tops off the genre and sticks it down the audience's throat like a broken bottle. The ending--a perfect sealant on the toxic universe McQuarrie concocted--gives us the best two lines to close a movie in memory.This guy is a great filmmaker. One of those great last lines is about answered prayers; I pray somebody lets this guy make a movie again.

Christopher McQuarrie must've felt pressured to come up with a equally great  follow up to his Oscar winning screenplay for The Usual Suspects.  Unfortunately, this film  doesn't live up to the previous effort.  The script does have the twists and turns and surprises,  but McQuarrie as director seems unsure of himself.

The dialogue, rather than sounding poetic and philosophical, mostly comes off as stilted monotone.  You will not, at any time, mistake any of the characters for real people.The cast is top-flight talent, but most of them give wooden, uninteresting performances (memo to Ryan Phillippe a goatee and a scowl does not qualify you as a hard-bitten antihero.  Work on it.)  Nicky Katt and Taye Diggs seem like malevolent robots, and James Caan and his gang of codgery hit men appear to have wandered in from another movie, and not a better one.This movie undisputedly belongs to Benicio Del Toro, who gives his thug character the sort of sad, world-weary calm that makes McQuarrie's script work.McQuarrie's direction is the film's major asset.  While he hasn't got the sound of noir down, he has the look, and that goes a long way.For those for whom such things are important (like me!), the gun work in this movie is admirable, for the most part.  Del Toro and Phillippe handle guns and clear rooms as if they actually know what they're doing (which begs the question of where these two lowlife losers learned that stuff, but never mind).  Caan, on the other hand, seems to be another graduate of the Imperial Stormtrooper Marksmanship Academy.  Some of the early gunfights and chases are over-choreographed, but I can't quite hate a movie that shows a wounded man reloading his .45 by tucking it between his knees.

My case in point; Ryan Philippe's concern over his conscience, Juliette Lewis saying how she realised for the first time that she wanted to keep her baby.  Tarantino films simply give the viewer cartoon characters doing unbelievable things.  Something about The Way of the GUN is very REAL, despite that fact that this is one wild ride.  I still remember the suicidal henchman, asking James Caan in the sheriff car to leave in peace, he is going to die alone.The opening was terrible far too much crude dialogue, and punching the woman was tasteless.

The plot is much more complicated then that, but I think I would run out of room if I tried to explain it all. Gun's script is so deep, and at sometimes extremely confusing, you wonder how long it took Christopher MacQuarrie (writer of another ground-breaking film, The Usual Suspects) to write. In no way does the complicated and involved script take away from this movie.  MacQuarrie does such a good job at directing his own script that he has developed a new kind of filmmaking style. Gun is so original in every way that I couldn't begin to describe all of them.  If you are the kind of person who is bored by cliché gunfights, prepare to be pleasantly surprised.  MacQuarrie does an amazing job of making you feel like you are a witness to these amazing gun battles.  The sound effects are outstanding, and in one scene where a sniper rifle is used, you actually here the whizzing of the bullet past your ears. The bottom line of The Way of the Gun is that it breaks all of the rules.  Don't listen to the critics, don't be persuaded by anything you read, go out and see this movie. Even if you don't like it, you will still have respect for the originality of this film.

It was also funny, attacking mindless profanity (like to skullf**k babies ya' faget homo?) and delving into the morals of criminals (I never killed anybody I did'nt ask you if you did). But overall it was a movie of two outcasts whose only options in this modern world are petty crime and minimum wage. They are vagrants who live akin to a simple cowboy-esque lifestyle that has long since died. Benicio Deltoro is great as the cold elder brother figure to the younger and more passionate Ryan Phillepe. Juliette Lewis sheds here drugged out naivete persona whe have come to know from her parts in Strange Days, Natural Born Killers, Kalifornia and such, and becomes a more independent yet scared and conflicted mother-to-be.

Both movies feature quite a few plot twists and interesting, if flawed, characters.  The primary difference is Way of the Gun focuses more on straight action than The Usual Suspects.  In The Usual Suspects, any action in the film happened quickly, and there was only one extended action sequence.  The kidnapping sequence in Way of the Gun probably lasts longer than all the action sequences in The Usual Suspects combined.That's not to say that Way of the Gun is not an intelligent flick with its own merits.  There is more humor than The Usual Suspects, even if much of the humor focuses on the ridiculous actions of the characters under stress. I thought the relationship between Ryan Philippe and Benicio del Toro was fascinating.  For almost half of the movie, they never spoke to each other, communicating with each other via facial expressions and body movements. There is also a scene where the situation the main characters find themselves in is paralleled to the rules of Hearts, and while it isn't subtle, it is very effective.Overall, the acting in the movie is first-rate, the dialogue on the mark, and the action sequences are fine, if fairly standard.  My main complaint is the major twist in the plot is revealed far before the end.  After that twist is revealed, the movie pretty much becomes a straight action flick.

First, it's the directorial debut (and written by) Christopher McQuarrie, Oscar-winning writer of The Usual Suspects. Usual Suspects is one of the greatest movies ever (I think) and it was incredibly successful considering the director and writer had basically no experience. So where could McQuarrie go from there? He'll probably always be labeled as The Usual Suspects Guy. If you've seen the Usual Suspects, its almost impossible to fully appreciate Way of the Gun, because you're always thinking, It wasn't as good as the Usual Suspects.The truth is though, that Christopher McQuarrie made a really good movie. He refuses to conform to the status quo and make his criminals sympathetic characters; no noble-criminal bull, Parker and Longbaugh are totally worthless human beings without a single redeeming characteristic. The acting is good (Juliette Lewis is especially great as the pregnant woman). While this is not the first-ever kidnapping-gone-wrong movie ever made, it does treat the material in a new way. McQuarrie also shot the movie very well, and much of it has the visual qualities of a Western (harsh lighting, bright sunlight, gritty desert landscape, etc). The plot is a little hard to follow at a couple points, and the ending is a little unclear. For the most part, the writing is great, but there just wasn't enough of it. (A good part of the movie is a huge action-packed finale that doesn't really use dialogue.)And even though the individual aspects of it were done well, they were sort of floating around, disjointed. The movie was lacking something to bring it all together a defining characteristic that leaves a distinct impression with you as you exit the theater. The best movies have this. For Pulp Fiction it was the absurdity of everything, for The Usual Suspects it was the Keyser Soze revelation. I don't think McQuarrie's heart was really in this.17/20P.S. If you liked Way of the Gun, I highly recommend Reservoir Dogs.

The characters are so one-dimensional it will drive you insane, and they are constantly dropping little tidbits from their past that never pay off in the end.  This film has way too many characters (none of which are good guys) and the plot is way to thin.  At the end of this very disappointing film, you will be asking yourself a lot of questions, such as who was that guy?, and what was the deal with that scene?.

Del Toro is an unusual presence, brooding and silent, somehow pulling your attention to him through the movie with his James Dean-like indifference. This guy has star written all over him. Lewis is similarly magnetic, although perhaps not given as much to do as she could have been.The weak points of the movie are its unnecessary length and some drawn-out scenes involving the doctor and his father and the two bodyguards. In one or two of these, I was struck that the dialogue was somewhat unrealistic, and was made too well aware that the only reason the characters were yammering on as they were was so that the audience would understand the movie's plot. Some well-placed trimming by an editor would have been  helpful here (do we really care what the young doctor did back in Baltimore? Yet we have to hear about it three or four times).Put together, this movie came across as uneven, but I liked some elements of it and would recommend it.

I loved The Usual Suspects, the trailers for this one made it look like it was going to be outstanding, and all of the Tarantino comparisons had me really excited since he seems to have fallen off the face of the earth.Then, the movie began.  The first ten or fifteen minutes were phenomenal, and I really thought that I was in for an exciting two hours.  Once Juliette Lewis was introduced, however, things went downhill.  Two hours of Juliette Lewis whining, crying, screaming, and holding her belly and attempting to walk are too much for anyone to handle.  I couldn't get a grip on what this movie was trying to be -- action/adventure?  sympathetic tear jerker? violent?  deep?  introspective?  It was a flat out mess.There is lots of action, but none of it held my interest.  This movie seemed to be a rip off of every other movie of this genre that I've ever seen. Many sight gags and funny moments, but that can't save this movie.  There was nothing new or exciting going on here, just the same thing we've seen over and over and over again.  It tries to be deep, which is a major mistake because no one can pull it off.  The final shootout was reminiscient of the Wild West Show at Universal Studios.  Honestly, it was that terrible.To compare this movie to a Tarantino flick is a complete insult to Tarantino.  The dialogue is forgettable, the action embarrassing, and the plot seriously lacking.  And did I mention boring?  I looked at my watch many times hoping that this movie was reaching the end, which it did eventually.  And it didn't get any better.  This is NOT The Usual Suspects, so don't walk in expecting to be captivated for two hours.  The characters weren't built up enough to invoke any type of sympathy or likability.  The plot was just stupid and predictable.My views don't seem to be the majority here--I'm actually surprised how many people seem to like this movie.  The crowd that I saw it with was loudly venting their disgust on the way out of the theatre.  I'm seriously disappointed, because I normally really like this type of movie.

Thanks to the surround sound, the frequent gunshots resounded off the walls too many times, making it even harder for me to enjoy a movie with an already weak plot. Benicio Del Toro and Ryan Phillippe star as two kidnappers of a surrogate mother, Juliette Lewis, carrying the son of a filthy rich couple. Oh yes- it is implied that Del Toro's and Phillippe's characters are gay. This is just one detail of many that are completely unnecessary, but are thrown in to spice up the bland storyline. Other tidbits include an extramarital interracial affair and the beginning and concluding pseudo-religious-cum-moral-cum-intelligent monologues by (who else?) Hollywood's favorite pretty boy, Ryan Phillippe.The storyline seems basic, but becomes increasingly complex as more characters enter the scene. And unfortunately, the new characters are all old men, so I could not tell one apart from the other. Therefore, I was left only more confused. Do not be misled by the words complex storyline. That does not mean more interesting. It simply means a more muddled plot, which stays boring for the entire duration. Perhaps if the acting were better, 'The Way of the Gun' would have held more of my interest. Del Toro delivers a decent performance with a brooding depravity, but his partner fails to convincingly play the role of a criminal. His bad boy goatee was thus grown in vain, although those diehard Phillippe fans who will constitute the majority of the audience will undoubtedly find him attractive enough to continue watching the movie.I concede that there are a few good points, but only a few. The photography is better than it is in most action films, with certain scenes tinted with an almost artistic quality. The eclectic songs on the soundtrack- classical one minute, Mexican banjos the next- provide a welcome relief during those rare moments in between gunshots. But aside from these minor points, I advise you not to see this movie. That is, unless you are one of those aforementioned Phillippe fans, or an octogenarian, or someone who delights in bloodshed, car chases, and, of course, guns.

In the beginning of the film, we learn that they earn their money by means of donating uh, well, their fluids and blood. While in a sperm bank, the pair find out that a surrogate mother, Robin, of a rich couple is conducting her usual check up with her doctor. With that Longbaugh and Parker kidnap Robin and place a ransom on her.Anyways, the movie contains some of the most exciting gun-fight sequences. Sadly, that's the only positive thing I have to say about the movie. The scenes in between the flying bullets were long and boring. I felt that some of the conversations between the characters were superfluous and would be better if some of it were edited out. With a title like The Way of The Gun, one would expect the movie to be high on the action meter and less on the banter. A lot of the characters were two dimensional. The average performances from the actors (except for Lewis doing her usual psycho role) made it a lot worse. I can only recommend this movie when it comes out on video.

The film stars Ryan Phillippe and Benicio Del Toro who kidnap a pregnant woman played by Juliette Lewis. James Caan demands that the child be delivered safely but he is hiding a secret. His son is Lewis's doctor who apparently got into trouble in Baltimore and owes Caan more than a few favors. Intriguing setup derails into gory violence. Director Christopher McQuarrie delivers on the action but never finds an emotional core. Phillippe and Del Toro are constantly in the midst of violence but they display no sense of human worth. Lewis is doing little more than be a waiting pregnant woman. Caan is given his umpteenth gangster role that has plagued his career since The Godfather, and rarely can these roles match what that film played out.

'The Way of the Gun,' writer and director Christopher (The Usual Suspects) McQuarrie's crime-heist thriller unfortunately may never be accepted as a true classic for a number of reasons.It was such a superior film that it didn't have any worthy competitors, it was way too intellectual for mainstream audiences and the classics it was reminiscent of were the low-key off-mainstream B-movies no one without an outstanding knowledge of film would know of. Simply, this film is here to be appreciated by whoever will take a chance on it and those lucky few will strike gold.Two mismatched petty crooks - Mr Parker and Mr Longbaugh - live life on the road doing what they have to do to survive on the bare necessities but as Mr Parker states at the beginning of the film' need is the ultimate monkey. Tired of finding ways to make easy money to provide for their needs, they happen upon a pregnant woman in a small town who seems to be the surrogate mother for a very wealthy man and his wife and decide it's about time they pulled off one most daring plan which would set them up for a long time.Staging a kidnapping and coming face to face with the surrogate mother's bodyguards, the plot explodes forth like a river through a bursting dam and suddenly the two petty crooks find themselves in over their heads as the expectant father turns out to be one of America's most powerful and dangerous crime kingpins.Enter Joe Sarno (Caan), a veteran Bag Man who has served the kingpin all his life, helping to protect his business and his finances. An old survivor who is as wise as he is guilty and who is intent on doing everything within his power to get the mother and her baby back with no collateral damage, with not a dollar less.As Sarno sets his sights on the two crooks and assesses the increasingly taut situation, the realisation that it could either be the making or complete destruction of everyone involved dawns over each single player involved and so begins a race against time as numerous secret agendas begin to rear their ugly heads.McQuarrie's film has everything audiences between the ages of 18 to 60 would appreciate; I say that because 'Way of the Gun' is not only reminiscent of violent '70's modern-day western crime thrillers, it features the kind of characters associated with those old classics and even features two of the era's most familiar faces, James Caan and Jeffrey Lewis to jog the memory.It is abusively funny and its general sense of humour is sly, if not just grim. The film's subtext skims across issues such as age and discontent, suicidal tendencies and what people will do for personal gain or merely to survive and the many reasons why. Its dramatic scenes are slowly unveiled, perfectly performed and so well timed.The cast is a powerful and heavy-set ensemble with Benicio Del Toro slinging his heavy acting weight around at will as a quiet but cunning criminal. The scenes between Longbaugh and Sarno are ingeniously fraught with charismatic cool and tangible tension and intimidation.And Ryan Phillipe admirably man-handling an assumed case of severe miscasting as his sensitive and misunderstood partner in crime; all his teenage dramas and tacky horror film roles are gladly thrown aside as he becomes a boy grown up too fast and clearly damaged by the things Parker has seen and done in his short and miserable life.Some very tense action scenes are executed finely and purvey a realistic sense of danger. To see the film go from edgy urban gunfights and car chases to all-out western-style stand-offs in the desert completes the picture and simplifies the general motive, allowing the plot to thicken of its own accord but rather than be all about gunfights and motives, the film delves deep into the desperate lives of its characters as time quickly runs out.By the end of the film, you've been through a roller coaster of human emotion, danger, abuse, intimidation and desperation and every single character has gone his or her own way, manipulating the issue for the sake of their own secret agendas. After all, the prize - fifteen million dollars - is not just fifteen million dollars. It's a motive with a universal adaptor! Because of 'Way of the Gun's almost impenetrable plot, its originality, wisdom and fast paced, hard hitting action, you will appreciate this film more and more every time you watch it. It belongs in every self-respecting film lover's favourites collection!

But in the case of a special few like 'Millers Crossing' or 'Glengarry Glen Ross', these movies are truly amongst the leaders and very best in their field, to the point that as soon as the credits roll, you wonder how the hell you've never watched this before or why it didn't make greater box office or claim any major awards.The Way of the Gun is like the bastard child of a Western and a Gangster flick, holding many of the attributes of both genres and belonging to neither in whole. It centres around two wayfaring career-criminals who stumble into a kidnapping that leads to a great deal more than they bargained for. Every character in this film has game, everyone brings something motivated to the table with a twisted angle or a revelation. This movie oozes cool in almost every scene with Benicio Del Toro leading that emphasis with inspired panache! Ryan Phillippe has never performed this well again and both James Caan and Taye Diggs excel in their roles.

Everything from the well paced, unfolding plot and the riveting chess-like gun-play to the awesome musical score that hits the nail on the head like Elmer Burnstein's Magnificent Seven or John Williams's Superman theme.

There doesn't seem to be any middle ground. It could have benefited from some minor editing to help with the pacing, but I love the dialogue and characters so I can forgive this flaw.Parker and Longbaugh are drifters and petty crooks, although they appear to have served in the military as judged from their training. While donating sperm for money, they overhear a doctor gossiping about a woman who is being paid $1 million to carry a wealthy couple's child to term. They quickly hatch a very poorly thought out plan to kidnap her and hold her for ransom.The attempted kidnapping is ultimately successful only because the woman is trying to get away from the icy bodyguards who escort her everywhere she goes. After taking her, Parker and Longbaugh encounter one unforeseen complication after another. The wealthy patron who is the father of the unborn child brings in a bag man to adjudicate the entire situation, and Parker and Longbaugh are hamstrung by their own incompetence.This is a talking heads movie punctuated by a few brief action scenes, and luckily it is populated by a great cast. Benicio del Toro and Ryan Phillipe are very good in this film, which is half of a surprise. Who knew that Phillipe had the range to pull this off? Juliette Lewis is, well, Juliette Lewis, as she sympathetically portray's Robin. James Caan nearly steals the movie as Joe Sarno, the bag man. There are a lot of great character actors at work, in fact there are too many to name. The dialogue is occasionally over written and writer / director Chris McQuarrie over indulges himself in the way these scenes play out. That said, there are a lot of beautifully crafted scenes in the film. The plot is really about the various family relationships that are slowly being revealed, and culminates with a surprising revelation about Joe Sarno's connection to Robin.I love the metaphor used during the game of hearts speech, as well as the compassion that the two kidnappers show for their hostage. I love that the bodyguards are plotting against their boss in his own kitchen, while his scheming wife eavesdrops. Joe Kraemer delivers a beautiful orchestral score, and I particularly enjoyed the music which accompanied the ultrasound viewing. The piece of music which accompanied Sarno's receipt of the money was the other highlight in the film. One reviewer asked why the score was so prominent here I will opine that it's because the scene sets up the final act wherein the characters' fates will be decided.I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Sarah Silverman's hilarious and profane diatribe during the opening scene, which leads to a fight where Parker and Longbaugh are left bleeding on the ground. It's an image that bookends the film. I will also compliment McQuarrie on the fantastic weapons handling from all of the actors. Apparently his brother is a Navy SEAL, and he trained all of the actors. That man should become a full time technical adviser. We see Parker and Longbaugh use a perfectly executed bounding overwatch to break contact and escape the first failed kidnapping attempt, as well as outstanding room clearing skills and even a 'rolling T' when they sweep through the brothel. They also perform tactical reloads, weak hand magazine exchanges, and immediate action drills like complete pros. Very, VERY few films display this degree of technical accuracy, so for me it's noteworthy.If you enjoy hard boiled dialogue and gritty realism, and you can enjoy a relationship based drama, then you probably already love 'The Way of the Gun.' It's a shame that it wasn't more commercially successful, because I'd love to see McQuarrie make another film like this.

They are not simply stoic action figures, nor are they a wisecracking Mamet- or Tarantino-ized set of partners in crime. They are a distillation of greed and its adoption of senseless violence. They are completely self-driven, greedy, senseless and content to be so, yet we invest ourselves in following them as protagonists because we identify with their feelings of basic need Survival, thus money, thus violence. Writer-director Christopher McQuarrie doesn't even bother to make any effort whatsoever to ingratiate them to us, but in fact the very opposite. We don't want your forgiveness. We don't want your absolution. We will not accept your natural order.There is an obvious but charming symbolic counterpoint to the two main characters in the implicit bond of the bodyguards played by Taye Diggs and Nicky Katt. We are given just as omniscient a probing of these two as of Phillippe and Del Toro, only they seem to come from more affluent society. They may have a more affected look and vernacular (spare though it may be) than the two thugs they mean to dispatch, but they suggest that the troublemaking self-preservation gene is innate. Which pair overpowers the other is a matter of who has less to lose. The result of their actions, and their crossing paths, is an Old West lifestyle wreaking havoc on the modern day. Joe Kraemer's mostly percussive score evokes such a setting. There's even a climactic shootout at a brothel in Mexico.Scott Wilson plays a wealthy man who has made a complacent agreement with his dark side and an underworld economy to afford a comfortable home with a family, no matter how artificial that family may be. Really, it seems no one truly cares about whether or not his unborn adoptive daughter's surrogate mother, played with a persuasive necessity by Juliette Lewis, lives or dies, as long as the baby she carries lives, at least for as long as any one of them feels they need it. Only do Diggs and Katt persist in salvaging Lewis and the baby directly, because it is their job, and the kidnappers Phillippe and Del Toro shot at them. Christopher McQuarrie's exceedingly interesting buried gem, freely sprinkled with the blackest of humor, is permeated with an existential lack of cognitive dissonance on the part of any of his characters. How are the two lead characters morally superior to any other character, or perhaps even equivalent? Why do we concentrate on their intentions? Because they're the ones the movie happens to follow, because they are an unadorned version of what the rest of them are who have put on or been endowed with airs.What does all this mean? Why should we care about the baby due Scott Wilson and his wife named Francesca, who isn't even faithful? She sits comfortably in a high-tech room in her lavish digs as everyone else puts themselves on the line for the baby she's not even having herself. Well, they don't see it that way. Things may work out for her, but not because they care about her or her child by proxy. They have their own needs in line with hers, almost like karma is holding the door for her. Karma's only justice without the satisfaction, muses an older, craggier James Caan, whose character seems to have fully mastered the lifestyle intended by the story's said opposing duos, but only ever seen to anyone else as the bag man. This princess in the castle may not even be touched by the incidents that take place in her favor, but Isn't it how it is, Phillippe laments for more inscrutable reasons. Your prayers are always answered...in the order they're received. "},{"Title":"Violent, gritty cinema. You gotta love it.","Date":"17 September 2007","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" The Way of the Gun is Christopher McQuarrie's modern version of two late 60s western classics, George Roy Hill's Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid and Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch. A complex morally ambiguous movie about two drifters and their suicidal desire for easy money.Ryan Philippe and Benicio Del Toro play the characters nicknamed by Philippe's opening narration as Mr. Parker and Mr. Longbaugh (reference noted). Homeless and unemployed both live on the edge, traveling from town to town and surviving by means of petty jobs. Until a chance, an overheard conversation and they have now set their course on doing something far more serious. Kidnap for ransom. But as they begin to execute their plan, what looked like a simple job soon becomes far more difficult and complex as they have first thought of. The storyline is a web of motives all of which intersect at one position, the kidnap victim (played by Juliette Lewis). As the movie progress both Parker and Longbaugh change. They cannot be defined as good people no one in The Way of the Gun can be except maybe the kidnap victim herself. Yet that which happens to the two leads them to one first and final act of redemption.Keeping with the true spirit of The Wild Bunch McQuarrie explores various themes. Honor, loyalty, redemption, the gruesome realistic portrayal of violence. And as a final cue to Peckinpah's classic, the last shootout in the hotel on the middle of the Mexican desert. McQuarrie throws in his own familiar brand of witty yet vulgar dialogue and plot twists, creating an elaborate film, that gets a bit too confusing for it's own good. Specifically the motivations for the leading characters. As I mentioned earlier they change as the movie traveled towards it's conclusion. In the final act they do the right thing from a moral point of view, what bugs me is the lack of reason for such transition. Yes there were scenes in which Parker showed signs of kindness, but Longbaugh remained pretty much the same until that moment and it looked strange how he suddenly had a change of heart.From a technical point of view The Way of the Gun looks good. McQuarrie directs the film in an utmost realistic fashion, he doesn't use slow-motion for shootouts, nor excessive violence. Shootout scenes themselves were choreographed by a former Navy Seal and look stunningly believable. The acting is tolerable, doesn't ruin the mood.As it stands The Way of the Gun is a very good movie with a somewhat overly complex flawed storyline. It leaves a certain feeling. Like maybe, something vital was cut during post production. Something that could have turned this movie from very good to great.

Kinda sounds like a martial arts movie set in the Old West. Actually, it was a rather strange movie directed and written by the guy who wrote the screenplay for The Usual Suspects. But unlike The Usual Suspects, this lackluster film failed to deliver.The cast was even more diverse than Suspects, if that is even possible. Ryan Philippe, Benicio del Toro, and Juliette Lewis were the headliners, with a cast rounded out by Taye Diggs, Nicky Katt, and James Caan. Caan's performance was the one diamond in this coal mine of acting drivel. He rarely fails to deliver stellar, well-nuanced characters. Taye Diggs is not believable as a bodyguard. He is a model, not an actor. Del Toro gives us his typical one-dimensional character that we've seen a thousand times, and Philippe's accent was absolutely dreadful (watch Matt Damon if you want real Boston). Lewis, typically strong (i.e. Natural Born Killers), was a little disappointing in her role as a surrogate mother for doting multi-millionaire parents.The storyline is basically two cons (del Toro and Philippe) who abandon their typical money-making schemes (sperm donation, etc) to pursue a more lucrative idea by kidnapping the surrogate of a millionaire. After watching the first gunfight (guns galore, thus the title), one really begins to wonder where these two get their skills from. Two cons that have to jack-off to make ends meet typically don't have the elite skills of the top Army Rangers in tactical weaponry. But these two are obviously gifted in S.W.A.T. Remarkably, it becomes even more surreal as these two lead the skilled bodyguards of the surrogate down alleyways in intricate cat and mouse play that even Jerry and the Road Runner would be envious of.A potentially intricate plot is heavily diluted by a poorly written script and even worse directing. I don't think this film is worthy of being in the same review as The Usual Suspects, much less being on its cover. This film was a good idea, but poorly executed.

The break of course, is the kidnapping of a surrogate mother for a very wealthy couple. The success of this film is in its understatement. A lot of the intricacies of the plot and the character relationships are not spelled out let alone mentioned at all by the characters. So much relies on the subtle hints by the body language of the actors. Benicio del toro in particular, McQuarrie has managed to capture a great deal of facial expressions that prove very evocative and effective. This is the outstanding thing about the film; while most films love to be blunt, self righteous, over elaborate, over long etc etc etc, way of the gun is very much an antidote to all of this. The film has a real soul, and is keen to explore the darker side of humanity, equally flippant between savoury and detestable characterisations. No character remains constant in their course on the film, or at least, they are presented as devious and calculating each with their own agendas that slowly drip through to the audience. This adds a lot of tension to the proceedings and creates a wonderful atmosphere. Of course, the performances are brilliant, and again, not overdone.The film is, in this sense, very realistic. The characters are very believable and all of them revolve around the murky grey area characters Hollywood is so keen to ignore. The backdrop is very dramatic; the bleached, faded western scenery and the isolated surrounding lend further effect to the film. The film is constantly referred to as similar to Peckinpah, but really, this is very far removed from the likes of the wild bunch. Yes, there is a western premise but this is a far more subtle film, containing a lot of scenes with no, or very little, dialogue. Also, Peckinpah's films while iconic and fantastic where not all that realistic it is fair to say. Way of the gun's closing gun fights bear a level of ferocity but are intensely realistic. The film also contains a level of poetic contemplation, similar to Peckinpah perhaps or John Woo, but again, its is more subtle.Ultimately, this is a film in its own right; and bears little resemblance to anything else because it is so fantastically original. This is perhaps not a well known film, certainly where i live, but it deserves to be, as this is a real cinematic gem and one of my all time favourite films. I think the perfect way to describe it is  A boiling pot of pulp flavour with a western premise.

Earning money however they can, they learn of a young woman who is being a surrogate mother for a rich businessman. In a violent shootout, they snatch the woman (Robin) from her two bodyguards and escape. When they make their demands though they learn that the father of the baby is a man who handles money and such on behalf of the mobsters and other undesirables. With the pressure on, Longbaugh and Parker find themselves pursued by a variety of men all with different interests and priorities. However it ends, it will not end well.Having already gotten his Oscar, McQuarrie sets out to make his directing debut with a film that, lets be honest, was never going to stand up to the fame of what had gone before. However what he does deliver is a satisfying story in a world where morals and good people don't really exists and the acceptance of violence is as common as the acceptance of the world being round. In doing this the film doesn't make itself out as a classic or a brilliant film that will win over all audiences but it does produce a good crime story with interesting twists, strong dialogue, a good helping of cool and so on. So far so Tarantino I assumed from the start but, where countless others have rifted on this theme, McQuarrie steps back to something a bit more fundamental and a bit more in (as others have said) Peckinpah territory. I found the lack of pop culture to be quite refreshing &#150; particularly after so many ripoffs. This is not to say that the film is akin to the second coming, because it isn't, but it is a very enjoyable genre film in a genre that is easily stuck on repeat.McQuarrie's direction is good. Like the overall approach of the film he is professional and steady and touches of style (eg the momentary freeze-frames) are selectively and well used. The cast are roundly good with everyone singing from the same tough song sheet. Del Toro fits the film like a glove and he works well with Ryan &#150; helping to cover up for the fact that the latter doesn't totally work as a violent, criminal drifter. Caan is typically a class act who does well even if his character isn't as filled out as I would have liked. I found Lewis a bit grating but that is generally because I'm not a massive fan of her anyway. The support cast has solid enough turns from Diggs, Geoffrey Lewis and a typically foul-mouthed turn from Silverman in the opening scene that perhaps doesn't fit the film but certainly gets your attention.Overall then a solid genre film that is delivered in a serious and refreshingly old-school manner. Not a brilliant or perfect film, but moaning that it isn't Usual Suspects is unfair and those that meet it on its genre terms will find it steady and entertaining.

As a modified, modernized western, as a Tarantino-esquire noir, as a follow up to The Usual Suspects, or as a biting reflection on culture, anyway that you choose to look at it, a film like this so easy to allude the viewer yet still put in perspective gunplay before plot is deceivingly becoming a mainstay in screen writing. But before you are too quick to draw comparisons, remember that Christopher MacQuarrie did indeed brainstorm Kaiser Soze, and that his compadre Brian Singer only went on to direct a slew of run-of-the-mill comic book hero series. So MacQuarrie deserves a chance, the Hollywood producers thought to themselves. Little did they know, that MacQuarrie would so soon eclipse every major filmmaker to emerge in the 1990's with one film. Then, what would he do? Disappear, reminiscent of his aforementioned supervillain.My belief is that if you can't find an interesting way to say it, don't say it. -Christopher MacQuarrieIt has become common practice in the past to create an abundance of witty dialog and action scenes high on explosives. It has become so cliché, in fact, that it begs one to wonder whether the trailer for a film is the major reasoning behind the high blood pressure attempts in modern thrillers. I recently saw the preview for The Way Of The Gun, and was pretty startled that despite the awkward moments of revealing scenes, none of the true taste of the movie had been easily transitioned to the montage. Proud, I am, that there exists movies like this that defy audiences, critics, and studios alike.Maybe it's that the true moments of excitement during this cinematic experience were opposite of film-goer instinct. Rather than high-speed chases, overdone explosions, fake guns, and uncaring lines of dialog, we basically get all of the antonyms to these definitions. So, it's no surprise that critics have panned the film so bad. Nobody was ready for what MacQuarrie was to serve with his directorial debut, except the intellectual elite who were so starved that the release will forever be a true cult-classic and Top Ten list ingredient for those wishing to convey a deep understanding of screenplay. It must have been no coincidence that the sites of filming range from desert, hospital, mansion, to Mexican hotels. The first of the latter is rumored to be shot in a town whose Spanish translation is get out if you can. More interesting than the obvious hidden message of the translation, is the comedic element that despite the amount of overexposure of most major studio productions, rumors with so much depth and weight still exist in America.Take a stab at the plans of our two anti-heroes, played with precision by Benecio Del Toro and Ryan Phillppe, and you'll come up gasping for air without ever even stepping foot in the deep waters of the consequential turmoil that develops during the film. The idea is, kidnap a surrogate mother and hold her for ransom. But don't expect the operation to run smoothly. James Caan plays to perfection the bagman that is put on the case, and his more is less approach is reflected directly by Mr. Longbaugh, Benecio Del Toro. Nicky Katt and Taye Diggs are the pratfall-prone bodyguards who make it sort of their personal vendettas to retrieve back the woman they were supposed to be protecting in the first place. Juliet Lewis is probably the least touched by the situation, which runs counter to our instincts that she'd by nature be the most scared. So that's the setup, but to straight-forwardly approach this film would be the biggest mistake made by the viewer. Absolutely nothing is going to work in your advantage if you keep any expectations whatsoever.The dialog is the most refreshing I've heard in an action film, as it breaks the norms of the average Bonnie and Clyde stereotypes, and builds itself in a world of it's own. The main comparison I personally would make between this film and any other would be the classic western Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid, from which the main characters take their (fake) names; Mr. Parker, and Mr. Longbaugh. As in that classic, we are confronted by personalities unafraid to degrade themselves, while still keeping perspective the gold, partially because they have left the path of the good and right a long time ago.Watch it as many times as it demands, before judging the complexities that the plot offers. We have seen enough of the bland and uninspired, that this reversal overcharged with wit and power, should be worth the time and effort of repeat contemplation.It's not what you say anymore.

I fall on the Love side of that snap decision because I have a fondness for quirky characters, well done machismo, visceral action choreography and well delivered, memorable noir lines (such as I think a plan is just a list of things that don't happen.) I will readily admit the WOTG is not for everyone, and I can see why. The movie doesn't really have a single admirable or likable character, even though there seem to be at least a dozen struggling with each other in the film. (The best you can say of any of them is that everyone has their reasons for what they do, and that no one is completely rotten). There are pacing problems - the film is probably about 15 minutes too long. The movie revels in its violence, in fact often it seems to be just another exercise in staging interesting gun battles. And the downbeat, defiant ending will irritate and exasperate many fans of more 'traditional' Westerns and crime thrillers.But if you liked the old Sam Peckinpah movies, and want to see seedy characters who positively ooze machismo and nihilism, this is the movie for you. And there is a quirky streak of gallows humor here which leavens the grimness and bloodiness of the proceedings - little bits of physical humor (especially from Del Toro and a wonderful Sad Sack played by Geoffrey Lewis) here and there, along with moments of unexpected humanity and sympathy (the mother who wants to keep her baby serves as the excuse for most of there) that keep this from just being an R-rated version of Rough Night In Jericho. And every character is given interesting, revealing lines which explicate their reasons and rationales for their (seemingly indefensible) actions, and these lines are written and delivered with real acting chops.Believe it or not, one of the interesting subtexts of Gun is that it does NOT glorify violence. Gun battles are loud, messy and scary; meat explodes as bullets penetrate bodies; people go down and stay down and blood in the dust is enough to make the gorge rise. What Gun does glorify, though, is the matter-of-fact, deadpan professionalism and intent with which the main characters engage in these battles. It isn't bravado; the characters have left bravado behind long ago...it's simply a wholesale acceptance of the consequences of the path they have chosen, I.E., The Way Of The Gun.Especially interesting here is Ryan Philippe, who normally specializes in Tiger Beat Boy Crush roles - with very little change in his delivery or acting mannerisms, he is completely believable as a hard-bitten street samurai, able and willing to kidnap, torture and kill in pursuit of a big cash score...yet able to feel regret and doubt at odd times. His performance was so effective that what I saw him later in Cruel Intentions, I kept expecting him to pistol whip his girlfriend instead of kissing her. And Benecio Del Toro and James Caan don't give a false note in the entire film.So will you like or hate Way Of The Gun? Hopefully I've given the reader enough information to decide for his or her self. Count me as a fan of the movie, and one who admits to having watched the DVD with the commentary track on, twice. (BTW, McQ is refreshingly honest in the commentary, and readily admits and discusses the film's flaws and problems.)

I'm afraid not. Does The Way of the gun contain even something we haven't seen before? Sadly the answer is no. Nowadays they've made a motion picture out of practically every good topic there is. So I guess if they really are gonna surprise with a new thriller, they have to put something new in it but it's getting harder and harder. The Way of the gun is a basic action movie, bit more intelligent than some of them but that's just about it. Still, if you're a fan of Benicio Del Toro this is definitely a movie for you.

It was written & directed by a proved writer and features a quality cast. In addition, the film is touted as a modern Western with two protagonists (term used loosely) patterned after Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (their names in the film were the last names of Butch & Sundance).THE PLOT Two low-life criminals kidnap a pregnant surrogate of a rich couple who, unknowingly, has ties to the mob.The film starts out as a comedy with cussing every other word and then morphs into a serious crime thriller-drama. The score is likably offbeat.Two problems hold the film back (1.) A plot that becomes ridiculously convoluted and therefore increasingly unbelievable, and (2.) unlikable characters, except for maybe the surrogate. Concerning the second fault, I understand the concept of antiheroes, but even antiheroes have to have some redeemable or universally human qualities to make the audience root for them or care about them. Wolverine and Clint Eastwood's Western characters, like Josey Wales, are good examples, as are the antiheroes in films like Runaway Train and Apocalypse Now, two cinematic masterpieces. These two problems naturally create disinterest. By the 90 minute mark, with only a half hour to go, I couldn't care less about the characters, their story or how it turned out, even though I really tried.To the film's credit, it has style and surprising glimpses of depth, but the absurdly convoluted screenplay and unlikable characters sink The Way of the Gun.

Phillippe clears his throat and the ladies take the hint and head for the door.

I thought this should at least be interesting? Del Toro is in it? Yeah, let's watch that.The opening scene is, in my mind, a classic. It shouldn't be spoiled by trailers of people, so I'm not going to.Then the opening credits follow. They introduce us to the awe- inspiring score by Joe Kraemer, who's been composing for movies that are insulting to his dramatic abilities as a composer. The score, at that's no-one but the director's fault, practically saves a big chuck of the movie.The movie starts dragging before you realize it. But it's okay, at first, because of some truly brilliant, it's-like-Mamet-had-sex-with-Tarantino-pieces of dialog writing.There's always free cheese in a mousetrap.Karma's justice without the satisfaction. I don't believe in justice.And, my personal favoriteThe only thing you can guess about a broken down old man... is that he is a survivor. Wonderful performance by James Caan.Then you have two secondary characters (of which there are way too many in this film) Taye Diggs & White-Mexican guy. White-Mecixan Guy is the serious one. (always bad if you remember the name of the actor and not the character - no one says Brad Pitt in Fight Club, they say Tyler Durden says...) Ryan Philippe plays Parker. That name you'll remember after seeing his performance. Philippe surprised me. I only knew him from IKnow What You Did Last Summer, which was more fun-then-freight, and Cruel Intentions, a good and somewhat underrated attempt at modernizing Les liaisons dangereuses. Sarah Michelle Gellar outplays him in that one, though.But in this he squares off with Benicio Del Toro's Longbough. Del Toro I first saw in The Usual Suspects. A whole string of great work followed Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas, a short part in Snatch. that stole the entire movie, a wonderful comedic performance in the underrated Excess Baggage and of course, Traffic. An Oscar well deserved. Del Toro is the kind of actor who always stretches himself in his performances, always doing something new. In this one, he made the wise choice (suggestion to McQuarrie says IMDBtrivia) of keeping silent most of the time. Some of his facial expressions alone makes some scenes in this worth watching.So how come this movie started dragging after a good hour? It was a long wait for a shoot-out-ending which is, admittingly, fantastically choreographed and leaves the viewer with a climax to remember. But was it worth the long wait?The problem to me is that, visually, the film is quite boring most of the time. In terms of lighting, creating the mood, feel, style, what have you that a movie with this kind of script deserved. Now it's just people talking like they're living chess pieces, just there for the plot to take place.There is an occasional inspired shot, especially in the last half-hour when things start to get rolling again. All of a sudden you're paying attention again. Thanks to Dick Pope, D.o.p.Aaron Sorkin, whom McQuarrie could be if he went political, realizes his writing is basically people talking brilliantly and that he needs a competent director to make it visually interesting, fit for a film. That's why he lets others direct.McQuarrie hasn't directed a film since The Way of the Gun, but he is writing again. I enjoyed his occasional fingerprint in The Tourist, a movie I otherwise didn't enjoy at all. Let's hope him and Bryan Singer get together and do a crime movie together again. Until that day then?

It's just too much and it doesn't make the movie a very consistent one either. It therefore all also doesn't work out too original, which makes this movie feel a pretty redundant and pointless one, that you can easily do without.No, it by no means is an horrible movie but it's also not one I'm eager on ever seeing again. It's not really a fun or entertaining movie to watch and it takes itself very serious.A problem of this movie is also really its story. The movie doesn't begin off too bad but the more characters gets introduced in it, the worse it gets. I started too loose interest real fast in this movie. It's incredibly annoying how basically every character has his or her own agenda in this movie. The movie should had sticked more to its two main leads, played by Ryan Phillippe and Benicio Del Toro. That way the movie would had been better to watch and possibly also more fun. Now instead the movie starts giving you an headache with all of its characters and its long dialog. In the end you also just really don't know who is fighting who anymore and why. I can really see and appreciate what director Christopher McQuarrie was trying to do with this movie but I think he should just stick to his writing career. He can write great and also complicated stories, he just can't tell them very well, as this movie proofs.For this movie he still got a whole bunch of well known names to appear in his movie. Besides Ryan Phillippe and Benicio Del Toro, also Juliette Lewis, Taye Diggs and James Caan make their appearances. In a way it's also really an actors movie, since it's often filed with some long dialog. Nevertheless there also is plenty or room for some action, which still helps to spice things up a little for the movie. The action is simply great for most part.The movie never really gets horrible to watch but it also never really becomes an intriguing or entertaining one.

It's a good film, and it's well made, but I didn't really ENJOY it.Two low-rent criminals, Parker (Ryan Phillippe) and Lombaugh (Benicio del Toro), decide to strike it rich by kidnapping the very pregnant surrogate mother for a very wealthy man. Problems arise when they realize who this guy really is. What ensues is a lot of plot twists, double crosses, and plenty of bullets.The acting is solid. Ryan Phillippe continues to impress with his acting abilities, going from a sexual manipulator in the previous year's wickedly clever Cruel Intentions to a thoughtful, if inept, criminal. I didn't like the accent he chose to use, but that's a minor distraction. Benicio del Toro is his usual reliable self. James Caan, however, gives a good performance, but it's too low-key. I hate it how every character in the past ten years has to be low-key and understated. What happened to the energetic, fun movies like Speed and Twister?Christopher McQuarrie won an Oscar for The Usual Suspects, a movie that I also admired, but didn't care for (although for different reasons). This film works better because it moves at a pace where it's slow enough to actually digest all the twists and turns. However, there's no energy here. Call me out of touch, but I think there's a huge difference between an understated film (something that should never be done in a film like this) and a dull, lifeless one.

So why does Tarantino get plaudits, when his films are extremely empty and poor, and this crackling, bloody but far more realistic portrayal of violence get the thumbs down? Well, it is a bit over the top, but so was the climax of 'The Wild Bunch' and it does not seem to have too much new to say (mostly sad, cynical, fatalistic, non-pc musings of a very male leaning), but then Tarantino's so-called hip scripts are vacuous claptrap that critics found cool, meaningful, and of now! McQuarrie really takes up the themes of violent movies and replays them with skill, a bit of bite, but most of all presents us with a far more realistic bout of gunfire where not everybody goes down at the first bullet. So it goes on for the audience, and you just wish it would end, and you want some sort of redemption, but this film gives you neither. It is a satire on the Hollywood manipulation of violence that is basically sanitised, eg the latest Batman. For a clue to this, Ryan Phillippe falls into a dry fountain and lands his arm on a piece of broken glass, which bleeds profusely and he agonises for a long time in real pain, way beyond the usual portrayal of the results of violence. So get it, violence really hurts, way beyond the balletic slomo of Woo, the fifty or so bullets William Holden takes, and the bit of crying that Michael Madsen inflicts when he takes off an ear!!! Love it or hate it - a worthy attempt, if not totally successful, at portraying blood, bleeding and swearing of characters who are not very nice.

The main strength of the film however is the ensemble acting. Ryan Phillippe, an actor I had never taken particularly seriously, is surprising as the one of the dumb crooks.

Del Toro is always most entertaining when playing over-the-top and manic characters, such as this, Fear & Loathing In Las Vegas, and Sin City. The crooks are dumb enough to suit the plot but not too unbelievable to hinder its credibility. The film is easily stolen by James Caan as the cop working on the case and Scott Wilson once again proves to be one of the most underrated character actors ever.

Stylish gun play and shoot-outs along with an unconventional car chase make it unlike any crime- action film you've ever seen. McQuarrie hired a navy seal to train the actors and it shows. They way they move when in combat is exciting and realistic.McQuarrie obviously spent a lot of time choreographing the gun battles because the final shoot-out is jaw dropping.The look of the film is also great. Cinematographer Dick Pope used suede filters to shoot through, giving the film a russet, western quality. It takes place out west and in Mexico, and McQuarrie captures this with the colors he uses in everything from the background buildings to the actors wardrobes.As a writer McQuarrie shines by creating dialogue that is smart, cool, and inventive without sounding contrived and clichéd. James Caan for instance doesn't have to show you that he is dangerous, you can tell by his phrases and the way he speaks. The voice-over that was written for Phillipe is icing on the cake.Beneath the amazing dialogue, realistic shootouts and intense action scenes Way of the Gun goes in areas that most films in the genre don't even touch upon. By exploring the themes of loyalty, redemption, and justice in an imperfect world, it sets itself far ahead of similar movies.Phillipe goes against type after being seen primarily as a pretty boy, by playing a bearded thug and pulling it off incredibly. Del Toro is wonderful as usual, and James Caan is at his best.From start to finish this movie is as the DVD cover describes it, One hell of a sick twisted thrill ride.

The Way of the Gun marked the directorial debut of screenwriter Mcquarrie, whose script credits include The Usual Suspects and Public Access. This shoot-'em-up crime drama is a mixed bag that alternates flashes of character insights, witty dialogue, and absorbing plot twists with an intangible been there, done that quality.  The Way of the Gun bears all the hallmarks of the Generation-X indie-film scene, à la the Quentin Tarantino school of filmmaking. These aspects include intelligent casting that pits hot up-and-comers like Benicio Del Toro and Ryan Phillippe against industry vets like James Caan, a smattering of unexpectedly graphic violence, taut action sequences, an unhappy ending straight out of the anti-hero films of the 1970s, and hip references to cinematic touchstones like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969). Unfortunately, it all feels overly programmed and calculated, perhaps because these projects have become too familiar. Tarantino's ironic, retro aesthetic was a breath of fresh air in the early '90s, but much to this film's detriment, the parameters and style of the genre have become trite, particularly if a film is - like The Way of the Gun - all style and no substance.

To his credit, he has added a number of individually gruesome scenes and touches, for example a man sewing his own cut eyebrow back together, and a ceasarian section in the middle of a gunfight.  The finale is quite spectacular, but how do people in the movies manage to hide so much ammo in their clothing, and avoid so many bullets?All in all, an average thriller, that benefits from a fine opening, and a generally stylish execution.

It is a modern day spaghetti western except that it lacks a 'good guy'.  None in its large cast is in the least sympathetic.  One frequently wonders whether it is intended as a Tarantino-style thriller or an over-the-top, very black and violent comedy, but if it's the former, it is humorless.  It is very stylish and atmospheric which is where it's most successful, and for its many inspired moments, it is worthwhile viewing.

Worst of all though was the shootout scenes. I've never wanted to see someone get stabbed or thrown off a cliff more. The shootout scenes made my head want to explode. It seemed like throughout the whole movie, the volume of the dialogue was turned down, and the volume of the gunshots were turned up. That was the worst part.The film was decent overall though.

His new film WAY OF THE GUN is a hip and stylish thriller that has a mix of a Taratino/Rodregiuz film, and a flavor of a spaghetti western.  There is a great opening and closing for the film that is fun and exciting!  That's about 20 minutes of this almost two hour film, so the viewer has to sit through nintey minutes of a film that is as exciting as a drive through the desert. Parker (Ryan Phillippe) and Longbaugh (Benicio Del Toro) are two thugs who are looking to make some quick cash.  They are even willing to go to a sperm bank.  While at the bank, they overhear a deal that a young woman who doesn't want her baby, and is going to sell the infant to a rich couple who cannot have a child.  Parker and Longbaugh decide to kidnap the pregnant woman, Robin (Juliette Lewis) and hold her and the unborn infant for ransom. The wealthy couple could care less about Robin, but they do care about the child, so they send two of their bodyguards (Taye Diggs and Nicky Katt) to get the young woman back.  However, Parker and Longbaugh are much smarter than everyone thought, so the millionare oil tycoon hires a bagman/cleaner Joe Sarno (James Caan) and Joe hires a associate (Gefforey Lewis) to get the woman and child back.  So the two thugs decide to drive south to Mexico in order to avoid bodyguards, hitmen, and the police to get their money. The opening of this film has so much energy.  I was highly entertained and was beginning to enjoy this film.  Then when the characters were traveling south, it began to drag.  It draged so much that I almost feel asleep.  I was then beginning to hate the movie, until the climax which did pick up the film a bit, and made it exciting again. The flaw is that McQuarrie isn't trying something original like his USUAL SUSPECTS, but he's trying to be like Quentin Taratino and Robert Rodreguiz.  By having hip men carrying guns in the southwest and with lots and lots and lots and lots of dialogue, it's obvious who McQuarrie was trying to be like.  However, Taratino and Rodreguiz at least make the character's dialogue and discussions intresting.  Weither it's about royale with cheese or a barroom massacre at least it does grab the viewers attention and it has something that the viewer can relate to.  But how many viewers can relate to the life of a hitman?  Not many, so it's like hearing two mechanics or two doctors discuss thier job.  They might find it fascinating and intrigued, the viewer is wondering what time it is, how many people are in the theater, or where's that cute girl he saw when he was getting popcorn. The acting, well....if I said it once, I'll say it again, Ryan Phillippe can NOT act.  I was willing to give this film a chance....nope! He failed again!  I was hoping to see that rubber chicken that is suppose to replace the Phillippe character, the chicken would have been more emotional and convincing (sorry Reese).  And Juliette Lewis, can not act that well, unless she's 1.)a psycho (NATURAL BORN KILLERS)  2.)a dingbell (CAPE FEAR) or 3.)both (KALFORNIA).  So McQuarrie tries to have these two carry the film.  Instead they drop the film less than five minutes into their scenes. So who's good? Everyone else, Del Toro, Caan, Diggs, Katt, and Lewis. Benicio Del Toro deserves more credit than he is getting. I liked him in USUAL SUSPECTS, THE FAN, MONEY FOR NOTHING, and FEARLESS and I've heard excellent word that his acting in the upcoming TRAFFIC is phenomenal.  But I loved his role the most in FEAR & LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS, he was both funny and scary as the drugged-up attorney.  In GUN he is fun to watch, his character is calm, cool, and a bad ass like Mel Gibson in PAYBACK.  Both Taye Diggs and Nicky Katt are also enjoyable as the tough, but not too bright bodyguards.  They do manage to do a couple of humorous scenes.  Caan is good, but it's nothing special.  I did enjoy seeing Clint Eastwood films regular Gefforey Lewis again.  He manages to pull off some funny scenes himself as the sucidal associate of Caan's character. But it's the film's pacing and two of the three leads that ruin the film.  It's like eating a well cooked dinner, with spoiled or rotten sauce poured on it.  It just didn't make the film good or reccomendable.  I really wanted to like this film, but by the ending credits I couldn't.  One more note  along with THE CELL , WAY OF THE GUN does have some pretty graphic and disturbing scenes that would make one's stomach twist and turn in sickness.  Why are these director's making graphic ways for people to die? Why don't they show a character's head get blown off, (i.e. DAWN OF THE DEAD) if they are trying to shock people do something like that.

An underrated masterpiece.","Date":"30 October 2008","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" Way of the Gun is one of the most underrated films I've ever seen, and is one of my personal favorites. It was ignored in theaters, and the reviews were divided between those who thought it was a masterpiece, and those who found it to be a slow, pretentious bore. I'm proudly in the former group. This film is written by the same man who wrote The Usual Suspects (who makes his directorial debut here), and though the straight-forward narrative is a big departure from that film, it is just as good. Fantastic dialogue, strong characters who are developed by the actors expressions rather than pointless exposition, and a storyline that doesn't in any way insult the viewer's intelligence. It also happens to be one hell of a good action flick.The film follows two drifters known only as Parker (Ryan Phillipe) and Longbaugh (Benicio Del Toro) who live life on the road, supporting themselves through petty crime. One day, they stumble upon an opportunity to score big money fast. A woman, Robin (Juliette Lewis) is being paid one million dollars to act as a surrogate mother for a wealthy businessman and his wife and is nearly due. Acting too quickly and without the necessary information about who exactly they're crossing, Parker and Longbaugh kidnap Robin in a hail of gunfire, evading her two shady bodyguards (Taye Diggs and Nicky Katt). They realize too late that the intended father of the unborn baby is a money launderer for some very bad people and can't pay the unreasonably high ransom without putting his own life at serious risk at the hands of his employers. The man dispatches his designated problem solver (James Caan) to clear up the situation as neatly as possible. However, the secret loyalties, and the hidden, often sinister motivations of everyone involved quickly sends things spinning violently out of control.Way of the Gun opens with a bang and continues for an action-packed twenty minutes before slowing down and taking time to focus on the characters and the plot. The middle hour of the film is what lost many viewers. This section of the movie is very quiet and subtle, revealing many deep character traits in the least-contrived manner you'll see in an action film. The dialogue is incredibly realistic, and in no way dumbed down to explain things clearly. The characters know what they're talking about, and they actually communicate with other characters as opposed to the audience, which gives the film an often voyeuristic feel. The viewer absolutely must pay attention to everything said in the film or they will be completely lost as to what is happening and why. Many plot twists occur. Aside from Parker and Longbaugh, nobody is who they appear to be, and everything is far more complex than it appears on the surface. The final, and possibly strongest act of the film is where things really speed up, and the film becomes in exercise in pure mayhem. Bullets fly in all directions, loudly and frequently and the blood flows freely. The gun battles in this section are among the biggest highlights of the film. They are loud enough that you could put the film on mute and still probably hear the shots clearly, and the choreography is fantastic. Unlike most action films, this movie doesn't over-stylize it's action sequences. There is no slow motion or MTV-style editing. The action is as realistic as any film I've seen in recent memory. Also, if you can't stand the sight of blood, DO NOT see this film. The third act is about as violent and bloody as a film can be without being slapped with an NC-17 rating. Standout scenes include a gory, wince-inducing moment involving broken glass, and a horrific field surgery sequence that takes place in the middle of the seemingly endless hails of gunfire. This isn't cool, Tarantino-style violence. The violence here is gritty, brutal, and in-your-face.The cast does a wonderful job at bringing the script to life. Since most of the dialogue is plot-related, the characters true personalities are brought out by their subtle actions. Ryan Phillipe and Benicio Del Toro give their characters, who have little background info, flawless chemistry. They communicate with their looks more often than their words. Taye Diggs gives his character the perfect amount of coldness, and James Caan stands out as a man who emotionally speaking, secretly has more at stake than anyone else in the story and his character is probably the most interesting out of all of them.Way of the Gun will divide viewers, and one has to pay close attention to catch everything. When people aren't getting killed left and right, the film becomes slow-paced on a level that many will find maddening. However, those looking for something that won't insult their intelligence will find everything they could possibly want in a crime picture. I found this to be a truly exhilarating experience, and one that any fan of film should check out. 10/10.Way of the Gun is rated R for strong violence/gore, language, and some sexuality.

However, for the normally totally predictable and plot less US-American fare even a tiny bit of story as in this film is a very welcome change. Humour or a even a lighthearted moment to allow the audience an emotional break are sorely missing. Or maybe the characters are really supposed to be that uncool? The gun action is done in quite a realistic manner, but filmed somewhat deficiently.

The Way of the Gun is a thoroughly plodding, bumpy, uneven ride into the crime film genre that effectively confuses and makes little use of it's cast formidable acting talent.It's funny how an obviously detail-oriented writer like McQuarrie could offer up such a convoluted plot two petty criminals (Del Toro and Phillipe) kidnap a very pregnant surrogate mother (Juliette Lewis) to a criminal couple whose two hired guns (Diggs and Nicky Katt) care about their job so much they'd rather die than lose.  Also in the foray are  James Caan as the couple's other, older, wiser hired gun, and the father's brow-beaten son (Dylan Kussman), both of who have ulterior motives for their involvement with Lewis.  Or something.  Suffice to say, the plot's reminiscent of the Coen brothers without the dark humor or clarity.Though the movie starts with a crackling scene of humor, tension, and violence between Del Toro and Phillipe and a loud-mouthed girl, that's about as amusing as the whole film gets.  What it promises in the first scene never really resurfaces in the entire film.  There's little wit to this tale that offers up some splashy shootouts, but little else. As the pair of inept criminals, Del Toro and Phillipe lack the chemistry necessary to be a threatening presence.  When they're alone on screen, they shine, but once they try to seem as a potent pair, their intensity dwindles.  James Caan also seems misused here, attempting to offer originality in a role recycled from so many other crime films a veteran of the game who knows its tricks inside out and attempts to be philosophical.  Doesn't McQuarrie know this has been done much better in other movies and to death overall?  Lewis is believable as the pregnant girl stuck in the middle of the debacle, and as the determined bodyguard, Diggs probably turns in the best performance, yet it, too, is bogged down by a meaningless scene of intimacy with the wife of the aforementioned couple.With Way of The Gun, McQuarrie has served up an array of forgettable, unlikeable, and unredeemable characters in a bloated, unfocused script.  In the final moments of the flick, Phillipe's character sighs in a bored tone, We don't ask for forgiveness.

Now, McQuarrie steps up to the plate, not only writing, but also directing this film, The Way of the Gun. The previews for this movie make it look like fairly fluffy entertainment. The combination of pop songs with the funniest-looking bits from the film make it appear to be a buddy pic/action-comedy. The Way of the Gun, however, is actually one of the darkest, most joyless crime films I've seen in a long time. (The misleading nature of the preview is clear from the one scene that usually caps it off. Ryan Phillipe, running across a courtyard somewhere in Mexico, fires his shotgun and then runs for a fountain - on top of which is a huge bag of money. The preview then blacks out, and he is heard screaming. The assumption is that he simply hurt himself because he's an uncoordinated fool. Typical action slapstick. In fact, the only reason he's screaming is because the bagmen he and his partner are shooting it out with have filled the inside of the empty fountain with piles of broken glass. Not really very funny.) I won't go into the plot in much detail, since anyone who's seen the preview has a pretty good idea of what goes down in the film. The biggest problem with this film is that there's a comedy inside it that seems to want to get out. The situations are ludicrous enough, so why can't writer/director McQuarrie let us laugh at them occasionally? The actors all do their best with the material - James Caan and Benicio Del Toro are both very good, and even Ryan Phillipe, who hasn't proved himself as an actor yet, isn't too bad - but for most of the film they are given no credible dialogue, and their characters are all woefully underdeveloped. There are a lot of movies running around in McQuarrie's head - Del Toro and Phillipe's characters, Longbaugh and Parker, have the same last names as the real Cassidy and Sundance, for example - but he can't seem to synthesize them, or even make anything interesting of them. Here's an example of what a mess this film is BOOM MIKES ARE VISIBLE IN FOUR DIFFERENT SCENES! I saw The Way of the Gun on opening weekend, so these shots will probably be edited out by the time it makes its way to video, but still, nothing destroys a film's credibility faster than visible boom mikes. It's not even that the mikes are barely visible. At some points they hang down so far past the frame line that the entire boom is visible. Their movement from character to character can even be seen sometimes! Once, the boom appears from the left and seems to be an additional character, since it sticks around long enough for us to learn what it looks like and how it works. What were the editors thinking?

However, I spotted the score the movie has received so far and realised that people need to be warned. I will try to be as concise as possible but there is so much to vent. This is the single most empty, plot-starved and tedious movie I have ever had the misfortune to sit through. Sporting what appears to be an excellent cast and some incredible (horrifically undeserved) reviews, Way of the Gun promised to be a unique, anti-Hollywood offering that would provide a bit of originality, flair and, dare I say it, entertainment.No, I daren't say it because it offered none of these. Centring vaguely on the misadventures of two would-be kidnappers (Phillippe and Del Toro &#150; what were they thinking? Excess Baggage looks like a masterpiece in comparison) the film deteriorates into a messy attempt at an ensemble piece. One-dimensional characters turn up constantly to water down the already meagre plot whilst simultaneously yanking the viewer's attention from any palpable thread of interest that the main kidnapping theme offers.We are shown from the word go via a punch-up between some vociferous girls and our vicious antiheroes that these two guys are rough and ready and not to be messed with. We're also reliably informed via a sparse narration from Ryan Phillippe that they mysteriously opted out of life. This is as deep as any semblance of characterisation in the film dares to go.A stale bilge of clichés ensues crowned by a tepid portrayal of a dangerous oddball hit-man played grudgingly by James Caan with a stiff neck, presumably an injury incurred by splinters from the prolific abundance of wooden acting.Shamefully referencing Heat's first confrontation between Pacino and DeNiro, Way of the Gun offers us a tired meeting between Del Toro and Caan over a drink where they bond because they both did time once and looked down on their fellow inmates. A bit. They then go their separate ways leaving little doubt as to how their next meeting will conclude.Christopher McQuarrie parades a host of noxious and exhausting seen-a-million-times dialogues that a first year film student would be marginally pleased about having scribbled on the back of a cigarette packet during a particularly dull lecture.Taye Diggs (an otherwise very talented actor) obviously learnt much from his portrayal of a man deprived of the ability to display emotion in Equilibrium, since he reproduces the same qualities here with even less gusto.Benicio Del Toro (an actor who has repeatedly proved his excellence in character study) struggles to depict a personality so steeped in stereotype that a chalked out corpse-frame would provide more intrigue and depth.Ryan Phillippe's speech/confession about praying every night before he sleeps is so chronically bogus as to be dizzyingly vomit inducing. Juliette Lewis does her best as the pregnant kidnapped woman and adds the required level of discomfort to the birth-goes-bad scene.There is no pace to any of the scenes, no characters fleshed out enough to be empathised with, no stakes on which events rest, and no interest to be gained from the results of any of the characters' actions.The gunfight is bland, the reviews promise many, and explosions too. There aren't. Try Open Range if you want to see a brilliantly filmed and choreographed gunfight, with an awesome build of tension and electricity. And I hate Kevin Costner . . .You are guaranteed the dullest, lamest and frankly worst car chase in the history of cinema. Whether this is reactionary, budgetary or simply due to callousness on behalf of the filmmakers in denying the audience every single possibility of hope for a second of worthy entertainment is irrelevant. It makes you actually want to go and watch a Michael Bay movie. Which is not a good thing.The music is seemingly random in intensity. One particular treat involves a rather mundane discussion between a few characters sat around desperately grinding the plot, such as it is, along, and the soundtrack is building to a level of tension that is stopped dead in its tracks as we cut to a new completely sequence, related only to the previous by its equivalent level of tedium.I think the main flaw, if one can be chosen out of so many, is that the film tries to do too much whilst actually achieving so little. Perhaps if we were allowed to meet and get along with the main characters without every single walk-on part having to have an angle, even down to the middle to old age hit men in the final shoot-out, we could enjoy the movie for the simple kidnapping caper that it is. But with the tawdry wrap-around of pretentious self-indulgent dialogue and need to ascribe painfully transparent individuality to each scene, event and character we are denied any spirit or heart to connect with.Kudos and therefore the extra star go to a film that causes me to rant and vent so vehemently.Plus, I've shot myself in the foot now because you'll probably want to see how awful a film can be anyway.

Obviously inspired by the post-modern rampage of Quentin Tarantino, the director and screenwriter, Christopher McQuarrie, is much more interested in blood and guts than relying on his own story to carry the picture. I like action movies and The Way of the Gun bored me from beginning to end. I also like when action films happen to pick up the characteristics of generally smarter movies. I saw, heard, and felt no wit while watching The Way of the Gun. What a mess.The movie is raw and brutal and contains a fair emount of fierce energy, but to what good measure? Benicio Del Toro and Ryan Phillippe play the typically inept criminals who manage to kidnap a surrogate mother (Juliette Lewis) and more or less hold her for ransom. They travel past the border into Mexico where all hell breaks loose. The pregnant woman's child belongs to a powerful crime lord who is eager to have his child returned to him. Enter James Caan in a suitably uncomfortable role as the laundry man who tries to return the woman. The problem is that she doesn't want to be rescued. Many gritty Mexican shoot-outs follow. The movie obviously takes some inspiration from John Ford's The Searchers and Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver with its reluctant heroine subplot. In The Searchers the point that the girl didn't want to be saved from the ruthless Indians was less subtle than in Taxi Driver, which delivered the message more powerfully but yet equaled the other film's greatness (if not surpassed it). Jodie Foster, as Iris, didn't really want Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) to free her. Lewis does not want to be liberated in The Way of the Gun because she realizes what shall become of her child if she were to return home. This is an amusing moral dilemma but is not very convincing. Lewis once again overplays the screwball nature of her character, inadvertantly creating a strange hybrid of greed and unsatisfying ambiguity.That's probably one of the biggest faults of the movie. We don't give much of a hoot for any of the characters in The Way of the Gun. Benicio Del Toro literally stumbles his way through the scenes with a spaced-out look on his face, as usual, but at least in The Usual Suspects his character had some dialogue and came off, at the bare minimum, as an interesting individual. He's a very good actor but he needs to start expanding his reaches a bit more -- I have yet to see him play a character who looks like he is NOT on drugs.Phillippe did not impress me with Cruel Intentions and he unfortunately did not impress me in The Way of the Gun. The poor casting on his part is another one of the film's major miscalculations. Who in the world thought this kid could act?Prior to crafting The Way of the Gun McQuarrie penned the script for The Usual Suspects, which was clever because it knew how to juggle an engaging and mysterious story with overly-competent direction by Bryan Singer (X-Men). Had Singer directed The Way of the Gun, the result might have been a much better movie. Had some serious casting changes been made and some revisions to the screenplay, I am convinced that this could have been a great motion picture. It just needed a few vital ingredients, most notably more likable and believable characters and less tired situations involving the same-old. What a waste of space.

The film has an unfortunate tendency to lurch from one scene and location to another; there is no overall fluidity to it; despite the fact it is trying to emulate other films such as 'Desperado' and 'Reservoir Dogs'.  'Way of the Gun' just doesn't pull it off.Phillippe and DelToro are good enough leads mostly; Philippe particularly as he plays against type as a hardened criminal.  The two characters and actors have an obvious chemistry; it only takes one look or nod and they are in perfect synch.  Which is probably a good thing, as they are often involved in scenes of protracted gun play - usually with the two mother-to-be's bodyguards (Taye Diggs and Nicky Katt).  The almost balletic dance the two criminals perform on numerous occasions enable them to cover each others backs in the face of overwhelming odds.As can often happen with Writer/Director combinations, screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie has allowed the script to become littered with an over abundance of snappy phrases and soundbites.  All the characters seem to come up with numerous lines that would not look out of place on the movie's poster.Overall I personally became a bit jaded by the constant gun play that seemed to serve no purpose other than to use lots of blood packs and show various gruesome injuries inflicted.  The films score by Joe Kraemer is all-pervasive and is often very intruding on what should be relatively quiet scenes.  Del Toro does the same sort of stuff he has done for his past 10 films and offers nothing new here.See it for the gun play, just don't try and make too much sense of its supposed twists and turns.4 out of 10.

It all seems suspiciously similar to the practice target shooting gallery in the CD-Rom game Blade Runner. But there is one fleeting, intense moment when Ryan Phillipe jumps into an abandoned water fountain to escape the multitude of bullets only to land painfully on shards of broken beer bottles which excruciatingly bury themselves in his arm.

Yes, there are dead bodies - something not shown in typical action movies - and plenty of bloody wounds.Unfortunately, The Way of the Gun exists in the same cop-free world first introduced to me by Quentin Tarantino where the only authority bad guys need to fear are the badder guys.Of course this is a movie, and, despite the director's remarks to the contrary, not reality.As a pure movie and as pure entertainment, The Way of the Gun gives the audience what it wants  plot twists, charismatic bad guys, and gun fights.But it fails to deliver the real world situations and characters it aspired to provide.The director has the characters speak street poetry that is at the same time eloquent(it's done well) and tiresome (we've heard it all before).The story unfolds naturally, with each side (there are more than 2) plotting to gain advantage of a situation where millions of dollars are at stake.The plot, on the other hand, consists of a re-hash of old westerns and crime dramas  shoot outs in whore houses and waiting it out in hotel rooms.The Way of the Gun does show potential of being a great crime drama but lacks the elements of reality that would place it in the same category as Heat.The characters are far too old and scum-ridden to have the cooler-than-thou effect on the audience that made films like Pulp Fiction and The Usual Suspects such hits.And finally, It also can't claim the incredible level of comeraderie that would make it a great modern day version of The Wild Bunch.In the end, there are no heroes. Not even any moralistic bad guys.Just a bunch of guns (real guns - no glocks here) and some really good one liners.

The movie has a good set-up and introduces many interesting double crosses and hidden connections among the many characters as they all wonder how to work the situation to their advantage.

All the various plot lines just sit there and never come together.It's like the director was letting all the actors improvise but they couldn't think of anything. Gritty dialog, pointless monologues, and dull set pieces drag on and on, until you are so bored all you can focus on is James Caan's nipples, which are forcing their way through his tight shirt.

It's too bad that by this time the audience is completely bored with the movie. Most of the audience I saw this with had walked out, and the ones left laughed openly at ridiculous lines like a mousetrap always has free cheese!The Way of the Gun would be a good movie if it was paced quicker, maybe cutting out thirty minutes or so of boring padding. Then they should make the characters interesting and have them say funny or thought-provoking things. They should also invest in a new supporting cast, as everyone but Phillipe (who, despite his terrible performance in 54, is fine here), Del Toro (who should have had more lines or none at all) and the great Geoffrey Lewis are pretty bad. Juliette Lewis is particularly unbearable, as she puts in another one of her trademark repulsive performances. They should keep Taye Diggs, too, but give him a character that takes advantage of the actor's charm and talent, and give the wonderful Sarah Silverman a bigger part than the Raving Bitch (their name, not mine).Then it might be watchable.

A car alarm goes off across the street. A young woman (lovingly referred to in the credits as Raving Bitch and played by Sarah Silverman) starts screaming at the two men who are sitting on the car and set off the alarm. They ignore her. She screams more and more; one of them (Ryan Philippe) yells back something equally awful. She and a large chunk of the crowd move over to confront the men &#x96; more insults are exchanged, particularly some homophobic slurs. Philippe punches her, very hard, in the face. The other man (Benicio del Toro), stomps on the sandaled foot of another young woman. A big brawl ensues. These are our heroes.I don't mind antiheroes. I don't necessarily mind films where most of the characters are criminals, evil people, unpleasant people, stupid people, or just really irritating people. I didn't mind Cloverfield last year which was full of people I'd like to smack. The Way of the Gun though is something different, something on another level altogether. Del Toro and (especially) Philippe are every bit as awful as they start out showing in their first scene, applying to be blood donors for some quick cash but quickly resorting to such insulting behavior &#x96; lots of homophobic slurs again, among other things - that they get the man interviewing them to blow his top, then contriving to kidnap a girl (Juliette Lewis) pregnant with a rich man's baby for which she's to be paid $1 million and killing a half-dozen guards as they make their getaway. They're pursued by the rich man's two top bodyguards (Taye Diggs and Nicky Katt) who figure out rapidly that the old man only cares about the baby &#x96; they have no more compunction than Philippe or Del Toro about icing Lewis as soon as the kid is born.The character who ought to be most sympathetic, the mother-to-be, isn't, really &#x96; she's pathetic, tearful and screaming throughout most of the film, and we never get as much sense of her as a human being as we do of most of the nastier people around her. Of course, in her situation, most of us would scream and cry a lot &#x96; but given that nearly every other character is a murdering, psychopathic macho parody that out-Tarantinos the master, I guess I'd hoped for more. The doctor who tries to help her out is similarly not brazenly evil &#x96; but too weak and cowardly for us to care much about him either. Which leaves James Caan as the older bagman assigned to clean up things, get Lewis back and get rid of the two guys holding her, and he again doesn't register as anything beyond a vestibule for wise and cutting remarks and a potential bad-ass who we know will play a big role in the finale. The rich-guy paying for the baby turns out to essentially be a mobster &#x96; his wife is, like the couple of other women we see momentarily in the film, completely unsympathetic towards Lewis, who is treated as a piece of meat throughout the film by everybody.So it's a bunch of really awful people, and there's a lot of self-consciously cool and hip dialog that I guess is supposed to make us care what's going on &#x96; but I for one just couldn't. It was already wearing quite thin on me when in rapid succession three scenes occurred that crystallized my feelings first, Lewis starts getting down on herself, making out that she's a bad person for having done this (illegal, it turns out) baby-for-money thing &#x96; there's an implicit identification here with her kidnappers, which just about had me throwing up, until the next scene where Philippe is given a sort of opposite moment, tearfully explaining how upset he was at killing a man who was praying for his life &#x96; then 5 minutes later after a shootout in which the hotel they've been hiding at becomes a bloodbath, we see Philippe and Del Toro cheerfully torturing a man and threatening to cut his eyes and pour gasoline on them.At that point I was done, for all intents and purposes. I stuck it out to the finish, which sees our heroes lying half-dead with several bullet wounds in the sand outside another crumbling motel (the location choices are just about the only thing I can find to praise here) as Philippe proudly claims in voice-over that he's not going to apologize for anything to God. I honestly think I would have had a little respect for the film if it had gone to the extremes that I'm sure some of its blood-lusting fans would have liked to see it hit &#x96; if the two psychos had killed Lewis and the unborn kid, laughing and joking while they did it. It would have been even more disgusting and revolting than the film already ended up being, but it would have seemed more honest.I could try to be objective here, and mention that some of the performances (Del Toro in particular) aren't bad; the location work I already noted; and that the direction isn't incompetent &#x96; if I were the kind of person who tried to rate things scientifically and justify every element &#x96; if I were an even-tempered sort of guy who could just say ah, it's just entertainment &#x96; if I were that kind of person, I'd probably just say that this was a fantasy I don't share in, not my kind of thing, and leave it at that. But films do matter, art does matter, attitudes do matter to me, and if this isn't the most misogynistic, nihilistic and offensive piece of sub-Neanderthal film-making this decade, please don't point me to anything that's worse.
