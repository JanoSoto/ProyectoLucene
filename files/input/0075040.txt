Pasqualino is a character whose life is shaped by a shallow, macho, code of honor.  He continually swears to live his life by this code and to force the family to live up to this standard.  He is broken hearted when he must abandon his man of honor image in order to escape hanging.Without his standards, miserable as they were, Pasqualino survives by instinct alone.  His character contrasts with the people that he meets when he is interred in a concentration camp.  Most of the time he is so consumed by a his desire to live that he can't focus on or misunderstands the important things they try to tell him.Although this sounds like a very dour movie, it is saved by the way Lina Wertmuller constructs the story.  It is a non-linear narrative, with a word or phrase triggering a flash back for Pasqualino.The music is extraordinary.  The concentration camp scenes are horrifying (with Wagner opera as the musical theme) and the scenes set in Naples are sunny and beautiful but not overblown.  You see the frayed edges of a poor town, although they're bathed in the mediteranean sunshine.Pasqualino sums it up best when he says, A rotten comedy, a lousy farce . .. called living.  Lina Wertmueller made a wonderful comedy, a masterful farce . . . called Pasqualino Settebellezze.

Although her career took a nose-dive shortly thereafter, Seven Beauties still stands as her best film, and also one of the best films of its era.Giancarlo Giannini gives a compelling and hilarious performance as Pasqualino Settebellezze, an Italian hood who is sent to prison after killing his sister's lover. He fakes insanity, gets sent to an institution, escapes by joining the military, deserts, gets caught, and is put in a concentration camp. There, he seduces his grotesque female camp commander in order to survive. Giannini makes his character wholly believable, and his presence on-screen (in nearly every scene) keeps the story going from one plot twist to the next. His character has a bumbling, comic presence to him, but also a certain amount of craft and sophistication.Wertmuller creates a story that works both as slapstick and anti-war drama. Her direction is tight and controlled, and she doesn't flinch away from depicting the brutalities of Nazism. Parts of the film may seem like forerunners of the gross-out gags that have populated cinema in recent years, but these moments are actually used to show how the Nazis degraded ordinary innocents and demoralized the world around them. The most interesting aspect of the story is the way Wertmuller compares Hitler's tactics to those of the underground mafia; the Nazis, in the end, come off as hypocritical for persecuting Pasqualino for his crimes. Pasqualino may be a slovenly thug, but placed next to even the lowest-ranking of Hitler's cronies, he's a knight in shining armor.

I kept thinking of Life is beautiful and how upset I was with that film. By upset I mean disgusted with the premise. I could not imagine what that film wanted me to. Seven Beauties goes back to the exact same landscape and arrives at a completely different portrayal.I must confess that I consider Giancarlo Giannini to be one of the greatest actors ever to appear on film in any language. His style is different than say Al Pacino, Robert DeNiro or Jack Nicholson. With Giannini what always blows me away is what he can do with his eyes and simple facial gestures. Take for example the scene where in this film he is in court awaiting the sentence for murder. His eyes catches those of a young woman he had met in the street and with whom he does a light hearted bit of flirting. Their eyes meet and entire paragraphs of dialog go back and forth between them and not a word is spoken. I was just dumbfounded. Who acts this way anymore? Just about no one. His style often reminds me of the silent greats like Chaplin (in particular) who had to emote through their faces because the audience could not hear them speak.What is this film about? Is it just an anti-Nazi rant? Not really. Wertmuller at her best, had a full palette of dramatic colors splashing about and this is perhaps her best movie. Pasqualino Frafuso as a character is both hilarious, a complete puff-ball of inflated over confidence, a sole defender of his down and out family's honor and much more. As a bumbling tough-guy-wannabe, he manages to get himself into an insane asylum; perhaps the central motif of the entire movie. He moves from one insane chapter into another. (Major spoiler)...as a survivor, we are not sure what state of mind or soul he is in when he comes back to his family.There is a key element of the dialog mirroring the directors social ethos. When Pasqualino and another Italian soldier witness German soldiers killing (what they presume) are Jews and dumping their bodies into mass graves) and in fleeing the scene the other soldier is gripped with a terrible sense of guilt...we must take note of a key message. Should we turn away when gross injustice is done to our common man or should we protect ourselves with the certainty of silence? The concentration camp scenes are very harrowing but what is incredible in this film is that despite the utterly bleak reality, we can laugh a just a little bit. It is a macabre humor, very black and teetering on a dream like quality. I am reminded of some scenes in Fellini's Satyricon.The German commandant is a woman (most unlikely in real life) and is depicted in an over the top portrayal of life hating, totally unattractive female, who is all too aware that her war is going to wind down and she is on the loosing side. She absolutely hates the Italians she has to incarcerate and she barbarically enjoys killing them at random. That Pasqualino decides that he can seduce her is both comical and very sad at the same time. That he succeeds is beyond his or our own vivid imagination. The one thing he knew for sure was that as a very unattractive woman she most certainly was starved for sexual gratification, even if it must come from someone she hated and loathed. That is the deal with the devil he plays in order to eat and survive. Did he sell his soul to the dark side at this point? We do not get a clear answer and that is another strength in the drama. Wertmuller is telling us that there is always much more gray than colored outlines when we look to define moral limitations, and the choices made under enormous duress. What would we do to survive such hell? Are we so sure we would not lower ourselves to ANY level in order to survive? Many did and that is her point. We are not encouraged to take sides and judge. We are reminded that life sometimes takes over and we are washed away in currents much stronger than our simple moral and ethical compass we felt so sure of as a younger person.Ultimately this film satisfies as a monumental drama on so many levels. Pasqualino's sisters and mother (as actors) are outstanding, especially the eldest sister, who is made to look more ugly than ugly. The struggle to find a place in life with the burden of such horrid looks is held up in a severe way; however, we are also aware that it is over done and very exaggerated. Like some fulsome opera drama, her struggle to find safety, financial freedom and social esteem mirror the struggles of millions of others in the lower, working classes. A very familiar theme in Italian cinema. That her brother, another who felt himself to be an ugly duckling, manages to reach his own level of self-sufficiency, at the cost of hell on earth, ties a very nice parallel to her own travails. A family touched by tragedy on many levels, they miraculously survive the war intact.Seven Beauties is worth many viewings. A richly textured, very well written drama of very intense contrasts, a perfect vehicle for outstanding acting at both comedic and dramatic heights. One of the best films I've ever seen. My personal favorite of Giannini's, equal to or even surpassing his performance in Swept Away. Perhaps Wertmullers most coherent social commentary/drama masterpiece. "},{"Title":"Dark Holocaust Film","Date":"12 November 2009","Score":"5 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, War","Review":" Seven Beauties opens with a strange sequence. Over horrific WW2 documentary footage, a character called Pasqualino Settebellezze recites a monologue, pausing every now and then to say oh yeah in a rather kinky voice, whilst overly romantic jazz music more suited to a low budget porn movie plays bombastically in the background.Sex, violence and self-preservation, these are the themes this introductory sequence lays down, all of which director Lina Wertmuller will approach from various angles over the next hour and a half.The film then unfolds in non-linear fashion. We see Pasqualino and his companion bumbling through a forest. Having long deserted the Italian army, they are tired and dirty, desperate for a meal. It is then that the pair witness a massacre, the German army rounding up a crowd of Jews, ordering them to get naked and then mercilessly gunning them down. The two men then have a short debate. Was it their moral imperative to intervene? Would their intervention have been useless? Is running away morally reprehensible?As the film progresses, director Lina Wertmuller increasingly argues that running away is merely a form of prostitution, the survivor selling his/her humanity for survival. Self-interest, she says, is both human nature and a form of exploitation. Paradoxically, it is this self-interest &#x96; the need to survive &#x96; which causes atrocities and enables bloodshed to continue. Those who run, in other words, support the war machine. Are complicit in its smooth efficiency.The film then jumps back in time. Pasqualino is re-introduced to us a dashing and debonair playboy who has a gift for seducing ladies. He wears a flashy suit, is always well groomed and struts about like a womanising Don Juan. But of course Pasqualino is a fraud, always showing off in an attempt to hide his own poverty. To him, appearances are everything. As such, Pasqualino is obsessed with protecting his seven ugly sisters (the seven beauties of the title), who are so desperate for money that they whore themselves out as strippers and prostitutes. Pasqualino deplores their behaviour. How dare they dishonour the family name! How dare they take part in such filth! This section of the film is thus a sort of darkly comic, domestic fairytale, the younger brother defending his older, quite unattractive sisters, against the onslaught of disrespect posed by everybody in the village. But once Pasqualino pulls a gun on a local pimp (for insulting his sister), the film shifts gears and becomes a dark tale of survival. Pasqualino goes on the run from the law, chops a body into little pieces and engages in all manners of theft, rape and pillage, all in the name of survival. The very man who condemned others for prostituting their bodies, becomes a whore to the world, doing every despicable act required to ensure his continued existence.The last half of the film literalizes these themes further. Pasqualino is captured and placed in a German concentration camp run by an evil female camp commandant (Shirly Stoler in the role that made her famous). Trapped in the camp and fearing for his life, Pasqualino must use his skills as a womaniser to seduce this embodiment of evil. And so, in one long sequence that is as funny as it is gross, Pasqualino flirts, seduces and makes love to the camp commander. The last shreds of his dignity are instantly evaporated.The film ends with Pasqualino in Italy, offering his hand in marriage to a young woman. She agrees, at which point he promptly discusses the prospect of having babies. Pasqualino wants countless children. Why? Because only through them can he ensure his survival. And so, quite despicably, life has once again found a way.Of course on another level, one can also look at Pasqualino as Italy personified, the country selling her soul to fascism in the name of personal survival. Incidentally, with Seven Beauties Wertmuller also continues her trend for inserting veiled (anti?) feminist statements in her films. The piggish camp commander is a jab at the kind of man-hating strong women who set the agenda for female equality by demeaning and undermining others. She's no better than the patriarchal power players she despises.8.5/10 - The Italians made the best Holocaust films. Unlike the Allied Nations, they experienced the Holocaust's horrors first hand, participated in its evils, and possessed the right mixture of blame, introspection, anger and disgust to represent the event truthfully. The Germans, swathed with guilt, couldn't even approach the topic until a good half a century later (until recently, Holocaust movies have come out of every country BUT Nazism's country of origin). Scapegoated and demonized, international pressure coupled with their own insecurities, Germany was prevented from seeing itself as anything other than one dimensional bad guys.Note This film was a huge influence on Italian filmmakers. Roberto Benigni's Life is Beautiful rips this picture off shamelessly whilst Coppola would base his Ride of the Valkyries sequence in Apocalypse Now on the Ride of the Valkyries sequence in this film. More interesting Holocaust films Korczak, The Garden of Finzi Continis, Border Street, Diamonds of the Night, Europa Europa, Fateless, The Last Stop, The New Land, Passenger, The Pianist, The Pawnbroker, The Wannsee Conference, The Shop On Main Street, The Boat is Full.

And so begins a roller coaster of events both comic and tragic that deliver him like so many other young men, into the maw of WW2, completely unprepared to cope with the stupidity and inefficiency of large governments at war, the contempt for both the sacred and the profane, the massacre of civilians unlucky enough to be in the way, the destructions of villages, towns, even entire cities, in short these young men are overwhelmed by the evil that is created from both sides of every war as surely and repetitively as an ocean beach is overwhelmed by the incoming tides.Seven Beauties makes its anti-war thrust accessible like another more famous film, Catch-22, by blurring it's humor into the absurd. When Wertmuller shows us the vapidness of Pascolino's life as he struts around the family business or ghoulishly dismembering a body he killed, I think she is taking a more profound view of human existence than just an anti-war film, by showing us the inconsistencies, follies, and sin that inhabit everyday life, might even be the building blocks of national wars. Pascolino's supposed credo is respect, yet where is the respect in defending your sister's honor, if she is in love with her pimp; of challenging the pimp mano a mano, only to kill him by accident ; of volunteering to fight for his country, as a way to escape from a psychiatric ward; of shooting your friend, to save your own life; of finally returning home from defending your country, to find your seven sisters have become prostitutes? The inevitable question becomes, what is there to respect? Even the representative of authority and control, the prison camp commandant, is swept away by the follies of her own system and the temptations of power, while Pascolino is an Everyman, demonstrating the inevitable folly humankind falls into trying to live apart from God.

The movie is 35 years old, but is so beautifully and creatively made, and mixes horrifying, ugly, funny and touching so perfectly that it has not become outdated and it won't be even after 100 or more years. Wertmüller made the film that both Tarantino with Inglorious Basterds and Roberto Benigni with Life is Beautiful could only dream about. I've seen thousands of movies but I can count on one hand these that made me cry, laugh, terrified and amused at the same time. Seven Beauties is one of them. In Seven Beauties, grim and shocking scenes of war and survival in a concentration camp are intermixed with memories of the protagonist, Pasqualino, nicknamed Seven Beauties of the pre-war Naples, about his life as a petty thief, pimp, and a wannabe Mafioso, and a guardian of his seven ugly as hell sisters' family honor. That's where the irony of the film's title comes from. I must say that for a film with such an abundance of beautiful women in the title, Lina Wertmüller surpassed Federico Fellini who was just as mesmerized with the ugliness as he was with beauty, and often inhabited his films with the grotesque figures. I guess Wertmuller learned a lot from Fellini whom she met through Marcello Mastroianni and worked as an assistant on the set of 8 1/2 in 1962. I also think that only a woman can highlight inadequacies and unattractiveness of the other women so eloquently in Wertmüller's film. The film's protagonist, Pasqualino - weak, silly, but full of self-importance as the only male in the big family responsible for the sisters and their mother, and is ready to stand up for their dignity and honor (as he understood it) at any cost. That includes the killing rather by accident of a man who made a prostitute of Pasqualino's sister... and disposal of the corpse ( here the movie turns into a horror, mixed with the moments so funny that I could not look at the screen and turn off it at the same time. After the fast solving of messy crime and trial, Pasqualino was found mentally incompetent and sent to a psychiatric hospital for 12 years. But Italy needs soldiers, and Pasqualino escapes from a mental hospital, gets to the front, deserts, and ends up a prisoner of war in the concentration camp in Germany which is run by a formidable petrifying never parting with her whip larger than life woman-commandant. Pasqualino had two true talents - success with the ladies and an amazing ability to survive. Would they help him to survive the nightmares of concentration camp and return home to sunny Naples to his mother and seven beauties? The movie is in my opinion a masterwork. Scenes from past and present are connected smoothly and flawlessly. Wertmüller effectively uses close-ups. The script, which she also wrote - is a beauty itself. It is original, witty, gloomy, but not pessimistic, it is a political satire and it pokes on the traditional Italian machismo, it does not shy away from the tragedy of war and the price of survival. And finally, this is certainly Lina Wertmüller's movie, but she shares the success with her Muse or Musus), Giancarlo Giannini . Giannini starred in four Lina Wertmüller's films, but Pasqualino Settebelleze, a small man with a great opinion of himself and seven ugly sisters - is his masterpiece. This is a must see.

He is very much on the run through much of this film.  After all he did murder a man who deflowered his sister.  But then he believes murder is permissible under some circumstances e.g. when the honour of the family is at stake.  As for war, why kill people you do not even know? This and many other questions he keeps asking himself.I happened upon this gem of a film quite unexpectedly.  The title meant nothing to me.  For the first part of the film I was disarmed by a light comedy, so very Italian, about a casanova who had all the ladies swooning.  I was enjoying his antics (perhaps learning a thing or two) when suddenly, captured and thrust into the confines of a Nazi prison camp he became a tragic figure indeed as he tried to seduce (using every known technique)the very brutal Commandant, a fearsome woman to be sure.The horrors of war and the terrible decisions which have to be made to save one's own skin becomes the major thrust of this film.It's a thoroughly entertaining anti-war film with some home-spun philosophy about war and life in general which deserves deep thought by those contemplating any type of warfare.

As we follow the course of this period of his life, we see Pasqualino's character change from insignificant ne'er-do-well into an Everyman caught up in the horrors and inhumanity of war.Giannini portrays his character from start to finish with all the authenticity that he brings to all of his work. As Pasqualino, he plays the clown, the would-be criminal, inmate, soldier but above all a man surviving by his wits and to the best of his ability in the insane situation of war.The defining scene of Pasqualino's spirit takes place during his German captivity as he stands, with hands on head (after refusing to inform on his fellow POWs), singing 'Maria' in his guttural, gritty voice. This simple yet powerful scene touches every heart as Pasqualino's fight for human dignity is clear.Once again, Wertmueller has given us a capsule of Italian life during a horrendous period of history and has made it relevant to us all, for all time.

Let's see - From raping a mental patient helplessly tied down to a bed, to deserting his own country in wartime and collaborating with the Nazis, to frequently abusing women, both physically & verbally, to turning his own comrades over to the Gestapo (who, in turn, assassinated them) to save his own skin - I'd definitely say that slime-bucket Pasqualino was even filthier and more immoral than was the likes of Babs Johnson.Not only was Pasqualino one of the filthiest, most low-down buggers imaginable, but this self-righteous, hypocritical crybaby was also something of an annoying scenery-chewer, as well.With all of the despicable behaviour that came out of this horrid Pasqualino character, I can't believe that 7 Beauties was actually billed as a comedy.

After all, how can it not be when a man has about seven sisters, give or take a couple, and a house full of kids and estrogen? But surrounding this absurdity, and the sort of smooth-operating would-be ladies man but stern-family-man Pasqualino (Giancarlo Giannini), is real danger in the country, and after becoming a soldier following a series of very bad circumstances (murder, a stint in a mental hospital), he also gets thrown into a prison-cum-concentration camp, where he thinks that somehow he can pull out something of emotion from the bloated brick-wall of a b***h-witch German Commandant (Shirley Stoler). This, however, brings on a downfall that acts as something of a purely existential crux he'll have to live with it for the rest of his life- or some form of life he's chosen over the firing line.Seven Beauties is loaded with creativity and an original perspective right from the beginning. I loved the opening montage, where Wertmuller puts together images of Nazis and world war 2 bombings put to 70s progressive rock music and Giannini in voice-over doing some strange quasi-singing. Then the story, unfolding in appropriate non-linear form, has Pasqualino trying to avoid a firing line he and his socialist friend escape from (he doesn't want to escape from it, but Pasqualino does, leading to the ultimate irony in the prison camp). Then something tricky treading the line between making scenes really emotionally compelling in terms of the dramatic conflict- which in true Italian fashion ala Pasqualino's striptease sister, whom he fervently disapproves of- while also adding hysterical comedy on the same level. There's sincerity all the time, but also something of a wink from Pasqualino, at least at first, if only subliminally through his oddly traditional character. Then, as the prison camp scenes go forward, things become (very) dark with the set design being extremely stark and decayed with the buildings and blank look to the walls, and the Commandant, who as played by the scarily one-tone Stoller, a Nazi version of Nurse Ratched, minus the veneer of we're here to help you and replaced with the cruelest form of human connection- pure indifference and contempt that gives fascism its bad name.It's fascism, by the way, that is laced in the cracks in the story, as we see in a scene between the Socialist and Pasqualino, where he can't get his head around the idea that fascism and Il Duce aren't good providers. Behind the real human choices and lack of compassion in this world of Wertmuller's, there's the social framework that puts all these characters into this wretched existence. Giannini, all the while, is absolutely perfect in the role. First there's just the look on his face, his eyes, where early on he's the 'man' of the family, in charge and taking names, though mostly in threats. When there's panic to be had, like in an accidental murder, then we start to see cracks in his veneer of more slick attitude. These become more pronounced in the mental hospital, including a great scene of reaction shots as he tries to have his way with a woman tied down to a bed. By the time prison comes, he's been broken down, and his pleading with the Commandant- who shows next to no emotion, whatsoever- seems all the more genuine, not so much as a con, and it's significant by making comedy in a German prison environment so uncomfortable and bleak. The last shot is key, and one where Giannini's performance comes full fold; this is one where he goes through many emotions, through a very expressive face, ending on a blank. Wertmuller as director is fearless in her attempts to intermingle just little slices of comedy, like Pasqualino's seven beauties explanation. Or as he hums and whistles quietly early on at the Commandant, quietly getting her attention. Even over the top bits with the prostitute sister, or with the little flashbacks to his childhood, it's an honest comedy, that can only come out of a confident director in tone and manner with the actors. And when it comes to style, she has one of the key cinematographers of the mid 20th century on her side (Tonino Delli-Colli), but it's sometimes more subtle than a Fellini, with a documentary approach to many scenes, and an editing style that's a little leaning to the conventional side when not intermingling various images and montages, or cutting to trees to transition. But there are many scenes for movie buffs to remember just in visual terms; the prison is presented in long shots displaying the many souls lost in the deadened atmosphere of total dominance, and specifically the scenes with Pasqualino and the Commandant in her office are lit in a stark green, and later blue, add not so much the characters' psychological mood but just a sensibility of dread and the coldness of it all.In all, Seven Beauties is a disturbing work of of minor genius, and it's unfortunate that Wertmuller is over-looked nowadays as she's one of those rare filmmakers who can tackle the sad truths of people that are faced when there's real consequences to not really being apart of anything except for oneself and so-called family pride. At the same time Wertmuller gets the viewer to laugh at it during the process, be it through choices in music or simply in Giannini, who's got more range than many a Hollywood actor today.

The ones that I find the most watchable are the ones that look at it from an unusual viewpoint--a way that gives us new insight into the wretchedness and evil. My favorite of these is THE SHOP ON MAINSTREET, though SEVEN BEAUTIES is also an exceptional film about the horrors of the Nazis as seen from an unusual man.Pasqualino (also called Seven Beauties in the film) is a slimy amoral Italian man who is totally apolitical and only wants to survive the war. His life, up until the war, is shown in a series of flashbacks. And, he was a pimp who mostly avoided arrest until he killed a man. Then he manages to be sent to a mental asylum and then eventually released to the Italian army. No matter how bad his problems are, this smooth talking jerk manages to survive. However, after deserting (about you'd expect from him), Pasqualino and another deserter are captured and stuck in a hell-hole German death camp. Slimy Pasqualino figures he, too, will soon die unless he does SOMETHING to survive. His plan is to seduce the German lady officer in charge. She is, by the way, the uglies, scariest and most awful human being you'll ever see on film. His sex scenes with her, instead of being titillating are almost comical in their repulsiveness. However, Pasqualino gets far more than he bargains for. He DOES survive, but is made a Kapo--a boss of his barracks responsible for selecting men for execution and even performing one himself! It is a tough to watch segment of the movie--seeing just how far this man will go to save his own skin.The film is a great study in human nature and evil. As you would expect, this film is NOT ACCEPTABLE FARE FOR KIDS! But, for a mature audience, this is well worth your time. Giancarlo Giannini did a wonderful job in the lead.

It stars Giancarlo Gianinni as the title character, Shirley Stoler, Fernando Rey, and a host of excellent supporting actresses and actors. The film got Wertmuller the first nomination of a woman as Best Director for the Oscars. Her use of music and silence is brilliant.Seven Beauties starts with our hero on the lam in Germany, an Italian soldier trying to desert to his home in Napoli. In flashbacks throughout the film, we see episodes of Pasqualino Seven Beauties before the war as a young man with aspirations to the Mob. Through a series of misadventures involving murder and an insane asylum, Pasqualino ends up in the Italian army in Germany, where he promptly deserts. The Germans capture him and send him to a concentration camp. Throughout the film, in flashbacks and in the present, Pasqualino's goal is to live. And he gets his wish. Naturally, much goes on in the years between the Thirties and the Forties, when the film ends. Wertmuller is relentless in her hatred of the Nazis and the Fascists. There is enough polemic in the film to get her point across, but not so didactically that it becomes preachy. Some of the characters clearly have no point but to show the intelligence of socialism or the bravery of honor. But what Pasqualino has to show us is the squalor and degradation of the Nazis.If the purpose of good literature is to show us the development of character, Wertmuller shows it in spades through Pasqualino and his family. The price of staying alive is high.SPOILERS In a flashback the movie shows us Pasqualino, his mother, and his sisters during the Depression before World War II. They live in Napoli, and his mother is widowed, so Pasqualino assumes that the's head of the family. Although they are poor, Pasqualino is very happy. He dresses well, he carries a gun, and he feels respected. His oldest sister, however, is 38, and she feels spinsterhood approaching. She's fat and ugly and has no prospects. She falls for a pimp who tells her he'll make her a star and then he'll marry her. Her goal in life is to feel loved, she falls for his line, and he puts her on stage in a skimpy costume then into a brothel. Prostitution is a metaphor throughout Wertmuller's movie. Pasqualino murders the pimp, disposes of the body, is caught and confesses. Told by his lawyer that his only chance to avoid the death penalty is to plead insanity, Pasqualino refuses, claiming the family's honor is more important. Awaiting trial, however, Pasqualino realizes that life is better than an honorable death, and he begins spouting Il Duce's speeches to his fellow inmates. His lawyer gets him sentenced to treatment in an asylum. Staying alive, too, is a repeating theme in Seven Beauties. Wertmuller realized that one of the genius ideas of the Nazis was to make us all complicit in their atrocities. Throughout the movie, Pasqualino observes atrocities and remains silent over the objections of others around him. Eventually his silent acquiescence leads to action, as he becomes a participant in the murders of those imprisoned with him. While others choose honorable death, Pasqualino chooses to remain alive. It's not a bargain with the devil. It's not a choice we can blame on others. It's the choice of Pasqualino. To live, he has to prostitute himself to the Nazi camp commandant. Seven Beauties is an indictment of the Nazis and all their fellow travelers, but an understanding one. Sergei Eisenstein showed us in Battleship Potemkin that the drama lies in individual stories not in masses, and Wertmuller shows us the corruption of all of Germany through the individual story of Pasqualino. The Nazi path is a 12-step program which leads not to recovery and redemption but to the sickness that was the Nazi party. Blind obedience to the Nazis leads to hell. Pasqualino's wish to live was granted, and the Furies will hound him with the living hell of his memories.After you've seen Seven Beauties, watch Catch 22 and pay attention to Yossarian's conversation with the old Italian man.For serious students, I recommend reading a short article about Mel Brooks at the US News archives where Brooks says you can't take on monsters like Hitler in a direct manner -- they'll always win if you take them seriously and argue their behavior with them. Hitler was famous for seducing his listeners with his rhetoric. Brooks believes the only way to win against tyrants is to mock them and show how crazy they are. Brooks says he attacks the horror of the holocaust with the only weapon that works - ridicule of the perpetrators. Was Wertmuller mocking the Nazis with Seven Beauties?Then contrast Brooks's view with that of Bruno Bettelheim in his essay about Seven Beauties called Surviving. Brooks served in the army in World War II and saw the streams of refugees but not the concentration camps. Bettelheim is, as he put it, one of the all too few survivors of the camps. Bettelheim's view of the film and its comic aspects is one of outrage and disgust. Actually, I'm not sure outrage is strong enough to describe his feeling. He excoriates Wertmuller and everyone who gave the film a good review. I contemplated a meaningful dialogue between Mel Brooks and Bettelheim, but I'm not sure it could have happened, given Bettelheim's experience. He was a professor of psychology at the University of Chicago after his escape to America, and he practiced at a school for emotionally disturbed children. Bettelheim's specialty was treatment of the autistic. Unsurprisingly, he suffered from depression. In 1990 at the age of 86 he committed suicide - he was widowed and suffering from the effects of a major stroke.

Alternating from uproariously funny to deadly serious, this film uses Giannini's life to convey a very cynical message about life and the world. Wertmueller happily subjects Giannini's character to one humiliation after the other in order to make this large point namely, that Pasqualino survives these misadventures (including a prolonged stay in a concentration camp) not because of his heroic or noble qualities (he has none), but rather because he is weak, cowardly, and selfish. Admittedly, this message may strike viewers as very depressing. Yet, Wertmueller's Seven Beauties makes for great entertainment anyway precisely because it is an unconventional, fast-paced, colourful, loud, musical, stereotypical, and action-packed picture where the unexpected often happens and catches you unawares.

Not so with Pasqualino Settebellezze (Seven Beauties). It explores extremely disturbing and sickening ideas that I hate to think about. Unfortunately, I feel that watching it is necessary. It is an Italian film about a man named Pasqualino Frafuso. A soldier for fascist Italy in World War II, he is a despicable but complicated character. I hated him for practically the entire film, although I noticed a hint of sympathy towards the end. Thats not to say he was a bad character; Giancarlo Giannini does an amazing performance as Pasqualino. His postures, expressions, and mood were perfect. After he does something horrible, you can sense regret in his character as he develops. Highly imperfect characters are usually a gamble, but it worked out well in this case.The plot alternates between two phases of Pasqualino's life. The first begins with Pasqualino deserting his army train during combat. After wandering into a forest, he and a friend get captured by Germans and sent to a concentration camp. The recreation of the concentration camp is eerily spot-on. At this point, Pasqualino vows to find a way out of the camp. He faces a grueling trial to gain the affection of a physically and mentally unattractive female Nazi commandant. The second plot line reviews Pasqualino's life as a young man with seven sisters. We see the destructive flaws in his character. All of the crimes he commits as a young man return to haunt him when he is in the camp.The film does not hold back on political or social messages. Pasqualino is revealed as a character who does not think beyond self preservation and reputation, making him the perfect tool. He endorses Mussolini's beliefs just to make life easier for himself. When people with real political ruminations talk to him, he rubs off their ideas without a second thought. He begins to understand his mistakes toward the conclusion of the film, but is forced into tough circumstances.Pasqualino Settebellezze does not fear to explore the boundaries of society that many people choose to ignore.

Several of his peers retain their ideals, refuse to submit, and die pathetic deaths.The film seems to be admitting a harsh truth of reality that life is ultimately about survival and that ideals and thoughts are not important beyond how they influence our actions. At some point they hold us back and we're better off abandoning them.At one point the Nazi female commander laments that the Nazis are trying to make humanity better but doomed to fail, and the snivelling rats who will do anything to survive (the main character) will continue on. This is a good point. The Nazis were idealistic too in wanting to elevate humanity.So the film isn't on the side of idealism or pragmatism. Clearly humanity is a complex combination of both; every person has some degree of fundamental ideals and some degree of flexibility and pragmatism. And there are many different ideals that are in opposition to one another.One of the idealist characters at one point mentions a possible resolution that is popular for humans to turn into sheep. If we can only stop evolution and eliminate violence from the world, we can live happily ever after.The film is otherwise lacking in insight. It's not clear what it views as a resolution. It does seem clear that the film isn't happily embracing the world as it is, give its sombre tone.The film starts out with a montage of stock footage of Hitler and Mussolini set to cartoonish music and a voice narrating some phrases that sound like they're probably insulting. A short ways in, we see evil Nazis shooting innocent women and children in the forest. At one point, the dialogue is set up for one character to defend Mussolini and another, wiser character to rebut all of their arguments and explain why Mussolini was bad. Finally, the characters end up in a concentration camp where evil Nazis shoot innocent prisoners for no reason. Who knows what the director really believes - she isn't telling us - but the apparent heavy anti-Nazi, Nazis-are-pure-evil bias of the film is annoying.The film is otherwise fairly mediocre.

She's succeeded in creating an unforgettable character, Pasqualino, a lovable rogue, and give one of the most cynical and funniest looks at human nature and at Man's will to survive.Giancarlo Giannini plays Pasqualino, a Neapolitan crook who wants to make a name for himself and protect the honour of his household composed of his mother and several sisters. When one of his sisters becomes a prostitute he kills her pimp and disposes of the body in a creative way by hacking it into three pieces and shipping each one to a different city. The inexperience Pasqualino is caught, but the Monster of Naples fakes madness and gets sent to an asylum. Then with WWII starting, he manages to get recruited just so he can desert. Only he deserts in the middle of Germany and gets taken to a concentration camp where he seduces the sadistic Kapo in return for favours.This movie is undoubtedly a comedy, the black, misanthropic type that revels in making fun of everything that's rotten and horrible in people. Pasqualino's will to live to would bring to one's mind movies like The Pianist or Life Is Beautiful, hymns to human hope, if it weren't for the fact Pasqualino is a manipulative bastard who'll do anything &#x96; really anything &#x96; to survive. In a way this movie is also a parody of such feel-good movies. Wertmüller peels down the layers of the hero to show that behind all that willpower, all that nobility there's just a rat trying to survive.Like the Nazi Kapo says to Pasqualino, You're a sub-human creature who'll survive, while we tried to create the master race and are doomed. And yet Giannini, who gives a marvellous performance, never makes his character unlikable. From the first time we see him wearing a dead man's bloodied bandages to fake a wound, to strutting through the streets of Naples like a peacock, to debasing himself before the Kapo in return for food, we're captivated by his performance.If you ever need to remind yourself what a sad, pathetic species we are, watch Pasqualino Settebellezze and marvel how all the lies that hide our true nature are torn apart to reveal our true spirit.

My search for more of his excellent roles led me all the way back to 1975, in Lina Wertmüller's powerful Holocaust drama/comedy, 'Pasqualino Settebellezze Seven Beauties.' Surprisingly, for a foreign title, the film proved quite successful at the 1977 Academy Awards, receiving nominations for Best Foreign Language Film, Best Director (the first such nomination for a female director), a well-deserved Best Actor (Giannini) and Best Original Screenplay.The film follows the exploits of Pasqualino Frafuso, a proud young man from a poor, rather unattractive family. Over the course of his life, Pasqualino has gained a certain level of respect in his home city of Naples. Whilst not particularly brave or dangerous, he possesses enough confidence to convince others that he is, and few people bother him. He carries around a gun for intimidation purposes, but doesn't really know how to use it properly. Thus, despite his less-than-good looks, Pasqualino considers himself a great success, and refuses to allow anybody to tarnish the great reputation that he has garnered himself. When one of his seven sisters becomes a prostitute to make ends meet, he responds violently, his reaction resulting in murder. In order to minimise his punishment, Pasqualino abandons his morals and feigns insanity, before enlisting in the defence force to escape the debilitating mental institution.All his own life, Pasqualino has treasured his sense of pride, but, when faced with death, he finds himself becoming&#133; not quite a coward, but something akin to one. He deteriorates into a pathetic, grovelling, low-life creature, his will to survive outweighing his former notions of respect and family honour. It is not, in any way, a heroic bid for survival; it is painful to watch; we are repulsed; we pity him for the lengths he has gone to. When ordered to randomly select six young members of his own people to be executed, he does so. He puts a bullet in his own friend because he is told to. There are no heroes here; only the raw, brutal facts of reality.'Seven Beauties,' peculiarly for films of its subject matter, is a mixture of comedy and drama, and this gave rise to some of its biggest flaws. At numerous points, the film seems unsure of exactly what it wants to be the bright, funny sequences are funny; the dark, dramatic sequences are certainly dramatic. However, the two extremes can't seem to comfortably co-exist on the screen, as you'd imagine when dealing with events of this sort. As much as my opinion is destined to be an unpopular one, I thought that Roberto Benigni's 'La Vita è bella Life is Beautiful (1997)' did a better job of using comedy to make the events of the Holocaust seem even more tragic.Another point that shouldn't affect my enjoyment of the film &#150; but does &#150; is the fact that 'Seven Beauties' features a selection of the most repulsive women, both morally and visually, in the history of cinema. Giannini, despite referring to himself as ugly at one point, stands as a shining beacon of handsomeness among this crowd, which is not necessarily a compliment. I realise that this was probably a requirement for the film itself to work, but that doesn't make it any easier to look at the television screen. After watching 'Seven Beauties' for the first time, I find myself satisfied, but ultimately feeling as though it has been done better. "}]
