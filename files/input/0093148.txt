I disliked the mushiness, the story and even the sad parts. This movie was stuck on the shelf, covered in dust, forgotten.Only days ago I pulled this movie out and decided to sit down and watch it, expecting the same mushy film that I saw years and years ago.However, as I have gotten older I have a greater understanding of what this film offers me and people alike. In fact, it touched me so much to see how something that is often portrayed as scary was so gentle and caring.From the introduction when Harry is first discovered (in a rather unfortunate way) to the end of the movie, the Hendersons learn that Harry is more human than they ever thought, and that he has a bigger heart than the human race combined.Throughout the film, the effect that Harry has on people's lives is always seen. We as humans are so receptive to myth, legend and rumours. Yet, before the truth is given a chance to be known, we block our ears, close our eyes and run away.The Hendersons, Jacques LeFleur -a hunter who has followed his trail for 25 years and Dr Wrightwood -a man whose life has been ruined by his dedication towards the study of Sasquatch, all gain a new perspective on life, as well as a new respect. Their original feelings of the Beast all quashed swiftly to realize that inside of it lay a big heart.Harry's compassion, love for other beings and respect for life made this film an absolute delight to watch. I whole heartedly recommend this for anybody looking for a family film that not only warms the heart, but also teaches a lesson of who is really the monster on Earth.

It was 1987 and my uncle had just passed his driving test so he was well into driving places and the cinema just happened to be one of them.Even though the film is only 110 minutes long, they still had an intermission halfway through, for some reason. And I swear, they actually had ushers coming round selling stuff before it started back up again. I believe that is the first and only time I have seen such old-fashioned picturehouse practices. But it makes my original memory of this film so much more nostalgic.The Hendersons consist of wannabe artist/gun salesman dad George (that always brilliant John Lithgow), loving mum Melinda Dillon, a bratty daughter and a hyperactive son. On returning from a camping trip in the Pacific Northwest, they accidentally run into some sort of large furry creature on the forest road. Originally believing it to be a bear, George steps out of the car to prod it with his gun a few times. But the bear has man-like hands and George suddenly asks his family 'What if it's...HIM'.Bigfoot! Think of how much he's worth! So they tie him to the roof of the car and drive him home, while George thinks of the best way of selling him. Later that night, he is curious as to how big his feet really are. So he sneaks down to the garage with a measuring tape only to find that he's no longer strapped to the roof of the car, but poking around in the kitchen fridge.The Hendersons stand back as bigfoot (or Harry as he is later renamed) stomps around the house and garden investigating all their strange belongings. Though he doesn't care much for all the animal trophies hanging around everywhere. Freaking out, George tries to snipe Harry from through the bedroom window, but has a change of heart when he realises that Harry is just big, harmless oaf.The best scenes of the film involve Harry making himself at home in the Henderson house. His mannerisms and body language are similar to a child warned to be on their best behavior while visiting old relatives. He constantly looks a bit nervous and uncomfortable but is always ready to grab you for a big hug.Rick Baker deservedly took home an Academy Award for Best Make-Up Effects back in 1988 for this movie. Harry Henderson is an amazing character with a wonderfully wide range of expressions and emotions. All E.T. ever did was sit there looking bug-eyed. Not Harry though, you can't help loving him. I so want my own Bigfoot.Even now as an adult I think this movie is still great. As a kid I remember feeling the panic and excitement when Harry got lost in Seattle and the half-crazed Bigfoot hunter Jacques LaFleur (David Suchet) doing lots of sleaziness in order to have him shot, gutted and sold to science. Forgive the repeated comparison, but to me it was more involving and fun than the man with the keys in E.T.You just don't get family movies like this anymore. Back in the 80's Steven Spielberg's Amblin production company made loads of great family movies like Gremlins, Goonies, the Back to the Future Trilogy, Young Sherlock Holmes and Innerspace. They all had some kind high-concept spin that crud such as Like Mike and Crapper by the Dozen don't.It was a great time to be a kid back in those days. We weren't cynical and jaded and hooked on Playstation like modern children. We still had a sense of adventure, a longing for the outdoors. Anything could be out there. Maybe Harry is actually bumbling around in the woods as I write this. Like the Patterson/Gimlin film that inspired it, Harry and the Hendersons is one movie that will be timeless forever.

Some circumstances are a little unbelievable, and there are a few plot holes, but the movie comes through with lots of amusing sequences involving Harry inadvertently destroying the Henderson's house. Harry himself is a joy to watch - extremely expressive, even for an animatronic puppet that does not speak. The visual effects team did an incredible job on the range of emotions Harry shows, and to this date I have not seen a movie which has had animatronics as life-like as they are here.The chase sequence as Harry gets lost in the city is the worst part of the movie, where the cheese is laid on thick and stinky - for a scene designed to perhaps create drama, it is unintentionally goofy and seeks to make the plot drag unnecessarily. However, once the Hendersons get Harry back, the movie picks up again for the final heartwarming forest sequence.Still one of my favorite movies.

As a whole, it is not an amazing film, but it is a memorable one and had some cultural impact. And Baker's work (along with his crew) is incredible. The facial expressions? Kevin Peter Hall did not have a long career (sadly), but between this and the Predator, his reputation will be cemented forever.Interestingly, some have said this film is like E.T., which is notable because Steven Spielberg was the producer. I can see what they're saying, with taking this foreign creature and making it part of your family. There are distinct difference and E.T. is clearly the better film, but it's an interesting comparison.

Unlike the genuinely good family films of the 1980s, like THE GOONIES and THE MONSTER SQUAD, this reduces the cast to a screaming mess, a bunch of actors holed up in a house who spend the movie shouting and overacting for all their worth.The subject of their consternation is the hulking bigfoot who ends up living with them for a time. While the bigfoot suit is admittedly impressive - as is the sheer size of the guy who plays it, the late Kevin Peter Hall, who also essayed the role of the Predator - the way he's turned into a bumbling, friendly giant is frankly embarrassing for this viewer.I get that a lot of reviewers on here saw this as a kid so have a special place for it in their hearts; I'm the same with certain films despite their flaws. But coming into it as a cold-hearted adult, I'm afraid this is one for kids and kids alone; even the normally reliable likes of John Lithgow and David Suchet embarrass themselves in the overacting stakes.

It's not quite a rip-off, as there is nary a Reese's Piece in sight, but with both an identical message and a similar reliance on fish-out-of-water humor, it's hard to imagine anyone phoning Harry instead of phoning home.To be fair, Harry seems to be aiming more for cute than poignant, and at least in that regard, the film succeeds admirably. The humor is decidedly aimed at the grade-school set, and most of it involves Harry wrecking the Hendersons' house as he adjusts to the discrepancy between his size and the scale of his new environment. There are no big laughs here, but the film is amusing in its own quirky way, and having John Lithgow as the centerpiece of Harry's struggle to fit in a world far too small for him certainly helps with this.Many things about the film don't work, but I suppose that's to be expected. The rather dicey attempt at conflict involves a sasquatch hunter (yep, they're everywhere...) wanting to hunt down Harry and adorn his parlor with the granddaddy of all trophies. However, bringing this misguided big game enthusiast into suburbia is a hard pill to swallow. He seems so intent on bagging Harry that he's apparently willing to walk into the house of a family of strangers and shoot the big fella in their living room. I'm not sure how many people have pet deers, but it's hard to imagine even the most callous hunter wandering into their neighborhood and gunning down their backyard Bambis.The Hendersons' neighbor Irene is probably supposed to be on hand as a comedic foil, but she's far too cloying to be anything but annoying. The fact that they introduce her with the singular character trait of being a busybody also makes much of the physical humor of Harry's wreckage unrealistic. If their neighbor is so nosy, surely she would have been curious when she heard the loud rumbling of Harry's clumsy remodeling? If we're being asked to imagine a 7-foot sasquatch literally crashing through the floor into the attic below, we also have to imagine that the amount of noise and tremor this would cause might possibly alert the person living next door.The real reason to recommend this film is Rick Baker's wonderfully realized Harry, who is easily the most realistically-molded sasquatch in film history (not much competition there, granted). Harry isn't supposed to menacing, he's supposed to be adorable, but we have to give Baker credit for rendering his creation with such detail that no matter how big he's smiling, we still sense that this big beast could easily tear someone to pieces if necessary. The late Kevin Peter Hall is the perfect actor to fill these immense shoes (feet?), and as in all his roles, he brings actual character to the role no matter how many layers of latex and hair they pile atop him. Hall's eyes are pretty much all we see of him here, but the range of emotions he conveys with simple expression brings forth the human qualities we're supposed to identify with in Harry.Watching the trailer and noting the deluge of scenes that didn't appear in the film, there is a sense that this was a troubled production. I'm not sure what William Dear was setting out to make, but he apparently did his best with what he had, and the result is a family film that has enough winning qualities to make the fantastical premise work. Harry doesn't quite tug at the heartstrings, it's far too sappy for that, but it is a film with the power to make you smile. Not a bad selling point, that.Though the ending sets things up for the inevitable Harrys And The Hendersons, it's probably a good thing this film wasn't successful enough to spawn a franchise. As it stands, it's just good enough to recommend, and it's hard to imagine a sequel doing anything but stripping the film's limited charms away.This is not an essential film by any means, but fans of the Spielberg school of fantasy family fare could certainly find a worse way to spend an afternoon.

He's an adopted member of Seattle's Henderson family, eating goldfish and plants, burying stuffed deer heads and mink coats, and relaxing in front of the TV while laughing at re-runs of The Addams Family. He wasn't always in the family. Mr. Henderson had almost run him (it?) over in the road, brought him home, and cared for the big guy.All good things must come to an end, and the Hendersons eventually must choose if Harry remains with their family or if he should be driven back to the wild.Watch the movie for mindless entertainment and you won't be disappointed!!

It's a fine vacation, it's even got agenerator so they can watch Masterpiece Theatre. Survival of the fittest! But when they were driving home in the family station wagon, they drive in the glaring sun. Then BAM! The car hits something!! It has a large hairy being.REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS, BUT READ ON BECAUSE IT'S A GOOD REVIEW      George suggests they take it home and sell it to a museum. So theystrap it to the roof and drive home. But it comes alive and flies off the car. It was alive!! Then appears dead when it hits the ground.Meanwhile, long after they'd gone, a hunter named Jacques LaFluer, who'sobsessed with hunting down large targets, noticed a bent license plate, the one that had fallen off the Henderson wagon.       Well having a Bigfoot in the house wasn't a pleasant experience at first. It knocked over the refrigerator and ate the plants, and crashed through the walls. The police didn't believe George so theywere now on their own. But not for long, their neighbor was bringing their dog back, so they hid Bigfoot in the basement with youngest son, Ernie, who grows quite attached to him. Bigfoot adapts nicely to the dog. He even learns how to enjoy quality television likeBedtime for Bonzo with Ronald Reagan. George names Bigfoot Harrybefore agreeing to take him home to the woods, so that night they throw a hamburger party, they then discover that Harry is a vegetarian when he throws the meat from his burger to the dogs. Ernie dislikes the idea of taking Harry back so while the family explains, Harry escapes from George's car, putting a dent in the roof and knocking off the back door. George goes searching for Harry who winds up all over the place.          George goes to visit an anthropologist, Dr. Wallace Wrightwood, who has written books on the Sasquatch. While wife Nancy is visited by Richard Smith, Jacques LaFluer incognito, then he goes to buy fourfifty-eight magnums.         George's father, who owns the gun shop George works in, to draw a big full-sized Bigfoot for his customers, but George doesn't want to, because it's like drawing a wanted poster of your bestfriend. So George draws a peaceful Bigfoot, but after he deals with customers who want Big Big Guns and Big Big Ammo, Dad changed the drawing into a fierce beast.         That night, the SWAT team is hunting for Harry. Good thing George found him in time, but the feds caught Jacques LeFleur whoattempted to assassinate Harry. And since Harry's rescue involved a romp in a garbage truck, the family gives him a bath while watching The Addams Family, so do them it was like bathing Cousin Itt.       Dr. Wallace Wrightwood comes over for dinner and agrees to help them get Harry to a save place where Jacques can't find him. So theyleft the next morning. They took Wrightwood's van, and Wrightwood slashed Jacques' tires, so Jacques steals George's station wagon. There's mayhem on the freeway and they arrive in the forest, outwit Jacques LeFleur, and get Harry back to his home in the wilderness.Harry even likes Jacques LeFleur as a friendand even the latter softens up, even though, There's always Lochness.       I love this film. I've been watching it since I was a very little kid. John Lithgow is good, and so is Don Ameche! So if you like films like this one, see this one!!

I first saw Harry and the Hendersons between kindergarten and first grade; I'm not sure that I would recommend it for children that young. I saw it again a few years later, and it seemed hokier each progressive time. Needless to say, a major surprise came when I read the cast. Aside from John Lithgow, Melinda Dillon and Don Ameche, there's also Lainie Kazan (the mother in My Big Fat Greek Wedding), and in a smaller role there's William Frankfather (the albino in Foul Play). Director William Dear also has a brief appearance.Anyway, not a bad movie, but nothing that I would recommend.And yes it's true, my dad knew co-writer Ezra Rappaport as a teenager. I don't know whether or not Rappaport was involved in the production of another movie after this.

Harry (Bigfoot) is one of the first believable and truly charming animatronic puppet to come along in a long long while. It is probably only rivaled by E.T. and Yoda in that aspect. The acting is not bad and the script is quite good, but gets mushy near the end. All in all a good family movie.

What Liberal bias? Well, how about anti-hunting, anti-guns, the normal cheap shot at (Republican President) Ronald Reagan, a plug for evolution, a ton of OMGs, a lot of profanity including kids swearing, etc, etc.) All of this Left Wing nonsense wasn't needed, either, as it could have been a solid family-oriented comedy and adventure. Take the cute and funny little kid (Joshua Rudoy?). He profanes three times. The first time, he apologizes and his father responds, It's okay; it's close to what you meant, anyway. In other words, profanity from your little son is okay, according to th script writers.Otherwise, it's a fun movie with a humorous gorilla Bigfoot, a fast-moving story and you even get some nice Oregon woods scenery. There is just no excuse for the language in here, and this should have been rated PG-13. I laugh at the people who call this good family fare. I haven't seen one movie yet with John Lithgow in it, that wasn't sleazy.

It's a textbook example of the idiot plot. You keep on saying to yourself, why would he/she do that?  I wouldn't do that. Would you do that?  That's really stupid.  I didn't believe in the motivations for anything any character did, at any point.  And after 30 minutes, I changed the channel. "}]
