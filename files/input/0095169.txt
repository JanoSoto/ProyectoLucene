Boy was I wrong. This is some serious stuff, like what happens after you get married to someone you think you're in love with. You don't really know what love is if you haven't known pain.Ringwald gives a great performance, especially as she's going through post-partum depression. I didn't particularly like the camera work or the laconic script, but I did appreciate the work that went into the direction and the production. I thought the pacing was fantastic - it's not what you would expect and I was pleasantly surprised.

I'd have to say that I have two all time favorite movies, and this is a tie with The Year My Voice Broke.  This movie, is set in (present day -which at the time was 1988)in a small town of the U.S.  These two high school sweethearts get pregnant, and decide that although both sets of parents are against it, they are going to get married.  It's the story of their successes and trials that they face throughout their pregnancy and once the baby is born while they are married.  Molly Ringwald is wonderful in the movie, but then, I think she's one of the most talented actresses, who unfortunately was type-casted so much, really wasn't able to overcome it after the '80s.  Her leading man is also very good.  I found him to be a great pick for that role, and he made you believe he really was his character. This movie is sweet, sincere, and really true to what the message is trying to say. I love this movie, and hope that all of you will take the time to watch it.  It's not only educational but romantic, and heartwarming. I give it a 10 out of 10.That's my review.

I was also surprised at the realism of how they all came around, both of the couples parents realizing that they wanted to be involved in the child's life, and the couple coming around realizing they were fighting for the wrong reasons. This movie took a page right out of my life. To all the teens who read this review, this is what having a baby is really like. Remember life isn't always as easy as it looks in the movies.

During the first half of the movie, it's quite sweet and more than a little humorous, but then, about the time of the baby's birth, the tone takes a drastic and sudden downturn. It seemed to me that someone from some parents league had cornered the director and said something like, If you make a light-hearted comedy about pregnant teens, then teens all over America are going to think it's fun to have a baby... Why not show some of the problems young couples with children have to face? The second part of the movie piles on so much trouble, misfortune and drama that it seems like some kind of Lifetime docudrama. So much in their young lives goes wrong that in order to have an acceptable ending, too much has to go right all at once. The ending just doesn't seem believable because it is such a sudden jump from the end of the second act.I liked the characters, who remained believable throughout the various situations. The plot and direction could have been worked out a bit more carefully. "},{"Title":"I loved this movie!

The story might be a little too familiar to some these days but I have always found stories about a young, relatively inexperienced, couple trying to make it in the real world amusing and interesting (provided that it's well told). 'For Keeps¿' is quite a decent and likable film and it brings that nostalgic 80's feel. I found the ending to be a little rushed but otherwise its exploration of a teenage couple trying to make it on their own was interestingly executed. Randall Batinkoff and Molly Ringwald are superb and a fit cast. Both actors have great chemistry. Their expression of Stan and Darcy's naivety, devotion towards and love for one another and struggle to make it, is well depicted on screen. The supporting cast is good too. Director Avildsen adds humour in the most unexpected scenes, preventing the film from going over the top with melodrama and instead bringing a smile to the viewer. The movie has received a lot of undue criticism but I believe 'For Keeps¿' is among the underrated films of the 80s.

They portray the angst of having a baby when you are very young with such intensity that one would think the story to be a true story. I have no idea why the IMDb score for this movie is as low as it is. The plot is sound, the characters are logical, there is plenty of romance, humor and drama. The story might not be set into the breathtaking New Zealand landscapes but instead to a place we all might relate to. Same goes with the situation the two youngsters end up in. They are intelligent and ambitious and they have a solid plan how they intend to waltz through life. However, plans are just plans when life takes an interesting turn for you and this movie portrays such a situation with skill. Yes, it's a bit predictable but romantic movies tend to be so, eh? The plot moves at a brisk pace and I felt there were no unnecessary scenes or characters. Even the minor characters (there's a comedic relief guy too) stayed very minor as the story concentrated on the two youngsters.The most interesting thing in this movie for me was how the two youngsters try to cope with their new situation, responsibilities and emotions. They love each other, but it is not easy all the time. Are there any couples who could say that statement is untrue? Their responsible families are not perfect (as it is in real life) and cause problems by loving too much. It's both sweet and annoying, maybe partly because that's just how it goes in real life too.If you are looking for a good and entertaining chick flick to watch, this one won't fail you.

I have watched it at least 100 times and it never gets old for me! I will say that it is not 100% realistic, but what movie is? It's Hollywood's way of spicing things up. It still has a lot of real situations and scenarios. The one side opposing adoption, the other apposing abortion - all over one baby! Then both sets of grandparents (save from Stan's mother) are against them keeping the baby. One real scenario being that MOST parents always try to control their child's future... in this case the kids made their own decisions and showed maturity in taking full responsibility for their actions. Yes they need a little help along the way, but so do a lot of older parents.From a teen mom's perspective it's all in all a wonderful movie with a lot of emotion and comedy in there as well.

Some may find it a little cheesy, but if you love chick flicks, you'll probably like this.As the user before me explained, it's about what happens to a young teenage couple, Stan and Darcy, after Darcy gets pregnant. Despite their parent's wishes, the two marry and decide to keep the baby; the movie is very realistic, and follows the ups-and-downs of being a young married couple with a baby. It's very romantic and heart-warming to see how the young couple weathers the storms of parenthood together and try to make things work, from family issues, taking care of a baby, and making a living. They have to work together for their dreams to be achieved.Personally, it's one of my favorites, and I had to buy it online because I couldn't find it anywhere! Not surprising, since I know it wasn't a very popular movie. But if you're a hopeless romantic/chick-flick fan, you'll very much enjoy it. Basically, you either love it or hate it.

But then realizes how much she loves her daughter Theadosea Bobrucze.Then Stan and Darcy have some trouble!! OF course all newlywed marriges are a little scary at the begging Darcy wants devoce but he doesn't want it so she'll have it anuled. But in the end the parents of Darcy and Stan forgive them for all the trouble they put themselves and future in and STAN AND DARCY live Happily ever after.I THINK THEY SHOULD MAKE A SECOND FOR KEEPS!!

Trouble is, none of them are very funny. The film is a misguided vehicle for Molly Ringwald whose career plummeted afterwords. Ringwald plays a high school senior named Darcy who is impregnated by her high school boyfriend Stan. Both kids seemed to have bright futures ahead of them until they decide to keep their baby, and end up having to abandon their respective dreams. The film was marketed as a comedy, and that is just irresponsible. The only laughs in the film come from Stan's father and his incredibly chauvinistic comments he makes about things like stretch marks and the need for handles on mattresses. Honestly, this guy could make a caveman seem civilized.Credit must be given to the writers and director John G. Avildsen, however. They don't really pull any punches when they detail just how difficult it can be for two teenagers to get married and try to raise a child. Many issues are discussed thoughtfully, including abortion, lack of money, lack of facilities at colleges for student-parents, and the loss of innocence. Darcy originally plans to abort the child, but cannot go through with it. The film wisely avoids dumping on the practice of abortion, and just simply makes it Darcy's choice. She does not want to get one. Simple as that. The two try to rent a filthy apartment but end up having to move back in with Darcy's mother. Stan does not adjust well to the thought of staying home with his wife and new daughter, and he begins to go out and drink quite often. Darcy's mother is portrayed as a jaded single mom who wants Stan out of her daughter's life. As you can see, the film chronicles one hardship after another for these two from the minute Darcy decides to have the baby. Much of it is very poignant. Just not very funny.You get the sense that Advildsen just gives up trying to make the audience laugh after about the first half hour. He could obviously sense that there just weren't many laughs to be had in this script. Still, he tries to go for the picture perfect type of ending his more successful films (Rocky, The Karate Kid) were known for. Writer Tim Kazurinsky, who is at times brilliant, cannot come up with any true comedic wisdom here. Contrast this film with the wonderful ...About Last Night and you can clearly see the difference. That film was a terrific blend of comedy and drama. For Keeps is pretty much all drama with a few chuckles. It must be said that Ringwald is exceptional as Darcy. Too bad this film kind of killed things for her. Randall Batinkoff has been solid in other films, but not here. Once the baby is born, he becomes a crying, whining, jerk who is impossible to sympathize with. Overall, the film is a misfire. It never should have been marketed as a comedy. 5 of 10 stars.The Hound.
