This was definitely such a movie.The story centers on April(Sherilyn Fenn) a rich southern belle engaged to a preppy southern boy who then meets Perry a drifter/carnival worker(played to perfection by Richard Tyson) and falls head over heels for him. There are thousands of movies made every year with a familiar theme like this. But there is something special and really unique about 2 moon junction that makes it a cut above the rest.Besides having two absolutely magnificent looking stars two moon junctionalso has atmosphere, sensuality and a great supporting cast including an appearance by Kristy Mc.Nicol. Never boring, the movie is set in a small southern town and manages to capture to a tee, the luminous beauty of the south. Besides it's lovely southern feel, the film has an electric sensuality about it, that coupled with a certain dreaminess, a mystery in most every scene makes the picture irresistible. I'm not a major fan of movies like this but two moon junction was an amazing pic that never received much recognition beyond the it's hot type.I don't know why Fenn and Tyson never became big stars. Both were made for these roles and have an on screen chemistry that contributes a lot to making this movie unforgettable. In fact they are so believable and the chemistry so apparent early on, that the audience is rooting for them from their first meeting. The rest of the cast,particularly an amazing, sassy, Christy Mc.Nicol, and a scheming Louise Fletcher were great too. There is a type of dream like, quiet to this movie, every scene is pivotal to the ultimate ending, the only gripe I have is the ending which while alright was to quick and could have been expanded on a little. Still, this movie(easily) gets a 10 of 10. Through the years, whenever myself and my fellow movie goers turn somebody on to this film inevitably the same thing happens. They, at first don't want to watch it, then after viewing it, like it so much that they want to see it again. Says a lot about the picture....Anyone who has ever loved with a kind of mindless passion will be able to relate to this. The magic of the film is also in turning everyday things into objects of mystery. (Look at what they do with a simple carnival!)Many may not agree with me, but I give it 10 of 10-easily. They took a subject matter that has been done over and over again and turned it into something with mystery and intrigue.

It's hardly anything more than that, but does it have to be?  The film is set in the deep south, but the faulty accents and in-and-around LA locations sometimes give it away.  It's a highly stylized exercise in melodramatic erotica.  There's no mystery here -- even the ending can be seen coming a mile away!  Basically the plot is a Southern Belle sows her wild oats before her wedding, and finds herself torn between sensuality and stability.  She meets a carny who offers her one last hot fling before she marries her boring college sweetheart.  Which one will she chose?What's to like?  Sherilyn Fenn is radiant as April, and overcomes most all of the bad dialogue. She's a great actress! Kristy McNichol steals the few scenes she is in with a flair for comedy and easy earthy sensuality!  Why is she not doing more?  Richard Tyson plays a rough and tumble drifter carny who gets to pout and preen as a male himbo who is justly portrayed as good at one thing.  The plot is silly, and you even get an over-the-top Louise Fletcher appearing as the matriarch who knows all too well that lust fades, but financial security is worth everything!  I love this movie though.  It is charming in its own way, and sensual without being too graphic.  Nothing is subtle, but it pays off as one of the most enjoyable Zalman King outings ever!  Notice the almost ALL WHITE costumes!  These people spend a fortune on bleach.  Notice the hottest scene seems to be when Sherilyn Fenn and Kristy McNichol dance together on a deserted jukejoint floor.  Notice the great soundtrack!  Let yourself go, and enjoy an old-fashioned pot boiler romance filmed and acted better than it ever had a right to be.

I hated the film but I actually thought this was going to be serious. Obviously it's not. While the sex scenes are pretty hot and Fenn and Tyson have great bodies, the dialogue is pretty lame and the story has been done many times before. The acting is OK and Kristy McNichol throws in an amusing little performance (and goes topless too).So as a silly little sex film for guys it works. It's gets a 6 for the attractive leads, some nice cinematography and the sex. Just don't take it seriously.

Having said this I let the film be what it wants to be; erotic. Nothing more, nothing less. If you watch <Two Moon Junction> having preconceptions about how erotica HAS to involve bad acting, or a lame script, you won't let its passion take over your film experience. I have to admit I wasn't particularly interested in the acting as much as the chemistry between the characters. I felt the acting fine, and chemistry top-notch=)   Not many people have seen <In God's Hands>, a film about three nomadic surfers, but just in case you either have or are planning to see this other Zalman King great After seeing it, you will appreciate what King was trying to put forth in <Two Moon Junction> after seeing <In God's Hands>. Passion. Sensuality. The difference is TMJ is erotic wheras IGH was about the surfer mentality and spirituality. In both films however, what you see and think are not as important as how you feel while you're watching them. The whole is greater than the sum of their parts.   Richard Tyson as the lead may or may not be adequate for guys, although attractive to most of us women. But whether you're a chick or not, you will find Sherilynn Fenn outright gorgeous, point blank. She's beautiful, sexy, sultry, seductive, mischievous, etc...not to mention a platinum blonde with a charming Southern accent. (Watch for a few tiny but oh-so-precious Milla Jovovich scenes=)    Overall this film obviously isn't an Oscar contender, because there is no category for most sensual film. But the fact that this is a little-known gem with a LOT of sex appeal,- no taboos, no manipulations or even morals to shove down your throat- is what gives this film its unique appeal, and the sky is the limit sexual power; the less preconceptions you have, the more you will enjoy the film =)        Did I mention the soundtrack perfectly complements the eye candy and captures the mood of the film? Another Zalman King strength.

In fact I enjoyed it so much that I didn't want it to end. Richard Tyson was beyond hot and Sherilyn Fenn was beautiful. Both were sexy, sensual and desirable and played their part perfectly. I loved the chemistry between these two characters and I thoroughly enjoyed the storyline so much so I wished it was longer. I found each character brought a little something to the story, but not enough to detract from the central focus of the plot. The soundtrack I found to be very haunting and although I knew it was pure instrumental when I bought it, I still wish there were the other few songs that weren't included from the movie. I would love for there to be a special edition DVD of the movie, perhaps with extra footage of deleted scenes and other bonus features. The ending was great, but what would have really made it better was if April didn't marry Chad, (which I assume is what she did due to the wedding ring that we saw on her finger at the end of the movie in the shower scene) and instead ran of to be with Perry. At least that's what I would have done!

I can pretty much guarantee that seeing Burl Ives in this piece of crap softcore erotica will be unlike anything you've seen pop up in a film before. Unfortunately, Ives neither gets naked nor sings Have a Holly Jolly Christmas in this movie, which would have made it a must see for bizarre cinema. Instead you have to settle for seeing Sherilyn Fenn naked, a guy who could be Fabio Jr. suffering from what has to be premature ejaculation and a topless Kristy McNichol giving the best performance in the whole thing.April (Sherilyn Fenn) is an Alabama rich girl fresh out of college and soon to marry her rich, preppy fiancée Chad (Martin Hewitt). After masturbating in the shower while seemingly re-enacting a scene out of Porky's, April takes her sisters to a nearby traveling carnival. There, April comes to the sexual attention of shirtless carny Perry (Richard Tyson), who spends most of the movie alternating between jerk and a slab of beef. They have sex, which Perry videotapes with the camera that belongs to April's family. When Perry gets himself thrown out of the carnival after a scene that could have been lifted out of an old episode of The A Team or Matt Houston, April, Perry and a hyper cowgirl named Patty Jean (Kristy McNichol) hang out for a while.After some Sapphic undertones between the two women, Patty Jean just leaves for no particular reason and we get another sex scene with April and Perry. Then April's grandmother Belle (Louise Fletcher) has the sheriff (Burl Ives) run Perry out of town. Perry comes back, however, and even though he's a penniless drifter who lives in a semi and is a foul-tempered drunk, asks April to run away with him. Well, he doesn't really ask her, but I think we're supposed to assume that's what he wants.Does April run away with Perry? Does she marry her completely inoffensive fiancée? Why does Perry's dead dog get a viking funeral pyre? How could any woman go through as many different hairstyles as April in just two weeks? If you're anxious to find out the answer to these or any other possible questions about Two Moon Junction, you really need to get a hobby or a prescription for muscle relaxants.This movie has a lot of Sherilyn Fenn in the buff along with the aforementioned topless Kristy McNichol and the oddity of seeing Burl Ives in a softcore erotica flick. If any of that intrigues you, and you can get it at a discount price, go ahead a rent Two Moon Junction. If you want anything at all more than that, forget about it.The sex scenes in this movie are short, unmemorable and finally conclude with the camera spending an uncomfortably long time fixated on a nude and crying Fenn. McNichol's Patty Jean is the only interesting character in the entire story and none of them behave in a remotely believable or human way. The film doesn't even try and come up with a reason why April would screw around with this Fabio-like carny and it ends with a hilariously melodramatic action scene and a romp in a shower that makes you question if even these filmmakers thought there was a point to this story.Two Moon Junction was largely writer/director Zalman King's big break. He went on from this to become the king of late night cable erotica with Red Shoes Diaries. I think his time and talent would have been better spent sacking groceries at Hy-Vee.

Fenn was only 22 here and about as beautiful as an actress gets. That her acting is only passable explains why she never has received better roles. Surprising is Christy McNicol who does her usual good acting job, but here wearing the shortest mini-skirt you've even seen, and even doing a topless scene where she and Fenn trade tops in a liquor store bathroom. In spite of the obvious B-grade sexy lure of this movie, it actually has a moderately interesting, though implausible, story of a rich, high society college graduate about to marry in kind, falling for a carnival worker with long hair and who rarely wears a shirt. It is the old story of a woman who isn't quite what she seems to be, and gives in to the temptation of the gritty and dangerous.SPOILERS follow, in case anyone cares.  There is a scene where great editing switches between the two illicit lovers entangled at Two Moon Junction as her fiancee is watching a stripper during his bachelor party. The next day the wedding goes on as scheduled, a deputy botches his assignment to kill the carny worker, and a day or two later 'carny' goes back to his motel room, the shower is running, playing off an earlier scene where Fenn comes in her home to find him in her shower. As they embrace, we see a closeup of her hand, with wedding ring. Will she try to have it both ways??

Although she doesn't quite love her fiancé, Chad Fairchild (Martin Hewitt) he is certainly nice enough to her and for that reason she doesn't actively resist her upcoming marriage to him. Then one day she just happens to meet a poor and wild young man named Perry (Richard Tyson) and suddenly her passions get the best of her in the worst possible way. Now, while any film featuring Sherilyn Fenn in a soft-core sex role would normally get my attention, this particular film turned out to be somewhat disappointing due in large part to the slow pace of the movie from start to finish. Likewise, although her performance was quite good, I would have preferred the vivacious, brunette version of Sherliyn Fenn found in Boxing Helena over the blonde, demure type presented here. Of course, the role called for a more classy personality but for some reason it didn't quite resonate as well in the overall context of the story. Something just wasn't right. Again, the slow pace didn't help in that regard either. In any case, from what I understand Sherilynn Fenn did not enjoy making this movie but even so she was the only reason this film wasn't a complete disaster as she was absolutely stunning. Be that as it may, I have rated the movie accordingly. Average.

She's literally the Queen of the ball. They seem happy together and her father likes him. Then the carnival comes to town. While everybody is away, carnie Perry (Richard Tyson) breaks in and takes a shower. April gets intrigued by the danger and has an affair with the hunky carnie. Her grandmother Belle Delongpre (Louise Fletcher) suspects her of straying and assigns local sheriff Earl Hawkins (Burl Ives) on the case. While she's riding with Patti Jean (Kristy McNichol), the carnival has a breakdown and a brawl ensues. She falls deeper into that world. Belle and Earl try to get rid of Perry.This is a cheesy sexploitation B-movie. It is definitely one of the better made of its genre. The dialog is cheesy. The plot is ripped from a romance novel. Richard Tyson looks like he's from the cover of a romance novel. Sherilyn Fenn is probably above the material. One can't really complain about the script or the style. The movie knows it's cheesy and fully embraces it. It's sort of like 50 Shades or Nine 1/2 Weeks. It even has Hervé Villechaize in it.

This movie fails to deliver a believable story, interesting characters and good juicy sexy scenes. The only reason to rent this movie would be to watch an easy drama, that with the help of a reasonable plot will deliver some exciting and intriguing sexual encounters. Unfortunately that's not what happens.The story is silly and full of cliche'. The director's opinion of sexiness and sensuality seemed to limit on showing Richard Tyson's character too many times bare-chested. The actual sex scenes were obvious, boring and overplayed by the soundtrack. Just for fun, it was interesting to see a young Milla Jovovich, and a cameo of Kristy McNichol, plus the guy from Fantasy Island Herve' Villechaize.Some of the comments here have described this movie among the most exciting ever seen.... Well, if you are 12, or you work for the movie producers, maybe. Our suggestions, if you want to see a good movie that fulfill the promises of passion, great chemistry among the 2 lead actors and wonderful love scenes, are The end of an affair, or The last tango in Paris.

Terrible writing, terrible acting, terrible directing...what we have here is an unmitigated disaster. There isn't much of a story at all and what little story we have is basically just one ridiculous cliché after another. Sherilyn Fenn plays April, the young, beautiful Southern belle from a wealthy family who is about to marry some successful but boring guy. Inevitably she falls for the big, dumb hunk who shows up completely out of the blue. And there's your whole movie. That's it. Most of the dialogue is laughably bad but the filmmakers hope to distract you from this by having Fenn take off her clothes at regular intervals. Well, I guess we should be thankful for anything that distracts from the unintentional comedy which ensues anytime anyone speaks in this movie. Someone actually read this script and decided it was a good idea to make this movie? Fenn and Richard Tyson, who plays the object of her desires, are quite bad here but you almost can't blame them as the script gives them absolutely nothing to work with. This movie just miserably slogs along until just when you think things can't get any worse Louise Fletcher, playing April's grandmother, gives a quite serious speech about just how important her family's silverware is. Yes, they've been handing down these spoons for generations! Do you know who ate with these spoons? Oh boy, is this bad. It's the most laughable moment in a movie which is basically nothing but a series of laughable moments. An awful script, amateurish directing and some really lousy performances. That about sums it up. Terrible, just terrible. Stay far, far away from this one.

Lousy attempt to mine the same erotic territory as Nine 1/2 Weeks, but at least that film had a competent director...this thing's got Zalman King (you know right away where he's coming from he keeps the girl naked and begging). Kristy McNichol shows up in a cameo played for high camp value (she gets naked too!). A couple of lines made me laugh, but film is embarrassing when it tries to get serious. The crux of this garbage is that Fenn's character can't make a decision without stripping and crying, stripping and crying.

The script is embarrassingly risible, the direction is pedestrian but the acting is dire, dire, dire..... how come these people get paid?. The two lead characters look, for most of the film, like the cardboard on the back of a cereal packet. I have never rated Sherilyn Fenn very highly... her performances in both Boxing Helena and Twin Peaks were, to put it mildly, amateurish but in this film she makes even a piece of dead wood look like an Oscar winner.I managed to sit through only 20 minutes of this rubbish before switching off the DVD and throwing it away! Erotic???? There's more eroticism in a wet paper bag floating down a drain in a rainstorm! Zalman King should take up dominoes instead.... he certainly can't direct a film and, as for his script..... my 5 year old grand daughter can string words together to create better, more interesting and cohesive sentences than his.This is an insult to the film industry.Even if someone offers you money to watch it... don't.... avoid it like the plague!

I'd give it one star, but its very badness makes it entertaining! Bad script, bad acting, bad music, bad hair hysterical from beginning to end. I'm serious, by the end I was exhausted from laughing so hard! Even the scene where the dog dies is funny, and I'm the type who cries buckets over Old Yeller.I'm not even going to bother discussing the so-called plot, except to say rich gal, engaged to successful guy, meets buff carnie worker and falls in love with him. Many shirt removals ensue.As for the soft porn some critics have touted, it's disappointing. I keep hearing that women like this movie. All that tells me is how pathetically under-served women are by the film industry, that they would be grateful for such paltry crumbs as these. Yes, Richard Tyson is attractive (except for the hair) but you hardly get to see any of him. He occasionally takes his shirt off, whoop de doo. Is his lower body covered with horrible burns, or something? It must be, because nudity in this movie is confined to the female characters. Time and again the camera focuses lovingly on Sherrilyn Fenn, who, by the way, makes having an orgasm seem like an unpleasant chore. One wonders if she's ever actually had one.Even the makeup is incompetent. There's this one scene, after Tyson's character gets beaten up, where he has what looks like a perfectly round hole in his forehead, and he and Fenn are having sex, and it's supposed to be hot, but you keep seeing this weird hole in his head and laughing...OMG, it's sooooooooooo bad. I'm shocked to see so many positive reviews of this ridiculous clunker. 2 out of 10 stars.

For the person who said when he/she gets someone to watch it, they want to watch it again - I find it hard to believe. I only watched it because I was at a friend's house one night with a bunch of other women and this one girl had brought it along to watch. It had been her mother's favorite movie (before she committed suicide) so no one wanted to tell this girl we didn't want to watch it. When I saw Sherilyn Fenn was in it, I thought I might like it after all (since I was a Twin Peaks fan). Well - it was terrible from the get go. The plot - if you can call it that - was so stupid and contrived. I couldn't believe it would hold anyone's interest. Then - personally - I found the lead man, Perry, repulsive. Yeah - great body - but did anyone bother looking from the neck UP? It was all just an excuse for soft core porn. A bunch of poorly scripted scenes thrown together to try and make an excuse for soft core porn. That's all this is. ** SPOILER ** A guy breaks into your home and you find him in your shower and start a hot and heavy affair with him? PLEASE! Flag on the play! No - you don't - you call 911. And no matter how horrible he was - she kept going back for the sex?? Yeah right! She was so pretty she could have had her pick of men. She could have found another hunk who wouldn't treat her like dirt if she wanted to step out on the boring fiancé. I had trouble holding my tongue throughout. Give me break! was heard frequently throughout, and not just by me. No one wanted to tell this girl after that not one of us liked that movie even one little bit and could not understand why it would have been her mother's (or anyone's) favorite. That's me and 4 other women - all thinking it was absolute trash. Now - if you get off on soft core porn - go ahead and get a thrill. Otherwise - PASS!  "}]
