This film is about the acting. It does what most other thrillers and films stay away from, the performances. A cop (Maura Tierney) with some very dark secrets is on the trail of a kidnapper (Adrien Brody) who buried a rich woman (Laila Robins) alive in the New York woods. This is a cat and mouse thriller from beginning to end. Adrien Brody is fantastic as a the sick, obsessed with Harry Houdini kidnapper. His acting is so real it's like he's not even trying. He's cunning, cleaver, smart and sick all at the same time. It's drama to the end. He really needs to be cast as the villain in more films. Put him in an action film and bring a whole new level to the word terrorist. Maura Tierney best know for her stint on Newsradio and Jim Carrey's ex-wife in Liar, Liar is just spectacular. She pulls off the cop with more than just problems. She beautiful, tough and confused. Throughout a lot of the film she's in tears. She can act and be tough. Get her some scripts, I wanna see this girl more often. The supporting cast is also great and each brings realism to their performances. Even though this film has dark characters and a dark subject matter, the film is very light looking. The brightness of the film will grab from the start. The colors stand out and are hardly missed. The film has a action flick look but it's a thriller. It's a different mix that works extremely well. Oxygen is an well acted thriller that will drain you. I highly recommend that all should run and check this one out. It's very high on the must see meter.

The story is good, but would have suffered in the hands of a less competent director and cast.  This is a movie that depends a lot on performance to deliver, and it does.  Some of the supporting cast could have been played by better actors, but they are serviceable and are mostly meant to occasionally prod the story along another notch.  On the whole, the cast stays out of the way of Brody and Tierney, who are the whole show.  It's definitely worth seeing, and another one of those films that seemingly came out of nowhere, as I never heard of it before.  I like solid B movies, and this stands out as one of the best.  Its obscurity helps to conceal its surprises, and it helps to be surprised with this movie.  I gave it an 8 out of 10.

Armed with experience and a bigger budget, Shepard has wrested outstanding performances from Maura Tierney and Adrien Brody, in their best work to date. Both characters are quite believable, and their defects are gently extracted and displayed by the subtle script. There are no stereotypes or one-dimensional characters in the whole film.This is not to say that this is some esoteric, art-house movie, suitable only for clove-smoking turtleneck-wearers. The action scenes are well-executed and edited. Camera work is very nice; the long Steadicam shot in the train is especially memorable. Tension holds on throughout, and even the asides (such as an FBI agent's humorous soliloquy about the death penalty) integrate well and don't distract.I sure would like to see what Richard Shepard could do if given some Really Big Bucks. "},{"Title":"Taut Crime Thriller","Date":"5 February 2000","Score":"13 out of 16 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  This made for TV psychological crime thriller exceeded my expectations.  The story begins with the abduction of a rich wife for ransom.  She is buried alive and her abductor sets about collecting the ransom for the location of her grave.  However, this is really not the story but only the set up.  The real story is about what happens after he is caught as the police and the FBI race against time to get him to reveal where she's buried.Our sociopathic villain, known to us only as Harry (after his idol Harry Houdini) is well prepared for the psychological cat and mouse game that follows as he had planned what he would do if he were caught.  The result is an effective (though often superficial) contest of psychological one upsmanship between Harry (Adrien Brody) and our heroine police detective, Madeline (Maura Tierney).The story has some noticeable plot flaws for a film that is attempting to be a serious crime drama.  Certain elements of Harry's escape attempts are implausible.  Much of the dialogue between the police officers and FBI agents was inane drivel that made them look like idiots.  There are other problems later in the story involving the buried wife that are also troubling.  These are not enough, however, to mar an otherwise well crafted plot.I was most impressed by the photography, not just the look of the film, but the way the images presented themselves.  Director Richard Shepard used the camera very creatively, using objects in foreground and background to dramatize certain images.  There was an excellent shot of Madeline's reflection seen in extreme close-up in Harry's eye.  The handheld chase scenes made you feel like you were running behind the action.  This is a level of directing that is not normally seen on TV.  The whole film had a very raw, real look.  Things were dirty and disorganized, just like in real life rather than being carefully and symmetrically placed.The acting ranged from fair to excellent.  The cops and the husband were generally pretty mediocre with moments of nausea.  Maura Tierney was good but didn't have the range to play Madeline effectively.  Madeline's character required a combination of tormented, pathetic self abuser and case hardened cop.  Tierney was outstanding at the tormented side, but came across as tentative and flaccid as the cop (which was the greater part of the role).The best performance comes from Adrian Brody as Harry.  He was wry and unsophisticated while being just close enough to the edge to keep you guessing if he was cunning or just a psychopath.  He played the part with sarcastic disdain, as if the character thought he was smarter than he really was, which indeed was the case.Terry Kinney's character, Madeline's cop husband Tim, didn't give him much to work with.  He was a wimpy whining loser.  Kinney did an adequate job at this portrayal.I rated this movie 7/10.  For those who enjoy a psychological crime thriller, it won't disappoint.

The story seemed like a good one, and I was in a hurry for something, so I decided to give it a whirl.The story is interesting. A middle-aged woman, Frances, is walking her dog when she is approached by what seems like a mild-mannered man. Before she knows it, he flashes a gun, dazes her by hitting her on the temple with it, and smuggles her into a car with a friend. They drive out to the woods somewhere, where she is terrified at the realization that they plan to bury her alive, holding her hostage for her rich husband's money. They put her in the box, the man's accomplice mercifully slipping her the flashlight, and bury her, leaving her to scream in terror.Move to New York City, where a cop, Madeline, is made aware of the predicament. After witnessing a horrifying tape of Frances begging for help in the woods, the police must plot to catch the kidnappers and find the woman, all in twenty-four hours, or Frances will run out of oxygen and die.I won't elaborate any more on the plot, only that this movie was surprisingly good. When I noticed it was from A-Pix, I groaned and figured I was in for an hour and a half of trash. But then I saw the breathtaking first few minutes, and I was shocked. If anything, those first three to five minutes are terrifying. As Frances is being buried, she is screaming and begging, struggling to survive, lying in that wooden box as the cover is being slipped on, with only a flashlight to depend upon. And even though the cops-pursuing-the-antagonist plotline is overused, it was quite tense, especially when you realize that there are only twenty-four hours to solve the mystery of where Frances is, and the kidnapper is not interested in talking, while his accomplice is nowhere to be found. Yes, there are flaws. The script is quite bad, with some lines that I can't believe they wrote in. For some reason, I liked the FBI agent's monologue on the death penalty a la lethal injection, but a lot was pretty bad. Maura Tierney was somewhat convincing as the main cop, playing a B-movie's Clarice Starling. The actor who played Francis's husband was a bit campy. Adrian Brody, the kidnapper, was pretty good, if not a little tough to believe. The one who out-acted them all was Laila Robins, who played Francis. Her role is quite small, only because there's a lot of restrictions with laying in a box underground for the most of the movie. But she was so convincing. My favorite scene is when the flashlight is dying, and she is screaming and begging for it to live a little longer, because, as we learn early on, she is afraid of the dark. I swear, I felt like I was her, and I couldn't believe how empathetic I was of her. Her acting reminded me of Marylin Burn's stellar performance as Sally in Texas Chainsaw Massacre. She conveyed the emotions of the situation very well. I think that's why I felt so bad for her.Overall, I recommend finding this. No, it's not the best thing ever made, but it is very good, and quite intense. Check it out!

A thriller that offers great performances from a lesser known cast, chases, twists and turns, and an overall satisfying story.Director Richard Shepard had offers of a larger budget but it would have meant having it done the way the higher-ups in suits would have wanted it done.  By managing to get several producers on the project, he was allowed to do the film the way he wanted and actually pulled off a fun thriller on a little over a million dollars for the budget.   A wealthy sociallite is kidnapped, buried alive, and a ransom is demanded to reveal her location--but she has less than 24 hours, that is, if the air in her makeshift coffin lasts that long.  There's a lot of talking going on in the process of saving her, but hey, figure how it would happen in real life, and for those looking for some thinking material as well as thrills, this plot works just fine.  Besides, to me the most terrifying thing I can imagine is suffocating or drowning, and the idea of being buried alive like in this film is genuinely creepy.Maura Tierney plays the cop role with much seriousness, Adrien Brody is so off kilter you forget he's actually a decent guy in real life (as revealed on the DVD's audio commentary), but big points go to Laila Robins as the woman buried alive--her character is so convincing she makes you feel uneasy to the point of squirming in your seat.  There's a stunning car chase as well to satisfy action enthusiasts, but it's within context and not just another cheap thrill to fill up time.  And just when you think things are about to finish, a really big wrench is thrown in to twist the story even more and have you thinking, Wait just a darn minute....I found viewing the DVD a much more satisfying experience, as you get the widescreen version and better quality picture.  The audio commentary is quite informative and even informal, as the director points out a tiny judgment mishap in which a scene was shot early with the actors wearing jackets, but the rest of the film surrounding that scene everyone is made to look like they're sweating from the hot weather.  Considering I was originally enthralled with the story, I really didn't notice that until listening to the commentary.  The DVD also has an interesting storyboard sequence for the car chase scene, with commentary.  For a lesser known film with a small budget, there was quite a bit of care put in this release.Give yourself a treat and check this film out.  Consider this  Sometimes it's more fun to try a film that's not a big market blockbuster instead of having to only go with a top 10 title.  Just because a film has big stars and is pushed as a hot new release in a video store doesn't mean anything (goodness, haven't you learned that by now, folks?).  Oxygen is one of those great little surprises that will have you saying, Gee, why didn't I give this one a try earlier?

Held for one million dollars in ransom money Harry demands from Frances' millionaire art collector husband Clark, James Naughton, that if he doesn't get the cash by 600 Am the next morning she'll be dead; Dying from suffocation by being buried alive in some unknown location outside the city limits.The movie starts to get really strange when NYPD lady Det. Madeline Maddy Foster, Maura Tierney, is put on the case. With the police and Det. Foster casing out the money drop at the Queens Cemetery, where Harry Houdini just happens to be buried, Harry-the Psycho-leaves himself wide open to be captured by walking right into the trap that the police set for him. After a French Connection style car case thorough the city Harry is finally captured and put into police custody. It's then when we finally realize what exactly Harry's motives in kidnapping Frances, and her pet pooch, really were! They turned out to be just as crazy and unpredictable as he is!We also get to see Det. Foster's dark and secret life as a S&M freak that she's been keeping from her boss in the NYPD as well as husband Capt. Tim Foster, Terry Kinney. This strange and destructive lifestyle is quickly picked up by, who's very obviously into S&M himself, Det. Foster's captive Harry! With that knowledge in mind Harry does everything he can to get under Det.

Like being locked up in a jail cell in a New York City police station! Harry also uses his knowledge of Let. Foster's hang ups, as being into S&M, to cause her to lose her cool by hinting to her hubby Capt. Tim what a crazy freak he's married too. In the end Harry like most nut-cases like himself overplayed his hand in thinking that he's, not the NYPD, in control of what's going on in the movie. That leads to Harry ending up just where he put Frances, in a pine box, with him not worried about suffocating to death because of lack of oxygen because by then he wouldn't really need it anyway!P.S Earlier in the film there's a big chase scenes under the Brooklyn West-End elevated subway line that starts at the 62nd Steet station. It's that very same subway station where the exciting car chase in the film The French Connection ended with NYPD Det. Popeye Doyle gunning down his attempted assassin Frog #2 after chasing him down, after he derailed the hijacked subway train that he commandeered, and trapping him there!

He, & his accomplice (Michael Henderson), drive off to a wood where they bury Frances alive in a wooden coffin, she has about 24 hours worth of air left & the clock is ticking... Detective Madeline Foster (Maura Tierney) & her partner Jesse (Paul Calderon) are called onto the task force to find Frances & apprehend her kidnappers. They are both briefed, Frances rich husband Clarke (James Naughton) has received a videotape that demands he pay a $1,000,000 ransom or Frances will be left to suffocate & die an agonising & terrifying death. The money drop off goes OK until the kidnapper figures out the police are watching him, Foster has no choice but to arrest him without the knowledge of where Frances is & once in custody he refuses to say anything, will Frances be found in time before she runs out of air & why does her young kidnapper seem so clam, almost as if he is enjoying himself or maybe there are other less clear motives behind the events of the previous day...Written, co-produced & directed by Richard Shepard I thought Oxygen was a nice tight, taut little thriller that isn't the sort of thing I usually like but it has a certain something about it. The script at it's most basic is pretty gripping & absorbing as time runs out for Frances while Harry the kidnapper toys with the police & FBI, although I have to say once Harry is arrested & stuck in that room the pace slackens considerably. I would say that what Oxygen deals with is what many would consider their worst nightmare, being buried alive & slowly running out of air & perhaps more could have been done with this concept as it concentrates a little too much on the games played by Harry with the authorities. One more thing, Harry's precise & exact plans rely far too much on luck & things he simply has no control over to make me convinced that he could have come up with such an elaborate & implausible scheme. I mean his whole plan is based on the fact that he would be placed in one room, in that they would handcuff him in a certain way & that he would definitely be able to pick the locks, that they would agree with his demands to the absolute letter & that there is a air conditioning vent in the room just big enough to crawl through & that he could actually reach it as well as being able to keep total control over a hostage so they don't raise the alarm. That's an awful lot of coincidences & a whole lot of luck as well. The character's are well developed & fleshed out, they have a little bit more depth than usual I loved the monologue about the lethal injection from the FBI agent who was meant to be intimidating.Director Shepard does an OK job without being particularly outstanding, as a whole Oxygen is a little bland & forgettable but the solid story should paper over the lacklustre visuals. The film lacks any real tension or excitement but it does retain ones interest throughout, again thanks to the story. There isn't any violence to speak of except a gory gunshot wound at the end.Technically Oxygen is OK, it's competently made, there are a few nice New York shots & a couple of minor car chases although there isn't much action as it's a dialogue & storyline driven film. The acting is good especially from the two leads, Tierney as the cop & the effective Brody as the cold, calculating villain.Oxygen is a good thriller, it's short on action or violence but it has a good strong story to compensate. Personally I think it's well worth a watch.

Oh, and he thinks he's some kind of reincarnation of Harry Houdini.Thus begins Oxygen, a low budget made-for-Cinemax thriller that, I think, far exceeds expectations. First of all, Tierney, who very much reminds me of Lily Taylor, and Brody, who is impossibly young here, don't just chew up the scenery. They own this movie and make it their b*tch.At first, I was worried the movie would cave and ....MAJOR SPOILER... reveal that the husband was in on the snatch.

The two have a late scene in an interrogation room where they deliver volcanic performances.But once this psycho-thriller stuff is set aside, the movie comes to a swift ending. But right up to the end, you cannot predict what's coming next. Magicians, like Houdini, have things up their sleeve.Some terrific set pieces include a foot chase through a subway train in Steadi-Cam and a car chase in downtown NYC that is, though modest by French Connection standards, is still pretty ill.And, of course, there's the gritty and atmospheric NYC backdrop.

Not only is the story packed with suspense -- a kidnapped woman has been buried with a day's worth of air and it's the cops' job to find out where she is before she suffocates -- but the performances are better than what we've come to expect from yarns about the police. Furthermore, not ONCE is detective Maura Tierney asked to hand over her badge and gun! In fact, Maura Tierney is quite alright. She's a decent actress and she's right for the part of a policewoman so guilt-ridden that she has a secret lover who burns her with cigarettes and otherwise torments her. She's not a glamor puss either and I liked that too. Julia Roberts would have spoiled it, not through any lack of talent but simply because of her refulgent beauty.Adrian Brody was a big surprise too. He's the character who buried the young woman alive, killed his accomplice for no particular reason, and now sits in the interrogation room being alternately bullied and cosseted by the police and the FBI in order to get him to squeal about the victim's burial place. He has the face of a Dead End Kid and the whining, contemptuous demeanor of a spoiled brat. It's a hoot when the FBI takes over the case, the menacing agent enters the room, surveys the iron-bound Brody, and goes into this detailed spiel about how horrible it is to die from a lethal injection. Brody listens impassively for a few minutes then looks up with a twisted smile and remarks, What a stupid monologue. It's all so taut that you get caught up in the story, but it doesn't hold up well on a second viewing. First, you can't help noticing that there is a formulaic car chase through the streets of Manhattan and that it's lifted straight out of The French Connection. The two drivers glare at each other and try to bump each other's car off the street, while angrily yanking at the wheel.Then you notice that, as a matter of fact, the whole film is modeled on The Silence of the Lambs. Brody is a proletarian Hannibal Lecter -- smart, savvy, able to scan others for their weaknesses and then exploit them, an escape artist of a high degree. He teases the hell out of the cops, especially Maura Tierney. He promises to give her some hints if she'll tell him how she came by those cigarette burns on her arms.The problem is that Hannibal Lecter had a genuine reason for probing Jody Foster's psyche. He'd been penned up in solitary for years. And his curiosity was boundless. I mean, you MUST have curiosity as well as brains to endure the grueling routine of medical school, then psych internship, then years of private practice. But Brody's villain has no such motivation. He's as clever as a sewer rat but what does he get out of Maura Tierney's confession? Unlike Jody Foster's Big Reveal about the slaughter of the lambs, Tierney's isn't even particularly interesting. It's written flatly and Tierney doesn't bring it off.There's another thing that impressed me as slightly off on a second viewing. Maura Tierney commits homicide. She holds a gun on Brody, lying helpless in a pit, and she decides to bury him alive so she starts kicking dirt into the hole. But in the face of Brody's feculent mocking -- Oh, yeah, bury me, gimme more, MORE! -- she shoots him in the chest and kills him. That's not acting as an agent of justice. That's revenging yourself on someone for reasons of personal hatred, and it's usually called murder.

They only gave it 1-1/2*'s, but noticing that Adrien Brody and Maura Tierney were in the cast, I decided to take a look. One of the best aspects of this flick is the character each represents - two of the most weirdly fascinating, this side of Dennis Hopper and his companions Blue Velvet, or the cult classic Rory Calhoun opus, Motel Hell. Brody as the youthful, sort of nerdy-yet-wicked, braces-wearing, nefarious villain; and Tierney as the competent, dedicated, tough detective, with her strange compulsive, secretive nocturnal predilections, sort of a masochistic savant. Perhaps not great, and with some contrasting moments. Sometimes the cops here were more realistic and low-key than in most of this type of movie fare, and at others were the types of doophuses we see regularly, enforcing the law, in these flicks.All-in-all, a good 7* presentation, and not a bad way to spend the two hours' viewing.As a sort of imaginary sub-plot I couldn't help visualizing from early-on, I was hoping that Brody and Tierney might meet-up at some point - the confrontation between the quintessential sadist and masochist, respectively. I thought of dialog between them, replicating a joke I once heard the masochist says to the sadist, Hit me! (or, alternatively, Hurt me!). The sadist replies, NO!! (When they finally met in the interrogation room, there were a couple of occasions when I thought this just might occur.)

(If a movie doesn't grab me in 20 minutes, can it.)Was I surprised! Although a low-budget film, the acting was quite good & Richard Shepard (who wrote & directed) did an excellent job, grabbing interest quickly & sustaining it.The bad guy, Harry, at first seemed a simple-minded villain. However, although he was distinctly good at being an obnoxious sociopath (the terms do not always go in tandem, the seemingly affable Ted Bundy is a one example), he DID become far more interesting than I imagined -- much smarter than one would have suspected. We're talking gut smart, instinct smart, perhaps even intuitively keen. His ability to 'read' Madeline, to ferret out her true persona, to observe him honing in on her psychological dysfunction was fascinating.From the get-go, Madeline has your attention. Is she simply a cop driven to serve society & keep the ordinary citizen safe? Partially. Then we discover Madeline's secret side, a side her husband doesn't see but Harry latches onto almost immediately.I do remember stories of people being buried alive, especially since I'm old enough to have seen the original Vincent Price movies when first released & am familiar with the Poe fears and stories. As the victim, Frances (played very well by Laila Robins) is sealed in a wooden coffin covered with dirt somewhere apparently so isolated nobody near can hear her dog's insistent barking. Her fear is palpable & comes across with brutal reality. You hope she will survive -- but the outcome is questionable as time ticks agonizingly slow for her but too quickly for those trying to ensure her rescue. It's Einstein's relativity theory embodied in this very tense situation.On the debit side, more could have been done with her husband. His character was shunted aside too much for my taste what kind of relationship did they have & why was he so unaware of her darker side? An alcoholic problem is addressed fleetingly, but as any member of a 12-step group would know, one has to reach a base understanding of motivation to move ahead. Maybe they hadn't attended enough meetings.Summing up, 'Oxygen' was a surprising treat. It pulls you in quickly, deals quite well with complex situations. Although I shun violence, found myself wanted to applaud a violent act which I personally consider not to be an exception in real life.

The Houdini thing is cool, maybe too many characters and too much the director not wanting to say about them but to emphasize the Brody-Tierney cat-mouse, spider-fly duet and duel.I mean it's enough already with the Brody and Tierney clash, they sound better and more real than Clarisse and Hannibal cos she's sick and twisted enough and Brody sounds at the beginning so sympathetic..That's the advantage of no real familiar faces of bored stars, you feel more accuracy and real tension and you believe more in them..Tierney looks like Linda Fiorentino and acts sometimes like Linda Hamilton but there is something believable about her persona. Check oxygen plot in the original George Sluizer's Vanishing(the Dutch one), Very hellish heated New York atmosphere-more Oxygen theme here and appreciated the no rain (especially with everyone around quoting Seven ) but storm in the air and inside the people. I could live without the car chase -continued from the Friedkin thing-and felt good the bad guy was so bad -anyway, there are no really good guys in Oxygen-problem is you don't care too much about the woman buried-for me that's also the idea cos that's the premise-Tierney missing all the oxygen. Brody is managing to do a part that'll become a classic-there with the real monsters of the screen, and the whole atmosphere is very tense and dark, contrast especially felt in sunlight.I say again, I loved it cause I haven't heard about it so that's what you get when you check out something obscure.The director wants to say too much so he leaves himself breathless, the viewer too, but should have saved some oxygen to spaciate the film a little bit. Still, because of the acting and no-stardom and studio push-up's I think we're dealing with a minor classic, little but rewarding and more honest than most of the genre pieces we get these days. Probably in a year or two this movie comment space will be filled much more, I expect also some awards or some small cult following. I'm waiting for more from the cast and the writer/director-hopefully not Hollywood crap- but something in the same vein more carefully put together. Oxygen is both too much and too little, that's breathless for the moment and not so much in the end.

Then there were the absurd scenes that made me laugh out loud. For example, the FBI agent returning a nearly empty book of matches to the detective that Brody, the CRIMINAL, claims he stole from her. Why would an FBI agent take the time to do that? Why wouldn't an FBI agent consider the possibility that Brody could have placed a message inside (which he did)!!! Even the characters, IN THE MOVIE, commented about that being weird. Or the FBI agent's rant about the death penalty that was so over the top that even Brody's character had to say how stupid it was? And the crazy still shots of the seemingly not-at-all upset husband, looking small and forlorn? It was one crazy scene after another, all done with very artsy angles and composition (remember the cop reflected in the criminal's eye?)

How did the buried woman survive so long, and have the strength and presence of mind to attack him?Possibly the worst thing about this movie is how clever the writer/director obviously thinks he is. Does he actually believe we care if the killer and the cop are the same? They're obviously not - and how many times can that line be recycled?

It's true, that many of them are a complete waste of time, but what I really enjoy about them is that it gives people the freedom to do what they want, without Hollywood turning it into something it's not, and occasionally, I find a movie like Oxygen. This film was just your ordinary story of the police fighting against the clock and an insane criminal, who gets off on messing with them. It had a few twists here and there, but in general it was a very basic story, however what I did focus my attention on was the cast. Being that it's an independent film, two performers who I really enjoy watching, got to step away from their usual roles and try something different. Maura Tierney is usually cast as the emotionless girl with a troubled past, but in Oxygen, she's this crazy, self-loathing, tough as nails cop, who wears her emotions on her sleeve. She's opposed by Adrien Brody who usually plays the sweet, good-looking, exotic stranger, but not this time. In this film, Brody is a deranged psychopath who will do anything and everything to get what he wants. The dynamic and chemistry were both fantastic and I loved seeing two actors, that I know very well, step away from their usual roles and work on something different.

The resemblance is so obvious specially in presenting a female cop that needs to go to the level of the criminal, playing games that might haunt her for life - Clarice Starling, hello! This is the least of the problems. While trying to give to the audience some shocking revelations the movie failed with some inconsistencies that are so disappointing that you might feel embarrassed about it (the dog buried not barking and all happy to be in the coffin?

The police and the FBI are on the case, and one of the kidnappers (Adrien Brody) is captured.  He turns out to be a sadist, and -- what fun -- we already know that the detective played by Maura Tierney is a masochist.  So there ought to be fireworks.Sadly, there aren't.The script never manages to find the evil at the heart of Brody's character.  Nor do they successfully illuminate Tierney's shame.  You can feel the writers straining to get it right because the strain really shows.The other problem is that neither Brody nor Tierney are up to their roles.  Brody is shallow although he's never boring.  But Tierney (as much as I like her elsewhere) really falls flat.  These performances only briefly brush evil and shame.The only actor who breathes any real life into his role is Terry Kinney as Tierney's husband and commanding officer (and I believe that situation would never be allowed by the NYPD).  But he isn't onscreen enough to help the movie.And the whole time, the movie hurts itself badly by referencing the seriously superior The Interview in which Hugo Weaving not only found the heart of evil but laid it bare.  A movie this derivative shouldn't be pointing to its roots.  There's no real suspense on hand, no real psychological insight and no credibility.  It may be a movie milestone for upstate New Yorkers, though -- as far as I know it's the very first movie to make Poughkeepsie the scene of the crime.

The low budget didn't help. The cheezy cinematography didn't help. But it was the ending. The ending. Oh god, the ending. What a letdown. I give a lot of credit to Richard Shephard. He will make good films sometime soon. But what a crappy ending. As is the problem with most good thrillers, the villain is more likable than the hero. With everything so meticulously planned out, how could he not foresee the conclusion.Garbage.Again, I can only hope for better in the future from Mr. Shephard.Especially better endings.

I also quite enjoyed the on-location shooting in NY. Apart from these arguable caveats this is a film which, with the mad-hatter's tea party concept exposed half-way through the (undoubtedly excruciating) filming process, whoever was in charge of production lost heart and ran off the final cut thinking only of limiting the losses.Is the film the study of a schizophrenic thinking he's Houdini or an essay in dealing with self-destructing obsession? It doesn't know. Is it a The Silence of the Lambs bandwagonner? Of course, but looks more like a diluted TV spin-off. But the ideas are the good (well, OK) bit - there's a lot of potential in bringing characters' psychological issues into narrative parity with the more conventional thrust of the psych-thriller. Look at Jane Campion's In The Cut.No, the film is let down - dropped - by scrappy editing that undermines the acting (which is really very good indeed from both Tierney and Brodie under the circumstances), an excess of small, interpolated scenes designed to explain but which simply patronize and stun the pace - and then turn out to be cul-de-sacs anyway - and some of the worst continuity errors I've ever seen in a film. Ideal viewing for the cinematically mawkish 2/10 "},{"Title":"Watch this while doing something else","Date":"9 July 2005","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":" Warning this is an awful review so if you want to watch the movie skip to some one who wrote a good review or who liked the movie. Still reading? Here is how I would get through this piece of junk. What I did was get some work out and leave the pig rolling on in the background. I worried that the my work on my laptop might have suffered but I watched the pig and answered emails even with this diversion I still hated it. It was a study in futility. Bad Characters. Lifeless and unbelievable acting I mean truly awful. I feel bad for the folks who saw it in the theaters.OK so it had some great stars I liked looking at the film faces so I blame the director on this pig--Cut together like a story that never made sense to the director and if the editor convinced him to run it backwards maybe they could have saved the pig. The story line is a wanna be Seven With Brad Pitt. this so called female cop is boring.Again Don't blame the actors blame the director--He stunk this one up but good. In the end the stupid thing ends with the woman being saved and who cares. Watch it while your doing something else like waxing your car.

It's so bad I was about to leave the theater after 15 minutes of it, but I stayed, hoping it would get better (by the way, how come I saw it in a movie theater if it was made for TV?). The acting is bad, dialog is stupid, the premise is dumb, and you actually begin to think that you would be grateful if the woman died. You never really care about the characters, actually.It might be the worst movie I have seen in 2 or 3 years. It is that bad.

They deal here with a primal fear being buried alive.  But the film has no tension, no scares. Despite that, I could watch Adrien Brody all day.  I'd love to see him, with his off-beat good looks, in a lead role.  Maybe a buddy picture with Steve Buscemi. "}]
