To sum it up you have a murdered CIA hit-man who makes a deal with a devil, comes back as deformed creature with strange powers, and has to deal with a psychotic demon in clown form. Umm, yeah. Maybe Sam Raimi or Guillermo Del Toro could'be made such a film, but alas, they didn't, and the result is an inept production.I'll start with the good points; John Leguizamo is perfect as the Clown; both over the top and malevolent. And a few of the visual effects are impressive. And there were a few nods to the comics (Sam and Twitch making a cameo at the end). But that's about it. Here's every other problem 1. Michael Jai White just sucks as the lead. He's terrible. His interpretation of Spawn is not particularly heroic, or anti-heroic, or likable, or has any character moments, but is just an angry guy yelling I'mma gonna kill Wynn! Arrgg!! These powers rock! Gone are any of the philosophical underpinnings of the character.2. Hell and the devil Malebolia - laughable, laughable. They could've at least animated the devil's mouth to move in sync with his voice. If this is hell, I just laugh at it. And for those who say Hey, it was 1997; those were the visual effects of the time, I say look at Independence Day, Space Jam, and Titanic, all films made around the same time with superior effects.3. Martin Sheen, whom we all know is a good actor, adds little to the Wynn character. He concocts an idiotic plot about inserting a bomb in his heart, so that no one will dare kill him. This plot line isn't in the comics, but even if it was it would still've been idiotic. Doctors are really going to insert a bomb in someone's heart and not think Gee, this guy's gonna die someday, so there's no question this bomb will go off and kill people someday? 4. Child actor Miko Hughes shows up in a subplot, and has to look for Spawn's dog. WTF? It's like the producers realized We should make this more family friendly by giving Spawn a kid sidekick, but then realized there really wasn't anything he could do, so they had him go look for a dog instead.5. And after all this, we have a mess of a climax. Spawn fights off the Clown in Hell by transporting through the fireplace! And then we get the big clich√© about ending with a shot of Spawn looking out on the city he will now protect. Please. An unsatisfying ending, due to zero character development or reason to care about any of the saving that Spawn did throughout the movie.But there is some good in the world after all, I walked out of this knowing that if any demonic Clown comes after me, I sure can count on Spawn to decapitate him for me. And if my dog ever runs away, I can count on Miko Hughes to find him for me. And if I ever get confused during a movie, I can count on Nicol Williamson's tacked-on voice-over to provide exposition.And finally, if I ever go to hell, I know I can look forward to a place filled with cartoon characters.

When Simmons becomes aware that A6 might be a little shady, he learns the hard way that he isn't allowed to quit A6. This leads to his transformation into Spawn, a superhero with a background and motivations that are just as morally ambiguous as A6. The film largely concerns Spawn discovering and exploring his new identity, while working to uncover a nefarious plot and attain revenge.If you read my reviews frequently enough over time, you'll notice that my ratings often change on repeated viewings. My rating for Spawn has definitely gone down since my last viewing, but currently, I'm giving it a generous 8 out of 10. There are a lot of things that are brilliant about the film, at least for viewers with particular, odd tastes similar to mine, but there are also too many unfortunate missteps to allow for a higher score.Let's look at the missteps first. The main problem with the film is that screenwriter Alan McElroy and writer/director Mark A.Z. Dippe tried to squeeze far too much plot and too many characters into a 90-minute film. In retrospect, it would have been better to make one film covering everything up to Spawn's transformation (or the beginning of the transformation), and then save the other material (which comprises the bulk of the story here) for later films. Maybe Todd McFarlane, who created the comic books upon which this film was based, was worried that he wouldn't receive funding for sequels, so a multi-film plan wasn't attractive. As it is, there have been no live action sequels to date (there have been animated versions of Spawn), but I think there may have been if the first film would have been handled differently.As the film stands, too much time has to be spent explaining the plot. The A6 plot is complicated enough, but there is a very high-concept idea behind the creation of Spawn that also has to be explained, too. Also, a lot of characters, most critically Cogliostro (Nicol Williamson--one of my favorite character actors), are basically wasted. There just isn't time to get into them.A further problem is that both Sheen and White use odd affectations in their speech. I suppose it's supposed to be over-the-top in a comic book way, but on this last viewing, at least, it was more distracting to me. Also, a lot of the cgi-heavy effects already look very dated, and there's a weird cheesiness to most of the scenes in Hell. On the other hand, I personally like that kind of weird cheesiness, so I didn't subtract any points for that.And speaking of weird cheesiness, I'm sure a lot of people hate John Leguizamo's character in the film (Clown/Violator), but I love it. It's exactly the kind of surreal campiness--part horror, part humor--that I cherish. As Mike Mayo has said, he's like (an evil) Krusty the Klown on acid. That works well for me, but if you're not the kind of person who loves films like Killer Klowns from Outer Space (1988), you probably won't like this Killer Klown either.There is also a great campy quality to the material overall, including some of the dialogue (a scene where a father yells at a son in Rat City for spitting out a meal they retrieved from the garbage because it's wasting good food is a treasure). Spawn, the comic, is really a bizarre amalgamation of a number of different influences, from horror to twisted fairy tales, and the film is not afraid to indulge in that.The best part of the film, though, aside from Leguizamo's character, is Spawn as superhero. The costume and devices of the costume are fantastic, the cgi for the costume is excellent (I especially loved the cape), and White (as well as the stunt person(s)) does a great job physically. All of the action sequences involving Spawn were incredible. I wanted to see a lot more of that kind of material. In fact, the visual style of the film overall is admirably creative, all the way down to the opening and ending credits.In the end, the film teeters between being something that's so bad, it's good and being just a good film with some unfortunate flaws, but in either case, it's still very enjoyable to watch. You just need to approach it not expecting a realist dramatic masterpiece, but rather with a love for the absurd.

It could have been if they had inserted a prolonged torture scene of John Leguizamos Clown character one of the most un-funny, irritating and tacky comic relief characters ever to have (dis)graced the screen. Move over Chris Tucker and Pauly Shore - we have a new candidate for overrated quasi-comedian of the decade. The special effects were kind of confusing - half of them were excellent and half of them looked like beautified Sesame Street animations (the demon thing of hell, for example, which had me crying with laughter).

I had rented it probably as soon as it came out on VHS. I hadn't read a Spawn comic but knew one thing, he was a badass and a lot of people liked the comics. I had high hopes. Boy, was I disappointed. Now as the time has passed and I've gotten older, I've tried to like it for different reasons. For the campy aspect of it, for Leguizamo's part, for anything...I still don't.The effects are what they are, and you can't do much with a budget too low for your aspirations when it comes to a work like this. As it is, the suit and cape look pretty good, but it seems like those are the only things that any money were spent on. However, that is the least of my concerns for Spawn.The acting is...in a word...atrocious. No one other than Leguizamo has any fun in this thing. He's like the guy at a crappy party that says, Hey, screw it. I'm gonna have a good time whether the rest of you guys are or not! Did I like his performance? Not really, but you have to give him credit for trying. That's more than I can say for the rest of the cast, crew, pretty much anyone else associated with this. Jai White is awful. The script doesn't help him at all but he was just the wrong choice. That said, there probably weren't too many African-Americans at the time that folks thought could pull it off, so he was chosen. Wrong choice, but I guess you do what you have to. Sheen was so bad I had to watch Apocalypse Now again just to get the vision of Spawn out of my head. Sweeney and Randle....who? They were in this thing? See what I mean? The movie should NOT have been PG-13 either. We know well enough these days that even when a movie is put out in a director's cut on DVD with an R rating that it doesn't help much. Spawn should have been a hard R all the way from the get-go. It also could have helped itself being a bit longer, say 2 hrs total. But maybe it's the best thing that Spawn only tortured us for 90 mins. Any more of Spawn the way it is and you wind up thinking too much about Death's sweet release.Like I said, I really wanted to like it. I watch it when it comes on FX or whatever other TV channel just to see if I can find a reason to like it, so maybe I won't feel the disappointment I felt the first time.

The screenplay is a wreck, the acting is stiff and unconvincing, and the whole thing seems to fly by so fast, that we don't get a chance to experience much other than a look at some nifty visuals. In fairness, I suppose it is easy enough to argue that Spawn delivers its share of action sequences for a ninety minute movie, but perhaps it needs to back down a bit. It needs more story. In the end, Spawn feels like nothing more or less than an exercise in CGI and make-up effects.It is pretty difficult to get involved with the story, in part because it makes no sense, but mostly because we simply do not care. The character of Al Simmons is about as cheap and plastic as the armour he suits up in during the second half of the feature. Quite frankly I don't find him all that likable. He is cold and nasty, even as a superhero. I really hate it when the good guys talk like the bad guys; when they cackle or make snarly remarks, like Dr. Westlake in the Darkman series. Some of the special effects work, some don't. Our hero has a blood red cape which can expand to the size of Texas (don't ask me how). I liked that effect. The thing sort of has a computer generated life of its own, and its elegance clashes with the plastic of Spawn's armour. the primary villain is a clown from hell, who can turn into a ten foot armour plated beast which looks a bit like a cousin of the Queen from Aliens. That is another good effect. The climax takes us deep into the fiery pit of hell, which unfortunately does NOT so convincing. My screen saver is a more intimidating computer generated image. I was reminded a bit of the Brinstar level from Super Smash Brothers. Like so many films do, Spawn ends on a note that just cries out for a sequel. Needless to say, there isn't one and there never will be. Spawn is entertaining in parts, but definitely not as a whole.

Joining IMDb, and seeing it at a 4.9, I was astonished. But having been over twelve years, I decided to go out and buy the Director's cut. Just to be blunt, it's nowhere near worthy of the rating it's at. But, there is quite a bit of wasted potentiality. I'll start off with the good, which really there is a lot of if you think about it. First off, if you're really into action, look no further because this film sports a nice amount of it. And the basic premise is pretty interesting, but even the director's cut clocks in at under an hour and forty minutes , so it fails to dive any deeper than it certainly could've. The cinematography is by Guillermo Navarro, who many of you probably know from his work with director Guillermo del Toro ( Blade 2, the Hellboy series, Pan's Labyrinth, etc.), and he does a bang up job. With the right direction this could have been a masterpiece by all means. Mark A.Z. Dipp√© knew and carried out the bare minimum of film making, and if you look into it is busy now-a-days with animated Garfield productions. What a down grade, huh? About 90% of the visuals are pretty damn good actually, and the acting as it is is all right. For these things alone, I enjoyed this movie, where as I despised X-Men Origins Wolverine for its predictable generic storyline and overly done flashy effects. Michael Jai White was far from terrible and John Leguizamo was pretty terrific if not a bit cartoony at times.The bad points really hit this film hard. The pacing, attuned to its short run time, zooms by way too quickly with annoying video game like transitions and a score that didn't fit the film too well. Every time I was expecting more to be developed, I was let down. Oh, this is a cool plot line-wait, what, we're moving on already? oh..okay... And lastly, amongst 90% of the great CGI and make-up, the battle in hell is painstakingly terrible. They should've gone with an elaborate set and CGI here and there, but it becomes hopeless so you have to sit threw what you would call a lackluster climax.But for what it is, I highly recommended this movie for its dark humor and awesome action.

It has some dazzling CGI effects to complement its dark tone and breathe life into the Gothic fantasy, and wondrous cinematography to carry it out. Unfortunately, that's all it has to offer, which is a real shame, because this had the potential to be one hell (pun intended) of a movie.As a reader of Spawn comics and collector of Spawn merchandise (and affiliated McFarlane Toys products), I saw at an early age how Spawn revolutionized the comics industry with its mystical premise, graphic visuals, Heaven vs. Hell battle theme and gratuitous sex and violence, and while such gusto has been embraced by fans, this 1997 film adaptation of Todd McFarlane's popular underground comic, directed by Mark A.Z. Dippe', is rated PG-13 (subsequent home video versions were of the R-rated director's cut, which contained additional footage), the watered-down violence more cartoonish than graphic. In short, in the comic book world, Spawn is not like anything else out there.The story is that the demon Malebolgia needs fresh souls for his ever-growing army of undead soldiers to lead an eventual conquest of Earth, and then, Heaven, in what will eventually bring about Armageddon. All Malebolgia needs is a general for his army, and, Holy Lazarus, recently deceased CIA operative Al Simmons (newcomer Michael Jai White) has just the extra-crispy corpse for the job.See, Simmons was set up by his insane former employer Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen) after making a bargain with Malebolgia's go-to guy and Earthbound lieutenant, the pudgy, disgusting Clown (John Leguizamo, completely unrecognizable in his get-up), to kill Simmons so that he would be sent to Hell. While in Hell (which looks like a CGI version of a Marilyn Manson concert on steroids), Simmons makes a deal with Malebolgia to lead his army, in exchange for one last chance to see his wife Wanda Blake (Theresa Randle), who is now married to his best friend Terry Fitzgerald (D.B. Sweeney) and together the two now have a young daughter named Cyan (Sydni Beaudoin).Back on Earth and unaware that five years have passed, Simmons has a burnt-to-a-crisp visage that doesn't sit well with people not accustomed to undead soldiers from Hell. He establishes sympathetic links with the homeless denizens of alley Rat City, chiefly young Zack (Miko Hughes), and is watched over by the Godsend Cogliostro (Nicol Williamson). When Simmons's body comes out of its larval stage and transforms him into a Hellspawn, a being with an endoplasmic and invincible suit of armor, he sees his chance to use these new powers to exact vengeance on Wynn, his lethal vixen Jessica Priest (Melinda Clarke), reunite with Wanda, and seek a way to break out of his agreement with Hell.As stated earlier, Spawn is one hell of a special effects spectacle, and it looks great, but a lot goes wrong in too many places. I was dazzled to see one of my favorite superheroes on the screen nearly 10 years ago as an impressionable pre-teen. Now at 21, I am sorely disappointed by what I see today. Spawn still could have been good, even without with the full-on graphic content and Heaven & Hell mysticism of the source material. While a largely accurate reflection of the comics, it still gives more credence to my assertion that this is Spawn-lite. Presumably, studio bosses weren't keen on marketing a Hellbound superhero to the masses, so measures were probably taken to make the vehicle more accessible. (Take my advice and stick to the animated HBO miniseries.)On the plus side, Michael Jai White makes an efficient hero and this remains the actor's most well-known part. We do feel his pain (even if it seems forced at times), his quips, and overall faithful portrayal of the character. Sheen makes for a coolly sadistic madman but it's Leguizamo who steals the show. His gross-out-humor, maggot-munching portrayal of the Clown is just what takes this movie out of the dregs and into full-blown camp territory. Lastly, the soundtrack, a mix of heavy metal and techno, does have some pretty wicked sounds.It's easy to see that only core fans will want to stick with this picture. It had such a great chance to be something unlike anything else out there. With the comic book craze still in full swing in Hollywood, Spawn seems forgotten, or at the very least, sitting on the sidelines. But Spawn, to me, seems to be an example of mis-marketing, a brilliant idea gone haywire.

It was a comic, that for a while, made me stop reading DC and Marvel altogether.Of course this new found glory of a different kind of heroes and villains was adopted on screen as well, thus an utterly mediocre and very, very poorly aged schlock of a movie called Spawn, where everyone grunts and growls their lines and evil people are more evil than Dr. Evil from Austin Powers.The best things about Spawn is the suit of Spawn, which is pretty source accurate and John Leguizamo as vile, disgusting and nasty demon clown clown. I'd love to add Martin Sheen as a good thing, but alas his character is so clich√©d in all the evilness, that you can't look at him without laughing.The plot of Spawn is pretty simple. Al Simmons (Michael Jai White) is an A6 agent, who takes care of bad people by killing them. He's double crossed and he goes to hell, in where he does a deal with a devil and gets back on Earth as Spawn. A revenge ensues, and perhaps even some forced character growth and annoying kids as side characters.

He has battled thugs, drug dealers, pedophiles, murderers, the KKK and various creatures from the bowels of hell.If there is any comicbook character that is definitely not for young kids then this is it. Could this comicbook character be anymore badass? the material screams out for a solid ultra violent adult movie adaptation. How could anyone even consider the notion of making a PG-13 out of this graphic splatter fest! ahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!..bahaha!..haha...hehe...ahem...oh.I quite liked this despite many problems with the movie. Unfortunately this characters outing has aged badly showing some horrendous early CGI effects which will shock you. The visuals are generally decent at times, like the comic its very dark, Gothic and grim, but its also very obviously filmed on sets and looks a bit fake. Sure the cold night rain comes down in sheets whilst the mist swirls as Spawn leaps around in his fantastic looking living suit...but you need more than that. The other fantasy based creatures are also well created, Clown especially...very dark, humorous and quite chilling. Leguizamo played him brilliantly swinging from reasonably placid too nasty, vicious and perverted in the bat of an eyelid. Best thing about the film easily, kudos.The Violator is also pretty cool looking in a life size model form yet like a lot of the film the CGI version is pretty lame and ruins it. CGI is a problem with this film as its drenched in it, almost everything is CGI and frankly not much is any good. Jesus Christ even the opening credits are rendered in hokey-ass looking CGI! you can tell back in 97 CGI was the new toy.On the whole the CGI ranges from excellent on Spawns cape, to poor video game type visuals on most other things. Hell being the worst with a terrible looking Malebolgia and very plain unexciting looking backdrops, it looks like a student created it at home. The whole thing is very amateurish looking these days it really is, heck even back in the day it didn't come across that well. What's laughable if you look closely is all the legions of Hellspawns are clearly on some kind of animated loop as they all do the same action in the background! Its so obviously the same actor replicated a gazillion times, seriously poor.The best CGI is probably the work done on Spawn's mask, apart from his cape that is. The small sequences where we see his living suit/mask slide and form over his burnt face is still pretty slick even to this day. Sure his eyes look a bit too big and green but on the whole his mask does look the business. The fact its wet really gives it a living vibe, as though its pulsating, its one of things that does work in this movie.The acting is hammy with a slight serious edge, but in general its very cheesy. Sheen chews up the scenery and seems to enjoy himself whilst Jai White seems to be going for broke possibly after more comicbook roles. Clearly not expecting much here but this is suppose to be a dark violent franchise, lets try and be somewhat realistic and less camp huh. This film yearns to be harder and more violent (like the comic, what a waste), it is dark brooding and Crow-like for sure but its so watered down its quite painful.Despite that there is this uneasy feeling throughout where you're not too sure which way the film wants to go. Is it really for a wider audience? is it maybe more for adults? certain scenes seem quite risky and close to the bone but then at the same time its all so docile with no real visible violence or blood, realistic or otherwise. It gives the film an unbalanced feel because its lost somewhere in the middle which will leave both sides of the equation not enjoying the film. Like other similar comicbook franchises they must decide which way they wanna take it, its gotta be for kids or not, simple as that.Despite that it does have a certain charm which appeals to me, its dark Batman-esque world with hellish creatures and brooding anti heroes still manages to be enjoyable. Spawn being a very likable character, Wynn is also suitably creepy and Bishop is changed to a female for some reason but pretty hot with some nice gun/blade action.

One thing that is done in the Spawn film is it's just like the comic books in some sequences...almost too much - The characters do not interact quite they're supposed to, and the dialogue and action that make sense in a comic book do not work in a movie, if done in the way of this film (watch a clip or two, you will see what I mean).I know Violator is supposed to be crude and funny, but he is hard to put up with throughout the film. He makes The Joker look like a serious character, and his jokes are not funny. There were many opportunities throughout the film where they had the opportunity to present his dark side, and it was only done effectively for a few seconds, and then it becomes over the top.The animation in this film is very cheesy and needs work. I understand the year that this film was made, however, I would have gone with some live action in the areas where there is animation - it is just foolish and over the top. It was embarrassing to watch the demons in it move around so pix-elated and without the proper mouth movements.Unfortunately, I would not recommend this film to even the most die-hard of fans to the comic. The acting was decent but the way everything played out was overall very poor. The action isn't worth seeing even though it is a bad film (I thought myself it would be worth it for the action-it wasn't).

I had heard about this movie for a long time, it looked really good, and I just didn't like it that much. Let's start with the good things about the film. The special effects and CGI images were very cool. John Leguizamo (who played The Clown) was funny; in fact he was the best part of the film. And the entire look of the film I liked, it reminded me of The Crow, which is one of my favorite movies. Now the bad things about Spawn. First the plot didn't make any sense to me. Spawn is a man named Al Simmons who, when alive, killed people for the U.S. government. One day he decides he wants to quit, his boss (Martin Sheen) say ok, but then doubles crosses him and kills him. Five years later Simmons comes back to life. This is where it gets a little strange. Did he come back to life? Is he dead but back on Earth for revenge? Where exactly is he? It seems like he's right around the corner from where he used to live, but it never gets explained. And as good as the CGI was, some of it was too fast and unclear. The big fight scene in Hell just flew by, and it was very hard to see what was going on and who was fighting who. I remember sitting on my couch squinting, just trying to see what was happening. Even the opening credit sequence gave me a headache. These days studios are making films that look good, are filled with special effects, but have little or no story, and that's just not good enough anymore. Spawn had the ability to be a great movie. It was a hot character, the look of the movie was great, and the idea behind the character works, but the story has got to be stronger. When the best lines in the film are, Damn and Hell yeah, there's a problem. And what was up with the guy in the hat? I know what he was there for, to tell the story and to help Spawn realize bad from good, but he wasn't in most of the film, and when it came to crunch time, he failed. I'm a little tired of movies that look good but have no story. At least make the main characters people I can care about. I really didn't care if Spawn lived or died hell most of the time I wished he would join the dark side just to make the movie a little more adventurous. I have never read the comics, or seen the television show, but I hope they have a plot. If they make a sequel, I hope the first thing they do is write a good story.

Michael Jai White stars as the hero in the latest entry in this African-American, super-hero as-a-zombie movie-genre. Sadly, the filmmakers fail to deliver on the promise of those dazzling movie studio previews hyping Spawn as the next generation super-hero beyond Batman & Robin. Watching a rather predictable, synthetic, juvenile potboiler such as Spawn is akin to playing Trivial Pursuit. Director Mark A.Z. Dippe and co-scenarist Alan McElroy use the usual themes of murder, betrayal, revenge, world conquest, and self-sacrifice to embellish their heavily derivative, melodramatic script. Power hungry Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen) commands a top secret U.S. Government agency known only as A-6. Wynn dispatches the best assassin in the business, Al Simmons (Michael Jai White) to Hong Kong to liquidate some foreign politicians. Although Simmons completes his mission, he learn later that 26 civilians died in the explosion. Complaining about the senseless slaughter, Simmons demands reassignment. Before Wynn obliges him, he requires Simmons to help with the demolition of a North Korean factory producing bio-chemical weapons. Wynn double-crosses Simmons in North Korea, and Jessica Priest (Melinda Clarke) guns Simmons down. They abandon Simmons to barbecue in an inferno of spectacular explosions.Simmons recovers to find himself in Hell. After agreeing with Satan to lead Hell's armies when they assail the gates of Heaven, Simmons, who converts to Spawn, returns to Earth to see his fianc√©e Wanda Blake (Theresa Russell of Beverly Hills Cop 3). Meanwhile, a despicable character named Clown (John Leguizamo of The Pest) forges an alliance with Wynn. The Clown and Wynn plot world domination using a lethal super virus to wipe out populations. Secretly, Clown represents Satan, and they want to obliterate the planet. Clown convinces Wynn to implant a device near his heart that will prevent the release of the virus. The only way to trigger the epidemic is to kill Wynn. Clown stages Wanda's murder at the hands of Wynn and tries to provoke Spawn to kill Wynn and precipitate Armageddon.Once the world has been destroyed, Spawn can then spearhead an attack on Heaven. At the same time, Cogliostro, a grubby-looking knight from another era (legendary English actor Nicol Williamson of Excalibur) competes with Clown to get Spawn and use his powers for the benefit of good. Not only do the special digital effects smother the weak storyline, but these first-rate graphics also fail to carry the movie. The Dantesque version of Hell as island floating on a sea of fireballs is a stupendous as Spawn's morphing body armor and his cape. The travels down cosmic light tunnels are impressive, too. Nevertheless, the special effects endow the film with a video game look that often distracts from the narrative.Furthermore, the lack of suspense in the story cannot be overlooked. You know who is going to triumph in Spawn long before this science fiction saga ends, and the hero's strategy takes a backseat to the effects. In addition, poor character development hampers the dramatic elements. Dippe and McElroy devote little time to the subtle moral ambiguities that complicate Spawn's character. Spawn responds more out of a sense of revenge than any fight for the right. Worse, just about everything in Spawn has been tried out in other movies. Spawn's entrance through a skylight at a reception is straight out of Tim Burton's Batman. Spawn's suit resembles Spiderman's outfit, and Spawn's flying chains resemble Spiderman's web strands. Spawn's death and revival imitate those of Darkman and The Crow. Despite his meaningful dialogue delivery, White brings little vivacity to his role. His leaden personality and the latex outfits deprive him of any sympathy. White fails to radiate charisma, and the only reason that audiences want to support Spawn is that innocent children and small dogs trust him.If anybody qualifies as an unscrupulous villain, Sheen as Jason Wynn does. Sheen sports the black chin whiskers of a vaudeville villain and chews the scenery in a hammy, heavy-handed performance. He torches Simmons by contemptuously flipping a smoldering cigar into the flammable pool of green goo that engulfs our hero. John Leguizamo steals the shows as the grotesquely flatulent bad guy Clown. If Dippe and McElroy had portrayed all the Spawn characters as memorably as Clown, then movie would have fared better. Leguizamo resembles a maniacal cross between Humpy Dumpty and the Three Stooges rolled into one.The supporting cast gets little chance to distinguish their roles are so sketchy. Nico Williamson is wasted. As Cogliostro, Williamson mostly stands around and looks creepy under his broad-brimmed hat. Theresa Randle has the thankless role of the wife who does her share of screaming. Sexy Melinda Clarke as the evil priest manages to generate some character wattage as Wynn's sadomasochistic homicidal sidekick. She resembles Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman in the way her tighter-than-skin-tight black latex costume clings to her shapely physique. Aside from the positive role model potential that this movie may offer to young African-Americans, Spawn amounts to nothing special, just another tedious but high-tech fodder about a bittersweet champion in a cynical world. Only die-hard comic book adherents of Spawn may salvage something from this half-baked cinematic experience.

The other problem with CG is that it can date very quickly and I can think of few films that utilise so much CG so badly.Michael Jai White plays Black Ops bad-ass Al Simmons who works for shady Government boss Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen). When Wynn betrays Simmons on a mission to destroy a biological weapons facility in North Korea, Simmons is offered to chance by the devil to return to Earth as the leader of Hell's army and avenge his murder. But as Spawn, Simmons finds that things have changed. His widow Wanda (Theresa Randle) has moved on and now married Al's former colleague Terry (D.B. Sweeney) while Wynn has his hands on a biological weapon of his own and plans to use it. But can Spawn trust the devil's right-hand man Clown (John Leguizamo) or does he put his faith in the mysterious old man Cogliostro (Nicol Williamson) that seems to follow him about as well?Spawn is undoubtedly a triumph of effects, at least at the time. Spawn himself, with his vast billowing red cloak and glowing green eyes, looks pretty cool while Leguizamo is completely unrecognisable under a tonne of make-up and prosthetics. But its vision of Hell felt not just predictable but also very poor as the countless number of souls ready to wage war on Heaven look little better than computer sprites. And while the film-makers were focusing on flooding the screen with fancy visuals, they forgot to make the film interesting. Leguizamo goes from being creepy to annoying fairly quickly while Sheen plays the baddie as though he's only read the first page of Playing Villains For Dummies handbook. White, meanwhile, never convinces as the man who regrets dealing with the devil (he obviously never read Faust) while the character itself feels flawed - why did his gunshot wounds heal but not his burnt skin, for example? I'm sure the answers lie somewhere in its comic-book origins but in the film, everything seemed to lead to more questions and more special effects.I actually wanted to like Spawn but alas, it has let me down. I simply didn't care about the characters or the story because I couldn't identify with any of it. It's like a music video - full of cool moments and glorious visual prowess but lacking any substance whatsoever. With a more experienced director at the helm than Mark A.Z. Dipp√© (who's more of a visual effects supervisor anyway), Spawn might have been more than the fire-and-brimstone effects exercise that it actually is. As such, this is yet another wasted opportunity that reminded me of the live-action Guyver Dark Hero movie in that all you're watching is an actor in a silly suit beating up bad guys, probably in ill-lit and rainy back alleys. If you're looking for sub-standard effects propping up a simple action movie then Spawn might do the trick but genuine action fans should look elsewhere. Just because this is different to most other efforts shouldn't be the sole recommendation for a picture and remember, this was released just two years before the ground-breaking effects-based The Matrix. Ponder that as you wonder why Spawn doesn't use his apparently-limitless powers and relies on a couple of machine-guns instead...

Taken from a lesser known comic book character this film seemed to come out of nowhere in the late 90's and for all it's worth it does exactly what it say on the tin.Comic book films weren't as widespread as they are now. With the obvious Superman/Batman franchises there wan't much going around that was true comic book material.It's certainly not a great film. The acting s pretty below par (but never truly terrible). Martin Sheen seems to ham it up as the main villain and John Leguizamo bungles his way through the film as the Clown in a mixture of Danny Devito's Penguin and Tim Curry's Pennywise all injected with some quite cringy comic relief style humour. This is a shame because at times Leguizamo's clown is quite intimidating but the farcical nature and voice detracts from the dark atmosphere.The film has a strange look to it. Bit's of Batman, bit's of the Crow and bit's of a few other things. Ultimately it works and the dark atmosphere is pulled off quite nicely and has a quasi-Gothic feel to it but you're never quite sure exactly where you are.The worst part of the film has to be the CGI though. Spawns cape looks fake, it looks really fake although it does move well and the scenes in hell with Malebolgia are truly terrible, looking like they have been taken from a PC game that was released a few years earlier. This becomes all the more baffling when Violator finally appears from Clown and he looks great! The textures are bang on and he moves fine so I'm unsure as to why the difference in CGI quality is so vast between certain scenes?As a whole this film works. It's a comic book film and it does just that. It has plenty of action and Spawn is a really cool character with some deep issues. It maybe could have done more and been a bit more gritty/violent but as a film of this type its' a good bit of solid entertainment and is worthy of being in anyone's collection!

Michael Jai White is too over the top and the voice he put on for Spawn puts Christian Bale to shame. Martin Sheen doesn't even try. He knew this film, while not a flop, it just wouldn't 100% work. The CGI is terrible. This film came out the same year as The Fifth Element, Men In Black and Titanic and they couldn't do any better? The Hell scenes are a joke. They look like they belong in a PlayStation game. Also, Spawn's cape is just terrible.At times, you feel like you're watching a cheap Canadian TV movie made for the Sci-fi channel. Also, the climax of the film takes place in........ a sitting room. A sitting room? Really? Imagine if the climax of Lord of the Rings took place in a sitting room. Or Star Wars or The Avengers.So is there anything good AT ALL? Well John is fun to watch as Clown. He was the only person who needed to overact, not everyone else.

Films like these capitalized greatly on then-impressive special effects, slick cinematic style, frequent action, a dark and Gothic subject matter, and really awesome soundtracks. As cool as Spawn seems, however, it's nowhere near as cool as these other films.The coolness of Spawn is that it has a lot of action. It doesn't really drag all that much. It has a cool concept behind its antihero character and the overall story; one that offers potential for some epic special effects and some interesting plot twists. And, it has one of the coolest soundtracks on the market.The lameness of Spawn is that the dialogue is often very corny, the villains are standard megalomaniacs, the special effects are horrid (even by 1997 standards), a few parts are way too cartoony for its own good (especially regarding the clown character), the style of editing can be pretty erratic and weird, and the film overall is watered down for a PG-13 rating (even the R-rated cut doesn't really push the boundaries much).The thing I find most disconcerting is the execution of the story. The original story for Spawn is a pretty dark and compelling drama, on a level similar to The Crow. It was handled with just the perfect level of respect and quality with the HBO animation. This film takes the material, keeps the core story, but skims over a huge amount of the plot in a short runtime. As such, parts of it are rushed and choppy.Regardless, it does handle a few aspects appropriately. It is inherently compelling to watch the main character suffering betrayal and loss, before being forced to choose between vengeance and morality. It is a story with promise; it's just told in a goofy way.For what it's worth, the photography is not bad. The film is edited with some really weird and fancy editing effects, which can be erratic at times and stylish in others. With the iffy special effects, the film sometimes comes off as appearing rather gaudy. Still, the actors do their best Michael Jai White brings the Spawn character to life with just the right amount of emotional punch and machismo, while Martin Sheen, John Leguizamo, and Nicol Williamson all put on very hammy performances (for better or for worse). Despite the gaudy CGI, this production has fine and dandy sets, props, and costumes. Music is really awesome.I personally recommend the HBO cartoon version of Spawn first and foremost, for it is an excellent and earnest attempt at adapting the original comic. This film may have seemed right at its time, but after all this time it's apparent that it's mostly wrong. It does entertain, but interested parties would do better to rent it first and make up their own minds.3/5 (Entertainment Good | Story Average | Film Marginal) "},{"Title":"Spawn is a fun (but deeply flawed) little comic book film from yester-year...  Doesn't hold a candle to the comic or cartoon...","Date":"14 August 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Horror","Review":" (Note This review applies to both the PG-13 theatrical cut and the extended, R-rated Director's Cut, as they are virtually the same film. The only addition in the Director's Cut is about 90 seconds of additional on-screen violence.)1997's New Line Cinema release Spawn is based loosely on Todd MacFarlane's groundbreaking, violent comic book of the same name. Following a hero who died and was returned to Earth following a deal with a devil-like being, the film is a fundamental mess with enough style, creativity and cool visuals to make it worth watching once for fans of action and of fantasy.Michael Jai White plays Al Simmons, a military commando and assassin working for Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen), his commander who betrays him on his final mission. Wynn and his associate Jessica (Melinda Clarke) shoot Simmons, crippling him, and set him ablaze, leaving him to perish in a chemical-weapons factory in North Korea. Simmons is sent to hell for his violent past where he meets Malebolgia, the sort-of devil-like figure that rules hell. Simmons will be returned to Earth so he can see his finance Wanda once again (played by Theresa Randle) in exchange for training to lead Malebolgia's growing army of damned souls in a war against the light.Back on Earth, Simmons is discovered and trained by the evil beast Clown (John Leguizamo), an agent of Hell. Simmons' body grows an organic Necro-flesh body of armor and Simmons becomes a Hellspawn, plotting to use his newfound powers to seek revenge on Wynn. However after some dramatic events, Simmons/Spawn eventually realizes the error of his ways, and decides to use his organic armor and newfound hell-powers to fight evil and try to stop Malebolgia's plans.The acting is halfway decent. White plays Simmons well, although the character is never given much development. He's perpetually angry and in a state of mental imbalance, so he's just sort of in revenge-mode the whole film, speaking low and menacingly. Still, White does a great job. Sheen is actually a lot of fun as the villainous Wynn. Leguizamo is the standout performance here, though. He makes Clown hilarious and threatening, especially once we realize just how powerful he is (with an ability to transform into a monster seemingly inspired by HR Giger called The Violator). Other roles played by actors like Theresa Randale and DB Sweeney are well-played but fleshed out even less than our lead character.The production is a bit lacking, however. Director Mark AZ Dippe never quite is able to find the right balance for the story, with scenes alternatingly too juvenile and humorous before suddenly becoming dark and oppressive. His camera-work and shot compositions are also often compelling, but it feels like he shot the movie on caffeine as they're often very quick and lack deliberation. Combined with some over- editing, the film is a bit wonky. Production design is actually quite cool, especially the alleyways where Simmons calls home, which are Gothic and reminded me of Burton's original Batman. The costume and creature designs, however, are top notch. Spawn's bio-armor is glorious and very cool, and creatures like the Violator are eerie and terrifying. The special effects are a mixed-bag for the 90's. Most of the effects involving Spawn and his armor are fantastic, and Violator is brilliantly realized, but other effects (including sequences in hell) look too much like 90's video games, with block-y creatures and some poor uses of pixel-y, 2D sprites for characters in the background.My major problems with this film fall into several big points.First and foremost, the film is just too quick. At barely more than 95 minutes, there isn't any time to get yourself involved with the story, especially with the break-neck pace. The inconsistent tone and some truly juvenile, unfunny humor also break the pacing a lot. A lot of pointless scenes feel thrown in (like Spawn encountering Satan- worshipping teens at a graveyard) and pointless. And at times, the film does feel a bit too much like a movie. It feels too manufactured and movie-like during key scenes, which was in part due to an inexperienced director and because of limitations of the time.Still, this isn't a terrible movie despite huge flaws. It's merely an OK movie. I give Spawn an average 5 out of 10. It's imaginative and has a lot of cool ideas and visuals, but it never feels complete or fully developed. Give it a rent.

Needless to say, Sheen was seemingly hired to have an A-list name attached. Jai White is at his worst with his best Shatner impersonation, he comes off as surprised he even got the role and it appears that he was picked because he wasn't asking much for a salary. Actually, with his portrayal, he should have done a respectable thing and returned some of it.The movie depends too heavily on the outdated CGI and the production design than the actors and story. Then there's Leguizamo who seems so insecure that Dippe told him he was doing good. Keep that momentum. I see Oscars! And Leguizamo seems so gullible to believe he was actually stealing the show. There isn't really a show to steal. McFarlane should've exercised his clout to veto some of the director's choices like Jai White, single takes, and dependence on CGI which has not stood the test of time. I'm willing to bet, Dippe did a lot of the CGI himself to save money and that's why it looks so crappy. "},{"Title":"Expected more and got less","Date":"15 May 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Horror","Review":" Through comic book history, there has been a group of anti-heroes that belong to hell. My favorite was Ghost Rider, but after watching Spawn, I couldn't decide over who was better overall. Spawn is an anti-hero comic book character created from the mind of Todd McFarlane. As for the movie, I was hoping for it to be a little more than just satisfactory. And the only thing I can really say that doesn't negatively criticize it, are its visuals.Spawn is the story of an ex-assassin, Al Simmons, who was left for dead after his evil boss, Jason Wynn, burned him in an explosion. Its not until he is brought to hell and made a deal with Malebolgia to become the leader of Hell's army. Simmons is portrayed by Michael Jai White, and Wynn by Martin Sheen. White was a good choice for Spawn but there were some times where he sounded like he was growling more than talking and it just became tiresome after a while. Sheen was an interesting choice as the villain because of his acting style. Sheen is very smooth and it never seems like he's out of step with his character.One character that is less tolerable than the others, is The Violator, played by John Leguizamo. It's understandable that Leguizamo was only acting out the personality of The Violator, but it felt like every time he was on screen, it was just another drawback. Almost like Leguizamo's character was supposed to be stealing the spotlight. Not to mention that The Violator wasn't even that funny to begin with; just a nuisance. The action was good in this film. Of course, that's when Spawn was busy trying to get vengeance, which wasn't all too often. Half the time, Simmons was trying to get in touch with his past, which wasn't ever successful. The other issue was that Spawn didn't learn know how to really control his powers until the very end of the film. And as all origin comic book adaptations go, the superhero figures out how to control their superpowers quickly, but for Spawn, it takes an awful long time. But despite all these flaws, the visuals and special effects are the greatest things about this movie. The costume of Spawn is spectacular. Bright lime green colored eyes, a black suite of armor and a cloak that can be used as camouflage or to enhance anything he wields makes Spawn an awesome superhero. Another plus is how Spawn can form metal objects from his body. Even his costume has a mind of its own! It's a neat trick. The sounds are cool listening to as well. Hearing how Spawn morphs his skin can get the skin crawling. Also the Violator in his true form was cool to see in the real world as well. What I couldn't understand was the transition between the real world and hell. Whenever the screen is focused on hell, I felt like a video game simulation and not a movie. Another thing I would've like to see was Spawn being a rated R film; PG-13 just didn't seem like the right tone for this kind of story. The musical score was produced by Graeme Revell and sadly I didn't feel much from it either. There was music but no emotional connection. Todd McFarlane's comic book adaptation has ensnaring visuals and some decent action sequences but is weighed down by an unsupported soundtrack and a slow moving script. Viewers may also be turned off by Leguizamo's obnoxious character role.

The great thing that made this movie worth watching was the fact that they made Spawn look exactly from what he was in the comics. The make-up department deserves a thumbs up for this cinematic achievement. However, the story could have been better. The back-story of the character could have been expanded a little. Plus, the main plot could have been something else beside a deadly virus. The Clown villain was pretty demented but funny. His dialogue was a little clich√© but worth being a good villain.

Creating Dark worlds, with great characters and stories, he has brought people one of the darkest characters in fiction...Spawn. I haven't read too many of the Spawn comics, but they really are works of art. I was only a kid when the movie adaptation came out, and I didn't know who or what the Character was (I wasn't even supposed to since Spawn is clearly aimed and intended for Adults only). Apparently this film was quite hyped, mainly because of the way the visions of Hell were represented here, and because McFarlane was a big name in the Comic book industry back then. As a kid, I liked this movie. As an adult, I think its absolute crap. Why? You take the original concept of Spawn and reduce the great writing that the comic books gave you, to a watered down script serving the purpose of cashing in on the Armageddon theory? This film seemed to be one of many films that came out towards the late 90s, which dealt with the idea that earth was doomed in the year 2000, through more than one theory. This one deals with Satan, who gives Al Simmons (A government assassin who was killed by his own employer, after discovering a genocidal plot) the chance to go back to earth with new Hell-like powers, if he would join Hell's army. Communicating via The Violator, a wisecracking flatulent Clown who has the ability to shape-shift into a large monster from Hell, the Devil examines spawn and sees how Worthy Spawn is as a soldier. On the side, Simmons's employer has been able to get his hands on a virus that could destroy most of Earth's population were it to detonate. This allows the devil more of an opportunity to take control of earth.The comic books and the HBO TV Series (Which is an excellent, intelligent, well written television series, which surpasses this film in every single way) combined the film noir, horror and drama elements with a story that dealt with biblical, devilish and supernatural themes. Better written stories existed there, and something like that should have been used for the film rather than the studio approved script for the film.I will give the movie some credit, Michael Jai White did a good job of playing Al Simmons/Spawn, and you really could see a lot of emotion brought to the role.At the same time, John Leguizamo stole the show with his portrayal as the fat Clown, really bringing some life to the character. Some of the action scenes in the film was well directed but others just seemed to careless. The movie definitely has the Gothic feel and tone that the animated series offers but it hampers down as the more action oriented plot comes into play. Also, the movie certainly is good looking, with some great visuals (Especially the way Hell is portrayed, and the way the Violator looks), great art and set decorations; The story is the main issue with this film. It was sloppily written, destroying the potentially mind-blowing concept that the film starts out with, and ends up being a standard B-movie to cash in on a popular character of a popular medium. This certainly is one of the worst comic book films of all time. Avoid this film if you can, and instead give the comic books and the HBO animated series a chance (even if you are not a fan of comic books and animation) because those will not disappoint you.

Simmons has recently experienced some moral qualms about his line of work, but that doesn't prevent his boss Jason Wynn (played by Martin Sheen) from sending Simmons to North Korea where he should destroy biological weapons plant. The explosion is excellent opportunity for getting rid of Simmons who ends up in Hell. Years later Simmons reappears on the streets as Spawn - superhero equipped with morphing cape and claws. An interesting character named Cogliostro (played by Nicol Williamson) informs Spawn that he had struck deal with Devil - he could rejoin his family if he leads forces of Hell in upcoming Armageddon. Cogliostro wants Spawn to join forces of Good, but evil Clown (played by John Leguizamo) is always there to remind Spawn of his obligations.The Clown is portrayed as more of a comedian, than a villain which isn't necessarily a bad thing since he ends up even more likable than Spawn. Even though the movie follows battle between heaven and hell there are thankfully no real religious overtones here.

It works, in many cases, to great effect. Take, for example, 1994's The Crow. The entire film is enshrouded in darkness for its entire length, but possessed the material, the supplemental elements, not to mention the natural screen presence of its martyred star, Brandon Lee. It was dark, ugly, and beautiful all at the same time. Spawn is a film created with similar imagery - a honorable intention - but the attempts to duplicate the melancholic sentimentality of The Crow and the furious mix of slam-bang editing and relentless special effects creates more of a mess than it does a comprehensible, involving comic book fantasy. Michael Jai White, John Leguizamo, Nicol Williamson and Theresa Randle star the film adaptation of Todd McFarlane's cult comic, Spawn.Al Simmons (White) is a trained assassin sent on a mission by the government to a chemical weapons plant in North Korea. He soon finds that he is double-crossed by his own boss, Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen) and sent on a suicide operation to silence his knowledge of his boss' plans. He is blown up along with the weapons plant, and dies immediately. As soon as he is killed, he is sent to Hell, and is forced to make a pact with Malebolgia - Satan - to lead His army against the forces of Heaven and in return, he will be allowed to see his wife, Wanda (Randle) and his daughter again. Unfortunately, he is sent back to Earth in his exact form, scarred face, mutating body armor and all.His guide up on Earth comes in the guise of the scariest clown (Leguizamo) this side of Ronald McDonald. Clown continuously convinces Simmons, now known as Spawn (that should have gone without saying), that he will be able to see his wife again once he leads Hell's army against Heaven (this seems pretty useless... Spawn sees his wife several times throughout the film without having to lead a single charge against Heaven... he didn't really think his charred face would be in any way attractive to his wife did he?) Spawn is doomed to roaming the alleyways of New York City, living in a broken-down hostel plotting bloody revenge against Wynn, all the while trying to elude the wisecracking Clown. Spawn finds a reasonable conscience in Cogliostro (Williamson), who tries to convince him that Satan is only trying to manipulate him to lead the army of Hell. Still, however, the prospect of gaining revenge on Jason Wynn is too tempting for Spawn, so he goes ahead with his plans to find him. However, his conscience progressively grows on him, and realizing that he may never be able to be with his wife again (oh, ya think?), Spawn seeks out a new purpose on Earth, to turn his attention to serving Good over Evil.It would be unfair to call Spawn's plot weak, for there are several angles to it that, in another film, might provide for a riveting and involving story. Unfortunately, this film is directed by former ILM employee Mark A.Z. Dippe, who resorts to a relentless bombardment of violence and (eventually) unnecessary special effects that rob the film of its comprehensibility and make it tiresome. The film starts off brilliantly, with a spectacular and stylish title sequence backed by the Filter remix of Crystal Method's Trip Like I Do that could rival the likes of Se7en. From there, the film never improves, suffering from a weak script, scene-burglary by John Leguizamo (who, luckily, is given a number of witty lines here and there) and an overabundance of reality-defying effects. The whole film is loaded with them, from Spawn's cape to the least convincing vision of Hell since Deconstructing Harry; as if there weren't enough already, Dippe includes fire-wipes to move his film between scenes, perhaps a muse on the Batman TV series, but coming off as super-saturated in a film dogged already by fiery effects.The film is not a complete failure; there are hints at effective work in certain places. Some of the production design functions appropriately, especially the rooftop of a Gothic cathedral upon which Spawn makes his home once he is sent back to Earth. The colors of Spawn's cape and the millions of other colorful characters function well in contrast with the dark backdrop of a New York City evening... unfortunately, they are not consistent, and are barely noticeable in an attempt at a passionately dark film which eventually degenerates into a hyperkinetic mess of fire, violence and bombastic vocal delivery. This is the sort of film that one examines with a sensitive eye, hoping that the directors, writers, and the rest of the crew look at and improve upon. Indeed, there is hope in Dippe's work, and will undoubtedly make a captivating film with the benefits of edgier, more experienced screenwriters, technological advances in digital effects, and slowing down the action to create a consistent pace... keep that soundtrack though, the score and the accompanying soundtrack are just fine. 2 stars on a five star scale.

My question is why didn't they reshoot the action sequences for both PG-13 and R rated audiences.  They released it as a director's cut on DVD, which I feel wasn't even worthy of being rated R to begin with.  They should have had the violence more intense and bloodier for the Director's Cut.

The Spawn effects are absolutely stunning and the atmosphere is a gripping sort of Techno-Decadence.If I have one complaint about Spawn, it is that despite all of the mournful wailing about Wanda and the prevalent romantic sub plot, you never really sympathize with any of the characters. The premise of the film is such that you really wish that all this plot-matter would be dropped, and you could have more action.

After seeing the movie, I could see why it was disappointing. The story and character of Spawn is very intriguing. He is not just another caped,quasi-iconoclastic superhero that graduates from comic book page to silver screen. He was a government-hired killer whose contract had been terminated. Recruited by the legions of Hell to lead them in a showdown of good vs evil, he hopes to see the girlfriend he left behind. But he is bested more by revenge and bitterness than by sense of duty, and therefore he is still prone to psychological and spiritual torment. This portrayal seems to be the difference between the movie and the comic book. And for the movie, this personal baggage is more a departure point in favor of action scenes. This is why SPAWN doesn't work. Of course action scenes have to be the center piece of a comic book movie,but they don't have to be slave to it. Wouldn't it be just as well,if not better, if the exciting battles could be incidental to the hero's plight rather than just obligatory? Not surprisingly, this movie is more content with just showcasing special effects. Fine, most audiences are satisfied with that anyways. The problem is,the special effects in SPAWN are a huge letdown, confined mostly to the ubiquitous CGI used to show the flights,fights and infernal backdrops. The cast is equally as predictable. Spawn is played by kickboxer Michael Jai White whose physique and stature would be logical, but whose performance is as good as can be expected. Martin Sheen as the mortal villain, just plays a hammier version of the same type of character he did in FIRESTARTER. And Nicol Williamson follows suit from his Merlin in EXCALIBUR. The movie's main villain however is the Clown/Violator(John Leguizamo). Though flamboyant, attempts at comic relief are confused. His many appearances in the forlorn but stagebound settings make SPAWN more reminiscent of the NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET movies rather what was intended from the comic book. Maybe Todd Macfarlane should literally go back to the drawing board on this one.

That segment is very original and could have been an opening for a James Bond movie. They have of course more money to develop this opening but the Spawn opening could have been a good rough cut. Another great scene is the transformation of the Clown into the Violator. The whole Violator segment has quite a horrific tension. The transformation of Spawn during the whole course of the movie is very convincing, you could believe that he has been build by necroplasm. Melinda Clark is not only very beautiful but terrific over the top as the assassin Jessica Priest. I do not understand why they killed her in the first half of the movie. The tension between her and Spawn could have pulled this movie to another level rather than sticking with Martin Sheen as the dull unconvincing crime-lord. His acting is as stiff as the make-up on his face. On the other hand this movie has some serious failures. There is absolutely no development of caracter. They are as flat as a piece of paper. Their dialogue comes directly from the comic-book. The acting is as wooden as my front door. The SFX of  Hell, Malebolgia and the final confrontation scene is the worst I have ever seen.

Last but not least the character of the Clown is so annoying that you have to have a real good stomach to swallow his crap.

My roommate and I went to this movie with total anticipation. His standards for movies was lower than mine and he's a graphic designer. We both walked out of that movie and wanted our money back it was so bad. I have heard people say that it was good for it's time as far as make-up and special effects, no way. Titanic came out this same year. Different movie, budgets, etc, however look at the standard of movies that year and even before this. Add to this the fact that people like Tim Burton, Richard Harris, Ed Norton, Wesley Snipes were supposed to work on this movie, the end result looks like a half-ass effort that they had to produce. This movie could have been good if the people who made it had the guts to make it as extreme as the comic.At least the cartoon that came out later had more redeeming qualities.

It's quite strange how they could make the film so bad, especially when you consider the fact that it was potentially good.There was a range of characters whom I had no recollection of. Most of them came out of nowhere, with no explanation, character development, or identity. The only name i knew was Spawn and there were only a handful of characters who's purpose was made clear.The evil clown is possibly the worst character I have ever seen. I hated every moment he was on screen. Spawn, in his full outfit, looks quite cool, however, for the majority of the film, he is shown with no mask, just a burnt face resembling dry spaghetti bolognese.Nothing actually happened in this film. The whole thing was just Spawn figuring out who he wanted to kill. Which he could have done at any point. Maybe they should have put a little message at the beginning of the film saying Read the comics first and you might have some idea of what's going on.The film work is visually dull and boring, and most of the technical aspects seemed to rely on special effects. A lot of the stunts, make up effects, and props were replaced by CGI. Even Spawn's mask, was superimposed at some points. I'm not usually one to base a film on the quality of the effects, but if you're going to use CGI in almost every minute of every scene, then it needs to be better than playstation one. Plausibly the effects could have been taken from the Spawn game.For a film, this was the least cinematic looking thing you could view. It's safe to say, I missed this when it was shown in cinemas. I can't imagine how little of an experience that would have been. The opening credits felt like I was watching a video on youtube.I actually wanted the film to end so badly. I didn't even care about what happened. If the DVD had blown up I wouldn't have been at all bothered about missing the ending. I watched this, not because I thought it would be brilliant, but because I liked the look of the concept of Spawn, and I like horror and comic book styles, leading me into thinking Spawn would be fairly enjoyable. If you feel the same way, I recommend not watching it. You will be incredibly disappointed, and maybe a bit depressed.(I only gave this 2/10 because i have seen Psycho From Texas.)I hate it.

ALAN McELROY is a talented writer, but overall was the wrong pick as the writer of this fable as he seems to have trouble matching the action & dark tones of the comics.

I will say John Leguizamo played the part of Clown extremely well as did Martin Sheen as Jason Wynn, though he overacted in some parts. But the few good things don't overpower the many bad ones. Instead they focused not on the real first days of Al Simmons (White) being Spawn, instead they jump from it to some stupid and lame story which had nothing to do with him as a character at all.

And I could buy into the Spawn character, even his mentor-what's-his-name.  No one else in the film gave me a performance I could buy.  Sheen and Clarke pushed the film too far into cheesy comic-book camp territory.  That and the Priest character's wardrobe . . . what the hell was she supposed to be?  An obsessive killer who likes funky futuristic armor?  She seemed way out of place beside the Wynn character . . . maybe if she was more with Clown than with Wynn, but I wouldn't know because I don't read the comics and that detail is never really explained in the film.  Despite implications otherwise, I'll give her the benefit of the doubt. Spawn never seemed to get comfortable because of these character, choice wardrobe and setting.  It never wants to be camp and it never wants to be entirely serious, but it can't find the exact blend of the two so it bounces back and forth hoping it'll get lucky eventually.I smell a film that desperately needed the Danny Elfman touch.  I honestly don't remember a thing of Revel's Spawn score . . . which is a rarity for me.  Good points - it is a nice break to have good and bad guys who are ugly to look at.

Spawn is a very dark and sinister comic about a man who has lost his identity and fights for what he thinks is right (don't confuse this with good/evil in a heaven/hell kind of way). We're only at the beginning of the whole saga where Al Simmons is making his deal with the devil (or is he?) and finding out about his new powers. One thing that still bothers me (after reading the last fifty or so comics) is that I can't figure out why Spawn must lead the devils army into Armageddon. Why must one man trigger the disaster? Why not just barge in on the army of heaven and destroy earth in the process? Because of rules? Are there any during wartime? It's not explained in the movie and you just have to take it for granted that he's needed.Spawn is a character full of non-human powers which he uses occasionally, so room enough for some stunning effects...But everybody is having a field day on the bad effects. And everybody should. I can live with the effects on earth. They're not good, but not very disturbing, but the animations of hell... Malebolgia is pure animation, and it shows. Not even the effort was taken to synchronise the lips of this devil. And then the fight between Spawn, the Violator and Cog. How ugly can you make it? Was is shot in 1997? Are you sure? It was released in 1997 but it looks like to shot in 1897. I'm surprised they didn't use stop-animation.Further more I think Michael Jai White is playing his role far too much like your ordinary super hero. Spawn isn't a 'good' man. He's for gods sake a soldier of the hell. And besides that, he's in real pain, burned skin, an alien suit is taking over his body. This man is seriously suffering. But by the looks of him, he thinks he's Superman and holier than the pope himself.I'd say, shoot the movie again. Take your time, at least 2,5 hours. Make it a real horror movie. Step away from the rest of the super heroes, like the comic does.

On the other hand, Williamson and Sweeney are dreadfully underused.  The F/X are incredible (except for the final Hell scene, where they're so blatant as to make the action unviewable).  The movie suffers mostly from the 90 minutes running time - a lot of the more interesting stuff is compressed and/or seems to have been dropped in the editing room.

Al makes a deal with the devil and comes back to life with super powers. He also has a fat demonic clown (John Leguizamo) following him around. Oh and his beautiful wife is now married to D.B. Sweeney. The horror.Michael Jai White is an actor with a strong physical presence. Unfortunately, he can't act to save his life. To compensate for this, the filmmakers cast the deplorable John Leguizamo opposite White. Presumably Leguizamo's campy, obnoxious comic relief is supposed to balance out White's blandness. The worst part of the movie is Leguizamo. His character, Clown, is unendingly irritating and repulsive. In one scene, Clown craps himself and pulls out his stained underwear to show that he left skid marks. I will forever loathe John Leguizamo for this alone. The rest of his crappy career is just more fuel to the fire.Martin Sheen also hams it up but he was always overrated. Nicol Williamson plays the clich√©d wise man character who guides Spawn. He gets to narrate the movie and is insufferably pompous. Not all of the cast is bad, though. Theresa Randle and D.B. Sweeney do the best they can with the material given. Melinda Clarke is the highlight of the film as bad girl Jessica Priest. Though highlight might be too strong a word. She's the least awful, let's say.The CGI effects are cheap and embarrassing for a theatrically-released movie. For a movie based on a comic with flashy art (the writing was always weak), you would think this would at least LOOK good. But no, it looks tacky and very '90s in the worst way. This is really garbage, folks. Just avoid it unless you are into self-abuse.

Spawn is unforgettable, he wrote, and at the time, 15 year old me, tended to agree. Being somewhat of a comic book sci fi fan, i of course had herd of spawn, but never read the comics. So i went out and picked up a few back issues, and thought that the story was instering, and dark,something different. Unfortuntley, the film does not hold up at all to the comics, in my view and is dashed with some really bad special effects and pacing.First thing thats noticeable, is the lizard skin al simmons has for flesh. Now, I'm no doctor, nor a big horror fan, but i don't think rotten decomposing burnt flesh should look like a rubber mask. To me, it should look like torn scorched flesh with ragged chunks of skin and torn ends all over the place, barly able to hold onto the skull. unfortuntley in the film, it just looks like a rubber mask and it just sucks, because it could have been gross but cool at the same time.Another thing is the films special effects. Granted, it was made back in 97, when CGI was still in the new, but i mean, common, I've seen better effects in old playstation 1 games and cheepley made fan films. I guess the effects budget was slim, but honestly, I've seen better pre production animatics and these things are finished shots? Wow, talk about bad.Also, i had problems with the pacing and acting. Spawn just came off as a pissed off black guy with a bunch of one liners, and clown was way over the top and just dumb and annoying. Granted thats how John lequozomo (sp?) does his humor, but, this was just annoying. Hell, at least jar jar binks looked somewhat realistic, clown just looks bad. Also, the film never let us soak in the plot points of the story, it was just constantly jumping around from one action scene to the next, and just throwing in plot points simply to set up the next action shot. Its just a shame because there was a good story there, but, the direction and editing just tossed it to the side line. Granted its a comic book film, but it just felt to rushed even for that type of film.Overall, spawn was a good concept that went bad. Its not as bad as battlefield earth or gigli, not in the least, but, with the idea and some time and real effort, it could have been great. Maby if they went back and re did all the special effects and completely re cut the film, then,it could salvage it, but thats very unlikely "},{"Title":"Different and twisted. Yet lacking.","Date":"1 June 2004","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Horror","Review":"  When Spawn was first released, I was in awe. I watched the film twice in the same day, I thought it was so good. I remember thinking Spawn was the coolest superhero ever and I still do. But with the release of Blade, X-Men and Spiderman, Spawn is no longer the best superhero movie. But it's very different and entertaining.Al Simmons (Michael Jai White) is a highly skilled assassin/covert-op for A-6. An organization run by the insane Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen). Simmons is sent out to assassinate various political figures for reasons which are pretty much clouded to him. Well, Wynn keeps them clouded and Simmons misinformed, so that he'll think that he's one of the good guys, when he is in fact not. But Simmons is beginning to catch on and wants out. Wynn, however, manages to convince Simmons to take one last mission.During this mission however, Wynn betrays Simmons and kill him. Up to this point, the story has sounded quite normal right? It could be a sequel to Sniper or something. But here is where the twist begins. When Simmons is killed, he is sent to hell. And there he promises the devil, Malbolgia, to do his dirty work on earth and many other things. The plot is complicated to explain, but not to comprehend. While watching the movie, you understand it without problems.There are quite a few characters in this film that occur throughout the movie. Almost all of them are underdeveloped, but we still get to like some of them. The most memorable one being The Clown, played by John Leguizamo. The Clown appears once Al Simmons/Spawn is sent back to Earth and explains this and that to Spawn about what has happened to him and what is to come. Throughout the film he manipulates Spawn to do things Hells way, even if that's not quite what Spawn wants too since he is a good guy at heart.The Clown cracks some hilarious lines throughout the film. I kept bursting into laughed almost once every scene in which the Clown occurred. Leguizamo plays him splendidly and turns him into one of the funniest characters ever. Other characters are not so likable or enjoying tho. Most of the acting is actually downright bad. Martin Sheen, even though he is a seasoned vetera, does not really give a very good performance, but it holds up in a superhero film. Michael Jai White is not Oscar material either, but I have trouble imagining anyone else in the role of Spawn. He does his job well, even if it's not great. Most other actors in the film, except for perhaps Nicol Williamson, deliver plain or just flat out bad performances however.The CGI, which this film relies heavily upon, is splendid sometimes and bad some other times. In the Earth scenes, where most of the CGI is used to display Spawn's armor, the CGI is great. Most of it even holds up to this day. But in the Hell scenes, it's quite ridiculous, however. The CGI is really had here. A child could tell you that. But the Hell scenes are few and far apart and they get the story along. So at least they are entertaining.The action scenes are quite different, really. Sometimes they rely on Gun action as Al Simmons/Spawn boost various kinds of machine guns to clear out rooms or such. Come to think of it, those scenes do make me think of Punisher, however they are not nearly as bad. The best action scenes are by far when Spawn uses his armor to fight his foes, I can tell you that.So, the bottom line is This film is very entertaining, but lacks in some fields. If you want a deep intellectual movie, look somewhere else. If you want a good action flick, take a peek here. And if you want a very different and twisted superhero flick then you definitely must see this one.7/10  "},{"Title":"Its a good movie for the comic book genre","Date":"22 April 2002","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Horror","Review":"  This is not a great movie and is certainly not for young kids, but it is a good movie if you like the source of it and other movies based on super hero comics.

Spawn is a lame character anyway - visually, he's a just cross between Batman and Spider-Man, two characters who Todd MacFarlane worked on.

I remember it being bad, but wow, I forgot just how bad it was. Now I was never a fan of the comic, yeah I picked up the first half a dozen issues because at the time McFarlane was the man as in the hottest artist in comics. Of course I later realized he was also the biggest ego in comics and it showed in his deals with comic companies. Over the course of a couple years his ego wrecked a lot of good comics and eventually he left to do action figures (very very high quality) but i digress. Spawn is basically the antihero taken as far it can go, the anti hero is a dead mercenary who no one liked and the devil gave incredible power too for reasons that make not a lot of sense and the hero refuses to be the bad guy... sorta. He's not likable, hes not a good guy, he's basically a massive jerk who's only redeeming factor is that if he had the motivation to be evil the world would suffer, but hes too much of a jerk even to be evil right. in the comic version Spawn's powers are classified as yes, like the old Superman comics, Spawn's powers are limited only to what the story needs. Can he fly? Umm sure, this issue he can. Can he be invulnerable, yeah this time, but not next time, why? Dunno, don't care, McFarlane draws, and the story is written around the art. The movie seems to work the same way, Give me cool special effects and we'll write a story around them seems like what the director said. Sheen is apparently paying off a gambling debt, Leguizamo was working for the paycheck and barely acts, heck most of the cast seem to give up halfway through and just decide to get to the end with as little effort as possible and deny knowledge of the project after that. The CGI is low end craptastic stuff (real cheap 90's Amiga work here). The ending is ho-hum and could have been better written by the average 8 year old after just showing him a couple of the comic covers. Are there worse comic book movies? Yes, but not many. If you are thinking of buying this movie, or even watching it, I suggest a bottle of your favorite 80+ proof beverage to dull the pain. If you manage to actually enjoy this film then I suggest a career in the S&M industry or that you see a good psychiatrist.

John Leguizamo is outstanding as a demonic clown despite conventional placing. Martin Sheen is standard as a corrupt government official in what is really a big disappointment.

Dipp√©Storyline We then see a masked man kick in the door at an airbase and shoot up the people inside it before setting up a rocket launcher to assassinate his target. You see him wearing night-vision goggles that have unrealistic zoom, but also give him eyes similar to that of hellspawn, so it is foreshadowing in way. After 5 minutes or so of opening credits we get to see a news report covering the rocket attack, we're also introduced to a fat guy in the shadows who is talking with the head of some assassin service that is making a biological weapon. Al Simmons and his friend go to visit the head of the service to show his disdain at the fact of him having to kill civilians, he wants out and is sent on a final mission to take out a bio-weapons plant in North Korea. Simmons gets to the main part of the plant but finds out it was a trap and is betrayed by the people he works for and sent to hell. Simmons is then brought back from the dead but is still completely disfigured because of the burning and has to live among the homeless and the same guy from the beginning gives us exposition of what is happening and why Simmons was brought back. He then has to go through training or sorts with Clown/Violator a short fat demon who ironically hates clowns, this character is what I like to call painful comic relief. The Violator makes him go through flashbacks so we can find out what happened after he died, and it turns out he made a deal with the devil which had strings attached. He is then taken into another flashback of when he rises from the grave and scared a couple goths who were hanging around the graves. This is also the part where we get to see the actual Spawn suit as the memories came and eat away at Spawn. The bad guy and Spawn's old friend Terry have gone to a party full of world officials. This is when Spawn breaks in through the sky light, tries to kill Jason the big bad. Spawn gets to Wanda's house where there is a trap waiting for him, an interesting little twist is there as well, but after Spawn does the right thing, he then kills the clown after battling with him in hell and sends him back to hell. Acting Michael Jai White is a great choice for Spawn, he is able to present the sorrow and aggression that the character would be feeling. He wears the cloak of Spawn and owns it. It would be hard to top his performance, I also think than not even Snipes could have hit the nail on the head as White does. My feels about John Leguizamo as Violator have been mentioned earlier how I have nothing against the actor, it's just the fact I do not like the character, but regardless he comes across as vile, vulgar and vicious. Just how the character should be, so he is a good actor in this. Noticeable Camera work The voyeuristic shots from the birthday party scene are where we first start to see the decent use of camera angles, before this it is the standards of close ups, mid shots and wide shots. This is an interesting thing that the movie does, it has Spawns cloak cover the screen so it can be used as a transition, this is nicely done and is a piece of editing not camera work, but is still creative as all hell. The scene that takes place after the police scene is a great shot, it has Spawn standing on the edge of a church with his cloak blowing in the winds, it works well regardless of which dark caped crusader does it. Be it Spawn, Batman or (Insert other dark brooding caped hero here)Graphics The CGI hasn't dated too well on this movie, but the effects are very nice to look at but not all too realistic for the most part. The world leaders meeting scene has Spawn breaking in through a sky light and his cloak stopping the fall, his cloak does look blatantly CGI, but it looks majestic as all hell, so I don't really care that much. The CGI for the violator's transformation scene is well done similar to that of Spawns transformation and stands up to that of late 2000's CGI. There are also some popping eyeballs that look like they are from the mask. Costume We are first introduced to the suit in the grave scene and apart from the cheesy CGI green lightning the suit is BA to the extreme in the way it looks like suits that are made for today's movies. It looks similar to the venom symbiotic suit in Spiderman 3. It matches the comic suit perfectly as well. My only complaint would be that he spends most of the movie with his mask off and I have a feeling that White asked for this so he could have more screen time, similar to what Stallone wanted in the movie Judge Dredd. That or voices couldn't be heard that well from it. Overall Feel Just a couple interesting facts about Spawn, the first being this was the first superhero movie to feature an African American as the lead character, there is the movie 'Steel' which came out a fortnight after which also had an African American lead superhero. Wesley Snipes was considered for the part of Spawn, but that was handed over to Michael Jai White instead, Snipes would then go to play the BA vampire killer Blade the year after. Also I will warn you now, this movie has a number of god awful puns with some puns which are actually good.

The extremely graphic and violent images, helped by clever zooms and decent special effects were also very well done. I also liked the cameo from Sam and Twitch at the end, which will be likely to please fans of the comic.However, there are a lot of things that didn't work. I for one found the soundtrack intrusive and generic, and while the visuals were great the direction for me was not, it needed a little more subtlety.

Also while I had no problem whatsoever with Leguizamo, I cannot say the same for the remainder of the cast. Martin Sheen is given very little to do as Wynn, while all Michael Jai White manages to do is act brooding, instead he forgets to act.

He wants to leave the business so he can stay close to his wife and bring up their child but of course things don't work out. He's killed by his boss and is sent to hell for his crimes against humanity. In hell he makes a deal with the devil to be able to see his wife again, Wanda. On one condition that he'll lead the devil's army to the gates of heaven.Al is sent back to earth as hells spawn (demon soldier). Here he must decide either to choose the path of good or evil.There is no back story for any of the characters but that isn't necessary as the story emphasises on the present day actions. You know enough for the story to move along. The acting is fine and does not need to be analysed too much as this is an action film with plenty of dazzling special effects to deter your attention. The special effects are above par and don't seem too dated even by today's standard. Even for an action film it still does have a really strong theme (heaven & hell) good vs. evil. It doesn't explore it too much but it is the main story for this film, could have been done better though.I would recommend this film to anyone who found 'Van Helsing' entertaining.

Perhaps it was the ridiculous script. I'm not sure. All I know is that Spawn had a good premise and a great atmosphere for its story. I like when comics are made into film respectively. I don't read comics, and never really did as a kid, but I must say I've seen the front cover of Spawn on a magazine rack once. By the way it is drawn, it seems very dark, moody, and satirical. I guess that's a lot to tell from the front cover of something, but it just seems that way. Anyway, the film really captured that essence. Only it failed at two key ingredients a script, and leading actor.Martin Sheen struggles to make an impression, but is left out of the viewer's mind after seeing the lead actor (I can barely recall his name) and the miserable performance he gives. And the dialogue and plot is awful...Spawn is definitely one to see just because of its brilliant atmospheric touch, but don't expect too much in the way of witty dialogue or acting.2.5/5 stars --John Ulmer  "},{"Title":"You should well find this movie boring.","Date":"25 August 2002","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Horror","Review":"  When I rented this movie I hadn't really checked out any of its comments, for I enjoyed the comic Spawn so much, with all the amazing characters and lines, I really thought it would work out fine, but no, it sucked.The plot is horrible. The movie spends way too much time explaining the relationship between one another and has totally forgotten to let the character Spawn, or any other character, to grow. In fact, I found Spawn pretty dead. There's just no glamour in Spawn. (or actually, all of the characters)And the lines! Gosh, they are so dumb. Lines in the comic are compelling and powerful, yet there is none in the movie! They are so dumb that you think you are watching some stupid animation for pre-teens (deleting all the swear words).The movie too doesn't have a pace. The action sequences are slow, and not even artistic in the own Spawn way.It's just, if you like the comic, you are not going to like the movie. Even if you are looking for an action movie or just any movie with a comic source, I suggest you to check back the Batman series. So don't expect anything, except the cloak. That is the one thing that I like about the movie. And nothing else.

Ambitious or not, Spawn's translation is an inconsistent yet eclectic mix of action, espionage, black humour, and supernatural legend immersed in a heavy environment of digital and make-up effects, punchily edited with an MTV soundtrack, but even with an R rating Spawn's story begins to convulse and collapse under it's own zest to cram just about everything in but the Devil's kitchen sink. Unfortunately it's all stuff we've seen before; a broken hero seeking revenge, the family he's lost, the cold business like villain and even the mandatory street kid sidekick. So by the time Spawn's origin is established and the bullets and chains start to fly, interest begins to wane. Admittedly hi-octane, larger than life action fans may find something of interest here as Spawn doesn't stay still for long, with action scenes sharing the same absurd energy that many Manga titles depend on.	It is difficult to work out where Spawn fails most, as the film has both weaknesses and strengths in the same areas. While the cast has some respectable names their delivery is often marred by tacky dialogue, with Michael Jai White handed undoubtedly the worst. Martin Sheen sails through without too much effort despite using an awfully cliched tough guy voice that seems just a little over done even here. The almost unrecognizable John Leguizamo playing the spitting clown, adds some humour with some catchy but yet again over used one-liners. Nic  Williamson is a talented actor and wise choice of narrator but doesn't seem to fit comfortably within the scenes, his character is far too reminiscent of an Obi-Wan Kenobi figure.	Industrial Light and Magic's effects are also of hugely varifying quality, Spawn's transforming costume a high point, but too many low points are evident to mention, except for the truly appalling main demon. One can only guess the stretched budget was a key factor in this. Low budget aside, Spawn's script and ultimate direction seems to be it's biggest stumbling block, there are some bare bones of excitement contained but it's handled messily as the effects, sharing a similar fate as so many other comic book adaptations before, simply unable to convey itself effectively on camera to a wider audience.

"},{"Title":"Good dark story with potential - spoilt by bad acting and poor effects","Date":"11 January 2002","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Horror","Review":"  When Government assassin Simmons is left for dead by his treacherous boss Wynn his soul is carried to Hell where he strikes a deal with the devil whereby he will be able to see his beloved Wanda again in exchange for leading the devil's army of souls against heaven.  When Simmons (now Spawn) arrives back on Earth he finds himself with a new suit of armour attached to his own nervous system and two guides competing for his loyalty - clown and Cogliostro.  Wynn has developed a biological weapon and the Clown is setting him up to use it, however Spawn realises the enormity of what he is involved in and begins to use his powers to defend the earth.This is a comic book adaptation that didn't make it quite as big as some others have.  The story is good for comic standards and is quite dark in tone.  It is a little confused at times and it's not totally clear what's going on at times in terms of Spawn's loyalty and it's not totally clear why the clown is setting up Spawn to kill Wynn rather than just doing it himself?  However it's good to see a comic adoption that maintains a comic's dark tone (Batman & Robin anyone?).  Unfortunately the special effects are not up to the job of meeting the comic's vision - the scenes in hell are a joke and some of Spawn's cape effects are ropey - some of the effects are good (such as the Clown's transformation) but most are poor.The performances are pretty poor as well.  White is good when doing tough guy stuff and talking in a deep voice, but he cannot deal with Spawn - potentially a complex character instead he just does a lot of shouting and kicking.  Sheen doesn't manage to bring any quality to the film - he too just does a cartoon super-villain.  Theresa Randle doesn't have much to do as Wanda but boy does she look good doing it!  She is a good actress who has had better roles than this but she is good-looking in everything she does!  The prize for the worst actor goes to an uncontested Leguizamo - his clown is the worst thing about this film and his messing around distracts from the film where I suspect it was meant to be comic relief.  I was really tempted to push fast forward every time he came onscreen (but that was most of the film).Overall a dark story is given a potentially good plot but weighed down by bad acting and poor special effects.

Michael Jai White,(Al Simmons/Spawn) played the role as a good guy with a nice family and a cute little dog. Al worked for Martin Sheen,(Jason Wynn) and did not like the way Jason made his living or the tasks that he was assigned. Al wanted out of this operation and was asked if he would do one last assignment. This assignment was to lead the Devil's soldiers on earth which Al was tricked into and deceived by John Luguyano,(Clown/Violator) who was full of jokes and in many ways stole the entire picture from even the Devil himself. Great entertainment and outstanding acting by all the actors.

RIGHT. It's definitely not a date flick, not a chick flick, and too much horror/cruelty/scenes of Hellfire for a small child. First off- - the Clown. When I saw him, I thought, OK, this will be like Stephen King. Wrong. Stephen King sets out to scare you, not gross you out. This Clown was like the neighborhood pervert, spewing grossness in nearly every scene. At first I was curious about him, then every time he showed up in a scene I began to cringe. This character ruined the movie for me. The scenes of horror- well, they creeped me out. The one shining point was Martin Sheen. His role was top notch and polished.

Done by ILM if I'm not wrong. The weapons coming out from his armor or body were super cool, especially his chains and his ability to morph.The only special effect that didn't come through as realistic was the part where Spawn's cloak was flowing around the actors when he jumped down through the skylight and landed in the ballroom. Other than that, this was a great movie (despite the weak plot) with special efforts. It'd be great if someone could do a sequel with today's CGI.

In the end, I found it was a pretty good movie, but not nearly as good as it could have been.  Martin Sheen should not have been in this one, and I think he was horribly miscast.  The special effects were good in some scenes and over the top in others...the finale in Hell is a bit much and it is almost painful to watch, as there is just too much cgi.  This is the story of a mercenary who is killed and comes back as an agent for Hell.  This clown guides him, but the clown in the animated series was creepy while this one is to comedy oriented.  All in all it has some good action here and there and some good scenes it just needed to be made into a more adult oriented movie like Blade.

Early we hear a TV newscast, .....and the (Christian) Coalition attempting to bomb the Mid-east peace talks.... I know the Left hates anything Christian but this is goes even past the normal cheap shots filmmakers insert into many movies, especially when they deal with theology. You can count on everything but the real thing. The fact that Marilyn Manson is on the soundtrack should give you another clue where this is coming from, propaganda-wise.The fun part of the film was watching John Leguizimo playing a totally fat, gross person. He had some very clever and hilarious lines but stepped over the boundary of crudeness, too. He has to be one of the wildest characters ever put on screen.Overall, too much noise, out-of-control scenes and characters and too much of a Satanic feel to it to watch again. "}]
