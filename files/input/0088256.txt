[{"Title":"Magnificent neo-Hitchcock","Date":"6 March 2001","Score":"20 out of 20 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Thriller, Crime","Review":"  This movie was bitterly panned upon its release, and I see a number of IMDB's reviewers agree with the original critics.  I don't get it, except that this movie does such a good idea of taking you inside Stephen Bauer's character and what he is doing is so creepy that people react viscerally to him instead of the movie.  The movie is engrossing, brilliantly photographed and well-paced.  The camera angles and the chemistry between Bauer and Williams are reminiscent of what Hitchcock tried to do in Vertigo, but much less forced and contrived.  All these characters behave in character.  I really consider this one of the best romantic thrillers of all time.  Yes, it is erotic.  Why is that a bad thing?  10/10.

The erotic thrillerplot, the outragously great design and cinematography. Remember Flashdance or Cat People? Well, you got the idea! Well acted, actress Barbara Williams shines as seducted interior decorator , engaging love story with a great soundtrack and some very steamy sex scenes, it looked to me as if one of the scenes was actually hardcore! Must have been an unrated version! The story revolves around a pro burglar stealing the steamy diary of a bored nice sububan wife and then seduce her.

After stealing her portrait and personal memoires, he proceeds to learn more and more about the victim until he decides to come into personal contact. Passing himself off as a Company Director, he slowly seduces the victim and this is facilitated by her failing marriage. Inevitably, events catch up with the thief as his partner in crime goes to desperate measures to eliminate this side-distraction. I enjoyed this movie for a number of reasons but most of all, I thought it had a fantastic eighties soundtrack throughout. The story itself is not wonderfully exciting, but the fantasy of a burglar falling for one of his victims and using his psychological advantage to seduce her is quite interesting. A sense of compassion is felt for the central character as he strives to live a fantasy of his own making that slowly starts to disintegrate due to his own dark life. John Caruso puts in a disturbing and powerful performance as the drugged-crazed partner who takes matters into his own hands.

In my heart, Douglas Day Stewart is a genius. That he is capable of such sensitivity, instinct and passion just gives me chills, as said emotions are so pitifully rare in mainstream filmmaking (let's not even discuss the hollow garbage that has risen to the surface in the past decade). The infatuation, the sickness that plagues Scott Muller in this film is so clearly, so intensely conveyed through Stewart's meticulous direction (it's his frickin' script) and the thoroughly phenomenal performance of Steven Bauer. I'll grant certain persons there being plenty of flash, (otherwise known as brilliant photography and an energetic soundtrack) but...welcome to the 80's. That flash epitomized the decade and I've seen no slicker example, no smarter implementation of it than in this little picture here. The film is tremendous, ridiculously moving, simply magical. Invariably, the final scene leaves me in tears--of frustration for the characters, of enchantment for the beauty that is Thief of Hearts. I love that it is Bruckheimer/Simpson's lowest grossing film. It only stands to prove what idiots make up the bulk of American audiences.

As a Catholic school girl, I was obsessed with all things sexual, so I was an instant fan of the movie. I saw it several more times while it was still a popular cable choice, then lost track of it. However, I never forgot it the sexual tension, the premise...not even the title! As an adult, I talked my fianc√© into renting it, issuing the standard disclaimer I loved this in high school, but I was into Wham!, Duran Duran and Prince, too, so proceed with caution, etc. To my surprise, it was almost as good as I remembered it having been, and the sexual situations weren't nearly as contrived as I feared they might be. Some of the acting was a little wooden, but the premise is brilliant...I'm still trying to turn that around in my head...and, for some reason, I still don't keep a diary!

Being a private person (you don't see my NAME on this, do you?), I found the idea that anyone could so completely invade a life absolutely terrifying. In spite of a few holes, the film works, chiefly because the characters enmesh the audience in their feelings. Steven Bauer is incredibly underrated as an actor and, while I have seen stronger performances from him, he's very good as the enamoured thief in search of a way out and Barbara Williams is credible as the neglected wife enchanted by the mystery man. Let's not leave out John Getz, another unexplainably underrated performer, as the self-absorbed husband. If you can ignore the flashy 80s style, the film is a fascinating study of obsession. Warning it definitely deserves its R rating for unnecessary full nudity.

John Getz (Ray Davis),  A Day without a Mexican plays the role as a husband who writes children's books and has reached the top of his field. Ray is married to Barbara Williams,(Mickey Davis),Forever Evil who is getting rather unsatisfied with her marriage as her husband is always at his typewriter and never in bed where she wants him. Steven Bauer,(Scott Muller) The Lost City, actually runs into Mickey Davis and things progress to the boiling point between the both of them. David Caruso,(Buddy Calamara),Blue City, plays the role of a slime ball, who is a very evil character and looks quite young in 1984. Great tale with plenty of twists and turns and I simply Love The Ending.

Barbara Williams stole it with her beauty, innocence and naivety. For me the passionate love scenes backed up with the Harold Faltermeyer soundtrack was top drawer. I waited 5 weeks for the soundtrack (Germany) and it was well worth the wait. I still play it today.For all these reasons I still tell people this is my favourite film so far.

Great producers, great musicians doing the score, and just made in the part of the eighties where everything was cool, and everybody lived in excess.So its unfortunate that this film for me sunk like a led balloon. Yes Bauer has the charisma and the looks, but he is awful as the lead, and his delivery of lines and the way he changes just ruins the whole movie.Is this really the guy I saw in Scarface? He was amazing in that movie.Plus the fact that the husband does the worst thing imaginable and tries to make a living rather than letting his wife seduce him. What's a girl to do? Caruso pops up every now and again, with lots of attitude and the soundtrack crashes in and out one several occasions, which is funny for all the wrong reasons.It's a cheesiest in a bad way, and thank goodness that the producers had Top Gun around the corner.This had all the makings of a cool little thriller, it just gets more mundane as the film progresses and Bauer is nothing but a miserable child in this movie.

Bauer this time, makes the mistake of falling in love, on the account of a diary he steals, among many other possessions of this rich couple. When reading it, he becomes aware of the woman's pent up fantasies if she were another character, loose and daring. Trapped in a marriage, with a successful yet egotistical writer of children's books, we can tell deep down, she yearns for more. Obviously this marriage isn't perfect, where entire fault lies on the husband's ignorance, that finally drives this woman to accept the sexual advances of Bauer, posing as an interested client of her decorating business, where soon he's making his fantasies a reality, without laying it on too thick of course, so she doesn't put two and two.... This of course brings jealously from husband (the versatile Getz) where eventually things go out of control, which has Bauer slugging him. And honestly Getz deserves it. Even Getz's friend (George Wendt) explains his problem of narcissism, to which really his point falls on death ears. Actor Bauer is something of a surprise. He brings a magnetism and mystic character to this sexy stranger who sends the love boat of this married couple rocking. With it's highly original premise which set a lot of other films apart, Thief Of Hearts can't overcome a slight if enigmatic dullness about it. Not exactly a money spinner, there are some sexy moments and some cool scenes, like the slick robbery pulled off at the Davis house, in it's opening. Speaking of openings, it's opening song I loved, more than it's title song, the opening night shot of the Golden Gate bridge in what looks like heavy fog breaking, I must say is one of the best bits. We also see younger hottie Windsor, a street hustler, earning some bucks, candidly f..king Bauer, who declines, his mind preoccupied with another woman. A few scenes later, he passes again on another offer, this time two college girls, making some extra lucre. We also see a beaver shot of Windsor, slipping into a pair of jeans, before she's over compensated for her troubles. What happened to her after Howling 4? This dull, yet intriguing movie, that entices you with it's story, is also slightly 9 and a half week'ish, it's ending I thought was cool when first seeing the movie at fifteen. Although I mentioned a dullness about it, it's just the way I saw it, in no way, it's story rushed. Not to say, this doesn't without recommendation, though for some impatient viewers, it might have them a little vexed in the two's slow building relationship of this movie, some scenes almost ceasing to exist.

People say David Caruso is the only good thing in this film, but I didn't think he was very good. A bit too extreme for my taste. Shooting a cop and then losing his mind didn't do anything for me. I thought the husband and his business friend were great. The music is quite good also, and a lot of the warehouse scenes are quite well done, with lots of tension.

It will be interesting to see how much Spielberg draws from that movie in his movie Munich. Sword puts its revenge rs through emotional wringers, and several are themselves executed by the terrorists.In Thief,Getz was interesting in the cuckold role, and Caruso played himself.
