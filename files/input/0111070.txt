Nope. It's an original '90s style Christmas story that tugs at your heart strings, and reminds you that we were all kids once. It reminds you of those days when you dreamt of Santa... when you stood in line waiting to sit on the jolly elf's lap... your knees shaking... as you tried to memorize what you were going to ask Santa. Anyone who isn't touched by this movie should look for the little boy or girl inside, and remember the Christmas Eves when you listened for the clatter of reindeer hooves on the roof. If you have no such memories, you may not understand this movie. Thumbs up to Tim Allen and Judge Reinhold! Thanks for the happy tears! "},{"Title":"Tim Allen As...Huh?","Date":"26 November 2001","Score":"24 out of 28 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":"  	Ever wonder, who is Santa Claus, really?  Where does he come from, how old is he?  How in the world does he squeeze down a chimney, and how does he get in if there isn't a chimney?  What's the deal here?  Well, happily, the answers to these questions and more are finally answered, as the legend of Santa Claus comes to life as never before in `The Santa Clause,' directed by John Pasquin and starring Tim Allen.  Scott Calvin (Allen) is an executive with a toy manufacturing company, he's divorced and has a young son, Charlie (Eric Lloyd), who still believes in Santa, but is at an age at which doubt is beginning to creep into the picture.  And the fact that Charlie's mom, Laura (Wendy Crewson) has a boyfriend, Dr. Neal Miller (Judge Reinhold), who is a psychiatrist, isn't helping the situation any.  Neal, it seems, is adamant about counseling Charlie in the realities of life, which of course includes the real scoop on Santa, which doesn't go over too well with Scott.  	Then on Christmas Eve, which Charlie is spending with Scott, a strange thing happens.  There's a clatter on the roof, and Scott rushes outside to investigate, where he discovers a man in a red suit clamoring about on the roof of his two-story house.  As Scott watches, the man loses his footing and falls into the snow on the front lawn.  And to Scott's amazement, it's Santa Claus!  Or at least a guy dressed up like Santa, and he's not in very good shape at the moment.  Lying there on his back, the man hands Scott a card with instructions written on it about what to do in this particular situation.  `Put on the suit,' it says, `The reindeer will know what to do.'  And when Scott looks back up at the roof, what he sees concludes what Neal would probably call an SEE (Significant Emotional Experience), and though he doesn't realize it at the moment, his life is about to change forever...	And with that, Pasquin goes on to tell the story of Scott Calvin's amazing odyssey, which puts a humorous, and at times poignant, spin on this contemporary and highly imaginative rendition of the Santa Claus story, which offers much more than merely a fresh face on an old tale.  The Santa angle has that universal appeal that will attract viewers initially, but what makes this story really accessible is the reality which lies beneath the fantasy.  The relationships examined in this film-- the whole situation with Scott, Charlie, Laura and Neal-- are quite common in our modern world, and that obstacle in the lives of these characters puts a necessary balance in the story that makes it more than just another Christmas fantasy.  It puts an edge on the sentimentality that would've been over-the-top had Scott, for example, been a happily married man with a text book family life.  That would've been good for maybe a one hour T.V. special on a Tuesday night, whereas this story and the way it's presented is unique and lends itself well to full length motion picture status.	When you think of Tim Allen, you don't necessarily think in terms of Santa Claus-- his Tim Taylor, `Home Improvement' persona is simply too far-reaching (there are, in fact, some `in' jokes sprinkled subtly throughout this film, like when Scott, in Santa's workshop, picks up a toy tool belt and holds it up to himself)-- but it actually becomes a positive here, and another part of the appeal of this film.  it establishes Scott as a real person, an average guy attempting to cope with the everyday problems of everyday life.  And it keeps the core of the story grounded, which ultimately makes the fantasy work while giving it heart.  So, in retrospect, Allen was a perfect choice for the role of Scott Calvin, and in the long run this just may turn out to be one of his most memorable roles (which is somewhat ironic, as this was Allen's big screen debut), because this is certainly the kind of film that is bound to make a lot of people's annual `holiday movies to watch' list, falling into that category of films you can watch over and over again every Christmas season, like `A Christmas Story.' `Christmas Vacation,' `A Christmas Carol' and `It's A Wonderful Life.'  All films which, though certainly diverse, have at their center the spirit of Christmas along with family values and traditions, and all told in a way that enables the viewer to readily identify with the characters and the story, which is exactly what this film does.	Eric Lloyd turns in a good performance as Charlie, making his character believable while keeping him positive despite the conflicts which surround him, and Crewson and Reinhold are solid in their respective roles, as well.  But in supporting roles, the standout performances come from David Krumholtz, as Bernard, Santa's Head Elf, and Paige Tamada, who is endearing as Judy, the Little Elf.  	Rounding out the supporting cast are Peter Boyle (Mr. Whittle), Mary Gross (Miss Daniels), Larry Brandenburg (Detective Nunzio), Judith Scott (Susan), Jayne Eastwood (Judy, the Waitress) and Joyce Guy (Principal Compton).  An entertaining and ultimately uplifting movie, `The Santa Clause' is funny and enjoyable and has a lot to offer in the way of family entertainment, the kind of film adults and kids alike are going to appreciate.  And it may even make you believe in some things you hadn't even considered before-- but that's for you to figure out as you watch the movie.  And that's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 8/10.

Scott Calvin (Tim Allen) is a perfectly ordinary man who sells toys, dines at regular restaurants, and is incredulous about the spirit of Christmas. That is, until one magical Christmas Eve, the real Santa plummets from his roof and he is coerced into fulfilling the responsibilities as Santa Claus, an offer he simply cannot refuse. So ensues a calamitous, misadventurous night for Scott Calvin and his innocuous son Charlie, of delivering presents all around the world with exhaustion, only to conclude the evening at the North Pole, full of curious and inquisitive little elves who serve Scott and Charlie chocolate milk, dress them in royal pajamas, and stress that if Scott does not assume the role of Santa, then children throughout the world will be devastated. It can't be easy being the man in the red suit, especially when your personality doesn't satisfy the duties required. From Christmas Eve on, Scott Calvin experiences a marvelous transformation- from his appearance and appetite, to his tendencies and even language, to become a suitable Santa Claus by the following Thanksgiving, while being scoffed and threatened by the outside party (e.g. his former wife's fiancée, a psychiatrist frequently offers him therapy). For the most part, The Santa Clause is an endearing, delightful, and fruitful family comedy. There are some significant flaws, however, such as the tone frequently going from jolly and refreshing, to depressing and melancholy, from the realms of the North Pole, to the doldrums of the adulterated society. This kind of deviation is perhaps too serious and even discouraging for an innocuous Christmas comedy- and why would everyone who disbelieved in Santa Claus be so inclined to destroy Scott Calvin, for his harmless spirit and whim? Fortunately, by the end, it seems everyone has developed a newfound spirit towards Christmas and Santa Claus, through the convenience of witnessing Santa riding to the North Pole- and all is ended well A merry Christmas to all, and to all a great night! This is a mostly enjoyable Christmas comedy that is heartwarming, funny, and endearing, and definitely worth catching around the holidays. Some inspiring words from an elf Just because you don't believe in something, doesn't mean it isn't real.

Allen, then a popular TV fixture on the hit sitcom Home Improvement, easily carried his Everyman appeal onto the big screen with this sugar-coated perennial.

It's also a very original and engaging story; a divorced dad must take over the job of Santa after the real Santa falls off his roof, but first his son has to help him warm up to the idea. That being said, I admit that it's not a perfect film (ex Tim Allen's son is kind of bratty), but for a movie like this I'm willing to settle for less than perfect. Few family films are this funny for kids and adults alike. Tim Allen makes more hilarious wisecracks here than in any other film I have seen him in. Seeing him go from a sarcastic divorced father to a loving Santa Claus is a very touching story, and the concept of a Santa Clause (a contract to become Santa) is completely original.

Allen always has an affable, breezy carelessness to him, like he was some suburban dad on the way to pick up his kids from hockey practice one day and happened to wander onto a movie set. The filmmakers saw his bewilderment, mistook him for an actor, and he's been putting out charming, occasionally decent fare ever since. In The Santa Clause, he really does play a suburban dad, the typically divorced kind. Scott Calvin is his name (get it?;) and his life is a bit of a mess following his split up with wife Wendy Crewson. She's together with a hotshot doctor now, making him bristly. I would get a bit up in arms if my wife took up with Judge friggin Reinhold too. So he spends Christmas with his son (Eric Lloyd) accidentally burning their turkey and ending up at Denny's for their Christmas feat, with all the other recently divorced dads. Things are mopey until an outright misunderstanding causes Scott to cause the death of Santa Claus (!) and spur on his recruit,net for the job. Most of the fun of the film is Allen's good natured disbelief upon reaching the North Pole and seeing inch of real love elves. Pretty soon his waistline balloons, snowy facial hair sprouts and it becomes clear that he really is destined to be the big guy. It's a slight, lighthearted flick that's perfect for kids, with really funny work from elves played by David Krumholtz and Paige Tanada, and a small, sly appearance from Peter Boyle. Allen steals the show, though, and is wonderful. As far as the sequels go, the second is pleasant overkill, anime yet to see the third with Martin Short as Jack 'Sonic The Hedgehog' Frost.

Tim Allen is the leading actor and gets better as the role becomes more ridiculous or sympathetic, depending on your perspective. The movie takes an old theme of belief in Santa Claus and gives it a 1990's setting with parents who share custody of a lovable child, played by Eric Lloyd, who is starting to question if there is a real Santa. It is an issue that most families face or postpone but try to muddle through as best they can. The fantasy of Santa becomes a reality for the boy and his divorced father on a momentous Christmas Eve. Eventually both the boy and his father embrace the reality of Santa who takes possession of their lives. This leads to a collision with the real world of adults, teachers and the working environment. The mother is played by Wendy Crewson and the step-father by Judge Reinhold, in a fine performance as a serious psychiatrist badly shaken by the behaviour of the child and his father. David Krumholtz, 16 years old at the time, shines as the head elf. The movie is for adults or youth.

The Santa Clause starring Tim Allen is a movie that starts off with a feeling that it hasn't got it right, it's going to be another movie that tries to be fun and sweet but all together falls off the rails. This movie however feels alright, it's funny at times and does have a sweet centre in fact even sometimes you feel for the characters which quite often in these type of movies they start to falter the more you see of them. The story see's Tim Allen's character Scott basically become Santa as he well knocks him off his roof and then puts on the suit meaning in the Santa Clause he is now the jolly red suited man. We then see Scott really become Santa, only his son knows he is Santa, everyone else thinks he is crazy, things transpire and the whole story comes to an exciting end.It's well done this movie I mean even from a technical point of view and even though maybe watching some years after it can look outdated, it nevertheless still looks pretty cool. One of the things I felt this movie nails is the whole look of this, it's bright and full of colour and the North Pole when it is seen is fantastically built and the extras make for a great effort to create a nice atmosphere. The movie can suffer in parts through one too many fart jokes and not all the jokes hit the mark, but the movie still suffices in the way it is mostly funny. Tim Allen does well in his role, at first comes across as unlikeable but as the plot grows he matures as a character brining with him fun and that jolly feeling you need from the lead of a Christmas movie. After directing this, John Pasquin continued to work with Tim Allen and you can see why, he gets the most out of Allen and really the cast too, it can at times feel like some kind of made for TV movie and the directing isn't brilliant, but Pasquin makes the most out of the script and the film all in all satisfies. The writers create a script that works very well for a family feel of a movie and they create a story that is a nice one to direct and act in, it feels as mentioned before very sweet and although never truly strikes the heart immensely, still leaves you feeling a little for the characters involved.It's schmaltzy in moments but ultimately rewarding for anyone who has a heart, don't expect too much from this and you could be pleasantly surprised by this. The movie spawned two sequels by the time of review in which really although it deserved a second film, it does work extremely well as a single piece and one that is nicely enjoyable for all. It's also very much a plot that doesn't feel that different to those you may see in other Christmas movies however really the whole reason this movie for me is OK and a reasonable watch is that it manages to make you laugh but also touches the part of you that secretly is still a kid.

What?! You're giving The Santa Clause a bad review? How could you?! My question to you is, have you actually seen this movie, and thought about what it really is? Because if you did, you'd agree with me that this is a shallow, not particularly imaginative Christmas film with some bad child actors and the only reason people have some affection for it is because Tim Allen makes for a pretty good Santa Claus. The premise of the film is that Scott Calvin (Tim Allen) is a divorced father who is taking care of his son Charlie (Eric Lloyd) on Christmas Eve. When they hear a noise on the roof of their house, they discover that Santa Claus is real... but he has disappeared, leaving only his clothes behind. Charlie convinces his father to put on the red suit, hop in the flying sleigh and finish delivering the presents, not knowing that this means that by doing this, his father has agreed to become the new Santa Claus.My biggest problem with this movie is that the story's message is a really shallow one. If you look at the character of Charlie at the beginning of the movie, he doesn't like his father, doesn't want to be anywhere near him and is overall being a pain in the neck. Numerous times, he reiterates that he wants to spend as little time with his dad as possible during the holidays. When his father starts turning into Santa Claus though, all of a sudden these feelings change. This kid only begins loving his father because he is magically turned into a man that gives toys away for free. Let's look at some of the lessons or messages that we get from some of the classic holiday stories. Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas teaches even cynics that Christmas is not about presents, food or decorations, but about being together with the people you love and making the best of the holiday season. A Christmas Carol proclaims that the true spirit of Christmas is having good will towards your fellow man and extending a helpful hand out of generosity, and then goes on further to show that this spirit of Christmas should not be limited to only the 25th of December, but to every day of the year. It's a Wonderful Life shows that kindness and generosity are their own reward and that even when things seem to be dire and inescapably bad, the people that love you can gather and make it all OK; that one life, even if you don't think much of it, impacts countless others in a way that you can't fathom. What is the message of The Santa Clause? If your kid doesn't warm up to you during the holiday, magically transform yourself into Saint Nicholas, and he'll change his mind. Thanks for that! Maybe I'm looking too much into this movie. I bet you're just saying that this is a light family comedy, that's it. It doesn't mean to have any kind of message or deep meaning, it's just a Christmas-themed movie. I'll admit that it's not all bad. Tim Allen as Scott Calvin is actually really good. He has the best lines, throws himself fully in both the role of the frustrated father and Santa Claus and he not only looks the part, he feels right. Tim Allen, more than everything else in the movie combined made me laugh. I attribute the fact that people have affection for this movie solely on his performance and you can tell that he's having a good time. Considering he's the main character, that goes a long way.Even with Tim Allen doing what he does, this movie is still wrought with problems. This film feels like it was written not around a legitimate idea, but around the pun in the title. There are so many things that are unexplained or that flat-out make no sense. If Santa is running around giving people presents, why do the adults not connect two and two together when they see all of those gifts come Christmas morning? Why is it that only children believe in Saint Nick? Does no one spot him and his flying sleigh going around? Is there some kind of evil cabal that conspires against everyone in the world to oppress the belief of Santa Claus? Why is Santa kept a secret anyway? Maybe we'll get the answers in the sequels. Even if you dismiss these questions, there are some facts about this movie that are undeniable. First, the child actors are not very good. It's bad enough that Charlie, Scott's son is as wooden as a rocking horse, but every elf in this movie is played by a child (Well, one or two of them might be teenagers) and none of them are particularly convincing in their roles. I also really didn't care for the inconsistencies in the elf's magical powers and the numerous scenes where they feel the need to insert technology into Santa's Sleigh. He's been using magic for like a thousand years, and all of a sudden it's no longer good enough so they have to gives the elves jet packs (which leads to some big eye-rolls for me) and put all of these electronic gadgets in the sleigh. It just rubbed me the wrong way.I know a lot of people think of The Santa Clause as a holiday classic, but it's just alright. It's just one of the endless Christmas-themed family movies that are just churned out annually that hit that soft spot for a lot of people and families have associated it with quality and the holiday ever since. The message is shallow, the acting not particularly that good and the entire plot is based off a pun. Watch it for Tim Allen, but don't forsake one of the better Christmas films in order to watch The Santa Clause.

I don't how much I can say about this movie, but I will try on why I enjoy it. I thought that Tim Allen does an outstanding job as for both playing Scott Calvin, and for also playing Santa Claus. Moreover, I do thought Eric Lloyd does a fine job to play Charlie as well as the rest of the cast in this movie. The movie is very well written, which it does provides some really good laughs. The direction is very well directed, and I thought the sets that were design for the North Pole are really impressive. The special effects in this movie are okay, but I find some that are really dated such as some of the CG effects. The animatronics on the reindeers are really good, and I loved on how they were designed. This movie really does feature that good old Christmas spirit as you are watching it, and I too feel that spirit and it really is a great Christmas movie by Disney. I don't know if there are any more Christmas movies that are made by Disney aside from The Santa Clauses movies, but what do I know if there are any more Christmas movies. With that said, I also thought the movie works really good to not have a villain in it. Of course, the sequels do which I will get to but I never saw the third so I guess I won't be bother by talking about it. However, I will talk about the second movie which I thought was good too.

Yesterday was Halloween, but after Halloween I know Christmas is around the corner. I've always thought of November as the fastest passing month, but December is kind of long as you're waiting for Christmas and normally are busy with things like final exams. I'm also already seeing a couple of Christmas things out already in stores. To me, Thanksgiving isn't much of a holiday at least decoration wise. It doesn't seem important to decorate for Thanksgiving, only Halloween and Christmas. I saw how a friend set up a Christmas tree today so I thought now that Halloween is over I might as well get into the Christmas spirit. I saw this movie on an old VHS tape at my parents house. I'll tell you, watching movies on VHS takes you back to the time before DVDs and Blu Rays when you'd hear a number being dialed after pressing play, see old previews, see advertisements to Disney World, hear the words Coming Soon on Video Cassette, and hearing, And Now Our Feature Presentation. Since this was on VHS, it includes the 1-800 Spank Me Number, which we heard was deleted in later releases as the number was a sex hotline and there were expensive phone bills to people who called it out of curiosity. I haven't tried calling it, but I wonder if Disney bought that number, or if it's still a sex hotline? I think that's funny how a Disney movie would accidentally put a phone number in that ended up being an inappropriate number, lol. But, now to talk about the movie. We've been reading stories about Santa Claus for years, even singing songs about Santa Claus. We get an idea of who Santa Claus is in this movie. I mean, in this movie it seems like anybody can become Santa Claus if something happens to the current one, as that responsibility ends up falling under Tim Allen, Scott Calvin. None of the elves seemed to care about what happened to the last Santa Claus, or how there's a new one and just expect him to take the responsibility of being Santa Claus. Other things this movie shows us about Santa Claus. They do a good job of showing how he looks, but we don't often times think of Santa Claus as being fat as he's supposed to be in this movie. We also don't think too much about what Santa Claus eats other then other then milk and cookies, and sometimes holding a candy cane, and being in images with Coca Cola. This movie shows all the sweets Santa likes to eat. We also see how the elves are in this movie and reindeer, along with the North Pole. We see other things like to how Santa gets down the chimney and in houses without a chimney. We also see how the North Pole is and other things showing how Disney defines Santa Claus. It might be different than the way we read about Santa Claus in books or sing about him in songs. Well, here are some of the things about the movie. One, the North Pole might not look like we'd imagine the North Pole. It looked more like a really big toy room. If it were done nowadays, it would have been like all special effects for the North Pole. The elves also reminded me of the lost boys in the movie Hook even though they're not all males. I thought of how this movie is a little like Hook where Peter Banning played by Robin Williams becomes Peter Pan even when it's not his intention, as in this movie Scott Calvin played by Tim Allen becomes Santa Claus out of what he intended. Other things about this movie, well I'd say the first 1/3 of the movie is good, second 1/3 isn't too interesting but still watchable, and last 1/3 of the movie is good. There are still somethings that didn't seem too well thought out. Also, Tim Allen was great as Scott Calvin in this movie. This isn't the only Christmas movie he's been in. He was in Christmas With The Kranks a decade later. So, it's cool to see him as Santa Claus. This movie also gives you a feeling of Christmas, with the Christmas music and seeing fires in a fireplace around a Christmas tree. But, I felt like while watching this that the other human characters in this movie. While they're not unlikable characters, they just aren't interesting characters, making some scenes slow. I'd give this film a 7/10. Of all the Christmas movies it seems like the most popular ones are Home Alone. You can see this movie on TV during the holiday season, but it doesn't seem widely talked about. It did put me in a good mood and got me excited for Christmas.

But when Scott kills Santa accidentally everything is going to change for him.A lot of Christmas films have been made and a lot of times the role of Santa has been played but nobody ever captured that role as Time Allen did. He did very remarkable and very unforgettable job playing him. His acting is what makes this film partly so successful I think but also the scenes he has with his son on screen Eric Lloyd. The scenes between them father and Son are filmed really strong and is what makes the film good as well. For me Tim Allen will always be Santa it was a tradition for me at home to watch the Santa Claus films with the whole family on TV at Christmas every year. And I think it can truly be mentioned as one of the greatest Christmas films ever made.Of course with a Christmas movie you always wait for that special magical thing to happen. And the story really develops to that moment. When you, as an audience, see the home of Santa with the Elfs it gives you really as an adult a happy feeling.

I don't mean to imply its a perfect film because it is of course silly, implausible, full of product placement (good ol' Disney), but its also sweet and fun and magical. Watching our main character's transformation into Santa is easily one of the most memorable in Christmas film history. The movie really has everything you could possibly want from a Christmas film right from square one with familiar Christmas classics, a middle aged divorced father more concerned with his career than his family, Santa, presents, North Pole, elves, magic...you name it. It is all here. There is also a ton of hidden little Easter Eggs (pardon the pun) in the film from Mickey Mouse's hidden face in the moon to elves hiding amongst the humans throughout the movie. Its a fantasy adventure comedy that kids will absolutely adore and adults can still smile even if its a guilty little pleasure. Best of all the film is full of magic and morals and is squeaky clean save few a couple of stupid fart jokes in the beginning (I hate fart jokes but they are there for better or for worse.) Tim Allen blew everyone away with his comedy on Home Improvement in the 90's and with this film he proved his chemistry could translate to the big screen. Allen really is fantastic in this movie. He goes from the selfish single Dad to Santa in all the right ways and makes the unbelievable believable. Eric Lloyd does a great job as Allen's son. He isn't amazing but this is really one of his first films and he is absolutely right for the part. The chemistry between him and Allen is perfect and fits the film. Wendy Crewson is Allen's ex-wife and she is good in the role. She doesn't get a lot of time on screen and her best scenes are towards the end when she comes around to the idea of her ex-husband being Santa Claus. Judge Reinhold is really the closest thing you get to a villain in the movie and he isn't quite that. He's a grown up who refuses to accept a concept like Santa Claus. They do make him awfully unlikable though which is unfortunate. However, he serves a purpose and mostly is there for Allen to make sarcastic jokes about. His scenes near the end when he comes around to Santa are really silly and poorly done in my opinion. David Krumholtz is sorely underused as the head elf. He is a very funny actor and I think there could have been more done with him and the relationship between him and Allen.Director John Pasquin had worked with Allen on Home Improvement and a few projects since then including his new sitcom Last Man Standing. They likely know each other very well and know the style of comedy. I'm not sure he's the optimal choice for a family Christmas film but he absolutely gets it done in the right away. Perhaps my only but would be that there could have been more character development with the supporting cast and I felt like the ending is very rushed. They spend a lot of time building up this story and then it seems as though they realized they spent too much time and have to wrap it up very quickly. Nonetheless, this is a lot of fun and you will certainly enjoy watching it and you'll smile a lot. For me, it wasn't laugh out loud funny like I expected it to be but its simple and cute. There is a lot of magic for the little ones and you can't fault them at all for making something like that. Its worthy of adding to your family Christmas film rotation every year!

Like all the best Yuletide films, it requires the viewer to take a leap of faith and believe the unbelievable so that once you do that you're taken along for the ride and in this case, an entertaining and amusing ride it certainly is.Tim Allen stars as the divorced dad who feels diminished next to his ex-wife and her new man, who naturally is younger, better-looking and higher-earning, though with a taste for gaudily patterned pullovers. Even his relationship with his young son is beginning to pall, despite his best, if misguided efforts but when his rival, a myth-defying, dream-denying psychiatrist attempts to brainwash young Charlie that Santa doesn't exist, it's obvious that it's going to take something exceptional for him to turn the situation around. Cue a fateful encounter with an unexpected visitor on the roof on Christmas Eve and the fun really starts.While some of the special-effects are a little weak, in general this movie gently and neatly encapsulates the elusive Christmas spirit with a nicely judged mix of childish wonder and knowing humour for grown-ups,making it an easy film for parents and children to watch together. Neat touches abound, with pointy-eared elves turning up everywhere, running gags inserted into the narrative and some pleasing sight gags (I liked especially the cops map of the area surrounding Allen's house as they set up the Santa sting, a do-nut shop prominently highlighted for easy reference).Allen makes for a believable, under-achieving dad who eventually accepts his transformation and so wins back his son's affection. The child actor playing his son too I found refreshingly cute-free. Interestingly, the story has no real baddie to pitch them up against, unless you're going to vilify Judge Reinhold for denying Santa's existence.Watching this pleasant and amusing film certainly set our household up for this coming Christmas in what I certainly rate as one of the superior Christmas-themed films.

It is need for the plot of Scott Calvin (Tim Allen). Scott Calvin is spending some time with his son Charlie on Christmas Eve when he hears something on the roof. It turns out to be Santa Claus whom Allen's character accidentally kills by yelling at him. Santa Claus lost his footing and fell off the roof to his death. Surprising, the movie is very okay with showing death so heartily. There is something wrong with that. There was no mention of whom the guy was, or anything. He's dead, and that's all we needed to know. Scott Calvin finds himself responsible for resuming his duties. At the North Pole, the main elf Bernard tells Scott that according to the Santa Clause law, is now required by law to take on Santa's identity. After Charlie tells his mom and child-psychologist stepfather Neil (Judge Reinhold), they're convinced that Charlie has been warped by his dad. While the movie treat Neal who takes a doubtful position on Santa's reality not into a jerk like other holiday films nor does the ex-wife is a love interest. Months do pass and Scott transforms into Santa, until court hearings decide that he's nuts and cut off his visitation rights. Another December 24 approaches and Scott must convince his employers and ex that he's not crazy, and that he is Santa Claus. The premise for The Santa Clause, written by Leo Benvenuti and Steve Rudnick and directed by John Pasquin, is a clever one, and the movie is not without real charm. The Santa Clause launched Tim Allen in the movie business, spawned two sequels, and did so much for the holidays. It had great storyline with great characters. Aided by excellent special effects, he really does look like he's changing to St. Nick. The movie has the funny romp through the misadventures of an average man trying to cope with his unexpected transformation into Santa Claus. The jokes about him changing are just as funny for adults as for kids. The movie also has depth in the relationship of father and son who love each other during custody hearing. Still some people may be disappointed that this movie overlooks the religious significance of Christmas in favor of present-giving and childhood wish-fulfillment, but the movie ends on an appropriate note of good will and reconciliation. The child actor playing Charles (Eric Lloyd) is just annoying who whines his way unconvincingly throughout the film. Still Charles was able to explain some Santa Claus questions when judged by Neil. I like how the film tackles the Santa Claus questions to the myths by an intriguing theory, handled in a throwaway line of dialogue, to explain how Santa is able to do what he can do. One thing that needs to be mention is about the presents magically appears under the tree. It's one of the biggest plot holes; every parent turns a blind eye to the extra presents under the tree. In the film, Santa is real, but the adults don't believe he is real, how can they think he's not real exactly when toys just magically show up. Sadly this is my opinion, the first and only good Tim Allen movie role besides voicing Buzz Light year in Toy Story. He could have done better, as the sequels to this are not that great. It's a great watch, but probably only good watching it once in the holidays.

Why couldn't Santa just have retired instead of slipping on the icy roof and disappearing? (He waves goodbye, so I guess the old Santa didn't die, after all.) Well, it seems that this started out as a Hollywood Films Disney movie which was intended to be more like a Christmas Vacation-style film with more adult humor and still has a few inappropriate lines and comments, here and there. It became Disneyfied.Ultimately, this was a very good thing. (Originally, SC was to have shot Santa with a shotgun, as a rooftop burglar.) Little Charlie grew up and pretty-much disappeared after Santa Claus 3. (Not uncommon for many cute child actors.) Scott Calvin becomes the Santa replacement because of the Santa Clause He who causes the current Santa to be unable to perform his duties must take his place; and he faces numerous comic dilemmas Santa weight gain, bushy white facial hair, disbelief by all. The cleverly-written script carries the movie along and the airborne elves at the end are very ingenious. Santa Clause 2 (which Disney didn't run on cable this year) is a bit off. It's too weird. The plastic duplicate Santa has a nightmarish Frankenstein quality to it. SC courting Mrs. Claus is the only saving-grace of Santa 2. Seeing SC's kid turn into a juvenile delinquent is a real downer. Chet the Reindeer is hilarious and steals the show. So candy bars make him fat, but why the potty humor? The rip-off ending from Laurel & Hardys', March of the Wooden Soldiers shows a great lack of originality here. It's been done before-in the 1930's.Santa Clause 3 once again, steals the plot from another film. This time, it steals the Jack Frost villain from an old Rankin-Bass animated short. However, Martin Short is very good as Jack Frost. However, the out-takes over the ending credits spoil the magic of a Santa film. I really only like the first film. The original can be enjoyed and the sequels soon forgotten.Enough already, please no more Santa Clause movies.

I believe that this one was the most entertaining of the three.I think the key aspect to a movie is the beginning, and the beginning and middle were the most entertaining to me in this movie. The end was good, but to me, it started getting a bit silly. I won't spoil anything, but after the mid-section of the movie was done, it wasn't so whimsical and amusing anymore. In the beginning and middle of the movie, it's all about Tim Allen not believing that he is Santa Clause, and I find that quite humorous because that's what any person would probably do.However, overall this movie does deserve a 7/10 and I definitely recommend watching it for families, because this is a 100% family approved film!

Late night driving, disastrous meals, carols, early morning wake-ups, magic, cocoa and so on. It's a rather clever film, as a man must become Santa, little does he realize, this could save his relationship with his son. The great thing about this film is how it takes on the adult and child perspectives. We have a broken home dynamic, but one that is at the point of childish quips and name-calling. There are many times when Allen is more childish than Lloyd. Allen adds some biting wit, and there are plenty of jokes to keep adults happy. The saviour of his relationship with his son also becomes an even worse destroyer as his life begins to unravel. It is dark at times, but this just builds up to the heartwarming ending. It's very realistic in its approach. Nobody believes Allen, and he is labelled as mentally unfit. The film also avoids having a needless antagonist. We can perfectly understand everybody's point of view. One of my holiday favorites.

Little did the world know that Tim Allen, the Home Improvement guy would have a take at it. The catch is that Santa Claus is real, and is more like a position in the mob rather than the happy jolly man image. Tim Allen's character, named Scott Calvin &#150; Same initials as Santa, it must be destiny &#150; has a child named Charlie and is caught in a triangle of adults with his ex-wife and her new husband, played by the always amazing Judge Reinhold. Then on one particularly magical Christmas Eve, Santa came to the Scotts house and wound up dying of all things! Here's where the contract comes in (hence the name of the movie, The Santa Clause). Scott finds a business card in the fallen symbols coat pocket, which we later find out is a contract to becoming Santa Claus. Between kidnapping charges of young Charlie, and running form the cops, Santa along with an elite division of elf's called E.L.F.S manages to escape from jail with the use of tinsel, and to save Christmas&#133;like in every Christmas movie. As typical as it is though for Christmas to be saved, it is not done without laughs and adventure all wrapped up into one comedy that can be enjoyed by both the kids, and the adults.

His character Scott Calvin is a marketer for a major toy company. Currently divorced - his ex-wife Laura (Wendy Crewson) now married to a psychiatrist (Judge Reinhold) - Scott has one son, a fine young man named Charlie (Eric Lloyd). On Christmas Eve, when Santa Claus falls off Scott's roof, Scott puts on Santa's suit and, in effect, unwillingly accepts a contract to take over Santa's gift-delivering duties. Over time, Scott eventually realizes that he indeed was meant to become Santa Claus.My favorite moments from The Santa Clause include the following (DO NOT read any further if you have not yet seen this film). The previous Santa (before Scott takes over) is funny when he falls off the roof. During a children's soccer game, we hear a very laughable dixieland rendition of Jingle Bells. In order to impress upon Laura that he is stuck in traffic, Scott honks his horn and yells out to an imaginary driver. When Scott and Charlie first ride Santa's sleigh, Scott casually asks a neighboring truck driver if they are heading towards I-94. Scott loudly admits that he sleeps buck naked and then tries to stifle his embarrassment when a neighbor and her daughter walk by. The Jeopardy! theme is heard while Scott finishes his abundant desserts at a business lunch; afterwards, Scott is quite funny as he expresses his disdain for Santa Claus driving a tank. Two Punch & Judy puppets shriek at the sight of Scott's boxer shorts. On the manhunt for Scott/Santa, several police officers grab another Santa and slam his body against their vehicle. Scott quickly mumbles through the rest of The Night Before Christmas as Charlie falls asleep. And finally, in the most tearfully heartwarming moment in the entire piece, Scott tells Charlie how absolutely honored he is that Charlie not only believed in him but also helped MAKE him the new Santa Claus.I think children of all ages will enjoy The Santa Clause, particularly the magical land of Santa's busy elves at the North Pole. True, there may be some ludicrous moments in this film (e.g., elves looking like children, yet actually being over a millennium old; houses that alter themselves to accommodate a chimney & fireplace that enable Santa to drop down), but I can overlook those. The Santa Clause is a wonderful movie that I believe was well worth the time and effort, enabling us all to embrace the Christmas spirit.

Scott Calvin (Tim Allen) is a single parent with a son Charlie (Eric Lloyd).Scott is a toy salesman for a large toy manufacturer. When Charlie's mom Laura Miller (Wendy Crewson) and step dad Dr. Neal Miller (Judge Reinhold) drop Charlie off at Scott's home for Christmas Eve dinner, they tell Scott that Charlie does not believe in Santa Claus. All of Scott's attempts to provide a good dinner fail, and Scott and Charlie end up at Denny's for a Christmas Eve Dinner. Charlie is awakened by a noise on the roof, and when Scott and Charlie go outside to investigate, they find Santa on the roof. Santa slips off the roof and is killed from the fall. While looking for identification, Scott finds a business card on Santa. The card states that Scott must take over for Santa. The reindeer take Scott and Charlie on the appointed rounds, delivering toys to the girls and boys, before ending up at the North Pole. Bernard (David Kurmholtz), the head elf, explains to Scott that when he put on the Santa suit he became the new Santa Claus, because of the 'Santa Clause'. Over the next year, Scott loses his job as a toy salesman, gains weight, and grows facial hair that turns white.Director John Pasquin attempted to inject comedy into the sensitive subject of believing in Santa Claus. Trying to make a movie for all ages is especially hard when the subject is Santa Claus. I believe the use of the police in this movie was not the right approach for a children's movie, because children are instructed from early on in life that police officers are their friend and present to help them in a time of need, only to be further confused by the sight of their friend taking Santa Claus to jail on Christmas Eve. The animation of the reindeer was superb. The fact that Charlie's step dad, psychiatrist Dr. Miller, wanted a weenie whistle for Christmas was one of the funnier parts of the movie. My opinion is that this movie rates on the low end of the Disney collection. I do believe, do you?

Tim Allen has a criminal record and Disney has a no hiring of ex-cons policy. An exception was made in this case. Odd, really. They had first considered Bill Murray and Chevy Chase, but settled on Allen. I think this may have been good. While both Chase or Murray could possibly have been better, they also both have their own notable Christmas movies, so it was time to pick a new comedian.I am not big on Tim Allen, despite liking Home Improvement and enjoying his role here for the most part. I am, however, a fan of Judge Reinhold. This film is really great, though Reinhold gets the shaft. He is more or less a background character who wears ugly sweaters. (Why he has such a strong interest in the custody of a kid that is not his is open to speculation.) Allen shines, and as far as kids movies go, this is a pretty good one. Not sure how well it jibes with other Christmas or Santa myths, but I guess kids are not smart enough to really put that all together.There could also be some debate about whether or not Santa is killed. He falls off a roof, moves his hand a bit, and disappears. Now maybe this is because it would be too grim for a kids movie to have a corpse in a snow bank, but I suspect he did not actually die but simply faded away... it is left open to speculation.One nice thing about this film is how it has humor for a wide age range. While geared towards children for the most part, there is still a healthy dose of more adult humor. No outright sex or violence, but some not-too-veiled references to drug use and other things not necessarily appropriate. But this is why it worked to cast Allen, because having him be completely G-rated seems out of place.Definitely a much better Tim Allen Christmas film than Christmas With the Kranks.

Sadly, for the most part, I didn't even find that.Scott Calvin is a divorced father whose son, Charlie comes to stay with him on Christmas Eve one year. That night, Charlie hears noise coming from the roof of the house, and goes to wake his father up! Scott then goes out to investigate, and calls up to a man on the roof, who then falls off! Although Scott doesn't believe this is actually Santa Clause at first (he stopped believing in Santa long ago), he finds instructions to continue the job from there, and he and Charlie soon start flying around from house to house in the sleigh, as Scott delivers the presents! Once finished, the father and son are taken to the North Pole, where Scott is told that since he has put the suit on, he is now Santa! The next morning, it seems like it was all just a dream to Scott, but Charlie is convinced that his father really is Santa Clause! As the following year goes by, Scott finds himself gaining weight and growing facial hair at a rapid pace! He is now convinced it's all true, but obviously not too many others would believe it, so can he trust Charlie to keep it a secret? During my most recent viewing of The Santa Clause, at first, I had trouble getting into it, but around the part where Scott and Charlie are out investigating, it started to look more promising, even though the farting reindeer was uncalled for. However, starting with the North Pole, I found that it went back downhill. During the film, I laughed or smiled here and there, but not too many of the gags were memorable. Scott about to be sucked through a pipe in a house that has no chimney is a memorable and funny scene, but there are not too many others I can think of. I was also expecting to find the movie touching towards the end, but I found the moments (at least most of them) that were supposed to be like that pretty silly, with the fairly poor acting and script.I haven't seen every film starring Tim Allen, but looking through his credits, it appears that he hasn't had the greatest career in Hollywood history. While The Santa Clause has clearly been well received in comparison to some of his other films, better family Christmas flicks have been made. I'm sure there are films of this kind with equal entertainment value for kids and adults, but I can't say The Santa Clause is a very good example. It may not be strictly for kids (it would probably have a lower IMDb rating than 6.0/10 if it was), but more for kids than for adults, no doubt about that. Watching it shortly before Christmas, it didn't really put me in the spirit, which was not the case when I saw it years ago.

One was The Santa Clause.  Not a Tim Allen fan -- I always avoided his television series -- I was hesitant to view the film.  I know he'd ask about the film, so I watched it, and I really liked it.The character played by Allen finally accepted all the situations into which he was propelled.  Finally, a youngster who is not a brat -- that was a huge plus for my enjoyment.  I cannot take mouthy, whiny kids.  Charlie was a boy who was enchanted with the holidays as many of us were so many, many winters ago.  Neal and his traditionally goofy sweaters made for a recurring joke -- humorous with no double meanings.  ****SPOILERS**** Yes, the ending was predictable, but so are all holiday stories for families.  Some have inquired about the much-wanted Mystery Date game.  THE DUD was supposed to be the loser date  while the other dates were dressed in cool fashions, the Dud wore slacks and a shirt -- maybe a sweater -- he had short hair, and he was a decent looking boy.  My daughter and her friends saw nothing wrong with the Dud, except for his name.  Seeing a game like this again brought back a sweet memory.A few leftover questions  did Scott kill Santa?  why wasn't the mother concerned about the whereabouts of Charlie after Santa was apprehended by the police -- Neal reassured her by saying Charlie was okay -- he was on the roof at the time, and Laura was not even concerned enough to look for him -- how did those children with the elf ears reach the town?  and how about spending more money to make the reindeer look real?I recommend this easy-to-view film.

But at the time I gave it a pass; my children were teenagers and didn't have much interest in kids movies. Nor did I. But this holiday season I felt like feel-good movie. Something akin to A Christmas Story, one of my all-time favorites, but one I've seen too many times. I needed a new Christmas movie and The Santa Claus seemed like a promising candidate.  Wrong.Tim Allen plays Scott Calvin, a workaholic divorced parent who cannot connect with his young son. And he desperately wants to, both for his son and to offset the influence of Mom's new boyfriend. But Scott can't do anything right. Then on Christmas Eve Scott accidentally kills Santa Clause. Funny, huh? The clause in the title is not a misspelling, but refers to the legal clause that requires anyone who offs Santa to take his place. This is cleverly done, although it is a bit maudlin. Well guess what happens? Scott learns the (non-religious) meaning of Christmas, bonds with his son, discovers himself&#133;make that a lot maudlin. In 1994 Tim Allen was riding high with his hit TV show, Home Improvement, and in The Santa Clause he plays Tim Allen playing Tim Allen playing Santa Clause. No stretch here. And the rest of the cast is just there as a foil for Tim. And the plot, however clever, just wasn't very entertaining to this reviewer. Actually, this minority commentator didn't like The Santa Clause very much at all, and certainly can't recommend it to anyone.

Basically Scott Calvin (Tim Allen) has been divorced from ex-wife Laura (Wendy Crewson) for some time now, and though she is married to a slightly annoying Dr. Neil Miller (Beverly Hills Cop's Judge Reinhold), he still has access to his six year old son Charlie (Eric Lloyd). Still a big believer of Santa Claus, Scott doesn't want to upset Charlie, and on Christmas Eve there is an unexpected visitor, and shouting up to the man in the red suit, Scott unintentionally causes him to fall off. Charlie comes outside and sees that his Dad has seemingly killed Santa Claus, a supposed identity card confirms who he is, and there is a note saying that he should put on the coat and take over the sleigh and reindeer. So with Charlie urging him on, Scott does indeed put on the red coat and is taken from house to drop off the hundreds of presents to houses far and wide. Eventually the delivering is over and they are taken to the North Pole and the workshop of many elves, who admittedly look like children but are working very hard for next year. Lead elf Bernard (David Krumholtz) tells him that because he put on the red coat he is now taking over all responsibilities, this is the Santa Clause (a law contract or regulation, you would get one with a divorce), and he is now the new Santa Claus. So not long after returning home for the remaining year before December approaches, Charlie is still insisting to everyone that his father is Santa Claus, while Scott develops the big guy attributes, such as the white hair, a beard that won't go away and a big gut that won't be slimmed. Eventually he has truly become Santa Claus and there is nothing he can do about it, so he accepts his responsibility, and returns to the North Pole ready to steer the sleigh and reindeer. There is a point when Laura and Neil tried to stop Scott seeing Charlie, and the police get involved with finding Santa Clais, but in the end, everything settles. Also starring Larry Brandenburg as Det. Nunzio, Mary Gross as Miss Daniels, Paige Tamada as Judy the Elf, Peter Boyle as Mr. Whittle and Judith Scott as Susan Perry. I didn't realise this was the first feature film Allen starred in, a good debut as a Scrooge like working father with quite a few sarcastic comments, and it of course led him to become the voice of Toy Story's Buzz Lightyear. The story is filled with some clever Christmassy reference, many funny slapstick and sentimental moments you've come to expect from Disney, all in all, a fun for all the family seasonal fantasy comedy. Worth watching!

He has a certain style that makes him intensely likable, even when he plays smarmy jerks. And he's made some real gems throughout his career. Both Toy Story films are superb, as well as the excellent Star Trek spoof Galaxy Quest. So its a shame that his career has stalled recently. He's been forced into playing in some real stinkers like The Shaggy Dog, and having to recycle past glories like The Santa Clause 3. So I decided to write about the original 1994 box office smash hit.The original Santa Clause is really the only decent one. It's based upon a fundamentally clever idea. An idea that was tailor-made for Tim Allen, and flexible enough to be stretched to feature length. But I don't think it was ever intended to be a trilogy.The Santa Clause works well enough as a standalone film, but there isn't enough material for anything more. Its no surprise the sequels are running on empty, while the original is endlessly creative.Allen plays Scott Calvin (initials SC, fate perhaps?), a cynical toy executive who's a neglectful father. On Christmas Eve, his ex-wife Laura drops off their son Charlie. In the middle of the night, Scott hears someone on the roof. When he investigates, a man dressed as Father Christmas (I'm British and that's what we call him over here!) falls to the ground and dies. Yikes, they killed him!It turns out this fella was the genuine article. Complete with sleigh and reindeer. Scott fishes out a card from his red suit, advising him to put it on. When he does, Scott is whisked away to the North Pole, where he meets all the elves. Where he is informed that he is the new Father Christmas.When Scott put on the red suit, he fell victim to the Santa Clause. It means that he's contractually obligated to fill out the duties and responsibilities of being Father Christmas. At first Scott refuses to believe it, but over the following months a lot of weird things happen. He puts on weight. His hair turns white. He grows a beard no matter how often he shaves. And when he gets a list of all the naughty and nice boys and girls in the world, he realises there may be more to the Santa Clause than he thought.The Santa Clause is one of the few Disney films I have real affection for. Its derived from a wonderfully original idea, and matched with the perfect actor to carry it off. Tim Allen is totally sidesplitting throughout. Throwing out snide remarks at the kids he meets, this is a Christmas confection with a slightly sour centre. I mean, how daring can you get having an image of Father Christmas being killed. And in a Disney film no less!The film really picks up steam as Scott goes through the changes. All Tim Allen has to do is just stand there with his big belly, white hair and beard and you find yourself cracking up. The pace flags a little midway when Laura tries to take Charlie away from Scott, but it recovers momentum quickly when Scott, now fully happy in his role, has to be broken out of prison by ELFS, a sort of elf related flying squadron.Its also very helpful in explaining how Father Christmas manages to fit down a chimney. How he gets into homes with no chimneys. How he gets around the world all in one night. I won't reveal the answers. One of the film's pleasures is providing possible solutions to these eternal mysteries. Some of them are quite credible too. As well as humorous.It ends suitably on an uplifting note with Scott making his annual rounds, and taking his place as the new Father Christmas. Its a pity they didn't just leave it there. The sequels only served to add unnecessary complications to an already extremely entertaining story. But the original Santa Clause is the only one out of the trilogy that gets the balance just right. The balance between Scott's normal life and his new one. The sequels couldn't achieve the same focus, and ended up disappointing failures.By all means, catch the Santa Clause. Not literally of course!

If I recall, it did fairly well at the box office, and carved a new name for Tim Allen as a film star.Allen plays Scott Calvin, a busy father to Charlie, who has been having doubts as to the existence of a certain Mr. Claus, recently. On Christmas Eve, Charlie spends the night over at Dad's house, and during the night, they have an unexpected visitor Santa Claus. But after an unbelieving Scott scares Santa up on the roof, causing him to fall and die (or evaporate). So, Scott tries on Santa's suit for no apparent reason, and he and his son are whisked away to The North Pole, which consists of...well...a little pole sticking out of the ground with a built in security feature. After a little elf activates the pole, Charlie and Scott are sucked underground into Santa Claus' work shop, where they meet Italian Head Elf Bernard, as well as cheery, 800-year-old children called elves. Bernard explains to Scott that by putting on the suit, he has accepted the role of Santa Claus, and will be Santa Claus until he is Unable to do so, either by accident or design.So, that is what starts this cheery holiday fable. We see Scott coming to facts that he is Santa, including a beard sprouting out of his face every time he shaves, and a big, fat beer gut that comes out of nowhere. Not only that, but pretty soon ex-wife Wendy Crewson is beginning to become a little worried with Scott's far-from-normal appearances, so she and new-beau Judge Reinhold try to keep Charlie away from his father...even if it means filing for, 'No-visitation-rights, as Crewson says.The film is a nice family treat. It is not what I would call a Christmas Classic, but it is one that I usually see every year just because I own it. Tim Allen's performance itself is worth seeing the film for. It is one of his best, other than the Toy Story films. Perhaps the fact that he hasn't really been in many other films is why I say it is one of his best performances. Anyway, he does good. There is one particular moment that is very reminiscent of Allen's humor. Scott is at a meeting with boss Peter Boyle, and new toy designs are flying by. One includes Turbo Tank Santa, which shows a picture of Santa sitting in an army tank. Scott - because he is now Santa - is outraged, and goes on about how it is just wrong to show Santa in a tank. He then imitates a woman, and says, Well, Timmy, I hope you've been good this year, because Santa just took out the Ferguson's house! INCOMING! I love that part. It is, perhaps, the finest moment of the film...All in all, `The Santa ClausE' is not one of the smartest of hippest films I've seen before, but it's pretty funny.

It makes me wonder what the actor actually puts into the movie other than their appearance. I guess though it has to do with team work without the actors the movie will not work nor will the movie work without the director, producer, sound technicians. Why am I raving about this to this movie? Namely because this movie pushes the leading actor to promote the movie.The Santa Clause is about a man who scares Santa while he is on his roof. Santa falls off the roof, breaks his neck, and the man, Scott Calvin, must finish the job. Calvin doesn't really believe in Santa but he is pretending to to get at his son's step father, who he really doesn't like. Unfortunately for Scott, buy putting on the suit made him subject to the Santa Clause that basically turns him into Santa.This movie is about belief, pure and simple. About continuing a belief to bring joy and happiness to the kids across the world. It is about finding answers to stupid questions about continuing the beliefs, and to me it totally pagan. They are putting their faith in a fat guy that eats milk and cookies and has been corrupted down the ages to the current form.Christmas makes me sick because it is the time of peace to earth and goodwill to all people. Why should that make me sick? Namely because people only do it on this time. Pizza Hut is making pizzas for homeless kids on Christmas, that is nice, but it is only to promote them and during the rest of the year the street kids can simply go to hell. What is worse than false sentiment is sentiment used to promote oneself. Christmas brings a lot of expectation, too much unfortunately and in the end it results in a lot of pain. People not only die on Christmas but they kill themselves because the social expectations that they are looking for do not come to light.The Santa Clause continues this false sentiment because it focuses of a fictional character that does not offer any salvation. He is a character that appears only once a year to give presents to children. He is a focused person that offers no hope whatsoever, only empty joy. If you really want to find the spirit of Christmas look to that man who was born in a cave in the ancient middle east who grew up only to be nail to a cross and then returned to life.

I would have preferred less screen time with REAL reindeer instead of the cutesy, ridiculous-looking reindeer.Another downside was Wendy Crewson's character. What a plastic person. In all her lines, she whines and whines. I got so tired of it, I wanted someone/anyone to slap her across the face and tell her to shut up. The director should have realized that her character was so over the top that the scenes she was in were ruined just by her presence. I'd hate to have that whiny complainer as my mother. No wonder Charlie wanted to hang with Dad. However, Judge Reinhold was perfectly cast as the nasty, condescending psych doctor. I wish Scott Calvin would have punched him in the nose -- that would have made the movie more interesting.The theme that you cannot tell the truth or you will get in trouble just did not sit well with me in this movie. Charlie told the truth in every detail but his wacko mother and her oaf of a boyfriend used that against him. Some marvelous lessons could have been portrayed on the screen instead of Scott denying the whole thing in front of Charlie ad nauseum. That part of the script was very poorly thought-out.I loved 2 scenes in the park where the little girl approaches Scott and asks for a Christmas present. That is precious. Also, the little girl who woke up for Santa -- she was a doll. So, this movie is worth seeing, despite some major flaws.

I'm going to try to comment on all the classic Holiday films. This is one of them. Anyway, this is truly an excellent film. It is definitely one of my favorite Tim Allen performances. There are quotes in this film that are very, very good. The whole film is pretty much famous. Quite frankly, I can not believe this only has a 5.9 rating. I just can not believe it.A man named Scott Calvin accidentally becomes the new Santa Claus after he kills the old Santa Claus. He goes to the North Pole and finds out that there are little Elf children working. The Head Elf tells Scott that he has eleven months before he officially becomes Santa Claus. Through the months he is getting fatter for no apparent reason, maybe it is because he eats nothing but sweets. He grows a beard. When he tries to shave it off, it grows back. He finds out he is Santa Claus. Then Scott is arrested. The police thought he had kidnapped Charlie. Scott is divorced, by the way. Then the Elves swat team group rescue him. In the end Scott deliveries presents to all the nice little children.Overall, this is, again, a fantastic Holiday film that I would recommend to anyone who wants a flick to watch over the Holidays. It is a spectacular film for kids and even adults. Although movies like A Christmas Story and Christmas Vacation are better, this film will always have a special little place in my heart. Anyway, this is a fun-filled family film that is bound to be in your favorite Holiday films of all time. It is in mine.9/10Recommended Films Santa Claus 2.

Directed by John Pasquin and starring Home Improvement Tim Allen, The Santa Clause promises to be a moving update on a classic Christmas fable - the story of Santa Claus.The story of the jolly old fat guy in a red coat who flies around the world on Christmas Eve in his sleigh with eight reindeer is lore known to all who believe. But in an age when science and reason have been known to kill children's fantasies, Disney again proves that seeing is believing (or in the case of the film, believing is seeing). While at 21 years of age, I certainly know there's no Santa, though there is always your inner-child telling you to believe that Christmas is the season of miracles, and that is exactly what transpires in The Santa Clause.Scott Calvin (Allen), the typical, overworked (and divorced) American dad, is one such disbeliever. His job as a corporate exec high up on the ladder of a successful toy manufacturing firm has put him at odds with his young son Charlie (Eric Lloyd), ex-wife Laura (Wendy Crewson) and her new husband Neil (Judge Reinhold), who's also a disbeliever and pig-headed psychiatrist but is otherwise a nice guy. As the holidays are approaching, Scott has custody of Charlie, who would rather be with his mother and Neil, since Scott doesn't know how to cook (he sets fire to the Christmas turkey) and the two wind up spending Christmas Eve at Denny's.Through this moving and fun Christmas-time picture, the filmmakers throw in a legal side After Scott reads The Night Before Christmas to Charlie and turns in for the night, the two are awakened to find a guy in a red suit on their roof. A mishap occurs and said gentleman on the roof slides off to his doom. Scott finds a business card in the man's suit that informs him that by putting on the coat, he has entered into a legal binding (The Santa Clause, with an e at the end, meaning the last sentence of a contract, as explained by Bernard the Elf, played by David Krumholtz) to assume the rights and responsibilities of Santa Claus.So after one hectic night of delivering presents to children around the world and visiting his North Pole home and workshop, life returns to normal for Scott and Charlie, or so it seems. Charlie has apparently become so enamored by the experience that he believes his father really is Santa Claus. To the disbelievers, Charlie is just stuck in a child's fantasy. But as the year rolls on and the holidays are once again around the corner, Scott starts growing white hair and a beard and begins putting on the pounds, and it is clear that there is some holiday magic going on. (The movie also manages to resolve two ages-old questions that have nagged us all, including how Santa shoves his big old self down chimneys and how he's able to make his nightly rounds on Christmas Eve.)For all its typical Disney kind-hearted-ness, director Pasquin and his screenwriters Leo Benvenuti and Steve Rudnick manage to effectively capture everything there is to really love about the Jolly Old Fat Guy. Allen, everybody's favorite television comedian, fills out his role as the lousy-dad Scott Calvin who is inexplicably transformed into every kid's favorite holiday hero. As Allen gains weight at an incredible pace (courtesy of a body suit), this poor sap goes from doubter to believer in no time. Lloyd is a delight too, as young Charlie and whose love for his father transcends normal father-son relationships as he accompanies him on his holiday rounds.With the holidays rapidly approaching, it's time for me to get some Christmas shopping done, and down with watching some good ol' holiday movies.10/10 "},{"Title":"hohohoho!!!!! hahahahaSANTACLAUSIEhahahahahaa!!!!!","Date":"4 September 2006","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":" I'm laughing just from thinking about this movie!!!!!

It's not that I dislike him, I just don't get the appeal.  This entry is a very 90's-hip version of the Santa Claus tale, complete with child custody and visitation issues.  Workaholic Tim gets lasso-ed into replacing the current Santa Clause on legal technicality.  I may be alone, but I thought the plot progression from there was disquieting, unpleasant and just plain bizarre. Maybe I missed the point, but I didn't think much of this film.

For some reason, I think they have, making a little more solid family films.This turned out to be yet another modern-day family film that had all the typical Disney features a story based on a character who lies frequently; a number of subtle sex jokes (such as obscene telephone numbers), a snotty and unrealistic lead kid who uses an unrealistic vocabulary and is shown to be more mature than his bumbling Dad. (Intelligence, loving fathers are never found in these PC fiasco's). And, of course, we have the divorced family the only kind Hollywood knows.Other than that, it's a nice holiday family film!

Tim Allen is as personable as Santa Claus as a wet piece of bread. He plays a divorced father, of course, who takes the place of Santa Claus when the real Santa is killed. Hilarious stuff. Lots of typical Disney poo-poo humor and meaningless sub-plots to fill in the vapid film. The movie relies on special effects and shallow humor to mask it's patronizing nature. If the Tim Allen character couldn't even keep his wife happy, what makes an audience think he can spread joy to the entire world as Santa Claus? Tim Allen is a horrible actor who only knows one speed, he's definitely not versatile and every sentimental scene in the movie seems false and forced. The movie may have been popular, but that does not mean that it was good. The jokes in the movie already seem dated and stale, like Michael Jackson's career, people one day will not be raving how good it was, but why in the world in the first place did they like this travesty. Bound for the rubbish bin of the 90's.

This Sinter Klaus was changed to Santa Claus for English-speaking countries where he adopted the role of the more generic character of 'Father Christmas'. Since the dawn of Xmas Commercialism the Santa image has been used by pretty much everyone to sell their crappy products. THIS is how kids in modern society are introduced to a such a ridiculous fantasy figure. Why do any parents feed their kids this nonsensical crap? Imagination is fine. But lying to them about something that a 5-year-old should be able to see through is stupid.That said, as purely a fantasy movie, The Santa Clause is quite amusing. But maybe a bit too obnoxious to be a Xmas Classic. It was only made to cash-in on Tim Allen's Home Improvement success (and directed by a Home Improvement director) on the Disney Channel (which is even referenced rather unsubtly). I suppose it was a lucrative idea, but since I believe Tim Allen is completely talentless it's not really his own success. Santa Claus sells. Not Tim Allen. That's why all his other movies have been complete failures.Allen plays the curiously initialled Scott Calvin, a man who accidentally kills Santa on Xmas Eve. Once he puts on the dead man's jacket he becomes the new Santa and is whisked away to the North Pole. Over the next year he undergoes a transformation from ordinary guy to fat, jolly fellow with a big, white beard. Much to the shock of his ex-wife and baffled boss Peter Boyle (who would later star in the sequels as Father Time).I know that this is strictly a movie for kids but even before I reached double digits I questioned the logic behind 'Santa'. Even the movie lacks basic sense-making. Why would anyone doubt the existence of the movie character Santa Claus? Who do they think delivers free gifts to their children every year? It doesn't add up! If you show this to your kids and back up the lunatic conspiracy that this junk is real then shame on you. If you tell them that it is a load of crap and that the film is strictly make-belief then bravo!

The underlying premise of the movie -- the violent death of the patron saint of children, treated as goofy slapstick -- is repellent, and none of the some forty-thousand extraneous subplots the filmmakers tack on can change this.What I hate most about this film is its smarminess.  Disney Studios has the ability, and the money, to make good comedies -- for example, its recent effort _The Kid_ was witty and entertaining.  But in lowest-common denominator efforts like _The Santa Clause,_ the Studio chucks all reliance on plot, character, or invention, and relies instead on what it imagines children will find amusing.  When Tim Allen first encounters Santa's reindeer, it's a no-brainer that one of them will be flatulent; hey, kids just love flatulence jokes!  When Tim as Santa drinks a glass of milk, of course he thinks it's turning sour!  Kids just adore gross-out humor!  Everything in the movie is on autopilot, including the de rigeur badguy, the lame fat jokes, the whiny kid who saves the day and crawls under your skin like a parasite, and the treacly, nauseating ending in which I guess we are supposed to learn the true meaning of Christmas.  No films anger me as much as mediocre films -- films that are not willing to take a chance.  It is amazing how this film can take such a gruesome premise and play it off as a joke -- there is not even a moment's mourning for the passing of poor St. Nicholas.  In the ideal world, Frank Capra would rise from the dead and slap the snot out of Tim Allen for making such a cruel and lukewarm holiday film.

It really makes me personally angry that movies like this make enough money that about a dozen of them a year get green-lighted. I have to wonder if it's the cold draconian efficiency of the marketing companies that handle these accounts, or it it's just the lack of sophistication and sense of humor within the general viewing public. Realistically, it's probably the marketers. They're kind of Stalinesque, really. "}]
