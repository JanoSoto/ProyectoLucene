[{"Title":"The Crossing Guard (1995)","Date":"19 January 2004","Score":"33 out of 38 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  Most films you see nowadays are directed from a very logical standpoint the plot is mapped out and it's followed to a T, and the ending neatly wraps things up so that when you leave the theater, you feel relieved that things worked out. But every now and then, a film-maker will make a picture from a purely emotional standpoint. Rather than creating a structured outline, he'll rely on the ambiance of each scene to compose a more true to life -- if at times incoherent -- piece of storytelling. The Crossing Guard is such a film. Directed by actor-turned-film-maker Sean Penn (whose first effort was 1991's The Indian Runner), it is a meandering, ponderous movie about grief and the value of life, and while at times it seems unbalanced, the end result is quite stunning. The film opens with what may appear to be a perplexing correlation first we see a woman sitting silently in a support group for parents who lost their children, and then we cut to a man drinking heavily in a strip bar. The woman is Mary (played by Anjelica Huston), and the man is Freddy Gale (played by Jack Nicholson), and together they were the parents of a little girl who was killed in a car accident by a drunk driver named John (Wilkes?) Booth (played by David Morse, who was also in The Indian Runner). And while they may be dealing with it in totally different ways, they are both having difficulty coping with the loss of their child. But when John is released from prison, Freddy suddenly announces to his now ex-wife Mary that he will kill him in an attempt to relieve their pain. The premise is indeed stale, but by showing it in such a different light than its similar predecessors, Penn manages to create genuine intensity from what would otherwise be another Death Wish sequel. Nicholson delivers yet another amazing performance, and after seeing him in so many tough roles, it is truly shattering to watch him break down in tears. And while I personally felt that Morse was miscast, he still does a terrific job with the role. Anjelica Huston and Robin Wright Penn are top-notch, but honorary mention must be given to Priscilla Barnes (Three's Company, Licence to Kill), whose subtle grace makes her near-insignificant character beam with humanity. Also, keep your eyes peeled for an appearance by Piper Laurie (Children of a Lesser God, Twin Peaks) as John's loving mother. In the end, The Crossing Guard is a film about family all of the characters' actions are done out of love, which brings Freddy's dilemma over whether or not to avenge his daughter more close-to-home than it might otherwise have been. Penn's direction is excellent, but at times he tries a little too hard to provoke emotions that don't come naturally. The Crossing Guard isn't quite as powerful as it wants to be, but it comes very close. It's one of the most over-looked pictures of the decade.SIDE-NOTE In a scene where Priscilla Barnes is pouring her heart out to Nicholson while he's lying in bed smoking a cigarette, there's a close-up of his hand, and you'll notice that he has a ring on his ring finger. Later on in the film, when he and his ex-wife are talking in a diner, the ring is still there ... but it has switched to his pinky finger. This is the kind of absolute characterization that makes The Crossing Guard more special than you might think it to be upon first glance.Grade B "},{"Title":"Peculiar and exciting work from Sean Penn","Date":"19 March 2002","Score":"32 out of 40 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  The Crossing guard is not a completely typical or usual thriller. When it comes to actors David Morse has an incredibly nice, gentle and friendly looks. It's really hard to imagine him playing twisted criminals and psychopaths. On the other hand Jack Nicholson's looks - as we all know - are one of the most dreadful and devilish there is. His sinister eyes and evil expressions were the vitality of the movies like The Shining, The Witches of Eastwick, Batman or Wolf. The secret behind the suspense of The Crossing guard is to put these two men in the same film and make Nicholson's character Freddy Gale hunt down David Morse's John Booth. The latter is responsible for the death of Gale's daughter Emily but he's not a bad man. He made a mistake, went to prison for it and is trying to keep on living with dead girl on his conscience. This splendid, interesting idea works perfectly. The last picture of The Crossing guard is very emotional, very touching and it wraps the whole film beautifully together. Thrilling The Crossing guard is Jack Nicholson's finest performances of the 90's and probably the best one of the three movies Sean Penn has directed so far. Watch it!

When I saw it again a few years ago I almost had the same reaction.What's different about this film is the message forgiveness. That's really what it's about and it's done in a touching way even though most of the characters in here are anything but nice, sentimental people. If you can enjoy a good character-development story and not get too dismayed by a depressing scene or two this movie will reward you with some intangibles that are hard to describe unless you've seen this. Jack Nicholson, David Morse, Angelica Huston and Robin Wright make for an interesting foursome, I'll say that. Nicholson, particularly, impressed me with an untypically-subdued role for him. (Note The profanity and nudity in here was totally unnecessary and the film would have been better without it. The story was powerful enough on its own.)If you don't like this movie, I would understand that, too. It's not an easy film to like. It will either haunt you or put you to sleep. It haunted me.

I found this very surprising as I expected Nicholson to flood the screen, as he so often does with such little difficulty.However, the emotion between Huston and Nicholson in the latter half of the film during the coffee shop scene is so powerful to watch. Huston is such a wonderful actress, and Nicholson shows some emotional depth that I haven't seen before, or rather, not felt with his performance before.The story is written and planned extremely well, with tension rising slowly and almost imperceptibly, until the final day. I found myself caught from the opening scenes of the counselling session cut with the drunken, partying Nicholson, right through to the pivotal moments of the main characters lives.It is a fantastic way to address this subject. To examine it from both sides, and keep each side with its own sympathies and understandings. Cleverly your sympathies and hatred are swapped throughout the story.I hope there's more to come like this.

Of course, I do volunteer work with dying folks and help train aspiring grief counselors to deal with the traumas that life all too often brings us.  I can only assume that those who so quickly dismiss this powerful meditation on grief and remorse have yet to experience these real life emotions.  Something by Schwarzenegger may be more to their taste, or one of the ubiquitous comic book recreations we encounter most summers with cardboard characters and pseudo emotions.Sean Penn is plumbing much deeper regions of the human psyche, and doing so with actors of rare talent, fully capable of sharing with us their heart rending vulnerabilities.  Few actors have the courage to go to the places these actors visit as they face suffering almost too great to bear.  I'm reminded of the more recent Mystic River for which Sean Penn received an Academy award for best actor, a movie that explores equally traumatizing events.  It was heartening to watch the joy with which this award was greeted by his fellow professionals who have long acknowledged this man's genius both in front of and behind the camera.  This movie deserves a much wider audience of discriminating movie viewers.

Anyone who says Sean Penn is a hack is full of it. This guy knows how to direct, there is no question about it. But what he is directing? That's another matter.The Crossing Guard has way too many 'hollywood' elements for it's own good. Kind of reminded me of 21 Grams in that way. Where 21 Grams was a Hollywood-version of addiction, The Crossing Guard is a Hollywood-version of crime and punishment. There is no clear villain and there is no clear victim. I guess we are all victims, aren't we Sean? Okay, first of all why did Booth get out of prison for killing a girl while drunk driving and his friends throw him a welcome home party with alcohol being served? Only in Hollywood. We are given a small glimpse of Booth's character but not enough to really feel bad for him. Nicholson's character, Gale, is a real creep. He makes it pretty tough to feel sorry for him at all. So the viewer is torn, right up until the end of the movie. The ending throws you for an emotional roller coaster that will make some people laugh and no doubt make others cry, but it is definitely strange. A frantic Gale shooting Booth, then handing his gun over to him.Fine acting, fine directing, just not a great story here. Then there was Robin Wright.

"},{"Title":"A Missed Opportunity","Date":"30 July 2015","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" The film opens with a rather strange juxtaposition of two scenes. One features a group of grieving parents discussing how they have dealt with the loss of their children. The other features a topless stripper playing with fire. The Crossing Guard at its heart is how people deal with grief differently and the consequences those choices have for all. Some parents would prefer to pour their heart out. Others choose more destructive outlets, like patronize strip clubs. Jack Nicholson, the father of a girl killed by a drunk driver, spends some of his nights at strip clubs, while Anjelica Huston, the mother of that girl and Nicholson's ex-wife, spends time listening to those grief stricken parents pouring their hearts out. Like that opening juxtaposition the film's points are hit with all the nuance of a sledgehammer pounding in a nail.Therefore, little attention is paid to how Huston's character attempts to come to terms with the death of her child; instead, the focus is on how Nicholson destructively grieves for his daughter. Of course he wants revenge. And of course this quest for revenge, the film tells us, doesn't solve anything but only further eats away at him.Nicholson, who still seems to be in Joker mode from his stint in that role in the Batman franchise, is as over the top as one might expect. The character he's saddled with is a difficult one to play to be sure, but Nicholson makes his character so over bearing and indignant that his presence soon becomes toxic. Instead of exploring his character's inner grief and psychology the film would rather just show his temper tantrums. David Morse, as the drunk driver who killed Nicholson's daughter, is, by contrast, and surprisingly, shown as some kind of repentant saint. He knows what he did, feels terrible about it, and tries to communicate it to an obstinate Nicholson. But in general Morse isn't given much to do other than stare into space stoically. Huston, however, it must be said is quite good even if the film doesn't really care about her and only utilizes her to show how crazy Nicholson's character has become.The middle part of the film, where Nicholson parties with some strippers (including Three's Company's Priscilla Barnes) and Morse's character meets up with some bohemians, is a total bore. Another subplot of Morse falling in love with Robin Wright Penn adds nothing to the plot other than act as filler so the film can reach the standard 120 minute run time. Finally, the closing sequence of the film, which includes a chase (or in Nicholson's case a fast walk) through LA and ends with a kumbaya moment in a graveyard as the sun is slowly rising and the tedious score swelling, is totally ridiculous. What's most disappointing here is that at its core The Crossing Guard could have been a good film. Sean Penn has directed other fine films (especially Into the Wild) and Nicholson, at least prior to the '90s, is a first-rate actor. But totally lacking nuance in performance and story and weighed down by a miserable second half and a hokey conclusion renders this film instead largely a failure.

Its merits and demerits are by now well understood by anyone reading a series of reviews. The movie is too long. The writing leaves in too many repetitive scenes and doesn't come up with enough scenes that reveal character through action. The direction allows too much over-acting by Jack Nicholson. The ending is contrived, not really believable and feels manipulative. The directing and story-telling try to be arty but come across as being unsure. We are watching Sean Penn develop as a writer and director. I can only encourage his efforts, but he has a ways to go. My recollection is that The Pledge was a much better film. He needs someone to take him through the film step by step and point out where it's going wrong.Roger Ebert understands this particular film and points out that it's more about Nicholson's character having become alcoholic over the loss of his daughter when she was killed by the drunken David Morse. He then loses the respect of his wife and his own self-respect. He crosses over to become what Morse was, while Morse in prison crosses over or tries to eliminate his guilt. It stays and is a heavy burden, however. Both men are burdened. Nicholson wants to kill Morse to show himself and his estranged wife (Angelica Huston) that he's a man. Revenge too. The paths of these two men are crossed, as they must be. Penn shows this cinematically by interweaving their two lives, even dissolving from one face to another, from one love-making to the other. But this is exactly where the film gets too slow and repeats its messages and hits us over the head.About 3/4 of the way through, I felt this film had zero tension, despite the fact that it had a time limit device in it. The outcome was never in doubt. Still, at that point, Penn tried to pick up the pace with the unexpected occurrence, a run-in of Nicholson with some cops, and then a chase scene that ended with the movie's climactic and moving final scene, contrived, not really believable and overly sentimental as it was.The script tried to motivate Nicholson's absurd behavior when he's stopped by cops for driving erratically by showing him as quite violent earlier. But the scene made little sense unless Nicholson is really cracking up, and even then it doesn't ring true. He has told his wife he's cracking up. We hear it. We see he has a temper. But somehow we do not really get his behavior. The screenplay needed some material that better showed this man than one strip club scene after another. We needed to see something that would help us understand his final interaction with Morse. Morse's character was easier to understand, and Morse shows again what a fine actor he is. Not that Jack Nicholson is not. He can really deliver the goods and often does, but he needs a good direction to extract just the right amount of emoting and expression. He overdoes the facial contortions in his big scene with Huston in the restaurant to the point where we do not grasp what he feels until he tells us verbally in an outburst.The movie is a nice try, hopefully a learning experience for Sean Penn, whom I commend for putting this out there where in a sense he goes naked as an artist. It does provide dramatic entertainment but at the price of feeling let down by its writing and directing issues.

But here is the needle in the haystack.Nicholson's performance is overacted, uninspired, and adolescent. And as if that wasn't bad enough, Anjelica Huston seems to follow suit! It's almost as if there was a bad-acting virus on the set.However one actor who had apparently been vaccinated was David Morse. This is probably the one and only bright spot in the movie. Morse is fantastic. His portrayal of John Booth is convincing, multi-dimensional, and consistent. It is twice as amazing that Morse was able to pull off such an impressive job when one considers that he had to play off the pitiful Nicholson. Robin Wright did give Morse at least something to work with as her performance was fairly good, although hampered by the story.....which brings us to the worst aspect of the movie--the screenplay. Imagine a story called, The hammer hits the nail, where viewers are forced to watch an ultra-slo-mo of a hammer coming down on a nail, periodically broken up by sporadic, unnecessary banter, and you have this in a nutshell. The story is painfully predictable, and morbidly slow-moving. One walks away saying, That was it? But I already knew that. The actual story should only take about 5 minutes. The rest is filler. And bad filler.The climax of the movie (if one can call it that) is a pathetically unrealistic chase scene where the out-of-shape, 50-something, smoking alcoholic character played by Nicholson out runs the young, muscular and fit Morse over a distance of some 3 miles or so (although it seems like 20 miles to the viewer). Nothing is given away by this description however, since most viewers already know how a movie like this will end.The title of the film, The Crossing Guard is of course irrelevant to all but self-described film experts who have infinite time and desire to conjure up the real meaning of films and teach them to the rest of us. However, it most likely refers to the tragic failure of a talent-guard to catch this script before it made it to production.

It starts with a given for a gripping premise a man torn completely psychologically from himself, Freddy (Jack Nicholson) finds out the man who killed his daughter in a drunk driving accident is released from prison after only six years. And, he'll go and kill him. Why he'll kill him, also a psychological pull, is that he's more so for his ex-wife Mary (Angelica Huston) than he is for himself. It's as much, if not more, about pride than it is about vengeance. But through this premise, and the divide between self-destructive, drunk Freddy and the guilt-ridden, morose John Booth, Penn paints his characters sometimes into corners even when things become most intriguing. It's appropriate, I suppose, that Penn decided to dedicate the film to Charles Bukowski, as it probably alludes a lot to the moods of the characters in those books. But in putting across moods so much he almost forgets that his actors need believable circumstances to follow. One device, for example, is the whole you got three days angle Freddy pulls with John when he first confronts him in his trailer. There's also the sort of romance-in-limbo between John and another woman (Robin Wright Penn).But what I didn't expect was that the actors almost don't, but ultimately do, rise above the contrivances of the script. There's even a great scene between Nicholson and Huston in a restaurant the night the murder is supposed to take place. Scenes like this, and a tear-ridden phone call from Freddy in a red-tinted room, are powerful and connect with the overall theme of loss in the film. Yet as a director Penn doesn't pull enough with his characters and mood to make it as compelling as it can be. He also relies on some fairly arty camera moves to make it more interesting, when they aren't needed anyway. Nicholson and Morse, meanwhile, are consummate pros who get into their characters completely (and for Nicholson especially it's almost a walk in the park, with his motivation less about the death of his daughter than it is about decay itself). But what is the audience to make of the mediocre decision to have Freddy get pulled over by the cops on his way to kill John, for drunk driving, and then go into a very far-fetched chase from them to catch up to John just so the irony can be placed in? It's not that the actors don't use some devices either at their disposal.However in the case of the Crossing Guard, no matter how deeply felt Penn is to his material- leading up to a somewhat meaningful ending at the cemetery- he doesn't give it all to actors who demand more from him. I also think having seen this after seeing the Pledge, a brilliant drama with many of the same themes of redemption from another's death and loss from it all, rises so much more above similar ground in this picture. Not bad, but not great either- sort of an unfulfilled, if always watchable, middle-ground.

However now that the killer, John Booth, has been released Freddie has focus and aims to kill him in revenge.  However nothing is that simple.Sean Penn, Jack Nicholson and David Morse are pretty much going to be worth a look as they are all pretty intense actors when given the material to work with.  In this film Penn is the writer and director and, unfortunately, he is not as good as writing as he is the other facets of his job.  Here the film is pretty good but has one massive problem that it cannot get over - the script.  The film is based on clichés that you will have seen before. This itself is not a problem as, although the characters are familiar, it's what you do with them that counts - not their basic descriptions.However the film doesn't actually do much with these basic characters and, what it does, is confused and clichéd as much as the basics are!  The `message' of the film will be different for everyone so I won't go into that but suffice to say that the characters are never really explained and it is impossible to really feel for any of them.  They drift aimlessly for an hour or so just `feeling' in a story that borders on the dull, before something happens that has any meaning - and even then you could see it coming.  The script wants to be deep and meaningful, and it appears to have fooled several people on this site, but really it is hollow and really lacking in anything close to engagement.It is even more tragic when you see the potential that the film had.  As director, Penn does pretty well with good atmosphere and style.  Likewise the cast could have been great but are mostly left to aimlessly drift with a script they can't work with.  You can tell Penn is an actor by the way he seems to have been content to let the actor's `explore the space' or, in my terms, do what they want.  Morse is a good actor but here he is lumbered with a man who has done all his suffering off camera resulting in him being a bland character with nothing left to explore in front of us.  Huston is given nothing of value to do and the inclusion of Robin Wright Penn can surely be nothing but nepotism.Overall there is a good film in here somewhere, but this is not it.

David Morse plays against type; there is a softness to his portrayal, a quality I had not seen in his more recent appearances. Robin Wright plays what might be the most interesting of characters, the woman sympathetic to her lover's situation, but unwilling to live with his sorrow.The story, in quite a subtle way, keeps the viewer shifting his / her sympathy between two of the main characters (played by St. Elsewhere's David Morse, and Nicholson); I was never certain about for whom to root. But in the final third of the movie, a definite moral tone takes over; the film became, for me, a message movie. It's earlier edginess is lost.

Guilt oozes out of this epic and nothing about it is remotely entertaining. Jack Nicholson is terrific as Freddy Gale, a jewelry store owner and alcoholic who believes that he must exact vengeance on the drunken driver who struck his daughter Emily, but he is far from likable. I'd call this a film rather than a movie because you only need to watch it once to know you seen it one time too many. David Morse is just as good as the drunken driver who served time for vehicular homicide. These two men are filled with guilt, though they finally make up at the end with our protagonist finally visits his daughter's grave. As well made as The Crossing Guard is, it is not the kind of movie you want to see for the sake of sheer entertainment. All the technical credits are top-notch and the film never wears out its welcome. John Savage has a brief role near the beginning and then he vanishes. Robin Wright plays John Booth's momentary girlfriend who ends their relationship because she has too much trouble competing with his guilt. Robbie Robertson is good as the husband who replaced Freddy. Richard Bradford and Piper Laurie appear briefly at the beginning as John Booth's parents who come to pick him up at the prison when he gets out. Sean Penn's father Leo has a cameo, too. Skip this one unless you're feeling really terrible and need a purging.

Nicholson finds Mr. Morse living in a trailer on his parents' property and aims his gun - but the weapon malfunctions. Nicholson's verbal blue-streak wakes Morse from his sleep. Morse asks for two, but Nicholson gives him three days to live. By then, that gun should be fixed...Morse admits, It only hurts the first time, when describing his sexual activity in prison, then he hooks up with beautiful Robin Wright (as Jojo). She will hook up with writer/director Sean Penn, behind-the-scenes...Nicholson's Freddy continues to get drunk and pick-up arousing strippers. There is an eye-opening look at topless Pricilla Barnes (as Verna), who holds up well against the younger beauties. After the three days, Nicholson goes to kill Morse again. There is irony in the fact that Nicholson is most likely a drunk driver who wasn't as unlucky as the one who struck down his daughter. This is obvious from the beginning, but it may be intended as a big reveal. There are big, competent names attached to The Crossing Guard who are big and competent throughout; yet, you may never completely forget who they are and what you're watching.****** The Crossing Guard (9/10/95) Sean Penn ~ Jack Nicholson, David Morse, Robin Wright, Anjelica Huston "},{"Title":"Not good enough","Date":"16 February 2010","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" First of all, I wanted to like this movie. I like Penn (in both his acting roles and 'some' as director - 'Into The Wild' was fantastic), I like Morse and Nicholson is a good addition as well. The subject of the movie resonates with me too - a father wanting to exact revenge on the drunk-driver killer of his little girl. What father wouldn't feel like that? However, mashing all this together for a film - it just doesn't work.Why? For me - the story was too meandering, too off-the-beaten-track to hook in the viewer. Nicholson's erratic behaviour as a drink-guzzling, topless bar frequenting Lothario - although giving us a look into how his life has become empty and shallow - does not give us much sympathy for him. He tracks down his daughter's killer and gives him 3 days grace. After such time, he will come and shoot him dead. The first question in my mind was why? Why not kill him there and then - get it over with - after all he had been waiting 7 years already.Morse - who had obviously pumped iron for the intervening time in jail - plays his part as best as he can. He's not given much in the way of a script to flesh out his character but he does well to personalise and internalise the pain. Nicholson does okay too - his acting a little spotty at times but in the main he holds it together quite well. A decent turn from Angelica Huston adds to the film. Robin Wright-Penn though does not. It's not entirely her fault as her part is completely irrelevant as Morse's not-quite-love-interest. (In one scene - which I had to replay to see if I saw it properly the first time - I thought Morse had broken her neck for no apparent reason. But it turned out to be a cuddle. Strangest cuddle ever if you ask me.) So the movie meanders through a series of not very exciting moments until we end up at the end of the 3 days with a chase between Nicholson and Morse. This, although leading to some redemption, is almost laughable. First of all Nicholson is an old man, coming off the back of a night of beer and cigarettes and generally out of shape. Morse, on the other hand, looks like a clean-living, hard-working, in-shape perfect human specimen - but yet cannot outrun his predator. A preposterous chase from his trailer through the streets of downtown (where Nicholson has umpteen opportunities to kill his prey and doesn't) ends up in the graveyard where the little girl is buried. Causing both men to finally find some solace and finality.Poor.Don't get me too wrong here - there are some nice scenes, some good dialog too but it is ruined by an unfocused script and an ending that has to be seen to be dis-believed. Penn has had worse outputs than this and he is clearly learning his craft as he goes along but this does go down as a thumbs down rather than up.I'll give it 6/10 for an honest effort at telling a well-worn story in a different way but it was a disappointment at the end of the day.

I think his ego is so enormous that it almost always oozes out of his performances making them dripping with sarcasm and over acted scenes. He has done some good films both recently and in the past but overall he thinks he is far better than he is. However it wasn't until the credits rolled on The Crossing Guard that I knew Mr. Sean Penn himself had directed and wrote this powerful film and kudos to him because he did an incredible job. The Crossing Guard is gritty, dark, bleak, a sad and depressing look into grief and death that will not bring you to tears but rather horror at how deep grief can take someone. That someone that we see gives such a powerful performance that I might go so far as to say that it is one of his best performances if not THEE best to date. Penn must known something about grief and the dark place a human can go because he captures the emotion like no other film I have ever seen and perhaps he owes a big part of that to his cast. I am still completely confused by the title...I mean I get that The Crossing Guard watches Nicholson's character as he almost makes his kill but other than that I don't make the connection. But title aside this is a must see film!! Jack Nicholson plays Freddy Gale, the completely distraught, hopelessly depressed and lost father of a young girl killed by a drunk driver that spiraled his life into hopelessness. He lost his wife, his two sons who now know his ex-wife's new husband as Dad. He's got questionable business practices running a seed Jewellery store, and his only friends and hang out are in a strip joint. Gale is such an intriguing and incredibly depthy and emotional character. I have never seen Nicholson embrace a character like this and take the film goer on such an incredible ride of emotions. This is a Nicholson MUST SEE performance and he should have been praised to no end for this role. It's under rated and his best and he's done some incredible work. The role of Freddie Gale is like this fragile bomb that is falling apart and ready to explode at any moment which is a suspenseful character to say the least. Anjelica Huston brilliantly plays Freddie's ex-wife Mary whom still cares for her ex-husband but has tried to piece her life back together after the death of their daughter. Huston and Nicholson's scenes together are stunning and her character is a showing of grief from a completely different perspective but just as interesting. She is very good in this performance and Golden Globe nominated which is deserved but a sham considering Nicholson was shut out. The incredible David Morse rounds out the main cast as the man who killed their daughter John Booth. Booth has now just been released from prison and must try to fit into society all the while dealing with his own guilt and grief for the murder he committed. He is equally as emotional and depthy as any of the other characters and once again shows another side of grief to the story.I can't speak enough about the absolute brilliance of this film. It captures pain and emotion like no other film I've ever seen and brilliantly and perfectly shows it from three very different angles and each one just as powerful as the next although we are seeing the story through the eyes of the completely devastated and angry Freddy Gale. The tone of the film is so depressing and brings you through such a range of emotions it's almost hard to bear. I definitely don't recommend this film to anyone who has lost someone recently because it's a tough film to watch but important and so powerful. An absolute classic that is not treated like one...a rare and stunning piece of cinema. 10/10 "},{"Title":"When will we get over things?","Date":"16 April 2006","Score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" When The Crossing Guard came out, it seemed like we'd heard for years that Sean Penn was worthless and just got in a bunch of fights.

However, the material he has to work with is just not enough for him to save the film. The story, one of sadness, grief, loss, and revenge - is a little odd and lacking realism in my opinion, even though it is striving for absolute reality in human emotions.                                    The character of Freddy Gale, played by Nicholson, is out to avenge his daughter's death by a drunk driver, played by the very good actor David Morse. POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD - Morse is released from Jail, and Nicholson's years of waiting for revenge and planning for what he will do culminates in his having an empty pistol? It's true that any strange thing can happen in reality, but movies have to maintain a certain credibility, not just portray what could possibly happen to a mixed up, grieving guy. The film tries to show that people aren't really sure what they want or know what to do, which is true, but it seems to stretch this concept to absurdity. The final chase scene ends up being unintentionally funny, and reminded me a lot of the chase scene between Kramer and the Cable Man on Seinfeld. It had a ridiculous quality to it, going from street to bus to cemetery. Just making Nicholson keep up with the obviously healthier looking Morse character was quite a stretch, and Morse's character's plan of having Freddy Gale follow to the gravesite is pretty half baked.     The heart of the movie is an attempt to show regret and forgiveness, but it just doesn't come across in a credible way. Give this one a pass, and cross the video aisle safely!

Quite a mixed bags.  Those folks who've praised David Morse's performance are dead on--he really gets across a character who is deeply wounded by guilt, and even worse, realizes the guilt is harming those around him.  He really overcomes a rather bland script to flesh out the character quite well.  On the other hand, Jack Nicholson overacts rather badly, his character is a hate filled jeweler bent on killing the drunk driver (Morse) who caused the death of his daughter.  He's so filled with rage and bitterness, he ends up drinking excessively and hanging out a strip clubs and bars.  Nicholson, probably not a stranger to either, gnaws on the scenery in those parts. There's subplot with Robin Wright which seems mostly to be filler, as with a strange party Morse goes to that devolves into a group therapy session.  The supporting characters are uniformly good, like Piper Laurie as Morse's mother and guess who shows up and is surprisingly good?  Robbie Robertson of all people playing Nicholson's ex-wife's (a nicely acted Anjelica Huston) new husband.  The end is a deep disappointment, though (SPOILER) it does communicate the fact that Nicholson, so bitter at his daughter's death has never visited her grave.  Worth a look, go in realizing Sean Penn isn't able to really bring off the story, but manages to get some good performances out of his actors--too bad he couldn't control Nicholson more (who puts in great performances fifty percent of the time, Hoffa was abysmal but As Good As It Gets was as good as any acting gets).

Operating with no direction at all, Nicholson gives his worst performance since Hell's Angels on Wheels. Only David Morse, the baby-faced doctor from TV's excellent St. Elsewhere, distinguishes himself with a controlled characterization worthy of a decent script.Although I do not question his sincerity with this project, Sean Penn really should stick to acting, and if he refuses to abandon his writer/director pretensions, the least he could do is hire actors whose abilities are as limited as his own.

Freddy Gale (Jack Nicholson) licks his chops; vows to his wife Mary (Angelica Huston) he's going to kill this killer of his daughter - Booth ran her down accidentally on a school crossing; his jail time was for that manslaughter. Freddy meets with Booth, gives him three days to get out of town before Freddy would come after him...It all seems like a nice setup for a popcorn B-Movie chase actioner. Which Penn righteously ignores, thank Christ! These characters are not Hollywood-ised in the least, even though the action takes place on those familiar streets. These are conflicted men, who deal with emotional aftershocks like swaying pendulums David Morse gives the performance of a lifetime as Booth, all raspy voice, muttonchop sideburns and jail mullet; guilt-ridden and welcoming Death's imminent embrace one minute, then filled with fake bravado the next, black sunglasses on at night, taunting the air, Come on! and willing Freddy to burst through his trailer door to cease the suspense. Jack makes his dead eyes deader as Freddy, a jeweler by trade, now a shell, sublimating his ferocious weeping anger in hookers and booze, trying to alternately kill himself and make plans to kill Booth.Robin Wright Penn is the very picture of empathy, as a woman whose embrace Booth falls into, but who can't compete with his guilt. Booth tells her of the accident, of how he knelt by Freddy's daughter after running her down and she was mouthing something - apologizing for not looking both ways.THE CROSSING GUARD makes the ground shift under our feet emotionally. We don't know whether to sympathize with a father's righteous anger or a manslaughterer's purgatorial guilt.It moves us in strange ways there is a blackly humorous scene where Freddy is dining a Mexican hooker while a band performs Love Hurts - in Mexican; then the ground shifts as Freddy weeps inconsolably on the phone to his wife; then shifts again, as he meets with her in a restaurant, only to end up indignant that she would deign to feel sorry for him feeling sorry for himself, and telling her he hopes she dies! Then shifts again Freddy hides from the police in the room of a little girl, whom he implores not to reveal him; she doesn't, the police leave, and he kisses her tenderly, Good night, sweetheart. Excellent scene where Freddy is pulled over by police, who actually act like police, rather than Movie Police.When Freddy gets to Booth, Booth gets the drop on him - but both men are so conflicted that now it is Freddy's turn to welcome death, confessing that he's on the run from police, he's trespassing, he's got a gun and he was drunk driving. If Booth shot him now, he would walk away clean; Freddy almost begs Booth to put him out of his misery, in a masculine displacement gesture I guess I'm gonna try and shoot you. As Booth and Freddy aim at each other, it's like a John Woo moment - without the stupidity.But Booth has something deeper in store. He drops his rifle and takes off, with Freddy giving chase half-heartedly. With a gun in his hand, Freddy could easily shoot him down, yet allows himself to be led, with Booth just out of range - until the KIDS IN THE HALL moment, where they both board a bus and Booth pays for Freddie and they sit at opposite ends, waiting to resume the chase on foot.Where Booth is leading Freddy is this movie's beating heart. It is so poignant and surprising that the King of Weeping has got me doing it as soon as the chase starts, because I know where it leads.We realize only in the last frames that Freddy has never visited his daughter's grave.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania) "},{"Title":"If You're Gonna Kill Him, Then Kill Him","Date":"13 June 2004","Score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  David Morse must have watched the Nicholson/Brando dungheap, 'The Missouri Breaks', before shooting began on Sean Penn's 'The Crossing Guard'. Why? Because he upstages Jack the same way Brando did all those years ago. Nicholson's got the jump on the de facto villain, who shrugs off the gun in his face and doesn't seem to care whether he lives or dies. This one failed scene in 'The Crossing Guard'---fascinating as it wants to be---punches holes in the movie like thumbtacks in a balloon. Are there no bullets in the gun because this is a half-hearted murder attempt or because the goofy ghost of Peter Sellers was hanging around to give some advice about incompetence? Whatever the case, the tone of this scene fatally damages a well-meaning movie.To explain Freddy Gale (Nicholson) has come to kill John Booth (Morse) for running over young Emily Gale while driving drunk. Booth has just been released from the hoosegow after serving 7 years. He may be repentant and sorrowful, but Freddy hasn't dealt with his daughter's death and all he wants from Booth is blood. Gale's ex-wife, Mary (Angelica Huston), has remarried and is raising Freddy's other kids with the new husband. She wants nothing to do with this crazy scheme, which angers Freddy even more. The failed assassination attempt early in the film allows for another hour & a half of expounding of grief and searching of soul. Then Gale comes gunning for Booth again after a three-day grace period.How often do you see Nicholson cry? He weeps 2 or 3 times here. This is the soulful actor working his craft the way he did in 'About Schmidt' and 'The Pledge', and I enjoy that just as much as when he's showboating. Still, the movie was a disappointment. The final moments might be about powerful ideas (forgiveness, acceptance), but what comes before prevents a genuine emotional catharsis. As good as the two male leads are separately, their 2 big scenes together thud like falling rocks. It doesn't help that the denouement features lucky coincidences and an almost comical chase. If the tone of the movie is wrong, the director must be held responsible.It's distinctly unfair to badmouth a flick that works as hard to be ABOUT something as this one does. So I won't throw spitballs, but I can't rave about it either. And I wanted so badly to like this movie. Clearly, Penn has a passion for this I want vengeance for my dead daughter story, since he wrote, directed, and produced 'The Crossing Guard' and also won an acting Oscar for 'Mystic River' (with its similar subject matter). For such a serious actor/director, I don't understand why he would push this grave film so close to satire.

There could have been a couple less bar scenes, as we know from the first several (and there were MANY) that Nicholson's character Freddy, was in a deep depression over the death of his daughter and his life was going nowhere.

The more anger Freddy portrayed, the worse his life went.  John on the other hand was very calm and although upset at the death he caused of the little girl, his life was running rather smoothly.  Morse and Nicholson were 2 excellent choices for the roles they played.

So boring! Why the heck is it called 'The Crossing Guard?' I wonder how many viewers of The Crossing Guard (TCG) said such things because they viewed the same DVD edition I watched. I read the back of the DVD box afterwards, and I had to laugh. It seems to have been produced by people who have no idea what the movie's about. The box's lurid, breathless text markets this as an action thriller, and makes it sound like a Death Wish or High Noon revenge showdown! A featured photo shows Freddy swingin' the chair.Although TCG revolves around revenge, and a gun features prominently, you almost won't know it. TCG is what you'd call a literate drama. The revenge Freddy plans to exact is the story's driving force, but the bulk of the plot is character study and psychological drama, its two feet very much on the ground.Unlike some literate dramas -- ponderous, pretentious attempts at art, with static filming to match -- TCG has the goods. It's a sensitive, curious examination of a difficult main character and real-life subject matter. Since TCG gets quite disturbing at times, not least of all because of its broken, volatile, oft-unlikable protagonist, watching can be a challenge, but nonetheless it's refreshing to watch a complicated drama that doesn't push saccharine messages or pretend to have easy answers. It simply lets its characters loose to find their own way through a rather open-ended plot, and never loses sight of their humanity even while it acknowledges their awful acts. Stick with TCG and it will prove to be a rewarding film with both a mind and heart.The literary genre's artsiness and realismo -- true-to-life folks who are quirky but not really funny, half-heard scraps of conversation -- create a few annoying bits in TCG, but not enough to damage the proceedings. Bobby's long speech at the survivor's support group reflects the reality of inarticulate people who can't speak from a polished script, but it doesn't do much for the film. You'll just have to chuckle through TCG's candle-strewn artists' party, of which only 10% of the dialogue makes a lick of sense. I admit that the John-Jojo relationship and pectoral-clutching push credibility.A better literate aspect in TCG is its humor, a pleasant surprise, especially coming from a writer/director better known for being humorless. When Freddy, falling apart from his rage, suddenly accepts the crowd's plea to join Mia the stripper on stage for a pole dance, it's remarkable, tense black comedy. Even better is when Freddy goes home with Mia, who surprises him by performing (and supposedly composing) a song for Freddy on her synthesizer decked out with blinking lights. Freddy just sits and watches in a stupor; whether it's from his booze or the music show is uncertain. In a Hitchcockian touch, a violent chase by foot detours into a city bus, and the participants must deal with bus fares, mistakes about the stops, and bickering passengers.

She admits that she feels as if she will never again want to feel affectionate towards a human-being as much as she did her brother, for the fear born out of further loss, in what is a revealing and frank monologue of sorts on the issue. It is an instance in which somebody exposes some deeply rooted emotions out of the death of a loved one, Penn's film, The Crossing Guard, branching out into a fascinating and far broader play on the subject allowing actions and highly strung mindsets to drive a look at anguish, a film covering an array of people of grossly differing ilks suffering in some form due to a fatality; the likes of which are an affecting mediation that doubles up as a somewhat gripping tale of revenge that is never exploitative nor dunderheaded, and indeed remains constantly engrossing to its affecting finale.Penn's film is an engrossing low-key drama observing some rather high-key feelings of consciousness, a film with a creative and personal stamp all over it; principally, a film which looks at those on opposite sides of the death of a young girl at the hands of a drunk-driving incident and revolves a subversive nucleus around a number of sub-plots contributing to an overall thesis. One of these individuals is Jack Nicholson's Freddy Gale; a man, whose daughter is Emily and who was killed in that driving incident five years ago, whom is initially revealed as someone combating whatever grief he experiences by frequenting strip clubs so as to meet with his equally sleazy colleagues and which usually leads to the spending of a night with one of the performers. Freddy is the guy we're inclined towards siding with out of victimisation, but he is, in actual fact, a sleazy and unlikeable individual; with the perpetrator of the death coming across as a little bit more than the faceless, drink driving murderer we're, again, naturally inclined towards labelling as such.It's not as if we feel Freddy doesn't care, indeed he has the anniversary of his daughter's death vehemently stencilled in on his calender; while his clinicalness is exemplified in his dealing with a minute employee issue early on at his jewellers in an effective and shrewed manner. Freddy's lifestyle acts as something to sooth the pain, since his ex-wife, in Anjelica Huston's Mary, is seen during that opening therapy session born out of Emily's death; Penn cutting back and forth from such sequences at such places juxtaposing the content and alluding to a harsh duality in dealing with grief. The turntable which will unsettle the balance in each of these people's lives arrives in the form of David Morse's John Booth, the man who was responsible for Emily's death and is now out of prison after his stretch for it. You always feel that a genre piece would demand a man of such a nature be collected by a former criminal cohort or something in the region of; here, Booth is picked up by his parents, and he appears humble enough - speaking of the problems he experienced whilst incarcerated and appearing to have a good rapport with his folks. Indeed, his parents seem like gentle folk and still connect with each other at the age they're at, a far cry from Freddy and Mary on the other strand who're a lot younger but much further apart.Freddy, blinded by some vengeful rage, as well as the seemingly still prominent escalating need to prove his masculinity following the decimation of his marriage, and after so much time spent with women and in those specific locales with other men, tracks Booth with the intent to kill him. The men reach a compromise that sees Booth suggest he come back to his trailer-home in three days time to challenge him if he still wants blood to be spilt. Interestingly, this causes Freddy to go home and make an even larger stencil mark on his calender than that of the anniversary's date; an alluding to the hierarchical element to which date, as well as the actions predestined to be either acknowledged or carried out on such dates, acts as more important to him. Penn's film is one of a revenge ilk in which a lead reckons to grab the nearest firearm and hulk out to get some revenge so as to compensate for a lost or taken loved one; its substance in identifying that as a premise commonly used to drive such films as Commando or Rambo III, and allowing that respective denouement to occur in the first third, crucial to permitting the involved parties to play out what is from there on in an engrossing mediation on revenge; grief and guilt which ought not slip beneath one's radar.

Let's begin with the title. It was never explained why it was called The Crossing Guard. Normally the title is used in films or it will express the overall emotion or theme of the film. In Penn's ditty, it did neither. There was even an embarrassing scene when Nicholson is driving by a crossing guard giving him a look going very slowly (in slo-motion) trying to build an emotional scene. The scene made no sense. This will lead me to the next complaint. There was no consistency with this film. The characters were so underdeveloped that you really never had an idea what they wanted from this film or why they wanted to do this film. It felt like Nicholson was just repaying a favor for Penn. This was Nicholson's token must cry movie. I still have no clue why Anjelica Houston's character was so frigid. I did not understand any of these characters in this film. It was as if I never got to know them, yet somehow had to watch their life. Speaking of consistency, it would have been great to have some back-story in this film. I thought that it started decently, but I would have liked to see what this family was like prior to the accident. I could have used a strong point-counterpoint. If the family were happy, going to the beach, in constant sunlight prior to the accident, then it would have provided a great start to the downfall after the accident. I would have also liked to see the relationship between Freddy and his daughter prior to the accident; it would have shed some better light as to why he was so avid on revenge and why Mary was easily able to put it behind her. Again, more consistency would have helped hold this film together easier. Also, there really wasn't a story either. Using the rule of following a plot from point A to B to C, this film created the sense that I had jumped exactly at the B part. There was no A, half of the B was missing, and we were headed straight towards the C. That confused me greatly. I have read some reviews for this film that have praised what Penn has done to this film and story. I have no clue if these critics have seen the same film or not. Overall, this film was a jumbled mess of horror. It reminded me of walking into a child's room looking on the floor and seeing all sorts of toys, games, clothes, and stuffed animals just lying on the floor.

The driver (David Morse) is just now getting out of prison, and Nicholson has sworn that he will kill the man. That's pretty much the entire set-up. There really isn't much plot to the film - it's just a contemplative look at two lost souls as they struggle to get on with their lives. Many seem to find it boring. I thought it was quite powerful, though it doesn't work 100% of the time. Nicholson's performance is uneven - he has a lot of good to great scenes, but there are times when he overacts, as well. Morse is the stronger of the two main performers - he's absolutely outstanding. Anjelica Huston is also strong as Nicholson's ex-wife - she's dealt with her pain much more healthily than Nicholson has, and she tries to talk him out of it (notably, though, she never informs the police of his plans, though, frankly, from what I know of her character I don't find it believable that she wouldn't). Huston was nominated for Best Supporting Actress at the Golden Globes. Robin Wright (before she hyphenated her last name) also co-stars as Morse's love interest. She doesn't have much to do, but she does do a sexy dance to Salt 'n Pepa's Whatta Man. Penn's direction is quite great, as is the editing. It is a little slow, and there are a few bits that don't work (most involve Nicholson overacting), but I really liked it.

It's possibly the 2nd or 3rd worst movie I've seen. In addition, I believe this is one picture they inserted profanity to force an 'R' rating. I can see no other reason for it.

I really think very highly of Sean Penn, he is my favorite actor but as a director he simply sucks! This movie is so bad I kept rubbing my eyes not wanting to believe all the cliques he kept bringing on. Parents losing their child, father seeking revenge...hello we have seen all that, the prisoner coming out in a pathetic way, being all good and soft.  Must say that Nicholson and Houston were way too old for being parents to those little kids (I kept asking myself what was she...55 when she gave birth or what?!). I also never quite understood what the role of Mr.Penn's wife in this movie was. Ah, the sex scene probably. Otherwise the whole relationship they managed to establish in just one day is so improbable it hurts your feelings.  I read about the final scene...just what I expected (and feared). Luckily I fell asleep somewhere near the end when the revenger and the victim were running to the graveyard (the climax or something) and was spared the sugar boosting ending.  Great actors really wasted their talent in this movie.3/10 and I am being generous.

Basically Freddy Gale (Jack Nicholson) has waited for six for the man responsible for killing his daughter in a hit and run, John Booth (David Morse), to be released from prison, and that day has come. The day of his release, Gale goes to see a changed and regretful Booth, and he announces that he will kill him in one week. In this time, Booth uses the time to make peace with himself and have a relationship, while Gale spirals to the edge of sanity with his obsessive hatred for Booth. So the end of the week comes, and Gale is ready with a gun to kill Booth, but when it actually comes to it, Gale is really struggling to do what he has wanted to do all those years. Also starring Golden Globe nominated Anjelica Huston as Mary, Robin Wright Penn as Jojo, Piper Laurie as Helen Booth, Richard Bradford as Stuart Booth, Priscilla Barnes as Verna, Robbie Robertson as Roger, Kellita Smith as Tanya, John Savage as Bobby, Kari Wuhrer as Mia, Joe Viterelli as Joe and Dr. William Dignam as The Crossing Guard (of the title). Nicholson is not as showy as he usually is, Morse makes a pretty fine performance as the near sympathetic ex-criminal, and the story has an intelligent enough script that you can forgive the slow-burning pace, it is a drama to care about. Good! "}]
