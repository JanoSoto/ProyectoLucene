Sylvester  Stallone looks sleepy, at one time they show a close-up of his eyes and  Julianne Moore's eyes.  You can see the difference so easily.  Banderas is  alive, which is good.  The best performance is probably from Julianne Moore  who is the girl they have to get the disk from.  Special effects are good,  as is the ending climax.

Ironically enough in the advent of John Woo (his american popularity and his imitators) as well as Micheal Bay, Tony Scott, and Jerry Brukhiemer, it is rephreshing to see an action movie, a shoot-out action movie, where the emphasis is on efficiency and control rather than chaos.  Unlike the John Woo pilosophy of keeping the guns firing non stop even if they hit nothing, Assassins works on the exact opposite theory of every shot has a purpose and a meaning and no shot is taken wildly even to distract (add on to the fact that in most John Woo movies, and especially  Michael Bay movies, the guns are super loud, whereas in Assassins, pretty much every shot thats fired is silenced). I beleive there is only one instance in the film where shots are fired wildly wnd wrecklessly, and that is during the apartment scene where Antonio Banderas' character. Micheal Bein, shoots blindly through a wall at Slyvester Stallone's character, Robert Rath.  Other than that, there is not really anytype of panic fire or wild bullet spraying (in fact I dont beleive this film even features automatic rifles of any kind).  Strangely enough, this allows for events that move extremly quick example, the first scene featuring the three title characters in the hotel.  We see Antonio Banderas, in the blink of an eye alomst, take out 3 guards, walkinto the room they were guarding and then take out the 4 targets in that room in the same amount of time.  In a way, it is very similar to the old Samurai films since their action scenes moved in a similar manner with nothingn then all of a sudden a few quick sword strikes and the conflict is over.  That being said, this movie would require a certain type of taste in action movies or is a type of movie you have to be in the mood to watch.sidenote When I first watched this film, I had no idea it featured the would be superstar Antonio Banderas, nor that it was written by the soon to be Matrix creators.  In that sense it is almost a fun movie to watch because it kinda answers the question what did they do before they were famous? and now you know.

In this story Robert is starting to grow a soft spot and only kills the person he was hired to kill...leaving innocents out of it. While Miguel was ready to shoot a 7-year old soccer player to get what he wanted. Banderas plays this part well. I dunno if any of you caught this but when Banderas is handling a gun he does alot of the same things in movie. Scenes from the movie Desperado started to flash in my head when I saw Banderas and Stallone duking it out at the cemetary. Robert is then hired to hit a mark, which is a woman who is only known by a pair of cat eyes, to retrieve a disc, and also kill the buyers. Miguel is also hired for the same job causing a little game between the 2 hitmen. Ofcourse Robert can't come around to killing Electra (Julianne Moore), so he instead protects her and later teams up with her for some more delightfully planned out fun.

He took on a cocky but ambitious young man, Steve McKenna, played by Jan-Michael Vincent, to be his prot√©g√©. The latter turned the table on the master.In this movie, 'Assassins', Sylvester Stallone played the lead role of a veteran contract hit-man, Robert Bath, who apparently was number one in the business. A cocky, but ambitious young hit-man, Miguel Bain, played by Antonio Banderas, came into the scene with the fatalistic idea of becoming the number one.Intertwined in their personal conflict of hierarchy, appeared a woman computer hacker, Electra, played by Julianne Moore, as well as a mysterious employer, Nikolai Taslinkov, who seemingly was connected to all the three key characters in the movie.For the rest of the movie, it was an exciting cat & mouse game between Bath & Bain, with Electra eventually teaming up with Bath to elude from & deal with Bain. The action sequences throughout the movie, especially the shoot-out inside a hotel in the first half & the shoot-out in an abandoned building (in Mexico) towards the end, were really good.It was quite fun to watch Antonio Banderas playing the hot-headed, crazy guy. He was really good, as good as Sylvester Stallone, who, as typical & in most of his movies of this genre (Nighthawks, Cobra, Judge Dredd, Demolition Man...), played the cool, confident character...maybe, a little stiff in some way. Julianne Moore, a very accomplished British actress, unfortunately had an understated role, although she did her best.On the whole, 'Assassins' has been an entertaining - never a dull moment - action movie to watch...especially when you can watch two assassins for the price of one!

Antonio Banderas plays his young rival and Julianne Moore a computer whiz with whom Rath teams up. Anatoli Davydov is also on hand.At a 132 minutes, Assassins is too long for what it is &#x96; a wall-to-wall action movie where someone gets shot every 1-2 minutes, at least during the numerous ultra-violent sequences. This would be alright if the story and characters were interesting enough to warrant such length, but they're not. Banderas shines in the role of Bain, the zealous murderous psycho, but being a murderous psycho means he will get no sympathy from the viewer, otherwise he wouldn't be a murderous psycho. The characters played by Stallone and Moore are more sympathetic, but there's not enough detail to really care about them. Beyond that, the plot is convoluted even while the film is snappy. Despite the thrills, the story's just not engrossing enough to give a higher grade, but it's nowhere near as bad in this regard as, say, The Mummy Returns. In other words, Assassins moderately keeps your attention.And then there's the pile-up of implausibilities that are too easy to spot, like how does Bain not get seriously wounded by a bus while hanging out the window of a taxi? How does he emerge virtually unscathed from a fall from a third-story window after a great explosion? Even if the table protected his head and mid-section, what about his fingers and legs that weren't protected? How did he NOT break something from the awkward fall? Why does Rath blow valuable seconds looking for a dumpster to throw a suitcase with a ticking bomb? If you knew a sniper was waiting for you outside a bank, wouldn't you use the back door and then maybe surprise the assassin from behind? If someone pulls a gun on you, like at the end with Bain and Rath, wouldn't you automatically shoot first and ask questions later? Lastly, the whole set-up at the end with one character waiting in the bank, another as a sniper in an abandoned hotel, and the other outside informing the one in the bank is the height of contrived.I realize implausible and contrived things happen in all action flicks, but the really good ones are able to get away with it because the filmmakers take the extra time to work out the kinks and make a truly compelling picture, like Terminator 2, and not merely string together a bunch of exciting action scenes with contrivances galore. Still, Assassins is worth checking out if you like the cast and are in the mood for a polished action/thriller.The film was shot in Seattle & Everett, Washington, Portland, Oregon, and San Juan, Puerto Rico.GRADE C+ "},{"Title":"The film is very good","Date":"29 January 2002","Score":"6 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":"  I Enjoyed the film very much and i would watch it again , it is an good action film and stallone plays his part very well.

It's so bad, that almost every scene should be torn apart for its stupidity, yet the whole movie doesn't deserve 50 words of a review.The story is much more simple, than it pretends to be. Two assassins are given the very same task by some mysterious employer. One of the killers suffers from an old veteran willing to retire clich√©. The other hit-man however is a young, flamboyant rookie (doesn't this characterization recall a much better movie directed by Donner - Lethal Weapon?) Needless to say, those cardboard characters are gonna clash more than once and I'm sure you're dying to find out the final result.The horrible script (filled with more then standard amount of clich√©s, plot holes, logical flaws and contempt for laws of physics) has pretty much given up any attempt at credibility in the first half an hour. The evil hit-man (Banderas) escapes arresting by police. He can be hiding anywhere. Yet our hero assassin (Stallone) only needs to steal a cab and wait for a passenger willing to reach an airport - miraculously he turns out to be Banderas. Coincidence of such proportions wouldn't a five-year-old, but it's good enough for those allegedly adult writers of AssassinsWho, one may ask, is given the questionable credit for writing this nonsense? Two names shouldn't come as a surprise - Andy and Larry Wachowski, two of the biggest hacks of modern cinema. After getting way too much praise for Matrix, they thought every junk they produce, will spawn a similar religious following. It seems they were terrible writers before 1999, just not as self-indulgent.A bit more surprising is the third name in the bunch - Brian Helgeland, the Academy Award winner for L.A. Confidential. It's up to debate, how great the script for Curtis Hanson's noir film really was. Surely, a work of genius compared to Assassins, though a rest of his career wouldn't prove such quality.Obviously, a script this bad is still a pile of paper, which should never be brought to life. Who takes responsibility here? Surprisingly again, a few acclaimed names and (with exception of miscast Julianne Moore) experienced in making action films. Should we praise Stallone, Banderas or Donner for their mild competence? Or maybe we should mock them for embarrassing themselves. I didn't find their effort as a saving grace of this film, as much as a fall from grace for them.To conclude, this way too long review - Assassins is an awful movie, which asks to be annihilated. Luckily, to accomplish this mission, you don't need to hire one or two killers. All you have to do is change the channel.

The action sequences are excellently handled, highly realistic and at the same time very exciting, and the various special effects and stunts are inserted perfectly into the flow of things.Meanwhile the scenes of suspense between the action are full of very real danger, so despite the long running time you never find your attention wavering. Cast in the flawed hero mould is endlessly-criticised Sylvestor Stallone, putting in a nicely subtle performance and letting his nemesis, Antonio Banderas, do all of the (over)acting as psychotic but deadly assassin Miguel Bain. Holding the movie together is a low-key and sweet Julianne Moore, as a surveillance expert who finds herself over her head and in the middle of a violent battle to the death between two expert marksmen. The only problem I have with a film like this is that all other action movies don't possess the same level of commitment, grace, and intelligence as this one does.

Now a younger assassin, Miguel (Antonio Banderas) has appeared and he wants Robert's position. This movie is an action movie and is quite good. Donner creates a very dreamlike feel to the movie, which possibly means that what we have is not always going to be there. Personally that is just a wild guess. The bigger theme in the movie is the fear that somebody younger will appear that is much better than you and thus making you obsolete. The world in the movie is one of assassins, but this is very much true in the business world where the older people have to keep on their toes with the younger executives who want their job. Then there are the conservative established companies who are being challenged by the new innovative companies. Assassins portrays life, a life where we must watch out for the ambitious coming up from below us and remain alert as they attempt to take from us the position that they want. Yet there is also a time when we want to retire, when we wish to give up, and the thing assassins says is that we can never retire because even if we give up the race, the race always seeks to come along and forcefully remove us. Assassins is done in a dreamlike state because it is a reflection of the world in which we live.

As you'd expect, the fun is in their contrasting styles - Stallone the world-weary professional, Banderas the brash younger upstart - with both actors really getting the most out of these admittedly stereotypical roles. Julianne Moore makes a great love interest, playing a nerd (hey, this IS fiction) who gets herself in trouble by hacking the wrong secrets to the wrong people.The story builds through some nice set-piece stand-offs between Stallone and Banderas, and climaxes with a sweaty showdown almost worthy of a Sergio Leone or Sam Peckinpah. True, Richard Donner lacks the style of those great directors, but it's that kind of situation, and Donner milks it for all its delicious tension, through to the satisfying if not entirely surprising resolution.Sure, Assassins isn't exactly cinema at its finest. But it delivers what it promises some clever action that, for once, takes the time to evolve from the characters - no doubt courtesy of the Wachowski Brothers' above-average script. I'd put Assassins right up alongside some of Stallone's other under-rated action flicks - well ahead of simpler films like The Specialist and Cliffhanger, and even smidgen ahead of the more robust Daylight.Don't go in expecting Citizen Kane, and you should have have a grin-inducing good time with this one.

I love ASSASSINS! I can watch it over and over. The tone, pace, and style of the film perfectly fits Stallone's stoic, glaring, steely demeanor. And Stallone is damn freakin good in this film! It's one of his better film performances. Stallone plays Robert Rath (cool name), a veteran highly paid assassin who will only assassinate high-level shady criminals (nicknamed marks). He has morals of course, as noted early in the film. But Rath wants out. He's tired of killing for a living, so he wants to do one last job, assassinating a reclusive billionaire mark named Alan Branch, who financed South American death squads.But there's a complication. Rath finds that he's no longer alone. A cocksure, boisterous young gun named Miguel Bain (played with vim, vigor, and verve by Antonio Banderas). Bain kills Branch at his brother's funeral (where Rath was going to kill him), then the fun begins! Rath tracks down Bain and tries to eliminate him, but to no avail. Bain escapes and so Rath wants to know from his secret employer who this kid is. So Rath agrees to do one last job (this time he's serious; it pays 2 million dollars) to retrieve a disc with encrypted information and kill the buyers and the seller (the mark). The buyers are Interpol agents trying to capture Rath and Bain's secret employer. The mark (who intercepted the transmission) is a hot, slightly skewered-in-the-brain redheaded genius named Elektra and she is played by then newcomer and now top Hollywood actress Julianne Moore. I've never seen Moore's big time Oscar-nominated movies (except BOOGIE NIGHTS), but I've seen her in a lot of other stuff and this is my favorite thing she's done.As Rath is about to complete this 'final' mission, Bain steps in again and kills the buyers while Rath gets to Electra first before she turns over the disk information, but decides not to kill her since Bain has interceded again and he wants to stop this kid and deal with his employer for hiring him by extorting for 20 million dollars for his trouble. It is during this time that Rath and Electra develop a connection and become partners to stop Bain from repeating history (Rath killed the #1 assassin 15 years before to be #1; now Bain wants to kill Rath so he can become #1). Stallone, Banderas, and Moore are all excellent and keep the action lively and moving. I like the way the film shows how these highly trained professionals plot, scheme, think, and outwit their way through sticky and tricky situations. The action is spare, yet exciting when it comes and the film is an very interesting character study. It never slows down or drags at all, even though the pace is delibarate. The final showdown is thrilling to say the least. Well done all the way around!

Despite it having its moments and some impressive set pieces It feels overly long and slow. It has a few it holes, and the number one Hit-man in the world is a pretty poor shot when it comes to killing the number 2 Hit-man in the world, as is the number two, when it comes to taking down the number one.

Rath teams up with a computer hacker named Electra to defeat the obsessed Bain.....Its by the numbers stuff, but anyone who is expecting an all out action ride will be sorely disappointed by the overall movie. It's more of a thriller, even a drama, more than anything. And like the titular characters,the film is all about waiting for the payoff, waiting for the right moment.Its one of those movies in Stallones career that has been unfairly forgotten about, and was ignored on its initial release. I can understand why it didn't do very well, it was released a few months after Judge Dredd, and this was a time when people went to see movies based on star power, and Stallones star was rapidly fading after his brief comeback with Cliffhanger.Plus, it doesn't help that Banderas steals absolutely every scene he's in. Maniacal, unhinged, and downright brilliant, his Bain is the highlight of the movie, from his body language to his grandiose way with the script, its one of his finest performances.When the action is there, it's pretty spectacular. From the initial meet up in the taxi, to the raid on Electras apartment, Silver spares no expense with the action, and the pyrotechnics.Moore is good, but she's just filler for the decidedly thin plot, but it looks good, even though it's aged terribly (Stallones E-mails are hilarious), and Stallones wardrobe leaves a lot to be desired, Donner has crafted a neat little movie.It's just a shame it's not more widely seen.

When he loses out on payment for his last contract when an unknown rival Miguel Bain (Antonio Banderas)takes out his contract before he had the chance, Rath agrees to take on another job on 4 Dutch Buyers who are intent on buying a disc from Electra (Julianne Moore) who is the mark who Rath has been assigned to kill. The trouble is that there is no intel on Electra making it tricky for Rath to find her. By the time, Rath does find her, Bain is already on the scene, but Bain locates the buyers rather than the mark. Rath then tricks Bain into thinking that he has killed Electra. Rath soon begins to realise that the Contractor is playing both himself and Bain off against each other and tries to find out who's doing it and why whilst also trying to stay one step ahead of his deadly rival.When watching films, I sometimes have to say to myself 'Come on, it's only a film, don't take it so seriously' and for the most part I can suspend disbelief, but there were some things in this film that just didn't make sense....1) Bain gets arrested by the police early on, but manages to slip his cuffs and escape killing about 3 maybe 4 police officers in the process. Due to the nature of his escape and due to the fact that he killed a few officers made me think to myself 'Wow!! Bain will end up being one of the most wanted men in the city', but after the early police presence we see no police officers pursuing either Rath or Bain that in spite of the number of people Bain kills throughout the film. It just wasn't believable.2) We also are expected to accept that Bain has a skeleton made of steel - he gets crushed between a car and a bus (whilst they're both moving) and also gets blown out of a third floor window. On both occasions, he seems to suffer no 'ill effects' - it's an action thriller so I can probably let this one slide, but it still kind of annoys me.3)In the closing stages of the film, it's revealed that the 'Contractor' was the guy who Rath was ordered to kill 15 years ago. Rath believed that the 'Contractor' was dead, but Rath fired at the Contractor's heart and the 'Contractor' had some sort of prosthetic shell covering his heart due to the fact that he knew Rath would aim for his heart. This was quite a nice twist and it explains why he targeted and set up Rath, but why was he stringing Bain along? It's possible that the 'Contractor' may have played Rath and Bain off against each other purely for his own amusement and in order for Rath to prove that he truly is the best, but this is unclear.All in all, if you take this film as it is then it is an entertaining and fairly decent thriller. Considering it's 130 minutes long, it actually moves at a reasonably good pace with only the odd sag here and there. Despite my gripes above, I did enjoy the film and would say that it's worth a look.

It's not the sort of the film that troubles award committees or quickens the heart-rate of critics. But audiences lap these sort of films up and especially guys who enjoy explosions and gun fights and various macho activities. Which I do but this effort never really steps it up and seems perfectly happy to remain in third gear without getting anywhere near top speed.Professional hit-man Robert Rath (Stallone) is looking to get out of the game as age starts to catch up with him. After he misses out on a contract thanks to rival Miguel Bain (Antonio Banderas), Rath is offered a shot at $2 million. The target is an anonymous electronics whiz (Julianne Moore) who's trying to arrange a deal with some shady Dutch types in Seattle. But Bain is never far behind and as Rath begins to question his orders, both of their lives are in danger.Stallone, looking much younger on the film's poster than he does in the movie, is a strangely monotone hero (if you can call someone who kills or money a hero) and at no point do you feel, support or root for him. Banderas is much more engaging but this is because he's an evil equivalent of El Mariachi from Desperado. Gun in each hand and hair in front of his face, you know the look. Anyway, the pair of them tear through the scenery with plenty of gusto and the action is satisfying enough even if it is a little old-school. The plot is pretty formulaic and predictable - in fact, the only real surprise is the lack of a sex scene. So far, so what? It couldn't be any more average if it wanted to be but Assassins does have a couple of interesting trivia points. The script, written and then disowned by the Wachowski brothers (creators of the first 21st century action movie The Matrix), isn't as bad as they reckon but it doesn't offer anything new or different. The director, Richard Donner, knows his stuff when it comes to the action genre but it doesn't feel like a quality product - all the guns sound silenced for some reason and there is an explosion which is badly imposed on the footage and gives the sense of a budget being ran dry. I also can't figure out why they paid Stallone such a vast sum of money for his performance because for $15 million, I'd at least expect a flicker of emotion or some facial movement. But the only things that move on Stallone's head are his eyes and lips and personally, I wonder if the Wachowski's disowned the script after they'd seen the movie.

Sullen, monosyllabic one-dimensional Stallone becomes a little tiresome as movie lead. But - I got a surprise.Stallone plays a hit-man. He's the maestro. Long in the business and meticulously careful, with a low profile. But he's had about enough and wants out. His contracts come via the internet (that's not something you could do post 9/11). At his next hit, he finds himself upstaged by another killer, played by Antonio Banderas. He's also extremely good at killing, but he's halfway over the blue wall, slaughtering anyone who is the least inconvenience with a maniacal relish. He's the new kid on the block and wants to be No1. But it's obvious that such overt, ferocious excess couldn't possibly stand the test of time. The authorities would have to track him down. A star that burns twice as bright shines for half as long, etc.It appears that both men have been played-off by their contractor. One of Stallone's next hits is a female computer-hacker who sells secrets to foreigners - a traitor, in other words.Instead of bumping her off (he's an unemancipated sucker, you see) he decides to defend her from his heir-presumptive firebrand who is likewise after her scalp. What follows then often resembles 'The Terminator', where hero Kyle Reece tries to keep Sarah Connor safe from the relentless cyborg. Though there are other plot threads too.I found this a thoroughly entertaining romp. It far exceeded my expectations. Sly's sluggish demeanour is well suited to the quiet, calculating character he plays. Whilst Antonio Banderas has played the manic pistolero often enough to know the score. All the players give a decent turn for their paycheques. When the action comes - it comes plentiful and fast. Meanwhile the corpses accumulate. But it's not all road-rage and shoot-'em-up. There are plenty of mood moments and lots of clever original plot details. I particularly like the exchanges of money and goods by means of a radio-controlled model truck via the hotel ventilation ducts.All of the technical issues like lighting and editing are on the mark. The soundtrack and incidental music are interesting and well-chosen. I was only a little disappointed by the ending. This movie has far more to engage the viewer than Tom Cruise's verbose and rather over-blown 'Collateral' (which also features a hero protecting some female from Cruise's brutal assassin).

He never looks bad on screen (even in Copland he is captivating as a deeply scared and mostly silent sheriff). I was also raised on the high octane action thrillers of producer Joel Silver and direct Richard Donner. My teen years were gung ho and visceral in terms of film going.Something drab happened in the 1990's though. Mood was mistaken for entertainment instead of mise en scene. And as a result a clutch of thrillers simply did not work. The Assassin (Point Of No Return) the remake of the French Nikita was slow and despite having Bridget Fonda and Gabrielle Byrne it lacked edge, and John Badham's use of slo-mo worked against the films action instead of for it. Then came Stallone's own tepid simmer (hardly thriller) with Sharon Stone - The Specialist. This is best remembered for two things 1) the hilarious sex scene between the He-Man Stallone and the Barbie Stone (really funny for how awful it is); 2) the ubiquitous scene-chewing James Woods who has a ball as the bad-guy, in this laughable and yet boring fiasco. Always suspect in any film is a voice over - like they forget something and had to make sense of it (Re the ill-advised Bladerunner VO), only here it is the terrible and completely unbelievable telephone calls between Stone and Stallone that play over otherwise banal surveillance shots of Stallone stalking the Colombian mafia on Stone's behalf. The whole films might have worked better without the calls. Oh well.And then came Assassins. Admittedly a step up from The Specialist, but not far. Julianne Moore's character comes over as a completely asynchronous character as she is not clever (which she is supposed to be), but is too old to be as ditsy as she plays it. Stallone does have more action to play with and the film's flaws are not his fault. The problem comes in the last half of the film when the pace is slowed so much it feels like it will never end. The problem is that the first half has a fair amount of action in it, whereas the last half is a tense setup. This simply does not work as we feel let down by the lack of action. A film tilted the other way might work more, but it's never going to work as a tense ending when the heartbeat in the first half was quite simply beating faster. The result, although competently directed, is an uneven film which ultimately lets you down.I would really like Stallone to do another Specialist/Assassin film today, where he comes out of retirement for something personal (I know that's the story of Rocky Balboa/Rambo IV, but if it ain't broke...). I think he could redeem himself of these studio blips (I see big thumb prints all over these pictures), so long as he wrote and directed the film himself. Stallone is a very good actor who has been caught in a niche market (despite trying to break free of it) for three decades. He is also a good writer and director. If he took some time over this one it could be another hit for the iconic star.Please redeem yourself Sly. I shall wait with baited breath.

In a movie where much of the killing is done by silenced long-range shots, the two adversaries Rath and Bain, often finds themselves close together, in a situation where violence is impossible. The confrontation is then more verbal, and I got a deeper understanding of the conflict than if they just were to shoot at each other. I think that made the movie both a little different from others and better. Of course there are enough scenes with shooting and explosions and so forth as well. The cast is good, Stallone is typical Stallone, maybe a little stiff. Moore is good as well but best of the three is Banderas as Bain.

He was, of course, referring to El Dorado which although it is not officially a remake of Rio Bravo shares with it a very similar plot and the same leading man, John Wayne. Hawks and Wayne were later to make the same film for a third time, this time under the title Rio Lobo.It would appear that, with six Rockies and four Rambos under his belt, Sylvester Stallone also enjoys making the same film several times. His 1994 outing, The Specialist, never generated a franchise in this way, possibly because it was given a deservedly hostile reception by the critics. He did, however, follow it up the following year with the very similar Assassins which can be regarded as an unacknowledged remake.In both films Stallone plays hit-men who earn their living by murdering people, the main difference that Ray Quick from The Specialist prefers to use explosives, whereas Robert Rath, Sly's character here, uses a gun as his weapon of choice. Now you might think that this would make them the villains of the piece, but both are in fact treated as the heroes of their respective films. Hollywood has often tended to romanticise professional assassins, the more recent Bradgelina love-fest Mr. and Mrs Smith being a good example, and Messrs Quick and Rath can both be regarded as Good Murderers to whom falls the task of protecting the innocent from Bad Murderers. (In between The Specialist and Assassins, Sly had made Judge Dredd, in which he plays another type of Good Murderer).In Assassins the Bad Murderer is Miguel Bain, a rival hit-man even more ruthless than Rath himself. When Rath discovers that both he and Bain have been assigned by their contractor to kill the same mark, a computer hacker named Electra, he has a change of heart and decides to protect her from Bain. Similarly in The Specialist Stallone found himself trying to protect an attractive girl, played there by Sharon Stone, from the attentions of another Bad Murderer (James Woods).Despite Rath's change of heart, the difference between him and Bain, as far as their code of ethics is concerned, is really only paper-thin. Perhaps it was for this reason that Stallone and Antonio Banderas, who plays Bain, decided to make their characters as different as possible in terms of styles of acting. Banderas plays Bain as an aggressive, cocky and hyper-active loudmouth, the sort of man the audience would loathe even if he were not a vicious killer. Rath, by contrast, is quiet, reserved and stony-faced. Rath's main motivation is financial, whereas Bain is obsessed with the psychological need to prove himself a better assassin than the older, more experienced Rath. (The idea of crime as a competitive sport is a common one in the cinema, another example being Ocean's Twelve which features a criminal whose motive for committing crimes is the desire to prove himself the best thief in the world).This film is more evidence that Julianne Moore's career has been a rather chequered one. (She plays Electra here). Although she has starred in excellent films like Far from Heaven or The Hours, she has also acted in her fair share of rubbish, examples being Body of Evidence and the dreadful Gus van Sant remake of Hitchcock's Psycho, both of them even worse films than this one.Assassins is not a truly appalling film like either of those two examples; Richard Donner, who made The Omen, the original Superman and the Lethal Weapon series is a competent director of action movies, and at a basic technical level is not a bad film. My overall, view, however, would be similar to my opinion of The Specialist, namely that it is an uninspired, routine thriller marred by a misguided attempt to glorify a murderer by turning him into a hero. 4/10 "},{"Title":"Very swift, and promising!","Date":"14 June 2006","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" Movies about hired guns will come and go once in a while, with the movie Assassins this movie is like a roller-coaster ride, only deadlier. With one hired gun, who needs an upstart, who's a total hothead. Sly Stallone plays Robert Rath, a veteran killer who meets his match, a young upstart named Miguel Bain(Antonio Banderas) who kills one of the few crime families at a funeral, then makes his escape while being handcuffed by the police. He dislocated his thumb to slip through the cuffs, and snaps the officer's neck in the process. Robert has the scanner which makes himself more efficient. Bain is so dangerous, he kills anyone who got in his way. It was downright barbaric to tamper with the fireplace to kill that young lady, and follow her every move. I liked the part where both men realize that the man Rath thought has killed, was still breathing. And Bain who tried to shoot Rath confronts him in the bank to have a little chat with him. Why blow the chance and do it already? Maybe he had a another plan if the first one backfires. To me, his assassination of Rath was stalled out for too long. Bain may have had youth, but Rath had more tricks up his sleeve, or tucked in his belt. This movie in my opinion is great, plenty of cunningness, and the plot was played out very well. This is one of Stallone's finest movies. Rating 3 out of 5 stars.

It's from Arabic and was used to refer to a tribe of murderers who wrecked themselves on hashish before doing the dirty deed. Well, they may have used it, but not while murdering anyone. Hash is much too mellow a high. Which is something that can't be said about this movie. You may or may not know it but you've seen this movie before. Think back to the last dozen or so action movies you've watched, pick out the typical characters and set pieces, put them together in a slightly different order or locale, and you have Assassins. You will need a high-speed car chase, exploding fireballs, pistols with silencers, a sniper's scoped rifle, a sinister villain with greasy and unkempt hair, the supposedly dead body that has just been shot and fallen through four floors and suddenly comes rip-roaring back to life, bodies crashing through windows in slow motion, guns that never need reloading, a hero rushing madly through a flock of pigeons to save his girlfriend who is in immediate jeopardy, someone hanging by the fingertips of one hand from a rickety old pipe,a hit man who wants to retire, and a plot involving a MacGuffin and a rivalry between assassins to see who is going to be the best assassin in the world, the second best, and only the third best. Put them all together and you have Assassins. The suspense associated with awaiting the outcome whipped me into a frenzy of indifference. There is one surprise, though. If Stallone managed to take off his clothes and flex his pecs again I managed to miss it, thank God. His muscles have acquired such bulk that his sports jackets look made by Adrian. If his shoulders get any wider he'll look like Joan Crawford in some 1944 movie. It's hard to tell from this movie that Julianne Moore is really an actress with some range. Nothing much is asked of her here except to be the helpless, trapped female, but see her as a vacant personality in Safe, in which she turns in an excellent, subdued performance. She isn't stunningly pretty and she doesn't ooze sex and collagen, but she has the kind of ordinary good looks that might draw glances in a supermarket. She needs a vehicle.

Just when Stallone's about to assassinate him at a funeral, a competing assassin, Banderas, appears, and takes the contract. Stallone knows that he is being targeted, so on his next assignment, which is Moore and the disk, he reneges when Banderas again appears.Well-staged chases and close escapes ensue, in several locations. We also are treated to love developing between Stallone and Moore, who are initially antagonists. Donner's sure directing hand gives us a smooth result. Stallone and Moore stand out. Banderas' character is a clich√©, namely, a competitive, hot-tempered, macho Latin man who wants to be number one. Each sequence in the movie is well-developed, especially the climactic scenes on a Caribbean island that involve a deteriorating hotel. The script develops character mainly through action and plot development, so that it engages viewers.A good show overall that made me realize that assassins are vulnerable to being assassinated because they know where the bodies are. The only way to prevent the threat of himself being killed is not to know who or where the orders come from. Stallone has that arrangement, and even that turns out to be dangerous.

What stuck out in my mind was a performance by Antonio Banderes that was so memorable I had to go back and re-watch this in its entirety very recently. Unlike many of the other viewers who posted here, I thought Julianne Moore was terrible in this film. The character was bad enough, but Julianne Moore's interpretation of the script made this aspect of the film practically unbearable. She was the most annoying and dumb woman who could possibly be in any film. Not to mention, she was an insulting mockery of Seattle women by making it seem people from Seattle could actually be like her. Her sense of style was absurd, and that little raincoat was a joke. As if everyone in Seattle wears these ugly little raincoats. I've not been very impressed with Julianne Moore anyway. I'm sure she's a very nice person off the screen, but she just seems like a flavor of the month actress, which is probably why we aren't seeing too many hits featuring her lately.The plot is not completely innovative or complex but it's satisfactory. Unfortunately, the film is riddled with unrealistic moments that resemble the old Tom and Jerry cartoons where everyone gets smashed up but they still survive.Banderes is what makes this movie worth watching. When I saw this movie, I took on a new opinion of his abilities. His high strung personality along with the constant swearing under breath and emotional disruptions really made his character interesting to watch.

Apparently the lead role was written for Sean Connery but he couldn't make it while both Michael Douglas & Arnold Schwarzenegger were also considered before it went to Stallone who after just making Jugde Dredd (1995) didn't need another big flop on his hands although the reported $20,000,000 he was paid to star in Assassins probably eased the pain a bit. Woody Harrelson & Tom Cruise were consider for the role of Miguel Bain before Christian Slater was offered it but turned it down & it eventually went to Banderas. I have to say I think the acting is poor especially from the ever annoying Julianne Moore & the frankly awful Stallone.Assassins is a bland totally forgettable & unexciting supposed action thriller that succeeds as neither, at one point Julianne Moore's character Electra says 'I just want my life back' & when Assassins had finished I knew exactly how she felt...

This one is a failure, but an interesting one.Start with the idea that there are three acting styles the multilayered selfreferential, the `simplify to the archetype,' and the `saturation' or method. Take the top actors in each of these fields Julianne Moore, Stallone and Banderas respectively, put them together and watch the intergenre sparks fly.Then, go get the top new writers of situations here they chose the Wachowskis, who know how to sculpt a very, very simple, readable situation and make it appear complex. And finish it off with Helgeland who is adept at potent speeches. I can see the wheels spinning at the production office. I can see people buzzing about the new mix and how it will change the blockbuster equation like `X-men` and `Lethal Weapon.' I can imagine how comfortable each player felt because they were being asked to expand on their own worst tendencies like Mel Gibson was.It doesn't work. I think an equally radical and outrageous production/art design would have helped. The final set in Rico wasn't dimensional enough. But the key problem is with the players. One can fault Stallone, but that's not fair. I think he knows a lot about his own presence, and has some intelligent ideas about it, but is too limited an actor to do anything but grunt. Since he often goes to extremes, it hardly is noticeable that here he actually is trying to out-Dred Dred. That Wachowski depends on him for inner complexities is supposed to be part of the joke, one Donner uses a lot.One can't fault Banderas either. He is as jumpy as humanly possible in an antimacho manner. No, this time the fault is at Moore's feet. That's why I find this so amazingly interesting. She is one of the best film actresses working. She understands how to fold an explicitly false reality of the film with a real reality of comment in a private world shared between her and viewer. And she is consistently powerful enough to blow two relative amateurs like Tony and Sly off the screen. The whole enterprise depends on her holding her own, so why doesn't she? Instead, she doesn't even try and instead follows the Basinger model of `girl on the run with resourceful, lover/shooter.' I can only guess that this is because she did 5 films that year. Two of them were hard, hard work, and that follows the amazing `Vanya' of the previous year which was in preparation for very long.Too bad, too.

What a totally horrible excuse for a movie. Stallone's acting is awful as always, Banderas seems high on crack or something and is highly annoying. It's all there a lame story, thinner than cigarette paper, crappy computer 'simulations' early 80's style, a lame female villain who won't leave home without her pussycat in a cage, four Dutch bad guys (all speaking German!) wanting to buy some information on a diskette, an action for which -of course- all four have to travel across the big pond, dumb-ass police officers, unbelievable action scenes... Well I guess you get the gist of it. Only plus to me is a lot of people end up dead in this flick. Don't watch it.

There's a good reason why this film doesn't have its praises sang very often too; as it's not very good. All I wanted from this film was an entertaining action feature; and after the first sequence, which takes place in a taxi cab, I really thought I was going to get what I wanted. The first sequence is clever and thrilling; but the film just can't keep that up, as after the initial sequence it descends into tedium and despite a few worthwhile moments, it never really gets out of it. The plot follows Robert Rath; a professional hit-man who wants out. His efforts to get out, however, are thwarted by the appearance of Miguel Bain; a younger assassin who has taken it upon himself to get rid of Rath himself. We then follow the hit-man as he teams up with a woman named Electra and tries to kill the younger man before he gets it himself.The Wachowski's clearly have a flair for scripting exciting action scenes, as their later opus showed; but aside from a couple of sequences, this film doesn't feature a great deal in the way of excitement. The Wachowski's also showed with The Matrix that they can handle a complex plot...so why can't they do a very good job with the simple one in this film? Much of the plot is very routine and predictable, while the ending comes out of nowhere with a plot twist that harks back to an idea that was never really a big thing earlier on in the film. The cast is fairly strong, with action icon Sylvester Stallone going through the motions in the lead role. He is joined by a charismatic Antonio Banderas, who's not bad as his opposite number; while the talented Julianne Moore is given a role way below her later standards. There are a number of good ideas in this film, but many of them would do better if the rest of the film was good also. The good cast never really gets a chance to shine, and overall, all I can rate this film as is a shame as considering all the elements and the people involved; it could have been decent example of the genre.

I wanted to like it, I love action movies and thrillers, I like Stallone, Julianne Moore and Banderas, but I was bored to the point of tears through out. This movie is excrutiatingly s-l-o-w, and when things finally happen it's not much. For an action movie there is about two small explosions, two short gun fights....and that's it. If you decide to watch Assassins, it's boredom ahoy. "},{"Title":"Almost Stallone's True Lies...almost.","Date":"21 November 2013","Score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" What I mean by my title is that Arnold Schwarzenegger's True Lies was a feat of mastery for the action genre. It wasn't just an action film, it was an epic, masterfully created piece of work. It had a very talented director, a sweeping storyline, powerful supporting roles...everything about it worked. Assassins could have been that and in some ways it comes close. You have a legendary action director in place, the action god himself, a worthy villain, and epic storyline, exotic locales. It was a roller coaster ride for me and not just because of the action but how I felt about the film. One moment I was riveted and really enjoying it and then something would happen that would drop it down a few points for me. There was one entire character who I think was entirely mis-cast but I will get to that. The film absolutely gets better as it goes until the epic climatic finale that is truly outstanding. The story is well written and action scenes that are very nearly legendary. The shoot out in the cemetery, the car chase scene with the police and the taxi cab and the finale in the run down church are without a doubt sheer genius. So why isn't Assassins better known? I am completely biased when it comes to Sylvester Stallone. I idolize this man. When I first discovered how much I loved movies I discovered Stallone and he and I spent an inordinate amount of time together when I was a teenager. And yet I had never seen Assassins...don't even know how that happened. So I was on the edge of my seat to see this. Stallone is very good as the emotionally charged and scarred Hit-man who does what he is told in order to get his mark. He is the best of the best and an event in his past has left him deeply marked. This was a solid role for him and he does well. Many reviewers on IMDb dislike the film but most rave about the performance by Antonio Banderas. Banderas is okay in the role but I would never rave about it. I think he overplays and overdoes the role. The quirky little behaviour and obsessive tics his character has gets old quick and is more distracting than anything and makes it hard to believe his assassin is number two in the world. Stallone and Banderas have good chemistry opposite each other but its not amazing chemistry. Banderas does get significantly better (excellent actually) in the last half hour of the film when he starts to take things more seriously. And not the problem with the film. Now I have the opposite bias for Julianne Moore that I have with Stallone. I don't like her. Never have. She has chosen some good movies and she won't stop me from seeing a movie but I don't enjoy her for whatever reason. I think she is awful in this movie. The character is completely given the wrong persona and she is not believable, distracting, annoying, whiny and the romantic tension with Stallone is SOOO not necessary. Removing her from this film and making the hacker a guy would have made this film at LEAST a nine for me. The three of them simply don't mesh well together and it drags the film down. Stallone and Banderas are okay but you add Moore and the cast is sub-par at best.Richard Donner is a legend just based in my books on one film and a film series alone. That is Superman and the Lethal Weapon films. Those make him action director extraordinaire. His style and exceptional emotional range as a director does truly make this a very good watch and far from just a run and gun, shoot em up flick. It's so close to being great that it hurts. I feel like Banderas and Moore were bad casting or at least Banderas character was over-acted in the beginning. The concept is awesome. Two hit men, one young hot headed newcomer is desperate to eliminate the top hit-man in the world. It's a solid script written by those crazy Wachowski siblings of The Matrix fame proving they have more in them than just Matrix. A better supporting cast, and just a slight tightening of a few details in the script and this could have been really something. However, as it is, its still a great Stallone action flick and worth checking out for a turn off your brain, sit back and enjoy sort of flick. 7.5/10 "},{"Title":"The movie stinks","Date":"4 May 2005","Score":"2 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" This movie was a bomb to put it likely. All it seemed to focus on was Antonio Banderas idiotic, unrealistic use of two hand guns seemingly aimed at two targets at once. Those scenes have been used in some of Banderas other films such as Once upon a time in Mexico (I didn't like that movie either)and seems to be a standard with this idiot. I believed Stalone held a very good supporting role, but try as he might he couldn't put this broken movie back together again. It would seem the only thing interesting to me was the footage that was taken from the Seattle area. It is a real sorrow to see a Stalone movie flop, as I know his abilities to create a realistic and well made movie. Unfortunately working with a goof like Banderas must have been frustrating for Sylvester. This movie is best left on the video shelf to collect more dust.

This is a long, slow, boring film. Even sequences that are supposed to be exciting--such as a part where Stallone retrieves a briefcase from an elevated train in Seattle, then has to get rid of it in a hurry--are just there. There's no energy here. Sylvester Stallone does a very good job showing a hitman who's life energy has been destroyed by his career, but unfortunately his character's weariness mirrors the film's. We aren't any more enthused by what he's going through than he is.What's interesting, and a little strange, is that this movie was written by the Wachowski Brothers, who went on to write and direct THE MATRIX. The strange part is that the structure of these two movies, this one and MATRIX, isn't all that different several intense action sequences bracketed by a large amount of exposition. It's more what's done with it than what it is, though, so ASSASSINS has unexciting action with uninteresting dialogue compared to THE MATRIX.And for the goofs section, the Nicolai character says he had to fake his death in 1980 because the Cold War was coming to an end. Whatever events were happening in 1980, the Cold War's imminent end wasn't one of them.

Sly Stallone, Julianne Moore and Antonia Banderas, with hair in curls, is given an unusually poor script to work with. What is exactly going on here?There is plenty of shooting along the way with deadly results. 4 police officers succumb as well as Moore's innocent neighbor,who was in the wrong place at the wrong time. In fact, after seeing this mess of a film, most viewers will also believe that they were unfortunate to be there as well.Banderas is total wacko here and pumps bullets all over the place.

On another job Miguel also completes first, however one of the targets is a young female computer hacker who Robert decides to protect as he retires.  However Miguel wants to finish the job but also get a reputation by killing the famous Robert Rath.When this came out at the cinema (all those years ago) it had no preview tape for the magazines etc to review.  And it's clear to see why.  This film is daft and has only formulaic action scenes to save it.  The plot could have been interesting and was written by the now world famous Wachowski brothers.  However the rivalry between the old and new assassins is wasted and we are left with big dumb action scenes to fill the void.  However this are not great &#150; all OTT and lacking any form of logic at all.  It's a shame because you can see how the scenes between the two men could have been better and you wonder what the Wachowski brothers could have done with this with different actors.Stallone is a rock.  Literally he is made of Stone here and I never got a feel for his character.  On the opposite end of the scale, Banderas seems to be in a different movie and hams it up wildly &#150; although at least he's lively.  Moore is a great actress but you wouldn't know it from this &#150; she's got nothing to do and her boredom shows.Overall this has bangs and booms if that's all you want.  God knows it has very little plot, logic, sense, excitement, tension or characters.  A strangely lifeless film. "}]
