The results are quite good, mostly due to the performers chosen for their parts. This is not supposed to be sophisticated film-making or storytelling; just a fun ghoulish romp, perfectly suited for a Halloween Night. And it succeeds admirably.Boris Karloff returned to the Frankenstein Series with this installment, and it's an asset to the picture to have him. Some fans have accused him of walking through his part as a mad scientist here, but I've always found this to be a very understated kind of calculated evil, and he's very good here. He portrays the mad Dr. Niemann, who once dared to follow in the footsteps of the original Frankenstein, and as a result was jailed for his unethical experiments along with his hunchbacked assistant, Daniel. When a severe thunderstorm destroys the foundation of the prison he's housed in, Niemann manages an escape and attempts to locate the original diary of Dr. Frankenstein, running into Dracula, the Wolf Man, and the Frankenstein Monster along the way. J. Carrol Naish scores high points with his portrayal of the sympathetic hunchbacked assistant to Karloff, and manages to stir up our emotions as he pines away for cute gypsy girl Elena Verdugo. Lon Chaney plays The Wolf Man for a third time here, and though he's saddled with some silly dialogue (why have you freed me from the ice that imprisoned the beast that lived within me?) he has now made the tragic character of Larry Talbot the werewolf all his own. He is desperate to aid Dr. Niemann however he can, in the hopes that the scientist may be able to return the favor by curing him of his curse.John Carradine is exceptional as Dracula, playing the part differently than Bela Lugosi had. What Carradine lacked in the creepy otherworldliness of Bela, he made up for with aristocratic evil. His physical look is actually much closer to how Bram Stoker described the character in his novel, Dracula. Glenn Strange takes on the role of the hulking and imposing Frankenstein Monster for the first time, and is the next best to Karloff's interpretation of the creature, in terms of appearance. Hans J. Salter again provides a wonderfully haunting music score. Director Erle C. Kenton accentuates the proceedings with gloomy sets, dark nights and the customary thunder and lightning.This monster fest is light and breezy, packing much into its brief 70 minute running time. If there is any quibble to be made for HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN, it would be with regard to the episodic way in which its three monsters are worked into the plot. Dracula has an early segment all his own, and then the second half switches to the Wolf Man and the Frankenstein Monster. None of the creatures cross paths with another, and their screen time as ghouls is limited (especially the case for the Monster). But this is just a technicality; for those who don't go into it expecting High Art, there is still much fun to be had within the House of Frankenstein. *** out of **** "},{"Title":"The Gang Is All Here","Date":"23 July 2000","Score":"21 out of 23 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":"  House of Frankenstein was the first of the monster free for alls with all three Universal monster legends, the Frankenstein monster, the wolfman, and Dracula.  It is not the most coherent story around, but you won't care because the film has a brisk pace, imaginative scenes, creative sets, and some first-rate acting.  Boris Karloff plays a doctor in the Dr. Frankenstein tradition trying to resurrect the Monster and appease the wolfman by finding him a path to death.  He is the epitome of evil and has no moral compass whatsoever.  Karloff does a fine job in his role, and Lon Chaney, as ever saddened at his lunar plight, does a wonderful job again as Larry Talbot(his third time in the role).  Glenn Strange plays the monster..and plays him well although really has little to do in the film till the last five minutes.  Dracula is played by John Carradine. The shining stars of the cast, however, are J. Carroll Naish playing a poor murdering hunchback with low  self-esteem, and the bubbly and beautiful Elena Verdugo as a gypsy girl.  Naish gives a very poignant portrayal.  Look for cameos by Lionel Atwill and George Zucco(wish his part had been larger).  House of Frankenstein is a great film in the Universal tradition of its monsters and mayhem.  One of its other outstanding virtues is its famous score.

In a move to re-generate interest in its fading horror series, Universal gives us Dracula, the Frankenstein monster, the Wolf Man, the Hunchback and the Mad Doctor all in the same film. But where's the Mummy? It is essentially divided into two parts. We begin with the notorious Dr. Gustav Niemann (Boris Karloff) and his hunchback assistant Daniel (J. Carroll Naish) escaping from the prison in which they have been held for the past 15 years. They come upon a traveling Chamber of Horrors that supposedly includes the remains of the infamous Count Dracula, run by a Professor Lampini (George Zucco). Neimann wants to return to his home and resume his work of creating life from dead bodies and take revenge upon his accusers. The unfortunate Professor is quickly dispatched and Neimann takes his place. It turns out that the remains of Dracula are genuine and Neimann brings him back to life in the form of John Carradine. Neimann plans to use Dracula as the instrument of his revenge. He is sent to murder the local Burgomeister (Sig Ruman) and is attracted to his grand daughter Rita (Anne Gwynne). When Rita is abducted by Dracula, her husband (Peter Coe) and the local police Inspector (Lionel Atwill) give chase and ..... Meanwhile Neimann plans to go to the ruins of Frankenstein's castle to seek out the scientist's notes on the creation of his creature. Along the way they stop at a gypsy camp and Daniel becomes infatuated with a gypsy girl Ilonka (Elena Verdugo). At the castle Daniel falls into a frozen cave where they find the Wolf Man (Lon Chaney Jr.) and the Frankenstein monster (Glenn Strange). The Wolf Man changes back into Lawrence Talbot and pleads with Neimann to help rid him of his werewolf curse. Neimann takes them both back to his laboratory but becomes pre-occupied with restoring the monster rather than helping Talbot. Ilonka begins to fall in love with Talbot but is warned of Talbot's curse. The full moon comes up and you know what happens next. Daniel attacks Neimann because of his broken promises to him. The monster suddenly awakens and..... The teaming of Karloff and Chaney makes this film work. Karloff is great as the mad doctor and Chaney brings pathos and sympathy to his portrayal of the doomed Talbot. Carradine makes a surprisingly good Dracula in an all too brief appearance. Naish almost steals the film as the tragic Daniel whose love for the gypsy girl is doomed from the start. Cowboy actor and former stuntman Glenn Strange takes over as the monster but has little to do until the last reel. Atwill and Zucco sadly, make only brief appearances in minor roles. Followed by House of Dracula (1945) a similar but inferior film.

It's a simple life traveling the countryside and creating mayhem, but somebody's gotta do it, right?! Well, the maniacal doctor has a lot of unforeseen luck, as he stumbles first upon the skeleton of Dracula (who he wisely decides to revive). For some odd reason, the long-dead Dracula comes back not as Bela Lugosi but John Carradine. While a decent enough villain, it just made no sense why Lugosi didn't reprise the role. Anyway, they later discover the Frankenstein monster and the Wolfman frozen in a cave (since their last film) and spend much of their time trying to revive them--so they can kick butt and spread terror. Well, they did not foresee that the Wolfman, when in the form of nice-guy Larry Talbot, didn't want to spread terror and death (shucks). Well, the plan is shot and evil is thwarted. Cool.Strengths of the film are the evil doctor--he's a really nasty menace, having three monsters instead of the usual one and the fact that it is a Universal horror film with all its campy fun. The weaknesses are that the series is getting a little old, the pathos concerning Daniel falling for the gypsy girl is a tad annoying, and John Carradine just isn't and never could be Dracula!

And everyone does their professional best to spout the inane dialogue they're saddled with. What's wrong is the silly story that surrounds the events. A movie that promises a Monster Mash results in a collection of Monster cameos.This is a semi remake of 'Son of Frankenstein', where broken-neck Ygor used the Monster to exact his revenge. This time around, it's mad scientist Karloff (with hunchback Naish) doing the same on those who imprisoned him. But the only 'monsters' used as his proxy for revenge are Dracula and Daniel. The Wolf Man and Frankenstein's Monster show up just long enough to do their snarls before being dispatched. A nice touch was the triangle love between Talbot, the gypsy Ilonka and Daniel. And like 'Ghost of Frankenstein', there's a difference of opinion on who should be the recipient of whose brain.But this movie is still fun, probably because it's based more on my nostalgic memories from the first time I saw it as a kid rather than my harsh adult perception. (A & C Meet Frankenstein I saw 1st, at 5 yrs old...another movie with all these monsters in it??...too cool! just my silly 6 yr old opinion. This one has the best 'Wolf Man' make-up and man-to-beast transformation (the footprints & the mirror sequence). Carradine's turn as Dracula is very good, but you can't help but wonder if only Lugosi had been allowed to reprise his most famous role. And for his limited input, Strange does just fine as the Monster (better than what Chaney and Lugosi did with the role in the last two) helped by Karloff's coaching on how the monster moved and walked. And it's complete with gypsies, a castle, fog forests and an angry mob (again).So just grab some popcorn; and double up with Universal's 'House of Dracula' for a fun double feature. Just don't swallow too hard.A nostalgic 6 out of 10!

I can only assume that most movie-going audiences in the '40s were calling the monster by the F-name--so that may explain the title; a better hook to draw in the matinée audiences.After stewing in what must have been a very ancient dungeon--since the mere rumble of thunder sends the place crashing down--mad scientist Gustav Niemann (Boris Karloff) and his hunchback friend Daniel overtake a traveling chamber of horrors, with the show's main attraction being the preserved skeleton of Count Dracula--with stake still lodged between his skeletal remains.

Carrol Naish -- are bound in.Fortunately, after his escape, Niemann comes across the creepy Professor Bruno Lampini, who is conveniently taking a traveling show of horrors across the country.  His main attraction is the skeletal remains of Count Dracula (complete with wooden stake jutting from ribs).  As expected, Niemann kills Lampini, poses as the renowned crackpot, and revives the vampire (played by a 'princely' young Carradine), who, in turn, takes revenge on one of Niemann's enemies as a favor.  Oh, and then Dracula dies like a wussy and his dull little role is over as if it never existed since it never helped move along or even remotely create a plot out of this revolving-door mishmash of monster cameos (read on).Though this is essentially a sequel to 1943's Frankenstein Meets The Wolfman, the title sort of refers to Neimann's aspiration to carry on Dr. Henry Frankenstein's work (speaking of which, the Monster doesn't appear until about 45 minutes into the film), though Neimann's objectives are never quite revealed to the viewer.  Nevertheless, while exploring the ruins of the great doctor's decimated Vasarian castle and to generate some semblance of plot, Neimann finds the monster offspring of Frankenstein frozen in a block of ice near the Wolfman (Chaney), who is quickly unthawed and put to work by Neimann.  For some reason, the escaped doctor intends to switch the brain of Frankenstein's Monster with the brain of the Wolf Man, which, in itself, might have been funny.  I just wonder if the Wolfman's curse would have followed the brain or the body, and how a Wolfman with poor motor-skills would have convincingly frightened someone - `I'll rip you to shreds like a wild dog as soon as I make my way over to the other side of this room!')Again, aside from revenge, I couldn't really detect a plot, and the film has the single most abrupt ending I've ever seen!  Plus, Frankenstein's Monster (played by cowboy actor Glenn Strange rather than Karloff) does absolutely nothing as the film plods on!  Besides getting to toss a hunchback through a window (and who doesn't enjoy doing just that every now and again), he descends - quite dramatically -- into quicksand and lies around comatose the rest of the time (how about a cross-promotion film with the Weekend At Bernie's franchise -- Bernie Does Vasaria?).As the famous Universal Studios monsters continued to parade out, I began to think of the marketing possibilities this film might have had if the whole state of affairs would have been placed in the here-and-now - playsets, lunch-boxes, limited-edition bobble-heads, House of Frankenstein-flavored fruit bars, Taco Bell Wolfman Burrito tie-ins, Dr. Neimann chemistry sets, etc.!  In short, House of Frankenstein was obviously a crass attempt to bleed quick dollars out of a highly profitable franchise.  There was no attempt at veiled artistry, and you can almost hear executives counting out the money beneath the hackneyed layer of canned shrieks!  On a lighter note, the film would have easily qualified for 'self-parody' status with a bonus appearance from the Mummy!  I certainly wouldn't have been surprised if he had been worked into the plot somewhere!!Despite all the film's shortcomings, I was truly mesmerized by Karloff's hammy staging.  In fact, his best performance comes during the film's opening scene, where his peculiar character strangles a prison guard for a piece of chalk just so he can continue to draw scientific diagrams on his wall.

By pure chance he happens to run across a travelling circus which happens to have the genuine skeleton of Count Dracula. It isn't long before he slaughters the circus folk and removes the stake from the vampire's heart, reviving him. He then makes his way to the castle of Frankenstein and in a glacial ice cavern he discovers both Frankenstein's monster and the Wolf Man frozen in ice. He thaws them and takes them back to his laboratory, promising new life for the monster and a cure for the Wolf Man. But a beautiful gypsy girl causes conflict between them ...While the story for this one comes from Curt Siodmak, the team of director Erle C. Kenton and scriptwriter Edward T. Lowe Jr. created both the House of Frankenstein and the House of Dracula sequels. The only one of the monsters that's actually still being played by the same actor here is Lon Chaney Jr's Wolf Man. Boris Karloff appears, but not as the Frankenstein monster. Instead he plays Doctor Niemann (who amusingly gets called a 'would-be Frankenstein' in the first scene), while Glenn Strange plays the monster. But fear not -- both turn in excellent performances all the same, with Glenn Strange proving himself to be such a great choice for Frankenstein that he would return again in House of Dracula and Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein.J. Carrol Naish is also noteworthy as Niemann's hunchback assistant. However, this was John Carradine's first appearance as Dracula, and he's barely even slightly creepy. He's not a patch on Bela Lugosi (although much better then some of the other actors who portrayed Dracula), and the vampire bat effects are as bad as ever, if not worse. Thankfully he only has a very small part anyway. And considering the movie is called House of Frankenstein, Frankenstein doesn't have a very big part either, but what small screen time he has is particularly memorable -- the climax is one of the most thrilling out of any of the Universal monster movies. The Wolf Man is the more interesting and sympathetic character, so once again he has the most screen time.This is an entertaining movie that throws in everything but the kitchen sink.

Upon seeing it again, I change that assessment enthusiastically.  House of Frankenstein is not only tremendous but it's my favorite Frankenstein sequel since Bride.  The movie is essentially in two parts although the first is shorter then the second.  Call the first the Dracula segment and the second the Wolfman/Monster segment.  Holding them together is Boris Karloff as Dr. Niemann who escapes from prison with his assistant Daniel and sets out to find the three men who sent him to prison.  So many things happen in this movie that it's impossible to list them all.  Niemann gets ahold of a traveling show and eventually enlists Dracula, who helps him to kill one of his enemies.  This segment is slam blam with Dracula seducing a young woman, killing the burgomeister, running from the law and eventually dying amidst the dawn.  It happens so fast and is done so well that it never has a chance to get old.  The movie moves onto segment two and has Karloff finding the monster and Wolfman while searching for the always elusive Frankenstein notes.  Daniel sees a gypsy girl upon entering the town and falls in love her.  She, however, is repulsed by his deformed hump.  J. Carrol Nash as Daniel actually becomes the main character in the movie.  He is the sympathetic figure who loyally kills for and helps Niemann (while waiting for Niemann to give him a new body) while becoming the central figure in the Daniel/gypsy girl/Talbot triangle.  He also draws the ire of the monster and almost kills Niemann before being rudely dispatched by the monster.  J. Carrol Naish as Daniel is excellent.  A lesser actor in the role may have seriously hurt the movie.  Karloff doesn't have much to do other than be the mad doctor but his presence contributes mightily.  Karloff is to horror films like Sean Connery was to Bond films.  All he has to do is look at you to get your attention.  Elena Verdugo is excellent as the gypsy girl Ilonka although her love scenes with Talbot come off a little stiffly.  The even a man who is pure at heart werewolf mantra is also changed slightly.  Lon Chaney does less whining and is more physical with his demands this go around.  Even the mob of villagers is done differently.  While searching for the Wolfman, one man says We're early I guess.  Another says, Oh so he appears on schedule like a train is that it?  Niemann captures his other enemies and threatens all kinds of whacky brain transfers before the movie ends logically and satisfyingly.  Low points are the near nothing role of the monster and the painted sets which sometimes look fake.  Other sets are splendidly Universal.

Even though we were led to believe that Dracula's corpse was burned (in the film Dracula's Daughter), Niemann has no trouble restoring the vampire to undead life in the form of the suave John Carradine, whose tall, gaunt appearance lends itself well to the character. We then get a rather lightweight 15 minute episode in which Dracula does his usual routine of turning into a bat and sucking blood from innocent people at the behest of Niemann who has some old scores to settle. When Dracula finds himself being chased by an angry mob, Niemann leaves him to his fate and then goes on to the next town and the next adventure, which finds him discovering the frozen bodies of the Wolf Man and Frankenstein's monster.So begins the movie proper and the characters' motives all come into play. Niemann wants revenge on those who incarcerated him and plans to do so by putting their brains into the bodies of the monsters he has just revived. Daniel has fallen for a Gypsy girl, Ilonka, who likes him but finds his physical appearance distasteful, so he wants to be given a new body. The ideal choice, he feels, would be the body of cursed werewolf Larry Talbot (once more played by Lon Chaney Jr, who conveys the burden of his affliction superbly) since Ilonka is smitten by him. Talbot only wants Niemann to put him out of his misery permanently so that he can finally escape the curse of being a werewolf.The love triangle between Daniel, Ilonka and Talbot is probably the closest this film comes to having a meaningful plot and whilst it's handled competently, it's all rather too rushed for it have any depth, a knock-on effect from having too many elements in the one film and from devoting a quarter of the movie to an unrelated Dracula storyline. Whilst Talbot as a character plays a significant part in the proceedings, his alter ego the Wolf Man has very little to do and is barely seen. And if you're wondering why I haven't mentioned the Frankenstein Monster much yet, that's because the same is true of him. From his introduction half way through the film he lies dormant on a bench in a laboratory, and only springs into life 5 minutes from the end. He doesn't encounter Dracula, he doesn't encounter the Wolf Man... But he does encounter yet another mob of torch-bearing villagers (see most of his previous film appearances).All in all, House Of Frankenstein oddly chooses to circumnavigate its biggest selling points. With so many interesting characters and actors in the film (including Lionel Atwill, George Zucco in regrettably small roles), a better storyline giving the monsters more involvement might not only have paid dividends, it could have re-ignited the whole Universal monster series. As it is, it's more of a Boris Karloff-as-a-mad-scientist film. Not a bad thing, as Karloff is always interesting to watch, but definitely a missed opportunity.

Carroll Naish in a surprisingly tepid performance) with tales of how he had nearly put the brain of a human into a dog. This gives Daniel hope. If brain switcheroos were possible, wouldn't that mean his own brain could be removed to a better home than the misshapen body he's now trapped in? A thunderstorm destroys their prison, and they escape to find refuge in the company of a traveling carnival. It seems the carnival owner (George Zucco) has possession of the skeleton of Count Dracula (John Carradine), who can be revived by removing the wooden stake from the area of his heart. Niemann has the hunchback kill the owner, and then resurrects Dracula to kill those who had sent him to prison.Dracula has other plans, and his part of the story is resolved 27 minutes into the movie. Later, Niemann and the hunchback encounter a gypsy caravan where Daniel falls in love with a beautiful gypsy girl shades of Victor Hugo's Hunchback of Notre Dame. She winds up traveling with them to Frankenstein's ruined castle, where they find Frankenstein's monster (Glenn Strange, his first appearance in this role) and the Wolf Man frozen in ice. Niemann thaws them out, finding the Monster fairly inert and the Wolf Man changed back to the tormented Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney, Jr.). To Daniel's misery, the gypsy girl falls in love with Talbot, unaware of his lupine alter ego. Meanwhile, Niemann promises both the hunchback and Talbot new bodies; but for some reason he wants to put Talbot's brain into the Monster's body.Where would Daniel's brain go? Talbot's body? The gypsy girl's? A stray dog's? The movie already has ten times more plot than it needs; maybe this detail got lost. I didn't even mention Sig Ruman as a burgomeister; Peter Coe as his smiley son with a face full of baby fat; or Anne Gwynne as Coe's wife and Dracula's would-be mistress. Oh, and Lionel Atwill returns as the Inspector from Son of Frankenstein&#x97;but what happened to his mechanical right arm? Now both arms seem to be real.Bride of &#x85; and Son of &#x85; were tongue-in-cheek, but House of &#x85; is asinine. It has the kind of unintentional surrealism that results not from an artistic mind, but from studio executives demanding that X number of popular elements go into their new product. It reminded me of old Saturday morning cartoons like Jabberjaw, which featured a shark (Jaws was popular) that talked like Curly (the Three Stooges), complained that he got no respect (Rodney Dangerfield), and solved mysteries (Scooby Doo) with a teen rock band (Josie and Pussycats). Here we get The Mad Scientist! Frankenstein's Monster! The Hunchback! Dracula! The Wolf Man!You can't hate a movie this wacky, especially when isolated scenes are effective. (The Wolf Man always frightens me, even when he meets Abbott and Costello.) But you have to wonder what James Whale would have done had he been forced to cram all these monsters into a single movie. Would the project have dispirited him, or would he have created something even more weird and wonderful than Bride of Frankenstein?

Strange enough, it is not as bad as it sounds.Legendary Boris Karloff plays the mad scientist, Dr. Niemann, who was imprisoned because of his bizarre experiments. Durng a storm, he and his assistant Daniel the Hunchback (J. Carrol Naish) manage to escape, and decide to find Dr. Frankenstein's diaries in order to learn from his discoveries.In his travel, they will find count Dracula (John Carradine), the Wolf Man (Lon Chaney Jr.) and Frankenstein's monster himself (Glenn Strange). As silly as it sounds, the movie works, mainly because of the power of the actors, as well as Erle C. Kenton's direction, who manages to do here what he failed to attempt in his last horror, Ghost of Frankenstein.In this movie, Kenton uses his characters the way he always wanted, with more humor and less horror, fulfilling the slow transformation of the franchise from Gothic horror to campy comedy. Boris Karloff is superb as the scientist and shows his wide range as an actor. He was certainly more than his famous role of the monster in the first three Frankenstein movies.Lon Chaney Jr. continues in his classic role as the tormented Larry Talbot, and while both John Carradine and Glenn Strange receive very few screen time, their appearance is well received.The main problem of the movie is that with the exception of the Wolf Man and the Hunchback, the rest of the characters receives very little development. While Karloff makes a great job, his character remains as mysterious as he started, and the creature and Dracula are almost reduced to cameos that serve to move the plot.Nevertheless, the movie manage to deliver the fun it promises, as it never gets tiresome or boring. Viewed as a horror movie, it certainly fails to impress, but honestly, this works better as dark comedy. 6/10 "},{"Title":"Monster Mash ?

The problem with FMTWM was that it never successfully meshed the Frankenstein monster with the Lawrence Talbot storyline and this film makes an even bigger mess of bringing the monsters together Casting Karloff as Dr Niemann must have been something of a coup for the studio but the problem is that pushes the much anticipated monster parade to the periphery of the story . In fact if the monsters didn't appear at all you might have had a better movie since Karloff is so entertaining in his role but this is a franchise film involving a monster cavalcade so the monsters must remain even though screenwriter Edward T Lowe obviously doesn't know what to do with them Count Dracula gets the short straw and amounts to a mere cameo .

And it's actually a blessing they did, since House of Frankenstein is much more entertaining than its predecessor! Is it because Boris Karloff is part of the cast again, because the overall tone of the film was much more light-headed, or maybe because I simply was in a less demanding mood? I don't know, but this film was enormously fun to watch and I can easily recommend it to open-minded fans of classic horror cinema. In addition to the luminaries of the aforementioned Frankenstein meets the Wolf Man, this film also features Dracula, a mad scientist with vengeance on his mind, a hunchback in love with a gypsy girl and a traveling freak-show! If you're wondering how all these classical monsters with their different backgrounds can be mangled into one screenplay, don't worry too much, as the writers clearly didn't know it either. It's extremely incoherent and silly, but at the same time strangely watchable thanks to the enthusiast performances and the constantly ingenious change of settings. Karloff doesn't reprise his Frankenstein monster role; instead he's a great admirer & follower of Baron Frankenstein's scientific work, only he's madder and a lot more malicious. Rotting away in prison for the past 15 years, Dr. Niemann sees his chance to escape and go after the people responsible for his interrupted research. Together with his hunchbacked sidekick, Dr. Niemann car-jacks a circus show and heads for Vesaria to search for Frankenstein's original work. Along the way, our crazy twosome makes several necessary stops to resurrect dead monster, either because Niemann needs them for his vengeance plans or for his new experiments. House of Frankenstein exists out of two main chapters. Sadly, the legendary icons are never partying together in one room. Dracula, terrifically portrayed by John Carradine, never has the pleasure of meeting Wolf Man Larry Talbot and the Frankenstein monster only briefly opens his eyes & mouth in the final moments of the film. The acting performances are all great, with Boris Karloff and J. Carol Naish shining as the fugitive loonies. Lionel Atwill and George Zucco make a guest appearance, although I wish their roles had been larger. Approximately 60 years later, Universal wasted their money on Van Helsing; another film that tried to unite all the legendary monsters of the classic cinema screen. That movie was a huge failure, since the creators showed more affection to the computer engineered effects instead of to the monstrous characters. Stick with the black & white versions!

Karloff had strong affection for the part and he was too appreciative for all the Monster had done to make him famous.Karloff was even against the changes made to the character in the Bride Of...('35) and the Son Of...('39);so it's very understandable that he'd never actually play the Monster after the 1939 film.Boris Karloff could see that the role would degrade to merely a sidekick for other Universal monsters such as The Wolf Man and later Count Dracula in Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein(1948).As House Of Frankenstein begins,we discover that Karloff is Dr. Gustav Niemann who has long been imprisoned in the Neustadt Prison with a hunchbacked killer named Daniel played by J.Carrol Naish.Neimann is the epitome of a mad scientist(having once given a dog the brain of a man) with his ancient jail cell covered in chalk writings,drawings and mathematical equations while he speaks reverently of the late Baron Henry Frankenstein.Lightning strikes the old prison and destroys both the Dr.'s and Daniel's cells ...allowing them to escape together.After helping Professor Bruno Lampini(George Zucco) get his wagons unstuck from a rain drenched road,they murder him and his driver and take over the traveling show. Karloff carries in the traveling show the skeleton of Count Dracula(John Carradine)who he allows to return to life as long as the vampire does his bidding.This section of the film is an excellent way to start this Monster movie off with a bang!John Carradine makes a superb Dracula with gray hair,a gray moustache and a top hat turned slightly to the side.This Dracula seduces Anne Gwynne by allowing her to see the supernatural world that he's returned from.But she's his downfall because he kidnaps her which causes Niemann and Daniel to abandon him. Dracula dies from the sun's rays hitting him before he can get to his coffin. Carradine gives one of the absolute best interpretations ever of the Count...he's in too little of this film.Neimann travels to the village of Frankenstein now where Daniel meets a gypsy girl(Elena Verdugo)who's injured after being beaten by a male gypsy.Dr.Neimann and Daniel inspect the Castle Frankenstein's ruins,but as they search the duo come upon a ice cavern that holds the frozen bodies of Frankenstein's Monster(Glenn Strange) and the Wolf Man(Lon Chaney Jr.).They build 2 fires to set the frozen Monsters free because Neimann wants to get his hands on Henry Frankenstein's notes. Larry Talbot(Chaney)agrees to help Niemann in his search because the Mad Dr. has promised to build Talbot a brain that will relieve him of his werewolfism. The group returns to Niemann's old laboratory with Karloff's Niemann only interested in working on the Frankenstein Monster while the Mad Scientist lies to Talbot who continues to go through his nightly changes as he turns into the Wolf Man and kills.Niemann and Daniel go to Visaria and murder 2 men who helped to put the Dr. in Jail.Their brains are to actually go into the Frankenstein Monster and the Wolf Man because Niemann wants them to suffer! Ultimately,he brings the Monster back to full strength while the gypsy girl(who has fallen in love with Talbot)is attacked by the Wolf Man(who kills Verdugo's gypsy)...but she kills the Wolf Man with a silver bullet.Both Die.Daniel is heartbroken and takes the girl's dead body back to Niemann to revive.However,the Dr. refuses.Karloff's Gustav Niemann is only interested in his own depraved wants.So Daniel attacks him and as the 2 fight,Glenn Strange's Frankenstein Monster bursts his bonds.The Monster attacks Daniel,throws him through a laboratory window to his death.The Visaria villagers storm Niemann's laboratory and chase the Monster(carrying Dr.Niemann) into some quicksand where both perish. House Of Frankenstein is a fun film that's a classic in a minor way because this film is very much a B film...but it is hard to dislike (although very contrived).At one point, the film was to even have had the Mummy in it...but the makers decided against that idea, ultimately. Had a little more thought and screen running time been given to it,House Of Frankenstein(1944)might've ended up being as celebrated as the first 3 films in the Frankenstein series...but this Frankenstein film is still worth watching.

Kenton, returns Boris Karloff to the Frankenstein series, but not as the Monster, the role he immortalized in FRANKENSTEIN (1931); BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN (1935) and SON OF FRANKENSTEIN (1939). Instead, he stars as Doctor Gustav Nieman, a semi-mad scientist serving time in prison, accompanied by his hunchback assistant, Daniel (J. Carroll Naish). Nieman. Neimann is a follower of the late scientist who created a fiendish monster from dead bodies years ago, and plans on following through with Frankenstein's experiments. With a stroke of luck, lightning strikes over the prison, breaking down the wall, causing Niemann and Daniel to be set free. The two men soon happen upon a traveling sideshow consisting of a museum of horrors. After doing away with the carnival owner, Professor Bruno Lampini (George Zucco), they take control of his wagon consisting the body of Count Dracula (John Carradine). Nieman removes the stake from his heart and the skeleton remains of Dracula transforms itself into human form, resurrecting the vampire from the dead of eternal condemnation. Nieman then uses Dracula to help him kill the men responsible for sending him to prison, particularly Burgomaster Hussman (Sig Rumann). After doing his evil deeds, Dracula meets his doom when unable to return to his coffin by sunset. Next Niemann and Daniel find themselves taking in an abused gypsy girl, Ilonka (Elena Verdugo), whom Daniel cares for and loves. After locating the remains of Frankenstein's Monster (Glenn Strange), frozen beneath the ice of the Frankenstein castle, along with the Wolf Man (Lon Chaney Jr.), thus picking up where FRANKENSTEIN AND THE WOLF MAN has left off, Niemann sets them free. Neimann promises to end Lawrence Talbot's werewolf curse through the operation of a new brain but is in need of locating Frankenstein's thesis, The Secret of Life and Death. After it is found, Niemann shows more interest in reviving the unconscious monster than helping Talbot. More conflicts arise when Ilonka shows more interest in Talbot than with Daniel, leading to his jealousy and madness.HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN repeats the formula used in the previous Monster feast, FRANKENSTEIN MEETS THE WOLF MAN (1943), in which the story brings together legendary monsters into one single film, this time combining the elements of Count Dracula, The Wolf Man and Frankenstein's Monster. However, instead of featuring them all together in one set plot, which could have worked a whole lot better, this production is actually three separate stories in one with Doctor Niemann as the focal point. Although HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN does have the makings of a great horror film, in many ways, probably looked better in script form. The biggest weakness is cramming so many incidents into 70 minutes, leaving no time for plot development and character study. The best segment is one involving Count Dracula. For reasons only known to Universal, John Carradine steps in as the Count rather than its originator, Bela Lugosi. Carradine, however, makes a good substitute, giving a new dimensional look to the Dracula legend tall, thin, supporting a mustache, creepy eyes, and no Hungarian accent. Carradine's Dracula walks about with top hat and cane under the alias of Baron LaToes. As for Chaney, his transformation scenes from wolf man to Talbot, etc., and special effects that go with it, are still first rate. Along with Dracula, the Wolf Man isn't given much to do, and neither does the Monster. Of the actors chosen to play Frankenstein's Monster, Glenn Strange is probably the worst, playing him more like an imbecile, leaving nothing to the character created by Karloff. By this time, the stories contradict the previous films. (Wasn't Ygor's brain placed in the Monster's head in THE GHOST OF FRANKENSTEIN? Now, what happened to Ygor?). Why can't the Monster talk?Although HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN relatively belongs to Karloff and Naish, Naish comes off best. Regardless that his character kills as ordered by his master (Karloff), Naish's Daniel is a sympathetic portrayal, naive and caring, in the way Lon Chaney Sr. might have played him had assumed this particular role. His Daniel also continues to care for the gypsy girl knowing that she has lost interest in him.In spite of its title, there are no characters in the film bearing the Frankenstein name, and if the name Frankenstein is associated with the Monster, he's hardly there. This is also the only known film in which Lawrence Talbot is referred to as The Wolf Man. Lionel Atwill, who previously appeared in earlier Frankenstein segments starting with THE SON (1939), returns once more, and again, in a different portrayal, this time as Inspector Arnz in the earlier portion involving Dracula. His scenes, too, are brief.The supporting cast also includes the Universal stock company of Anne Gwynne as Rita Hussman Peter Coe as her husband, Carl; Brandon Hurst as Doctor Geissler; with Philip Van Zandt as Inspector Muller; Frank Reicher as Ullman; and Brandon Hurst as Doctor Geissler. Contrary to the outcome of HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN, Universal would repeat this formula again in its next sequel, HOUSE OF Dracula (1945). And after running out of houses, Universal would end it all by having their studio monsters meeting up with Abbott and Costello before the end of the decade.HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN, which is available on video cassette, did enjoy frequent revivals and resurrections on local commercial television stations for many years starting from the late 1950s before heading over on cable channels where they were shown for quite some time on the Sci-Fi Channel and/ or American Movie Classics. To really enjoy HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN is to not take it too seriously, accepting it for what it is, a campy horror film.

This is the follow up to Universal's 1943 film, Frankenstein Meets The Wolf Man and pretty much forsakes the story put forward in the Frankenstein series up to this point. We follow Dr Gustav Niemann and his assistant Daniel as they make an easy escape from prison, and soon find themselves travelling with a circus whose main attraction is the skeleton of Count Dracula. After resurrecting the king of vampires, our doctor finds The Wolf Man and Frankenstein's Monster encased in ice, and proceeds to use them to exact revenge on people who have wrong him.Modern mess Van Helsing tried to create a plot that takes in all three of these monsters, and failed miserably. This film doesn't, and while it gets a little bit too camp at times and it doesn't always make perfect sense, House of Frankenstein manages to give equal credence to all of its big players, and the film features moments that allow the Monster, Dracula and The Wolf Man to shine. The plot moves quickly, which ensures that the film never dries up and becomes boring, and the camp atmosphere helps it along in this respect also. The acting is one of the film's major strongpoints, and Boris Karloff, in the lead role, holds the film together brilliantly. Lon Chaney Jr once again brings sympathy to his role as The Wolf Man, and it's his segment in the tale that is put furthest towards the front. John Carradine doesn't get to do a lot as Dracula, but considering that he isn't Bela Lugosi; he's not too bad. Glen Strange looks the part as the monster, while cult actors George Zucco and Lionel Atwill shine in lesser roles.

Boris Karloff doesn't play a 'monster' in this one but instead portrays a terrific and typical villainous professor role alá professor Frankenstein. So for the fans of classic Universal Pictures monster movies this already are all more than enough reasons to watch this movie.The movie is more a sequel to Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man than it is to any of the other Frankenstein, Dracula and The Wolf Man movies, made before this one.The story is very weak (especially the beginning is maybe even border-line laughable) but the fun of having those three classic monsters in one and the same movie compensates for this and towards the ending the story even gets better and somewhat more realistic. The movie can be seen as two different ones. The first part is with Dr. Gustav Niemann, Daniel, Dracula and the family Hussman and the second part is with and about Dr. Gustav Niemann, Daniel, The Wolf Man, The Frankenstein Monster and the gypsy girl Ilonka. No, the movie doesn't feel completely as a whole and the first part of the movie with Dracula just feels pointless and doesn't really serve a purpose in the story. John Carradine however is a good Dracula although he tries a bit too hard to copy Bela Lugosi's Dracula role. Understandable of course since both play the same role but it just looks a bit weird when Carradine tries to act and look scary with his eyes in a way only Lugosi could successfully do.It was surprising to see how much more at ease and better Lon Chaney Jr. was in his role compared to the previously made movies featuring the Wolf Man in it. Karloff is also in good form. It's a bit sad, Karloff will always be remembered for playing the mumbling Frankenstein creature even though Karloff was a very good actor, this movie is one more bit of proof of Karloff's acting skills. Glenn Strange was surprising convincing as the Frankenstein monster and he actually looked quite a bit like the Karloff Frankenstein monster version. It was also fun to see Lionel Atwill again in a role as police inspector, a role he had played before in many other Frankenstein and Dracula movies. I wouldn't be surprised if he had been in more horror movies than Karloff or Chaney Jr.This movie is very entertaining, only thanks to the classic monsters in it and the actors.

There are three other actors well known for these kinds of films, and pretty well known at that. When Karloff kidnaps Ullman and Strauss, they're played by Frank Reicher and Michael Mark. Look at the footage again and you'll spot them. Reicher, of course, was the ship's captain in King Kong but among his seemingly hundreds of roles he appeared in Night Monster, The Mummy's Tomb, The Face Behind the Mask, Dr. Cyclops, Devil Doll, The Invisible Ray and others. Mark appeared in The Mummy's Hand, Tower of London, Son of Frankenstein, The Black Room, The Black Cat and as Little Maria's father in Frankenstein. The doctor who tells us that the victim's throat was ripped out by an animal, Dr. Geissler, is played by Brandon Hurst, best remembered as the butler Silver in White Zombie.

In other words, they treated a lighthearted, not-to-be-taken-seriously project as if it were brooding and provocative like the first two movies, most notably James Whale's masterwork Bride of Frankenstein. As a result, The Ghost of Frankenstein was a little slow-going for me. However, the following picture in the franchise (or at least on my DVD collection) House of Frankenstein was a step down in quality, but up in entertainment. Because this movie recognizes that it is low-key and packed full of kitsch, and makes the best of it. That's the secret to its charm and I would be a hypocrite if I told you I did not enjoy watching it.The movie clocks at a brisk seventy-one minutes and every frame of it stirs up nostalgia and a sense of fun. The movie is called House of Frankenstein really because it combines several iconic characters. Boris Karloff stars not as the green-skinned monster, but a mad scientist (not Dr. Frankenstein) seeking out revenge on those who threw him behind bars. To exact his revenge, he calls upon the Frankenstein monster (played by Glenn Strange), Count Dracula (John Carradine), the Wolf Man (Lon Chaney Jr.), and a hunchback (J. Carrol Naish). Along the way, they pick up a cabaret dancer (Anne Gwynne) who catches the eye of the hunchback, but loves the Wolf-Man whenever he's not howling at the moon.Sure, it's silly and the movie has no real purpose for any of the creatures. Heck, Count Dracula's scenes could have been entirely excised from the picture and nobody would have known the difference. The Frankenstein monster exists for no other reason than to be there for the climax. The only creature that has any real sense of belonging is the Wolf-Man. It's a real treat that Lon Chaney Jr. reprised his immortalizing role here. But everybody else seems just obligatory to be in the picture. This movie is a dartboard for critics, but this one had a great time and has no regrets in saying so.Every now and then this picky, pro-and-con-measuring reviewer is in the mood for a big, fast-moving hunk of cheese wrapped in a big ball and House of Frankenstein delivers. It knows precisely what it is doing, it has an eye-candy cast, lots of hammy dialogue that is delivered with deliberate pretentiousness, and it never dulls out. Sure, it's dimwitted, but it's a lot of fun.

They disguise themselves as some sideshow workers after killing the owner. What this show is parading is the bones of Dracula in his coffin, so Niemann accidentally revives Dracula by removing the stake. Niemann heads to Frankenstein's castle in the hope of finding Frankenstein's records, but he comes across The Wolf Man and Frankenstein frozen in ice. Wanting to find these notes, he thaws out the monsters, in the hope that they would help him and in turn he'll do the same for them. Larry Talbot takes up the offer, but the doctor's intentions are a little more deceiving. While also in the mix is a young gypsy girl that Daniel likes, but she falls for Talbot.House Of Frankenstein is pretty much second-rate when compared to the earlier Universal Frankenstein films, but what it lacks in classy elegance and importance, it makes up for in inventive style and sheer amusement. Although there's no much of a relationship between this film to the earlier Frankenstein efforts. As there's no Frankenstein family members written in. Writer Curt Siodmark's story is a silly (and at times unusual) b-grade splash that wants to incorporate the three iconic monsters (plus another two fiends being a mad doctor and hunchback) into the central story, but honestly it's made up of separate chapters that solely focuses on that specific character and their actions then really melding into a consistent one. Even with it's busy and contrived structure, it does keep a good rhythm and never feels overpopulated with its ideas. I actually find the opening half to be more interesting then the second half. Despite the title, if I was Frankenstein. I'll feel cheated, as he gets very little to do and on the other side of the coin. The Dracula segment just came and went in such an anticlimactic build up, which is disappointing, because the very palatable John Carradine nails down the part. His gaunt appearance and piercing stare adds to the charismatic appeal. The lightweight script keeps it quite lively and soaks up many wonderful dialogues and interactions with the right amount of conviction. It plays pretty much like a tragic play that cooks up captivating pawn-like situations, where the doctor basically uses everyone for his own gain. What we get is far from horror, but more of a comedy in the material's execution.Erle C. Kenton's direction is quickly paced, slickly tailored and to the point with his memorable visuals (nice silhouette work) and set-pieces ( a thrilling stage coach chase). Highlighting that, is the broodingly misty atmospheric shine it boasts from the highly vivid and large scope set-designs and backdrops. Sharply active photography and a strongly composed musical score gives it an hypnotically professional brush. Solid make-up and special effects are worked in accordingly and still crackles with charm. A reliable cast adds another dimension with their fitting chemistry. Borris Karloff this time isn't hidden behind the make-up and neatly hams it up as the selfishly manipulative Dr. Niemann. Although the terrific performance would have to go to J. Carroll Naish's humanely underfoot turn as Daniel the hunchback. Lon Chaney Jr. goes about his trademark character with sad restrained, which is delightfully moving. Glenn Strange gets to wear the make-up of the monster, while he looks it, he doesn't have the same presence when in action. In small support roles is the colourfully vibrant Elena Verdugo, Lionel Atwill, George Zucco, Sig Ruman and Anne Gwynne.House Of Frankenstein is an enthusiastic display of these classic monsters, which makes this outing purely light-hearted fun. Nothing more, nothing less.

Niemann will murder Professor Lampini(George Zucco, rather wasted in a VERY minor role)taking his identity of traveling promoter for his Chamber of Horrors. Desiring revenge for being sent to prison, Niemann first sets his sights on the village of Reigelberg to kill Burgomeister Hussman(Sig Ruman). Lampini had removed the skeletal remains of Dracula as an exhibit, with the stake still firmly wedged in his heart. Niemann removes the stake promising he'll watch over Dracula's coffin at night if the vampire murders Hussman. Under the disguise of Baron Latos, Dracula(John Carradine, quite effective in his limited screen time)will do as Niemann wishes but makes the mistake of pursuing Hussman's married granddaughter Rita(Anne Gwynne)..Upon stopping at Frankenstein village, Daniel lusts after a pretty dancing gypsy ,Ilonka(Elena Verdugo)and saves her from the whipping of a thief. Coercing Niemann to carry her along, Ilonka will join them upward to Frankenstein's castle ruins. Niemann and Daniel find The Monster and The Wolf Man Larry Talbot(Lon Chaney, Jr, still weary and sorrowful for having his affliction, but the sympathy for this character is waning..)encased in blocks of ice underneath Frankenstein's castle. Niemann releases them from their temporary tombs, promising to cure Talbot of his affliction if he helps find Frankenstein's records. They head for Niemann's laboratory in Visaria where, on the journey, Ilonka and Talbot fall in love with Daniel growing jealous of this budding relationship and Niemann's not fixing his body as promised. Niemann, in fact, promised Daniel the body of an Adonis. With Niemann only concerned with revenge against two assistants who betrayed him to police, regarding his experiments, for wages and bringing strength back to the Monster, both Talbot and Daniel grow impatient and angry. Talbot hopes that Ilonka will kill him with a silver bullet and Daniel will finally confront Niemann once and for all regarding not doing as he promised..Episodic which really is the only method when trying to form a movie with so many characters. My favorite part of the film has Carradine as Dracula. I thought he looked the part..completely sinister with a strong presence on screen. I was actually quite disappointed when his part in the movie was over. I think Naish captures that sympathy quite well taking a completely different approach to his hunchback than Dwight Frye.

Among his exhibits are the remains of Count Dracula and when the stake gets pulled out John Carradine comes to life as the Count. The part that was hardest for me to swallow was Dracula being the stooge of someone else, Karloff in this case. Dracula is a powerful unearthly creature and I refuse to believe Karloff could bend him to his will.But after Dracula is disposed of midway during the film, Karloff and Naish move on to the site of the old Frankenstein castle where the good doctor conducted his experiments. A great place to set up shop and in doing so, Karloff uncovers the Frankenstein monster that he originally played, this time played by Glenn Strange. And they uncover the frozen body of Lawrence Talbot, the Wolfman who was Lon Chaney, Jr.Completing the cast are Anne Gwynne and Elena Verdugo who are menaced by one or more of these creatures.

Still, the film starts off well enough with Boris Karloff (forsaking the monster persona for that of the mad scientist) and hunchback assistant J.

Lon Chaney Jr. basically sleep-walks through his role (even more so in the following film), especially when saddled with an insipid romantic partner in Elena Verdugo, but his initial transformation - focusing on his footprints - is superbly handled.

As a result of the healthy revenue this idea generated, Universal films decided to upgrade the theme and involve Count Dracula too, in their following team-up. Artistically, it was clearly the beginning of the end of these monster films &#x96; but while there was money to be made, the studio was quite content to continue.Here, John Carradine played the Count &#x96; suave and cultured. It isn't quite clear why Bela Lugosi wasn't involved, but I have read he was considered too 'old' &#x85; to play a centuries old vampire. Carradine brings a cadaverous charm to the role, but is featured only briefly before being reduced to a skeleton by the inevitable dawn (in his final scenes, half his moustache is missing &#x96; possibly a side effect of the encroaching daylight!).Boris Karloff returns to the series, this time to play mad old Doctor Neimann, who plans to kill the various men who found him guilty of his many crimes &#x96; just as Ygor had done in 'Son of Frankenstein' five years earlier. It is revealed that Neimann's brother assisted Frankenstein in his original experiments. Whilst no-one is, at this stage, too concerned with continuity, that would indicate his brother was Fritz from the original film, played by Dwight Frye.My favourite character in this, however, is the sympathetic Daniel, a hunchback, played by J. Carrol Naish, who falls in love with gypsy lass Ilonka (Elena Verdugo) &#x96; but she has designs on Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr). I find Ilonka's tactlessness AD 1972irritating. She can't understand why Daniel does not enjoying hearing her stories of how she loves the erstwhile Wolfman, and gets quite tetchy about it.What's the matter, Daniel - don't you like Larry? she asks, exasperated, wilfully blind to the hunchback's hopeless love for her.And so the pecking order continues. No-one cares about Daniel, so he in turn takes his frustrations out on the one character lower on the scale than himself &#x96; the mostly comatose Frankenstein Monster. Forever strapped to a laboratory table, this now thankless role is played by a newcomer to the series Glenn Strange. Strange is the only actor besides Karloff who was chosen for what he could bring to the Monster, as opposed to being a 'name', and his powerful frame and wonderfully craggy face lend themselves very impressively to Jack Pierce's make-up. Apparently Karloff himself coached Strange on set as to how to move like the Monster. Such a shame the story didn't allow him much to do other than drag Niemann into a bog full of quicksand. I would have loved to see Strange play the role in a story more worthy of him.

Much like THE MONSTER SQUAD from my own childhood, the fun of this movie is the idea of taking a few of Universal's most loved monsters and mashing them together.After the success of FRANKENSTEIN MEETS THE WOLFMAN, Universal decided to push the concept even further. Originally planned to have a whole gang of monsters, the final product includes Frankenstein, the Wolf Man, Dracula, a mad scientist and his hunchbacked assistant. As far as Universal continuity, this is the 3rd Wolf Man film, the 6th in the Frankenstein saga and I'm not even going to try to figure out where this fits in the confusing Dracula continuity. We'll have to admit, though, that it's not truly a mix of the three great monsters, as the Dracula segment takes the first half and he disappears before we get to the Frankenstein/ Wolf Man segment of the movie. For a true mix, you'll have to wait for HOUSE OF Dracula.The movie is not just merely concept, though. There are truly some fantastic scenes, especially in the first half of the movie. The scene is set as Karloff, as a mad scientist, is in prison explaining to his hunchbacked assistant that he has learned all of Doc Frankenstein's secrets (somehow, his brother was an assistant to the doctor we never met in 5 previous movies and before his death was able to impart all of the doc's wisdom to Karloff). A freak storm leads to their escape from prison. They encounter a sideshow master named Lampini, who they murder in order to steal his identity. It seems Karloff is bent on revenge against everyone who ever wronged him, beginning with the burgermeister. This leads to an excellent scene as several locals attend the sideshow now led by Karloff. It's the kind of spooky carnival attraction that I still love now and it's here that we begin our Dracula plot. Without too much detail, the vampire is eventually betrayed by Karloff and at that point in the movie, we switch gears entirely, as we switch to the ruins of Frankenstein's castle, with new revenge to be plotted and the discovery of the Wolf Man and the Frankenstein monster.Karloff plays a sadistic, maniacal scientist bent of resurrecting the monster to enact his revenge. He really carries this movie, especially in the first half as his genius acting creates a truly interesting villain. J. Carroll Naish plays his hunchbacked assistant, in a nod to both Fritz and Ygor in the prior Frankenstein movies. He falls for a gypsy dancer, in an homage to the Hunckback of Notre Dame as well. It's his character that does most of the killing, but also provides the most chance for audience sympathy.Lon Chaney Jr returns as Larry Talbot, the Wolf Man, and continues to play the character with aplomb, even in the face of some less than inspired dialog. His tortured soul is the real heart of these monster mashes. Glenn Strange takes his first turn as the Frankenstein monster in nothing more than a cameo, really. He continues the Lugosi tradition of playing the monster as a stiff caricature, far from the original grandeur of the creature.John Carradine takes over the role of Dracula. His look and mannerism are much closer to the Chaney vampire in SON OF Dracula, though I do believe he is supposed to be the original Lugosi bloodsucker. There is, even, a connection to DRACULA'S DAUGHTER in the use of a ring to hypnotize. Carradine does a serviceable job as the vampire in the monster mashes, but he's certainly no Lugosi.After the classic BRIDE OF FRANK, this is probably my favorite of the Universal monster sequels. Not just for the fun of seeing all of your favorite monsters in one movie, but it's an exciting thrill ride with plenty of creepy little scenes to enjoy.

By this point our heroes have begun to show that their is really nothing more that you could do with them. Indeed Universal had hoped that 'House' would mark the end of the series. What we get here is nothing more than a greatest hits compilation of the monsters delivering the same scares in a less stellar fashion. It sounds as if I am disappointed in the film but the truth is I love it because these characters are so iconic and fun. Even in a lesser effort like this one I still have a hell of a good time. Critically though this thing isn't as well directed or told as coherently or has the same pathos. This is all about fun and iconography with Karloff heading the gang of ghouls. Universal made the extremely wise choice to bring back Boris Karloff to headline this picture. It was a brilliant idea and he gives one of the funnest performances of his career. Dr. Niemann is a character Karloff played so well. He mixes that sly quality Karloff did so well with the beastly wild man Karloff could portray. 'House' is filled with monsters but none of them really relish in being evil or ghastly as well as Karloff as Niemann. The opening of the picture with Karloff's character escaping a dungeon is the only moment in the film that has the same mystery and fear of the golden age of horror that inspired these films.J. Carrol Naish is very good as Niemann's friend Daniel, a poor hunchback. Naish is the only member of the cast who revisits the spirit of the classic 'Frankenstein' or even the Lon Chaney pictures. We sympathize with Daniel because Naish shows how the effects of how cruel the perceptions of being different weigh down on a person. There is an absolutely beautiful scene that only a horror film like this could do where Naish's Daniel tries to befriend a gypsy woman and she has no idea about his hunch and even flirts with him. His revelation to here is absolutely heartbreaking. It's my favorite scene in the movie and it has nothing to do with monsters, it's all about humanity. Lon Chaney Jr. is back as Laurence Talbot but he doesn't do anything new with the character. I like his portrayal of the role but this performance is very much in the shadows of what he did with the character in the last film. Talbot isn't given a tangible motivation in the picture. His desire for death was so powerful in the last film that anything here sort of feels like a cop out and less compelling. Part of me vies this film in the shadow of the next installment. If this was how Universal intended to bring the character of Talbot to an end than I think it is a pretty lackluster ending. I for one am glad that 'Dracula's House did a more concrete ending for the character. John Carradine dons the cape as Dracula and you will not find me praising his performance. Carradine is merely serviceable as the Count. He has a certain aura about him but he totally lacks the mysterious romantic quality Lugosi brought to the role. The whole Dracula subplot feels totally unnecessary to tell you the truth. It merely splits the film in two right down the middle. I like the set up but to see Dracula become a slave to Niemann in the hopes that he will offer a sanctuary for his coffin is really some of the weakest stuff this character has been subjugated to. Dracula is resurrected and killed in the course of one evening, I kid you not. How is this character supposed to inspire any terror?Glenn Strange is merely a serviceable monster, the make-up looks great on his face but he lacks any semblance of acting talent. Karloff unfortunately had to see his character fall to the pessimistic prediction he had for him. To tell you the truth though I don't mind almost. The doctor here is much more fun and interesting than the monster.The film also suffers from being directed by a journeyman who really only does a serviceable job with his horror pictures. Erle Kenton brought us in my opinion the least interesting looking of the classic Universal pictures. Everything feels as if it is shot for face value. There are no build up scenes that deal with the atmosphere of the surrounding. I would have loved for Roy William Neill who did 'Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man' to be in the director's chair again.Although the picture lacks substance it is a fun ride. I still rematch it a very deal. Maybe it's nostalgia but I get a kick out of it. At the very least Karloff plays a mean mad doctor.

Instead we get this, and its a great little monster flick, full of all the stuff you have come to expect from universal horror, but damn I wish I could have saw that epic battle I thought this film would show.The film is basically split in two parts. The first half deals with a condensed Dracula story with Dracula being played by John Carradine who, although not as good as Lugosi, brings an understated, menacing evil to the role, his voice is also as smooth as butter. The first half is extremely entertaining and sets up the second half well.The second half deals with Dr. Niemann (played by Boris Karloff) and his hunchback assistant Daniel (played by J. Carrol Naish) on the search for Dr. Frankensteins notes on his experiments. Searching Frankensteins castle they find the preserved bodies of both Larry Talbot (played by Lon Chaney Jr.) and The Monster (played by Glen Strange). From there its pretty standard affair, brain transplants, mad doctors, backstabbing and all that good stuff.The cast all have a nice upbeat energy, like there all happy to be doing the picture. Carradine, Karloff, Chaney and Strange all give great performances (even if Chaneys Talbot is starting to get a little old and tired) and I was especially surprised by Glen Strange, who was coached by Karloff into how to play The Monster properly. The love triangle between Daniel, Larry and Rita is actually a very refreshing thing to see in a Universal Horror film and its a nice diversion from the typical themes these films recycle.Overall, its good campy fun and nothing more, the formula was getting tired for Universal at this point so the fact they still managed to pull off even a decent film is actually pretty good.

A year after Frankenstein Meets The Wolfman (which paired, well, Frankenstein's monster and the Wolfman) the studio decided to throw Count Dracula into the mix as well, and ended up with House of Frankenstein, which features all three of Universal's favourite monsters. (As I understand it, some very early ideas had even more of Universal's monsters being thrown into the script; thankfully, sanity prevailed, and Universal showed that it had at least some shame in sticking with just its three best monsters.)This movie is a bit choppy, to say the least. The three monsters never actually appear together. Dracula is only featured in the first half of the movie. A travelling horror show has acquired his coffin, complete with his skeleton with a stake through the heart. Dr. Niemann (Boris Karloff - no, he wasn't Frankenstein's monster in this) takes possession of the show, revives Dracula by removing the stake from his heart (which also magically recreates Dracula's clothing!) and lets him loose to gain revenge on those who had imprisoned him years before. (As an aside, Dracula just isn't Dracula when he's not Bela Lugosi; here, the part is played - rather weakly, in my opinion - by John Carradine.) Eventually Dracula ends up dead - again - and Niemann and his hunchbacked assistant (played by J. Carroll Naish) move on to Dr. Frankenstein's ruined castle where he wants to recreate Frankenstein's experiments. At the castle, he finds both the Monster (Glenn Strange) and the Wolfman (once again, Lon Chaney, Jr.) frozen in ice (remember the flood at the end of Frankenstein Meets The Wolfman). Not much is really made of Frankenstein's monster until the final few scenes of the movie, but the Wolfman wreaks a bit of havoc before being killed by a silver bullet fired by the Gypsy woman who's fallen in love with him (or at least with Talbot) which caused the hunchback to become very jealous.It's clear by this point that Universal was interested in the monsters themselves more than in creating good and workable stories for them to appear in, which is probably why this particular incarnation of the monster genre (although House of Dracula would follow the next year) was mercifully coming to an end. You can only take even a good thing so far, and if you look at Universal's list of horror movies from the 30's and 40's you can see that they rode these three monsters pretty hard. I suppose that for a war-weary population in 1944 this was a bit of an escape from the all too ugly realities of everyday life.

You couldn't ask for a better cast Boris Karloff as a snarling, unhinged scientist who wants to follow in the footsteps of the infamous Dr. Frankenstein; J. Carrol Naish as his pitiable hunchbacked assistant; Lon Chaney Jr. as the Wolf Man; John Carradine in his first of two appearances as Dracula for Universal Studios; and Glenn Strange as Frankenstein's Monster. While House of Frankenstein seems to move a bit too quickly at times, and Carradine and Strange aren't really given much to do, the viewer is going to have a blast and that's all that matters. To me, it's Karloff who puts this film over the top. (I haven't seen the sequel, House of Dracula, but I would imagine it suffers at least a little from his absence.) The man never delivered a bad performance, and here he really gets to sink his teeth into a juicy villainous role. Naish is also very good; there's something about his eyes that makes it difficult to imagine anyone else playing the lovelorn hunchback. Chaney projects a certain sympathetic quality, too, but he's never been my favorite of the major horror actors of the twentieth century. Carradine is great as a glaring, mustachioed Dracula (though I wish he'd had more screen time), and Strange's gaunt face is the ideal canvas for Jack Pierce's legendary Frankenstein makeup. Minor horror luminaries Lionel Atwill and George Zucco also make brief appearances. Divided more or less evenly into two sections (the first of which focuses on Carradine, the second on Karloff and his simultaneous efforts to resurrect Strange and cure Chaney's lycanthropy), House of Frankenstein was the first of Universal's so-called 'monster rallies'. It's not in the same league as the first two Frankenstein films directed by James Whale, of course, but the presence of top-shelf performers like Karloff and Carradine keeps this film on track.

And let's not forget the European village setting with ruined castles and laboratories. It's all here.The plot is a little confusing and it seems it was stretched a bit to include all of the monsters, but the movie is fast moving, fun and entertaining.Karloff appears, but not as the Monster.

When Dracula fails and Neimann hears about the frozen ruins of The Wolf Man, Larry Talbot, (Lon Chaney Jr.) and Frankenstein's Monster, (Glenn Strange) in a nearby town, they head over to use them in their scheme of revenge.The Good News This is a halfway decent film if really looked at. The fact that all the monsters from before are all seen here in all their glory, and seeing all of them together makes it all the more special. The action scenes in here are it's best feature, with several high-energy and incredibly entertaining sequences. The carriage chase near the beginning is perhaps the best, taking place in very hazardous terrain and being filmed in a high speed camera that keeps it at full attention through the whole affair. The ending conflagration is it's high point, again sending the film out on a real high note. The fact that there's several different transformations on-screen make it a pretty decent and actually look really good for the time. The fact that even Dracula got a transformation helps out the film and makes it not just a series of werewolf transformations. The fact that the film also has a pretty fast pace to it is also welcome, making sure that there's really nothing to keep it from really going along. The film is all forward motion and there was a real feeling of fun. This wasn't all that bad at all.The Bad News There's really only a couple of problems here. The first, and most obvious, is that to all of the creatures get equal time. The Wolf Man and Frankenstein's Monster get the most, and even then there's not a whole lot. Dracula is killed off in the middle of the movie and is hardly brought up again. It's almost like they never really knew what to do with him either, as his scenes are really out of place. There really not used for any real purpose and mostly consist of him trying in vain to act debonair. He could've been written out of the plot quite easily without any real damage done and given more time to concentrate on the other aspects of the story. One that could've been worked on was the kills, as they all take place off-screen or through silhouette. It got a bit old when the same fate kept happening to people over and over again. But beyond these, there's really not a whole lot that seemed off.The Final Verdict While not a full-on monster mash that it's reputation has given it, all the creatures do show up and give their time in here quite nobly. It's decent enough to warrant a look from fans of the Universal series', but be warned if some of the monsters don't get equal time.Today's Rating-PG Violence "}{"Title":"........HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN is to FRANKENSTEIN and BRIDE of FRANKENSTEIN as THE BOWERY BOYS Series is to DEAD END!.....My Own Quotation (Purty Good, Huh?)","Date":"20 April 2008","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" As life speeds along; we find ourselves continually older, grayer and maybe even a little wiser. Most everything in life changes; our tastes, our levels of tolerance, our political and religious philosophies move along as does the length of time we've had a Birth Certificate. Among things in my life that have under gone a steady evolution from youthful point of view to that of middle aged fuddy-duddy are latter day Woody Allen Films and those latter day Universal Pictures Super Cross-over Monster-fests.FRANKENSTEIN MEETS THE WOLFMAN (1943) was the first such team-up of two of Universal's top characters. Owing to the fact that it was fairly successful Box Office and perhaps the movie-going public needed a make-believe horror to take its collective mind off of the real-life horrors of World War II; the suits at the Studio that was home of the Horror Film decided to have another go at it.SO they threw another log on the fire with this HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN (Universal, 1944) and added the presence of Count Dracula to the mix; just to broaden things a little. After determining that Kharis, the Mummy, who had starred in at least 4 post original knock-offs following Karloff in THE MUMMY (Universal, 1932), should be scratched from the Monster Derby; the studio handed the assignment of coming up with a story and eventual script to Curt Siodmak, the German-born writer, who was largely responsible for the pseudo mythology of Lycanthropy (Werwolfism) and the subsequent success of THE WOLFMAN (Universal, 1941).OUR STORY&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;.Working in very quick fashion (there was a lot to cover in considerably less than an hour and a half, 71 minutes to be exact), so there was no wasted time, nor any wasted line that couldn't be used as exposition in reminding us of the facts of the various legends and moving the story along. Dr. Gustav Niemann (Boris Karloff) is doing hard time in a Central European Prison for performing Frankenstein-like experiments. But the Good, Mad Doctor (is there any other kind in these flix?) still plans to escape and continue same.IN the next cell is Daniel, a misshapen and misunderstood lad, who enlists his aid to Niemann's quest. In return the Hunchback is promised some sort of non-existent corrective surgery in return. The Prison Wall is struck open by a bolt of lightening from the opening scene storm. The pair split the prison scene, where the wind up being passengers in Professor Bruno Lampini's traveling Horror Show.Questioning their cockin' bull explanation about being held captive by mountain bandits, Lampini (George Zucco) explains about his prize exhibit, the heart staked skeleton of Count Dracula (John Carradine). Niemann has Daniel kill Lampini and his driver and then Niemann assumes his identity. Reviving the Vampire by removing the stake, they strike a bargain to have Drac bump off some old enemies, like one Burgermeister Hussman (Sig Ruman). Dracula finds Niemann to be no man of honor; as Drac's Coffin, Transylvanian Soil and all, get pitched away in short order, when the Law is in hot pursuit. The Count shrivels-up to his former bony self.The story moves on to the town of the second son of the House of Frankenstein, where he finds Larry Talbot, the Wolfman (Lon Chaney, Jr.) and the Frankenstein Monster still on ice in a subterranean cold (storage) cave. They are added to the troupe along with Gypsy Dancing Girl Ilonka (Elena Verdugo, woo, woo, woo, woo!) They were all off to Niemann's place in Vaseria to do the experiments and be pursued by angry, torch carrying villagers (and this was not an Olympic Year). You can figure out the rest.We don't mean to sound as if we are strictly down on this film, because it is enjoyable as much as we enjoyed B movie series like BOSTON BLACKIE, THE 3 MESQUITERS or THE BOWERY BOYS. And it was certainly good to see Mr. Karloff back in a Frankenstein story. John Carradine's portrayal of Dracula was very good, albeit all too brief. Lon Chaney's Talbot/Wolfman continued his sad, brooding existence to an unprecedented level. J. Carroll Naish was a fine addition to the cast as the Hunchback; but for what he had to do, he could have proverbially phoned in the part.Miss Elena Verdugo was incredibly beautiful in her Gypsy Girl role and displayed acting talents far beyond that needed here. It also appears that Mr. Paul Terry and his crew were also taken by the lovely Miss Verdugo's Gypsy Girl; as the Gypsy Mouse Girl in the Mighty Mouse cartoon, THE GYPSY LIFE (Terrytoons/20th Century-Fox, 1945) appears to have been modeled on her.The cast was rounded out by Sig Ruman, Anne Gwynne, Lionel Atwill and the ever-popular Phil Van Zandt. Yugoslav born Peter Coe was prominently featured as Sig Ruman's grandson & newlywed to Anne Gwynne. He apparently was a viewed as a possible screen heart-throb; but he never did rise to any such level, becoming a character actor for some years. Glenn Strange had the first of three pictures in that part and he reportedly got some tutoring from Mr. Karloff, who of course, originated the role.An interesting theory was advanced by my youngest brother, Bob Ryan of Evanston, Illinois. He wondered if HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN was planned to be done in 3 D. The technology was certainly available and there had been a couple of brief Hollywood flirtations with it over the years. When you take a good look at several of the sets used, you'll find them to be exceptionally deep (and cold!). Deep halls used for laboratories and the very impressive and intricately designed frozen cave give us a real indication of Three Dimensional intent.And there is one close-up of J.

Do you quit while you're ahead artistically, or try to wring out every last cent?  It's pretty clear how Universal executives felt when you look at `House of Frankenstein.'This chapter of the Frankenstein story follows an episodic path.  The tale of Dracula seducing his way into a family works on a short-story level  -- I would have preferred Bela Lugosi as Dracula instead of John Carradine, but everything worked out well.  The second half, the recovery of the Wolf Man and Frankenstein's Monster and the search for Dr. Frankenstein's secrets, goes through its paces faithfully, but the centerpiece of the movie is the tragic romantic triangle between the hunchbacked Daniel (J. Carroll Nash), the beautiful Gypsy, and the suicidal Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney). The actors all do good work Boris Karloff makes his return to the Frankenstein series here playing a mad scientist, which he performs with glee.  J. Carroll Nash's Daniel becomes a sympathetic character, and the girls (Anne Gwynne and Elena Verdugo) are attractive and appealing.  On the other hand there's John Carradine as a not-very-convincing Dracula, Lon Chaney's increasingly tired hysterics as Larry Talbot / The Wolf Man, and Glenn Strange does little as the Frankenstein Monster except lie on a slab and finally get up and lumber around a bit.A big plus `House' features another appearance of the incredibly durable Frankenstein lab equipment, which I always get a kick out of seeing.

In fact, he's barely on, and when he is, all he does is (to quote Lugosi as played by Martin Landau in Ed Wood) roar and growl. Karloff is Dr. Niemann, a mad scientist in prison for robbing graves, vowing revenge on the men who put him there and prevented him from his greatest dream working with the original Dr. Frankenstein. As luck would have it, a bombing unleashes Karloff and his hunchbacked cell mate (J. Carroll Naish) and they take on the disguise of a traveling horror show owner. Among the many treasures of the poor sap they dispatch to take over is the skeleton of Dracula (played here by John Carradine) whom Karloff pledges allegiance to only if he'll help him dispatch his enemies.This is an episodic programmer, the Dracula segment only lasting for the first half, and merging into the return of the Wolf Man (Lon Chaney) and the Frankenstein monster who no longer looks like Lugosi after the previous Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man. There's a sweet romantic triangle involving the hunchback, a gypsy girl, and Chaney's wolf man human counterpart, Lawrence Talbot, and it is one of the silliest plot lines in the series. Elena Verdugo teases Naish until he's insane with lust, driven even further into madness by her obvious attraction to Chaney.

Carrol Naish). They masquerade as travelling sideshow proprietors, and after having to deal with a resurrected Count Dracula (John Carradine), make it to the old Frankenstein castle where Niemann intends to continue Henry F.'s work. He and Daniel discover the bodies of the monster (Glenn Strange, in his first performance in the role) and Larry Talbot (Chaney Jr.), and while Niemann ignores Larry's pleas for help Daniel finds himself falling for an adorable gypsy girl, played by the enchanting Elena Verdugo.Good atmosphere, sets, and music are all assets in this snappily paced horror flick. The excellent cast also includes Anne Gwynne, Lionel Atwill (who's as fun to watch as he's ever been), George Zucco (whose role is unfortunately much too brief), Sig Ruman, Michael Mark, Frank Reicher, and Brandon Hurst. Carradine is good as the Count, Strange doesn't get a lot to do until the last few minutes, and Karloff is a delight as the unscrupulous scientist with the empty promises. However, it's Naish who stands out the most, offering a sympathetic portrayal of a man unlucky in life and love. (It's recommended that viewers check out his similarly affecting performance in Dr. Renault's Secret.)As one can see, the movie does have a rather episodic nature, but the gimmick of the gathering of the Universal horror characters does make this quite diverting, and the movie manages to pack a fair amount of story into its trim 71 minute running time.

Kenton made House of Frankenstein, an efficiently helmed B-movie monster epic that gives Dracula the short shrift. The classic vampire enters the story about eleven minutes into the action and then exits about sixteen minutes later, making only a minimal impression. John Carradine replaced Lon Chaney, Jr., and he makes a more believable aristocratic vampire. Indeed, the Universal executives deserve praise for luring Boris Karloff back to the franchise that made the Englishman a house-hold name, but they neither let Karloff play the eponymous monster nor his insane creator. Naturally, Lawrence Talbot, aka 'the Wolfman,' emerges as the more sympathetic character with the Frankenstein monster running a close second. The best thing about House of Frankenstein is Kenton's no-nonsense approach to the supernatural material. Edmund T. Lowe's screenplay, based on Curt Siodmak's story, abides by most of the conventions and clichés of these franchises. Mind you, Dracula doesn't have to request permission to enter a room. He just walks in, and he can guzzle wine unlike Bela Lugosi's Count.Mad scientist Dr. Gustav Niemann (Boris Karloff of Frankenstein) and his hunchback subordinate Daniel (J. Carroll Naish of Tiger Shark) break out of Neustadt Prison when a violent thunderstorm collapses the prison walls collapse around them. They slip out of their cell through a huge hole in the floor and stumble onto a horse-drawn conveyance bogged down in the rain. Daniel exerts his strength and they get the wagons moving again. The proprietor of Chamber of Horrors, a small potatoes two-wagon circus side-show, invites them to join him in his wagon while the storm rages. Niemann lies to Professor Bruno Lampini (George Zucco of The Black Raven) and says he was kidnapped by mountain bandits and held hostage. In reality, Niemann and Daniel have spent the last fifteen years locked up in a dudgeon because Niemann tried to transplant the brain of a man into a dog! Talk about a mad scientist! Niemann worships Dr. Victor Frankenstein as his idol and assures his dutiful assistant that he can change the hunchback into an Adonis. Lampini points out that he has a singular display in his traveling show that nobody else has. He possesses Count Dracula's coffin and the fangster's skeleton lies in the casket with a stake through his heart. This conversation allows Vampire Bat scenarist Edward T. Lowe to let Lampini and Niemann provide the basic exposition about the limitations that restrict vampires. Meanwhile, Niemann has a score to settle with the man who put him behind bars. He wants Lampini to take them to the town of Reigelberg where he can wreck vengeance on Burgomeister Hussman (Sig Ruman of Desperate Journey) who sent him to prison. Lampini rules out this detour out because Reigelberg has never paid for the trouble it takes him to put on a show. Nevertheless, Niemann insists, and Daniel strangles Lampini and they appropriate his wagons.Newly wedded wife Rita Hussman (Anne Gwynne) convinces his husband Carl (Peter Coe) and his grandfather to accompany them and Inspector Arnz for the Chamber of Horrors show at the crossroads. They attend the show and the Burgomeister recognizes Niemann, but he cannot remember his identity. After the show, Niemann extracts the stake from Dracula's skeleton and strikes a deal with the legendary bloodsucker (John Carradine of The Grapes of Wrath) to maintain his coffin. Dracula agrees to deal with the Burgomeister, and the vampire meets the Hussmans as they are trudging home in the dark from the show. He is riding in a horse-drawn carriage and suggests that they drink wine at his hotel. Instead, the Burgomeister invites Count Latos to join them at his house. Rita notices Dracula's ring and becomes entranced by it. The Burgomeister passes out and Dracula turns into a vampire bat and kills him. Kenton shows the shadow of the vampire bat as it lands on the public official's neck and feasts on it. Afterward, Dracula kidnaps Rita, and Carl summons Inspector Arnz. They set off in hot pursuit of Dracula's coach with Rita inside it. Between Dracula's hypnotic eyes and the ring, Rita cannot resist his charms. The authorities charge after Dracula and their pursuit alarms Niemann and Daniel. Daniel drops Dracula's coffin in the road and Dracula's carriage breaks down and turns over. The sunlight kills Dracula as he scrambles up a slope to enter his coffin. Although Dracula did not get away, Niemann and Daniel do and they wind up a village where they watch a gypsy girl, Ilonka (Elena Verdugo), as she dances. The local authorities break up the celebration because citizens have complained about thieves. When Ilonka threatens to expose Fejos (William Edmunds), he lashes her mercilessly with a whip and Daniel intervenes. The authorities refuse to let Niemann spend the night in town and complain about all the pain and heartache that Victor Frankenstein wrought. Daniel persuades Niemann to allow him to take Ilonka with them, but the girl doesn't know what Daniel looks like. When they arrive at the ruins of the Castle Frankenstein, Niemann and Daniel discover the bodies of the Frankenstein monster (Glenn Strange of TV's Gunsmoke) and Lawrence Talbot encased in the ice.Not surprisingly, Talbot wants Niemann to help him live an ordinary life. Soap operatic elements enter the fray as Illonka falls in love with Talbot to the chagrin of Daniel. However, Niemann is more interested in reviving the Frankenstein monster. Ironically, the monster kills the injured Niemann when he drags him to his death in a swamp. House of Frankenstein is far from memorable but it doesn't wear out its welcome.

Once outside the prison they come upon a traveling show owned by a man named Mr. Lampini (George Zucco) who just happens to have the skeleton of Dracula as one of the items of interest. Anyway, needing to get to the town of Reigelberg in a hurry Dr. Niemann has Daniel kill Mr Lampini and confiscate the wagons. Once they arrive in Reigelberg Dr. Niemann pulls the wooden stake out of the skeleton's ribcage which causes Dracula (John Carradine) to come back to life. But Dr. Niemann doesn't stop there. He later revives both the Wolfman (Lon Chaney Jr.) and the monster known as Frankenstein (Glenn Strange) as well. So in essence this movie features a smörgåsbord of monsters and several other interesting characters all compressed within 71 minutes of film. And therein lies the problem. Not only are there 3 monsters, a mad scientist and a murderous hunchback included in this movie but there is also a love-interest for Dracula named Rita (Anne Gwynne) and a Gypsy dancer by the name of Ilonka (Elena Verdugo) all competing for time and there simply wasn't enough available film to do them all justice. In short, because of the lack of depth given to many of these characters the movie seemed much too thin and hollow. As such I rate it as slightly below average.

A violent storm and a bolt of lightning proceed to destroy the prison walls, opening up a tunnel for them to escape. They then find a travelling showman with a wagon called House of Horrors, which is a sideshow attraction. The man owning the wagon Lampini, I know a stereotypical sideshow hawker, claims to own the remains of the Count Dracula with a stake right through his heart. Strangely, they all believe Lampini, but Hey this is Hollywood! Dr. Neihman asks Lampini if he can take them to the town where the mayor convicted him of his inhumane experiments. When Lampini refuses, The Hunchback kills Lampini, and the Doctor steals the wagon and his costume. They then proceed to travel to the town where he was convicted, his goal is to kill the Mayor, what he doesn't know is the mayor knows the real Lampini. The mayor knows that the Doctor isn't Lampini, and when the show ends, The Doctor in revenge takes the stake from Count Dracula's heart! Then begins the cheesy 40's special effects of the skeleton turning back into Dracula. John Carradine is Dracula in the film, and what a great actor! The Doctor tells Dracula to kill the mayor or he will destroy him when he's in his coffin. That night Dracula, with a fake name, befriends the Mayor and his daughter and fiancée. He then, of course, puts the girl in a trance, and turns into a bat and kills the Mayor. To top that off he kidnaps the girl. Then he gets in his coach and races away.But the sun is coming and you know what that means to a vampire. But Lampini doesn't want people to think that he's tied to Dracula, so he throws the coffin out of the house of horrors wagon, Dracula starts turning into his skeleton, and to the expense of terrifying the entire police possee. That ends the first episode of this movie, Yeah the movie is a little chopped up, the second have doesn't have much to do with the first half. I don't want to completely give away the movie, but to make a long story short, The Doctor and The Hunchback go to the ruins of the Frankenstein castle in search for Dr. Frankensteins long lost book the Secret of Life and Death. While searching they literally stumble upon The Frankenstein Monster and The Wolfman, who are petrified in ice after the fight they had in a previous movie of Universals Frankenstein Meets The Wolfman. They defrost the monster and the wolfman, and that's when the movie starts getting really interesting and confusing. I would like to leave that up to you to watch. The movie is good. I am going to rate this comparing it to other Universal horror movies. In all reality I give it 6 out of 10 ******This movie was a little more low-budget then other Frankenstein or Dracula films, not a whole lot of action. And of course Bela Lugosi isn't Dracula and Boris Karloff isn't Frankenstein, he's the doctor.

If you're looking for a great story or masterful performances then it would be best to stick with FRANKENSTEIN or BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN but if you're looking for B movie entertainment then this here offers up some. The story is pretty basic as the mad scientist (Boris Karloff) and his hunchback assistant (J. Carrol Naish) hire Dracula (John Carradine) to knock off some people but things don't go as planned. In the second half of the film the doctor and hunchback come across Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney, Jr.) and the Frankenstein monster (Glenn Strange) and plan on an operation to cure both. HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN is without question a few steps down from the previous films in the series as you can tell things are rushed and there's really no desire to write deep characters or anything else. You could spend days talking about some of the bad stuff here but in the ends it's still just 69-minutes worth of mindless fun. There's no question that the film plays out like three different short films just thrown together and there's no question that Dracula really doesn't get used very well. I thought the fifteen-minutes of his story was well filmed and contained some great atmosphere but it's just over way too soon. The second half of the film contains more action and more monsters, which is a good thing. The Talbot role here isn't nearly as heartfelt as in the previous films as some of his complaints were growing old by now. Chaney still gives it his all in the role as does Strange in his few scenes as the monster. Karloff is pretty much himself, which is always a good thing and Carradine is very good as Dracula. In recent years there's been a cult of fans who claim Carradine to be better than Lugosi but I wouldn't go that far. We even get George Zucco and Lionel Atwill (his fourth Frankenstein film in a row) showing up in brief spots. The main reason the film works so well is because of Naish and his hunchback character. He's certainly the heart and soul of the film and you can't help but feel bad for the character just like you did Talbot in earlier films. HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN isn't a masterpiece but there's no denying the charm of having all these monsters together even if the screenplay didn't use them in the best way.

Neimann's goal is to revive the Frankenstein monster and revenge himself on those who stopped him last time, so things definitely are coming up roses for him.Erle C. Kenton's direction shows flashes of interesting ideas. The walls of Dr. Neimann's cell are covered in arcane formulae (why he wants that chalk) and an early murder scene is cleverly positioned so that we see Daniel coming right at us, followed by a deft camera move that zeroes in on Neimann's contented visage.But the film loses such vitality when it pulls away from Neimann to focus on the first of the two monster subplots, this regarding Dracula (John Carradine). Neimann employs Dracula to avenge himself on one of his old adversaries, but Dracula, being Dracula, falls for a woman. A long romantic melodrama of exposition and ensnarement ensues, which Carradine plays with all the conviction of someone who had three other films to shoot that afternoon.The second monster subplot features Neimann's discovery of both the Frankenstein monster (Glenn Strange) and the Wolfman (Lon Chaney Jr.), covered in ice. While Frankenstein remains frozen stiff almost until the closing credits, the Wolfman is thawed out, much to the interest of a fetching Gypsy girl Daniel desires.This plot is even weaker than the Dracula one, with the horror elements pushed aside in favor of a goony love triangle that leave Neimann on the sidelines fondling his Frank-sicle. The girl makes cow eyes at the Wolfman while Daniel makes cow eyes for her. J. Carroll Naish overplays the pity here, to the point you just want him to suffer for being such a dork.I can't figure out why anyone who enjoyed the earlier Frankenstein movies would hold this in the same regard. It's a pale imitation, labored in its attempt to cram everything it can in 70 minutes to squeeze the juice from this once-great franchise. In the process, it degrades the monsters to the point of unrecognizability.House Of Frankenstein left the Universal monsters in such a state it required the services of a couple of comics, Abbott & Costello, to save them. There at least, the silliness would be intentional.

The whole movie is a screenplay mess about unrelated monster sub-plots gotten together by the main plot of a mad runaway scientist who wants to emulate Frankenstein, and his hunchback assistant lured unwillingly into it because the scientist promised he could make him whole.Too bad poor hunchback falls in love with a gypsy lovely who at first seems to like him, but (obviously) falls madly in love with Lawrence Talbot, the wolfman de-frozen together with the frankenstein monster.Carradine is laughable as Dracula & his mimic belongs better to a ridicule spoof like Naked Gun or Police Academy.then the plot goes astray...the mad scientist wants Talbot's body for...the brain of the monster...the hunchback gets mad because he's still in a queue and tries to kill the doctor; then the monster kills him and the gypsy girl is killed by the wolfman but manages a desperate shooting with a silver bullet she had prepared to rid Talbot of his curse.in the end ( as usual ) a mob of villagers with lit torches assaults the house and the monster & the dying doctor sink into quicksands.a token from the silver screen era, but very, very average overall. "},{"Title":"pretty bad","Date":"2 March 2004","Score":"3 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":"  This movie features not only Frankenstein but also the wolf man and Dracula. It stars out with Boris Karloff in jail with his assistant who is a hunchback and the walls all of a sudden just come crashing down. They escape and run into a traveling show of horrors and he kills the owner and takes his place. Karloff wants to find Dr. Frankenstein's notes on how he created Frankenstein so he can get revenge or something like that. The first creature you see is Dracula, played by John Carradine, who doesn't do a very good job. He's taken out of the picture pretty quick and Karloff is only interested in getting revenge on two men who sent him to jail. The hunchback falls in love with a gypsy but after they find the wolf man, played by Lon Chaney Jr, and Frankenstein, she falls for Lon Chaney instead. Their is more to the plot but you can find it out for yourself.

Boris Karloff plays an escaped convict/scientist who, for reasons unexplained by the film, wants to switch the brains of the Frankenstein monster with the Wolf Man. Why? Who cares? Does the curse of the Wolf Man effect the body, but not the brain? And why would anyone want the Frankenstein monster to come back to life? I guess it doesn't matter anyway since the monster never even walks! And what's with the whole beginning sequence with Dracula? It takes up about half of the movie and doesn't really have anything to do with anything!I've always been a fan of the Universal monster movies, but I think this one is the absolute worst of them all! I've seen Dracula's Daughter, The Mummy, Werewolf of London, I've even seen Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man (which wasn't that bad), but this one is worse than all of them! What ever you do, don't see this movie! "}]
