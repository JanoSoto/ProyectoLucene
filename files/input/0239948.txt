I am a 58-yr-old well-educated woman, so go figure...I just HOWLED at this movie, I had tears running down my face. Haven't laughed this much and so unexpectedly since Rodney Dangerfield's antics in 'Back to School'.  The sight gags were dead on, the whole premise of the loser worshippers of N. Diamond was hysterical and milked to perfection, and the send-up of misogyny was perfectly done. Actually, these three hapless fools were just perfectly pathetic and loveable in their own ways.  The acting was wonderful....Amanda Peet was wickedly funny, and all three male stars were equally crass and deliciously low-down. Jack Black as usual was unnervingly disgusting and real. Neal Diamond was a wonderful parody of himself, without being condescending...he fit the spirit of the movie to a 'T'. The ending was great, reminiscent of the 'feel good' ending of 'Back to School'. Whenever I feel blue, I watch this movie and just can't help laughing. Maybe it just wasn't British humor (referring to the previous review), but this is FUNNY stuff.

First of all the movie has 4 top stars, Jason Biggs, Jack Black, Steve Zahn & Amanda Peet who are all hilarous in their own way, Black & Zahn do stand out the most they are ridiculously funny. I've seen this movie about 5 times and i never get sick of it. I don't really wanna go into details about the movie just to let everyone know that this movie is better than your average comedy. In Australia & some other countries this movie is known as  Evil Woman so don't be confused about the different names.

Jack Black & Steve Zahn are two of the funniest actors working today (and, I guess, Jason Biggs isn't so bad), and they carry this movie. There are so many funny jokes and situations, this movie truly is one of my favorite stupid (as opposed to intelligent, I guess) comedies. But please, oh please, if you plan on seeing this, you MUST get the R-rated DVD version, not the PG-13 one that was released in theaters and on most VHS copies. There are so many funny jokes and moments cut out of the PG-13, you'd be doing yourself a disservice. It's still funny, but you miss some good stuff.Comingtoyaaaahaaaa...

Another part I laughed at was when Wayne gave Darren (Jason Biggs) all those shocks. Those parts were laugh-out-loud funny!

Was this film good on paper?  Did it look funny at the time?  I don't know.  I'm not even sure if it is possible for this film to look good in any form.  I was intrigued by the trailer, it looked damn funny and the principal players in the film are all actors that I like.  Amanda Peet has a great resume of smaller films such as Body Shots, Playing By Heart, Whipped and She's The One.  All films that I loved.  Jack Black thrilled me with his comic genius in High Fidelity.  Steve Zahn was irritatingly likable in Out of Sight and of course Jason Biggs was awesome in American Pie.  Hey, I even admire a lot of Neil Diamonds music and I am one of the few people that liked The Jazz Singer.  So how did this movie get so bad?  That is simple.  It starts with making Judith ( Amanda Peet ) such a bitch!  Seriously, that is all that did it for me.  Not to mention the fact that the film wasn't funny but when you have a film that is predicated on showing how one friend falls madly in love with a woman and abandons his friends, you had better give a good reason as to why he is expunging himself from his friends of 20 years.  You can't just have a hot chick come into one man's life reason enough to turn it upside down.  There has to be reasons.  This film doesn't give any reasons.Jason Biggs plays Darren Silverman as a romantic at heart.  His two best friends are apparent losers that do nothing in life except party and listen to Neil Diamond songs.  The three also have a Neil Diamond cover band.  They are close buds.  Then one day, Judith walks into a bar.  She is beautiful but crass and rude.  Eventually her and Darren hook up and he is in love with her.  He falls in love with her because she makes him masturbate instead of making love to her.  She makes him abandon his friends of 20 years, she forces him to quite the band that he loves, she makes him take relationship counseling, she orders him around, she makes him wear a beeper so that she can have him at her beck and call, she tells his friends that Darren is her puppet and that she is the puppet master, she tells him what he can drink on the very first day that she meets him and she makes him burn all of his Neil Diamond records.  There is no growth of this woman into the mind control freak that she is.  She is just a bitch from the moment that Darren lays eyes on her.  How could anyone fall for someone like that?  I know many guys that have been in love with many different beautiful woman but not one of them has ever been as nasty as Judith is and hence not one guys has ever had to live his life like he is in a convent.Another problem with the film is the lack of comedy.  As I said earlier, Black and Zahn have shown before that they are plenty capable of comedy.  But as much as they try here, it falls flat.  I don't think that is their fault, it is the script that they are working with.  Black has a few parts that look as if they are going to be funny but you are waiting for a payoff that never comes.Saving Silverman is one of the worst movies I have seen in about a year.  There was a romance that came out last year called Here On Earth starring Biggs' American Pie buddy Chris Klein and Leeleeleelee Sobieski that was so bad and so inept that I measure all bad films against that one.  While this one isn't quite as bad, it is close.  I wonder if this is a pattern with the boys from American Pie.  Are they all going to make sucky movies for quite some time?  If these two films are any sort of barometer for the hopeful success they are praying for, things don't look to good.There is one plus for the film.  Amanda Detmer looks good.  That is it.1 out of 10-- half being for Detmer and the other half because it wasn't as bad as Here One Earth.

But it's not a clunker either. For what it is, it's a very enjoyable, occasionally hilarious movie pretty much guaranteed to give anyone a good time.Movie history (especially in the 1930s) is littered with small comedy films that were never meant to be critical, award winning films but made for audiences that wanted to laugh like We're Not Dressing and any number of WC Fields' films (Fields' Million Dollar Legs seems very similar in tone to Saving Silverman). Unpretentious, funny and entertaining films and Saving Silverman falls squarely into that category. It's dopey but harmless and frequently charming. All of the actors are in-synch and none of them hold back especially Amanda Peet as the woman from hell. She's beautiful and you can completely understand why Darren would fall for her the way he does. Peet's willingness to give it her all (especially at the end) is key to the movie working as well as it does. Any vanity on her part would've sunk the already flimsy premise but she goes into it wholeheartedly. Peet's not given enough credit here.Yes, Black and Zahn are great. That pretty much goes without saying. Biggs is well cast but he's essentially playing a male victim. The role is largely just his puzzled reactions. Last but not least is Amanda Detmer as Sandy in a role straight out of 1930s comedy the good, down to earth girl who ever so slightly off her rocker (but in a good appealing way). R. Lee Ermey rounds out the cast in a silly but memorable role. Who would've thunk that the uber-intimidating drill sergeant from Full Metal Jacket would turn out to be one of the most reliable character actors around?Saving Silverman is a simple, funny little film. Not great but it was not made to be.

Abroard, i think to Mr. Bean (english) and i can find also a real funny American show (Married with children). But, right now, to find American movies where i laugh a lot is difficult except maybe those with Chevy Chase and this one! I don't say here that American movies don't make me laugh i just say that they can't make me laugh all along. So this one is a little surprise and i thank Amanda for her choice. In this movie, she plays a sexy bad girl, which are two new things for her. She is surrounded by an excellent cast that leaves for one time the support roles for the big stage (Zahn, Detmer and Ermey). The movie is great because it builds upon a truth what happen to friends when one got married? Again, i don't think this idea has been used a lot of times and here, it is played with genius the script is silly but never fails into craziness in spite of it's not easy to walk on this thin line. In addition, the action takes places in a sweet town at the ocean so the exterior are refreshing.

Everything from the scripting, the acting and direction was first rate.  Jason Biggs was a great choice for playing Darren Silverman.  Jack Black was hilarious in his role as was Steve Zahn.  But the real star here was Amanda Peet.  I think Amanda Peet is one of the sexiest and possibly the best comedic actress in the business.  I was a little disappointed by the movie &#145;Whipped', although I did not think it was her fault.  That particular script had many problems in my opinion.  But &#145;Saving Silverman' did not have those problems.  This cast seemed to be a cut above, and it was just a much more funny plot.

Okay, it's not all good, so let's get that out of the way. First of all, even though it's totally essential the Sandy subplot is pretty bothersome. Especially if it causes Jason Biggs to perform really bad sitcom material involving electrodes on his nipples. That scene was totally wrong for this movie, it seemed taken from some pilot episode that never got to be an actual show for this scene alone. It was embarrassing to sit through. There's also a totally random use of flashbacks throughout, dear God just tell us what happened and get it over with, it's not like any of those flashbacks contains a good joke or something. However, as the movie progresses the material does get better and Steve Zahn and Jack Black deliver like they've never delivered before. They have the on-screen chemistry of a classic comedy duo, only a lot more disturbed. Either way, Evil Woman (what kind of title is Saving Silverman?) is a movie that made me laugh in all its weirdness(an R.Lee Ermey cameo!) and it looks ever so charming. Unexpectably good.

Lee Ermey There is much to save Silverman from when considering the screenplay he is in. He is being saved from a dominating relationship and the fading friendship of two males. Silverman and his two buddies are introduced but Amanda Peet possesses ownership of him. When he announces his engagement they kidnap Peet and struggle to set him up with an ex-girlfriend. Typical and predictable with director Dennis Dugan doing better than average. He previously made the pathetic Problem Child and the horrible Happy Gilmore. Jason Biggs is typecast as the unsympathetic wimp Silverman who can do nothing but wimp out and cave in every time Peet threatens to withhold sex. Peet is given the overbearing personality of a lawn mower. Jack Black and Steve Zahn are the film's only saving graces as Silverman's deadbeat friends who kidnap Peet then suffer in their inability to keep her contained. Much of this is forced humour with laughs that are far and few between. R. Lee Ermey plays a role similar to his Full Metal Jacket performance yet somehow he comes off as much more funny in that serious film. It isn't a new feeling when friends grow distant due to other relationships but unfortunately this theme fails to materialize effectively just like this lanky screenplay.

So I picked Saving Silverman.From the first second until the last moment of the film, I was getting more and more haunted by the thought I was never going to sleep again. This movie was so bad from the beginning, I could describe it as torture! Who can I sue for this??The acting. Yeah let's start with the acting. Amanda Peet -who I normally love to watch, was painfully sad to watch. It reminded me of me and my friends in a school play called Panic in the tunnel -which was part of this gay oriented saga of ours, where people would end up in awkward situations and start to f**k each other. We were ten years old.Steve Zahn and Jack Black were almost okay I guess, but they were just themselves. And their normal routine was not good enough for me. Jason Biggs, oh God I hate that f*****g guy now more than ever. You know I think everyone has this one or two actors they just can't stand? For me it's J.Biggs. He was horrible. So horrible! I'm crying right now...The plot (no spoilers)So stupid. And I really love stupid comedy! Poop jokes, fine by me. People playing retarded people, well okay let's see how it goes.

Zahn (from `That Thing You Do' among others) has an everyman kind of genial good nature that makes his presence welcome and comfortable. Peet has a smooth, marble surface that fully complements her quietly domineering persona and she should do whatever she can to exploit it. (Her turn at likability in the awful `The Whole Nine Yards' proved her limitations in that regard.) The film itself has its funny moments and there are some clever lines here and there (it's written by Hank Nelkin and Greg DePaul) with an intention to appeal to an older audience too mature for `American Pie'.

Whoever deemed the body in the car crash unidentifiable has obviously never heard of a thing called dental records. J.D's obsession with food gets really old really fast.

However, there are quite a few good laughs in the movie, due in no small part to the excellent comedic acting of Jack Black and Steve Zahn. You already know that Jack Black is going to be funny, if only because of his side-splitting performance in High Fidelity. Steve Zahn is even less of a leading man than Black, but he's just got this look and this demeanor that makes his lines in the film even funnier (`I'm hit! I need backup&#133;'). And Jason Biggs gives yet another performance that made me want to yank my hair out every time he was onscreen, making it almost comically ridiculous that he was cast as the `romantic' of the three guys. Amanda Peet, on the other hand, is beautiful in the film and is perfectly cast as the manipulative girlfriend.Wayne (Zahn), J.D. (Black), and Darren (Biggs) have been best friends since fifth grade, and one day that are at a bar participating in their usual drunken activities when Wayne sees a hottie across the bar and decides to try to set Darren up with her. It's never explained why a psychologist of such astronomical self-adoration is sitting at such a seedy bar by herself, but such trivial things are not expected to be explained in a comedy like this. This is how Darren meets Judith, who initially expresses no interest in him at all other than to get him away from her table, but after a bald magician hits on her, she tells him that Darren is her boyfriend, and this `relationship' continues until they are engaged to be married.(spoilers) In Jason Biggs's defense, he filled his role fairly well, but only because he comes across as such a complete moron that it's believable that he would be the kind of guy that would allow a woman to walk all over him in a relationship the way Judith does, and to alienate his best friends while she's at it. I don't know the guy in real life, but he has one of the most idiotic screen personalities that I've ever seen. Wayne and J.D. gradually begin to notice that Darren has ditched them for Judith, and they begin to devise ways to get his friendship back. They start off with simple things like Asking Her Nicely, but ultimately end up kidnapping Judith and faking her death, in a botched abduction that makes up some of the funnier parts of the movie.There are some unnecessary jokes made about sexual orientation, and a lot of ill-used actors (R.Lee Ermey has fallen a long way from the spectacular days of Full Metal Jacket, where he played a role that was so good and so effective that it probably typecast him and badly damaged his career), as well as a cheesy obsession by all three guys with Neil Diamond, but there is some real comedy here. It's too bad about that idiotic ending involving Ermey and Black, but the antics of Wayne and J.D. as they attempt to get Darren back are almost endlessly amusing (`Judith escaped!' `Der!'), and Neil Diamond himself adds significantly to the film, if only in the form of his excellent singing. However, it seems strange that such a respectable musician would lend his timeless songs to such a goofball comedy, but he played a good role.Saving Silverman is one of those rare comedies where the theatrical trailer is nearly as funny as the movie itself, but still doesn't defeat the purpose of watching the film. Other movies like Scary Movie 1 and 2 and American Pie show nearly all of the funny parts in the preview (due to a pathetic lack), and then you spend the entire film waiting for something funny that you didn't see in the preview, and wondering why people around you are laughing at something that they've probably seen 5 or 6 times already (the problem with watching as many movies as I do, as I've said once before, is that I see these previews sometimes 10-15 times before the movies are even released, a problem that made movies like Coyote Ugly even more unendurable than they already were).This is obviously not a real thinker of a film, but if you compare it to its peers (the Scary Movies, American Pie, Road Trip, any movie that Jason Biggs has been in, for crying out loud), Saving Silverman is definitely one of the best. It's almost painful to watch Biggs in the kissing scenes (because when he kisses a girl in the movie it looks like he's trying to swallow her face), and you just want to smack him when he takes Judith back after returning from the dead, abandoning the much more attractive Sally while he's at it, but the film as a whole is not entirely disappointing. Taken for what it is, Saving Silverman can provide for an enjoyable evening when you just want something to entertain you. Watch it for the excellent comedy provided by Jack Black and Steve Zahn as well as the quality Neil Diamond soundtrack, and best of luck in putting up with Jason Biggs.

An hour after the film started, I looked down at my watch and realized that we had only been there for 15 minutes. Yes, it's that bad. It was so bad, it wasn't even bad enough to be good.  And I tried so hard to like it. I even laughed a couple of times.  But there were so many more times when I figured I was supposed to be laughing and wasn't.  There was no chemistry whatsoever between the actors, and a lot of good talent was thoroughly wasted.  Even Neil Diamond (who appears in the film as himself) puts in a lackluster performance.  Not that he has much of a career left to destroy, but if anything could put the final nail in the coffin, this would be it.  I'm not even about to try to explain the plot, just the thought makes my brain hurt. Let's just say that it starts with three buddies who are members of a Neil Diamond tribute band.  It gets worse.

Saving Silverman flies in the face of logic by using its 90 minutes to bravely answer that question.  Characters trip over curbs, crash down stairs, plummet out of windows, fall off bridges, and demolish automobiles from great heights.  One might reasonably assume that director Dennis Dugan discovered the existence (and great juvenile fun) of gravity while making this film. One might also argue that Saving Silverman is an entertaining descendent of The Three Stooges or Abbott and Costello, just another in that long  and glorious line of movies celebrating physical slapstick.  I am not one of those people. The story, in brief (** AND YES, THERE ARE POTENTIAL SPOILERS TO FOLLOW **) Boy meets girl.  girl turns out to be castrating, cold-hearted dominatrix and makes boy give up his friends.  Boy's friends kidnap girl.  Hilarity ensues. Watching this movie, I wasn't sure whether to feel sorry for the actors, or be angry at them for prostituting their talent for a quick paycheck.  Jack Black and Steve Zahn, so terrific in High Fidelity and Happy, Texas, respectively, are merely recycling those characters here without any discernible attempts at, you know, a little thing like believable human behavior.  Amanda Peet, all ditzy-cool in The Whole Nine Yards, plays Judith, a character whose lack of any human emotion other than anger (and, briefly, arousal) is so central to the movie's plot that it deserved to be dealt with in a more prominent fashion than with a kooky flashback that is distinctive only because it probably managed to offend both Asians *and* kickboxers.  Jason Biggs, as the victimized Darren, oozes puppy-dog charm, but like his buddies Black and Zahn, this is too similar to what we've seen him do before in American Pie and Loser.  And Neil Diamond ... well, what can one possibly say about Neil Diamond?  This is surely the finest cameo by a musician since Jerry Cantrell of Alice in Chains played the Kinko's clerk in Jerry Maguire. The problem - as difficult as it is to choose just one - rests with the screenplay.  We're supposed to believe that Darren is madly in love with Judith, that he's willing to marry her, that he'd give up his friends for her, and yet we never see one moment of interaction between the two of them that would in any way suggest the relationship could possibly be worth enough to Darren to give up all he previously held dear.  There isn't even, to be completely crass, a sexual relationship to speak of.  What we're expected to believe is that Judith is beautiful, and therefore Darren will put up with her nagging, yelling, haranguing, and constant criticism; he'll turn his back on the friends he's had since elementary school; he'll quit the band he loves; he'll even endure - wait for it - buttock implants.  I'm all for the suspension of disbelief, but I was afraid if I suspended mine to the extreme this movie requires, I might never get it back. By the end of the film, when Zahn's character Wayne slugs Judith to comic effect (are you laughing as hard as I am?), I wasn't sure whether this was a movie that was supposed to point to males as being dopey fools for a beautiful face, or a misogynistic piece of slop masquerading as a feel-good comedy where everyone ends up with his / her true love.  If it had been the former, I might have been willing to give Saving Silverman the benefit of the doubt. Unfortunately, I couldn't help feeling that Dugan, along with writers Hank Nelken and Greg DePaul, had a toolshed full of axes to grind with some beautiful women in their pasts, and we're privileged enough to get to watch their psychotherapy play out on the big screen.Saving graces for people who have to see something because Hannibal was sold out R. Lee Ermey is funny as R. Lee Ermey, Amanda Detmer has a not-quite-obnoxious perkiness to her as Darren's high school crush, and Neil Diamond doesn't sing You Don't Bring Me Flowers.  Too bad those three things couldn't offset the crime against humanity embodied by the zany cursing nuns.  And to think they're predicting *really* bad movies if the writers and actors go on strike later this year.  I'm going to start building my bomb shelter in preparation ...

SS is filled with asinine humor and stale punch lines surpassed only by its phenomenally atrocious continual dialog.My first instincts were-this is going to blow big monkey chunks- then I saw a pretty funny preview. Um, first instinct was right on! This is truly the worst moving I have suffered through in months.The story goes...Darren Silverman (Jason -what is this boy's appeal?-Biggs) has found his dream girl. Snouty Judith-not Judy (Amanda Kiss of Box Office Death Peet)! He becomes the quintessential do- boy who drops his juvenile friends and tries to be everything the uber bitch wants.Dream witch Judith is a completely un-likable- un-redeemable- hoity toity- stuck up-bad dressing- snob to the tenth power. Written by women haters no doubt. Silverman's idiotic buddies she's so hell bent on excluding, J.D ( Jack I usually don't suck this bad- honest Black) and Wayne (Steve  don't hold this against me Zahn) try to like her- but simply insult her and shock her. They upset her to the point were she gives her pet, er, beau Silverman an ultimatum - no sex-(with himself, as she doesn't even do him ) if he ever sees these friends again.Okay. The friends are superduperpooper moronic and quite frankly losable- but making someone give up their friends is hint numero uno you may need to exit stage left from this relationship. That and her no sex policy...What exactly is this boy getting from her? He's a non practicing pussy-whipped geek.The borderline special friends decide to kidnap the bitch, lock her in their suburban garage (ungagged) , and pretend she's driven off a cliff---that's hysterical no? Argh...it's just too pathetic to even go on.But, just when you thought it certainly couldn't possibly be more odious-like a bad infomercial, there's MORE. The three boys are crazy for Neil Diamond. They stalk him, idolize him, and (gasp) have a band Diamonds in the Rough that do covers of all Neil's hits for penny's in the guitar case. Joke over kill sets in fast-thusly ruining any redeeming factor this shtick would/could have had.Amanda Peet has been in nothing but sucky movies. What's with this girl? Is she the Alec Baldwin of our generation? Hmm.The cast bit the ecoli-ridden - NYC vendor - hot dog, the premise stunk like month old Kao Poa Chicken forgotten in the vegetable tray and the dialog was simply barfed up onto the screen before us. AVOID THIS. The movie's poster is some sort of inside studio joke for sure-a warning if you will. Because the thumbs down image really says it all...Though it should actually be a huge warty hairy thumbs down image.

Bio-Dome and Black Sheep to name a few. I actually think I like Bio-Dome a lot more since I've seen it countless times. But it really doesn't deserve the rating of a good movie. It's completely idiotic, and just because I like it because I like slapstick features, I can't recommend it to a movie-goer who wants to go see a good film. Same thing goes with Saving Silverman. I laughed a lot and about five times out loud. But I like this kind of humor. To recommend it wouldn't be the right thing to do. What I find humorous and what you find humorous are two completely different levels of humor.When released in theaters, the MPAA gave Saving Silverman a PG-13 rating. When released on DVD, two separate ones were issued; one with the PG-13 rating (the theatrical cut) and one with the R rating (the director's cut). This is a review of the R rated print a friend gave to me a few months ago. I remember catching the PG-13 cut of the film on Comedy Central around 2004. I watched some scenes, laughed, but never desired to watch the full feature length film with the PG-13 rating.Say you go to a bakery and find twenty chocolate brownies for ten dollars. Then there are twenty double stuffed chocolate brownies for the same price right next to the twenty regular brownies. Anyone would buy the double stuffed. Especially for the same price as the regular brand. Same goes with a DVD. If there's the R rated version next to Unrated version, and they are the same price, nine times out of ten, the consumer will buy the Unrated version to get the extra material. Basically; I wanted to see what the R rated version was and I waited out to fulfill my dream.I've done the research and realized that the R rated version of the film is six minutes longer than the PG-13 one. Not seeing the full PG-13 cut, or really remembering the scenes I saw when I was younger, I can't really say what's different. Probably a few scenes added in with nudity and some more pervasive language. That's all we need.The movie focuses on three lifelong friends who constantly look out for each other. The three are J.D. (Black), Wayne (Zahn), and Darren (Biggs). All three are in a band, and enjoy doing, you know, guy things like watching football and hanging out. Their band breaks up when Darren meets Judith (Peet), a selfish and demanding girl who changes the person Darren is by preventing him to hang out with his friends and goes on to dictate his proper behavior. Darren, blinded by Judith's beauty, will do anything for her even if he is getting nothing in return.I'm sure this has happened to some friendships when one man becomes married, but J.D. and Wayne devise a kidnapping plan and decide to keep Judith held up in the garage. When they ask their old football coach (Ermey) what they should do he replies simply and simplistically kill her. Maybe because the crew didn't want to think of anything more elaborate or maybe the direction of this movie is supposed to be dark, but for whatever reason the film somehow thinks it's funny to see these idiots who can barely take care of themselves try to conduct a murder.The humor is hit or miss. Some jokes are funny, some jokes can be tiresome. One of my favorite scenes is when Wayne reties Judith up and she replies by kicking him. Wayne is at a loss for words and points his finger at her and says DON'T! like he's talking to his dog. I don't why, but I found that scene very funny. I didn't get too many laughs out of the goofy and Chris Farley wannabe performance Jack Black was putting on, but Jason Biggs was the biggest highlight of the film.I found the ending to be awkward and a little unexpected, but I think sometimes comedies are supposed to catch us off guard. I liked some of the scenes more than others, but buy the hour mark I grew restless and I grew a little fatigued. It isn't a bad comedy, but it certainly needed a few more laughs to get a bigger recommendation.Starring Jason Biggs, Jack Black, Steve Zahn, and Amanda Peet. Directed by Dennis Dugan.

But for what it is, it's still a engaging comedy that doesn't try to be more than what it is. Well the story is very absurd and a bit psychotic actually very psychotic. It's about 3 best friends since 5th grade one being more normal than the other two, anyways they are big time Neil Diamond fans. And they liked do everything together, while acting like complete retards. But than one of there friend Darren Silverman(Jason Biggs) decide to get married to the hot and attractive but domineering psychologist Judith Fessbeggler(Amanda Peet), instead of the two friends being happy for him, they are not very pleased since she takes over his life to the point that he doesn't really hang out with the 2 other best friends anymore. So the 2 friends conspire a plan to kidnap Judith and hook him up with another girl, who is a catholic nun(Amanda Detmer). So yes this is a pretty dumb comedy, but it's still funny with it's messed up humor. Jack Black and R. Lee Erme was okay, and Jack Black wasn't that annoying even if he does what he does best with just about every movie he is in.

Not content with merely embarrassing its likable, youthful cast &#150; Jason Biggs, Steve Zahn, Jack Black and Amanda Peet among others &#150; the film finds it necessary to humiliate Neil Diamond as well, since the story revolves around a trio of boyhood chums so socially backward that they think it's `cool' to play in a band that covers old Diamond standards while decked out in early-70's regalia.   Diamond, for reasons unbeknownst to the rest of us, shows up in the film's later stretches to make a complete and utter fool of himself.Not that the rest of the cast fares much better.  The plot is basically a hodgepodge of laboriously contrived comic situations strung together in a haphazard fashion, with each one falling flatter than the one that came before.  Neither the verbal nor the physical humor works in the slightest.   R. Lee Ermey, as the boys' psychotic coach, offers promise early on that his character will actually manage to elicit some laughs from the viewer, but he is soon reduced to the kind of over-the-top buffoonish caricature that kills all hope of comic effectiveness.  And so it goes with the rest of the film.  Director Dennis Dugan simply lacks the kind of discipline necessary to keep this sort of manic comedy under control - and writers Greg DePaul and Hank Nelken have given him precious little of quality to work with. Put bluntly, `Saving Silverman' is one of the worst, most utterly painful movie comedies to come along in many years.

You can't take this movie seriously, though.  This movie would not be good for anyone who though Gladiator deserved its academy award.  You have to suspend disbelief and enjoy the off-the-wall humor that ensues.10/10 "},{"Title":"I DON'T NORMALLY COMMENT ON MOVIES UNLESS I TRULY FEEL ONE WAY ABOUT IT...","Date":"25 November 2001","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Romance","Review":"  Alot of times you will see movie comments/reviews on films on here, and they will be short and to the point.

In my opinion, there is no such things as too racy when you are trying to make people laugh. That is what the R-rated version does. It has tons of added racy footage that makes the film funnier because it makes me laugh more. I'm not saying that just being crude is funny, I'm saying that when the crude content is used right, it can be funny and it is funny here. I now own both the R-rated version and the PG-13 version and both of them make me laugh, yet it's the R-rated one that makes me laugh harder. Steve Zahn and Jack Black get more screen time in the R-rated version. It's a good thing too because I thought that the PG-13 version gave Amanda Peet and Jason Biggs way too much screen time.

But what do we expect? There are some gross out scenes, a lot of them actually. But if you can forgive those, there are some really funny, weird scenes. Adding in a cameo (ultra spoiler here) by Neil himself at the end, wonderful. Also and appearance by Varney, a Vietnam era drill instructor in such movies as Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket, as a very strange football coach, there are some plot diversions that one can at least go huh at.It's still juvenile, and very stupid usually, but there's enough fun, amidst the gross out, that at the right moment, it might be worth it.

Then of course, Judith Fessbeggler (Peet) comes into the picture as a romantic interest for Darren, set up together as a joke by Wayne. Soon enough Judith takes control of Darren's life and everything he does and the two remaining friends set out on a mission to replace Judith with Darren's long lost love Sandy Perkus (Detmer). That's when the comedy begins.If Steve Zahn and Jack Black weren't in this movie, no one would've even bothered making it. They are the source of all laughs in this movie. Jason Biggs could easily be forgotten if it weren't for everything in the movie revolving around his relationships. Amanda Peet is beautiful and at the same time she doesn't revolve around her image enough to prevent her from going crazy for a few laughs. Amanda Detmer is just as forgettable as Biggs. They tried to make her funny with references to a circus mishap, becoming a nun, and dressing her up like a prostitute and yet it's still impossible to think of her as funny. Another memorable character besides Zahn's and Black's is that of Coach Norton (R. Lee Ermey). With every line, he delivers hysteria. Though he's a minor character, he stays in your mind long after Biggs' Silverman does, as wrong as that sounds.This movie would've been perfect if only Biggs and Detmer could've broken out of their shell enough to stir about a laugh. Of course the most important fault in this entire movie is the never ending obsession with Neil Diamond! Wow guys, we could've picked up on the fact that Neil Diamond is great with a subtle reference or two, but having the entire movie revolve around him, basically, destroyed the entire movie!

More than a decade later, he still hasn't lost his knack for making comedies that make viewers lose the will to live. How bad is it, you ask?It's so bad that it can't even get the fundamentals of its plot right; we're supposed to think that Jason Biggs's fiancee is the reincarnation of one of the Borgias, but a) his friends and fellow Neil Diamond freaks (Jack Black and Steve Zahn) are teeth-grindingly unbearable, and b) in spite of Amanda Peet's best efforts she still comes off as appealing in comparison (apparently making him take her surname when they're married, burning Neil Diamond LPs and refusing to fellate him after he's gone down on her are grounds for being the devil in human form). The movie's tasteless, which I can live with; it's also almost totally unfunny, uninspired (swearing nuns? Wow, that's new) and extremely mean-spirited (isn't throwing a flagpole through an umpire and killing him FUNNY?), which I can't.Even at around 90 minutes it seems to go on forever, and when the real Diamond turns up it's one of several points that would have made me run screaming from the cinema had I gone to see it there. The cast tries hard, so it's not their fault - but quite a few people involved need to have a word with their agent. Saving Silverman is yet another in that burgeoning sub-genre of Pretty Lame Movies That Would Have Been Even Worse Without Amanda Peet (although it must be said that she gets out-babed here by Amanda Detmer - though in fairness, she's supposed to be playing a more appealing character so that's okay).P.S. I really want to believe that that is indeed Amanda Detmer's naked bottom and not a body double's. I really do...

You have to really want the movie to work to see anything funny in it.  And, believe me, I really, really wanted this movie to work.  There is usually nothing funnier than slobby-guy humor.  Sadly, the amount of goodwill generated by parents watching their children in a school pageant would not have been enough to make this movie funny.

Parts of the movie could have been a good Saturday Night Live sketch (for those who remember when that show was funny), but that is about it.BTW - There is a review for SAVING SILVERMAN on IMDB that refers to it as a pre-DEER HUNTER Viet Nam movie.  The movie to which that reviewer is actually referring is THE BOYS FROM COMPANY C.  It was the first movie for R. Lee Emery, more famous as the drill instructor from FULL METAL JACKET.

He must have bad advisors. Saving Silverman contained many possibilities but nothing remotely funny came out of this poor excuse for a comedy.

You have to have all the leftover humor but not forgetting a good screenplay.  Saving Silverman, starring Jason Biggs and Amanda Peet, was a physical comedy about first impression, and the people who aren't good at them.Wayne (Steve Zahn) tells the story about Darren Silverman (Biggs), a guy who has always been very gullable with the ladies.  When Judith (Amanda Peet) comes along, Darren falls for her and ends up moving in with her.  Now, Wayne and J.D. (Jack Black) have always been Darren's best friends, and they have always tried to follow Neil Diamond's footsteps.  When it comes the time for Judith to meet the boys, the day is ruined because they spill almost every liquid on her.  After a while, Judith asks Darren to marry her, so the marriage is on.  But Wayne and J.D. kidnap Judith and fake her death.  So what will happen?  Watch it to find out.The whole idea, like every great comedy, is awesome.  The film itself is awesome.  Not only is Judith's response to the kidnap funny, but so is Darren's.  Jason Biggs is not as funny as his other movies, but that's probably because his character is not meant to be such a goof-off.  Jack Black and Steve Zahn, on the other hand, lead the movie with much elegance, delivering laugh after laugh from the deeps of your belly.  Amanda Peet, rumored to be a fearless actress (even though I think Sandra Bullock could have done a better job), is more than perfect as a strict and nasty Judith.Physical humor plays a major part here.  That's probably the kind of humor that makes the most of the people laugh, unlike crude and sexual humor like in Scary Movie.  Yes, before you ask, there are some crude and sexual jokes, but physical humor is the major kind of humor.  These very funny physical gags are made more by the two leading men Zahn and Black.  They are perfect as the two leading men also.  Need people tripping, being attacked by nasty racoons or shooting themselves in the leg by tranquilizer guns, see Saving Silverman.This comedy, like Sugar & Spice, was very underrated by major critics.  This is also a diamond, like other achievement comedies  Meet the Parents, Miss Congeniality, Sugar & Spice, Dumb and Dumber...I can't think of any more, but the point is that Saving Silverman belongs in this list of diamond comedies.  Like I said before, comedies are hard to make.Some people laugh at drug jokes, even though they are clearly unfunny (but delivered greatly in my all-time favorite movie Go), and others laugh at sexual jokes.  Err....scratch that.  No one laughs at sexual jokes, every since seeing Scary Movie.  But I prefer laughing at physical jokes like in Saving Silverman, the first real great comedy of the year 2001.Without further adieu, I say that Saving Silverman was a major cool, awesome physical-flick, deserving every inch of critic respect it probably got (or didn't).

It heads down the by now well-trod path of dumb gross out humor (e.g. any Adam Sandler movie ... or the far superior There's Something About Mary and the like). There are a few moments that verge on comic inspiration (the characters' Neil Diamond obsession, power-lifting nuns), and a few novel bathroom-humor ideas that, unfortunately, don't really make any sense, either in the context of the movie, or real life, or any other context I can think of.We may have gone about as far as we want to with movies about irresponsible dim-bulb social and intellectual retards (who, in this case, actually manage to be underachievers, which is an accomplishment considering their limitations). I guess the character type has been around for awhile, but I'd place the origin of its recent rise somewhere around the Bachelor Party movie. There, though, we understood that the characters were actually somewhat functional in their normal lives, outside the temporary context of the story line. Lately, we've got Adam Sandler and now these doofuses.Basically, they're 25 (or so) year olds, with the emotional and intellectual capabilities of an 11-year-old. A charming notion, when Tom Hanks did it (expressly) in Big, but really pretty stupid here.The cast did what they could. Jack Black and Steve Zahn are capable comic actors; both are intermittently amusing, but neither can do a lot with the material. On the other hand, this was actually a pretty good role for Amanda Peet. In previous appearances, I've found her attractive, but not much of an actress.

Audiences seem to revel in that funny funny funny scene of masturbating with an apple pie. How inventive? How clever? How cutting edge? NO!  Lame with capital LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL! Off the box office success of American Pie, we get this monstrosity.  Think of the script!!  Somebody went to akeyboard and actually WROTE this stuff.  It's mind boggling.

Every single joke and gag falls flat and seems lame, not to mention how unbelievably predictable the film and jokes/gags are. There wasn't one moment in the film where I was surprised. The plot is ridiculous; I suppose it could be argued that it's supposed to be, but come on... there aren't a lot of films that make less sense(though they do exist, believe it or not). The acting is horrible. Jason Biggs gave an incredibly tame performance, and both Zahn and Black overact their parts terribly. The rest of the cast is embarrassing too. The characters are terribly written clichés, and several of them are inconsistent. For a few scenes, Judith is just a well-educated, intelligent woman who wants more out of life than sports and beer. For most of the film, though, she's a prissy bitch who doesn't seem to care about anyone other than herself. I hated the way several scenes portrayed her behavior as an intelligent and smart woman who had principles and morals, and then made that out to be just as bad as her being the bitch she is for rest of the film. That merely shows just how ignorant and misogynistic the director is, which leads me to believe that he has quite an astounding hatred towards females. The main character, Biggs, is supposed to be a hopeless romantic, but he comes off as a naive moron instead. Also, the friends, who we are supposed to be rooting for, are stupid, ignorant, typical teen-guy stereotypes, who the audience winds up hating almost as much as the one-dimensional character of Judith. The humor consists of gross-out comedy, consists often of humiliation and pain, and is almost always centered on sex in one way or another. The romance part of the movie seems like it was merely tacked on to build a plot around. The chemistry between the actors is almost completely non-existent. Also, the humor is very crude and graphic; I can't believe they managed to trick the MPAA into giving the film a PG-13. It's almost as graphic as several R-rated titles. The only reason(and believe me, I do mean *only*) for me rating this higher than the lowest scoring of a 1 is the fact that it does maintain some form of consistency, and possibly makes sense on some childish level(which is more than what could be said than, say, Blair Witch Project, and Scary Movie 2, just to name two). Also, I did enjoy the few scenes of Amanda Peet being virtually naked. I don't recommend anyone to watch it just for that, though, unless you can watch it entirely free of charge, and you aren't forced to sit through the entirety of this mess of childish humor and a barely plausible plot. I recommend this solely to children and people with childish humor(fans of Adam Sandler, for example) as anyone who doesn't like that humor, or anyone who enjoys some form of thought put into the film they're watching, will hate this film as much as I did, and possibly more.

A screwball comedy like this one has to walk a fine line between being too outrageous and raunchy, or not funny at all. Some (like the critic Ebert) will fail to enjoy its comedy and others (like the critic Berardinelli) will find it totally entertaining. I belong to the latter group. There are so many funny episodes that it would be unfair to mention one. And, while all the actors did justice to their characters, Amanda Detmer was the most perfect, as the former cheerleader and now novice in a convent, just days away from taking her vows, but finds herself still attracted to her old high school friend who had never gotten around to asking her out. Neil Diamond appears as himself, and the musical number at the end featuring Mr Diamond and the main cast members as his back-up vocals is a nice punctuation to a funny movie.SPOILERS follow, for my own benefit, please read no further.Biggs' is shy, meets Peet, a psychologist tired of 'masculine, aggressive men', they date, she asks him to marry her, his long-time friends Black and Zahn think she is wrong for him, will upset their buddyhood, kidnaps Peet, digs up a body, fakes her death by car going off a cliff and burning, really kidnap her, keep her chained in their house, old coach gets out of prison after impaling a referee with a yardage marker after a questionable call, visits them, 'you didn't kill her?', meanwhile Detmer meets up with Biggs who thinks Peet is dead, they start to bond, Peet breaks out and shows up, one guy with two gorgeous girls, Detmer leaves, at wedding for Biggs/Peet, guys go get Detmer right before final vows, bring her to wedding, Diamond starts to sing 'I Do' right when minister asks 'does anyone object', Detmer shows up, she and Biggs profess love, Zahn and Peet get into a fight, with fists, then nose to nose kiss, the end is a triple wedding, Peet/Zahn,  Biggs/Detmer, and Black with his old coach after both of them realized they were 'gay.'

The film is Saving Silverman, directed by Dennis Dugan, who has experience with low-brow, tasteless humor (Big Daddy, Happy Gilmore) but never has he laid his paws on a project this unimaginably horrible. It is so bad in so many different ways we question what attracted the stars to this material. Amanda Peet was so good in The Whole Nine Yards, but destroys her credibility here; Steve Zahn can really make us laugh if provided with the right comic elements, just take a look at Happy Texas;  and Jason Biggs, well, he has never been in a movie of true quality, but even American Pie, Boys and Girls, and Loser were better than this insipid, unfunny, and stupid so called comedy.The plot Darren (Jason Biggs), Wayne (Steve Zahn), and J.D. (Jack Black) have been best friends since their school years; they even have a band named after their music idol, Neil Diamond. Darren is a social worker. Wayne is a pest controller. J.D. is a fired Subway employee. The three guys have nothing better to do than scramble from bar to bar hoping to pick up a young woman for Darren because he has never recovered from the girl of his dreams, Sandy (Amanda Detmer), from high school. One night they get Darren fixed with the wrong girl.Her name is Judith Snodgrass-Fessbeggler (Amanda Peet), and she is a sophisticated psychologist. They have nothing in common, have no chemistry together, and seeming distrust each other, but they both fall in love immediately. She proposes to him after a few weeks. He accepts. Judith seemingly has compete control over Darren's entire livelihood. She demands that he never spend time with his disgusting friends again, and that he must quit their band. Wayne and J.D. attempt to end Judith and Darren's relationship by kidnapping the unsuspecting witch and setting their best friend up with his old love interest.The characters wander around the screenplay with little or nothing to do. The story is a sketch to rationalize a series of painfully cheap jokes, and hey, I have some space to kill, some of the film's best humor includes a group of nuns body building, jokes about homosexuality, an electric prod zapping certain parts of someone's body, R. Lee Ermy taking a dump in a person's front yard, a violent struggle between Judith and her two kidnappers, and the sight of a butt cheek implant that is not for the faint of heart. There is also a scene where Amanda Peet's character threatens to take away Darren's masturbation privileges. This is a problem for Darren, as demonstrated by an earlier scene where Judith is pleasured by Darren but when it comes his turn, she hands him a porno magazine and a bottle of hand lotion.Saving Silverman is obviously from the imagination of horny, amateur and breast-obsessed people; Judith's wardrobe is more revealing than Jennifer Lopez's Grammy outfit, the entire plot is based on sexual urges and contains a wide selection of wanking off jokes. The film clearly strives to contain humor that is sure to offend everyone, putting the PG-13 rating in question here. Nothing in this movie adds up to much of anything. There is a scene where an old wrinkly man wins a game of bingo, jumping out of his seat to reveal his bare buttock that fills the movie screen; this exemplifies the experience of watching Saving Silverman.

Saving Silverman is the worst movie I've seen over a decade. It is just flat awful, and even more repugnant by the vast wealth of talent that is taken down on this Titanic of a film. This film makes Dennis Dugan's last film, Big Daddy, seem like Citizen Kane. It is not just a failure as a film-it is a failure in what it says about society, and what Hollywood thinks we want to see on a Friday night.  I have never left a movie feeling so sad as I did after this film.To believe in the world of Saving Silverman is to believe the worst in humanity friends who will commit felonies to keep their friend from marrying, nuns who swear and fornicate, a woman who believes love is control, a man who is believes making love in a monogamous relationship is some Jergens and a porn magazine, a group of football fans that barely bat an eyelash at a murder.  Yes, all this happens in `Saving Silverman' and is played for laughs. It is almost unbearable.The worst crime is the waste of talent.  Jack Black, who gave an Oscar worthy performance earlier this year in High Fidelity, and was electric in the HBO series Tenacious D, is relegated into an carnivorous ogre.  R. Lee Ermey, a man who served his country valiantly as a U.S marine, and served the movie audience with groundbreaking performances in films like `Full Metal Jacket,' is relegated to a murdering football coach who, in his most undistinguished moment, is shown relieving himself on the front lawn, and using the mail as toilet paper.  Jason Biggs, who basically carried his first film, American Pie, is totally undistinguished as a spineless milquetoast who even the most bashful of men want to shake him silly. And Amanda Peet, the comedic heart and soul of The Whole Nine Yards isn't allowed to be funny--her character is so evil, that nobody can love her. Even Neil Diamond, yes THE Neil Diamond, gives a jittery performance that makes him look like he's past his prime. I am biased.  I am from the Seattle/Tacoma area (where this film is based and filmed in).  We are not spineless, shallow, obsessed, stupid.

We were all big fans of Jack Black ( an amazing talent ). I have always thought highly of Steve Zahn and Amanda Peet as well. Jason Biggs is talented, yet I am not that big of a fan. How could Silverman miss we thought? Good Lord does this film suck!!! How could the director miss with such a cast!?! I mean my Grandma could have made a more interesting comedy and she has not seen a picture-show since Oklahoma. The character's motivations made no sense. One minute this guy is in a Neil Diamond tribute band, the next he is hopelessly devoted to a fairly hot chick that he met in a bar. Why? We have virtually no backgound on these people, we recieved no reasoning whatsoever for his lack of balls. He is not even getting to bang her!!!! Peet is pretty to be sure, but she is not all that. I mean c'mon guys would you give up your freedom and friends for a cruel bitch that you can't touch (sorry married guys-you already made this choice)? And why is SHE so big on this idea? She has nothing better to do than screw with this geek's head? A lot of suppossed high-jinks ensue, but if you have half of a brain you probably won't care. The jokes are ill-timed and written and executed at about the level of a 10 year-old. As I sat there dumbfounded by this waste of film eyeballing the handfull of (semi-retarded I'm guessing) teen-agers hoot and snort at some of the pitiful gags , my mind wandered back a couple of years to another gross-out comedy that I saw in the very same theater- There's Something About Mary. Mary was a vastly superior film in every respect. The characters were real, consistent and well-developed. There were genuine surprises and WELL-TIMED bathroom jokes. There was a genuine sense of style and craftsmanship to Mary as well. There was absolutely NO sense of style, surprise or craftmanship to Silverman it was obviously thrown together-badly. Please don't get me wrong, I am not a snob (or a taleted speller) I usually like the off-color comedies-Mr. Show, Caddyshack, Meatballs, Blazing Saddles, I'm Dancing As Fast As I Can, Swingers, Anything Monty Python, Repo Man... you know what I'm talking about. Go ahead be dumb, gross or outrageous, but please be competent and consitent with your storytelling. Is it asking too much to not waste the talents of Black, Biggs, Zahn, Ermy, Peet, et al.? I dunno, I feel like a sap for writing this much about it . Saving Siverman was a big diappointment-It Sucked!! If you rent it you will be disappointed.

I mean, I didn't walk in the theater expecting to see The Godfather and I would have been pleasantly surprised had it been similar to the raunchy college-age relationship comedy Mallrats, but Saving Silverman didn't come close.  What we as an audience got out of this movie was an amoral, poorly scripted, terribly acted film that WAS NOT FUNNY.  That's right - it simply did not inspire me to open my mouth and let out an unforced, relaxed chortle or even a giggle or snicker.  The reason that similarly aimed slapstick/raunch-fest films like Happy Gilmore and Airplane! got away with poor direction and bad acting was because they were actually FUNNY - these films, though not splendid productions, worked with the audience and had truly hysterical moments.  Yet for every funny title that connected with an audience, there is a Little Nicky or a Jane Austen's Mafia! or a Joe Dirt that simply do not make anyone over the age of six laugh.  I would (without any hesitation) place Saving Silverman into this category.  Director Dennis Dugan does an awful job slopping together an overlong, amateur script from writers who simply shouldn't be in this line of work.  Stars Jason Biggs (with yet another uninspired turn in his career, a la American Pie 2 and Loser) and Steve Zahn are appealing, but Amanda Peet - while nice to look at - simply cannot act for a mound of horse poop.  Jack Black, trying his hardest to at least look like he's having fun, is really annoying here and the audience quickly tires of his dim-witted remarks.  I'd suggest he should stick to smaller, more COMICAL roles like the clerk in High Fidelity.But all these complaints do not matter to many moviegoers - all they want to know is whether or not Saving Silverman is funny.  So I will boldly deliver their answer NO!!!! The actors are unfunny in their joke delivery, the punch lines are nonexistent, the situations are ridiculously mediocre, and the fun is nowhere to be seen.  Keep away, Sandler Fans (or people who otherwise like to LAUGH).But this would only be an editorial if I didn't give some plus points...after all, it isn't Battlefield Earth (which was much funnier than this, I must say).  Let's see...well, there are some very nice set pieces and Neil Diamond is tolerable, at best.  There, I found a plus point in a vomit-inducing bomb like this one.

But Van Wilder is better than Saving Silverman for one fundamental reason. With Van Wilder I was mostly bored out of my mind. Saving Silverman, by contrast, spat in my face with its abundance of senseless profanity, sickening concepts of humor, and offensive misogyny even though it's supposed to be about friendship and true love. I saw this picture many, many years ago and I can still recollect to this day sitting there with a gaping mouth, my eyes glued to the screen only to see just how much more offensive and morally mordacious it could get.The movie's stars are Steve Zahn and Jack Black, two people who I think show talent but are wasted here, as two of a longtime threesome friendship. The third man of their group is Jason Biggs, playing a lovesick dweeb of a loser (that means he's pathetic) who thinks he's found the love of his life in a tenaciously autocratic woman played by Amanda Peet. When Biggs's high school crush (Amanda Detner) steps into the picture, Zahn and Black decide to try and break Peet from Biggs by any means necessary and reunite him with his former love.In theory, this could have been more than efficient. Yes, I like the idea of Saving Silverman. Two friends are shut off from their buddy by a tyrannizing lover and try to save him. Yes, I even like the *idea* of them kidnapping her as effort to save him. Yes, I liked the concept. What I didn't like - what I hated - was the tasteless, astoundingly bad methods that the screenwriters and director Dennis Dugan decided to go with. The most harmless 'humor' in this picture is people getting beat up, slapped around, and getting attacked by raccoons. Typically boring routine slapstick. That's dull, but harmless. Insulting are the lack of taste in the satire of nuns (and overused excuse for humor), the tiresome profanity, and the always tiresome gags about closet homosexuals. The fact that they are still using that, nine years later in The Other Guys gives me little hope for modern-day slapsticks. I'll take Joe E. Brown or Jerry Lewis over this any day. These jokes here are not only not funny, but a little sickening, as is that visually disgusting moment where Jason Biggs has plastic surgery on his hindquarters. Yuck!What I also found morally repugnant was the movie's look toward women. I already mentioned the unfavorable approach on profanity-spitting, macho nuns. Let's talk about how the two Amandas are presented. The two central female characters in the picture. One is a despicable tyrant and the other is portrayed as a slattern. A goodhearted slattern, but a slattern nonetheless. Amanda Peet having nothing to do but be vicious and chew up her scenes and Amanda Detner being clothed in the thinnest of clothing and yet at the same time, be trying to achieve chastity by becoming a sister. Why is it, I ask that women are treated a lot in modern-day comedies as (insert word for female dogs) or sluts? Can't they be respectable? They're actually treated with less dignity than the male stars. And I couldn't stand their characters, either.Now Saving Silverman did hold my attention, because I had a strong reaction to what I saw. But reactions go both ways. Positive and negative. I had an intensely strong negative reaction to his picture and I was thunderstruck at just how offensively dumb it could get. It's a good idea with a good cast that should have been utilized with a good script. The only element I found interesting was R. Lee Emery's performance as the former coach of the three dummies. It's better for a movie to be forgettably bad than memorably bad. This is the latter. It's been years and I can still taste the bitter detestation.

While my take on the film will not be favored by females or those who sympathize with them, I think it goes without saying that Steve Zahn and Jack Black (two of Biggs' buddies since childhood) stand in for any number of disenchanted males who watch their long-time friends get hitched. These guys are the perennial dimwit losers who live in squalor, idolize Neil Diamond (who makes a cameo), and perform in a cover band. They 'accidentally' hook their buddy up with reptilian ice-queen Amanda Peet (both artificially cruel and convincingly manipulative), who turns out to be no good, and spend the rest of the film trying to save their hapless pal (who is such a pathetic weakling you wonder why they even bother); that Biggs' former flame--a girl who is one week away from becoming a nun (cue contrived plot device)--resurfaces adds another layer of turmoil to the dim narrative. If viewed as a comedy, Saving Silverman has maybe 4 or 5 big laughs scattered throughout its 90-minute run time, but most of its humor is obvious and falls flat; however, as a cautionary tale about the perils of female influence on weak-willed males, it's an indispensable piece of cinema--crude and contrived, granted, but will give you second thoughts before referring your best friend to an unattached female.

It will put you right to sleep. I can say this, of course, only in review of the parts that I saw up until I couldn't take it anymore and had to turn it off. I should have listened when the video store rental guy whose opinion I usually solicit. He took one look at the title I was renting and said, Hey, you're on your own with that one. Don't say I didn't warn you.

It's a shame it didn't do well at the bos office because it's actually a very good and funny film. The film basically centers around three buddies when becomes whipeed by his girl they try to save him. The film has everything you could want tits,humor, heart and  did I mention tits ? Jason Biggs is great in the lead role and Steve Zahn and Jack Black provide great comic relief. Check it out.

This is very low-brow stuff.  Don't expect to see anything of high intelligence.  Please leave your inhibitions at the door.  Sure, this is not a great comedy that will go down in history, but it's a damn funny one.  After seeing tons of comedies that did not make me laugh, this movie was a sheer relief.  I was laughing out loud, and so were the people in the theater!The plot is all pretty predictable--and highly implausible.  It's another film with sitcom plotting that consists merely of setups for another punchline.  In this case, the punchlines were plenty.  At times, I felt they overdid the comedy, piling as many gags as possible into one scene, but that didn't cause a major problem.  The cast is fine.  Jason Biggs, of course, is a stiff since that's what his character requires him to be.  He's the straight man, while Steve Zahn and Jack Black steal the show, providing many of the film's laughs.  Zahn and Black are perfect for comedies like this.  They have that stupid quality that actually comes off as funny, and not obnoxious.  I also MUST mention R. Lee Ermey (of Full Metal Jacket fame) as the psychotic football coach.  He is absolutely brilliant, and a treat to watch every moment he's on screen.  He pretty much acts out a caricature of his role in the Stanley Kubrick classic.  And he has the film's most hilarious moment, which I will not give away.The gags are often crude, but they never take the crudeness to the extreme.  After seeing all the previous gross-out comedies, you should be immune to the crudeness in this one.  I can't say it's all done in good taste, because I'd be lying, but trust me...you'll laugh.My score  7 (out of 10) "},{"Title":"A true rarity...","Date":"13 February 2001","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Romance","Review":"  This movie holds the great dishonour of being the first movie terrible enough to drive me out of the cinema.Sure, I've given up on videos, changed the channel on TV movie airings, and yanked the earphones on airplane movies, but until now I'd never walked out on a movie.As horribly unfunny (read 'moronic') as this movie was, the true terror was that the rest of the audience were actually laughing.  And just as I was beginning to trust humanity once more...I'm probably too late to save anyone, but if not, DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE!!!

Reasonable plot about two band members trying to save the third from his new Psychiatrist girl friend who is thoroughly dominating him.Zahn, Black and Bugs just aren't up to adult or even teenage comedy so we are stuck with something for the pre-schoolers.Too bad because Peet and Perkus are beautiful but wasted in this horror.

I think Jack Black's skills are totally wasted in this film.. You really have to work hard to ruin a comedy,, and this movie pulled it off..
