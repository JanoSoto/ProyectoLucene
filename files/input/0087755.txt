I loved this movie then; I love it still.Actually, it's my favorite among the first three, classic Muppet films; Muppet Movie is great but overlong, while Great Muppet Caper is terrific, but seems a bit dated now. Muppets Take Manhattan, on the other hand, never fails to entertain me, still makes me laugh out loud (the purse-snatching scene; Kermit in his Bert Convy 'fro), and even tugs at my heartstrings.What's particularly nice about this adventure is that it's an affectionate love letter to Hollywood musicals of yore, without being overly parodying. The musical comedy cliches are presented in a matter-of-fact manner; just as we were expected to suspend our disbelief when Ruby Keeler went out onstage a nobody but came back a star!, we suspend our disbelief to encompass a group of talking animals putting together a big budget Broadway musical in 2 weeks. These kind of hoary plot devices are presented straight-faced, without any self-conscious winking or irony.The songs are all pretty darn terrific; the show-stopping Together Again finale is as good as any contemporary musical number of the last 20 years or so, while It's Time for Saying Goodbye always puts a lump in my throat it's sentimental without being maudlin. The finale, He/She Makes Me Happy goes from being sweet to comically over-the-top in less than 3 minutes, and it's a joy.The expected parade of cameos work well within the structure, without being intrusive. My particular favorites are Liza Minnelli's (the whole Sardi's scene is wonderful), Linda Lavin's (another terrific comedy moment YOU are Mr. Enrico Tortellini of Passaic, New Jersey!), and Joan Rivers' (another gem). The Muppet performers are their usual, endearing selves lovable, warm, likable. The love triangle between Kermit, Piggy and the human Jenny plays surprisingly well, and Piggy's jealous reactions are hysterical.These days, family entertainment usually means disgustingly white-washed pap that anyone over 10 or 11 would find either sedating or inane. (Disney's live action 101 Dalmations and its sequel spring to mind.) The Muppet movies proved that a G-rated film could be intelligent, witty, funny and entertaining for all ages. It's a formula that has yet to be improved upon, and The Muppets Take Manhattan just might be the best example of it.

There just isn't enough Muppets.  Most of the gang leaves during the very beginning and it's all about Kermit, Piggy and Rizzo.  Great characters, yes, but without the whole wacky ensemble it's just not the same.  That, and the film is kind of just reinforcing what happened in the original Muppet movie, only replacing Hollywood with Broadway.Don't get me wrong, it's an enjoyable movie, but it's not grade 'A' muppet material.

Well, it is mainly pointed towards them, but it's also well-rounded enough with the jokes pointed also at the adults in the audience. This time around, the Muppet gang try to get on Broadway, with the dire straits keeping them from getting it produced, leading them to splitting up. But Kermit won't stop, and his determination keeps things moving along until after getting the deal together he gets hit by a car and sent into amnesia! It's a send-up, in part, of those old starring vehicles from the 40s with musicals actually as the topic of a musical, only here there's the usual lot of zaniness and wonderful moments thrown into a pot of hysterically funny moments (Lou Zealand's boomerang fish; Gonzo's water-stunt display, the whisper campaign, among many others), but also with a lot of heart too. The Muppet writers aren't shy of the conventions, on the contrary, they embrace them to the point where it's almost refreshing to see such a 'lets put on a show' story where through thick and think the characters will meet their dream. While not as totally original in scope as the Muppet Movie, it's got many catchy and memorable songs, excellent locations all over Manhattan, and even some intonations of inter-species dating (and marriage)! Cameos include Liza Minneli (a frog?), Elliot Gould (as the cop), Brooke Shields (propositioned by a rat), Edward I. Koch, Gregory Hines and Joan Rivers. So get ready to sing-along, or just have a lot of big laughs and romantic (yes romantic) times with one of the best Muppet movies.

I honestly don't remember if I liked it at the time or not. However, somewhere in college I watched this film again, and it wound up going (and staying) into my personal Best Films Ever collection.This film is LOADED with humor that goes far above and beyond what one would have expected from the Muppets. I mean, obviously the Muppets always have appealed to adults and children because there's humor geared towards both generations. But come on...Janice is accidentally overheard telling someone I don't take my clothes off for anyone, even if it IS artistic...there's a joke from a father to a son that if the son in love with Kermit the Frog then the father doesn't want to hear it...Gonzo saves a chicken with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation (sp?) and afterwards says I think we're engaged now...these and plenty of other moments in the film had me rolling. Add to that very smart dialogue, very smart New York/Broadway wink wink humor, the usual large amount of celebrity cameos and some really enjoyable songs that don't border on kid-level cheesy whatsoever...this film is a masterpiece! I don't throw 10's out on a regular basis...but this one deserves it. Over 20 years later, this film totally holds up, perhaps even more so. The Muppets never were and never will be again, as funny and smart and just plain brilliant as this film was and is. ---Q "},{"Title":"The Best of the Muppet Films.","Date":"22 September 2003","Score":"7 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":"  Very fun and impressive third Muppet movie has our heroes leaving college to make it big on Broadway in New York.

It really isn't their best or most memorable one though.Lets face it and be honest here, this movie really isn't the greatest made or best written one. The only real reason that the movie still works out is thanks to the Muppets. The humor actually isn't that much good, since its mostly simply written and the events are predictable. Nevertheless the movie still manages to become funny because of the humorous and well known characters, that need no introduction.For me it really was in this case Miss Piggy that makes the movie work out. Her character features by far the most humorous and enjoyable situations. Miss Piggy is basically a Muppet-favorite of every one! She is such a great and comical character. Also the idea alone that a grown up man, such as Frank Oz, is with his hand inside a silly looking pig and doing a very feminine voice is reason enough already to crack me up. I really respect the Muppet-performers and their timing and handling is always just great, especially Frank Oz who always is subtle and handles the most enjoyable Muppet characters. Besides acting, Frank Oz also was the person who directed and wrote the movie.The movie concentrates a bit too much on just the two main characters of the movie; Kermit and Miss Piggy. Also the human cast gets wasted because of that but of course also most of the Muppet characters. They put (too) many Muppets in the movie but doesn't provide them with enough room to let them shine, or their characters speak out. They tried to do so by putting in some extra solo sequences, featuring some of the Muppet characters, which felt like a last minute addition but was amusing, though distracting, nevertheless. The movie also features Rizzo the Rat in his first big movie role but it's too bad that he didn't teamed up with Gonzo yet in this on. The movie could had really used another and distracting from the main plot, comical duo, besides Kermit and Miss Piggy.The movie yet again features many cameo from well known actors and other celebrities. Celebrities and Muppets always have been a great combination. Not only well known (at the time) celebrities make a cameo but also the Sesame Street characters do so, toward the ending.It's obvious that they used this movie as a vehicle to also use some new puppet techniques, that in my opinion however don't work out and are redundant. Showing the Muppet's legs when they walk, bad idea! Putting someone in a Miss Piggy suit when she is on roller-blades, bad idea!Though the movie is mostly forgettable it of course still features some great sequences such as the one with the Muppet babies. It also of course features some good comedy moments and it obviously makes this an enjoyable simple movie to watch but it's all not quite enough for this movie to really make a lasting impression. Out of all the Muppet movies this is probably the one with the most less re-playability factor.6/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Still fun, but lacks the spark that made the first two films so memorable.","Date":"20 April 2012","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":" After getting the formula about right with The Great Muppet Caper, the series takes a strange turn with 'Manhattan' only a few years later. Veteran Muppet Frank Oz takes the helm from Jim Henson and makes a few minor but noticeable changes. Gone are the nods and winks to the audience for the most part, and the film is far more plot based and linear than the slapstick shenanigans of the first film.Kermit and the gang are finishing college and pondering their futures, which will very likely result in them all moving on separately and losing touch. However Kermit boldly concocts a plan that will see the gang remain together, by heading en masse to Manhattan to launch a massive stage musical called Manhattan Melodies, with all the Muppets as performers or stage hands.Unfortunately after just a few short days, no success and low on funds, the various characters are forced to disperse and forge their own future, with the promise from Kermit to summon them all if/when the musical gets greenlit. Kermit takes a job in a diner and everyone goes their separate ways.In many ways this is a more depressing film than the first two &#x96; even with the frog killing theme &#x96; for long periods of time the characters mope and ponder a future alone, and it seems that the Muppets will never again operate in unison. Of course this isn't how the film ends, but even in a puppet movie you don't need to be kept sad for over half the running time.The jokes are less frequent and the tone less tongue in cheek. The cameos are still plentiful but are more 'look here's the famous cameo' than in other films. The inclusion of the Muppet Babies in a thinly veiled promo for the spin-off is as entertaining as it is blatant, and in some ways is a minor indictment on the dull tone of the rest of the film that it can be upstaged by a flashback.There is another attempt at a grand sequence with Piggy taking a skate through the park, but it is far less successful than either of the sequences from Caper, and the big finale was an apt but desperate ending to proceedings.Final Rating &#x96; 6.5 / 10. I by no means am saying steer clear of Manhattan, but after the Muppet Movie got the ball rolling and Caper took such a great leap forward, it is disappointing that the franchise would take a step back like this.

See, in the first two, it was a movie within a movie. In Muppet Movie, they watched a movie they made of themselves. In Great Muppet Caper, they walked us through the movie, but Muppets Take Manhattan isn't actually a movie, it's the Muppets in real life. I hope everyone understands that concept.        Kermit the Frog, Fozzie, Gonzo, Miss Piggy, Scooter, Animal, Rowlf, Dr. Teeth, Floyd Pepper, Janice, Zoot and Camilla are all in college. They put on a show for their fraternity and would like it if their show were good enough for Broadway. So after graduation, they leave New Jersey and go to New York City! As soon as they get there, they're down on their luck. They're broke. Penniless. The only lodgings in their price range were bus station lockers.        They stop at a restaurant where rats are waiters. The owner, Pete, gives Kermit hope. Kermit's friends feel they depend on him too much and decide to go off on their own. So begins a very heartbreaking music montage where each one goes their own separate way. But Kermit isn't giving up. He's going to get Manhattan Melodies on Broadway if it's the last thing he does. He becomes friends with Jenny, who helps him try to pass his idea to talent agents. But during all that time, Miss Piggy was watching Kermit and got very upset whenever he and Jenny hugged. They're reunited in the park and during a coach ride, they reminisce about when they were babies. This scene spun off into the Muppet Babies! A very cute scene! Clever idea and so was the TV show.        Kermit had received letters from his pals. Scooter became a theater manager, Rowlf became a pet store clerk, Gonzo was a daredevil, Fozzie was hibernating in Maine, and so on. Kertmit receives a letter from an agent who was very interested in the play! Bernard Crawford and his son Ronnie. Great! They were going to Broadway! No more bad luck. Except for Kermit, who was hit by a car and developed amnesia. He became a corporate advertising agent with three other frogs, Gill, Bill and Jill. The friends had to snap Kermit out of it and get ready for opening night! And when Manhattan Melodies opened that night, there was a huge turn out! Even the Sesame Street gang was there! The end resulted in Kermit and Miss Piggy getting married--by a real minister!     Despite this being a different kind of Muppet movie, it's still a good one. And like the first two, this one has celebrity cameos. There's Dabney Coleman, Brooke Sheilds, Joan Rivers, Art Carney, and Gregory Hines. So if you like the Muppets and you'd like to see the Muppet Babies in Muppet form, you gotta see this film.- "}{"Title":"The Best!","Date":"13 February 2004","Score":"4 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":"  The Muppets Take ManhattanThe best of the Muppet films sees the iconic furry creatures venturing to Manhattan in hopes of lighting up Broadway with their songs and dancing.

There's also a galaxy of relatively well known actors who play cameos in this, including folks like Dabney Coleman, Joan Rivers, Gregory Hines and Brooke Shields, to name but a few.By the time this ends, the movie's getting close to two hours long, which is probably a bit too long for a Muppet movie, and there's no real surprise or drama involved in it - the most dramatic element probably being Kermit being hit by a car and developing amnesia as a result.

In each, I usually get one good Kermit quote that seems tellingly missing here. The general mood and wonder of the Muppet mythology (yes, I call it mythology because it's world building and poignant, meaningful and wonderful) is here, including Kermit and Piggy's relationship taking a unique turn towards jealousy with the introduction of Jenny in Kermit's life, but in general the film is less joyous and imaginative than many other Muppet works. Part of the difficulty lies with Kermit trying so hard to be different personalities in this one, which goes against his usual ability to remain true to himself throughout any difficulty.

Shocking at the time, the film may now seem clumsy in comparison to modern epics such as the highly charged Toy Story or more violent bloodfests such as Antz, but Henson's meisterwork is nonetheless worthy of acclaim. The foolishness of the Academy in witholding an Oscar in fear of controversy was later exposed by an older and more embittered Kermit, in his 1993 director/writer debut short entitled simply Pondlife, an autobiographical return to form which revealed the story of his consequent lack of self esteem and alcohol problems, leading to his eventual divorce from manhattan co-star Miss Piggy.

Meanwhile Kermit works in a diner, and try to get his play off the ground.This starts off great with a lot of comedy from the whole gang. Dabney Coleman is great for some gut busting laughs. It's too bad that the gang is scattered after the start. Miss Piggy has some hilarious fun, but I prefer to have the whole gang together. They're funnier together.The main live action lead is Juliana Donald who's trying to help Kermit get the play off the ground. She doesn't have any sparks, and looks awkward like she's acting with a bunch of puppets. There are a lot of famous cameos. I'd prefer to have Brooke Shields as the lead. Beside that, there is a lot to love, and a lot of laughs in this Muppets movie.

The Muppet Movie was great, and The Great Muppet Caper was amazingly hilarious! So how do I feel about this one? I think this one is good. It's not bad, it's not great...I think it's good.Synopsis Kermit and the gang are graduating from college, They figure they'll take Kermit's musical, Manhattan Melodies, and put it on Broadway. However, they find out that becoming successful on Broadway is harder than they thought - I guess becoming rich and famous in Hollywood is much easier than making it on Broadway. After having no luck and a little blow up from Kermit, the gang decides to split ways for a little while until the musical is sold on Broadway. Kermit stays in NYC and tries everything he can to get Manhattan Melodies picked up by a Broadway producer. After a while, it's finally sold, and letters are written to everyone so they can come back and prepare for this show. However, there are 2 catches the show will be put in 2 weeks, and Kermit is nowhere to be found. After he sells the musical, he gets hit by a car, receives amnesia, and puts on a new identity, Phillip Phil.This movie has most things that all the other Muppet movies traditionally have, but there are two things that make it seem different. The first is the tone. Something about this New York City, on-location atmosphere gives a very different tone to the Muppets. Or maybe it's the script itself. I don't know, but something about the tone of the movie seems different compared to other Muppet movies. Secondly, there's no breaking the fourth wall in this movie. At first, I thought that was kind of nit-picky. But when you think about it, the Muppets always broke the fourth wall in their productions; they include themselves in our reality. We're watching a movie, and they always let us know that. Here, we're on the outside looking in, just like in most productions. The screen separates us from these characters this time. That's kind of weird.But like I said, there are still a lot of the same things here that are in other Muppet movies. The songs are really nice, the cameo appearances are great, and we get more of those awesome, complicated Muppet scenes! The rat scat scene in the kitchen works really well, and everybody really loves the Muppet babies scene! Remember the TV series Muppet Babies? Yeah, it's based on a scene from this movie, and it's quite charming! Again, it doesn't really have a purpose for the movie, but it's fun and it gave us a great TV show.I have to say something else I love about this movie it's the end when we see a bunch of Jim Henson's Muppets. We see everyone from The Muppet Show, Sesame Street, and one of the characters from Fraggle Rock. It's scenes like this that make me both happy and sad at the same time. I get the sense that Jim Henson wanted his Muppets to always be together. Now that they're all owned by different companies, we'll never see that again. That is, not unless the companies wise up and choose to continue Jim Henson's legacy...But I digress.This isn't the best Muppet movie, but it's still a very good one. I enjoy it a lot, and I think you'll love it as well. You'll laugh, you might even cry (apparently, the saying Goodbye song has the power to make people cry). You'll enjoy this movie just fine!

The Muppets Take Manhattan isn't quite as good as the previous two movies, but it's still very enjoyable. The plot has Kermit and friends graduating from college and deciding to put on a Broadway show, only to arrive in New York and find out that it's harder than they thought. Gotta work to survive in the Big Apple! As with the previous movies, there's no shortage of musical numbers, and there's plenty of famous people in bit parts (including a few as themselves). Since this was the final Muppet movie before Jim Henson died, it makes sense to do what they do at the end of the movie it's as though they've finally achieved their destiny.Yes, this one isn't quite the same as the first two, but I still liked it. Frank Oz, after years of providing the voices of some of the Muppets, proved himself to be a very competent director, and went on to direct fine movies like Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, What About Bob?, In & Out and the original Death at a Funeral.

Of course, their first attempt fails and Kermit (leader of the group and author of the show) blows his top; so, the others all go their separate ways so that he won't have to feel responsible for them. Kermit himself befriends a young wannabe fashion designer making ends meet by serving food at her father's diner (the old man, then, has a line in particularly tortuous non-sequiturs!). We get the usual cameo appearances by a variety of stars Art Carney (as a producer), James Coco (as an overzealous dog owner), Dabney Coleman (as a confidence trickster), Elliott Gould (who was also in THE MUPPET MOVIE 1979), Gregory Hines, Liza Minnelli (as herself &#150; having her portrait at a classy restaurant replaced by Kermit's, sporting fake moustache, as an ostensibly celebrated entrepreneur in a ruse to attract publicity to the Muppets' show), Brooke Shields, and even director John Landis (in possibly the film's funniest scene as a Broadway producer before whom Kermit appears acting streetwise and chummy and hilariously donning shades and an Afro wig!). The other Muppets more or less go through their typical paces, with (regrettably) less space given to Gonzo this time around; while Miss Piggy is something of an acquired taste with me, the scenes in which the latter spies on what she takes to be Kermit's romance with the waitress &#150; and especially her violent reaction to this &#150; are undeniably funny. What disappoints, however, is the climactic show itself (after a fairly redundant midsection wherein Kermit gets amnesia and eventually picks up advertising on Madison Avenue) which, rather than the expected splashy routines, procures nothing more original than the wedding ceremony of Kermit and his eternal flame Miss Piggy!

For one, it remains the only Muppet film not owned by Disney. As of 2008, the film still belongs to 20th Century Fox (CBS Fox at the time of its release) even though Disney owns the rights to the Muppets. Also, this film has a story line that's very non-linear, and events that are otherwise unpredictable.Of course, it's very hard to beat the original Muppet Movie from 1979, especially since that movie had more memorable songs than Manhattan does. However, one way in which The Muppets Take Manhattan is better than The Muppet Movie is perhaps the surprisingly realistic scenarios. In the first movie, all the Muppets really have to do is go to Hollywood, walk into an agent's office, and they are immediately given a Rich & Famous contract. In this movie, the Muppets learn that they actually have to work for their desired success, and it's a lot harder to do that, especially in the entertainment business, than they initially thought. That's an important and often times overlooked message, provided one is willing to suspend the disbelief that the Muppets, being small and made of cloth, don't necessarily have to live in a spacious place or even eat respectively. Above all, their struggle to make it after graduating college creates a very good story. Another note The celebrity cameos in the movie were cool, and they surprisingly managed not to take away the spotlight from the Muppets. That ability right there is a testament to Henson, and how appealing the Muppet characters were even to adults.Where Manhattan falls flat, and this is where I'm sure people will disagree with me, is with some of the key songs, especially in the end. I thought the wedding song He'll Make Me Happy was too somber for such a happy occasion as a wedding. It sounded more like a song that's played at a funeral. Every time I watch this movie, hearing that song makes me unusually depressed, especially when the film begins on such an upbeat number as Together Again and ends happily for that matter. Saying Goodbye was a sad number too, but it fit better into the movie because the Muppets were disbanding and weren't sure they were going to see each other again. That last song was such a let down, and perhaps even added to younger viewers' misery of seeing their favorite Muppets leave the big screen.The Muppets Take Manhattan is overall a good film, and one that marches to the beat of a different drum than the other Muppet films, including the newer ones made after the deaths of Jim Henson and Richard Hunt. Fortunately, the film marches in the same direction as well. I just wished the film ended on a better song that wasn't quite so melancholy. Plus, Disney should have gotten its hands on this film's copyright and given it a proper DVD release. Maybe it will someday. We'll see.

Sure, many of them appear at the wedding, but there should have been some significant roles for Bunsen, Beaker, Beauregard, and Sweetums, and Lips should have been part of The Electric Mayhem in this movie like he was in The Muppet Show's last season and The Great Muppet Caper, and Miss Piggys dog Foo Foo should have been with her as well (after all, Rizzo The Rat, also performed by Steve Whitmire, had a big part in this movie, and he wasn't very well-known at the time).

Tonight I decided to try re-watching some other older Muppet films and was absolutely dumbfounded by how bad The Muppets Take Manhattan was considering the wonderful characters they had to work with in the film. Think about it...Kermit and the gang...and they were boring! The film is all about their trip to New York in order to go to Broadway--but there are simply few laughs and no joy in the film. Most of the songs, apart from the sequel song (which was also re- used in their last film), were bland and forgettable, the laughs are few and the plot isn't particularly engaging. The only good things, the many cool stunts to make the characters seem more real by having them walk seemingly independently of the puppeteers, were nice--but this was not the reason I watched the film.

The first three films starring the famous characters were all made and released into theatres before I was born. I originally saw the first and second installments in the original trilogy, The Muppet Movie and The Great Muppet Caper, around the mid-nineties, as a kid, but didn't see this third one, The Muppets Take Manhattan, until April 2007. This was shortly after I had seen its two predecessors and 1996's Muppet Treasure Island for the first time in many years. This third Muppet movie definitely didn't disappoint me the first time I saw it, and my second viewing nearly three years later may not have impressed me as much, but if not, it certainly didn't go too far downhill.The Muppets' stage musical, Manhattan Melodies, turns out to be a big hit on their college campus. They are graduating from college, so they will soon be leaving, but decide they will all stay together and go to Manhattan to try and get their show on Broadway. After their arrival, they begin searching for a producer, but after many rejections, they finally decide to part and go find jobs. Most of them leave town, but Kermit stays, and is still determined to find the right producer and reunite the Muppet gang. He gets a job at a New York restaurant owned by a man named Pete. The frog quickly befriends Pete's daughter, Jenny, an aspiring fashion designer who currently works at her father's restaurant as a waitress. As Kermit continues his attempts to reach stardom, now with the help of Jenny, he doesn't know that Miss Piggy has secretly stayed in New York and is now spying on him. She begins to see Kermit and Jenny together, and to her it looks like they're getting close, which leads to jealousy! When I saw this movie for the second time, it looked disappointing at first. It seemed a little rushed, unfocused, and maybe even forgettable around the beginning. There are some funny bits during this part of the film, such as Animal chasing a woman through the audience on the college campus, but for a little while, the film seemed bland to me compared to its two predecessors. Fortunately, it wasn't long before that changed. The film is entertaining for the most part, with Saying Goodbye, the poignant song the Muppets sing as they part, and a lot that happens after that. The two funniest parts MIGHT be Miss Piggy's tantrums after she sees Kermit and Jenny hugging, but there were definitely many other times when I laughed, such as poor Fozzie trying to hibernate with other bears. The Muppets still have their charm and comical antics, which obviously also helps carry the movie for the most part, as does the plot, a simple but intriguing one for all ages. There are some weaker moments, such as the Muppet babies sequence, and Juliana Donald's performance as Jenny is lacklustre, but neither of these problems are too significant, and are far from enough to ruin the entire experience.I would say The Muppet Movie, the film that started the franchise in 1979, is the best of the original trilogy, and that seems to be the most popular opinion. This third film is probably the weakest of the three, but all of them are good. Unlike Muppets From Space, the third of the theatrical films in the franchise made after Henson's sad passing, at least The Muppets Take Manhattan is still the Muppets! I won't go into details about what I think of the Muppets' 1999 film, released twenty years after their first one, since I've already explained in my review of it why I found it so disappointing, and even though it does have some appeal, I'm clearly not alone. However, every theatrical movie starring the lovable Muppets that was made during Henson's life is good entertainment for the whole family, even if the second and third installment each showed a slight decline in quality after the one that directly preceded it.

I'm just glad this movie was very entertaining. I borrowed it from the library, and now I have bought it because I can't keep the library's copy forever. In conclusion, I proclaim this is the best movie I've ever seen! In my case, it's even better than Austin Powers in Goldmember, which was my favorite movie!

The gang gets lost in New York, then they break up.  And it climaxes with Kermit getting run over by a taxi and -worst yet- thinking he's an ad executive!This is rough going for the kids and Muppet fans combined, but even so, there are some fine moments.  The final number is very well done, the scene with Gonzo as a lad rocks, and there's a marvelous dance number with Rizzo's gang infesting a kitchen.  Make good use of the fast forward button.

"},{"Title":"Just... wow...","Date":"28 September 2006","Score":"3 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":" When I began watching The Muppets Take Manhattan, the choppy presentation and dialogue had me convinced I was watching something recent, so you can imagine my surprise when I came to the IMDb and read that it was made in 1984. Jim Henson may have ended The Muppet Show when it was at its peak, but spin offs like this and Muppet Babies (which apparently is based upon a very terrible sequence in this film) are the absolute nadir of all things Muppet. I used to wonder why Muppets attracted such derision from such film reviewers as Mr. Cranky, so I am glad that The Muppets Take Manhattan (henceforth TMTM) set me straight on that one. Of course, many series have had a massive drop off in quality when the third episode came around Aliens, RoboCop, The Evil Dead, even Night Of The Living Dead. So while it is no surprise that TMTM is less than The Muppet Movie or The Great Muppet Caper, the surprise lies entirely in how much less than the awesome debut or its slightly lesser follow-up TMTM is. Not only is the music far less satisfying, the scenes that link it all together are utterly terrible.There are, of course, some redeeming and genuinely funny moments, but they are few and far between. The Swedish Chef is great in any scene he inhabits, so thank the spirit of small mercies that he appears in one sequence where his eccentricity is exploited to the fullest. The problem is that there are just no scenes that work. The story, such as it is, revolves around a Broadway musical Kermit is attempting to get produced. He goes through many trials and tribulations along the way, including the sneaking suspicion the viewer has that we have seen this all before. The biggest problem is that Kermit does not have a decent antagonist to work off this time. Charles Durning was cinematic gold as Doc Hopper, the proprietor of a fast food chain who wants to exploit Kermit for his business. Charles Grodin was dynamite as Nicky Holiday, a jewel thief the Muppets must fight in order to save Miss Piggy from a lifetime in prison. The saying is that a hero is only as good as his antagonist, and these two are at least half responsible for the greatness of the previous two films.Charles Grodin also highlights what is wrong with TMTM. Namely, the music sucks. The opening number of the Manhattan Melodies show that is at the centre of TMTM, to put it nicely, makes the drivel that now dominates the airwaves seem coordinated. I might just be letting my peculiar sensitivity to the sounds of words and phrases getting to me, but songs like The Rainbow Connection inspired tears of joy, not irritation. Grodin's big solo during The Great Muppet Caper, while not having the same resonation, he lifts the tone of the film eight steps on his own. He is all class. And if there is one thing TMTM could use, it is rising eight steps in addition to attaining a semblance of class. TMTM also feels severely time-compressed, with the story leaping from scene to scene without any consideration for making sense or giving the story cohesion. Maddox himself pointed out that transition and cohesion make a film feel like a coherent whole rather than a mess of thrown-together pieces. See if you can find them in TMTM.While TMTM does have its guest stars, they are either poorly utilised (Brooke Shields and John Landis), or totally out of their element (Liza Minelli, Dabney Coleman). To call this a waste of time for puppeteer and actor alike is flattery. The absence of an end credits routine is especially sore here, after Animal's go home postscript for The Muppet Movie in particular. Which highlights another problem. The characters are poorly written at best, with none of their individual quirks to be seen or heard. Animal shouts singular words at times, but they have nothing to do with the plot, or the conversation going on around him. Say what you will about set pieces designed to show off characters, but think of Animal's moment after eating the instant growth pills, or his sowwy after the incident when he pulled the window down on top of his fellow Muppets. Now see if you can remember a single memorable moment with an individual Muppet other than Swedish Chef's hilarious misunderstanding of three-dimensional film involving popcorn. Give up? Then you have proved my point.Given that Labyrinth, one of the Henson company's best and most timeless products outside of the Muppets, arrived some two years later, it makes TMTM all the more puzzling. Perhaps this misfire convinced Jim Henson to rethink his strategy regarding character development and usage. Or perhaps the misfire can be attributed to Frank Oz, who at the time had just finished working with George Lucas on what many would agree is the most childish episode in the original Star Wars saga. The writers were also involved with The Great Muppet Caper, so I will let them off the hook for this in spite of the fact that a script is one of the most essential pieces of a film. The production is also substantially improved here, with Muppets appearing capable of moving in ways that were previously beyond them. Had the story and script been better thought-out, TMTM might have been at least comparable to The Great Muppet Caper. As it stands now, it is a great answer to the question of whether Muppets write under the influence, or excrete.For that reason, I gave The Muppets Take Manhattan a three out of ten. Two to denote its actual quality, and a bonus for the Swedish Chef's moments. Without him, this film would be unwatchable. "}]
