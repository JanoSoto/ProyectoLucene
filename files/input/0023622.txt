I watched this for at least the umpteenth time last night - maybe once a year every year since I taped it off TV in 1987. Did it let me down? It hasn't yet and I don't think it ever will I was as captivated by it as I was the first time, and yet it portrays a world, its people and their actions I'll never know, and probably wouldn't want to know either. Some people I know can't watch any film or TV programme a second time and are puzzled when I can - but then could listen with pleasure to a piece of music for a thousandth time.Lubitsch's peerless masterpiece about two crooks (Gaston and Lily) moving amongst high society, falling in love with each other, with high society and with high society in the attractive shape of rich businesswoman Madame Colet falling in love with Gaston is a witty, charming, sophisticated, erudite, relentless, sparkling etc comedy that by the finish has had the effect of defragmenting my mind and deleting the real world for a short while - no mean feat! Every second of every scene carries it's witticisms, not a moment is wasted from the dignified opening with the title song fading into the rubbish boat on the Grand Canal in Venice to the swift orgasmic climax in the taxi in Paris. At the beginning when the stricken Monsieur Philiba rises and falls to the floor of his hotel room again and the Neapolitan music lulls you across a cheesy model set to where the smoking Gaston is urbanely discussing cocktails with a waiter you should know you are in for something special. Ultra demure Kay Francis gets to says Divine twice in a row! Even looking at nothing but a clock for a minute carries a soundtrack bulging with wit and innuendo. Something as unimportant as Herbert Marshall apparently running up and down Kay Francis's stairs (on camera, in mirrors or in sound only) turns out to be an in-joke - he had only one leg. Other running gags make you smile after the film has long finished, such as Positively Tonsils and No Potatoes. And to think about this film even years later it's always with the lilting, insistent, mocking romantic background music! But I could go on and on, there's enough in this for 10 films of today to borrow if they could make them like this any more. Frasier on TV has been the closest in sophisticated comedy in recent times, but even so it couldn't match TIP's compact inventiveness. Out of the 97 million movies I've watched this is definitely in my top 5 favourites.It's a pity that so many people can so easily be put off by black and white photography and bygone stars who they've never heard of; in this case what they're missing out on is near perfection, and again another film that will still be available when all of the undisciplined uncensored in-your-face films of today are forgotten.

WHY?","Date":"20 September 2002","Score":"54 out of 69 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Romance","Review":"  So funny, sexy, subtle and sublime, this film only gets better with each viewing, BUT it's not available in ANY format! WHY?Ernst Lubitsch used Laszlo Aladar's play The Honest Finder as a springboard for one of his most delightful early-1930s Paramount confections. Herbert Marshall and Miriam Hopkins play Gaston and Lily, a pair of Parisian thieves, both disguised as nobility, who decide to rob lovely perfume company executive Mariette Colet (Kay Francis); Gaston gets a job as Mariette's confidential secretary, while Lily installs herself as the woman's typist. Love rears its head, forcing Gaston to choose between marriage to Mariette and a fast getaway with Lily. Filled with marvelous throwaway gags and sophisticated innuendo, Trouble in Paradise was described by one critic as as close to perfection as anything I have ever seen in the movies.For over seven decades this film has been unmatched in the realm of sophisticated farce. Films from THE AWFUL TRUTH to THE LADY EVE to SOME LIKE IT HOT are sublime on their more modest social scale and in their basic Americanness. By contrast, TROUBLE IN PARADISE has all the class and Continental elegance one associates with the Paramout of the 1930s. Made before the Production Code clampdown of 1934, this Lubitsch masterpiece shows his talent for sly sexual innuendo at its most witty and polished. The result is pure caviar, only tastier. The story tells of two jewel thieves, Gaston (Marshall) and Lily (Hopkins), who together work at bilking a merry widow, Mariette Colet (Francis), out of a small fortune. They secure jobs as her secretary and maid, but trouble begins in paradise when Gaston starts falling for his lovely prey and when one of her many suitors (Horton), a former victim of Gaston's, begins to recognize Mme. Colet's new secretary. The many laughs in this consistently delightful souffle come not only from Raphaelson's marvelous screenplay but also from Lubitsch's supple visual wit. On one hand there's delightful repartee about a former secretary who enjoyed an antique bed a bit too much, and on the other we have the sexy silhouette of Gaston and Mariette cast over a chaise lounge. From the opening shot of an operatic gondolier who turns out to be a garbageman to a police report about theft and tonsils translated for Italian officials, this film is full of unforgettable moments of merriment. The cast, too, is peerless. In one of his earliest Hollywood efforts, Herbert Marshall does the greatest work of his career. Too often maligned for playing stodgy consorts to dynamic star actresses such as Garbo, Davis, and Shearer, Marshall here gets to display his impeccable timing and supple grace. Frequently hilarious, his quiet approach and crushed velvet voice still let him remain suave throughout. Even Cary Grant would be hard pressed to match this portrayal. (He'd be too frantic.) Kay Francis, too, that popular sufferer of countless women's films with her twoublesome r's, gives of her very best. With her sleek, glamorous style and elegantly wry line readings, she is light, sexy, and totally captivating. Her doorway caresses and her finger-snapping seduction of Gaston are priceless. Miriam Hopkins was luckier in that she had many more chances to display her comic flair in film. Today one of the most underrated and unfairly maligned stars of the 1930s, the brittle, feisty Hopkins can rattle off witty banter at a breakneck pace or she can be deliciously languorous and coy. Her enjoyment of her own sexuality is heady even today and the thieving competition between Gaston and Lily, in which escalating crimes turn into escalating passion, remains one of the greatest scenes of foreplay ever caught on film. Ruggles and Horton prove yet again that they are two of the greatest farceurs in Hollywood, and the rest of the cast is equally choice. (One standout is Leonid Kinskey, whose bit as a leftist radical only foregrounds the satiric anarchy of the entire film.) Beautifully handled from start to finish, gleamingly shot and full of Dreier's incredible Art Deco designs, TROUBLE IN PARADISE is Lubitsch's greatest film and one of the indisputable highlights of comic cinema Directed by Ernst Lubitsch, the master of sophisticated comedy, Trouble in Paradise (1932) is the most accomplished example of the Lubitsch Touch for stylish innuendo and sly wit. With a script by Samson Raphaelson and Grover Jones, Lubitsch derives sparkling humor from the lusty (Pre-Code) love triangle among two jewel thieves, Lily and Gaston, and their intended victim, Mme. Colet. From the opening image of a garbage gondola's gliding through the picturesque Venice canals, Lubitsch makes light of the notion that amorality lies beneath the glossy exteriors of the rich. Elegantly sending up idealized movie romance, Gaston and Lily fall in love as they attempt to rob each other blind over an intimate dinner, sealing a bond between two scoundrels. Such Lubitsch details as a hand's hanging a Do Not Disturb sign on a doorknob and the shadow of a couple cast on a bed neatly communicate the nature of Gaston's relationships with Lily and Mme. Colet, complementing the clever dialogue, spiked with nimble come-ons and ripostes, and delivered with aplomb by Herbert Marshall, Miriam Hopkins, and Kay Francis. Praised for its smoothly imaginative technique and comic invention, Trouble in Paradise burnished Lubitsch's reputation as Paramount's premier purveyor of 1930s Continental class, and it is still considered one of the best adult comedies ever made.

Turner Classic Movies broadcasts Casablanca, Now Voyager, Citizen Kane, Philadelphia Story, Adam's Rib, African Queen and Bringing Up Baby 10 times for every time this film is shown. It is an injustice that this film is shown so rarely. (I would recommend to TCM that they show their classics less frequently and a number of less well-known films such as this more often.)Trouble in Paradise is a comedy counterpart to a melodrama; it is a romantic melo-comedy. It is unlike any other Lubitsch film with which I am familiar. In fact, it is difficult for me to think of any film with which to compare this masterpiece. The cast is outstanding, each delivering dialog in mock melodramatic style. The soundtrack, the editing, and especially the sublime writing all combine to produce a unique, satirical melodrama parody. Perhaps this film was the model for many later films that hoped to attain the same comic irony, but seem humorless to me. The key seems to be that the actors do not take themselves seriously, but they portray characters who do.Everything about this film is fabulous. I cannot fathom how anybody could suggest this film is outdated in any manner because it captures the ambiance of an era so perfectly. The era is past, but not this film! Do period films made today seem outdated to them? I do not need to heap redundant praise on a film that other commentators have described so well. So that you know where I'm coming from - I admit to being a HUGE Lubitsch fan. The Shop Around the Corner and Ninotchka are also among my very favorite films.

It's all rather droll until Lady H. picks up the telephone to inform her staff at home that she'll be late for dinner. The director, Ernst Lubitsch, cuts to the other side of the conversation--and we see a fat landlady in a hovel crawling with cats looking baffled at the receiver and saying, Whaddaya sayin'? At that moment, you know that Lubitsch and his ideal-mate screenwriter, Samson Raphaelson, are playing a pretty sophisticated game--and in the nearly seventy years since this movie, comedy directors from Billy Wilder to George Cukor to Woody Allen have been playing catch-up.TROUBLE IN PARADISE remains the most perfect of all sound comedies--it makes you feel as if you had consumed some celestial compound of champagne and helium. The surprise of the movie today is not the pleasure of its Lubitschian elegance, but the fact that the movie is screamingly funny at every turn--Lubitsch's smart bombs never miss their mark. And for all the applications of his touch we're grateful for, Lubitsch never again made anything so flawless--in these less-than-ninety minutes, he and Raphaelson turned dialogue comedy into Mozartean music.

She checks -- at the dinner table no less -- realizes it is gone and with the admiration of one thief for another leaps into his lap. Darling! she says. No one has to guess what she has in mind, although it is all done with the wit and brio that the Lubitsch Touch, refers to.It's great to have this film readily available and the DVD version includes an informative and enlightening commentary (Marshall only had one leg and his lurching walk made a certain speedy cutting necessary that helps give the film it's light, speedy quality).Lubitsch also made Shop Around the Corner, remade by Nora Ephron as You've Got Mail, and Ninotcha, with Greta Garbo.

Pay attention to the small details and you will be amply rewarded well beyond the actual plot (hint doors, clocks, stairs). The timing of every single scene is pure joy, the characters are all delightful, and the sets are out of this world! Clothing, household furnishings, hair/make-up/accessories are all simply astonishing. You don't even realize how important they are as part of the set piece until the 3rd or 4th viewing, so captivating is the actual plot and the desire to follow the characters' paths throughout the film.It is a screwball comedy, to be sure, but it is also a statement of the times it depicts and when it was made. In 1932, the US was still struggling with the national economic depression, and people probably ached for a little getaway. This film, set in Paris (and other equally exotic&#151;especially in 1932&#151;places), must have provided the perfect balm for people looking for both validation of desperate times call for desperate measures (Lily and Gaston are, after all, thieves!) and a whimsical escape into another, more glamorous world than the one most people experienced in 1932.

The story of ritzy jewel thieves Herbert Marshall and Miriam Hopkins scheming to bilk French cosmetics heiress Kay Francis out of the bulk of her negotiable possessions, it proceeds with aristocratic aplomb.Both Marshall and Hopkins could prove tediously brittle and a bit stale in later movies that relaxed into a more casual American style.  Here, their mannered elocution and studied stage-business come off elegantly (this is, after all, a comedy of manners).  Charlie Ruggles and Edward Everett Horton, a couple of fussbudgets wooing Francis, ably hold up the periphery of the action.Trouble in Paradise -- a de luxe, Art Deco paradise -- stands as the touchstone of the fabled Lubitsch touch, that glancing, faintly suggestive command of nuance, such as a pair of shadows falling across a bedspread (no more need be said, or shown).  In this comic operetta, even the blithe background music sings out in leitmotifs.  Other emigres from middle Europe brought a foreboding Teutonic look and tone to Hollywood, especially to film noir.

Kay Francis is her soigne best as the target of the jewel thieves.....although she could not pronounce her rs, she was the personification of chic and designers had a field day dressing her for her films.  Miriam Hopkins may not have been the best choice for the part of Marshall's partner in crime; she never seems quite  in sync with the rest of the cast.  She had a reputation for being difficult and it shows just a bit here.....but that does not take anything away from the overall excellence of this movie.  The censors had not cracked down in 1932 like they would in the coming years and this allows for some risque situations (for the time) which are pure delight.

This was the case at Paramount in particular, who imported many of their directors from the continent and deliberately cultivated that sophisticated European flavour. German maestro Ernst Lubitsch was the most treasured of their acquisitions, and during the early 1930s fulfilled the studio's expectations for urbane comedies set among the idle and relatively carefree rich of far-off Europe.Lubitsch is &#x96; and was &#x96; best known for his so-called touch, a subtle, tasteful and very intelligent manner of hinting at the various sexual shenanigans that his characters continually get up to. But it is doing the man rather a disservice to focus so much on this, as there was a lot more to his style and to his career. Besides, a lot of the credit for the touch should go to writer Samson Raphaelson, as it was in the Raphelson-penned works when this clever innuendo was at its sharpest. The humour in Trouble in Paradise is all of a by-the-way fashion, with bizarrely comical phrases slipped neatly into the dialogue. What Lubitsch really does is match up with Raphaelson's sauciness on the visual side of things, dissolving from Herbert Marshall and Miriam Hopkins canoodling on a couch, to the same couch now empty, to a Do not disturb sign being hung on a door. But it's not all about sex. What's nice about Trouble in Paradise is that despite the protagonists being a pair of thieves, we never see anything stolen. The thefts are just implied with a nonchalant revelation after the event.Consistently, Lubitsch's visual style is throughout one of taste and elegance. Lubitsch's sound films up to now had mostly been musicals, and although Trouble in Paradise is not a musical it is almost operatic in its stylised pace, often alternating between slow and fast scenes like the movements of a work of classical music. Lubitsch doesn't use many elaborate techniques, but simply manages the pace through careful coaching of the actors' motion and vocal delivery. The camera rarely moves, but when he does it is generally a discreet flourish to maintain the necessary rhythm. An example is when we cut from Kay Francis nattering on the phone straight into Marshall and Hopkins arguing. The shot begins with the camera dollying in on the pair, keeping the snappy pace going across the two scenes. The opening scene is smooth as a gondola on the water, the camera languidly tracking from the rubbish of the city, to the aftermath of a robbery, over to an gorgeous shot of Herbert Marshall , gazing out from a balcony with a look of exquisite melancholy in his eyes.Which leads me onto the players themselves. It is always a joy to watch Herbert Marshall, one of the best lead men of the 30s who has become something of an obscurity today. He is utterly suited to the style and pace of Trouble in Paradise, his movements elegant as a violinist playing largo, and his voice quiet yet commanding of our attention. He is superbly matched, in an opposites-attract scenario, by a vivacious Miriam Hopkins. These days Hopkins is often dismissed as an amateurish ham, but as Trouble in Paradise demonstrates she did everything with a pinch of deliberate irony. I love the way she fires off angry tirades, her face almost rigid except for the occasional fiery flash of an eyebrow. Kay Francis, the third corner in the love triangle, is stunningly beautiful but otherwise rather bland and forgettable, although perhaps this is the point. As to the supporting players, Edward Everett Horton is always nice to see, although he is a bit underused here, and clearly hadn't quite worked out his brilliant comic persona yet. C. Aubrey Smith on the other hand, as familiar a face in thirties Hollywood as Ned Sparks, is at his very best. Being a pompous villain seems to suit him far better than the venerable patriarchs he usually portrayed.Movies like Trouble in Paradise were popular of course because they offered escapism at a time of domestic strife. Today it remains a smart, witty, and very beautifully made confection. It is of course not nearly as touching as the raw emotion and sincerity of Warner Brothers' and Columbia's depression-era offerings, but it is nevertheless utterly enjoyable, undemanding, and treats us to the same delicate atmosphere of continental wit that it did to audiences of the time.

Prior to this, he made many very funny silents and a couple of dramas and musicals. But it was on Trouble in Paradise where his directorial strengths came into play. With Noel Coward-like sophistication, and Howard Hawks-like timing, Lubitsch rewrites the rules of romantic comedy. While this film may not be as well-known as his Ninotchka or To Be Or Not To Be, it is certainly funnier, and more sexually suggestive.Lubitsch is at his best when he has his leads (Herbert Marshall, Miriam Hopkins, and Kay Francis) just banter between themselves. His suggestive actions and subtleties are far funnier than straight slapstick.Marshall and Hopkins are a couple of con artists who meet while trying to con each other. They fall in love and get married. They then fall into an opportunity to con Francis. Francis and Marshall fall in love, and you can probably guess the rest of the plot.The cast is first rate. Marshall walks through this film never losing his sense of sophistication, even when he knows the jig is up. Hopkins turns on the charm as needed and is hilarious in a small bit with Eva McKenzie at the top of the film. Francis is beautiful as their high spending foil.Nice work is also turned in by Charlie Ruggles, Edward Everett Horton and C. Aubrey Smith. And when is it not nice to see Robert Greig play another butler? I must admit that until I saw this film the other night I was not too familiar with it.

It is not so much a laugh riot like Chaplin's best bits as it is extremely clever, to the point of being transcendent. Its tone reminds me very much of Jean Renoir's 1939 'Rules of the Game,' and Bunuel's comedies, although it doesn't have Bunuel's 'cruelty' (as master critic Andre Bazin would put it).  It is just a work of art which most 'non-artsy' people will dismiss as 'just another clever comedy' because works of art annoy them (and they don't see why they should be bothered with applying the energy needed to understand them), while 'artsy' people will overrate it, and rightly so. Overrated or not, Lubitch's film is a joy to behold; you are glad it exists. As you're watching, you know you're being hit with valuable not-necessarily verbal information left and right. You know it's worth reseeing many times because you will get a different blend of perspectives from it everytime (much like a great piece of music). The essence of what makes it 'great,' as opposed to 'just another comedy' is this  'Trouble in Paradise' completely destroys harmful romantic myths while affirming true romanticism (think Stendhal, Proust, Lessing, Nabokov) in the very way it is made, its style. This is what it does and it is an extremely important and purifying process for those who go through it and implicitly embrace its implicit principles. But, as it is, nobody'll get to see it anyway because it's not out on video, so what the hell am I writing for? To get all 3 of the people who will read this page in the next year to demand that it be put out for public consumption. Long live democracy!

The film is fast, sexy, effortless and absolutely charming.People always refer to the Lubitsch touch when talking about the famous director's films, and I understand completely what they mean. There's something about his films that's common to all of them but is very hard to describe. It has something to do with tone -- all of his films feel like they're perfectly balanced between humor, sentimentality, pathos and melancholy. They're funny, but none of them feel like insignificant fluff; there's an underlying strain of melancholy running through all of them, yet none of them make the mistake of taking the world too seriously.

Gandhi begins a hunger strike in Poona prison.BIRTHS Glenn Gould, Dick Gregory, Robert Reed, William Christopher.KEVIN 'Grand Hotel' was excellent, but I'd give the title of Best Film of 1932 to this Ernst Lubitsch essential. Every moment of this breezy comedy is pitch perfect. I'd buy it if Criterion didn't price their DVDs so damn high. Herbert Marshall, who we just saw in 'Blonde Venus,' is the enormously likable gentleman thief Gaston Monescu. Miriam Hopkins, so good in 'Jekyll & Hyde,' is so perfect as Lily that it's hard to imagine any other actress playing the part. Kay Frances is very good, sweet and alluring at the same time, but Marshall and Hopkins are so beyond perfect that Frances becomes the least memorable of the three main players. (But they barely edge her out.) I'm glad we watched 'Marriage Circle,' because I'm really getting a sense of what the Lubitsch Touch was all about. His films have a very distinctive pace and look, especially when it comes to the actors. Lubitsch basically acted the scene out for his actors and they would just duplicate what he did. As Peter Bogdanovich mentions on the DVD introduction, that's why the actors in his films demonstrated a style that they didn't have working with any other director. There is almost always something going on on screen, even if the camera is static. I don't know which scene in the movie is my favorite. One great scene has Marshall and Hopkins substituting pickpocketing for foreplay.DOUG 'Trouble in Paradise' is a fantastic, witty, charming, enormously entertaining film. We watched it twice. This is the first REAL screwball comedy, and the REAL best picture of 1932. An incredibly charming cast is on display Herbert Marshall, who we JUST SAW in 'Blonde Venus,' plays the lead here as master thief Gaston Monescu, the Man who walked into the Bank of Constantinople and walked out WITH the Bank of Constantinople. As part of his thieving talents, Gaston is also a master of misdirection the way he deals with Giron (C. Aubrey Smith) and Filiba (Edward Everett Horton) as they try to fool him into giving himself away is something to behold. We saw Miriam Hopkins in 'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,' and she is wonderfully charming here as the pickpocket who steals Gaston's heart. Pickpocketing as foreplay; I love it. Kay Frances, who we saw briefly in 'The Cocoanuts' and will probably never see again (most unfortunate), plays wonderfully opposite Marshall and makes a very good foil to Hopkins. She plays a society woman who has no problem buying a F125,000 handbag DURING THE GREAT DEPRESSION (an act she is chastised by a Bolshevik for early in the film), and acts all surprised when she finds F100,000 sitting in her safe. Although we never feel too bad about her getting robbed, we never hate the woman herself, and we are genuinely not sure if Gaston is going to end up with her or with Lily. Post-Code, these two lovebird larceneers would have had to be arrested, punished, or somehow repent for their deeds and give up crime. Fortunately, we are spared such petty resolutions, and are instead given a happy ending for two criminals who can just continue being criminals, and we wouldn't have them any other way. The DVD includes an intro from Peter Bogdanovich, where he discusses the fabled Lubitsch Touch, and how Lubitsch would act out each scene himself for the actors. That must have been what made 'Marriage Circle' work so well. Billy Wilder has said that he owes everything to Ernst Lubitsch, and he does. So does Woody Allen for that matter. This is easily my favorite film of 1932.Last film Blonde Venus (1932). Next film Red Dust (1932).

It takes place in an exquisite Continental milieu where the characters' desires for sex and money can be seen as a desire for the finer things in life. The comedy consistently sparkles, and the few serious moments are delicate and understated.In a prologue set in Venice, sophisticated thieves Gaston (Herbert Marshall) and Lily (Miriam Hopkins) pretend to be aristocrats, then fall in love when they realize one another's true natures. A couple of years later, in Paris, they decide to target an heiress, Mariette Colet (Kay Francis). But, as always happens in this kind of movie, Mariette falls in love with Gaston. So who will end up with whom? And who will end up with the money?This is the first Ernst Lubitsch movie I've seen, but I can already tell what is meant by the Lubitsch touch. The movie is packed with clever sight gags, sophisticated and sly dialogue, and an impressively witty use of sound and music. Though Marshall receives third billing behind his female costars, he gives the standout performance, almost impossibly suave. But the women are also good with comedy, and contrast nicely with one another; Francis is elegant, Hopkins, impish.The sets and costumes create a gorgeous, enticing Art Deco world that's a little hard to leave when the movie ends. Yet the short running time (82 minutes) is necessary. Otherwise, there'd be a risk that the movie might drag and turn heavy, and that would never do. Trouble in Paradise was always meant to be a glittering bauble&#151;and always will be.

Result - TROUBLE IN PARADISE.This scintillating & rarely seen comedy - director Ernst Lubitsch's masterpiece - is the epitome of frothy pre-Code sophistication. An utter delight from start (operatic-singing garbage gondolier) to finish (pocket picking in a taxi), the film should leave the viewer breathless in admiration.Lubitsch relied heavily on the intelligence of his audience. He knew that a delicate touch would be appreciated by those able to anticipate & understand the nuances of his humor. The fact that this worked so beautifully only two years after Hollywood fully embraced sound pictures shows the genius of the director's craft. This was to become his favorite film, and for very good reason.The plot, about a couple of adroit jewel thieves & the wealthy woman they attempt to fleece, is almost lighter-than-air, so effervescent is the quality of the writing. The performances add to this feeling of airy lightheadedness.Herbert Marshall is the very picture of moral ambiguity - the most larcenous situations cause not even the lift of an eyebrow; as a ladies' man, he positively oozes suavity from every pore. His partner in crime, Miriam Hopkins, is a comic study in barely controlled passion and the perfect match for Marshall; their intimate tit-for-tat body burgling is a refreshing take on a romantic prelude.Kay Francis, the center of the filmic storm, is pure stylish glamour; her sleek demeanor is entrancing as she deals with the other players, most of whom are interested in her millions.Rounding out the cast is a quartet of prime character actors befuddled Edward Everett Horton & bemused Charlie Ruggles as Miss Francis' suitors; unctuous Robert Greig as her butler; and old Sir C. Aubrey Smith, marvelously fierce as the chairman of her corporate board of directors. Each is superb in his role.Movie mavens will recognize Leonid Kinskey as an angry Russian radical.Interestingly, when Paramount tried to reissue TROUBLE IN PARADISE in 1935, the rules of the newly enforced Production Code forbade it. The film's full cargo of innuendo kept it from entering any redistribution harbor for almost 30 years.

First things first thank you to TCM for showing this recently. Of course I taped it, and of course I've practically worn the tape out by now, a month later.Point #2 something is terribly wrong in Paradise if the peak era of his work, 29-33, remains in shadow today. Where are the VHS/DVD releases of these wonderful films? Nowhere that I can find them; hopefully the good folks at Turner will continue reviving the early sound Lubitsches. I waited 25 years to see this one again, and the wait was not in vain. Those 25 years put a bit of snow on my roof, but they also allowed me to drink in the ambrosia that is this film with a bit more appreciation than I had at 16. And what intoxicating ambrosia it is! Script, performances, directorial vision are all exquisite. The leads are inspired (oh, for a night with Kay Francis!); the supporting players, expertly calibrated farceurs. The utilization of music as ironic counterpoint to the visuals rivals Clair; the title song, sung over the opening credits, will make your heart race, and break, at the same time. And the look of the film (Art Deco, lovingly handrubbed to a burnished glow) will linger with you forever.Again and again, Lubitsch pulls rabbits out of hats scenes like the deepening of Herbert Marshall and Kay Francis' relationship from business to pleasure 'seen' in a clock face are emblematic of what makes this such a special film. Its story is slight, frothy, very nearly silly; yet Lubitsch's knowing observation of small, telling details makes it magical. TROUBLE is not a timeless film, anchored as it is to a very specific time (Long Ago) and place (Far Away), which only deepens its charm and its seductive tugging on the audience's sleeve. I've watched it three times in a night, and three times more the following night - not behavior I usually exhibit. But the siren call of its lively, civilized wit is such that I'm hitting 'rewind' the moment it ends - I don't want to break the spell and return to reality just yet.

This is a remarkable example of the sort of sophisticated, innuendo-laced light comedy that Hollywood was making until the Hays Code put an end to them. There is not one crude line; we never see anything sexier than a kiss, and they are far from torrid. But this movie implies sex, and more interestingly sexual intrigue and passion, throughout. The duologue is uniformly wonderful, with lines that you will never forget. I can't say there is any real substance to this picture. There isn't. But it is gossamer of the finest quality. Herbert Marshall, who usually strikes me as a cypher, here shows what made him so popular for awhile he has a wonderful voice, which he can shape and mold to imply whatever he wants. Miriam Hopkins' charms still generally elude me, though she is good in the opening scene. Kay Francis is much more enjoyable here delivering double-entendres than in the sort of heavy parts she got assigned to too often. In short, everything is wonderful.I couldn't believe how fast this movie flew by. There was not a dead moment. This is not a celluloid masterpiece, another Citizen Kane or Les Règles du jeu.

Under the soon-to-be Hays Production Code, this narrative of con-artists flagrantly breaks levels of decency, sexual innuendo and criminality that the code was set up to eradicate. Lily (Miriam Hopkins) and Gaston Monescu (Herbert Marshall) join forces in Venice to become a couple of grifters, they live together in sin and have no scruples when stealing is concerned. They move to Paris where they target the famous perfume manufacturer Madame Mariette Colet (Kay Francis), finding confidence with the heiress, Gaston becomes her secretary, and play the long game in consuming as much of her wealth as possible.With romantic entanglements becoming increasingly apparent, Colet practically offers Gaston a position as a gigolo. This menage-e-trois - love triangle - complicates the situation, as relationships become heated. It's a masterwork of comedy, with Hopkins being the most delightful and versatile of the cast. Her plucky attitude, and effervescent presence gives the film a fantastic tone - in one scene she sits at the bedside of Colet, and anxiously holds her hands under her legs so as to stop herself from stealing the jewels on the bedside table.Based on Hungarian playwright Aladar Laszlo's stage work, 'The Honest Finder', this was the first of Ernst Lubitsch's films given the mantle of having The Lubitsch Touch, this is a perfect example of creative film making. His camera glides through scenes, and from window to window in some scenes (perhaps nothing to a modern audience, but an incredible achievement in 1930's cinematic production). This is possibly the finest film in the pre-code era, and a complete joy in all respects. As it was produced before Will Hays's iron fist came crashing down on Hollywood production, the film doesn't insult its audience with a moral conclusion, as the thieves happily disappear into the sunset, laughing at the ill-gotten stash.

All the sexual innuendos keep you intrigued by not making everything blatantly obvious. That's the problem with most comedies; writers have any respect for the audience like the ones of this movie.

It is a truly beautiful-looking film with very stylish photography and some of the most exquisite costumes and sets of any 1930s film. Lubitsch again proves what a talented director he was, his direction here being full of class and subtlety in a way that only he could do, Trouble in Paradise has Lubitsch's trademark and distinctive style all over it. Trouble in Paradise is also brilliantly scripted, one of the best of any film of the 1930s to me. The comedy parts really sparkle in humour, the best parts being hysterical, and the romantic parts are really sweet and heart-warming without being too sentimental, both components beautifully balanced in a typically(for a Lubitsch film) sophisticated way. Few scripts from 1930s films were this sophisticated even. The story draws you right in from the start and doesn't stop, the warm humour, subtle touches, sophistication, classy charm and emotion were just captivating that few other romantic comedies managed this well. And the acting is close to faultless, Herbert Marshall makes for a charming leading man in a performance that is among his best, Kay Francis is glamour personified and Miriam Hopkins has fun in her role. Character actors Charles Ruggles and Edward Everett Horton are very funny, though Horton was ever so slightly under-utilised, and C. Aubrey Smith is effectively fierce. In conclusion, romantic comedy at its best in a film as close to perfection you can get. 10/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"A little dated, but pure Lubitsch.","Date":"7 June 2014","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Romance","Review":" I recently watched and fell in love with Ernst Lubitsch's To Be Or Not To Be. It was my first film of his and I knew instantly that he would become a favourite of mine once I saw more. Trouble In Paradise definitely has the razor sharp wit and sardonic approach that the aforementioned classic has, but it's also perhaps held back by the limitations and simpicity of 1930s cinema. While it does have creative editing and whip pans at times, it's much dryer, living in quite an unexciting place despite a rather exciting premise. The character work isn't as deep but it's certainly entertaining. That's all Trouble In Paradise is, just an episode. And for that, it's worth it. You may not feel deeply for the characters, but their situations and dilemmas are tense and funny. I can already see the trademark of a Lubtisch film. Characters get so close to being found out that they practically admit to it before they outsmart the villain. Despite the ruggedness of its time and its tendency to skip around its characters, Trouble In Paradise painted a welcome grin on my face. Lubitsch's European touch gives Hollywood an edgy shine.8/10 "},{"Title":"Lubitsch just made better movies than most directors","Date":"19 December 2011","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Romance","Review":" People who say they don't like Black and White movies have never seen a Lubitsch picture.

Directors were forced to finesse matters of morality, and some succeeded better than others. Ernst Lubitsch succeeded best of all, and the German émigré's Trouble in Paradise may be the finest example.Consider the fact that the male lead, played by Herbert Marshall, seduces two women and at various times lives with them, without marrying either. Moreover, Marshall plays a professional thief (walked into the Bank of Constantinople and walked out *with* the Bank of Constantinople) who hooks up with a lovely pickpocket (Miriam Hopkins); they conspire to swindle a wealthy and equally lovely perfume magnate (Kay Francis). In the hands of most directors, this would be the setup for a screwball farce. Trouble in Paradise is that, certainly, but so much more. It's a strikingly sophisticated comedy of manners in which love is mocked and sex is intimated in a dazzling variety of ways.Lubitsch and screenwriter Samson Raphaelson would later team up for the brilliant The Shop Around the Corner with Jimmy Stewart. It too is a comic masterpiece, but they could never surpass Trouble in Paradise.

It is a comedy but the comedy is a lot more subtle than anyone may think.It is about a crook who meets a thief and they fall in love but then they plan schemes that are so big it is amazing how easy they seem to be. They plan an operation that would capture a fair amount of cash, and some jewels, from the heiress and boss of the first cosmetic (in those days it was mainly perfume) business in Paris and probably the world. It sounds like L'Oreal so much that the only difference between the young widow who is heading the business and Ms Bettencourt who has finally been court-ordered out of freely managing and using her money is their age.Yet that did not prevent the gay photographer who had been her late husband's lover to take her over and manipulate her like a piece a play dough. Never too old to be submitted to that game.The second difference is that the crooks are a couple and the danger for them is that the man may fall for the heiress, really fall I mean, and that solution is caressed for a short while but the dramatic suspense it creates is short lived in the end.The third interest is that the film clearly shows how the main board member of the business is using his position to enrich himself with discrete transfers from the business accounts to his own knowing that the heiress or boss or widow will never understand the procedure but the new secretary who is the crook and thief who infiltrated the business to get to the lady's safe knows about it at once and can reveal it. It takes a crook to know another.But then how funny it is to see the victim of all these rotten crooks refusing to call the police because of the scandal it would create. They did not know yet that a good and deep scandal is the best publicity for a business, as long as the scandal does show any support to the wrong side, and there Lubitsch is a very subtle man. The crooked board member who is stealing from the business on a regular basis has a secret first name he does not like. In 1932, guess twice what it could be? Adolf of course, and even if you write it the French way Adolphe it does not change and in the film it sounds just like Adolf, the other Adolf of 1932 who was starting to loom high over Europe.But a funny film after all far from such political considerations.

Basically in Venice, Gaston Monescu (Herbert Marshall) a master European thief who masquerades as a baron, Lily Vautier (Miriam Hopkins) is a beautiful thief and pickpocket also pretending to be higher in class, they meet and fall in love as they become a team. Leaving Venice for Paris they plan to steal a great fortune from the famous perfume manufacturer Madame Mariette Colet (Kay Francis), Monescu is her secretary and moved the cash into a safe, he begins having feelings for her as well. The plan has a hitch though as Monescu recognises one of Colet's suitors, François Filiba (Edward Everett Horton), eventually with the help of another suitor, The Major (Charles Ruggles), that Filiba mistook him for a doctor, and he then remembers the thief robbing him while pretending to be a doctor, so Monescu and Lily plan to get the cash from the safe to make a getaway. The Mayor is holding a dinner party, but Colet cannot decide whether to attend or have sex with Monsecu, and Lily has caught on that he has fallen for her rival, so after confronting him she steals all the safe money herself, and Colet meanwhile refuses to believe from Filiba his story of her love being a fraud and thief. She does suggestively probe Monescu like she knows something, and he does confess he is a fraud and that the safe has been emptied, but he claims he did it alone, and he also suggests the manager of her business Adolph J. Giron (C. Aubrey Smith) has stolen from the firm over time. Lily does come clean in front of Monescu and Colet that she stole the safe money, there is an argument, but eventually Colet allows the two thieves to leave together, in the car together he wants to make amends, and he reveals that he stole a valuable necklace that Lily had her eye on, she takes it from him and they embrace each other with a hug. Also starring Robert Greig as Jacques the Butler, Leonid Kinskey as The Communist and George Humbert as Waiter. The film is certainly scripted well, it has style, the acting is good and it has some interesting designs for costumes and sets, I admit it was hard to follow on occasions because of the upper class and sophistication lifestyle stuff, but most of it did make me laugh, and the love story stuff was fine as well, so it is a worthwhile romantic comedy.

However, that's not to say the film is without its faults. Miriam Hopkins, for example, comes across more as irritating than charming and her fast patter talk fails to draw a response from me. Herbert Marshall, on the other hand, is dazzling for a change--a far cry from the stodgy performer he became in his later years. He plays Gaston with grace, humor and considerable comic skill and is a revelation to me as a performer.Another revelation is Kay Francis. I'm not an admirer of Miss Francis--always feeling she was sub-par as a dramatic actress--but here she exhibits her own fair share of charm, grace and skill as a light comedienne. She outshines Hopkins in every scene and easily holds her own against Marshall. This is probably one of her best overall performances under Ernst Lubitsch's clever direction.The story is a trifle concerning two jewel thieves (Marshall and Hopkins) posing as nobility while they work for a wealthy woman (Francis) with the intention of bilking her of her fortune. Charlie Ruggles and Edward Everett Horton do some nimble work as fussy suitors who are seldom on speaking terms with each other. All of the comedy angles are handled skillfully by the director, beginning with the opening scene of a gondolier singing a glorious romantic aria while loading his garbage boat in a Venetian canal. Much of the humor that follows is in the same bent.Shows its age as a film with its art deco settings and slow pace but picks up considerable speed during the last half-hour.

While I feel it does fall short of the real excellence that the very best golden age comedies possess (films like Capra's Meet John Doe and Sturges' Sullivan's Travels, for example), it's really just by a nose.Gaston (Herbert Marshall) and Lily (Miriam Hopkins) are thieves in love who travel the European continent in search of quarry. They find a particularly troublesome mark in perfume magnate Madame Colet (Kay Frances), and Lily's belief that Gaston truly loves the woman he's conning threatens to disrupt their happy (unmarried) union.There's a lot here that would have offended some audiences of the day, and that wouldn't have been allowed a few years later. Gaston and Lily clearly cohabit without the bonds of matrimony, and they are allowed to escape with their loot in the end. The relationship between Gaston and Madame Colet is interesting because society in general considers it sexual but we don't really get the idea that they have consummated their relationship.I didn't care hugely for Kay Frances in the lead support role actually, that did some damage to the film for me. She was not someone who I could imagine Gaston would really throw Lily over for. I wouldn't really question her performance as much as the casting itself.I can't really say that I detect any particularly interesting ideas in the film. That's really the only knock against it. The atmosphere that Lubtisch creates is glorious and the characters are interesting in and of themselves.

His films are sort of like combining a regular film with the photos of Ansel Adams and the sophistication and class of Cary Grant. Some wonderful examples would include IF I HAD A MILLION, THE MERRY WIDOW (so beautiful that I loved the film even though I usually dislike musicals), NINOTCHKA and THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER.This film has a very simple plot. Gentleman thief Herbert Marshall (in his very best screen role) falls for lady thief Miriam Hopkins in the wonderful opening scene. Then they travel throughout Europe stealing and living like royalty. Later, they meet up with Madamoiselle Colet (Kay Francis)--a rich woman who runs a huge cosmetics firm. They plan on fleecing her but in the process it seems as if Marshall and Francis are falling in love and Hopkins is hopping mad! The romance between Marshall and Francis is delightful and sweet, but ultimately he must choose between the two ladies.I don't want to reveal any more plot, as it might spoil the film.
