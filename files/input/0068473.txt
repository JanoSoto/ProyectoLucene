[{"Title":"One of the most disturbing films of all time","Date":"13 September 1999","Score":"240 out of 284 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  Unlike many other films, which are disturbing either by dint of their naked unpleasantness (Man Bites Dog) or their sheer violence (most Peckinpah films), Deliverance shocks by its plausibility. Certainly, the buggery scene is pretty straightforward in its unpleasantness, but the film's effect derives far more from its slow build-up and the tangible sense of isolation surrounding the four leads, both before and after everything starts to go wrong. The moment when the canoes pass under the child on the bridge, who does not even acknowledge the men he had earlier played music with, let alone show any sign of human affection towards them, is among the most sinister in modern film. The tension increases steadily throughout the canoe trip, and perseveres even after the final credits - the ending makes the significance of the characters' ordeals horrifically real. The movie's plausibility is greatly aided by the playing of the leads, particularly Ned Beatty and Jon Voight as the victim and reluctant hero respectively. Burt Reynolds, too, has never been better. The film's cultural influence is demonstrable by the number of people who will understand a reference to 'banjo territory' - perhaps only Get Carter has done such an effective hatchet-job on a region's tourist industry. I can think of only a handful of movies which put me into such a serious depression after they had finished - the oppressive atmosphere of Se7en is the best comparison I can think of. Although so much of it is excellent of itself, Deliverance is a classic above all because there are no adequate points of comparison with it - it is unique.

It is disheartening to read the number of negative reviews for this excellent film, which I can only attribute to the one-dimensional nature of today's uber-blockbusters.  It seems that the finer subtleties of good filmmaking present in Deliverance are lost on today's generation of moviegoers whose cinematic palates have been cloyed with multi-million-dollar special effects, unimaginative dialogue, mindless violence and saccharine plots. Every aspect of this movie has been wonderfully choreographed and combine to create a film that goes well beyond mere entertainment, simultaneously shocking and challenging the audience.Everything that occurs in this movie serves a poignant purpose; the creators focus on quality rather than quantity. The plot, which seems simple enough, gradually takes on an eerily disturbing nature. The dialogue is sparse, but screenwriters and director use it as a strength, allowing events and cinematography to speak volumes about the characters. The violence, though disturbing, also acts as an integral piece of the film. The scenery is spectacular and Deliverance makes some of the best use of foreshadowing and silence I've ever seen in a movie.Few movies leave such an impression on the viewer.  To this day, I can't hear Dueling Banjos--or just about any banjo music for that matter--without thinking of this movie. Nor can I help but feel this movie doomed Ned Beatty's acting career (after seeing this film, every time you see Ned Beatty in any other role, you can't help but remember the infamous riverbank scene). Even people who have never seen the movie know the ghastly meaning of the words squeal like a pig.It is truly worth taking the time to see this film. It is an excellent treatise of the human reaction when challenged with fear, danger and adventure.

The setting is backwoods Georgia, with its forests, mountains, and wild rivers.The director, John Boorman, chose to use local people, not actors, to portray secondary characters. These locals imbue the film with a depth of characterization unequaled in film history. No central casting actors could ever come close to these people's remarkable faces, voices, or actions. I don't recall a film wherein the secondary characters are so realistic and colorful. As much as anything else, it is this gritty realism that makes this film so amazing.Another strength is the film's theme. Nature, in the wild, can be violent. How appropriate that the setting should be the American South. Very few places in the U.S. are, or have been, as violent as redneck country. In a story about Darwinian survival of the fittest, the film conveys the idea that humans are part of nature, not separate from it.Deliverance is very much a product of its time when, unlike today, Americans expressed concern over a vanishing wilderness. The film's magnificent scenery, the sounds of birds, frogs, crickets, and the roar of the river rapids, combined with the absence of civilization, all convey an environmental message. And that is another strength of the film.At an entertainment level, the tension gradually escalates, as the plot proceeds. Not even half way into the film the tension becomes extreme, and then never lets up, not until the final credits roll. Very few films can sustain that level of intensity over such a long span of plot.Finally, the film's technical quality is topnotch. Direction and editing are flawless. Cinematography is excellent. Dialogue is interesting. And the acting is terrific. Burt Reynolds has never been better. Ned Beatty is perfectly cast and does a fine job. And Jon Voight should have been nominated for an Oscar. If there is a weak link in the film, it is the music, which strikes me as timid.Overall, Deliverance almost certainly will appeal to viewers who like outdoor adventure. Even for those who don't, the gritty characterizations, the acting, and the plot tension are reasons enough to watch this film, one of the finest in cinema history.

The film has aged well. Despite being made in the early Seventies, it certainly doesn't look particularly dated. It still possesses a visceral punch and iconic status as a dramatic post-'Death of the Sixties' philosophical-and-cultural shock vehicle. There are very few films with similar conceits that can compare favourably to it, although the legendary Sam Peckinpah's stuff would have to be up there. Yes, there has been considerable debate and discussion about the film's most confronting scene (which I won't expand upon here) - and undoubtedly one of the most confronting scenes in the entire history of the cinematic medium - but what surprises about this film is how achingly beautiful it is at times. This seems to be generally overlooked (yet in retrospect quite understandably so). The cinematography that captures the essence of the vanishing, fragile river wilderness is often absolutely stunning, and it counterbalances the film as, in a moment of brief madness, we the viewers - along with the characters themselves - are plunged into unrelenting nightmare. 'Deliverance's narrative is fittingly lean and sinewy, and it is surprising how quickly events unfold from point of establishment, through to crisis, and aftermath. It all takes place very quickly, which lends a sense of very real urgency to the film. The setting is established effectively through the opening credits. The characters are all well-drawn despite limited time spent on back story. We know just enough about them to know them for the kind of man they are, like them and ultimately fear for them when all goes to hell. The conflict and violence within the movie seems to erupt out of nowhere, with a frightening lack of logic. This is author James Dickey's theme - that any prevailing romanticism about the nature of Man's perceived inherent 'goodness' can only wilt and die when his barely suppressed animal instincts come to the fore. There are no demons or bogeymen here. The predatory hillbillies - as the film's central villains - are merely crude, terrifyingly amoral cousins of our protagonists. They shock because their evil is petty and tangible. The film has no peripheral characters. All reflect something about the weaknesses and uncertainties of urbanised Homo Sapiens in the latter 20th century, and all are very real and recognisable. Burt Reynolds is wonderful in this movie as the gung-ho and almost fatally over-confident Survivalist, Lewis, and it is a shame to think that he really couldn't recapture his brief moment of dramatic glory throughout the rest of his still sputtering up-and-down career ('Boogie Nights' excluded, perhaps). Trust me, if your are not a Reynolds fan, you WILL be impressed with his performance here. John Voight is his usual effortlessly accomplished self, and Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox both make significant contributions. This is simply a great quartet of actors. To conclude, I must speculate as to if and when 'Deliverance' author James Dickey's 'To the White Sea' will be made. For those that enjoyed (?) this film, TTWS is a similarly harrowing tale of an American Air Force pilot's struggle for survival after being shot down over the Japanese mainland during WW2. It's more of the typically bleak existentialism and primordial savagery that is Dickey's trademark, but it has all the makings of a truly spectacular, poetic cinematic experience. There was the suggestion a few years ago that the Coen brothers might be producing it, but that eventually came to nothing. Being an avid Coen-o-phile it disappoints me to think what might have been had they gotten the green light on TTWS, rather than their last couple of relatively undistinguished efforts. Returning to 'Deliverance', it's impossible to imagine a movie of such honest, unnerving brutality being made in these times, and that is pretty shameful. We, the cinema-going public, are all the poorer for this.

Maybe by today's blood and bullets standards it doesn't seem so edgy, but if you think that this was 1972 and that the movie has a truly sinister core then it makes you think differently.When I started watching this movie nothing really seemed unusual until I got to the Dueling Banjos scene. In that scene the brutality and edge of this film is truly visible. As I watched Drew(Ronny Cox,Robocop)go head to head with a seemingly retarted young boy it really shows how edgy this movies can get. When you think that the kid has a small banjo, which he could of probably made by hand, compared to Drew's nice expensive guitar, you really figure out just how out of their territory the four men are.As the plot goes it's very believable and never stretches past its limits. But what really distinguishes this film, about four business    men who get more than they bargained for on a canoe trip, is that director John Boorman(Excalibur) breaks all the characters away from plain caricatures or stereotypes. So as the movie goes into full horror and suspense I really cared about all four men and what would happen to them.The acting is universally excellent. With Jon Voight(Midnight Cowboy, Enemy of the State) and Burt Reynolds(Boogie Nights, Striptease) leading the great cast. Jon Voight does probably the hardest thing of all in this film and that is making his transformation from family man to warrior very believable. Unlike Reynolds whose character is a warrior from the start, Voight's character transforms over the course of the movie. Ned Beatty(Life) is also good in an extremely hard role, come on getting raped by a hillbilly, while Ronny Cox turns in a believable performance.One thing that really made this movies powerful for me is that the villains were as terrifying as any I had ever seen. Bill Mckinney and Herbert Cowboy Coward were excellent and extremely frightening as the hillbilly's.Overall Deliverance was excellent and I suggest it to anyone, except for people with weak stomachs and kids. 10/10.

The film still scares the sh*t out of me! I mean, what would YOU do if you were confronted by two hill-billies in a situation like that? It's so easy to remain distant and see the film as entertainment, but take a reality-check and immerse yourself in the story. It's a shame some just don't appreciate the film - guess we're used to adrenaline-pumping action from start to finish nowadays, but that's too easy - it doesn't require emotional involvement from the viewer unlike a film such as Deliverance...

Burt Reynolds, Jon Voight, Ned Beatty, and Ronny Cox portray four Atlanta businessmen who decide to take a canoe trip down the wild Cahulawassee River in northern Georgia before it is dammed up into what Reynolds calls one big, dead lake.But the local mountain folk take a painfully obvious dim view of these city boys carousing through their woods.  And the following day, continuing on down the river, Beatty and Voight are accosted and sexually assaulted (the film's infamous SQUEAL! sequence) by two vicious mountain men (Bill McKinney, Herbert Cowboy Coward).  Thus, what started out as nothing more than a lark through the Appalachians has now turned into a nightmare in which our four protagonists come to see the thin line that exists between what we think of as civilization and what we think of as barbarism.James Dickey adapted the screenplay from his own best-selling book, and the result is an often gripping and disturbing shocker.  Often known for its SQUEAL! and Dueling Banjos sequences, DELIVERANCE is also quite a pulse-pounding ordeal, with the four leading men superb in their roles, and McKinney and Coward making for two of the most frightening villains of all times.  A must-see film for those willing to take a chance.

It's about four businessmen, driven by manhood and macho-behavior, who're spending a canoeing weekend high up in the mountains. Up there, they're faced with every darkest side of man and every worst form of human misery...poverty, buggery and even physical harassment! These four men intended to travel down the river for adventure and excitement but their trip soon changes into an odyssey through a violent and lurking mountain-land, completely estranged from all forms of civilisation. All these elements actually make Deliverance one of the most nightmarish films I've ever seen. Just about everything that happens to these men, you pray that you'll never find yourself to be in a similar situation. Pure talking cinema, Deliverance is a very important movie as well. John Boorman's best (closely followed by Zardoz and Excalibur) was - and still is - a very influential film and it contains several memorable scenes that already featured in numberless other movies.

This, in itself, was testimony that Deliverance was a spell-binding movie.  I think Boorman did a wonderful job on directing this film.  How expertly the early scene with the hill folk and the dueling banjos was done.  It showed so well and early on how inherently reserved and simple the people of the area were.  Case in point - near the end of the duel, the banjo-playing boy was smiling (loved his banjo), but when Drew tried to shake the boy's hand after the duel, the kid was too reserved to respond.  The river trip never left you bored, for sure.  The rape scene was brutal, but necessary to show just what the group was up against in this backwoods area of Georgia.  I think Beatty's traumatic shock afterward was well done.  Some have said he was pretty unaffected by the ordeal.  I disagree - if you really payed attention, he was unresponsive during the entire action immediately following, in which Reynolds put the arrow through the attacker and they chased off the toothless guy.  It was confusing when Ed killed the other guy later, at the top of the cliff.  It almost appeared that the arrow was shot while Ed was curled up and expecting to die, but then you realize the arrow he had shot earlier had finally taken effect.Anyway, a great movie, and I was wavering between an 8 and 9 on my vote, but after reading a message from a disgruntled voter who gave it a 1, I gave it a 10.  This individual's reasoning seemed based on personal bias, rather than an objective viewpoint, and his vote was obviously a non-correlating attempt to lower the rating.

Then two hillbillies attack Ed and Bobby. One of them rapes Bobby...and the trip becomes a nightmare.Just unbelievable. The scenery is incredibly beautiful yet this horrific violence is taking place. To be truthful, Beatty's rape has never bothered me--I'm very aware it's being faked despite the good acting. This movie also shows how the characters change--Ed has his pacifism tested, Lewis becomes weak, Bobby is violated by one of the people he mocked earlier on and Drew tries to keep himself sane. Direction by John Boorman is also very assured and the sounds of the forest and the river help the mood immensely.The acting is mostly good. Voight is just OK in the lead--he's been better. Beatty is also just OK--but it is his debut film and he has guts for taking such a risky role. Cox is very good especially when things start falling apart. And Reynolds is just superb--one of his best acting jobs EVER! How this wasn't even nominated for an Academy Award escapes me. Also Bill McKinney and Herbert Coward are way too believable as the hillbillies.A powerful film--NOT for children. Try to see an uncut version--the TV version is butchered.

Deliverance is one of the most powerful movies I've seen, haunting me with its nightmarish imagery and forcing me to ask myself the question How far would I go in a similar situation? And what effect would it have on me? A rarity for a film, it does not soften the blow of the original story, its meaning nor the questions it raises for the viewer. People complain about violence in movies but that vast majority of violence is nothing more than glorified cartoonish fiction, a testosterone release for boys of all ages. It's false and one dimensionally clichéd, usually written by arm chair warriors who get their notions of violence from tall tales others have told them, usually in the form of more bad fictional violence they have seen in other movies, comic books, etc. For anyone who has experienced it or honestly evaluated it, real, brutal violence is not fun nor a cause for celebration for those that survive or win. The swaggering, good guy hero may be fun to watch in the western movie, and I enjoy a good vicarious release film as much as the next guy, but these heroes don't really exist, certainly not as the brash, righteous hero they're colored as. Real, brutal violence is just that, real and brutal. There aren't any winners or heroes when it comes to savagery and killing, just survivors who are profoundly impacted, irrevocably changed in a harsh and painful way. If you're unsure of this fact, just ask anyone who really has experienced it, not the teller of tall tales as most are but the veteran who lives next door but came back strangely changed and won't discuss the nightmares he's living. Survivors of real, savage violence don't brag about it in bars and wear it as a badge of courage. They seldom or never discuss it, so unfortunately the naive think the liars who spin tales of false bravado are real. We need real violence in movies, the impact it has on the soul of a person. For once I'd like to see when someone gets hit on the head in the film hard enough to be knocked out that almost a third of them will die from their injuries and the remaining survivors will not jump up, perfectly fine when it's advantageous to the story but come to and pass out repeatedly, experiencing searing headaches unlike anything you can imagine, vomiting and unable to stand for hours sometimes days due to their severe cranial concussion. If there were more movies like Deliverence that deliver a real story, powerfully and unapologetically, violence in movies would become a powerful tool for education, very probably reducing its frequency by those who shockingly discover being involved is nothing to be proud or righteous about, a lesson learned way too late by so many walking wounded, often living right next to to you.As a side note, I was told by a literary friend that James Dickey wrote this over the course of a manic weekend on a bet. He was a poet who at a cocktail party on a Friday argued with an acquaintance that writing fiction was much easier than poetry. He set out to prove it and the novel Deliverance was the result. Certainly, the novel follows the weekend time line exactly. Great story, but I have yet to be able to authenticate it.

But the perils of nature are not the only dangerous things in their midst, unfriendly wood folk are about to bring another dimension in terror.Deliverance is one of those film's that sometimes suffers by way of reputation. Much like Straw Dogs and 70s film's of that type, the hype and promise of unremitting hell often isn't delivered to an expectant modern audience. Which is a shame since Deliverance is one of the finest, glummest, brutalistic and beautiful film's of the 1970s.Adapting from James Dickey's novel (screenplay duties here also), British director John Boorman crafts a tough and powerful film of men out of their environment, thus out of their league. As each man sets off initially, it's a test of manhood, but each guy is forced to deconstruct their worth, and it soon becomes more about survival as this deadly adventure proceeds. Boorman, aided by cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond, has painted a raw and treacherous landscape, unconquered by city slickers but dwelt in by inbreds who don't take kindly to the city folk showing up with their machismo attitudes. From the first point of contact with the strange locals, where Drew goes duelling banjos with an odd looking child, the film doesn't let up, much like the locals themselves, the film also is remorseless. Some critics over the years have proclaimed that Deliverance is too pretty, mistaking lush physicality as something detracting from the dark thematics at work. Not so-the Chattooga River sequences are electrifying, the rapids scenes (brilliantly filmed with Voight and Reynolds doing real work, and getting real injuries) are merely setting up the unmanning of our macho guys just around the corner. It's a fabulous and potent piece of beauty. With the four cast leaders absolutely brilliant in their respective roles. In fact there are few better casting decisions ever than that of Reynolds as Lewis, one can only lament that he didn't have more hard edged serious roles in his career.Minor itches exist, metaphors are heavy (Vietnam a 70s staple it seems) while ecological concerns are hinted at without being as prominent as they are in the novel. Surveying the landscape during the opening of the piece, Lewis reflects that man is going to rape this land, rape it, it's stuff like that that is not totally formed, given way to abject horror and survival-Lewis again noting that survival is the name of the game. A game of life and death where man's primal being means violence may indeed beget violence.

The acting is absolutely stellar -- the chemistry between Jon Voight, Burt Reynolds, Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox is incredible as four guys from wildly differing backgrounds, united by a common thread of humanity. The four city-slickers head out together for a white water canoe trip down a river in the hill country of northern Georgia. The film is packed to the brim with action, adventure, and the essence of survival. Adding to the intensity is that fact that almost all of the movie was shot on location, at an almost inaccessible river deep in the south. Director John Boorman had to use jeeps to truck in the equipment and the 4 lead actors were actually transported by canoe! Voight also performs a rock climbing feat that will leave you in awe (according to the making of documentary on the DVD, Voight declined to use a stuntman). The white-water cinematography and choreography is breathtaking, especially considering that this was shot in the early 1970s.At first, from a quick glance, Deliverance appears to be a straightforward adventure story; however, the film goes down a deeply philosophical route as the four men race their vehicles into the back-country and then their canoes down the wilds of the river. The film explores our relationship with nature, conceptualization of morality, and the existentialism inherent in life. The backwoods hillbillies the four adventurers interact with in various ways paint an amazingly complex portrait which ties together the destruction of nature, man's evolution from his natural roots to the resigned life of city dweller, and the tensions and prejudice inherent in humanity. This is done perfectly, without drawing on stereotypical black vs. white or yankee vs. southerner comparisons--all the characters in this film are southerners, although each character (major and minor), for all intensive purposes, transcends categorization.The Dueling Banjo scene, in which guitar-slinging Ronny Cox battles a banjo-playing hillbilly kid (the actor, Billy Redden, was actually a resident of the backwoods region where this was shot) sharply complements the men's fight against the river, and the river's fight to remain wild. This film simultaneously explores the theme of duality from the confines of (1) the individual's mind, (2) Reynolds' group of comrades, (3) all humanity as a whole, and (4) something much greater. The banjo music in this scene is awesome!!! If you enjoy the song Dueling Banjos, I strongly suggest that you pick up the Deliverance soundtrack, which also includes 17 additional songs played by amazing banjo musician Eric Weissberg (I believe only Deuling Banjos and maybe one or two other songs were actually used in the film).There are some disturbing scenes in this film, so it is not for the overly squeamish but, if you think you can handle the river, I encourage you to take this powerful, action-packed journey into the philosophical backwater of humanity!

So when he appears in the adaptation of his own book as a sheriff, it isn't like some tiny, unintimidating author playing a part for a laugh.Deliverance is as deadly serious a 70s hit as anything before or since. The fear factor, before that term invoked images of silly people eating insects on primetime TV, rises like the violent waters about to break a levee once and for all. The great John Boorman directed this. And to a large extent, Dickey was an unofficial (and unwanted) assistant to Boorman. Or rather, a competitor. I can only imagine how an author reacts to anyone taking their creation from the page to the screen and all the struggles involved with that. Apparently, Dickey would address the four main actors by their character's name. Burt Reynolds says in his autobiography that he finally told Dickey off and the big man replied, That's exactly what Lewis would say! And later on during the shoot, before departing, he also said, I understand my presence would be more efficacious in it's absence! The four men on this trip into the horrors of confronting dangers both in Mother Nature's and deranged human assailant form find out what real fear is all about. Life in the city didn't prepare most of them for the moment when they'd have to fight for their very lives.Ned Beatty was probably the most visible of the rape survivors in film history, at least in North America (Sophia Loren in Two Women would be the international candidate for that, I guess). Certainly as a man attacked by another man, he tapped into an energy most males didn't want to acknowledge. But females watching him struggle know what that distress is really all about. Domination and a perverse, insidious display of power corruption in the human soul and society at large are the key components of sexual assaults.Until Jodie Foster starred in The Accused, Beatty stood almost alone in representing a person violated who found the courage to go on despite the trauma the attack unleashed. How many major stars would play this part, then or now, without wanting to compromise at least a little bit in the extent of the scene? Reynolds also said that during it's filming, the action went on to the point where he couldn't take it anymore and tackled Billy McKinney off Beatty and demanded of the director, Why the hell did you let that go on so long? To which Boorman replied, Because I knew when you reached your breaking point, that's when the audience would reach their's!

'Deliverance' is a tale about four well-to-do Atlanta business men who decide to go on a weekend long canoe trip. All four men are friends with very different personalities. There's Lewis Medlock (Burt Reynolds) the survivalist and the authoritative leader of the group. Ed Gentry (Jon Voight) is the easy going family man. Bobby Tripp (Ned Beatty) is the sarcastic pampered insurance salesman. Drew Bollinger (Ronny Cox) is the banjo playing voice of reason and moral compass of the bunch.The foursome decide to do their extended trip in a very remote part of rural Georgia. This will be the group's only time ever to enjoy the Cahulawassee River. Soon, a local power company will complete a dam for a power generator. It's only a matter of time before the river is gone and the forgotten community of Antry will be replaced by a lake. The town and it's residence will be re-located to higher ground.The inhabitance of the rolling hills of the Cahulawassee are poor rural folk who've never seen civilization. They are highly mistrustful of outsiders and just as soon keep to themselves. These people are poverty stricken, have little to no education and many are the products of inbreeding. Truly, the people that time forgot.There are subtle signs at the beginning of the expedition that the four river travelers may have been better off staying in Atlanta and playing golf. Nevertheless, they press on to their fateful trip. It starts off fun and adventurous enough. - Then the unthinkable happens. It's one of the most disturbing encounters in modern movies. After that, all bets are off . . .'Deliverance' is skillfully directed by John Boorman. He creates wonderful characters, creates a sense of awe, tension and dread. This is a taunt drama about the worst camping nightmare come to life and how to deal with it. Boorman would later go on to direct 'Excalibur' (1981) and 'The Emerald Forest' (1985).Deliverance is a great sociological commentary on cultural values and differences. It works on a very subtle level with many things to think about. By today's standards, the pacing of Deliverance may be too slow for some people. I recommend it, but not to those who have the attention span of a flea.

Lewis, Ed, Bobby and Drew (macho, pensive, amiable and humanitarian) are attacked by two back woods red necks. Cue the unforgettable - `You look just like a little hog. Squeal piggy!' line.

I thought it terrific when I first saw it, but had I missed something even so?  Was it more than just a disturbing adventure movie, in which city people run afoul of backwoodsmen?      So as soon as I saw the DVD, I bought it, even though it was obviously another Warner Bros. rush-it-out, never-mind-the-extras job.       The movie isn't as good as I remembered -- it's better.  Those who are looking for a RIVER WILD thriller, or a SOUTHERN COMFORT (a DELIVERANCE imitation) suspense movie, are already looking in the wrong place.  This movie is about what goes on inside people much more than it is about what goes on >around< them.     I've seen comments here suggesting that Ned Beatty doesn't show enough reaction after being brutally raped.  Huh?  He's stunned for ten minutes, then tries to attack Bill McKinney's >corpse<.  He's still rattled the last time we see him in the movie, when he tells Jon Voight that they won't be seeing each other for a while.  (Which clearly means forever.)  Beatty's life has been changed; he'll never get over it.     So has Voight's, but in a different way.  For the first time, I noticed that >three< people get into the tow truck when Reynolds hires those brothers to drive their cars to the canoeist's destination.  Sure, that's logical -- there are three vehicles to drive initially, after all.  But why does Boorman take pains to avoid showing us the face of the third person in the tow truck, but does show him fingering the gun in the rear window of the truck?       Could it be because this guy turns up later?  Is he Bill McKinney's character?  Or the Toothless guy?  Or the guy Voight kills?  Which of course raises the most important questions in the movie WAS Ronny Cox shot?  And if he was, was the guy Voight kills the one who shot him?  (And was Voight's victim the Toothless guy?)  On an initial viewing of the movie, all this seems pretty obvious yes, Cox is shot; yes, Voight kills the right person, the Toothless guy.       But then what about the man we later learn has gone hunting but who hasn't returned?  Why is Voight so shocked when he looks into the mouth of his victim?  Boorman and Dickey give great weight to the scene in which Voight fails to kill a deer.  (Even if he had, it would have been a foolish, wasteful act.)  The interplay between Voight and Reynolds is also very interesting; Voight clearly admires Reynolds on some levels, while finding him disgusting on others.        Dickey is primarily a poet, secondarily a novelist; it's not hard to believe that he intended all four men to represent different aspects of the human condition.  DELIVERANCE is one of the most intricately ambiguous movies of its type ever made; it cannot be pulled apart into easily-understood sections, and where our sympathies should lie is never obvious.  Even the sheriff, played by Dickey himself, has darker shadings that are partly inexplicable.  And there is that shot of the removal of the graves; it's not in there by chance or for local color.     On the surface, DELIVERANCE seems to be an exciting, disturbing adventure -- and it is that.  But just like the secrets the lake conceals, there's a great deal more beneath the surface of DELIVERANCE.

There are some film critics like Ebert that when they are made uncomfortable by a movie, dismiss it without examining it, and call it sensationalistic. Mr. Ebert has done this with this one, which means this movie has done its job. The critic is too uncomfortable to examine the emotions this movie evokes, and uses pseudo-intellectualism to insulate himself from it. (Particularly in his hackneyed statement that the writer of the book made up contrived statements in the movie, instead of being real ones.) POSSIBLE SPOILERS The premise is simple; four businessmen leave the safety of their urban environment to go water rafting; they encounter a world outside their safe haven, that they cannot control. They eventually run into the wrong people, who despise them for simply existing and invading their territory, and their journey becomes a nightmare. The movie is a study in how alienated man can become from his own species, how superficial the trappings of civilization are, and how civilized behavior will not help you survive when encountering simple animalistic behavior. The moral of the movie seems to be, there is no morality in survival, there is only survival. The men are graphically tortured, one raped, one murdered apparently by a hillbilly sniper trying to cover their tracks, and forced to commit murder to simply survive. Or is it simple self defense? They then realize that if they are honest and report the attacks that were made on them, they will be tried and executed simply for defending themselves. They are therefore forced to lie, cover up and hide their experiences for life, even from their own families if they are to survive in the artificial civilized world they return to. The movie places the characters in unfair circumstances they must survive in, and then further unfair circumstances as they must hide what happened to them to escape a place that will execute them if they tell the truth about defending themselves. The unspoken message stay in your own backyard or you'll be killed is very depressing. But then, there are residents in Los Angeles that cannot even go into a different neighborhood without gangs targeting and killing them for no reason. When a critic like Roger Ebert is too afraid to really examine the dark statements this movie makes emotionally, you know you have a movie that will move you and disturb you. The ironic thing is that now we have movies like Chain Saw Massacre III, Devil's Rejects, Friday the13th 1-9, etc, that make this movie's violence seem mild. However, the hatred, alienation and cruelty it examines will haunt and disturb you for years afterwards, long after meaningless drivel like the other movies mentioned are forgotten. In this day and age, that is no small accomplishment. Eight stars for me. (cue banjo music....) "},{"Title":"City Boys Have Difficulty Adjusting to Country Living","Date":"8 February 2004","Score":"8 out of 11 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Thriller","Review":" SPOILERS.There are a couple of great things about this movie -- and it IS very good indeed.One is that James Dickey (who does very nicely with the role of sheriff) has structured the plot in three acts. Ordinarily, plots involve a series of minor crises leading up to an explosive climax. In other words, there's a big shootout or explosion at the very end. Sometimes there's enough time left for a final word or two. Come back, Shane! Or, He used to be a big shot. Or, Mother of Mercy, is this the end of Rico? Dickey's approach leads to a different kind of climax, an emotional one. The violence occurs at the end of act two. Here's what I mean. Act One The characters get to know one another and we get to know them, and to care about them. Each of the four reflects some part of what all of us are or would like to be. We thrill along with them as they negotiate the river. Act Two Brutal sodomy, rapids, compound fractures, and three murders. These aren't Dirty-Harry style murders either -- Bang, and the bad guy disappears. Each death is filled with meaning. Act Three The investigation, which turns out to be as emotionally charged as anything that has gone before, although some twelve-year-olds might get bored now that the blood has already been spilled. It's the kind of structure that appeals to grownups. Perhaps the most engaging moment in the film is when Voight sits down at the dinner table in the boarding house and momentarily breaks into a sob. The other guests look away and pay him what sociologists call civil inattention, until Beatty breaks the silence with, Mmm. This corn is somethin' special, isn't it? Those one or two moments when Voight covers his face with his hands is the catharsis that he (and the audience) so desperately need.It's also Burt Reynold's best part. He puts a lot into the role of Lewis, the instinctive man, who wants to be a part of nature and finds that that means he's vulnerable. It isn't that he hasn't played other roles with some intensity, as in Sharkey's Machine, but the stories were unworthy of the effort. Everyone else is equally good. Voight is the affable man of reason, Cox the talented moralist, Beatty the thin-skinned butt of jokes, so to speak. And the two heavies! Has Bill McKinney ever been more slimy? And Cowboy Coward, an inarticulate goon with a mouthful of procumbent false teeth. I can't pass up Kathy Rickman as the angelic nurse who is strikingly beautiful and has only one line, You going' to sleep?The score is finely done too, mostly a duet for banjo and guitar, which was turned into a pop hit. But it's more than just a catchy bluegrass tune. The banjo is hardly an elegant instrument, but what mournful notes are called from it when Voight and Beatty slowly paddle their canoe towards safety. Boorman and his photographer deserve lots of the credit for the movie's success. I don't know Dickey's poetry but I've read his novel. (The poor guy kept showing up drunk on the set.) The book is full of striking imagery and Boorman has managed to capture most of it without being any flashier than the novel was. Boorman interrupts the story at one point to let his camera linger on a shot of the sky. We see the hazy sun, and some puffy, rather unpleasant-looking clouds slowly sliding towards it, and when the edge of the cloud meets the solar disc, the slight scattering of the sunlight produces a wide concentric circle of pink, not pretty, more like an inflamed sore. I suppose the film could be analyzed so that it would be understood as a bundle of oppositions, culture vs. nature. Neither of them is particularly benificent. Culture is going to destroy the river. But the mountain men are naturals too, and worthy of destruction. The town that will be buried under the lake is a pile of junk. But that sort of thing isn't necessary here because the story itself is so gripping. It's not a movie you're likely to forget.

Though it is not a horror movie, it is just as terrifying as any classic horror film. The very thought of being a normal red-blooded male enjoying an adventure weekend miles from any form of civilisation, only to be captured and sodomised by a couple of violent hillbillies, is surely the worst nightmare of 99.9% of the world's population. It would have been easy for Deliverance to slip into exploitation territory, but John Boorman has cleverly avoided the temptation to go down such a route and has made a film that explores, questions and challenges the very meaning of masculinity. With so many films, you come away wishing to heaven that you could step into the hero's shoes, performing heroic deeds and saving the day and getting the girl.... but with Deliverance, you come away praying to God that you'll never have to experience what these four protagonists go through.Four city guys - Ed (Jon Voight), Lewis (Burt Reynolds), Drew (Ronny Cox) and Bobby (Ned Beatty) - head out into the wilderness to spend a few days canoing down a soon-to-be-dammed river. The guys are riding the rapids in pairs, and Ed and Bobby inadvertently get a little too far ahead of the others so they pull in to the riverside and await their pals in the adjacent woodland. Here, they fall foul of two local woodlanders (Bill McKinney and Herbert Coward), who tie Ed to a tree, while one of them strips and rapes Bobby instructing him, perversely, to squeal like a pig. Lewis and Drew arrive unseen and Lewis, being a fair archer, kills the rapist while the other hillbilly beats a hasty retreat into the forest. Under great emotional stress, the four canoeists decide to conceal the event and get out of the area. But they find the river increasingly dangerous to negotiate as they journey downstream, and the risk to their lives heightens when the surviving hillbilly returns to take shots at them with his rifle from some unseen vantage point in the rocky cliffs beside the river.Deliverance is very powerful as a survival tale, but even more powerful (and disturbing) as a study of macho attitudes being torn apart and left in humiliated tatters. Though all the performances are remarkable, one must take particular note of Beatty's efforts in a role that many actors would've turned down. The film is very similar thematically to the 1971 film Straw Dogs - both films deal with terrifying sexual violence in isolated locales, and in both the eventual violent revenge exacted by the victim does not result in any sense of satisfaction. The backdrop of the rugged countryside in Deliverance is beautiful to look at, but it also adds to the tension by placing the four canoeists in a setting where they are at the mercy of the hillbillies and the landscape, with nobody to rely on other than themselves. This truly is suspenseful film-making at its finest. "},{"Title":"oppressively chilling to watch and very thought provoking","Date":"13 December 2014","Score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Thriller","Review":" SPOILERS! My review is mostly meant for examination by those who have already seen the movie!As others have said this is a truly chilling and sinister film, many so called scary films lose their edge over the years by becoming dated, but this film feels sinister from the beginning and becomes almost unbearably oppressive to watch. Probably what makes it so chilling is the terrible events are entirely plausible.One reviewer here said that this film was about how violence (real violence) affects people, I won't repeat his review because he explains it more eloquently than I, but I totally agree.But interestingly enough as a woman it seemed to me that this movie was also examining masculinity but none of the male reviewers here have mentioned that, so I may be wrong. But I feel this way because it is noticeable to me how differently the men react, compared to women, to trauma. After the male rape not only is it never mentioned again but even initially when Ned is rescued it is not mentioned. I feel women would at least have a cry and hug each other first, but I may be wrong, because shock can manifest in different ways. However all of the men react in the same seemingly unemotional way, of course it is obvious that the men are traumatised by the event but their reaction is to protect their friend and fix the problem. And their way of fixing the problem is by not talking about it. Of course, part of the reason this event can't be discussed is because it is so emasculating. But their caring is obvious in little vignettes, for instance when Jon Voight helps Ned dress after the rape. Why men suppress emotions is something I have not always understood and at times has annoyed me, but this movie was such an insight for me, as I finally got it. We women know how to let out emotion safely, but men are so trained to suppress it that when it does happen it is often like a dam bursting then they can't control it, so it's safer to bottle it up.But the sad thing is though that their suppression will have terrible effects on them, this is one of the reasons therapists often say people shouldn't bury their problem (never was a metaphor so apt as in this film), however letting it out will make them crack, so they can't win, if they talk about it or suppress it, either way it will affect their sanity.Mind you even as a woman I could understand that many women would want to bottle up an event as traumatic as this one.Depressingly enough most movies when women get raped there is often something still sexy about the way it is shot but the male rape scene here is so sudden and so chilling you feel their helplessness and you know that if they aren't rescued that they will be killed and horribly, and you know they know this. Often rape reports deal with the violation but this scene really brings home to you the thought of not just the violation but the sheer terror that victims must feel, so I think this scene would be equally illustrative of what both men and women would experience.Even before the rape, it is obvious to me that all these men feel inadequate as men. Macho Lewis is over compensating, whiny Ned boasts about sexual conquests because he knows how unmanly he seems.So they want adventure (ie violence) so to transform themselves into real men, but ironically they don't understand that real violence isn't an adventure. Weirdly enough what should be considered emasculating, the horrible rape Ned experiences, is actually what transforms him into a real man, one who is scared but determined to survive and help his friends.Lewis almost does the opposite he goes from being the strong survivalist (though who undoubtedly saves them) to being terrified and in visible distress from his injury and helplessness.But I don't think the movie is saying that he is a coward. I think the movie shows them all as true human beings, they all show great courage at times but are also reduced to absolute terror at other times as anyone experiencing such horrors would. But that's part of the point is that you can not have true courage without real fear.So unlike the comic book heroes that they wanted to emulate, true heroism evolves from enduring terrible trauma.And it makes me wonder if perhaps one of the reasons that war veterans do not speak of war isn't just because of the horrors they saw but perhaps they are also ashamed of the times that they showed fear, no matter how courageous they may have been, deep down they may feel like cowards.The sad thing is that I think that the characters here will be forever traumatised and feel emasculated by what happened to them but the events were also the making of them as courageous heroes but they probably won't see it that way, but I had no doubt that Ned would go away being stronger, kinder and less brash to others and that Lewis would become more humble and that Jon Voight would appreciate his family more.This is one of the few movies I've seen adult male rape in, and society rarely mentions it too. I think issues such as this should be explored more in cinema, so that men who have experienced such terrible trauma can at least feel that the issue is being addressed in some way. Because let's face it part of the reason why Ned and the other characters can't speak about the rape is because society has deemed adult male rape to be an unspeakably shameful subject.

It's about man versus nature. It's about survival. It's about self-preservation. It's about how we deal with traumatic events. But, yeah, it's also about a man getting ass-raped by a grinning redneck with a pig fetish&#133; All too often people see nature as something beautiful, something charming and wonderful. But what they overlook is the brutality and the unforgiving selfishness that comes with survival. In such an environment no concessions are made and weakness is cruelly exploited, and so it is with the characters in Deliverance.Out of the four protagonists, Lewis is the one who is best equipped to deal with the river. He knows he's playing a game and he knows the rules. Yet he's also the cause of his friend's later misery; it's his romantic worship of nature and his arrogance that gets them into trouble, because although he respects the river and although he understands it to some degree, by challenging it he exposes his less-equipped friends to nature's cruelty. He may be testing himself, but he's testing his friends as well.The three other characters, to varying degrees, are less capable than Lewis. But in true Darwinian fashion it's the weakest character, Drew, who succumbs. He's the most moral and the most humane, which in a game of pure survival renders him the most susceptible. He's just not up to the task. But although he's killed, it's never entirely clear how he dies. His death, like much of the film, is clouded in ambiguity. Lewis is sure that Drew is killed by gunshot, but you never hear gunfire and Ed fails to find a clear bullet wound. Did he get shot? Did he faint and fall out of the canoe? Or did he die of a heart attack while under the immense stress that the characters are put under? You never know.And you're never sure if the man that Ed kills is indeed the toothless man. It certainly seems that way, as the man is indeed missing his front teeth, but you never get a clear look at him and the characters themselves aren't entirely sure. In a way it shows the hollowness of revenge, the way that it fails to satisfy and end our suffering, but it also shows our humanity. Unlike animals we're open doubt and we're open to regret, and unlike animals we have to live with our actions. It's what makes us human. Ed certainly won't forget what he did. It will always be with him, promising to rise to the surface at any moment.There's an excellent scene that illustrates Ed's pain. After surviving the river, he has to go back to something resembling a normal life and he has to eat dinner surrounded by the people who are looking after him. He breaks down. Now the reaction that follows may seem cruel &#150; everyone looks at him, and after an awkward silence, begin talking and joking &#150; but it's what he needs. It's what he needs to survive. And if anything, the scene shows that perhaps Bobby, the man who was raped by the rednecks, is better equipped at surviving than Ed. He stays strong.But I guess, in a way, you could say that the characters deserve what happens to them. At the beginning they treat the locals with a complete lack of respect. They treat them as sub-human &#150; apart from Drew who is the one person who tries to relate to them. Therefore what happens could be perceived as a final piece of revenge against the people that are destroying the wilderness and people's homes (the town is being flooded to make way for a dam). It's a last hurrah. It's the (very) common man's final blow against corporate America.In fact, watching the film back, it's interesting to note the way that the film hints that the city boys may have been hunted right from beginning. There's the lingering shot of the men in the woods when the businessmen first take to their canoes. There's the banjo player on the bridge &#150; perhaps he marks the point of no return. And there's the way that Lewis hears noises in the night when they're camping. Are they really the prey all along? Is their encounter with the mountain men more than chance? Of course, everything is pure speculation, but it's certainly open for debate.And the rape scene, of course, is brutal and shocking, but what makes it so disturbing is the interplay between the two hillbillies. It's as if they're flirting. It's as if it's some perverted love scene between the pair of them. The lingering looks they give one another and the chuckles of satisfaction certainly indicate this. They're probably doing what they'd like to do to each other only they're afraid to. After all, consensual sex between two men makes you gay. Rape, however, is an act of power and dominance. What could be more masculine than that? Of course, I'm being facetious, but the men here aren't really men. They're the animals that lurk in the darkness. They have no compassion and no humanity. Therefore, unlike the other locals they encounter, I feel they completely deserve the sub-human treatment they receive from the city boys. And I also agree with Lewis and his belief that their subsequent fight for survival is a game. That's exactly what it is, and the only thing that matters is that you play it and win. Everything else is secondary, even emotional well-being, because if you lose, even the least satisfying human emotions are denied to you.

This is not a Hollywood film. There are virtually no special effects whatsoever, the setting is extremely realistic, and nothing at all is sugarcoated or made pretty. The city boys look like city boys, and even the tough guy Louis, portrayed with precision by Burt Reynolds, is clearly at the mercy of the wild on this trip. This is a perfect example of a what-if film. What if a few friends went river rafting in an area of the woods that none of them were familiar with, and ended up desperately trying to avoid being tried and convicted for murders that they were forced to commit to save their own lives?There is clearly a very strong element of the film that deals with societal and class structure and the relationship (or lack thereof) between rural and urban peoples. When the four guys arrive in the woods early in the film, they clearly do not quite know how to interact with the people who live out there, and they speak to them as though they are unsure whether they will understand or be able to communicate. This communication block is most memorably illustrated in the dueling banjoes scene, in which they are trying to gas up the car and truck and get someone to drive the vehicles downriver for them. While Drew and the obviously inbred and probably mentally deficient boy on the porch are dueling with their guitar and banjo (one of the best scenes in the film), Louis is having some difficulty buying the gas, and Bobby makes a comment about genetic deficiencies and how pathetic it all is. When the boy turns away from Drew, who had offered to shake his hand after their stupendous jam session, Bobby tells him to give the kid a couple bucks, knowing that none of them are quite sure how to react.This is the kind of thing that we see in Deliverance that sets up so much of the tension that is to follow. This great scene where a lot of fun was had (including the funniest 'redneck dancing' scene until O Brother, Where Art Thou?) ended with everyone awkwardly unsure what to do around each other. These people are apples and oranges, and they live by completely different rules of life. The people that Louis, Bobby, Drew and Ed encounter in the hills grew up separated from modern society and modern laws, and live by the rules of nature, which do not include thou shalt not kill. Confused by their awkward behavior, the four friends set out on the river, hoping for the weirdness to end and for the adventure to begin.(spoilers) When they are briefly separated from each other and Ed and Bobby run into the hillbillies beside the river who quickly turn unpleasant, the uncertainty about the way that these people live - which was established by the scene above - comes into play to create the most tension during the scene. I think that a good sign of a quality thriller like this is that the tragic element of the film, namely the assaults and actual murders, takes up a very small amount of screen time but remain some of the most memorable parts of the film. There is no gratuitous violence here, it's all there for an obvious purpose and it achieves a startlingly powerful effect.The move is about the violent clash of two very different kinds of people, and what can happen when they inadvertently find themselves at war with each other. The trip down the rest of the river after the assault, which takes up the majority of the film, delivers some spectacularly effective tension, and keeps you on the edge of your seat while not bombarding you with so much happening that you become numb. It is surprisingly effective when we find out that Ed may very well have killed the wrong man up there on the cliff, and the tension in the film doesn't even let up when the three surviving members of the team reach the bottom of the river, because they deliver a questionable explanation to the police about what happened up there on the river and why the deputy's brother-in-law is missing.This is a very disturbing film, which is a testament to its success, because it's pretty obvious that a film like this is meant to shake people up a little bit. The hillbillies are the human (i.e. more realistic) version of the sub-human rednecks seen in childish but fairly similar films like Gator Bait and Gator Bait 2, neither of which could possibly ever be compared to a timeless film like Deliverance. When we follow these four men through their fateful weekend in the woods, the natural element is so real and we get to know the men so well and in such a subtle fashion that it's almost like we, as individuals of the audience, are really a fifth member of the team. It's not often that a film is able to come across that way.

Intent on seeing the Cahulawassee River before it's turned into one huge lake, outdoor fanatic Lewis Medlock (Burt Reynolds) takes his friends (John Voight , Ned Beatty , Ronny Cox) on a river-rafting trip they'll never forget into the risked American back-country filled with rare and violent hillbillies .This interesting picture contains intrigue , action , violence , marvelous landscapes and a strong ecological denounce. This trilling film was based on an exciting novel by James Dickey . At the time this motion picture was rated ¨R¨ for its excessive violence , sex and profanity ; nowadays this dangerous standard is underrated . To minimize costs, the production wasn't insured - and the actors did their own stunts , for instance, Jon Voight actually climbed the cliff and to save costs and add to the realism, local residents were cast in the roles of the hill people. Very good cast as John Boorman discovered both Ronny Cox and Ned Beatty working in theater , neither had substantial film experience previously. The notorious rape scene was filmed in one take, largely at the insistence of Ned Beatty who didn't want to film the scene repeatedly . Billy Redden plays the role of The Banjo Boy , he was hand-picked from his local elementary school, largely due to his look , his large head, skinny body, odd-shaped eyes and moronic grin , he was discovered by director Tim Burton in 2003 working as a dishwasher . Top-notch acting from John Voight and Burt Reynolds . Author James Dickey gave Burt Reynolds a few days of bow and arrow lessons and by the end, Reynolds was quite accurate and proficient with the weapon . Both Charlton Heston and Henry Fonda turned down the role of Lewis before it was offered to Burt Reynolds, who took it ; also Donald Sutherland turned down a role in this film because he objected to the violence in the script , he later admitted to regretting that decision . This movie is considered to be the breakthrough film of Burt Reynolds , it marked his transition from acting and starring , this film reflects the start of the period of Reynolds enormous star power and box-office pulling power, his machismo persona being mixed with a critical recognized serious dramatic performance . Gorgeous cinematography by an excellent cameraman , as John Boorman wanted Vilmos Zsigmond as his director of photography as he had famously filmed the 1956 Soviet invasion of Hungary ; Boorman reckoned that anyone who had filmed under the threat of Russian tanks and guns would be ideally suited to such an intensive and grueling shoot as Deliverance promised to be. The motion picture was very good shot by John Boorman , though originally, Sam Peckinpah wanted to direct the movie ; when Boorman secured the rights, Peckinpah directed Straw Dogs instead . John is a real professional filmmaking from the 6os , though sparsely scattered and giving various classics . John started as an assistant direction and his friendship with Lee Marvin allowed him to work in Hollywood as ¨Point Blank¨ (1967) and ¨Hell in the Pacific¨ (1968) from where he returned to the UK and directed ¨Leo¨ (1970) , a rare Sci-Fi titled ¨Zardoz¨ (1974) or the ¨failure Exorcist II¨ (1977). His films are without exception among the most exciting visually in the modern cinema . He became famous for Excalibur (1981), the best of them , ¨Emerald forest¨ (1985) with a ecologist denounce included and his autobiographic story ¨Hope and Glory¨ (1987) and which brought him another Academy Award Nomination after ¨Deliverance¨ . Rating  Better than average . Wholesome watching .

This is one of those films. Voight, Reynolds, Beatty and Cox portray four business acquaintances who head to Northern Georgia for a rugged canoe trip. The river they travel to and the land around it is about to be completely covered by water from a dam being built. They want to see this beautiful terrain in its original form before man alters the lay of the land. Prior to taking off, they encounter people almost foreign to their existence including severely uneducated, malnourished and ill older people, good ol' boy rednecks and, most notably, a mute, inbred boy who comes alive briefly though his banjo when Cox plucks his guitar. Their impromptu duet consists of the legendary Dueling Banjos number and is a moment of humanity and communication that is rarely encountered in the bulk of the rest of the film. Once the quartet has made its way partially down the river, an unfortunate (to say the least) meeting with two savage and sadistic local hunters changes forever the course of the canoe trip, not to mention every man's life. White-knuckle, gut-wrenching suspense kicks in as the men attempt to extricate themselves from a very dangerous situation, all the while being thwarted by the raging force of the river they are on. What, on the surface, is a tough adventure flick is actually a layered, symbolic and very carefully thought-out study of man's relationship with nature, both the geographic kind and the human kind. No one emerges from this canoe trip the same man he was going in. Voight gives a solid performance as a gentle, non-aggressive type. Though he is strong in the film, he is actually less-often remembered than his costars Reynolds and Beatty. Reynolds has here, perhaps, his finest hour. Aside from being ruggedly handsome, his hairy chest pouring out of a skin-tight black, zip-up vest, he is the epitome of macho swagger and manly assurance. Is that, however, enough to get one through an ordeal such as this? Beatty makes an amazing film debut here as the least secure and least aggressive of the men. The brave, raw performance he gives is a lesson in economy. No over-the-top meltdowns here. Just real, shell-shocked emotion. Cox is also good as the man with a strong moral code and an uptight nature. No one in the cast gives a bad performance, including Dickey, the author of the source novel and the screenplay, who plays a sheriff. Special mention must be made, too, of the nauseating, terrifying work of Coward and McKinney, who portray two of the screen's most memorably depraved and callous real villains (i.e. - not aliens, monsters, super-villains, sorcerers, etc...) It's hard to believe a film can be so ugly and yet so beautiful all at once. The scenery is incredible and is beautifully photographed (a must-see in widescreen.) The music is simple and understated, increasing the reality rather than distracting from it. The direction is exquisite. Director Boorman has shown a career-long affinity for stories that take place in the depths of unspoiled nature and few can match his abilities in depicting it. There are a few missteps, though they hardly detract from the overall impression of the film. One is a climbing sequence that stretches credibility to the extreme. Another is the fact that the sequence is filmed using an unfortunate day for night technique that holds up rather badly today and is at odds with the other terrific cinematography. These are quibbles, however, in light of the fact that the film is a masterpiece of tension and an intriguing examination of men, their environment and their relationships with one another. The men in this film had the bad luck to be eligible for awards in the same year as The Godfather which boasted a large, strong, male cast. Moments of Deliverance stay with a viewer for days, perhaps, in some cases, even a lifetime.

I feel sad for the people who find the opening sequence of this film boring.  The sequence when the guys drop off their cars and find themselves in alien territory ranks in suspense with the greatest films ever produced.  Ned Beatty begins by insulting one of the hillbillies who puts him in his place with a cold, You don't know what you're talkin' about.  Then comes the Dueling Banjo sequence where the very talented guitarist, Ronny Cox, is totally done in by that boy. That grotesque, inbred creature, who is in his element, even if they are not.  The last human they see as they move away is this confused looking urchin, watching them, that puppylike puzzlement.  There is also the beautiful (at the beginning) river, where the men paddle their way to what they see as paradise but don't recognize the venomous serpent whose back they are riding on.It's too bad that the first thing everyone thinks of is the sodomy scene. This was unsettling, but necessary, to show the enemy at his disgusting worst.  But there is so much more to this movie.  After the hillbilly is killed, the river becomes the archtypical path to salvation and the road to death.  After all the events of the disposing of the body, the further threats to their existence, the terror continues.  I think the most frightening part of this movie comes after they return to get their cars. Because the river is being rerouted, a cemetery has to be moved, the bodies removed. This is what they have come to. The sheriff is on to them.  They are emotionally wrecked.  The scene as they sit with the locals and eat their dinner, is so full of tension and despair.  Even though they are saved they will never be saved.  As I walked out of Sunday afternoon matinee of this movie I couldn't form words to talk to my friends.  This movie isn't for everyone's tastes, but it certainly is as gripping as anything I have ever seen. Performances are wonderful.  It's too bad Ned Beatty is so sensitive about this because I found his character magnificent.   I've never cared much for Burt Reynolds, but this is perfect casting.  John Voight can show fear like no-one I know; sometimes I wish he could show other emotions.  It's really surprising that none of the cast received an Oscar nomination.  And then there are those mountain men.  Where did they come from?

This film was scary and unexpectedly shocking in 1972. In hindsight I feel it has as much meaning symbolically today as you care to discuss. At the time I thought Burt Reynolds would become one of Hollywood's great dramatic actors but instead he meandered into comedy and superficial roles. I believe he became somewhat of a wasted talent. In this movie, however, he shines. The acting all round is stellar. The storytelling and direction flawless and powerful. Nature is pitted against man. Man against Nature. Man against Man. It is loaded with social and moral issues. The destruction of a virgin wilderness by a dam. The issue of murder, self-defence, escaping from the law but not being able to hide from your conscience (the nightmares of Ed - Jon Voight), the homosexual rape scene, the burial and dumping of bodies, the stills for moonshine in the backwoods, the duelling banjoes - brilliant scenes that make this film memorable while set against a backdrop of raging rivers and pristine wilderness. The filming of going down river is incredible. No insurance company would get involved in this one so perhaps Angelina Jolie would not be here today if Jon Voight had slipped climbing that cliff.The Church of Christ confronting them on the road at the end, the sense of relief out of the water, the genial dinner with the gentle town folk, the shimmering light in the faces of Jon Voight & Burt Reynolds when they first see the river, the nightmarish image of the rising hand out of the water in Jon Voight's dream at the end - haunting images that will last a lifetime.

From then on the film never relents as the overconfidence and naivety of the city boys is juxtaposed to the sights and sounds of the wilderness - its beauty and its terror.The film's famous scenes have been well documented and critiqued in other reviews but it is also some of the subtle touches that I have come to appreciate. Bobby dismisses the rusted old wrecks that litter the yard of the hillbillies at the beginning of the film but almost embraces the wrecks that are the first sign of civilization and salvation from the horrors and dangers of the wilderness at the end of the trip. Later Bobby gladly eats dinner with the locals and displays no sense of the superiority he felt at the beginning. In fact he enjoys their hospitality and down home conversation. A lesson learnt the hard way.The acting by the four leads is brilliantly real but is the locals who lend the film such a heightened sense of reality. They are physically and emotionally detached from the city boys - this is their world.Lastly - nature doesn't play favourites.

The idea of the trip is really that of the leader of the group, rugged outdoor macho man Lewis Medlock (Burt Reynolds). Along with him are married, meditative, pipe-smoking art dealer Ed Gentry (Jon Voight), family man and guitar-playing sales supervisor Drew Ballinger (Ronny Cox), and chubby bachelor insurance salesman Bobby (Ned Beatty). The last two are out of their element, and there is an eerie feeling all around. A major factor is the cultural clash and hostility of the mountain people; the film shows the effects of inbreeding among them. Sensing a perilous omen, Ed urges early on, Look, Lewis, let's go back to town and, ah . . . play golf. As it turned out, it would have been better for the four men had Lewis heeded Ed's advice.The Dueling Banjoes scene featuring Drew with the deformed albino youngster (Billy Redden), which occurs less than ten minutes into the film, is a classic. After that the first day of paddling is quiet and unassuming two men in each of two canoes. Later, on land, Ed takes aim at a deer with bow and arrow but misses. The problems begin on the following day (less than forty minutes into the movie), when Bobby and Ed canoe ahead and land, and soon are assaulted by two armed hillbillies. They have many missing teeth. Bobby is sodomized and only Lewis' timely arrival stops further damage. Lewis shoots one of the hillbillies (Bill McKinney) through the torso with a deft arrow; the other escapes (Herbert Cowboy Coward). The four men argue how the handle the tricky situation bury the hillbilly or notify the authorities. Lewis' idea wins out over Drew's after he claims that all of the locals are related, and a later trial will not be a fair one. So the corpse is buried. But disaster, in the form of nature, strikes again. When the men resume paddling they hit a stretch of rapids. Suddenly a shot is thought to ring out, spilling Drew into the drink. While Drew disappears below the waterline, the other men are dashed against the rocks. Lewis breaks his right leg as the men come to rest in a gorge against a cliff where a hillbilly armed with rifle waits above. Now Ed must become the leader of what's left as Lewis' role is minimal for the rest of the feature. Barely able to speak, Lewis urges Ed to climb the cliff to go after the hillbilly. With much difficulty Ed scales the cliff and dispatches the mountain man, but also wounds himself in the process. Upon closer examination it is not entirely clear that the second dead hillbilly was indeed the surviving perpetrator. Anyway, the latest corpse is tossed into the river. After recovering Drew's body, weighing it down, and sending it back under the waterline, the three survivors struggle to make it back to a local town (Aintry). They have to get their stories straight and then notify the local authorities. Their dilemma is a moral one. The visual effects of Deliverance are stunning, the acting superior, and the narrative gripping. The story is a disturbing one, in which the author of the book, ecology-minded James Dickey, sees a wild nature turning on a civilized but tactless man. Characters are developed, and we experience how each one reacts to his own personal situation. By the way, author Dickey is investigating sheriff Bullard; a young Ed O'Neill plays a police officer in the hospital at the end. This feature represents one of the best films of 1972.

It's pretty close to the book as well, probably as a result of Dickey writing the screenplay. John Boorman takes up the director's duties and needs to be given considerable credit for ensuring the feel of the novel is kept intact, while still making sure this is a very cinematic experience. The movie is about what happens when men are pushed simultaneously to the extreme of their psychological and the physical limits. Although it is about a whole lot more than that. It also is about town vs. country, where civilisation ends. And it is underpinned by the social situation where an impoverished people are forced out of their homeland to make way for a dam to service the city folks. With this in mind, it's unsurprising that it contrasts the city people's rape of the mountain peoples land, with the physical rape carried out in the story by the mountain men on the city slickers.The setting of Deliverance is one of its chief strengths. The Georgia backwoods location and the hillbillies who populate it make for an unforgettable backdrop to the narrative. The wild beauty of the landscape and river contrasts jarringly with the poverty stricken locals. The hillbillies are extremely authentic, making their later aggression all the more frightening of course. The story itself is pretty simple. Four city men go on a canoe trip down a river before a dam floods the entire area. Half-way down one of the party is assaulted by hillbillies, leading to the killing of one of the assailants. This situation leads to a moral dilemma and ultimately more violence.The cast is excellent. Burt Reynolds plays Lewis, the alpha male of the group, Jon Voight is Ed the meek everyman, Ned Beatty is Bobby, the slightly obnoxious one and Ronny Cox is Drew, the man of principle. The way that the story pans out results in strong characters becoming weak and vice-versa. The men are left forever changed by their experiences on this river trip. The violence is ugly and realistic throughout; and when Ed finally kills the murderous hillbilly on the cliff it's achieved in a very clumsy manner and is pretty far removed from typical film violence. The horror of the story is contrasted quite a bit by the beauty of the natural world where it happens. The cinematography is excellent throughout and the acoustic music has an organic feel. The latter, of course, peaks early on in the unforgettable duelling banjos sequence which remains one of the best moments from any movie, not only just Deliverance. The inbred boy Lonnie is a character that is impossible to forget once seen and the scene as a whole is an inspired way that music is used to highlight the culture clash about to happen. Later, the horrendous scene on the riverbank, illustrates the extremity of this cultural clash. It's a testament to the power of Deliverance that both the phrases 'duelling banjos' and 'squeal like a pig' have seeped into our culture to the extent that virtually everyone knows what they refer to.A film of ideas and contrasts, and one that captures a people and place that probably don't exist anymore, Deliverance is a bona fide classic that deserves its reputation.

Beautifully shot by Vilmos Zigmond (although a few manipulated day for night shots look a bit wacky). The film moves at an even, moderate pace, without ever hurting the tension or drama. Thematically, it is an examination of the destructive nature of male machismo, the price of survival, the darkness of the human heart, the lies we're willing to tell ourselves and the world to get on, and the split between those of the land and those who use the land. These are not small themes, and sometimes they're a little too on the nose (e.g. dialogue like 'sometimes you have to get lost to find yourself' &#x96; although I'm not sure if the film is embracing that platitude or making very dark fun of it). At other times exactly what it's saying seems a bit fuzzy, or like it wants to have all its thematic cakes and eat them too. (Men need to be challenged to find their real self, but &#x96; on the other hand &#x96; trying to find your 'real self' may be an illusory path to your own destruction, literal or metaphoric). Also, I could see the people of Appalachia, who already carry understandable anger as being constantly portrayed as stupid, inbred and violent, taking offense to the film, and they'd have a point. Yet all that said, this is a movie that's more about a visceral experience than a collage thesis dissection, and that is where 'Deliverance' excels. It takes us to hell, and only partly back, and we get immersed in the journey in a way all too few films pull off. It is quite like being lost in a bad dream. And I mean that as a compliment.

The naturalist Cox - the solitary figure - laments the industrialisation of the planet and representing the industrialist, Beatty struggles to adapt to the demands of the wild without civilised boundaries for protection. McKinney and Coward in brief but terrifying roles are the epitome of the outback villain, their opportunistic crimes brutal and merciless.While its easy to focus on the film's immortal scene, the pig reference from which is now oft quoted, for me the penultimate moment in the film happens when Voight attempts to shoot a deer, revealing the innate weakness he's subsequently compelled to overcome in the true test of survival. Great atmosphere, score (Duelling Banjos) and several chilling moments guarantee a classic that should transcend time and imitations (The River Wild comes to mind). It's just a shame that director Boorman didn't do more in his sparse career.

Now that may seem obvious to people, but after seeing it being referenced in so many horror films, I was sort of expecting a 70's styled slasher films, but actually what I got was a lot more. Deliverance has a harrowing realistic atmosphere that gets lost in most films today. It's that atmosphere and realism that makes Deliverance quite a disturbing and frightening film, even for todays standards.Thinking back, not that much happens four people go off on a canoe, two hill billies arrive and they go off to kill the hill billies and the hill billies go off to kill the foursome. It doesn't seem like a lot, but it's the long drawn-out scenes and clean directing that makes Deliverance an extremely mature and unique film, especially for when it was made. Some scenes are extremely shocking for todays standards, the squeal like a pig scene is very disturbing, and the little banjo boy is very unnerving thanks to his lack of dialogue and unnatural responses. The duelling banjo scene is also quite electrifying, in just the way it's composed and executed.Conclusively Deliverance is a slightly different fright film, that has some fantastic directing and a great maturity that seems way ahead of its time. It's not a naff 70's horror film with piercing music and bad special effects. It's a very memorable tense drama with an unnervingly realistic atmosphere and intimidating cinematography. Its effects are also really good and so are the performances. Give Deliverance a go, I'll certainly be revisiting that canoing trip.

But 40 years have hardly phased its capacity to make viewers shudder.Comfortable urban America seems to harbour some dread of things going haywire in the wilderness. Probably a hang-over from the days of Indian conflict. Here its the white tribes isolated hillbillies and their inbreeding, and a complete absence of civilised conduct. Our four heroes take the adventure holiday from hell, as their sojourn in the wilds takes on a very grim aspect indeed.The movie stars Burt Reynolds in an unusually straight role, played with a very keen edge. Jon Voight, soon after his success in 'Midnight Cowboy', still manages to look outwardly vulnerable, but is ultimately proved to be the real survivor. Ned Beatty always gives an excellent B-list return, whilst an unassuming Ronny Cox makes up the quartet. They really do look like 4 mix-n-match friends out for a good time that never happens.Filming highlights the wilderness to amazing effect. It looks gloriously expansive, violently dramatic, and frighteningly claustrophobic by turns as the story moves forward from fun adventure to bitter survival. The sense of loss and isolation is perfectly realised. The comfortably familiar becomes strange and threatening.And whilst all of this is going forward, there is the idealised evaluation of minds raised to comply with rules, accept moral tenets, and endeavour to see a broader responsibility beyond the immediacy of survival that raises 'Deliverance' above the similarly themed 'Southern Comfort'.Well worth a watch, though at times it still makes very uncomfortable viewing. It was nominated for 3 Oscars, and was probably denied them on account of its subject matter. Horror-thrillers tend to be dismissed by academic and art-house selection.One thing's for certain; you'll remember this minutely-observed small cast of characters and their complex plight, long after the CGI hoards of epics like 'Rings' have become an incomprehensible montage.

The movie is very faithful to the book, not surprising since James Dickey wrote both and also played the part of the Sheriff in this movie. The movie was filmed on location and because it was considered so risky, the production couldn't get insurance for the project. The actors, all excellent, had to do nearly all of their own stunt work. I've done a lot of whitewater rafting and have had to swim through some very dangerous rapids after falling out of the raft once or twice---believe me, it is not something you do for fun. John Boorman's movies usually have the theme of man versus man and man versus Nature and Deliverance is no exception. The four city businessmen are out to canoe down one of Georgia's last wild rivers before it is dammed up and flooded. They find themselves in a totally alien world of backwoods hillbillies such that you can scarcely believe that the city men and the country folk are from the same country. The story of course is familiar to everyone. The city men enjoy their trip down the river until the second day when, separated on the water and stopping to wait for the trailing canoe, two of the men, Ed and Bobby, are confronted by two hillbillies who are intent on brutally raping them. The rape scene is still harrowing and I would suspect was the first male/male rape scene in movie history. Given it was Ned Beatty's first movie role, the man should've merited some Oscar consideration for taking that risk with his career. The actors playing the hillbillies are amongst the most frightening characters in movie history.The second canoe arrives just after the assault on Bobby ends and the mountain men turn their attention to Ed. Lewis, one of the other canoeists, kills one of the rapists with his bow and the other rapist flees into the hills. The four city men then debate what to do next, take the body with them downriver and report it to the authorities, or just bury the body and get out of there, knowing that the river is going to be flooded in a few weeks. This scene is also powerful because they have to decide where does the law abide? Is it imposed on us and therefore can be discarded as circumstances demand, or is is within ourselves and must be followed regardless of the repercussions? Drew, who is conscience-stricken, is outvoted by the other three.The rest of the trip involves more death, possible murder or killing in self-defense, more lies, more evasions until the survivors are finally able to make their getaway, but are haunted by their consciences. And what would you do in that situation? Everyone who watches this movie will ask himself what he would do if it happened to him. . .Oh, and by the way, the movie of course lent itself to a standard joke amongst whitewater rafters---we're not stopping for any hillbillies we find on the riverbank!

It's a contrived idea that's based on reality not fantasy. What would I do if I was in that situation? That's a very terrifying thing to consider. That's why Deliverance holds up very well since its initial release in 1972.Burt Reynolds gave what is arguably his best performance (with the possible exceptions of Starting Over and Boogie Nights). His character Lewis was the ultimate macho man at the beginning of the film but in the end, because of the incidents on the river, is knocked down a few notches literally and figuratively.Jon Voight's character Ed was certainly the heart and soul of the movie; Testing himself to the limit to survive a very extraordinary situation. Voight gave a very multi-layered performance.Ronny Cox's character Drew seem to be the most rational of the four characters. He wanted to do the right thing. He was able to communicate with the banjo playing kid at the beginning. Cox made me care about Drew and his character's fate. Although he's been in a number of movies and TV shows since Deliverance (notably, The Onion Field and the final season of St. Elsewhere) I don't think the roles that Cox has performed has had the same type of quality in his debut performance.Bill McKinney and Herbert Cowboy Coward are only in the movie for about 10 minutes. They are two of the most terrifying villains in screen history. (It was nice to see McKinney in The Green Mile as a prison guard who's responsible for the operating the levers for the electric chair.)As for Ned Beatty, i've been a fan of his for many years. (Of note, Network, the first two Superman movies, the great TV movie Friendly Fire, Homicide Life on the Street, and others.) It's a shame that some moviegoers still tease him about his character's compromising situation. Do some people realize that the movie is very faithful to the novel? It certainly doesn't hurt that James Dickey wrote both the novel and the screenplay.Having read the novel, I wondered how they were going to handle the scene when Ed and Bobby were held at shotgun point. As I mentioned before, I believe that the situation is not as impossible as some insensitive people might think. Didn't anyone realize that just like Ed, Bobby is a survivor? He may have been victimized but with the help of Ed, and prayer (he whispered Oh God, deliver us from this...) but he did survive. Beatty's performance has stuck with me since I first saw the movie in the early 1980's.Director John Boorman has had his ups (Excalibur, Hope and Glory) and downs (Exorcist II The Heretic) in his career.

Rather than relying on endless explosions and special effects, it instead focuses on a few dramatic scenes.  Modern viewers might find this boring, but real life isn't non-stop action either.  It also had Jon Voight playing the character of the civilized man, unwilling and unable to defend himself in the wild; a modern movie with today's cynical views would have no place for such a person.I was surprised at how a pre-mustache Burt Reynolds showed some serious acting talent; I wonder how his career might have been different if he hadn't become the character he played in Smokey and the Bandit.My final comment is that this movie strikes close to home to me on many points.

Now you probably ask yourself what that has to do with this movie. Well, a lot more than you might expect because Deliverance isn't a comedy like the other one is, but the entire story is pretty similar. Both are adventure movies in which a couple of friends go on a canoing trip in the middle of nowhere, where they will find themselves in some dangerous situations. But the main difference between the two is that this one was made for an adult audience and that Without A Paddle is intended for teenagers. And it shows. While Deliverance is a very nice movie, Without a Paddle certainly isn't...Deliverance tells the story of four men from the city who want to canoe down the Cahulawassee River, which soon will be lost because the entire surroundings will be flooded once the construction of a nearby dam is finished. At first it all seems to be an idyllic and adventurous trip through some magnificent landscapes, but soon they get more than they bargained for. They already met the local population at the village where they started the trip and at first they all seemed rather retarded, but nice. But once they are in the middle of nowhere, the locals become more and more of a threat...I've seen about four hundred movies the past 10 months, but I don't think there is any movie from which I'll still recognize the music after a couple of weeks, except for this one. The song 'The Duelling Banjos' in the beginning is not only very captivating and hard to resist, it's probably one of the best known movie songs ever. But not only the music is nice, so are the entire story, the acting and the photography...The story is so good because it is plausible. It isn't difficult to make an overly dramatic, but unbelievable movie with this story line, but the makers have avoided that trap perfectly. What they have done is portraying a threatening situation in such a good way, that you'll be sitting on the edge of your seat from the moment all misery starts. And when it is all over, you're glad that you weren't the one that had to deal with it all. That's of course also thanks to the excellent performances by the four leads. Jon Voight, Burt Reynolds, Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox all play their roles so well that you immediately forget that you're watching some well known actors. I might even say that these were probably the very best roles of their lives. Especially Burt Reynolds has never been better than in this movie.All in all this is a classic that shouldn't be missed. In these days you get to see such bad movies that you start wondering if Hollywood has always made such awful things. The answer is no, just check movies like this one and be convinced that they once used to make some very classy productions that are able to keep you focused from the first moment till the last.

Since I'm in my 30's I'm just old enough to remember when it was relatively new when I was a kid; it's one of those movies that I never got around to seeing.I was expecting it to be interesting, but was surprised to find it to be a real classic; it's a great American movie...minimalist, raw, painted on a big canvas.Even though I had never seen the movie, except for the dueling banjos scene (they showed it in sound class in film school), it was interesting how much of it I had picked up via osmosis with American pop culture over the years. I felt like I had seen it before, but only in a dream. An interesting phenomenon.I can remember kids in grade school talking about the Squeel like a Pig scene; I wasn't sure what they were getting at; I didn't know what regular sex was, much less rape, much less male-on-male rape. Finally seeing the scene after all these years it was both more comical (I mean come on, look at those awful briefs they put Ned Beatty in) and more bizarre than I could have imagined. The way it all climaxes (no pun intended) with the hillbilly squeeling, twisting Ned's ear, Ned squeel's at a lower pitch, and then repeat, over and over again, is just disturbing and very funny in a freaky kind of way. It is almost a reprise of the dueling banjos scene, except now it's dueling pigs. I think the fact that the hillbilly has this very alarming, high-pitched, intense squeel, while Ned Beatty's is kind of half-hearted, broken, and pathetic shows the attention to detail in the movie that makes it so effective.The key to this movie is that it is tapping into our primal fears. It has the quality of Greek Tragedy, mixed with a documentary-like realism. That combination is extremely satisfying and must be difficult to achieve. That is, the movie is full of startling moments of realism (i.e. the great moment at the gas pump when Ned Beatty is ribbing the old guy about the way he wears his hat, and the fella takes off his hat, looks at it, then deadpans, You don't know a damn thing) but the realism is always in the service of the mythological tale of the journey down a strange river into darkness. It is a very similar movie to Apocalypse Now; less dreamy, more real; less horrifying but more intense. I think I like Deliverance better but I haven't seen Coppola's movie recently. An interesting couple of films nonetheless.I especially like the character of the banjo-picking boy; he truly serves the role of some mute Old Testament prophet. Somehow the entire disaster about to unfold is contained in the disturbing, long, and penetrating look he gives the travellers from the swinging bridge as they pass under him into unknown territory.I figured there would be a few reviews on here by folks getting all self-righteous and politically correct about the depiction of hillbillies. I'm from Kentucky originally myself and kind of take to the weirdos at the gas station more than Burt Reynolds in a rubber shirt, but, you know...get over it.

It's the the kind of hillbilly sounding one, Ronny Cox's character, Drew, plays with the mentally-challenged looking kid in the beginning of the film, which sets the unsettling mood 'Deliverance' possesses throughout it's entire runtime. I found 'Deliverance' to be a great film that will go down (if it hasn't already) as a classic. It wasn't as action-packed as I expected, but more dramatic which is probably why it won three Academy Award Nominations including 'Best Motion Picture of the Year'. 'Deliverance' is a great, intense and memorable film, that doesn't move very fast but it really doesn't have to.The story follows four friends from the city of Atlanta Ed (Jon Voight - Midnight Cowboy), Lewis (Burt Reynolds - Smokey and the Bandit), Drew (Ronny Cox - Beverly Hills Cop), and the fat little piggy, Bobby (Ned Beatty - Network). To get away for the weekend, Lewis takes the three on a canoe trip in the creepy backwoods of Georgia to a lush and beautiful river that will be destroyed in a week's time to make room for a huge lake. They are having a fun and exciting getaway in the woods, when suddenly everything goes to sh*t. The four come across crazed in-bred butt-raping violent mostly-toothless locals that threaten the band of friends' lives. The movie then shifts from fun and happy to the intense and thrilling adrenaline rush that is 'Deliverance'. Jon Voight is spectacular as the lead character, Ed. Ed is a unsure of himself kind of guy, who when put into the frightening situation they are put in, has to pull it together. Voight provides such depth and passion to his otherwise kind of bleak character, it should have gotten him an Academy Award nomination for Best Lead Actor. Burt Reynolds is marvelous in one of his finest performances, as the tough, brave and outgoing Lewis, who is the natural leader of the friends. Ned Beatty is perfectly cast as the token fat little guy, and Ronny Cox is actually quite good in his role as the guitar strumming nice guy, Drew. The actors who played the crazy rednecks succeeded in creeping the hell out of me, also. John Boorman provides incredible direction to an incredible script, and I also loved the wondrous scenery that 'Deliverance' had.All in all, 'Deliverance' is a good cult film. If you don't find it too disturbing (that 'squeal like a piggy' scene really got under my skin), I think you'll appreciate the crafty film-making that 'Deliverance' is. In conclusion, 'Deliverance' has top-of-the-line directing, writing and acting, and it is important because it serves as a warning to those who view the film not to go camping in places you don't feel 100% comfortable in.

It uses it, but does not believe in it.It's the 4 businessmen who take the trip who participate in the proliferation of this stereotype. From a karmic standpoint, they bring it on themselves. Their attackers are 'bad', of course, but not representative of all people who live in rural poverty. In the end, the attack plays a very small part in what the movie is really about. It's about whether these 4 guys can hack it if they were removed from the confines of civilization. The conclusion is, no sir, they sure can't.The banjo player seems to be foreshadowing not so much their imminent danger but rather the beauty and skill at work in this simple (even downright ugly) setting. Drew sort of gets it, but the other guys view the banjo player as a freak, worthy of their attention only because of his deformity and playing ability. If they had acknowledged the sheer humanity of the people they meet at the beginning, they might have known how to handle themselves later on. What's at stake in this film is always subtle, just below the surface. It's not a movie about rednecks screwin' city slickers.

The photography of the wilderness environment and the whitewater scenes is impressively stunning. The acting, too, is excellent, although one indeed can imagine the ambivalence Ned Beatty must have felt on accepting the part, considering what happens to him. And it is indeed compelling, gripping and very creepy. The viewer is sucked into the vortex as a weekend adventure turns slowly and inexorably into a nightmare.My problem is with the film's meaning. Many issues are considered here - wilderness vs. civilization, rural vs. urban life, nature vs. technology, morality, justice, law. However I cannot see a clear viewpoint on any of these on the part of the author and the film maker. Maybe Dickey is proposing the fundamental bestiality of man, who knows?

Although, since the first scenes, I thought the movie was basing its whole story on hillbilly stereotypes, the originality later stood out, as well as the balls on the director to portray such intense moments, like the famous Ned Beatty rape scene or when Drew's (Ronny Cox) body is found. I've seen a lot of people claiming the slow rhythm or the lack of dialogue make the film boring, but neither bored me at all (another great point, since that's very uncommon to me). Mostly because, after a while, there are great, nerve wrecking and creepy sequences, which put you on the edge of your seat. Complementing, the Apallachian Mountains scenery is greatly explored, playing a huge part on the plot and providing unique cinematography. Plus, all the cast offer astonishing performances, with Jon Voight and Ned Beatty standing out, in my opinion. I'm not rating Deliverance higher, though, because for me the movie functioned as pure entertainment as would any other shallow action/thriller, without any deep meaning or reflection (at least I couldn't find one), besides not enjoying the graphic violence so much (while respecting the director's choices). However, I do not discredit the excellent portrayal of the dangerous relation between nature and the very interesting characters.The ending did bother a lot of people too, as I've been reading, but, honestly, if you can only enjoy a movie when the facts are all given out ready for you till the end, you're missing out too much of cinema. Not every story will end on a simple bright picture, or attend your innocent expectations.For these reasons, I do highly recommend watching Deliverance, even if you don't enjoy a disturbing story like this, watch it for Jon Voight, or simply because it is a classic.

The first one depicts an amicable musical dispute between one of the main characters (Drew) and a local boy, the second a scene where other main character (Bobby) is humiliated and sodomized by another far less amicable local. Both scenes (in very different ways, that's for sure), convey human interaction in pre-Babbel form, two scenes that don't lean on language and make us feel good and evil in their purest form, in this tale where Men returns to the Wild and, therefore, must be confronted with it.'Deliverance' is a downbeat adventure drama film directed by John Boorman in 1972, starring Burt Reynolds, Jon Voight, Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox as the four city men who trade their golf weekend for a canoe adventure down the Cahulawassee River in Southern U.S., before this last piece of native, wild America disappears underwater after the construction of a dam. But things start to unravel for the four adventurers, who soon find themselves fighting for survival on a land where civilization laws are not applicable.Cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond does a tremendous job capturing the beautiful wild, landscape in tones of green and smooth gold. The four main actors are all up to the characters they play, as proved by the scenes when moral discussion arises and each of them must make their point on the subject. The soundtrack is minimal and mostly replicate the Nature sounds that surround our four men on their adventure, with some keys of banjo here and there, which really helps to delve in the story.In sum, 'Deliverance' is an effective adventure film, which counts with great photography, interpretations and soundtrack to convey a story of instinct and survival over civilization, where good and evil are shown in their most raw form and every major plot event is pondered and brings irreversible consequences for the future. So it is the way of Nature.

Even more incredible is the on-location shooting in Georgia which results in some beautiful images and taut thrills as the four men make their way down the river. The only complaint I really have is that towards the end, it slows down a lot and the way some of the story is wrapped up drags on for a few minutes too long.

For some reason, I immediately compared the film to Predator &#x96; 'I thought the surroundings in Predator were good, but Deliverance beats it by far with the beautiful untouched countryside and the Cahulawassee River that runs through it.' I continued, saying that Deliverance is a 'masterful portrayal of each man's change of character under stress'. I was initially surprised by the maturity of that comment, but I'm fairly sure I copied it from the DVD case. I rounded the review off by naming it a 'real treat' and a 'top notch thriller'. Despite its plagiarism and mere 110 word length, I agree with the little I wrote 9 years ago. The film was 33 at the time; it is now 42 and as good as ever.The film, which is based on the book by James Dickey, follows Ed (Jon Voight), Drew (Ronny Cox), Bobby (Ned Beatty) and Lewis (Burt Reynolds). The three men are contented, middle-class executives who would gladly play golf in lieu of hunting, climbing and rafting. The only reason the trip happened was because of Lewis, a competitive, playground bully and some sort of survivalist. Unlike the others, he has no time for humour in the Georgia wilderness; he takes himself and the trip very seriously, appearing to consider it a spiritual exercise akin to the Aboriginal tradition of walkabout.The unlikable Lewis almost immediately takes a churlish disliking to Bobby, addressing him as 'chubby', barking orders at him and interrupting him with smug, portentous monologues about his ostensible understanding of their majestic, harsh surroundings. Before the relationships between the four men can be explored in a normal fashion, they are thrown into an extraordinary situation in a scene that has since become infamous for its line 'squeal like a piggy'. What follows is a thriller that achieves an uncommon resonance because of the everyday, almost banal qualities of its characters; they are real people in a real situation rather than stock characters being assailed by monstrous caricatures.Like I said in 2005, it is indeed a beautifully verdant film. The 'Cahulawasse River' isn't a real river, the turbulent rapids and beautiful surrounding forests that we see are that of the Chattooga River in Georgia. The landscape and their traversing of it is well captured; I shared the four men's expressions of wired engrossment as they negotiated the dangerous rapids with the utmost concentration, and I felt their elation too when they reached the tranquillity of the calmer waters. The excellent Blu-Ray surround sound places you there, it enveloped me with the interminable sounds of buzzing insects and rushing water. Despite everything that happens in Deliverance, the film certainly makes me want to travel.The wild local people were well cast, they were seemingly picked from some West Virginia backwood, providing the film with a morbid authenticity. Perhaps the most memorable villager is the teenage banjo virtuoso played by Billy Redden in the famous Duelling Banjos sequence. He was picked from a school in the local area and isn't actually playing the banjo, the arms and fingers we see actually belong to a musician sitting behind the bench with his arms through Redden's sleeves. While the film is best known for its plucking banjos, it makes great use of a synthesiser in a few instances, producing this chilling monotone hum that works particularly well when Ed become entangled underwater.The performances are good, but they aren't given that much dramatic range as there isn't much dialogue, for large portions of the film the performances rely on physicality. I am nit- picking here and not entirely decided, but with his wide-eyed expressions and animated ungainly movements, I felt that Voight was at times rather exaggerated in his conveyance of being a city slicker unused to the rugged Appalachian terrain. It is perhaps Ned Beatty's assailant Bill McKinney who deserves the most praise, because as Burt Reynolds points out during the 40th anniversary reunion of the four men, he kept his eyes open without fault for a quite remarkable length of time, anyone who's been locked in a bitter staring competition can attest that it's no small feat!I haven't read James Dickey's novel, I have found it quite a difficult book to find, but I have heard that, unsurprisingly, the characters are given a more detailed backstory. I would have welcomed a longer film with greater character development, but it works admirably as a stripped down survivalist thriller.Deliverance is one of those films that I will always be fond of. My first viewing came at a time when my cinematic horizons were rapidly broadening along with my prized DVD collection, which I proudly ordered and compartmentalised in rectangular shelves across my bedroom walls. I'm glad that I can say without reservation that one of my favourite films still holds up.92%www.hawkensian.com "},{"Title":"Beautiful, but very haunting","Date":"14 August 2014","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Thriller","Review":" Deliverance is based on James Dickey's bestseller about four men embarked on an dangerous and violent canoe trip through an raging river. Dickey states in his novel that one day, the American wilderness will soon expired because of the technology that we have today. He states that the rivers and streams in the wild is very useful to our environment. Even after Dickey's passing, we still today struggle through this hardship. The fact that in today's world, the environment is still hanging in the balance.The movie version of the bestseller is a perfectly great example of his theory. Four Atlanta businessmen, Ed, (Jon Voight), Lewis, (Burt Reynolds), Drew, (Ronny Cox), and Bobby, (Ned Beatty), are spending their weekend canoeing down an Georgia river that will soon turn into a lake, thanks to the local power company damming the river. The four men all come from different backgrounds and perspectives. Ed is a mild- mannered everyday man who has a wife, a kid and a profession he enjoys. Lewis is a outdoors-man. He is very concerned by the fact that the river is turning into a lake. He even has his philosophy about machines taking over the land that America sits on. Drew is a very deeply moral person. He doesn't seem to bother anybody since he spends most of his time playing his guitar. Bobby is a lovable, sometimes clumsy person who seems to have a big heart. In the beginning of their canoe trip, the group tries to communicate with the locals by telling them that they want someone to drive their cars down to Aintry, which is the closest town near the river. The folks, however, are not very friendly. Some are inbred, while other suffered from the living conditions.After settling in, the boys decides to canoe down the river and along the way, they run into a pair of backwoods men. One of them is a mountain man, (Bill McKinney), who turns the movie into a very sinister adventure film. As the canoe trip becomes more and more dangerous to handle, the boys find themselves in constant danger after committing an murder in the woods since one of the mountain man raped Bobby. The cinematography of the movie is very beautifully done by Vilmos Zsigmond. He does know how to photograph unfake shots of the mountains and especially the white water. The whole movie is very well- photographed since the movie has a very deceiving look of the wilderness. It also as if there's something evil lurking under something beautiful. It always nice to see a movie where there's an authentic look and feel of nature itself. Even though some people never went canoeing down a river, this is a perfect example what could happen when you travel through the rapids and the jagged rocks that are in the river.One of the best scenes in Deliverance is when Drew and a local boy feud against each other with their musical instruments. Drew is strumming his guitar, peacefully. The local boy, with a very dark look on his stoned face, plucks on one of his strings on his banjo. This scene is famously called Dueling Banjos, since the music involves shows the contrasts of city life and country life. Of course, that is very significant in the movie. But never done quite like this before. The attitude that the boys have on the locals is another example of the city life/country life contrast. Lewis seems to taunt the locals by instigating them. But, even with his wisecracks, Lewis doesn't seem to realize that he could wound up being hurt if he doesn't close his mouth.Ever since Deliverance was released, people had mixed feelings toward the way the locals were represented in the movie. Billy Redden, who plays the banjo player, said that he enjoyed working on the movie and said that it is just a movie. Yet some locals thinks the movie is an insult to those who live in deep Georgia. In my opinion, a movie is a movie. I doubt that the makers of this movie were creating a land that was slipping away at the time. In fact, there are a lot of ideas that Deliverance has to offer.Several critics stated that the movie is an allegory of the Vietnam War. To some, that is a very interesting point because according to Lewis, the boys, not knowing that they going into uncharted territory, are raping the land. They have no idea what they are about to get into. That statement can be made about the ongoing Vietnam War that was going on at that time. And besides, the unforgettable climax of the movie is a example of what the American soldiers experienced while coming to America. The fact that Ed, suffers from what happened on the river. Not only Ed, but Lewis, Bobby and even Drew.Out of all of the movies that Burt Reynolds starred in, this is his best. This movie is long before he starred in Smokey and the Bandit in 1977. His performance in Deliverance is great and also interesting because you think that they would hired an different actor to play Lewis. But, Reynolds is outstanding. He doesn't grandstand or overact his part. He plays Lewis very sharp. Jon Voight, who at the time was struggling to become a serious actor is very well-casted in this movie. To me, Voight plays Ed in a very mild-mannered way. He is very open- minded especially in a scene where the boys talk about what they are going to do with the body. Voight in that scene holds himself back while the others try to figure out what to do. The two lesser known actors, Ronny Cox and Ned Beatty, did a very good job. Beatty is perfect as Bobby, the clumsy and always cheerful businessman. ★★★★ 4 stars.

The other three of course, who of course aren't nobody's deliver good performances too, but it was Beatty's here that stayed with me as one of the humiliated and raped victims of two rednecks yokels having some fun, which soon backfires nastily, yet really the violence here was kept to a minimum, it almost had me pi..ed to be honest, which as revenge fare, with more blood, it would of been better, as from the viewers point, to really see these fu..ers get what they deserved. Yes, I'm saying these two really deserved to die, for what they did as fun loving friends, Reynolds, Beatty, Voight, and Cox, the not so fortunate one, who I liked too, weren't hurting anybody and were just out to have a good time. I've read the script, which I must say, you should look up, as just for description. The movie moves at such a nice (some impatients out there, would say a grinding) pace, which I liked, though I guess evben I was slightly irked at this factor, but it made the film more real. What also impressed me was the aftermath, after committing the murders of the yokels, how they dealed with it, and conspired to cover the truth, where in the real world, is how you do it, or how you answer under pressure, when faced with authorities. Yet, still in this situation, I don't really think you could get away squeaky clean, and too these two these creepy yokel cops smelt a lot of suspicion. The last scene with Voight, lying next to his wife on his return home, was almost eerie, in light of what he's been through. On the whole, Deliverance is a one of those olden golden hits, that leaves it mark, with few other classic 70 stuff.

Many of them managed to push the envelope in some way that made them controversial for the era. There was Joe (nudity and casual drug use), Little Big Man (portrayal of gay characters), and Looking For Mr. Goodbar (promiscuous sex). You only needed to see Deliverance one time to be affected by it forever. No amount of time can pass that will allow you to forget it's most memorable scenes - Dueling Banjos, THAT scene with Ned Beatty, Drew's horrific drowning and the dislocated arm, and finally Ed's nightmare hand coming up out of the water of the newly formed lake.I just watched the film again and the passage of time has not diminished it's forceful impact. The picture has a unique ability to put you in a canoe right alongside it's principal players and force one to react to the events on screen as a participant. It sets up all sorts of moral dilemmas regarding a reaction to Lewis's (Burt Reynolds) shooting of the mountain man, the hiding of the body, and of course the forcible rape of Bobby (Beatty). The reactions of the four principals run the gamut of emotions, and it's an uncomfortable prospect to determine which of the adventurers one identifies with most.The way director Boorman works with nature also needs to be commended. The rapids scene in which the men capsize and fight for their life is extremely well staged and is executed flawlessly. On the matter of Drew's (Ronny Cox) death, the picture sets up a myriad of conflicting opinions on how he fell into the river, leading to a unique topic of discussion all by itself. Personally, I've come to consider that he simply blacked out over his participation in the hiding of the mountain man's body, although the idea of suicide crossed my mind as well. The suspicion of a gunshot was a variable to add another layer of complexity to the men's plight, all occurring in rapid succession to make their situation all the more bewildering. This whole sequence was very finely crafted.There's another aspect of the picture worth mentioning as well, that being the unlikely manner in which Ed (Jon Voight) becomes the leader of the survivors after Lewis's injury. Recall that earlier scene in which Ed has difficulty in bearing down on a deer with his bow and arrow. This sets up the later scene in which he must find the fortitude to shoot the mountain man before he himself is killed. When I first saw the picture back in the day, it immediately brought to mind a similar scene in Straw Dogs (another groundbreaking film for it's use of violence) in which Dustin Hoffman's character agonized over shooting a bird, then wiping the blood off his hands in an effort to cleanse himself of an awful deed. Of course, Hoffman goes on a rampage to close out that story to protect his wife and property. Similarly, though to a lesser degree, Voight's character calls upon his remaining wits and strength to save the remainder of his party.There's one thing though that I would have changed in the story to make the ending more powerful. In Ed's nightmare, Drew's hand comes up out of the water and Ed wakes up in a cold sweat. I would have preferred an ending in which that actually occurred, thereby adding one more element of ambiguity to the story whereby the potential for discovering Drew's body along with the two dead hillbillies is left an open question. Even so, there's still enough here to marvel at in terms of conflict and suspense. It's a film worth watching for all of it's discomfort.

On that island was a clan that was headed by Jo Van Fleet. In the end all they could do was move and Van Fleet die as the water swallowed up their homes and way of life.The same thing is happening in Deliverance as four executives from Atlanta decide go on a fishing trip one last time two a river that's about to overflow its banks when a dam is being built. A whole town and a way of life is to be summarily wiped out and the locals aren't taking to kindly to city folks even they're from Atlanta and talk kind of like they do. These people might as well be from Mars. In fact in Georgia a certain governor named Gene Talmadge encouraged that kind of division with his county unit rule so that one had to get a majority of counties including the hillbilly ones in order to gain state office. The poor white trash that dominated in these counties had a stranglehold on the politics of Georgia for a generation and a half.The four vacationers, Jon Voight, Burt Reynolds, Ned Beatty, and Ronny Cox get put through all kinds of hell by some of the locals when out on the river. It gets good and personal and draw your own conclusions there. In the end it's a fight for survival.Director John Boorman wisely chose to opt for realism in telling this savage tale. He shot Deliverance on location in the wilds of rural Georgia and used some of the real population as extras to give it a proper flavor. The four leads all perform well and Ronny Cox and Ned Beatty made great big screen debuts that insured both long careers.And there's that Dueling Banjos theme which is actually a guitar and a banjo and once heard will reverberate forever.

Their trip turns into a nightmare, however, when Ed and Bobby are assaulted by vicious hillbillies, and the friends are forced to kill to survive.Not only is John Boorman's Deliverance one of the finest examples of back-woods survival horror ever made, it is also an excellent cautionary tale for anyone planning to exploit the great outdoors. Screw with the environment, the film warns, and the environment will screw you right back (most likely in the ass, and without the aid of lube).Deliverance's four suburban adventurers symbolise civilisation itself, and are content to use and abuse the wilderness to their own advantage while they can, but fail to understand the importance and potential danger of the terrain through which they are travelling. Although Lewis and his pals aren't particularly destructive themselves, they do display a lack of concern about the terrible fate awaiting the Cahulawassee River, and show little respect for the area and its inhabitants, bragging about 'beating' the river, and mocking the locals for their simple ways.Conversely, the river and the indigenous folk that inhabit the surrounding hills are representative of nature as a whole, and both have a hand in dishing out savage retribution to those outsiders who dare to mess them about.Unflinching, brutal, tense and exciting, Deliverance is a masterful exercise in storytelling from director Boorman, who achieves a gritty realism through his genuinely untamed locations, bravura performances from the film's incredible leads (who clearly canoe the river's rapids themselves), and the unconventional decision to cast 'locals' as secondary characters. The film also features a couple of iconic moments that have become synonymous with the whole murderous hillbilly backwoods sub genre the brilliant scene that sees Drew and an inbred youth participating in a musical duel armed with guitar and banjo respectively; and the harrowing rape of poor Bobby by a hillbilly ('Squeal like a pig, boy!'.... Weeeee..... weeeeee!).In fact, my only real criticism of the entire film is a touch of ropey day-for-night photography during Jon Voight's climb up a perilous cliff-face, but this minor technical imperfection ain't going to stop me from awarding maximum marks.

Burt Reynolds plays Lewis, the leader if the group who uses his nature instincts to guide them. Ned Beatty plays Bobby, the klutz of the group.

It's not hard to believe that four guys going on a canoe trip in the Deep South can easily find themselves out of their element and end up in trouble. If the river doesn't kill them, the inbred hillbilly folk certainly will try. And having been in parts of the country that remind me of this movie, it's scary to think that it really could happen.The other good thing about this movie is that, with the exception of the vehicles used in the movie, it could be timeless. You can picture this movie happening today or 30 years ago. Replace the vehicles in the movie with a couple of modern SUV's and it would still work. However, that's not really necessary since who wants to drive their brand new Hummer into hillbillyland? You'd take your old vehicle.Yes, the squeal like a pig scene is scary & brutal, but of course it's supposed to be. The film wouldn't have that scary quality if it was just a couple of hillbillies robbing two of the main characters at gunpoint. Add some forceable sodomy and the situation the two characters find themselves in is far worse than they could have imagined. Thinking about something like that happening to you, and you get the feeling of urgency why they want to get the heck down to Aintree & get out of there.To see this movie properly, you have to rent it. When they show it on TV, it's always so heavily edited that it just looks like four guys going camping.

I will never forget this movie, nor the haunted feeling it left me with after seeing it for the first time.Four men from the city go on a fishing trip somewhere in the wilds of Appalachia, and are attacked by a couple of psychotic hillbillys. The men's vacation quickly turns into a hellish ordeal, and the sense of adventure offered by the challenge of navigating the tricky rapids of a raging river becomes instead a Darwinian lesson in survival of the fittest. This movie is blunt, brutal and intensely affecting. It's a clenched gut of a film; the sour smell of fear and exhaustion that bathes these men by the time the movie is over practically comes wafting from the screen. Jon Voight is the nominal star of the film -- if the movie is about any one of the four men, it's about him. But to single him out is to do a disservice to Burt Reynolds, Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox, all of whom do smashing work and create full-bodied characters in whose lives we become utterly invested.Of course the initial confrontation with the hillbillys and the notorious rape scene are what this movie is remembered for now, but I think in this day of global warming and environmental crisis, it's interesting to re-watch this movie and see how much in tune with environmental issues director John Boorman was when he made it. Through plot exposition, we learn that the river these man are traveling down is being dammed and redirected to make way for development. The men's callous disregard for the natural world comes back to haunt them when the natural world ceases to be a friend and becomes instead an enemy.There are not many films like this one, and certainly few that are as chillingly disturbing.Grade A+ "},{"Title":"Deliverance Fabulous","Date":"21 May 2007","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Thriller","Review":" DeliveranceDeliverance is probably the best adventure movie I've ever seen. It stars Jon Voight, Burt Reynolds, Ned Beatty, and Ronny Cox. A movie that has been influenced many times since its incarnation from book to movie in the year 1972, this is a movie that fully deserves a spot in the Top 250.Plot The movie is based on the James Dickey novel of the same name. While I haven't read Deliverance, it is one my list of books to read because this movie's story was great and history has taught us that books have better stories than their movie. This is the movie that has given people the fear of wilderness, stereotypical rednecks and mountain people (no offense), and the idea of rape. This movie is scary without being a horror film and using realistic ideas. That makes it scary.Acting When the Academy Awards came around, Deliverance was definitely overlooked when it came to acting. Yes there was Marlon Brando for The Godfather but it didn't even get nominations. Jon Voight gave a fantastic performance as a man who is going along for the ride and helps his friends. The real show comes from Burt Reynolds who plays a wild adventurous risk taker who can at times be very reckless. This is where the nomination should have come in.Genre/Quality This fits an adventure film as well as a scary thriller. As I said earlier this is one of the few non-horror films that manages to scare almost everyone who watches it. This movie's quality shows to anyone who knows a good film. This movie has great cinematography and uses the environment as a great advantage. He takes a hostile environment and makes it look very beautiful and it is very deceptive which is exactly what we want to see in a movie. Some of cinema's greatest scenes in history took place in this movie such as the world famous, Dueling Banjos, and the famous assault sequence. Camera angles were fantastic with great views of everything that is going on and great rafting sequences.Overall this is one of the very best adventure movies I've ever seen. I'm still amazed it doesn't have an open spot in the Top 250. I'm hoping that it will soon find a throne. This movie has had many movies influenced by it such as the fabulous, The Descent and many parodies from such great shows as The Simpsons.10/10 "},{"Title":"Disturbing, complex, and adult, Deliverance is one of the best movies of the 70s","Date":"19 February 2007","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Thriller","Review":" Deliverance is a classic motion picture that offers much more than just the squeal like a pig sequence. Its a horrifying portrait of men invading territory that they know little about. It also started the backwoods brutality film cycle and remains the only masterpiece from that largely reprehensible sub-genre. Even today, it has the power to disturb and ranks as John Boorman's second best film (right after his flawless slice of neo-noir Point Blank). This and Taxi Driver are two films from the 70s that still retain their power to disturb. And like Taxi Driver, Deliverance is never mere exploitation.What makes this film work so well? As usual, John Boorman's direction is first rate. The film is suspenseful and moves at a break neck pace. Its a little slow at the beginning, but once they get to the river the tension never lets up. The acting is quite impressive also. Jon Voight and Ned Beatty are quite good, but Burt Renyolds is fantastic. This is easily his best performance along with Boogie Nights. Its a shame the man didn't win an Oscar for his work in either films. The hillbillies are completely convincing, perhaps a little too much. Deliverance is one of the finest films from a radical period of film-making. Only in the 70s would a major studio release such a disturbing, complex, and adult motion picture like Deliverance and have it become a success. Also check out James Dickey's novel which further develops the themes.

He stood on a corner of the stage looking every bit the part of the Aintry Sheriff he plays in the movie. His insight into the depth and breadth of the novel Deliverance made my first viewing a memorable one. Every time I see this film, I get chills down my spine. The sheer terror, and total believability of the situation that the four men find themselves in makes for scary moments. In spite of the cuts and edits the film has suffered in the intervening years, the movie still stands as a great action epic, set amidst the raw splendor of a raging river, a backward people and a dying landscape. Anybody interested in pursuing additional information about Appalachia should read Night Comes to the Cumberlands. I highly recommend this film for adults, as some scenes would be disturbing to young children.

I've also read many of the comments on this site. Most of the comments are good and valid...the struggle of man against nature... the macho vs the reflective... but I didn't see one comment on what I think to be the most compelling aspect of this wonderful movie. That is, I think it is one of the best who done-it plots of all time. The fact that we never really know whether or not the four city slickers were being pursued from the start or whether or not Voight shot the wrong guy or not... But there are clues. Like the shot of three guys in the woods when the trip set out up river, when there were only two guys that followed them in the truck. At first we think it is the same guys that agreed to drive the cars. But where did the third come from? Were they even the same guys or some others? And why did the sheriff ask Voight if the two guys who agreed to drive the cars had a third with them? Did he suspect something about three crazed buggers haunting those parts? Or did he suspect that the missing brother-in-law may have been with them? And other minor clues... The guy that Voight shot on the top of the gorge had a wedding ring that the directors were key to focus on. Brother-in-law of the guy in Aintry as he suggested? Also, there aren't many bridges in that neck of the woods. The rape scene was on the right bank. Voight shot the second victim on the left bank. Careless or meaningless direction? I don't think so. Not from Boorman. But do I know what it all means? Hell no, but it is worth buying the DVD and doing a closer study. I think there is an answer in there somewhere. But if anyone else has it figured out, please let me know. Fascinating.

I think it is all about crimes against nature, as well as a think-piece concerning the dichotomy of man's uneasy coexistence with nature. Destroying a picturesque river setting by flooding it to create a man-made dam; spearing fish with a modified high-power bow/arrow; using the river's naturally-formed rapids for a week-end adventure with little appreciation for the natural surroundings or the people who live there, etc. Let us not fail to add forced homosexual rape by sodomy; killing others with impunity; man's attempted ability to manipulate reality by telling mutually-agreed false stories - vs- nature's ability to reveal only facts. There are so many more such references that can be similarly drawn. I think that is the theme James Dickey was working with. Combine the effective picturesque prose of Dickey's novel with Boorman's vividly beautiful filming of the story and the result is a memorable film; probably more appreciated by history than it was when the film was initially released. I would agree the acting is fine, yet may be the weakest part of the final product. Nonetheless, this is a fine film - one of my favorites.

Their plan is to canoe to a town over a couple of days, then pick up their cars at journeys end. Things don't turn out how they'd expected, however. This is an eerily unsettling movie, with a number of threatening hillbilly types lending a sense of dread. The 'city boys' initially encounter some very backwards yokals just before the start of the trip, a mutated child playing banjo being one of the film's early highlights. Once the trip gets under way we are treated to some dazzling cinematography, with beautiful shots of the river and surrounding vegetation, all captured nicely in widescreen. The first stages of the film set the scene really the locals are clearly odd, but matters deteriorate for the canoe party as the film approaches its mid-section, when Jon Voight and his pal are put into a horrifying situation by a pair of riverbank retards. Murder soon follows as their friends rescue them from this disgusting encounter. What now? they all ask. Burial of the corpse and the continuance of the trip are agreed, but the nightmare is far from over...The film continues in the same vein, with plenty of tension and suspicion. A great film. What does make it slightly laughable, though, is the attire of Burt Reynolds. He looks like some kind of camp diver. His clothing is truly bizarre, even for the 70s! His hair also looks as though its been painted on!

The basic premise has been copied to death by weaker films, and everyone who sees it remembers Ned Beatty squealing like a pig.I won't rehash the plot, since it is so familiar, but I'd like to point out a few highlights. This film obviously wishes to point out what a previous reviewer mentioned about there being a big difference between having an appreciation for nature and being able to deal with it. Burt Reynold's character was by far the best equipt of the four main guys and he still got the crap beat out of him by the river. I think that his speech about them leaving the body of the hillbilly behind was the most impressive dramatic point of his up and down career. I love that scene!This film also goes to great lengths to show the difference between city folk and country folk. No matter what part of the country you live in, the biggest difference between people I have ever seen is the one between rural and urban types. Here in Nebraska, you have two main groups Those of us who live in Lincoln or Omaha and.....the rest. It may be unfortunate that these differences exist, but they really do!I like this film because it makes you really think about what you would do if you were in the main characters' shoes. My gut reaction was that Reynolds had the right idea by convincing them not to go to the cops. It seems like this film is setting Ronny Cox up to be the wimp when he insists they tell the cops about the rape/murder incident. But, when they let his dead body go for the last time, I think it was Voigt's character who says he was the best of us.Anyway, this is a very good film. Not everyone will be impressed, but such is life. This film has great music, creepy hillbillies, white water rafting, a quick glimpse of a cottonmouth snake, people getting shot with arrows, and much more.

This is a truly effective voyeur film, a film in which there are actually 5 people traveling down the river, the 4 characters and the viewer.  Notice that all scenes involve the four characters, you are never away from them.  John Boorman, who has given us such great films as Beyond Rangoon and The Emerald Forest provides us with a story of multiple layers and messages, most importantly is As you sow, so shall you reap in which those who rape the wilderness (the four adventurers and their way of life) are themselves raped and find the price of such rape is high indeed, in lives, in guilt. Boorman's direction is highly effective, using the voyeur technique with a high degree of dexterity, perhaps the best it has ever been used.  A case in point is the lack of music in many parts.  Since Psycho it has become tradition to use music to lead the audience into feeling a certain way. Boorman, however, leaves the music behind and allows the viewer to decide how he/she should feel.  Note amount of vocal silence?  It allows the viewer to contemplate what has transpired so far. He also sets up the villains nicely by giving a stereotypical concept a breath of life by introducing us to the inbred, backwoods folk, but never letting us get to know them or their way of life.  He uses several effective visuals at the beginning of the film (especially the old lady watching over the deformed girl) and the Dueling Banjos scene typifies the people of the land, simple, none-too-bright, and living in a world separate from our own.  As to acting, this is probably Jon Voight's best job, and Reynolds is held well in check. On a scale of 1-10, I rate this a good solid 9.

It is a turbulent, disturbing story in which man stands at the crossroads of civilization and nature in all their respective speciousness and wildness.  Man by his very nature hominizes his world, but he can never totally control his environment.

Each character of the four represents one person asa whole with conflicting personalities. Reynolds is the adventurer who refuses to get caught in the downcycle when the system fails. He is a nature man and knows how to survive. Cox is the idealist who is the one with a conscious. Beatty is the stubborn one and Voight is very similar to Cox. The town they go to is very backwoods and filled with trashy locals. One of the most popular cinematic scenes involves an albino boy plucking on the banjo and Cox accompanying him on guitar. That metaphor in itself provides the terms of the movie. They go out on the river and everything is going fine until Voight and Beatty are alone in the woods and come across some threatening hillbillies. The rednecks rape Beatty and Reynolds comes to the rescue by shooting the rapist with a bow and arrow. They take care of the body and face the hardships of nature. Soon Cox is shot and killed by the other redneck and Reynolds gets injured by the river. The canoeing scenes are breathtaking. Go and see this disturbing movie if you enjoy action or adventure.

I always thought that Mr. Boorman was among the best filmmakers ever - him, David Cronenberg and John Frankenheimer. Sadly, none of these three ever won an Academy Award. I read the novel by James Dickey, which I think is a more suitable vehicle for such a powerful story of man versus nature, in a sense that the author uses the advantage of not being limited to budget or time constriction. In paper, Deliverance is even more gripping than the movie, and you get to know what happens for the surviving members of the adventure once they come back to civilization. I remember Dickey's prose, describing the Jon Voight character in the novel, coming back to civilization after the ordeal, the buildings gradually appearing, the mountains behind, but the river, although far, perennial and now a part of himself. Some of the best poetic things about the novel couldn't be translated to the film, but this 1972 movie stood the test of time. It builds atmosphere, and it is a testament for the quality of the writing and the direction, that even with not much happening, the film is breathtaking and tense, and when tragedy strikes, it's a roller-coaster. I recommend this one.

Eventually, they begin their journey, but a horrific, unexpected event leaves them with a body to hide, shed-loads of guilt/disgust/pain to try and shut away and a long, arduous journey down the rocky river back to the brink of sanity. It's intense, disturbing and heart-pounding for a long duration of the film, but the real horror comes from the pre-insanity section of the film, where the character's isolation from familiar forms of humanity and clear lack of enthusiasm or knowledge of how to canoe down an incredibly wild river in an unknown land is truly unsettling. I didn't quite believe one or two scenes (Jon Voight's sudden and near impossible rock climb) and the pacing was a bit too messy but overall this is an incredible experience. Looks beautiful, brilliant performances and I've already said this once, but is absolutely shocking and disturbing to this day.

By the same director as Excalibur and Emerald Forest, Deliverance concerns four city-slicker types who decide to take a canoe trip down a river which is going to be flooded in order to pave the way for the construction of a dam. The city-slickers believe it will be the last time they will be able to experience the river as nature intended. They foresee the trip as simply a weekend of white water rafting, fishing, camping, and becoming one with their natural surroundings. Their experience eventually becomes an ordeal of survival and moral dilemma.Their first stop by car before they head to the river foreshadow some of the events which will follow. To get gas and ask for assistance, our four travelers stop at a village (I hesitate to call it even a town) made of shacks and broken-down cars. They get gas and ask the locals to drive their cars to the end of the river so they won't have to walk back the many miles from their departure point. Drew (Ronnie Cox), the one musician among the group, engages a youngster in a famous scene in which they play Dueling Banjos, which brought back this memorable instrumental blue-grass riff originally written in the 1950's. (It topped the charts as a result of the film.) After the piece is finished, Drew attempts to shake hands with the youngster who seems disturbingly aloof and almost not quite aware of the strangers in his midst. We then notice the other locals acting funny toward them. They are even warned not to go the river. Of course, we know right off they should have listened.The vacationers finally make it to the river and begin their journey. At first they engage in what seems nothing more than a scenic ride along the rapids with Lewis (Burt Reynolds) using his modern bow and arrow to snag game fish. They set up camp at night. But the next day, their journey escalates into something far more sinister and life-threatening, involving sexual assault and murder. The story twists into an ordeal in which we learn how each character deals with the dramatic, traumatic and tragic circumstances which become their experience. The journey is a flight into an entirely new world of existence.What makes Deliverance compelling is not simply the circumstances faced by the characters, but how the characters in turn deal with their situation. Each actor is right on the money, living in the skin of their characters, including Jon Voigt as Ed who seems ill-at-ease with hunting and rafting, Ned Beatty as Bobby nicknamed Chubby as the salesman who seems like a fish out of water, Ronnie Cox as Drew the musician but the most unstable of the group, and particularly Burt Reynolds as Lewis, the unofficial leader of the group who seems the most at-home. Later, Lewis is forced to relinquish his decision-making power and must put his life into the hands of his less-experienced colleagues.A film which is not for all tastes but makes you think, much in the way Pulp Fiction does. After the premier of Pulp Fiction, Tarantino said that not all audiences necessarily liked it, but they came away discussing it. I think Delieverance has much of the same impact. While this is not escapist entertainment, it is a film which will challenge your perceptions about survival versus law. Overall not to be missed if you're up for a challenge. But if your favorite movie is the Sound of Music or Lassie, you may want to pass on it.

But this was also an age of questioning and uncertainty, and the wilderness could also be turned into a place of terror and mystery. This mixture of yearning and fear provides the backdrop for 1972 thriller Deliverance.Deliverance was the breakthrough movie for English director John Boorman. Boorman's earliest pictures had been very overtly stylised, with lots of zooms and rapid editing. For Deliverance he has a more subtle approach, but still with that strong sense of rhythm and atmosphere. Of especial note in Deliverance is his use of space on the river. Every shot shows a tight bend or is part obscured by the trees &#x96; we never really get a look at the way ahead. This is not an Aguirre/Apocalypse Now vision of the river as a road wending its way through the forest. This is the river as a maze where every part looks the same and there doesn't seem to be any way out. This greatly helps to fuel the sense of confusion and paranoia that permeates the whole thing. But Boorman further remembers to keep this a human drama, staging a lot of the action in close-up with the background an unfocused blur.This is all the better to capture some fine acting. Burt Reynolds is, at first glance, simply a macho poser, albeit a very charismatic one. But there is more going on in his performance, with hints of disturbing capabilities just below the surface. Ned Beatty impresses in his first screen role, allowing himself to be totally humiliated and still appearing believable in his reactions. On the downside Ronny Cox is hammy and Jon Voigt is a little overwrought. Towards the end there's a neat cameo by source novel author James Hickey, giving an understated but menacing turn as the local sheriff.Like so many pictures of this era, Deliverance states its themes boldly. There is the conflict between progress and rural simplicity, and the need for men to prove themselves in an age where technology has made everything easy and comfortable. Such statements seem a little trite, but in the case of Deliverance they are forgivable because they are presented in such a taut, compelling thriller, with layers of ambiguity that are cunning yet never convoluted, and certainly never pretentious. It is neither as grandiose or other-worldly as Heart of Darkness or its many adaptations (including Apocalypse Now), but is instead close, gritty and uncomfortably lifelike, even when at its most nightmarish.

Some are destined to make it into a groundbreaking classic, some are destined to pass it of as a one-dimensional exploitation picture, but really it's neither.

And Deliverance is about this fight, in three rounds, ending with a split decision.The first round is won by men, those politicians and businessmen who decided to terminate a natural setting for improving the lives of some bourgeois citizens. A beautiful river condemned to become a common lake, for no other specific reason than to assess the almighty power of men on the face of the Earth. This project scandalizes Lewis, Burt Reynolds, who takes his friends to a last canoe ride, to celebrate the swan song of a natural setting. A setting raped by men, but that these men will try to honor with respect, like three civilized men. But this is nature, not civilization, and nature is about survival and doesn't give a damn about respect, honor, or dignity. And the natural setting will become their hellish nightmare, and if men rape nature symbolically, unfortunately, nature doesn't give a damn about symbols &#x85;Lewis, is the one who enthusiastically embraces the call of the wild, like a fish in water, and the same can't be said for Bobby, Drew and Ed, Ned Beatty, Ronny Cox and Jon Voight as the straight men of a tragicomedy where nature has the good laughs and where Bobby will pay the most humiliating price. These men are so normal, so indeed civilized, that we do feel they will have to face a natural adversary incarnated by this wild river. And the iconic beauty of that film is that nature will be incarnated in its most savage and bestial way, through a population that lived in a world so closed, that it inspired the lowest instincts, starting by the most blasphemous one incest.It's not surprising that the movie indirectly features incest in its first scene through the unforgettable hybrid hillbilly who plays one of the most memorable cinematic instrumental duets ever &#x85; The 'Duelling Banjos' still resonate in my mind as the hymn announcing a coming battle of men against the elements, against God, nature, give it a name &#x85; but the scene is so cheerful, so full of joy and energy that you forget its most important aspect a warning, a warning about a population where common laws are not respected; after all, isn't the incest, the cardinal sin on which the whole human civilization was based? The first setting is obviously made of doors that open the gates to hell, a hell where there's no God, no rules, except the one of the strongest.And this is how the D of Deliverance became the epitome of cinematic Disturbingness, because it depicted one of the most difficult scenes to watch but still extremely eloquent about the &#x85; ways, bestiality choose to assert its power. The way these hillbillies acted had nothing to do with sexuality, it's a rape yes, but more a disgusting affirmation of power that puts men at the same level of animals, even lower. Animals prove their power by the same act, the hillbilly did, and it's not a coincidence that he wanted him to imitate the sound of an animal during that moment. Nothing sexual, no fantasies, living like an animal is acting like one, and the only way to get rid of this scum, was to ruthlessly kill him. Natural selection, an eye for an eye. At the end of the second round, it's a tie.And to understand the beauty of civilization is to understand its weakness. Despite all the pain, Ed and especially Bobby went through; they were still debating about the gravity of killing. Ed, who couldn't kill a deer, climbed a dangerous cliff to kill the bad guy, but still couldn't shoot him at the crucial moment. Because 'an eye for an eye' is still nature talking and the law is here not to comfort this nature, but to correct it. Lewis asks if someone knows about the laws, this is an important scene, because it means that for these men, killing still means going against their nature, they have to respect some rules and act only in self defense. Nature affects their acts but not their reactions.It's a pity that the film is only remembered as the one which features a male rape. This rape is not gratuitous, it's a powerful and meaningful scene that illustrates our whole fears, as civilized men meeting nature in its cruelest and less empathetic form. And this is why Deliverance is one of the greatest thrillers ever produced by the 'New Hollywood' wave (no pun intended), because it explores one of our deepest fears  being men in a hostile environment that wouldn't even care if you were a hopeless child, and encountering the nightmarish incarnations of soulless humans. Deliverance warns about the death of nature, but also the death of humanity. Both are in danger, and both help each other. Men can still respect nature and win over the elements, and nature can inspire men some instincts that save them in extreme situations. Not a pessimistic film, and what a thriller! And more than a thriller, Deliverance is just one of the 'great films'. I don't necessarily know what a great movie is, but if I consider Howard Hawks' definition  it's a great film if you can think of three good scenes and no bad ones &#x85; well, we have the mountain climbing, the disturbing squealing like a pig scene, unforgettable, and the sumptuous and exciting 'Duelling Banjos'. The sound of the banjos that immortalized the symbiosis of men in nature and nature in men. Because the relationship between these two fighters can also be made of male camaraderie, and a complementarity that leads from hell to deliverance.

The only thing I could remember about the film were two scenes one involving a duel between an inbred kid on a banjo and a guy with a guitar, and the other you can guess. I knew the film was considered to be a classic by many, but I was interested to see whether it held up at all in the light of modern cinema.It does, and then some.This is astonishing, ahead-of-its-time film-making and quite possibly the first man vs. nature movie. Since then, our screens have been deluged with endless backpackers/hikers/teenagers on a camping trip get lost in the woods with psycho rednecks for company-type movies, but DELIVERANCE is, as far as I know, the first and best of this cycle (although there are many other low budget gems, like the 1977 film RITUALS).The movie begins deceptively ordinary, with a group of guys going on a canoeing weekend and bantering together. Not a great deal happens until the infamous, still shocking sequence, which is all about power and degradation and still leaves a deeply unpleasant impact on the unassuming viewer. From this second in, the tension is riveted up and the film becomes chilling, disturbing, and to my mind, utterly frightening. As director, Boorman is at the peak of his game, shooting his rugged locales with an expertly eerie eye and making excellent decisions during the storytelling (I loved the uncertainty surrounding the fate of a central character).Four well-known actors were picked for the film and boy, do they give fine turns. Burt Reynolds is the typical stock macho guy he's well known for playing, but he gives him warmth and a likability that shines through despite his hard-ass, egotistical behaviour. Ned Beatty starts out as a rather unlikeable chap, but our opinion of him changes once he undergoes a terrible ordeal and he becomes the most sympathetic in the film. Ronny Cox (best known as the bad guy from ROBOCOP) is the straight, out of his element guy, and Jon Voight is the film's hero &#x96; a man who must delve inside himself to rediscover his primal instincts.The film is superbly shot throughout, the sense of menace is overwhelming, the plot is thoroughly engaging and the twists and turns always surprising. The ending is full of a different type of suspense and doesn't disappoint either, while Voight gives what I consider to be his best turn as the ordinary guy who becomes a hero.

And the story went on. It's difficult not to associate Duelling Banjo with Deliverance, really they belong to each other and complete each other's. I'm rather surprised that I think a lot of this work. I usually don't think much of violence for the sake of violence. But as the years piled up on my shoulders I came to realise that there are a lot of things one does not really like but many of them are just like the weather, whether or not you like it, it's just part of reality and you've got to sail with it. So it's fair for movie makers to serve it. Again, about violence I don't think any era, locality, or human group has a particular claim on it. It's always been part of our lot. Sometimes we are violent for a cause, sometimes because we don't have a cause and at other times it just same to happen. In Deliverance it seemed to have happen as a kind of claim - when some of our four protagonists inadvertently find themselves in someone else feudal territory... and there are people who are wishing for the day they can become an all mighty land lord. Deliverance delivers it in a unique way and fairly unique surrounding too. If you've never seen it enjoy or suffer the ride.

A few of the events occur in a way that leaves you unsure of what has really happened. For example, we are never positive on what led to Drew's strange behavior while on the canoe and his subsequent death. One of the men says that he saw the toothless man up on the hill, but none of the other men saw him and no gunshot was heard. When they find Drew's body, there is no clear gunshot wound. Another example is when Ed shoots the man with his bow, assuming that it was the same toothless man they had encountered the day before. When he looks at the man's face he is unsure whether it is the same man, and Bobby also expresses that he is uncertain as to whom Ed had killed.I liked that there were some elements of the film that were left open-ended.

I've still never gotten around to reading it, but the film itself is one of the most powerful pieces of modern film making in the history of cinema.Leaving the book on the back burner, 'Deliverance' is a movie in which a group of men find out what they're made of. The primal urge to get away from city life and, join nature at its most coherent level, ultimately ends up being their worst nightmare. The very thing they were trying to get away from confronts them right in the place where it was never supposed to happen.Not only does the film commentate on risky subjects such as homosexuality, bestiality, and rape, it actually entwines the three into one big ball of shock. A film on survival, will, determination, trials, tribulations - and the heart it takes to overcome them all. Some groundbreaking movie making - not only with the location and casting, but with the true depiction of deep backwoods types.The banjo scene goes down in history as one of the most memorable. Ronnie Cox and the 'banjo boy' playing 'Dueling Banjos' is probably one of the most sketched scenes ever.Aside from being groundbreaking on a number of different levels, the modern backwoods slasher film owes a helluva lot to 'Deilverance'. Such films as 'The Final Terror '83', feature a backwoods killer in a remote area alongside a river. The Canadian film 'Rituals', also owes a lot to 'Deliverance'- as a trip in the woods goes horribly wrong for a group of hunters. 'Deliverance' set the stage for a number of cash-ins that still ride its coat tails until this day.In a nutshell, 'Deliverance' 'delivers' - and it delivers big, "},{"Title":"So good it hurts","Date":"9 February 2007","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Thriller","Review":" Impactful film of four city slickers in crisis in Appalachia has become synonymous with rural depravity.

I managed to rationalize the horror of other films -- after Jaws I reasoned that sharks could endanger people only if they enter the water and only at certain ocean beaches; and after Saving Private Ryan I decided that WWII ended long ago and that the armed forces didn't recruit people my age anyway -- but I couldn't think myself through the depression I experienced for 2-3 days following the night I watched Deliverance.The poverty of the people living above the Cahulawassee River, the hostility of some of them towards outsiders, their overall social and emotional limitations, as underscored by the banjo playing boy's autistic-like detachment as he looked down at the canoeists from a foot bridge, had me unnerved before the real adventure began. Looking back, I not only owed my fear to a well written story, but also to a wisely chosen and ably directed cast.Burt Reynolds did a very believable job in his portrayal of Lewis Medlock, the lone physical, backwoods smart, outdoors man of the foursome. With his self-assertive personality and confrontational style, Medlock seemed to know that a show of vulnerability does not gain respect from a mountain man. He aroused my anxiety in the process, however, because I couldn't imagine myself approaching those people in the same way.I saw myself much more in the other three men, Bobby Trippe, Drew Ballinger (Ned Beatty and Ronnie Cox), and especially Ed Gentry, Jon Voight's character. In fact, I identified so much with them, as they dealt with their fear by attempting to ingratiate themselves with the utterly unsophisticated people they encountered in the Appalachian wilderness, that I felt personally very threatened when Ballinger's, Trippe's, and Gentry's patronizing behavior seemed to work against them.

They only became violent to protect their families or to have a friendly fisticuffs with a rowdy full of moonshine. Deliverance showed rural America differently, rather than mean streets there were mean dirt roads and cold-blooded killers. Deformities brought on my poor diets and such taboos as incest practiced for generations led to a perversion of the entire community. In reality neither stereotype is correct. But that's the way the big screen depicted it. What caused the change? Possibly the permissive sixties and the national trauma of the Vietnam War. The four main characters of Deliverance each has a story to tell. There's the amoral adventurer who likes to kill for sport giving Burt Reynolds has best screen role. Reynolds makes the most of it and does a magnificent job. Too bad dry rot set in almost immediately with Reynolds making some very bad career decisions. Though he made a lot of money in such popular films as Smokey and the Bandit, his artistic potential was squandered. Then there's the sensitive poet musician played by Ronny Cox. His world is composed of sweetness and light. There's no room for imperfections, certainly not for evil. Ned Beatty shows his amazing screen talent for the first time as the obnoxious good ol' boy who's more at home in a cocktail bar than in the primeval forest. Jon Voight, who had a few years earlier been nominated for an Academy Award for Midnight Cowboy, plays the most complex character of the four. He's a wannabe but what does he want to be? He seems to emulate Lewis (Burt Reynolds) yet at the same time not wanting to be like him. This ambivalent attitude is further twisted by his hesitant attempt to kill, first a deer then a man. He also tends to be the actual leader of the men rather than Lewis, who seeks that position but doesn't have the leadership qualities necessary. All four men journey into the wilderness to canoe down the Cahulawassee River believing that this last vestige of the frontier before the dam waters cover it is a personal paradise far from the madding crowd of the big city. Soon the trip turns into a nightmare. The paradise becomes at best purgatory.The music adds so much to the film yet in reality it's just one song--although Drew (Ronny cox) does sing an old folk song in camp the first night. Dueling Banjos, originally Feuding Banjos, has just the right tempo and pitch to highlight the events of the movie. It starts off slowly, builds to a fast dance-type melody, then ends at a feverish lope, so fast the music seems to run away with itself. A bluegrass revival (if that's the right word since bluegrass was never a mainstream art form) was taking place in the United States due to the popularity of such shows as The Beverly Hillbillies and Bonnie and Clyde, both featuring the fabulous bluegrass team of Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs. Virtuoso banjo picker Scruggs had almost single handedly revolutionized banjo playing with his own tuning methods. He had also written several songs especially for the instrument. Eric Weissberg took an old banjo piece from 1955 called Feuding Banjos recorded by Don Reno and Arthur Guitar Boogie Smith (later changed to Dueling Banjos by the Dillards)and played it for Lonnie (Billy Redden) and Drew (Ronny Cox) in the film. Today it is possibly better known than Scruggs' Foggy Mountain Breakdown.The first half of Deliverance seems to crest when the brutal sadistic rape scene occurs. Following that horrendous part, the film slows down somewhat and becomes a bit disjointed. There are a few memorable images during the second half, the confrontation with the hunter on the mountain top, the dining interaction when Bobby (Ned Beatty) breaks the ice by declaring, this corn is special, the car pulling over so the church could pass, moving the graves, and the terror of the hand, but this is still the least satisfying piece of the movie. Director John Boorman had arguably already done his best work with Point Blank, a still under-appreciated cinematic creation. But Deliverance is certainly one of his triumphs. James Dickey did a commendable job adapting his book to film. His acting adds a bit of authenticity to the goings on, unlike Ken Kesey who refused to have anything to do with the screen version of One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.Though not without its flaws, this is one of my favorite flicks from the 1970's. In its own way it helps define that rather confused decade. "},{"Title":"A Potent Portrait Of Man In Extremis. Highly Recommended.","Date":"1 February 2006","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Thriller","Review":" A potent film. Four characters are developed, subtly and succinctly, and then, just as deftly, pushed over the edge. They set out to experience the wilderness of the Cahulawassee River and find it both wonderful and dangerously wild.Patient cinematography captures the river's beauty, isolation, and, later, its ominous force. Crisp, unhurried, often stationary shots let the Cahulawassee's rapids speak for themselves, but equally let the threat of the river's silent stretches resonate.The burbling, roaring, quiet water is this film's soundtrack. This lack, by and large, of extra-diagetic music perfectly suits the material; the audience never gets to experience everyday movieland. The one exception to this rule is the 'Duelling Banjos' theme, which, while initially forming part of the story, later echoes down the river to great effect.The song, as first exchanged between one of the canoers and an autistic hillbilly, is a deservedly famous showstopper. However, this film is far more than a song.The thrill and terror of exploration; the disappearance of wilderness; the light and dark sides of both nature and man; loyalty; faith in others and in society; democracy; the morality of killing; the clash of urban and rural culture; prejudice; notions of justice; the capacities of man in extremis; the consequences of secrecy; man 'after the fall' &#150; this film touches upon many complex and powerful themes, yet this richness is rarely conspicuous and never belaboured.Performances are universally excellent. John Voight's understated showing hypnotises looking into to his eyes we experience the film's trials, and on the other side we feel changed as he feels changed. Burt Reynolds and Ned Beatty are also convincing in their more exuberant roles. The secondary characters that populate Deliverance strikingly transport the film to the edge of civilisation. The lingering peep-show shots of Lewis's search for a driver are a disturbing portent.Highly Recommended.

Deliverance should be applauded for its audacity and the will to not conform to any standard studio template of its time. The action flows with the river.

I guess that is the beauty of the film though, that we're right there with them; seeing everything through their eyes. We know as much (or as little) as they do and therefore never really learn the truth about anything.We never really discover whether their actions in this movie were right or wrong but that's the whole point, the question of whether they deserve 'deliverance' from their sins is left open for the characters in the film and us, the viewers, to ponder and decide.I don't want to give too much away but this is a film that deals with serious thought-provoking issues including rape, murder, death, sins, the law and morality and really lays such important issues down and questions them. It's an raw and intense roller-coaster and I can definitely see where films like 'Wrong Turn' got their influence from.This movie is an absolute must-see, it's gritty, realistic and intense and shows just how easily sheer bliss can turn into sheer hell whilst questioning morality, conscience, human nature and the society we live in along the way.

The much-heralded Duel Banjo scene is a spectacular and unnerving start to the film- Ronny Cox's character, whilst waiting in a desolate gas station strums up his guitar with a strange-looking inbred child playing on his banjo.  The scene that follows is as brilliant as it is disturbing and the music becomes a soundtrack for the rest of the film.The four canoeists (Reynolds, Voight, Beatty, Cox) trip down the River (soon to be flooded by a huge lake- a very neat twist from writer Dickey) doesn't become a trip to survive nature as one assumes it will be, but a fight for survival from fellow men. And what men!!! The nemesis of  the canoists turns out to be a duo of inbred hillbillies (rotting teeth et al). Making the hillbillies the villans is a terrifying touch-  their faces contorted in ugliness, with seemingly no sense of morals and humanity.   The most uncomfortable scene of the film is the male-rape scene (Squeel like a piggy!)- but don't let it put you off seeing the movie.It's not flawless, however.  The film makes very uncomfortable viewing (and essentially unsatisfying) and you never feel a real attachment with the protaganists but if you like your movies with a bit of originality and horror this is the one for you...Reynolds puts in one of his better perfomances and Jon Voight (father of Angelina Jolie) acts in what probably is his best performance to date.  Boormans direction is sound, and this is undoubtably one of his best movies.The film turns into an apocalyptic struggle for the canoeists, and Boorman creates a nightmarish hell that will play upon your mind for days to come- and put you off canoeing for life...8/10 "},{"Title":"Underrated classic of 70s.

Echoing the great American novel Huck Finn they attempt to tame a treacherous stretch of the Mississippi before it is dammed by constructors and the naturalist theme of man not knowing or respecting his environment enough which rings through that book is seen here too, sometimes disturbingly. From the moment Burt Reynolds crashes a jeep recklessly through the woods trying to find the launch point by instinct having thrown away their map, one can tell that these men have no idea what awaits them. Reynolds is (for once) excellent as the archetypal alpha-male who leads his timid friends into the breach but is crippled by the river. Better still is Voight though, who finds it in himself to take another man's life; clearly the thinker amongst the group, his transition to cold blooded killer is utterly convincing to watch; the point, that we all still have our natural instincts within us but they are suppressed by our sanitized everyday lives, is well made. This transition is speeded by seeing his friend raped by bandits - again signifying how unnatural the whole episode is and how out of (their) place these boys from the city really are. The relief when they reach the end of their trip and return to civilization is palpable and heightened by how inevitably slow the descent into disaster has been. Indeed the whole film is wonderfully paced. Forget the much parodied banjo scene, this film is a disturbing and well written tale of civilized men going back to nature and discovering that they are neither ready nor willing for its trials.

As Lewis Medlock teases 'what's the point to having insurance...there's no risk.'  This even accentuates the authenticity of the story.This story has two underlying themes a moral one and one concerning urbanisation.  It shows what can happen to normal, moral-minded folk when pressed to the limit of survival.  A weekend away in the wild might bring out the worst in people.  No one is innocent.  This was happening during the cradle of globalisation.  The last of the untouched and obscure country ready to be consumed.  As I was only three years old when the movie came out, I have been looking for that lost obscurity ever since.  No mystery is left.  As Lewis Medlock mentions that we have sold off this Eden for our own cushy lifestyles.  We greedily want both worlds.  We want the comfort of our own homes and families and jobs but still want to escape and fish in the final frontier which we will rapidly flood our development on.  Because of the enemy of modernisation, the natural world that we are destroying is demonstrated by the hillbillies, who wreak their proverbial revenge upon us. This is an analogy of an inevitable cause and effect relationship between the wild and urbanisation.Since this is closely based on the book, it is difficult to determine what is a spoiler and what is not.  I read the book and saw the film twice and think that it's pretty close and no wonder since the author appears in it himself.  The only difference worth noting is that Ed Gentry props himself down in between rocks rather than up in a tree.  He is below his mountain man rather than above.  Makes it a bit scarier.  My favourite part is when Ed Gentry falls from the snapped rope and lands embracing the stiff in the water accompanied by the Seventies psychedelic soundtrack appropo for the time.A typical weekend out with the boys One guy gets raped, one gets killed and two get injured and have to cover up for their crimes in the face of their caregivers.It should have been called Up Your Creek Without a Paddle.

The plan is to conquer the river, to ride it to the bottom, and they are prepared. However, the one element that is unplanned for, that can't be planned for, is the human element.The acting in it is superb, every single character within the movie is completely and utterly believable.  The cinemetography is also great, the scenery is captured and used to help convey the story.  From the time travelling down the calm part of the river where there is no dialogue, to where the very disturbing rape scene occurs, and even towards the end of the movie where Voight has to climb the cliff to find their attackers at the middle of the rapids.That all being said, the most important aspect of the film is the story itslef.  I saw it as a tale of four friends who believe themselves to be a certain way, but are not really sure of themselves until after they are tested.Reynolds makes a statement to Voight early on in the film, that a man does not know what he's made of until he's taking aim. (While referring to hunting a deer).  That little bit of foreshadowing is evident at the end, where John Voight has a clear shot of a man who will no doubt kill them given the opportunity.  Even knowing that he raped Ned Beatty's character and would no doubtedly rape him as well (and presumably kill them both), shot thier friend Ronny Cox's character, he still could not commit murder until absolutely forced.Reynolds comes off as a very strong character, and he maintains that through the film - despite a shattered leg.  Cox is a very light hearted man who has a family and is presumably looked upon as a solid provider, yet when faced with trouble he crumbles to near madness.  Beatty is a somewhat cocky and arrogant person, but when his test comes he withdrawls into himself, and comes out stronger than before.  Voight is the everyman, arrogant rarely and looking inwards at himself.  He also rises to the occasion and even afterwards does not sit well with him.  His nightmares at the end of the movie seem not to be of the man they killed being discovered, but of the friend who did not make it back reaching out to return.I thought the movie was very full of symbolism, and is a Must See for anyone who enjoys some substance in thier films, instead of nothing but technological advances.

Four city-slickers go into the wild for a weekend canoe trip, acting like trail-blazing pioneers courageously exploring a vanishing frontier.  But early in the story, we see evidence that they are way out of their element.  They have entered a place that they can't easily understand or come to terms with, without ever even leaving their own state.  As they look for someone to drive them and their canoes upriver, we see in the background the harsh poverty and backwardness of the mountain folk.  It is as if the four men are in a completely different world where all things new have failed to penetrate and the rules are not the same as in the big city.  Yet, they seem oblivious to it all, and go about their male-bonding by recklessly canoeing down a wild and untame river and drinking large amounts of beer as if they are in some Old Milwaukee commercial.  They have come to conquer the wilderness, much like civilization is infringing upon this forgotten place by damming up the river and flooding the gorge.  But as the trip suddenly goes horribly wrong, the men are forced to reveal what they are really all about inside.  Ned Beatty's frail character is stripped of all his dignity by a mountain man in a very disturbing yet powerful rape scene, and then has to rise off the ground and deal with his shame in it's aftermath.  Burt Reynold's character, a gungho survivalist freak is exposed as actually being weak when he is injured and has to rely on his friends to survive.  Ronny Cox seems doomed from the start as he fails to deal with the situation they all find themselves in.  And The character played by Jon Voight is faced with the morally trying task of killing a man to defend himself when earlier in the film he can't even bring himself to shoot a deer.  The film takes these four macho men and puts them to the test.  Just like in real life, some of the men pass the test, and some of them fail, but what they are really made of on the inside has by the end of the movie replaced what they have tried to say about themselves on the outside.  Machismo is humbled.  I particularly enjoy seeing this because in today's world, so many people, both men and women take unnecessary risks with their lives in order to achieve some ridiculously short-lived thrill.

It can be enjoyed as a simple action adventure with four city dwellers battling for their lives when their weekend trip to the country goes very, very wrong.I suspect, however, that director Boorman was trying to tell us that we live in a jungle and man's inherent nature is evil.The four go on a canoeing trip and it is obvious that their only concerns are about natural perils but we see that the real danger comes both from themselves and other humans.Boorman makes stunning use of symbolic imagery when an extremely ugly hillbilly child plays with Cox in the two banjos sequence. Despite the beauty of the music we sense foreboding in what is to come.The crucial scene comes after Burt Reynolds kills one of the hillbillies to defend his colleagues from homosexual assault. The four debate whether to go to the authorities or cover up the killing. We see a courtroom-like atmosphere develop where what seems to be on trial is the nature of mankind itself. The personalities of each of the group are thrown into sharp contrast Ronny Cox is the humanist - he argues that the group should turn itself in and claim self-defense, firm in the belief that by doing the 'right thing' they will be treated fairly. Ned Beatty's character has tried throughout the film to prove his masculinity - his only concern is that no one should ever know of this episode (which could call his sexuality into question). Jon Voight is the vacillator - he will go with the majority or the strongest voice. He is therefore convinced by the character of Burt Reynolds. Reynolds is the strong silent type with no illusions about what to expect from a jury composed of the relatives of the dead man.In contrast to all the others Reynolds appears completely relaxed and is in his element. In reality, he has waited all his life for this moment. The seriousness with which he has taken this trip and the fact that he learned how to shoot with bow and arrow are no accident. Even before the killing, one never had the impression that the trip was just fun for him. One almost has the feeling that he is a closet survivalist. He has the self-confidence of a jungle native on his own turf and knows at every step from then on in the film what to expect and what to do.Predictably, there is a need for more killing before the survivors can escape. Voight is the hapless 'coward' put in the role of enduring severe physical and emotional ordeals to save the group and himself.When finally, all seems to be over we can not fail to ignore the irony of the 'advice' given by the sheriff (interestingly it appears that this was played by the author of the book and scriptwriter of the film James Dickey) don't ever do anything like this again = I know what you did but I can not prove it. You will not have the same luck if you try again.The group understand exactly what he means. They have learned all they want to about themselves and human nature in general.

It's a harrowing account of what could possibly happen in these kinds of situations. This movie is not only macho guy heroism with vulgarities. It had to be believable and real and it succeeds on all levels of artistic value. James Dickey's novels were about men battling with the wilderness and being forced to test themselves against others and nature. John Boorman's direction raises the stakes by showing the dark side of human nature, revenge, survival and explores the beautiful natural world which can be gentle as well as cruel. Jon Voight, Burt Reynolds, Ronny Cox and Ned Beatty all give admirable performances. John Boorman chose real mountain hillbillies for the minor roles to add authenticity to the environment and uses them with discretion and appropriate subtlety. The duelling banjo sequence is a highlight that serves as a precursor to the horror that thus follows. All guys should watch Deliverance with their girlfriends. Girls can learn a lot from this.

I trajected off of I-95 in Maryland one night recently to avoid the Susquahanna River toll and to use the opportunity to fill up the car at a place where gas is cheap. In the town of Conowingo, I encountered an aggressive driver and wound up involved in a major incident of road rage. I was stalked and harassed but managed to make it to a convenient store and stop within a reasonable amount of time. The driver got out of his car, was threatening and virulent, and approached me. I called the police on my cell phone. The other person involved was so hostile that I couldn't get out of my car and had to spray pepper spray out of a halfway open window.After a few minutes, the guy pulled his car to another side of the store. Things calmed down, and I went into the store to grab a Coke while I waited for the police. Right as I got finished being rung up, the cashier said to another co-worker Here come the calvary. Apparently, everyone in the store knew what was going on.I'm the one who called the cops, but the entire situation turned on me. Another group of people that weren't even involved told the cops that I was driving like a maniac, came up and pointed me out saying This is the crazy guy. I had no idea who these people were. It appeared that some of the townsfolk collaborated and ganged up on me. As I stood there dressed preppy next to my Toyota Camry looking and feeling like an obvious target, the cops searched my car and even asked if I had been drinking. I was even asked to recite the ABCs and count backwards from 59 to 36. Given I had several groups of people mentioning that I was driving insanely, the cop had no choice but to react that way. However, these idiot rednecks had a number of fallacies in their story that undermined their credibility including telling the cops I had a gun. So, fortunately, the cops were rationale enough to realize that their story was fabricated upon finding no gun. They let me go, and I consider myself very lucky. Fortunately, it was state police; things might not have gone so well if it were local law enforcement.My experience heightened the realism that this movie successfully projects.

The basis for the plot line consists of four friends who decide travel down the rapids of the Cahulawassee River before its floodplain is turned into a recreational lake. After passing off their vehicles to a few hillbillies, who promise to deliver them downstream, the company of canoers embark. But the hills that bank the river have eyes, and the intensity of the action that follows this realization is only surpassed by the connection made between the viewer and the film's unexpected protagonist. While most thrillers and action movies in the current era of film seem to feed off of high paced and unrealistic action sequences, Deliverance reels in the viewer through its realism. Its unedited feel and quality acting allow the viewer to empathize with each character as they deal with obstacles as real humans, as opposed to Hollywood heroes, would. Noteworthy is the liberal use of extreme close ups following significant events, as they become a significant means by which relationship is established. It is the ability of each actor to perform during these shots that sets the characterization in Deliverance apart from many other films. The only weakness in the film is Burt Reynolds' character, Lewis, whose overdone macho-man persona doesn't fit with the realistic characters the film so- successfully establishes. This factor is a significant hindrance to the film's goal of overall realism. Still, the value of the film is more noticeable now than ever, as it is a wonderful contrast to what seems to be the norm in the action genre. I would recommend this film to anyone of age who appreciates quality acting and a realistic plot. The moral implications raised by each character's actions also leave significant food for thought.

Set in a very incestuous, back-hoe section of Georgia, the film becomes unsettling as soon as they venture into a small town in search for drivers. The infamous dueling banjo/guitar scene occurs right away, putting it in the forefront of your mind. In this perturbing setting the characters move around easily, stretching out their legs and hamming it up with one another. Though it's masked by the sexual assault and nature vs. man narrative the real theme of the film is the state of manliness and its cousin, machismo. Personified beefcake Burt Reynolds, provides the perspective of pure manliness in the character of Lewis he hunts and fishes with a crossbow, sleeps under a ramshackle homemade tent, sloughs through mansplaining monologues about his intrepid wanderings in the wilderness, and revels in his absurd testosterone fueled opinions on manhood. The other three are there to watch him boast and bray, themselves trying to find their manliness amongst the rushing rapids of the river. The story concerns the four men, but it's really the story of Ed (Voigt), who fails to live up to Lewis' expectations he can't hunt, can't protect himself and Bobby (Beatty), doesn't argue with Louis, and can't save Drew (Cox) from the river's wrath. Near the end of the film he is tasked with defending them and this time he succeeds, to his detriment. Everything serves as a metaphor in this film, including, unfortunately, the infamous piggy scene. Beatty is the only one of the four to eschew traditional roles of masculinity, and so he is the one who is victimized. Near the end of the film we think that this film has been about hillbillies threatening four men on the river, and when the second murder occurs it seems obvious that everything has been righted for our heroes. In fact, it serves as another metaphor, which shows that relying on animalism for decision-making incurs violent, and deadly, repercussions. The ending of the film dragged far too long, as this message is waylaid in order for guilt to be shifted between the remaining members of the troupe, belying the point of the rest of the film. Otherwise this was a thoughtfully crafted film about the role of manhood and how it denigrates men, making them murderous brutes.

Its central thematic concern is the changing relationship between the urban American and the wilderness. Deliverance smartly makes its protagonists Southern urbanites to mitigate the kind of cultural biases that a story about murderous hillbillies calls up, although it's still not exactly a positive portrayal of the Appalachians community. As much as our quartet of hikers profess a love of nature, their relationship with the interior is profoundly antagonistic, a mixture of antagonism and a desire to conquest. Their interaction with the locals is a synecdoche of the larger geological transformation hanging over the whole film the destruction of a complex wilderness to meet the water needs of growing cities.What's so refreshing about Deliverance is that it flatters absolutely no one. Burt Reynolds plays a primitivist alpha male, a role he would spend the next couple decades misinterpreting, and while his steely nihilism is attractive at first he is ultimately rendered useless. Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox are buffoons of entirely different stripes. Jon Voight plays a civilized man whose descent into savagery is never made heroic. Despite being famous for a scene of violence, Deliverance never revels in its depravity in the same way that some of its contemporaries do. These characters have some surprisingly philosophical debates, debates that are ultimately rendered meaningless as they scramble for pure survival. And as for the much-vaunted interior, it's represented by a pair of rapacious monsters who are just as intent on reducing people to animals as the city-dwellers are.John Boorman is a competent director but has trouble livening up the scenes that take place outside of the main action. The opening dueling banjos scene is brilliant, and basically sums up the entire film, but the initial rafting and camping is a slog and the epilogue stretches on too long. The lack of strong direction stops Deliverance from really being among the elite of the New Hollywood films, but it's a respectable entry into that tradition nevertheless. In terms of both its politics and its art, Deliverance captures a moment in time that was already vanishing, and does so in vivid and unforgettable fashion.

The 1972 John Boorman film Deliverance was one of them, a horrifically interesting film.Four friends, Lewis (Burt Reynolds), Ed (Jon Voight), Bobby (Ned Beatty) and Drew (Ronny Cox) go to the remote wilderness of the Deep South to canoe down the Cahulawassee River before it flooded by the construction of a dam. But in the sticks the men meet very hostile hillbillies, leading to a horrific sexual assault and all four men to explore their dark sides.Deliverance is a very atmospheric film and it is done by the simplicity of Boorman's direction. He uses plenty of long shots and single takes, letting the power of the acting do the talking. Music is kept to a minimum and it adds to the atmosphere as most of the sounds we hear are nature, making you feel like you are in wild forest and it added to the horror when we see the infamous rape scene. It gave the moment even more power.Deliverance has an great cast and all four lead actors give excellent performances as they play some difficult roles and situations. Lewis is a macho man, a survivalist who is the most independently minded and the man who shares the hillbilly view of independent and love of wildness of the area. Ed is someone who ends up having to explore his dark side during their journey and Drew tries to be the conscience and rational of the group. All four end up having a dark bound, knowing what happened in the woods and their relationship had a very Stephen King esque feel to it.Deliverance was made in the early 70s, a time where hostility to the Vietnam War was high but it was unpopular in American culture to criticise it in film or books. Like a lot of good storytelling a story can be used as a way to subvertly talk about a subject through a different and you can see the Vietnam parallels in this film. The group of men are city men who suffer a culture crash and hostility from the locals, going into a hot forest area with an enemy around them as they try to survive in an onslaught and the war atrocities before the suffering the aftermath on the home front.Added to the Vietnam theme there are themes of manhood, the dark side of human nature that inhabits men, especially when they are alone in the woods and far away from civilisation and even a look at the nature of these communities who isolated and hostile to authority. But the film does have a surreal look to the hill folk with all their deformities and go through the old clichés that everyone in the rural Deep South is inbred. Finally there is even a slight environmental message about the destruction of the dam would course to the valley.Deliverance is an interesting film that was well paced and the dark nature was clearly following the hallmarks of cinema for the period. It is certainly worthy viewing.

The fictionally soon-to-be-no-more Cahulawassee river, which was really the Chattooga river, is still intact as a scenic wilderness area, and will remain so for a very long time into the future.

Quickly, in the twinkling of an eye, its survival. This movie takes no prisoners--what you see is what you maybe don't want to see. How you feel is maybe how you don't want to feel. Was it their condescending behavior in the presence of the simple mountain folks that came back to bite them? Perhaps. The adventure the four men were seeking--became a life or death struggle with nature...and another way of life.Perhaps they could have handled nature----but they could not handle those living another way.

Its reputation comes from the fact that the director chose to take the opposite view of how nature was commonly perceived in American cinema. Indeed, many films showed a positive view of it and showcased it as a happy refuge where man could find relief and strength from a stressful civilization. In a way, this is the goal that the four main protagonists in Boorman's film indirectly try to reach. They decide to go down the river in a canoe to go back to their roots and to take advantage of a rural place that is bound to be swallowed up by a dam. At first, Boorman seems to be on their side. The film depicts numerous shots of a gorgeous river and imposing landscapes. Details reinforced by a slow, contemplative rhythm and a discreet editing. Moreover, Drew (Ronny Cox) tries to communicate with a muted peasant through music.But little by little, Boorman reveals to the audience that elements of these beautiful landscapes make nature dangerous and hostile to the four adventurers. One can note down that before the apparition of the two silly peasants, Lewis (Burt Reynolds) had animal instincts in him. After the killing of one of the two men, he chooses to bury the corpse and not to call the police. From this watershed onwards, Boorman manages to create an intense tension that won't subside. On the contrary, it will increase with the other misadventures endured by the four men. None of them will be spared and all of them will keep physical or moral scars from this sad trek. The message conveyed by the filmmaker is clear man must accept society and his return to nature can only damage his personality. A must see film.

This would never and could never happen, even in the dark ages of 1972.Deliverance is a very entertaining ride and packed full of action.

Ned Beatty, Ronny Cox, Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds make for an interesting group of individuals who are hell bent on canoing down the Cahulawassee river and the unfortunate series of events that transpires upon them all. The character development takes some time in enveloping the viewer with a better understanding of each person, but eventually you know these guys like they were your friend. The acting, dialogue is very very real, as close to reality as you can get for Hollywood acting. Reynolds character Lewis was interesting as a guy who comes off very tough but underneath the manly veneer lies a very soft and broken man (I was impressed with his performance!) Jon Voight seems to be the character thats on the spotlight the most, the unfortunate circumstances that seem to find him at every corner really mold and caste him into a different man at the end (his character transition was excellent). Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox really seem like the silly lunkheads that just like to joke around and don't seem to get too awful serious unless they have too, and they did... I really was amazed at Director Boorman's vision of Dickey's novel, very impressed. You cannot go your whole life without watching this film. I give it eight out of ten stars, extremely impressed.

It's an all-time classic. The character played by Ned Beatty undergoes one of the greatest on screen transformations ever portrayed. He is a shallow, almost useless, overweight insurance salesman. He is proud of his ignorance, and yet judges the backwards hicks to be the ignorant ones. When he compliments the old man on his hat, and the old man responds, you don't know nothing', the tone is set. It's true. He really doesn't know nothing'. But one backwoods anal rape later, the man is practically a warrior. His shallow fake bravery is toned down into serious resolve. The old self is forever dead, left in some far off woods, soon to be under hundreds of feet of water. And what of Lewis, our intrepid guide? Lewis is a philosopher/hunter/warrior, and he's just about nuts. Burt Reynolds proved himself as an actor way back in 1972 in this film, completely giving himself in to this wonderful role. Who wouldn't want to have a friend like Lewis if one was to venture into the dangers of a forgotten/soon to be left behind world like the one our hapless travelers find themselves in. This film speaks to us on so many levels. The story feels real. It works as a complete action/adventure, with wonderful cinematography, and deliberate, grinding pacing. It works as a bit of a horror film, with the danger and almost surrealism of the encounter with the vile rednecks who objectify their sow Ned Beatty. But it also works as an art film, using incredible amounts of symbolism to convey truths that go to our very core. I have seen this film at least fifty times, and every time it comes on, I find I have to watch it. You have to watch it quite a few times to even begin to comprehend it. This is one deep movie. This is one well-acted movie. And this is one hell of a story. I gave it a 10 out of 10, and put it in my 10 all time greatest films ever made, along with Schindler's List, Casablanca, Taxi Driver, and Sling Blade, among others. Movies that make you think. Movies that take you beyond having to think. Movies that use a STORY to make their point, without trying to preach to you. If you think you know Deliverance, you might, but again, you might not. It really is that good.

Although with most modern movies, extremely enjoyable as some are, those that really shock you into focus are the strongest, and are the ones that are most critically acclaimed and mostly, stick with you for a life time. I say, proudly, that I am a fan of movies that disturb, not just horror movies, but those that send a vibe laden with foreboding. Movies like Breakdown and The Missing, that send a chill down your spine, making you think holy crap, that could happen to me, and visually entice you, are up there with some of my favorite aspects in a movie. Because I am only 21, I did not grow up with actors like Burt Renyolds, Jon Voight and Ned Beatty, albeit I am familiar with them, I didn't watch them grow and proceed as actors, as opposed to actors now like Shia LaBouf and Justin Long. I must say, after the long hype and witnessing Deliverance for the first time, I was so admired by these veteran actors in a movie made more than 30 years ago, and still lives it's terror up in competition to modern movies. Burt Renyolds plays Lewis, the macho self appointed leader of a group of four friends on a canoe trip down a fictitious river before a dam is made, filling the whole wilderness in water. Renyolds' character is an experienced adventurer, sort of no nonsense, and filled with machismo. Witnessing him portray the tough guy, made me think differently about him as an actor, as i have only seen him as a seedy old guy or an angry politician. The dialog the director provides for his character gives him enough malice to be proved as a strong and even intimidating leader. Ronny Cox and Ned Beatty play as the novice adventurers, Drew and Bob respectively, joining in for the fun of a canoe trip. The actor that i thoroughly enjoyed watching was Jon Voight, once again I have only seen him as an older actor, however, unlike Renyolds, I have quite liked Voight's acting (and i don't regard Anaconda when I say that), for example the national treasure movies. Voight plays Ed, whom, like Lewis, is experienced in adventuring but is seen as a more reserved character, a reluctant hero/ leader and definitely lacks Lewis' machismo. The film basically opens up with the four driving into a small town while asking to find someone to drive their cars to the bottom of the river whilst they canoe the rapids and camp along the riverside. You immediately get a creepy vibe from the hillbilly characters we are introduced to, like the imbred kid who plays the infamous Duelling Banjo's at the start of the film with Ronny Cox's character Drew; and more so the two mountain men in the films pivotal and disturbing rape scene. As with all atmospheric movies, from this moment on, dread and confusion fills the characters as well as the audience and it is here we see the characters take shape and change form. The canoe trip that follows is expertly shot and it is from here the men fight against both human and nature's odds for survival. The film's cinematics do not let up, and I back that comment up with the scene in which Ed fights one of the rapist mountain men with a composite bow. As Ed falls on to one of his arrows and notices his enemy approaching him, cocks his rifle, only to shoot the floor as he falls with an arrow in his neck; was possible the greatest piece of cinematic shooting I have seen in a film. In wrapping up, Deliverance is one film, who's dread and atmosphere carry the mood across and to this date, remains one of the best films in cinematic history.

The day my father left my mother, he took me to see this film with his new girlfriend, on opening day at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood. I was but fourteen years old. I wasn't even entirely sure what I was seeing, but I will never forgot it, especially the scene with Ned Beatty.Watching it today, thirty-six years later, it still gives me quivers.My father was a huge Burt Reynolds fan, hence the reason for standing in line for almost an hour in to watch what was supposed to be an 'action movie.' I had seen two films at the Dome prior to this Grand Prix and The Song of Norway. Well this wasn't exactly Mario Andretti or The Brady Bunch. After leaving the theater, I was shell-shocked.But even at that tender age, I appreciated the artistry...and after seeing again today, am I surprised I was still standing after witnessing this highly disturbing, yet extremely well-crafted film.Suffice it to say it was a traumatic experience for a fourteen year-old that had yet to kiss his first girlfriend. I don't blame my father for taking me, but it was a bit much for a child to witness.As an adult, I still find it quite disturbing, yet I am still very impressed with the quality of the film-making.Burt Reynolds as an absolute wonder, as are all the principles...from Billy Redden as the inbred guitar wonder, to Ronny Cox as the terrified insurance salesman...everyone does an admirable job. The sound quality is second to none, from the chirping birds to the ticking clocks. The photography, cinematography...all the technical aspects of this remarkable film are first rate.The moral questions raised, from murdering the sexual assaulters to the aftermath of dealing with killing a human being, remain as profound today as they did when this groundbreaking film was released. And the classic sequences of attempting to survive in the wilderness after dealing with such unforeseen brutality are life-altering. These four men, city men, suddenly confronted with a situation with never imagined, raise the bar from action to horror.It's a classic to be sure. And the phrase you have a pretty mouth has been quoted endlessly, from Saturday Night Live to off-the-cuff comments around water-cooler at work, this movie is without a doubt a huge part of our societal pop culture...as much as Make my day or I'll be back ever were.So what would YOU do if you found your friends being sexually assaulted at gunpoint by mountain men far away from your life in the city, cozy bed, wife and kids? And if you took the measures Burt Reynolds did (and I would have done the same) would you bury the body beneath the soon-to-be-lake, or stand trial and take your chances? The bottom line is Deliverance delivers. You can take that to the bank. If this movie doesn't get under your skin, then you are not human.Even if you have seen this before, rent it again and ask yourself the above question.My favorite part of the film remains the same Ed failing to kill the deer...then changing. Life and it's unpredictable circumstance can change a man. And I suppose that's what this film is all about Jon Voight, in particular, as Ed, gives the best performance here. And he remains one of the more gifted actors in Hollywood history, from Midnight Cowboy to his highly underrated performance as Franklin D. Roosevelt in Pearl Harbor, his acting lifts the movie to another level. Climbing the rocks at dusk, terrified and determined to make it right It needs to be seen to be believed. I guarantee your heart rate will elevated to a new level.Briskly paced, tense, taut and tightly drawn as a as a banjo string, this is a morality play that asks questions that remain today. Times have changes, but our choices as human beings have not.Ten out of ten stars.

Along the way, a raft (no pun intended) of unpleasant things happen to the men. Despite the nasty happenings in this picture, Boorman captures the natural beauty of the river nicely. The location was really chosen well. Indeed, this would still be a very nice film to watch, had the canoe trip gone smoothly. The lush forests and gentle landscape only make the horror more horrible. Not only is the location scenic, but also beautifully shot thanks to cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond. It has been said that Burt Reynolds' performance as the outdoorsman, Lewis, is the star acting role in this film. I reckon however, that Jon Voight steals the show with his role as the suburban family man, Ed, who is rapidly forced to change his demeanour in order to survive. In fact, the scene in which climbs the cliff was not a stuntman. It was Voight himself. To cut costs the filming wasn't insured and the actors did their own stunts. The soundtrack is particularly noteworthy. Eric Weissberg's and Steve Mendel's performance on guitar and banjo as part of the Duelling Banjos sequence remains one of the most awesome pieces of soundtrack in the history of cinema for the sheer intensity of its performance. At a couple of other points in the movie, we are treated to more, softer, banjo music which provides a very pleasant accompaniment to the trip down the river For all the good points of this film, I did find it a little lacking in purpose. It doesn't build suspense very well and it isn't really as gruesome as we have been led to believe. The plot itself is somewhat poor and it doesn't really go anywhere. Nevertheless, this movie has enough good points to get my recommendation. I did like it but for fans of gore, there isn't really much of it. None really, in fact. It isn't so much a horror film as an adventure film that turns a little bit sour. Think of it like Rambo First Blood meets Three Men In A Boat. Look out for a very young Charley Boorman as Ed's son. I did like this movie, the soundtrack, cinematography and acting earns it a well deserved 7 out of 10.

As we put our boats into the water, banjoes echo in the back of the conscious mind. This movie is timeless because it waxes philosophical of human's place in nature and technology's effect upon man's relationship with nature. We see it in the bow fishing. We see it in the home made tent. There is also city man's disdain and feeling of superiority to the rural woodsman cracker. The fact that the Banker from Atlanta (Ned Beatty) has bad teeth is meant to put him on the same level with the woodsmen who also have bad teeth. Ultimately, the struggle of life and death supersedes civilized man's suppositives about The Law. This canoe trip ends too soon for the viewer, but alas Not Soon Enough for the characters.

The idea of living the Chulawasse river before it's turned into a lake comes from Burt Reynold's Lewis, who unconsciously drowns his fellas into their worst nightmare. But if the first half of the film appears rather like an action movie, the second half carries the viewer into a totally different story, with our men forced to make a decision that (they know) will change their lives forever. In very bad ways. At the end of the movie, each person is gonna be forced to deal with the scars of what had just to be a quite week-end on the river but muted into a fight for survival. The movie (except some pretty evident goofs) is very well directed and beautifully shot into a paradise of nature that steals your breath. The photography is excellent as well. Voight, Reynolds, Cox and Beatty are all excellent in showing how a single event can ruin in different ways four different lives only tied to the same mistake.

While your jaw is dropped during a Terminator movie, are you really sacred? I don't think so, because you are there to see what new CGIs have been strung together - plot matters not.So many daily situations can become terrifying for no reason at all, because there are so many people involved in daily living - like a trip to the market.....or a walk down a dimly-lighted street. Deliverance is SO frightening, because those innocent actions can turn deadly in a heart-beat. Venturing into the backwoods is a frolic in fun? Anyone who has that notion does not read the papers, watch the daily news, nor has not seen some of the other movies that depict the seriousness of trespassing into territories where outsiders are not welcome. It is almost unbelievable that the advance dish on Deliverance didn't inform almost everyone going to view it this was no picnic, and squeal like a pig wasn't a part of Deulling Banjos.I hate the term hillbillies, because - as some users wrote - that demeans entire regions of people who are very content to live as they know how - without the interference of modern life. Much is made of inbred - that is not sexuality peculiar to the backwoods. Chinatown should teach us that lesson. However, city-slickers are extremely dumb to enter a closed society and give them attitude. I know lots of hillbillies - they are moral people, when left to themselves. Their justice can be brutal when they feel threatened or humiliated, just like the justice in city streets. They don't need any part of the city - the city should take its canoe-ing and camping to legal sites.Deliverance was the last film I found Jon Voight to do any real acting - I hope I'm wrong. He was extremely underpaid for Midnight Cowboy, because he was unknown, but demonstrated that he could do that role at the drop of a hat. His acting in Deliverance was superb. It gave us a clear demonstration ordinary people can move mountains, if it's necessary - but who wants to be thought-of as ordinary today? His stifled sob at the dinner was brilliant. Wow! for Burt Reynolds !!! One must ask what led him into those other tacky films? His manliness, although misguided, in this film set the pace for the endurance necessary to make it out of the wilderness - not only in the backwoods, but the wilderness of everyday-life. Ned Beatty was stellar - his underwear may not have had Versace stitched on it, but his shell-shocked performance was perfect. As noted, he became stronger than any of the group by the end of the movie. Ronny Cox played the moral guy to the hilt - every man should have his determination to do what is right. Several users have theorized he was shot, or lost his balance when he pitched-into the river - my theory is that he was so disgusted with the whole journey, he committed suicide. No gunshot was heard during the scene and Voight and Beatty did not find a wound.James Dicey certainly knows how to weave a suspenseful tale, and was great as the sheriff - it is said he was so terrified of acting he came to the set drunk every day. His character could see the three canoe-rs were guilty of surviving, but also knew they didn't stand a chance against a jury of the local people, no matter how kindly they were treated in Aintry. He was also aware that the meaner of the locals could be cruel. Justice ? - don't come back up here again. Not many users knew hillbillies were used in the film where ever it was possible - what actors could portray them better? The mountain-men WERE actually mountain-men.......Every detail of this movie was perfect - no doubt it was dangerous to play in. Play in? Better fight-for-your-life in. I've experienced some near-dangerous incidents, and am content to live outside of the fray - you guys who feel your manhood raging can have my part.That we have absolutely killed - and continue to do so - irreplaceable areas of this country in undeniable. To be able to view its grandeur on any media is enthralling, but it leaves a bitter taste to realize some do not care about it. Los Angeles, where I live, is a perfect example it's built-up right into the territories for wild animals, and steadfastly believes humans come before animals. Those are their rightful habitats - we should leave them be just that. Any wonder why coyotes and bears and wolves wander into neighborhoods? They're theirs.In some less threatening way, we all need to experience the lessons to be learned from Deliverance - to understand our advancement technologically does not lead to supremacy. I thank all those city-slickers who went out into the wilderness to produce this modern classic, so that it can scare the heck out of me when I watch it. You can have the thrill of danger - I'll stick to the TV. 30-out-of-10.

The first half-hour or so of the film is peaceful and pastoral in character, with the scenery of the area lovingly photographed, and the friends spend their time hunting, fishing and shooting the white-water rapids on the river. Then the tone of the film abruptly changes when two of the adventurers meet two unfriendly locals. They are threatened at gunpoint, tied up and one of them is subjected to a homosexual rape. Just when it seems that they are about to be killed, they are saved by the arrival of their two companions, who kill one of the mountain men with a bow and arrow and drive off the other.What had started off as an adventure now turns into a nightmare. The four have to try and escape, terrified that the surviving mountain man will return seeking revenge. The river, once their playground, now seems like their prison. The rapids mean that they cannot return upstream, so the only way they can get out is by climbing the steep cliffs of the gorge through which the river passes or by pressing onwards though even more dangerous rapids. (A more recent thriller, The River Wild, has exploited a similar situation).Tensions arise within the group as they quarrel about how best to proceed and whether to report the man's death to the authorities.This was one of a number of films that were made possible by the relaxation in the sixties and seventies of the cinema's strict code of morality but which seemed deeply shocking. What caused the controversy here was not so much the killing (there is less bloodshed than in the average Western, and certainly less than in the average war film) as the scene of the homosexual assault. Until the sixties any direct mention of homosexuality was virtually taboo, and a scene like this one would have been unthinkable. Many of those films seemed ground-breaking then but look very dated today, generally those which were deliberately made as erotica (like the Emmanuelle series) or for their shock value (like Caligula). Some directors, however, including John Boorman, used the freedom given by the liberalisation of censorship restrictions for serious purposes.In some respects Deliverance is similar to another controversial film made the previous year, Sam Peckinpah's Straw Dogs. In that film too there is a clash between urban and rural lifestyles, a confrontation which turns violent as the city-dwellers defend themselves against hostile rustics, and a controversial rape scene. Both Peckinpah and Boorman intended their films to make a statement about violence, and both looked at the subject not from the viewpoint of the original perpetrators but from the viewpoint of victims who themselves resort to violence in retaliation or self-defence. Deliverance, however, is in my view the better film. Whereas the battle between Dustin Hoffman and his attackers in Straw Dogs always seems implausible, Boorman makes the four men's predicament seem frighteningly real.Another reason why Deliverance succeeds is the excellent acting of the four principals, especially Burt Reynolds and Jon Voight. This is important because the four main characters are all individualised. Reynolds's character Lewis, self-assured and confident, starts off as the leader of the group, but can be complacent and self-satisfied, underestimating the potential dangers of their situation. He is strongly against to informing the police about the killing, and in this he is opposed by the more liberal Drew who believes in sticking to the letter of the law. Bobby, the victim of the rape, is traumatised by his experience. Voight's character, Ed, is initially reserved and timid, but emerges as the leader after Lewis is injured. At first he is either too compassionate or too timid to kill a deer, but later finds himself capable of killing a man. (Reynolds's performance came as a revelation to me, as previously I had simply regarded him as the mustachioed embodiment of seventies machismo).On one level, Deliverance is an exciting and very tense thriller (and a very good one as well). There is, however, more to it than that. The film is also about character, a study in leadership, of the changing dynamics within the small group, and of how men react to danger, whether that danger comes from others or from the forces of nature. It touches on themes of the male psyche, of violence in society and of man's relationship to nature.

He is the macho man in the group. He attempts to lead men in an unforgettable canoe trip. Jon Voight is equally good as a business man who attempts to prove his manhood. Ned Beatty is outstanding and symbolizes man's rape of nature. Ronny Cox is the man who cannot cope with the guilt of the murdered Mountain Man. Herbert Cowboy Coward is perfectly cast as the Toothless Man. Vilmos Zsigmond's cinematography is second to none.

This movie proves that cinema has really changed over the last thirty years. The movie could not be made now. The story is mostly plausible albeit a little over the top in several sequences. All the performances are really superb, especially Voight as the conflicted Ed. The musical score is very catchy yet is creepy after watching the movie, sort of like The Exorcist's Tubular Bells. The cinematography is equally unnerving through its beauty and harshness. This is probably one of the most brutal movies you will ever see. This movie will haunt you for a REALLY long time.

Consequently, the four main characters must come to terms with the laws of nature in order to maintain their security & livelihood. In spite of Boorman's lackluster effort to achieve a powerful conclusion, the collective performances of the actors involved in Deliverance truly shine, ultimately shedding light on the degradation suffered at the hands of another human being and therefore, Deliverance offers an intriguing and concise perspective into the depths of human behaviour. ~TheSilencingMachine&#153; "},{"Title":"Symbolism of characters","Date":"14 April 2005","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Thriller","Review":" This movie involves the masculine,survivalist,enviromentalist,anti-hi-tech,(Lewis Burt).The somewhat passive government-trusting do what's right..always. musician, liberal,(Drew Ronny).The extremely cushy, chubby, civilized, used-car-salesman personna,(Bobby Ned) And last but not least, the true hero, and a combination of the best of the other three characters traits, all in on person, (Ed Jon).

Yes, that scene I'm talking about where Bobby (Ned Beatty) is forced to strip down to his underwear, and shortly after, is raped by a snarling, toothless hillbilly who seeks to dominate the cowering and frightened city man (I'm gonna make you squeal like a pig. Weeeeeeeeee!). This scene and others like it make up one of the most disturbing films about human brutality ever captured on celluloid. The plot four Atlanta businessmen (Burt Reynolds, Jon Voight, Ronny Cox, and the aforementioned Beatty) take a canoing trip on the Appalachian river. Things get ugly when that scene rolls around, when the four men encounter two bloodthirsty backwoodsmen, and it quickly evolves into an experience none of the men will ever forget. It's a daring feat that John Boorman (who followed this up with the superior 1981 fantasy adventure, Excalibur) was at the helm of this violent, disturbing thriller that dives deep into what makes man the way he is, and in detailing the line where civilization ends, and reality begins. Boorman's film, adapted from James Dickey's novel of the same title, is savage and definitely not for the faint-of-heart.8/10 "},{"Title":"Bring us into Deliverance","Date":"18 January 2005","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Thriller","Review":" 'We're gonna rape this land, we're gonna rape it' Its Stand By Me for grown ups. Deliverance contains something simplistic that never fails to shock, excite and horrify altogether. Yet even since 1972 it is a testament to the golden oldies that never diminish from the audience's mind. It is very fast paced and aggressive from the start, something you can watch in an hour and a half, yet still the naturalistic approach of director John Boorman remains true to the original story; it is not over sensationalised with music or flimsy acting, or under achieved in any way. It is an account of the terrors that lurk in the backwater, small country towns where strangers are neglected, threatened, terrorised. Much of the movies' story balances on the horrific male rape scene; perpetuated with slow burning use of editing that builds up the tension to danger levels. It's a modern classic; the year of Clockwork Orange; ultra violence at it's best when it seems to come true. Yet still, Deliverance remains even after the land is gone beneath the raging waters.

Yet it is more than simply that. The men of the mountains do prey on the men of the city but in the end are destroyed themselves. The flooding that will come anyway will obliterate everything, the dead bodies, the scene of the crime, the wilderness itself. There is a strange melancholic and apocalyptic feel to the film. It is filmed brilliantly. There is nothing unreal about the canoeing scenes. The actors are there fighting the currents and the rocks. You can feel their exhilaration as they paddle along. Then it all comes unstuck and each man reacts accordingly. The four male leads, John Voight. Burt Reynolds, Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox,  are all solid and believable, possibly Reynold's finest screen performance. The music is sparse and based on the 'Duelin' Banjos' theme that is as memorable as the zither tune from 'The Third Man'. The scene where it is introduced is rightly hailed as a classic. There is so much going on in that scene on so many layers. John Boorman is a director with a raft of interesting films to his name and this is one of his best.

The ratings code of 1968 (R, X) was a few years old, sex, violence, nudity, language were all allowed in ways like never before, and for some reason (maybe sex plus violence)rape movies were all the rage.  But it was usually women getting raped  Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange, Siegel's Dirty Harry, Peckinpah's Straw Dogs, Hitchcock's Frenzy.Then, along came Deliverance, and it was time for the men to get the willies, literally.  I suspect that more than a few women enjoyed seeing the tables turned,. The male rape scene is what put Deliverance on the map in 1972, along with, oddly enough, a delightful instrumental duet called Duelling Banjos that was a Top Forty hit on the radio! (In the movie, this duet comes early, and is haunting one player is a decidedly scary looking, silent backwoods boy.)In many ways, Deliverance was simply a modern outdoor adventure tale.  Four suburban males (macho Burt Reynolds and three more soft fellows) take a canoe trip down a desolate Georgia river and must survive.   City boys lost in the wilderness.  About all audiences were expecting was a rapids ride, but thanks to that terrifying sexual encounter with some inbred hillbilly men, Deliverance was the an old-time adventure in the sexually explicit, realistically violent manner of the early 70's. They certainly don't make them like this anymore.P.S.  Here's a question given what happens to each of the four heroes, which one would you want to be?

Voight, Reynolds, Beatty and Cox were all young, strong, talented and totally committed to both their craft in general and roles in particular.  It's one thing to perform dangerous stunts for the camera with insurance--extremely risky business without, as in this case.  Of course, no reputable company would risk financing a cast and crew in paddleboats braving the treacherous rapids of South Carolina's lake jocassee and Georgia's Chattooga River.  Especially commendable was Mr. Voight's volunteering to do his own stuntwork, in one scene scaling a 95 degree mountainside--with Vilmos Zsigmond's camera teetering close at hand.  Yet it is these potentially perilous scenes which give this drama its special edge.Fortunately for all concerned, no serious physical mishaps occurred, and the production wrapped intact.  There's no doubt that all involved realized they were working on a very high quality project, and elected to give it their all.  Mr. Reynolds in particular may chalk this one up as his finest career achievement. Whatever concerns may have occurred between Director Boorman and Writer Dickey, along with other productional challenges, is now moot, as appreciative audiences continue to be thrilled by this solid enactment of Dickey's novel-based screenplay.

What could be more frightening than being lost, isolated, and hunted.  The movie opens with our 4  city folks heading for a weekend jaunt to an unspoiled river that won't exsist in a few weeks. It is being dammed to provide power to the ever growing Atlanta.  Knowing ahead of time what was coming, I had a hard time sympathizing with these four guys.  Lewis, Bobby, and Ed were rude to the locals of this inbred mountain town. The only redeeming member was Drew who decides to have an impromptu guitar/banjo jam with a very creepy but talented boy. These guys were kind of cocky and other than Lewis I wasn't sure why they came along for such a trip.  Commence rafting, and camping and then some more rafting.  Cue the infamous Squeal scene.  I didn't quite understand the dynamic here.  These 2 grown men allow themselves to be completely overpowered, without so much as a fight, a kick, a punch.....nothing.  The most pathetic part of Ned Beatty's rape sequence is watching him try to crawl up the hill while the mountain man is grabbing on to his briefs like some sort of harness.  Cue Bert Reynolds and his bow, saving Ed, Bobby and this movie from an X rating. Now here is another part I had trouble understanding.  If I was in this group and this series of events just occured to me or my friends.  I would have abosolutely no moral dilema with offing this cretin and getting the hell out of Dodge!  But the guys fight amoungst themselves over the moral dilema of having just killed a man. Nevermind that the man was gonna rape and probably kill 2 men. Drew, the guitar plucker, thinks they should take the high road and let the law handle things.  Thank goodness cooler heads prevailed and the guys decide burial was the right way to go.  How perfect!! This place will be under several feet of water in a few days.  The rest of the film consists of these guys trying to escape from an enemy that might not even be there.

Spoilers may be revealed.the story/plot wasn't good - Though I disagree, this movie isn't really about the plot.  Sure, there are specific events that had to happen within a certain sequence to form a backdrop, but that is NOT what this movie is about.  The movie is about the characters' journey, their reaction to the circumstances they encounter.  I found myself thinking what would I do? many times while watching this movie.  That is a sure sign of a character film.  The plot is not detailed because it doesn't have to be.There were only like 10 lines of dialogue - umm, were we watching the same movie?  Not only is there a decent amount of dialogue but it all sounds like REAL people talking.  For example - after the guy who rapes Bobby is killed, none of the typical Hollywood yeah die you sick fuck! type dialogue exists.  Instead you hear the thoughts of four normal men pour out about the realization that they have just taken the life of another human being. I'll take this dialogue over Elisabeth Shue yelling I'll show you hell! in 'Hollow Man' any day.the acting was bad - Could you do it?  Have you ever been in a situation like that the characters in this movie faced?  Unlikely, and I doubt that Voight, Beatty, Cox or Reynolds have either.  Given that circumstance ALONE, I believe the performances in the film to be outstanding.There are other things I could address, but if you don't agree with me up to this point then I won't even bother.  Just go rent 'Scary Movie' again and I'm sure you'll be happy.

I have to say, first of all, that I totally agree with the person who said that you SHOULD ALSO READ THE NOVEL. Like any other story, all of the various elements within it can NEVER be transferred to the screen - novels are just too long and involved. I totally DISAGREE that Boorman did a crappy job of directing or that this film in ANY WAY stinks. The first time that I saw this is when it came out in 1972. In judging this picture, you need to remember that societal expectations were a LOT different (in America) than they are today. EVERYONE was talking about the rape scene in this movie. NO ONE had filmed something like that, that I know of - or that I remember anyone else ever having heard of being in a movie at that time. Most probably, the issue hadn't been addressed within a novel, either - until Dickie wrote this. I was 14 when I snuck in to see this - and it had an impact even though I knew what was coming. I'd read the book right after seeing it - and, again, it's MUCH more involved and dramatic. A few years ago, I took a course called The Male In American Literature and was surprised and pleased to find that Deliverance was on the syllabus as one of the stories we'd be studying. In re-reading this as an adult (and after a higher education) there were many things I had never noticed before. Dickie uses a LOT OF foreshadowing in the story - right down to something that no one else in the class noticed, but I did the color orange is often associated with caution and he mentions it a whole lot of times. I went back and watched the movie again, as well - it had been many years since I had first seen it. I did notice what another reviewer mentions here - that you never do see the identity of that other person in the tow truck - and I mentioned to my friend that for the first time I thought it was those same guys who were involved in accosting the canoeing party further downriver. Someone else mentions here (in these reviews) about how the kid who had played Dueling Banjoes with Drew doesn't even acknowledge him when they are passing under him, under the bridge. Again - foreshadowing - another subtle hint that something terrible is about to happen. I don't think that this story - whether the book or the novel - is a bad one at all. I agree totally with the person who said that there are much deeper elements at work here. If you thought the movie stunk, read the book - then go back and give the movie another chance. You'll understand the story better and will see it in a totally different light. It is also interesting how in this story, like in Harper Lee's American classic To Kill A Mockingbird, the author raises the question if killing another human being is ever justified. I don't think that any of can really say, with complete conviction and assuredness, that we never could. I sure as hell wouldn't have wanted to go through something like that canoe trip. But we all have our own baggage in life, don't we? All have our own stories to tell - if not about ourselves and things that have happened to us, then certainly about horrible things which have happened to someone we know. In closing, I'd just like to say that whoever compared this to Blair Witch ...  Well, let's just say that I think any 5-year-old could have made the latter. There's NO comparison in literary value, so to speak. I debated asking for my money back from renting the tape. Had I spent the extra money to see it at the theater, I definitely would have walked out half way through, and would most likely have demanded my money be returned. Deliverance is NOT trash. The characters are VERY realistic, the story line is haunting in subtle undertones, and the acting is nothing short of EXCELLENT. Personally, I can't see how anyone would think any different of it, but we're all entitled to our opinion.

The Blair Witch Project, a frightening motion picture, has some elements of Deliverance the sensation of being lost, the fear and the breaking point in which all of us have to search inside our hearts for courage. Reynolds is in his most impressive interpretation, his acting is, by far, the best one. Without his trademark mustache, and in a  complex and difficult part, Reynolds does a memorable interpretation. For  Lewis'role, Boorman wanted, at first, Marlon Brando, then James Stewart and Henry Fonda. When all of them heard about the Chatooga river's  risks,they turned down and Reynolds got the job.But Voight is also great, such as Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox. In a brave interpretation, Beatty has the strongest scene and he goes through it with professionalism and realism.It's impressive how Deliverance made its own progresses, in terms of bringing a new kind of horror to the screen.Ultimately, Deliverance is the kind of movie that will make you stay away from the woods...

The build-up at the start is particularly tedious with Ronny Cox having some weird guitar off with a creepy looking kid - not only was it pointless, but it also went on for far too long. I could have also done without all the nonsense regarding finding people to drive their cars to the other side of the river. It all amounted to unnecessary drawn-out filler which started to get on my nerves.At this point I was still prepared to forgive the film and hoped that it would be a slow-burning film that would become something magnificent, but sadly this was not the case. The first encounter with the hillbillies was quite good and was what I would call mildly suspenseful, but after this scene Deliverance never really became the exciting and tense picture that the film poster suggests it is. In fact, the only really interesting part of the film was the moral debate that the group have about disposing of the body or turning themselves in. This aspect was quite interesting, but perhaps it stood out more for me because of how poor the rest of the film was as a whole.I think the main reason I was disappointed was that I hoped it would be more of a cat and mouse film or a hunt or be hunted type affair, but it doesn't offer the viewer this experience. Rather than being on the edge of my seat, I found myself close to nodding off. It doesn't even work when looked upon as a character building experience as the characters are never really given any development meaning that this film really failed from pretty much every angle.The only good thing about this film were the performances from the four main players (with Ronny Cox and Jon Voight being particularly good) and it was also nice to see Ronny Cox playing a good guy for a change. The acting was very good here and did elevate the film slightly. As a whole though, this film is slow, boring, and basically lacks any real suspense and tension. I've given it a 3 out of 10, but only for the good performances from the principal cast.

The men cross paths with two hillbillies from the backwoods and the canoing trip soon turns from a fun trip to a nightmare of survival. Lewis sees Bobby in the woods being humiliated and sodomized by one of the hillbillies. He takes matters into his own hands and shoots and kills the man with a bow and arrow. The men then face a decision on whether to call the authorities or bury the man in the countryside that will soon be covered in water. After a vote the men decide to bury the man and continue down river to get to their cars that are waiting for them. On their adventure down stream Drew decides not to wear his life jacket and falls into the river at some rough rapids. This causes his boat to collide with the other boat and all four men end up in the water. Lewis breaks his leg and convinces Bobby and Ed that Drew was shot by the hillbilly. This provokes Ed to climb the gorge and kill the other hillbilly. The three men make it to their cars and are questioned by the authorities. The men are not charged and they go their own ways. I think that this movie raises some questions on what exactly happened to Drew. I question if the hillbilly actually shot Drew or if he could not face what had happened on the river. It also makes you wonder why he would not wear his life jacket knowing that there had been rough rapids and they would probably face more.

Then, I didn't understand it. A few years later it turned up on one of the Cable movie channels and I watched it uncut.After seeing it the way it was intended, I found this to be a film of human nature against nature plunged to the very depths of horror. Four men who wanted to go on a innocent canoe trip before the stream became home to industrialism, endure the worst weekend of their lives.First of all, I've gotta comment on Burt Reynolds as the Alpha male. He was perfect for this role - his manner, his dress, his style. Ronny Cox seemed to be the one who strategized his horrors by having the law outside of where they were take care of the problems. Jon Voight proved to be more than the fair haired boy, the family man who had to reach deep in his soul to make decisions and survive, and Ned Beatty was obviously the weakest and got the worst of the ordeal - on the trip and after.Second there is John Boorman, the director. Everything he directs has a backdrop of nature, environment and humans interactions in it. This piece is no different - but it's something you wouldn't know unless you watch other John Boorman films, and you should. Then go back and watch this one uncut. He has a knack for exposing the deepest darkest roots of nature and man's fascination with it.Third, there are the quotable phrases I heard for years and had no idea they came from this movie. You gotta real pretty mouth and Squeal like a pig are in the top 10 of quotable lines. And music? Well, I used to like Dueling Banjos but now I've got this image in my head so now when I hear it, I get chills now that I know where it got it's popularity and I laugh earnestly when I see comedians and writers use this in their spoof skits.Here is a film that is violent, sexually explicit, makes you question the depths of humanity - the law - a call of adventurism - trying to rule nature - makes you wonder what would YOU do? - makes you think about how much can you take and remain normal after trauma - and will have you questioning your next weekend canoe trip with friends to parts unknown.

The film manages to show how a group of ordinary men who are just taking are short break can get wound up in such meaningless acts of terror. The first half hour of Deliverance is like watching a different film to the one that comes out latter. The first scenes show these normal men just having a good time and some beautiful imagery of the American land that surrounds them. The scenes after this are very different, the film all of a sudden turns out to be very dark and asks the viewer What would would you do in this situation? This is disturbing and shows just how when people are not around the cops become cruel and meaningless. This all leads up to showing how human nature can be so evil when left to it's bitter beginning.The film is definitely not one of entertainment value and is a film a film to be studied and thought about long after the chilling and depressing closing credits. What makes the film so depressing is that the action that causes everything to kick off is meaningless and so immoral that it is heart wrenching. You also feel as though the film is teasing you with the purposely inappropriate banjo music as the soundtrack. Deliverance is very different to most films, it's not afraid to put the viewer through such tense and nail-biting situations. Not only is the film disturbing, it is also very sad. It shows how a group of innocent men's lives are changed from something so pointless and pitiless. The atmosphere creates a real feeling of menace and lurking evil.Through all this the film is one amazingly harrowing experience and really does make you think about the ideas of how men can change when put through life and death situations. The men's stress makes them turn into something different to their normal self's, they have to become almost in-human to defeat the threatening evil that hangs over them like a shadow. Every single one of these men's lives are automatically altered through such a terrifying experience. You never know what's round the corner and in the end the men are fighting to survive.The acting by the cast is tremendous and Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds show very intense attitudes and you really know the kind of people they are by the end of the movie. The film is a character study, it's a real life horror movie and a great image of isolation captured on lens. The direction techniques are very precise and capture the beautiful American landscape where this terrible journey occurs. The film also perfectly displays a culture that is in isolation, most often called hillbillies. The film for sure makes you have a real fear and loathing for the kind portrayed in the film. Of course not all of them are crazed loonies, but the film does put that attitude across. The techniques of camera shots used show the stress, anger, destruction, terror and beauty wonderfully.The scripting for the film is perfect and is filled with so many memorable scenes and imagery. The image of Burt Reybolds holding up the bow and focus on his dilated pupil, is a very cold image. Deliverance is certainly one of the best films ever made, it mixes so many techniques to create a masterpiece. Watch it now, but be prepared for something to make you think and that is very different...

In another, the shoe was finally on the other foot.Ironic   men were indeed upset at the Deliverance rape scene, but rather quickly turned it into the butt of jokes that continue to this day  Squeal like a piggy! and You've got a purty mouth, boy have moved from lines of terror to lines of comedy.

The creepy quotient is high in this and I think it is partly because it is driven by the sense of isolation and not necessarily by the level of violence. And who cares if the canoing scenes sometimes don't look altogether realistic. That's hardly the point. One of the other reviewers makes a good point that the scene of the crime will soon be wiped out by flooding, which I think is one of the creepiest aspects of the film. Besides, the actors took some tremendous risks in filming some of those scenes, so I think that kind of criticism is unfair to say the least. Also, this film was nominated for Best Picture in 1972, but the Godfather won that year, so no chance there, although the other pictures nominated probably were not the equal of Deliverance, so if the Godfather had not been in the picture, who knows? It would be difficult to argue against the nominees for Best Actor that year, but perhaps they could have nominated Reynolds for Best Supporting? Of course, then he would have been competing against Pacino, Caan and Duvall from the Godfather, who cancelled each other out and Joel Grey won for Cabaret Tough call.

The trip starts off fine but soon the four are working against the odds to get off the river with their lives after they encounter a couple rednecks. To me this is one of the greatest films of the decade but I think it's also one of the most chilling ever made and still packs a wonderful punch after all these years. To me the movie is about nature and trying to survive in it no matter what gets thrown at you. Out of the four characters only one, Reynolds, claims to know what he's doing yet as the men get closer into darkness the other find themselves trying to fight through their own fears. The movie has one great sequence after another and so many memorable moments including the terrific Dueling Banjos sequence, which of course eventually leads to the nightmarish sequence in the woods that everyone knows about now. The pig sequence has become someone of a joke now due to everything that's been on television but to me this scene still packs one hell of a punch because of how terrifying it is. The performances by Bill McKinney and Herbert Coward are downright chilling and really add to the terrifying situation these men are faced with. The nightmarish tone, almost like a horror film, doesn't end here because the rest of their trip down the river will have the viewer holding their breath because of the unknown, which is going to follow. I always thought the river played a big part in the film because it seems when the water is calm so are the men. It gives them a chance to breathe but when the rapids pick up so does the dangerous situations going through them. The calmness before the rape leads to the men leaving in a rush, confused and not knowing exactly what's to follow and then they run into the faster rapids again. The calmness then brings them to the next situation of the mountain, which is a brilliantly executed sequence. Another major plus is some wonderful cinematography, which to me is among the best ever in a film. The way the camera makes the river and locations a part of the story also adds a chilling effect. Even the performances are rather remarkable with all four leads bringing so much personality and development to their characters. I'm really not sure Reynolds was ever better and Voight gives another terrific performance during this hot part of his career, which started a few years earlier with Midnight Cowboy. While the banjo and rape sequences have become the best known I still think the greatest moment in the movie is right after the rape when the men have to discuss what to do. The performances and dialogue really makes this sequence one of the most memorable from the decade, which was full of great movies. I think another reason the movie works so well because it's never really clear what happened to the men. Certain situations come up yet we're never really given the answers as to what is happening and to me this just adds more chills to the movie.

Basically four city men Ed Gentry (Golden Globe nominated Jon Voight), Lewis Medlock (Burt Reynolds), Bobby Trippe (Ned Beatty) and Drew Ballinger (Total Recall's Ronny Cox) are hoping for a great adventure canoeing down the river. It starts quite well when they have some excitement getting down a waterfall of rocks, but this fun is to change. Soon enough Ed and Bobby are encountered by two hillbillies, (Bill McKinney, the normal one, and Herbert 'Cowboy' Coward, the toothless one) and at gun point are abused. When Lewis and Drew eventually arrive they kill the normal one, while the toothless one gets away, and they know they have to bury the body. They then carry on down the river, and Drew is the next victim, possibly because of the toothless guy who has a gun above them, and Leiws gets a wound. Ed goes up above to kill him, and the three men also find Drew's body. In the end, they do find civilisation, but obviously all of them won't forget (and have nightmares about) the incidents. Also starring James Dickey (the film is based on his novel, and he himself writes the screenplay) as Sheriff Bullard, Ed Ramey as Old Man, Billy Redden as Lonnie, Seamon Glass as First Griner, Randall Deal as Second Griner, Lewis Crone as First Deputy and Ken Keener as Second Deputy. The two scenes that stick out in my mind from this film are the disturbing male rape scene, but more prominently the Golden Globe nominated Duelling Banjos scene just after the opening credits. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Director for John Boorman (also nominated the Golden Globe), Best Film Editing and Best Picture, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing and Best Sound Track, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay. Burt Reynolds was number 97 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 46 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, the film was number 15 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, and it was number 45 on The 100 Greatest Films.

In a modern Deliverance, when Toothless Guy pokes Ed with the shotgun, Ed would duck to the right, grab the barrel, point it Rapist Guy and yank on it while Toothless' finger was still on the trigger, thus dispensing of Rapist before he actually did the act.In the '72 movie, Lewis shoots Rapist, then Ed grabs Toothless' shotgun, but fails to kill him. How lame is that? In a modern movie, Ed would have had no compunction against firing both rounds at Toothless while Lewis was firing off a couple of arrows at him.Then when it comes to the Big Decision, no one in a modern movie would think about going to the police for an inbred mountain man who raped one of their buddies. Everybody knows it's the Law of the Jungle when it comes to dealing with mountain men. Haven't they seen Deliverance?Besides all that, you couldn't make a movie like this today without showing arrows in Arrow Time, and instead of just breaking in half, the canoe would have been blow out of the water in a fiery explosion.The four businessmen from Atlanta would actually be from Michigan, Illinois, Kansas City, and India, having moved to the Atlanta suburbs within the past 4 years, but if you asked them, they would still say they were from Atlanta.Since anyone with a killer instinct like Lewis would be a Republican, he wouldn't really care so much about shooting the rapids one last time on a pristine river (too much like a liberal tree-hugger), as he would be looking forward to the time when river was gone and the lake was full so he could zoom around on his jet ski spewing pollution and making lots of noise.This is a beautiful movie, with a lot of quietness. It isn't silence, because there are always the ambient sounds of nature, of a small town, of a family dinner. But the quiet tension begins after the Dueling Banjos scene, and intensifies as the story progresses.That scene itself is an excellent representation of the joy of communicating through music. But it symbolizes the dualistic relationship of civilization to nature, because music is at once civilized and abandoned. Drew can commune with nature, or communicate with the boy through music, but in the end the boy rejects Drew's desire for friendship. You can commune with nature, but to be a part of it, you have to go all the way. You can be awed by nature's beauty, but to be a part of it requires pain and hardship few are willing to endure.People who are unable to put themselves in a character's place will find this film boring, and will think these men are a bunch of laughable pansies. I give it 10/10.

Running a difficult river takes skill acquired by training, which these characters did not have.Second, river running takes advanced planning and once on the river, scouting the rapids. River runners have to scout the tough rapids ahead of them before they run them. If the rapids are too difficult or unrunnable, the water craft have to be lined down the rapids with ropes.Third, river runners need a shuttle waiting for them at the end of the trip to return them to their vehicles or they need people to shuttle their vehicles to the landing.

To a viewer who knows nothing about this film, there are a bunch of surprises in place that will really make them squirm in their seat. The film looked fantastic, to the point that its really hard to believe how dated this film actually is. It's thirty six year old movie that looks like something that could be aired in theaters today. There is though, a few things that I didn't like. It's hard to determine if the character Lewis was supposed to be that strange and awkward or if Burt Reynolds just did a horrible job in his role. He's the cool guy of the group, who knows how to survive in the wilderness, who knows how to handle every situation perfectly. However at times he just seemed like an idiot, who has absolutely no idea what he's doing or talking about. It's easier to say that Reynolds botched up his role, being that he was never really considered that great of an actor. John Voigt, on the other hand, was superb. With the exception of the scenes where he's talking to himself on the mountain, he does an amazing job as the character everyone's supposed to relate to and feel for. I felt this movie was enjoyable ALMOST the whole way through. It could have ended a good twenty minutes before it did. Overall though, I really liked it.

The group is lead by Lewis,(Reynolds) a wanna be Tarzan, as Bobby would put it, and is also suppost to serve as the eye candy for the ladies. Bobby,(Beatty) is  undoubtedly the stuck up one of the group, who looks as though he's dressed to go to a golf course, rather than a rigorus weekend canoe trip in the middle of nowhere. Ed, (Voight) is the soft spoken follower of Lewis, but is eventually shoved into the role of the hero. Drew,(Cox) is the gentle guitar player, who takes part in the famous Dueling Banjos scean. But when push comes to shove, he is also the only character with any morels when it comes time for the men to make a decisio n that will change their lives forever.It starts out innocent enough for the men, a day of canoeing, fishing, and a night of drinking and sleeping on the ground in tents. As morning breaks, Ed trys his hand at hunting, but it's easy to see by the shaking of his hands, that he doesn't have the heart to kill even a deer. This will become a key point in the movie later, as Ed is forced into a similair situation, that could end or save his life.After a brief separation, one of the characters is raped by a local hunter, and the four men are reduced to animals, digging furiously with their hands to bury the man who was killed by them, clearly in self defence. But after one of their own is killed, one lie quickly snowballs into another. By the end, you can see that even though 3 out of the 4 city boys survived their horrible experience,it will haunt them for the rest of their lives, and none of them will ever recieve deliverance from it.5/5 stars for wonderful acting, story line, and for seeing Burt Reynolds cry like a baby.

This film brings Deliverance mountain men back to screen for the first time since Deliverance in 1972. 33 years after their performance, Maxin Magazine voted them the number one movie villains of all time and AFI has voted Deliverance to be number 15 in all time favorite Thrillers. Ghost Town story was written by Dean Teaster and DJ Perry as an Appalachain tale of folklore character Harmon Teaster from the late 1800's, Dean's great,great, grandfather. It weaves a tale of part of his life with the theme park Ghost Town in the Sky, where Dean's father and Hebert Cowboy Coward acted with the group called The Internationaly Famous Ghost Town Gunfighters. This group of eleven men were RB Coburn's gunfighter crew around 1961 through 1966. During this time they acted along side Hollywood greats such as Clu Gulager, Paul Fix, Frank McGrath, Burt Reynolds, Craig Hill, Donald May, Peter Brown, Veronica Cartwright, Dan Blocker, Tony Dow, John Broomfield, Jon Provost, Ken Weatherwax, Clint walker, Darby Hinton, Grant Sullivan, Larry Matthews, etc. Since Dean's father created the real character of Digger the Undertaker in the theme parks gunfights, he will also play the character Digger in the movie as a tribute to his late father Robert Doyle Teaster. Herbert Coward portrayed Old Zeke and Grandpappy in the gunfights as well, was discovered by Burt Reynolds on his visit to Ghost Town in 1963 when he played Quint Asper for the TV series Gunsmoke. Burt Reynolds later called him for the part of the Toothless Man in Deliverance. Herbert Cowboy Coward lost his two front teeth in a gunfight at Ghost Town in 1962, when Digger was being played by a fill in person in Robert Teaster's absence. The replacement Digger accidentally hit Herbert Cowboy Coward in the mouth with a Colt 45, knocking his front teeth out in front of an estimated 5000 people watching the gunfight. DJ Perry, who wrote this screenplay was able to weave parts of the gunfighter history in with the Harmon Teaster Appalachian's folklore tale. This movie will also be released at the same time of the Theme park re-opening scheduled May 2007, where the Ghost Town Partners (new owners) headed up by Hank Woodburn will return the park back to the Golden Years vision of original builder, Mr. RB Coburn, the mastermind behind Ghost Town in the Sky, Frontierland, and Six Gun Territory in Ocala Florida.Alaska Presley, and her late husband Hugh Presley were instrumental in the opening and operation of Ghost Town in the Sky with RB Coburn, and Russ Pearson, and Uncle Dan Carpenter. Today, she is one of the executive producers of the movie Ghost Town.Robert Bradley, the original character The Apache Kid, from the original crew of gunfighters is also an executive producer of the film.Harry Valentine, the Golden Voice of Ghost Town, is an associate producer of the film and is responsible for making erecting a large polished granite memorial at Ghost Town along with the new owners of the theme park, to created a memorial to the original crew of gunfighters and the Hollywood greats who visited the park in the early years. The memorial will be dedicated to Robert Doyle Teaster, for his portrayal of the character Digger the Undertaker, It will be placed in a waiting lounge area at the foot of the mountain where visitors wait to load the famous mile high chairlift and incline to the top of the mountain at Ghost Mountain Park.The movie will also Starr Stella Parton, Rance Howard, Charlie Mattheau, and a host of others.The movie was originally started by Dean Teaster as a documentary of the original gunfighters and the theme park Ghost Town in the Sky. When DJ Perry was brought on board, the project was turned over to CDI and they teamed up and turned it into this movie.

Several other reviewers have passed comments like 'boring', Obviously subscribers to the brain dead, 2 minute attention span, machine gun edited film school of (much of) modern cinema. Oh dear!Many other reviewers have passed comments like, for the 70's, an excellent film.. Err.., hang on a minute, the 1970s was probably the finest era of Hollywood cinema!! An era when there were; numerous, super talented leading actors who were noted for their ACTING rather than their looks, great directors, and interesting plots - coupled with a coming of age of cinematography and film/camera techniques. The 70's was an era when so many topics (war, love, crime, drama) were made into true classic, gripping must-see movies.Oh HOW I wish the same could be said today!! Getting back to Deliverance! I won't talk about the plot, as other reviews here talk in depth about that. I will simply say that this is one of the afore mentioned 'must-see' movies!! The acting throughout (by the leads and the support - many of whom were genuine locals) is extraordinary. Burt Reynolds in particular blew me away, simply because I never realised (when I first saw it) that he could be so utterly brilliant as an 'straight' actor - rather than a comedic actor. The cinematography is jaw dropping, and the editing is seamless (so unlike today movies today)- slow and relaxed in parts (allowing the film to 'breath') and tight and fast when needed.The sheer beauty of the photography is a joy, and the wonderful scenery and beautiful surroundings belie the horrible situation the four central characters find themselves in.Like all great movies, the movie contains COMPELLING sequences and in Deliverance there are two of note - 1) the dualling banjos scene, and 2) the infamous rape scene. Like the Russian Roulette scene in the Deer Hunter, or the 'Is it safe' dental torture scene in Marathon man - these scenes are utterly gripping, so brilliantly acted and believable, you cannot divert your attention from the screen. Such moments pass into movie legend. Such scenes are full of human drama - a drama that is intensified by the ACTING - and not ruined (as is often the case today) by needless, superfluous fast and rapid editing. The camera is allowed to dwell on actors faces, or actors as a group - so that the interaction is more realistic, and the movie watcher feels more like an 'observer' (instead of just being made to feel dizzy and sick - as is often the case with the over the top editing typical today!) I am 32, and how I envy the cinemagoer of the 70's. Thank god for DVD! The only down side of this movie is the negative image it portrays of the 'South'. I have seen several documentaries of life in the south, and have visited Georgia and the Carolinas. The majority of people I met (and observed on the documentaries) from the region are very friendly and helpful. For many 'southerners', two truths pervade, religion and poverty. Life is very, very tough for many of the people in these regions and they are suitably hardy and phlegmatic about life's struggles and death. There is a gritty and raw side to their character.I have travelled widely throughout the US, and the many of the people of the North Eastern US have not got a clue about life in the South.I don't want to get political, but George Bush Jnr could do with addressing some REAL social concerns (i.e. poverty) in his own country before 'preaching' to the wider world about 'democracy' and 'freedom'.The movie Deliverance portrays the poverty and hardship of the South (that still exists today) accurately, but it gives a disproportionate image of the 'evil' side of the region. Having said that - it is a story!!

After setting out on a lake and heading downstream, the four men encounter two hillbillies in the woods who tie up Voight to a tree and then sexually assault Beatty. But then Reynolds comes along in another canoe with Ronny Cox and shoots one of the hillbillies with a bow and arrow, killing him. The other hillbilly runs off into the woods, escaping unscathed. But their worst nightmares are just around the corner. Soon, the men must fight for their lives to get back to civilization alive.I saw this film at a very young age and almost definitely should not have as the rape scene really disturbed me. I stayed up to watch it late-night on television (an edited version) but I could still tell what was going on, they just cut the nudity.By today's standards the scene might not be as explicit as films such as Irreversible and Baise-Moi bu particularly when the hillbilly tells him to squeal like a pig, it's quite stomach-turning, especially to see at a younger age. When I was older I discussed the film with my father, who isn't much of a film fan. He would not watch it. I remember he told me that he thought the only reason people were still talking about it twenty years later was due to the fact that it had a rape scene. He considered it to be a sick movie that was trying to be controversial and explicit just for the sake of being so.I don't agree. Now that I'm older and have seen the film again through adult eyes I view it as a classic. One, I like it because it is deep, compelling and engaging. The characters are introduced expertly and we get to know them. Two, the whole paranoid and fear of being stranded in the middle of nowhere in an unfamiliar environment is freaky.

It had action of ordinary men under duress. It pitted a wild Mother Nature against our characters as well. It featured some interesting moral issues for the time.My how times have changed, and subsequent thousands of films have blunted the effect this once had. The summer action genre pulled the legs out on that side, and that's probably the main thing. But more interesting is the moral dimension. Here, Voight's character feels compelled to cover up the whole thing, and there is some question whether an innocent man was killed. But we as viewers have greater certainty that this is not so, it is just an additional matter to haunt the man. What has evolved since this is a simultaneous blunting and sharpening of moral acuteness in film, but in different types of film, leaving no room in the middle for this sort of thing. The blunting is obvious. As the economies of film raise costs, most stories have gotten simpler and less ambiguous. The bad guys are clear and despicable. In nearly all cases the `right' thing happens in the end, driven by test audience reactions.That's opened the market for a growing class of `art' or intelligent film, mostly independent. And many of these explore moral issues, some in extreme ways. That dulls the emotional impact of the comparatively minor damage of a guy who pushes through all odds, survives and lies about it.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 4 You can find something better to do with this part of your life.

It's almost like two different films were made. There is a long sequence where one of the protagonists scales a mountain to reach the top in the hopes he will find someone that is stalking them. This has to be one of the dumbest plot points I've ever seen as this stalker could easily shoot him on his long and arduous trek up the mountain. In fact, when he gets to the top, the stalker is conveniently looking directly away from him for some reason. This was just awful filmmaking.

So all decide on the Cahulawassee river which is special because soon it will be destroyed when a new and better electrical dam is built, so this is the last chance to river raft the famous Cahulawassee. From the beginning the four men find this territory is very different as it only consist of rednecks, hillbillies, and mountain men. And these people live very different ways of life who are not used to civilization. Only the four men discover after their raft trip begins in a raging river, the backwoods become terror as these hillbillies turn out to be their worst nightmares! The woods scene with Ned Beatty stripping down and being made squeal like a pig is just terrifying and frightening and this particular scene is long remembered and has it's place in pop culture. This film is certainly a classic a thumbs up for John Boorman who really showed that when people explore unknown territories you never really know what you may find and sometimes it turns out to be frightening terror.

Watching it last night, for the first time since then, I enjoyed it, but not as much as I was expecting.Some parts just didn't ring true.  After Burt Reynolds shoots the hillbilly, Ned Beatty makes a very half hearted attempt to grab the dead man, the others restrain him, and not a word is spoken.  That didn't seem to work for me.  Then why did John Voight climb the cliff to kill the hillbilly?  They weren't even sure that Ronny Cox had been shot.  Just get in the canoe and scarper who heaven's sake.  If the hillbilly had been trying to get them he could have picked them off as they sat about, and Voight would have been very vulnerable half way up a cliff.That said, it is still an iconic film.

The premise starts off simply, with a group of alpha males going for a canoe ride in the woodlands, but things take an expectedly dark turn. The narrative plays out in a standard way, but it goes to such deeper and more intricate lengths, particularly in it's display of violence. Here violence is taken to a level of brutality and shown in it's full glory, sinking deep into the brain and residing there.I think the film unfortunately peaks too early, with the infamous pig scene coming around the forty minute mark and that dug itself so deep inside of me that nothing that came after it could really compare. I think that the film really deconstructs these alpha male types and throws them through the ringer, pushing the audience through it with them. Particularly in the Jon Voight character I admired the way that they brought a lot more depth to him than I would have expected. There's this pacifism to him, where even in a kill-or-be-killed situation he's still hesitant to commit an act of violence, that I think spoke a lot truer to humanity than most thrillers do.After that infamous scene, though, it becomes kind of a standard thriller until the final act. Which was a good idea but given how brief the final act was, it didn't have as big of an impact as it should have. I think the film would have benefited from at least another half hour or so of the aftermath, instead of just a few quick scenes before disappearing. The ending though, is genius and at first felt a little too typical but the more I think about it the more I appreciate how simple and bluntly they let the audience know that this experience is never going to stop haunting these men.

Voight deserves special commendation from the moment the story takes its extremely violent turn, his eyes express everything you could ever want to know.There's a sense in which we've been here before the imagery of the river journey into human degradation is reminiscent of Conrad's HEART OF DARKNESS. The extra stuff we get here - scaling the rockface, the imminent inundation of the land - makes for good pictures but I'm not sure it adds much else. The thing about this sort of fiction is it doesn't go beyond the statement of what I regard as a fact we're all a step away from savagery.

I really believed straight from the beginning that these characters were real people. The minimal music contributed well to the feeling of the film, and the credibility of the actors was largely enhanced by the fact that they really did everything in this movie--they actually navigated the river much as their characters did, Reynolds learned to shoot a bow and arrow, and Voight really scaled that 200-foot-tall cliff. That being said, I felt there were many things that left the film lacking...The Cons Firstly, I believe a true wilderness film should encompass only challenges of the wilderness. Boorman (the director) even stated that the movie was a story about man testing himself against nature and discovering the hidden forces within himself that he never knew existed, but this is a blatant lie. Homosexual country hicks hardly qualify as 'nature'. That's nothing more than a severely overused stereotype at best, and a cheap way to introduce conflict into an otherwise decent wilderness movie. Another problem I had was when Drew was supposedly shot...to me it looked as if he was so stressed that he passed out and fell overboard. I thought the other three men were just panicking...I mean the guy had a shotgun--you should've heard the shot echoing across the rocky embankments. But okay, so then Ed climbs up the cliff, but instead of searching for the assailant and attempting to kill him under the cover of darkness before he gets a chance to kill his friends, he takes a nap. When he awakens, low and behold, there's the hick with the shotgun. So then he has his chance, but he freezes, even when his and his friends' lives depend upon him. This is not true to the character Boorman claims him to be--Boorman stated Ed was a mild-mannered businessman...with the instincts of a natural born killer. I mean, where is he getting this from?? The guy couldn't kill the deer, and he couldn't kill a man who potentially was going to kill him and his friends. He draws the arrow, aims, and then quivers till his muscles give out, fires and misses BOTH times. And Boorman calls that the instincts of a natural born killer?? I think someone should give Boorman a dictionary. And who exactly shot the hick with an arrow *right* before he was going to shoot Ed? Lewis and Bobby were 200 feet down. Yet another unsolved mystery I guess...Overall, my main complaint is that this movie is not true to what it proclaims to be about, which reprehensibly discredits an otherwise realistic movie. This is not man against nature, this is man against man that just happens to be in the wilderness. The only credibility comes from the fact that the actors really embarked on this journey in the back country of Georgia and really performed canoing, archery, and rock-climbing, with no insurance no less. However the plot had several flaws. I feel that this movie could've been more naturalistic and less stereotypical, however I did find it entertaining.5.5 out of 10 "},{"Title":"Shallow writing.

It is also contains a disturbing, but terrifyingly memorable, rape scene. The film induces genuine panic, terror, and somewhat more-or-less believable characters. It starts off slow but once the tension accumulates, Deliverance never looks back once.Burt Reynolds and Jon Voight may be at their finest here as two harrowed and injured men trying their hardest to survive. Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox are also excellent as two of the four friends that are each either physically or mentally tortured, or both. For the side characters the filmmakers decided to use town locals from where Deliverance was shot. This injects a huge touch of realism and naturality into the movie, making it all more scarily believable.Now for the one and only flaw of Deliverance It never delivers a clear message or statement of what it's trying to convey to us. Is it supposed to be about masculinity vs. the wilderness, living with the regret of murder, or is it about survival. Personally I believe the movie is about the human survival instinct, and also how far one may go to cover up a past mistake that could severely detriment their life. But who the hell knows, I guess it's all up to the viewer to decide what message they got out of the film.Overall Deliverance was a strong and powerful film, although I was never truly moved by it. It is very adventurous and heart stopping at times, and of course well acted and written. I give Deliverance a 3 out of 4.

Other than a disgusting and hard to watch rape scene (which is the only reason I figure this film is called 'Deliverance') there isn't another harrowing scene left. I don't know, maybe I was expecting them to be chased by inbred rednecks throughout the film, but instead we get an unrealistic argument that lasts way too long on whether to bury a redneck's body or not and a rather anti-climactic 'fight' scene. Credit must be given where credit is due though. It's a well made movie and the acting is solid. And the dueling banjos scene is memorable. Maybe this film is so well known because it is the first of it's kind, but that doesn't make it the best. I have seen better survival in the wilderness films. I would highly recommend 'The Edge' with Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin. Also 'Wrong Turn' is much more exciting than 'Deliverence' (although there are characters in that movie that are very annoying, but they get theirs).So all in all, it's quite a disappointment. If you want a good John Boorman movie see 'Excalibur' or even the underrated 'Exorcist II The Heretic' before seeing this one.

The cinematography is good. The scenery is spectacular and the script passes muster. But Deliverance is not the classic that I had been expecting. It seems to me that only the surface of all the various emotions were dealt with and scenes such as the aftermath of the rape and the argument about what to do with the body were glossed over incredibly quickly. As for the actual rape scene itself... well, I reckon that the main reason so many people find this so disturbing is because they're not used to such scenes involving a man. Society seems to have become horribly de-sensitised to the idea of women being raped because it happens, and is portrayed in the media, so often. When it happens to a man everyone throws back their heads and howls in horror, as if it were somehow worse than female rape.I'd say by all means watch this film, it is certainly worth one viewing at least. But if you want to see a good example of the sickening horror of what inbreeding can do (not that I'm saying this was the main theme of Deliverance) then watch the episode of The X-Files that deals with the subject. Now that really is truly, horrifically disturbing.

The infamous reputation of Deliverance preceded it and perhaps was too talked about because the film did not live up to it's reputation in my opinion. While decently acted, and with terrific cinematography of the Cahulawassee River the film deals more with the guilt and cover up of friends protecting themselves from a pair of insane mountain men who stalk and harass them. I thought the film would be far more dark, gritty, gory and disturbing and I know it seems as though many people look at me with shock and dismay and say 'are you kidding?' Maybe I'm warped and worn by the modern day gore of shockers and horror films but I didn't find Deliverance all that disturbing. I understand where it was trying to go psychologically but I found Burt Reynolds' more disturbing than any other character and the film was just average over all. I had heard about the sexual 'heinousness' of a particular scene involving Ned Beatty and of course the scene was humiliating for him but far from sexually deviant as the man is killed before he performs any travesties. Overall it was just an average adventure film with a decent story about a horrible experience than the friends work to cover up.Jon Voight plays Ed Gentry, the very soft spoken but strong member of the team. Voight's performance was decent but nothing stand out about it I didn't think. He was in the background most of the time defending Reynolds and never really did anything truly spectacular with the exception of the scene where he scales the rock wall to take out their would-be killer. Burt Reynolds was really the only stand out performance as boisterous, loud, and masculine Lewis Medlock who is the experience of their group. Medlock is firey and almost obsessively compulsive after he is forced to kill a man to save his friend. His performance is one of the best in the film. Ned Beatty plays the weaker and more manipulated Bobby Trippe who finds himself the worst of victims out of all of them. Beatty is very good in the role, especially given his usual comic performances but nothing stand out in his character either. Ronny Cox rounds out the foursome playing the voice of reason Drew Ballinger. A family man who finds himself in a situation he doesn't want to be in and causes him to almost break sanity at one point. Cox is very good and does a good job in his character and it was only unfortunate that he didn't get a bigger role. He also gets to take part in film history by performing the famous 'dueling banjos' scene at the very beginning of the film.I guess the artistic flavor of the film just goes over me. I don't see Deliverance as the dark and torturistic vision that it claims to be in history. I don't understand the guilt and fear that the men feel having killed a man who literally physically stalked and harmed them and was preparing to rape and kill them. No one in their right mind would have accused of them anything more than self protection and preservation. As stated before the story is good and the characters are watchable, I just wasn't blown away or mentally disturbed by the content of this film like so many people claim the film is. Still it is a classic and by right you must see it...the good news is the infamous dueling banjo's is almost right off the bat so you can get the joke any time any one hums the tune. 7/10 "},{"Title":"Backwoods bromance when Homer met Gomer...","Date":"2 July 2013","Score":"0 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Thriller","Review":" Before BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN or JEREMIAH'S JOHNSON, there was- DELIVERANCE. Like both BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN and JEREMIAH'S JOHNSON, DELIVERANCE is a backwoods bromance that was well ahead of its time. Four city slickers- the ever-so-Butch Burt Reynolds (who was a PLAYGIRL centerfold), Ronnie Cox (who sports the manliest monicker of them all), Ned Beatty, and Jon Voight- head into the mountains lookin' for Love. They find it when they run into some head-huntin' hillbillies, but not before they stop at a roadside zoo and Cox engages in a duet with a cute little in-bred porch monkey. They push on, stroking their way downriver until Beatty and Voight hook up with a couple of good ol' boys looking for a quick shotgun wedding. Beatty and one of the crackers engage in a bit of mountain man foreplay and are just about to consummate their relationship when they experience a bit of Burt Reynolds interruptus. The second cracker, who's tied Voight to a tree (we'll call this one Oddest Tool, because he not only looks like the cannibal necropheliac, but also sports only 5 teeth- 2 in his mouth and 3 in his pocket), parts company with them at this point. Later, he and Voight get together again, whereupon Oddest cries, Thou hast cleft my heart in twain! (That's from Willie Shakespears's OMELET, by the way.) In all seriousness, though, DELIVERANCE is a powerful piece of work and the performances to a man are award-worthy. The lament of the Burt Reynolds character echoes to this day. From James Dickey's novel The world is easily lost. Truer words were never spoken. "},{"Title":"Deliverance?

If you are going to make an action film that moves this slowly then make sure that your characters are interesting enough to carry the viewers attention. This film could really have explored it's characters much more than it did - there were lots of opportunities to find out what these guys thought about life and their current predicament but I never found anything out about these guys other than background details.Secondly the hillbillies were portrayed as stupid and/or bad and nothing else. They were just cardboard stereotypes, surely they could have been shown to have a few more facets to their character. Again it would have made the story more interesting.Thirdly Burt Reynolds acting was completely over the top in a superhero type way. I know he was supposed to play the macho outdoor type but when I saw him on the screen I kept on thinking of Adam West as Batman in the TV series. At least Adam West can use the excuse that he was playing a real superhero.The best bit for me was the duelling Banjos scene.

Dickey also wrote the screenplay, which explains a lot, especially if you are familiar with his 'poetry.' The actual look of the film, however, is sensational. The cinematography of nature, by Vilmos Zsigmond, is still stunning after thirty-five years- especially those scenes shot in twilight, dusk, and night, and the first forty-five or so minutes sets the basis of a good tale which could have been something really special. Then, Dickey digs into his own personal bag of fetishes (his most famous poem is The Sheep Child, about bestiality) and latencies and the film becomes an almost nonstop stream of a narrative propelled by the Dumbest Possible Action theory of film.Although the coinage of that term arrived a few years later than this film, Deliverance is as fine an example of that genre as there is. The term arrived in the early 1980s, when a spate of slasher films from the Halloween to the Nightmare On Elm Street to the Friday The 13th series, to their even cheaper knockoffs, were always dependent upon the early success of their villains stemming from the utter stupidity of their victims, to wit big breasted cheerleader is alone in a dark house, hears a scream from down an even darker hallway, yet rushes headlong toward the scream, all the while knowing that a serial killer is lurking about. In similar fashion, this film goes from a realistic portrayal of masculine mores to a silly, unrealistic, A to B to C pointless film. The turning point comes when one of the four male leads is sodomized forcefully by a hillbilly and his toothless gun-toting crony&#133;. the film finally founders because it lacks real situations, characters, and philosophy. After all, it's difficult to get truly philosophic after a character's been torpedoed by a hillbilly, and so a film that could have been a realistic and philosophic exploration of characters, and male character, devolves into a ridiculous melodrama of revenge, deceit, and perversion. Boorman is a noted filmmaker, but he's never been considered one of the great auteurs, and a film like Deliverance shows why. Some have accused me of gleeing in bad art. I don't. But needling the bad is a palliative over the depression bad art brings. This is especially true when a work of art could have been good, even great, but actively chooses to demean itself and its audience. This film proves that while James Dickey's body died in 1997, something far more essential died long before, or was never birthed; and in that I'm not talking about anything to do with morality. When you've figured out what that was, you'll understand Deliverance a whole lot better.

It's one of those movies that is always followed by a bad impersonation upon the mentioning of the title. Perhaps like Dirty Harry and 'Are you feeling lucky punk?'. I will try to avoid using the line 'Squeal like a pig' in this review, even though I just did. I should also mention that the film is also forever associated with the Duelling Banjos scene with just about every generation. But I must stress that those who often try to be clever by mimicking both these unique, little features have probably never even scene the film.Four naive city boys take a break from playing golf and decide to canoe down the Cahulawassee River before the valley is flooded into a huge reservoir. It's not their territory, but their leader Lewis Medlock (Burt Reynolds, looking like Steven Seagal's long-lost twin brother) arrogantly assumes that he can deal with any challenge that comes his way. His friends Ed, Bobby and Drew (Jon Voight, Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox) reluctantly follow him, despite having their own doubts.The first day of the trip goes fine, but on the second morning Ed and Bobby stop to rest by a small stream. There they are approached by a couple of disgusting mountain men, that are not quite as close to the mutants seen in Wrong Turn but are grotesque nonetheless. Despite their attempts at keeping the peace, the yokels strap Ed to a tree and force him to watch Bobby being raped. Even though I have never witnessed something like this, it's a horribly realistic scene and Ned Beatty does it very well, he must have some guts to do a such a scene in this; his first movie.Lewis shows up in the nick of time and kills one of the yokels but the other escapes. Drew is the only one who thinks that they should take the matters to the police and ends up having a sort of breakdown. In their attempts to escape the scene they crash the canoes and Lewis ends up with a nasty compound fracture. This leaves Ed as the only one capable of hunting down the remaining hillbilly who is preying upon them from the cliff-tops.It's a slow moving film that doesn't focus on the action so much as the horrors taking place in such a tranquil location. John Boorman's widescreen photography beautifully captures the Southern wilderness and comes across as rather haunting without resorting to cheap, slasher movie techniques. Boorman has spent half of his career on a high and the other half languishing in crappiness of Zardoz, Exorcist 2 and the horribly misjudged Excalibur. He has left a lasting impression filmmakers despite his failings.Deliverance is not for everyone and I certainly cannot recommend it to those who are only used to quick-fix MTV movies. But it is still a carefully measured, thought-provoking film.

Four city guys go on a canoe trip in the wilderness, and they run into trouble - real trouble as it turns out. It has a few things going for it. There's some spectacular scenery (it was shot on location in the Appalachian Mountains of northern Georgia), it has a pretty decent cast, headed by Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds and backed up by Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox, and it has the scene - a brutal, painful to watch scene that I'll speak more of in a moment. Still, I found this movie lacking. Almost an hour goes by with nothing really happening except watching these four guys on a canoe trip. Then, after the scene, while they're a more desperate bunch, it's largely the guys on the canoe trip again. Yes, there's a bit of suspense, and we don't really know what happened to Drew (Cox). The guys think they're being stalked (understandably) but that wasn't entirely clear. No doubt, though, they believed they were fighting for their lives. Still, just as the movie opens with little fanfare - little to draw the viewer in - it essentially fizzles out at the end.And yet, there was the scene - that brutal, painful scene I spoke of. After beaching their canoe, Bobby and Ed (Beatty and Voight) encounter two obviously inbred mountain men. The whole inbred mountain men thing was introduced at the beginning of the movie; it's a bit too cliché for me. The difference between these and other depictions of inbred mountain men is that these guys weren't cannibals - they were rapists. After tying Ed to a tree, they humiliate Bobby in every way possible - verbally, physically and ultimately sexually by raping him. I have to agree that this scene is disturbingly powerful and ugly even in 2010. By the standards of 1972 it's actually quite shocking that a scene of a man raping another man would even have been included.The problem here is that one scene - as powerful as it may be - and a bit of suspense afterward isn't enough to make up for an almost completely uneventful opening hour that does make you wonder if anything of interest is ever going to happen.

Lewis along with three friends, Ed Gentry (Jon Voight), Drew Ballinger (Ronny Cox) & Bobby Trippe (Ned Beatty) all travel down to the river & intend to canoe to a small town called Aintry at it's end where their cars will be waiting. However while en route Bobby & Ed stop off for a breather & are held at gunpoint by two local psychotic hillbillies (Bill McKinney & Herbert 'Cowboy' Coward) one of whom rapes Bobby up the bum, nice. Luckily Lewis & his trusty bow & arrows come to their rescue as he kills the rapist although the second hillbilly gets away, decisions need to be made as the men have to work out what to do with a dead body & the potential threat of more rapist hillbillies on the way...Produced & directed by John Boorman, originally Sam Peckinpah wanted to direct it but Boorman brought the rights to the novel before he had the chance & made Straw Dogs (1971) instead, & I have to say I was incredibly disappointed by what is regarded as some sort of classic. The script by James Dickey was based on his own novel of the same name & he also has a role in the film as the fat Sheriff at the end, personally I think it's far too slow, it's just too ambiguous & simply not enough happens over it's 110 odd minutes. The thing takes forever to get started, virtually nothing happens for 45 minutes at which point Bobby is made to squeal like a pig while raped in the films most notorious scene but it lasts for a few seconds isn't exploitative enough & not enough emphasis is put on it while after that the rest of the film is just the men canoing down the river before an incredibly long drawn out & throughly unnecessary ending which lasts for about 20 minutes too long. Deliverance might have been watchable if it had a bit of pace & had some sort of twist ending but it doesn't & in the end it isn't. This is an OK way to pass the time & you always have that feeling that something might happen although ultimately it never does. Then there's the scene with Drew just falling out of the canoe, the makers wanted the reasons behind this left to out imaginations but without knowing why he died or how you can't feel anything for him, well I didn't anyway.Director Boorman does alright even if the day-for-night shots are amongst the worst I've ever seen. I think it was a bad decision to completely sideline Lewis from the second half of the film, he was the only decent character in the whole thing until that point & we are left with the dull Ed & the squealing Bobby who gets over being ar*e raped quite quickly. Not much really happens & I never felt they were in that much danger either, as long as they followed the river they would be safe. Apparently Burt Reynolds broke his coccyx going down the rapids when his canoe capsized, now that's suffering for your art. The famous 'duelling banjos' scene (even though one is a guitar) was the very first scene shot & apparently the rest of Deliverance was shot almost entirely in sequence as it would appear on screen, amazing eh? Forget about any violence or gore as this is really rather tame.With a supposed budget of about $2,000,000 the production apparently wasn't insured to cut costs, a somewhat dangerous thing to do since Reynolds broke his leg. Deliverance was shot on the Chattooga River which divided Georgia & South Carolina, amazingly the following year apparently 31 people drowned trying to travel the stretch of river featured in the film, isn't that the stupidest thing you've ever heard? Serves them right I say. Anyway, it's well made with some nice 2351 scope location photography. The acting is strong from a good cast who all went on to achieve success in their own rights.Deliverance was a huge disappointment for me, it's watchable I suppose but it's just too boring & uneventful for me to really like it. I didn't find it exciting, disturbing or thrilling so there you have it, lots of people do seem to like it & that's fine with me but it's not anything I have any great fondness for.

What kind of people enjoy seeing stuff like that? That, and over a dozen abuses of the Lord's name in vain was enough for me at that point. It once again reminded me how sick some of the movies in the early 1970s were. What's really sick was that this film was a hit, at least with the critics who love evil people.The fact that rape scene was done just a couple of years after Hollywood ditched its moral codes probably made this movie more noteworthy than it deserved. Back then, it was a total shock. Nowadays, we've seen a lot worse and that scene wouldn't make this film as famous.Burt Reynolds, the star of the movie, however, is still playing sleazy roles today. Some things never change. At least Jon Voight has gone on to some classier roles and Beatty has proved he has comedic talent as well as being a good dramatic actor. To be fair about it, if disturbing stories don't bother you, or if you are not titillated by sexual-deviant scenes and just appreciate a film for its acting or its photography or its suspenseful, entertaining story fine, because this film offers all of the above. It also will leave you emotionally worn out and you certainly will empathize with Voight's character at the end.To me, however, this film may have all the above, plus a fine director in John Boorman (see The Emerald Forest), but I found it just too depressing and sordid. There is a definite audience for depressing stories, but I am not in that group. Also, you have to care about the characters to some degree. I couldn't find myself doing that in here.

Because of its age, it's pretty much inevitable that it would be hyped up to oblivion by all the self-proclaimed film experts, but that's to be understood. When you're at a formal dinner, sipping fine wine, saying 300 is your favorite movie is going to get you awkwardly stared in the same way a kindergartener would get stared at if he said he was wearing underwear with Isaac Newton on them, not Dora the Explorer (or whatever kids watch these days). In that situation, it's best to say something from the 70s because, by God, every movie from the 70s is gold and everything from the 2000s is crap. It's understandable. But what I don't understand is how Deliverance can be so acclaimed within the casual crowd. I simply can't picture either a teenage kid listening to screamo or a middle aged man who's cheating on his wife finding enjoyment in Deliverance. It's the positive reviews from those people that disturb me. In fact, I'm going as far as to say the amount of positive reviews from the casual crowd disturbs me infinitely beyond that of the supposed brutal content of this movie.I'm a sap for slow-build movies. If you can grab my attention with a slow, atmospheric buildup, I'll be just as interested as if you bashed me in the balls with a god-awesome action scene. Deliverance knows how to do an effective slow build flawlessly. For the first hour I so interested in Deliverance I thought to myself This movie could do absolutely nothing to earn a bad score. Nothing. The buildup involved very well shot scenes of extreme canoeing, and the naturalist part of my mind was ready to have an orgasm from the awesomeness. (Okay, okay. Maybe I'm exaggerating a little for the melodramatic effect of my next sentence.) So there I am, on the edge of nirvana, and&#151;BOOM!&#151;out of nowhere the cliché conflict hits the plot and every good thing I had to say about this film went to hell. Not because the conflict was disturbing or gave me, the viewer, the feeling of desperation, but because it was so cliché. As I said, the movie is about nothing but four guys going canoeing who would have guessed something bad is going to happen to them? Really? As if I didn't see that coming. I just wish for once a movie would be realistic or edgy enough to have NOTHING bad happen to the characters. At least then it wouldn't be so ungodly predictable. You say, But if that happened, then there wouldn't be a plot! And you'd be right. But you're forgetting one small detail Deliverance had no plot to begin with. Four guys go canoeing and something bad happens . . . is as much of a plot as, Four guys go to Wal-Mart and they can't find the brand of toothpaste they wanted . . . So how can you argue with me when I say Deliverance would have been better if it had just stuck with the buildup, rather than add some cliché bad situation into the mix? At least that way it would have at least had entertainment value, and sacrificed nothing the actual movie has now except a few clichés.Without spoiling anything, the oh-so-bad events that happen aren't even that bad. The scene that seems to upset everyone was really almost comical. I actually laughed. The bad events all generic for 70s films. You've seen one 70s walking-down-the-street-and-then-bad-stuff-happens film, you've seen them all. They do nothing but copy Straw Dogs or A Clockwork Orange, or copy each other, and then they get acclaimed for being so original. It's ludicrous. There is nothing original about Deliverance, nor is there anything disturbing about it. It's typical in every single aspect. And if there is a moral point, I missed it because it was so cliché I couldn't tell it apart from the countless other clichés. What is the point of watching a movie for the moral point if it has no impact on your life or how you think? The only sole good thing I can even say about Deliverance is that it does have some very good directing scattered throughout. There are one or two scenes that are really some of the most effective nature shots in cinema history. But they last a whopping 20 seconds, and then the movie is back to its boring clichés and predictable story, so they're not worth watching the film for.Really, there isn't anything in Deliverance that makes it worth watching whatsoever. I've seen countless reviews use the term this film insults my intelligence because of some plot twist they were too dumb to see coming in modern movies. But here I am to use it against them Deliverance insulted its own intelligence. It started off with perfection, then it collapsed in on itself because the director thought he needed to insert some cliché plot/moral to be literary. He failed to have the intelligence to understand literary isn't always best.

As they travel down the river, they wage war against two sadistic hillbillies, whose simple-minded and criminally stereotypical goals are best unmentioned in this review.  Frankly, the entirety of the film is nothing more than fluff to embellish around a single disturbing act.  The morals surrounding the characters' actions, concerning death and the law, are addressed minimally and tossed aside after five minutes of trite dialogue.  This movie is incomplete in every aspect and should be branded as no less than unsatisfying and bizarre.Theme Nature is fundamentally incompatible with The System.  Wilderness is best left undisturbed. "}{"Title":"One of the most overrated films of all time","Date":"11 January 2009","Score":"8 out of 43 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Drama, Thriller","Review":" Review Deliverance is a completely overrated and ignorant film that persuades audiences into thinking of watching a scary and memorable horror/thriller film. Instead all Deliverance offers into is a ballsy, incomplete and even overlong film that sets little frights.The direction and acting is under par and definitely feels incomplete. Boorman tries more on the direction than on the acting which unbalances the film greatly.Verdict A harrowing and shallow film that should have seen the end of Boormans career. "}]
