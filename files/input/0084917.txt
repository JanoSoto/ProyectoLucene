When the film came out I was crass about how much was omitted or changed or embellished. But then, several years later, I watched it again. I was amazed at how many of the unknown actors I'd seen before had become huge Hollywood staples (John Lithgow's amazing performance, Glenn Close, Robin Williams, Hume & Jessica, Mary Beth Hurt, the wonderful Swoosie Kurtz, the godess Amanda Plummer,and even a cameo from John Irving himself!). This film is alive with brilliant talent. And let's not forget the music as well. From the opening score of the Beatles, WHEN I'M 64 to the closing sounds of the helicopter, this films sountrack alone is worth drawing attention - simple, honest, pure.There is magic in this film that makes it a timeless, yet period piece.If the viewer compares it to the novel, there may be disappointment or disapproval.

Robin Williams almost plays it down, but thoroughly shines in the title role as T.S.Garp in this, his first proper feature film(well you can hardly include 'Popeye' in that category!).This is an amazingly rare look at a story that evolves around happiness, sadness, heartbreak, love, and all the other natural emotions that this young,up and coming novelist experiences throughout his far from normal existence that culminates in a dark satire on many comical situations.Some great moments to be had including a great performance from John Lithgow as the transsexual ex-football player who befriends Garp and his Worldly renowned Women's lib Mother played brilliantly by Glenn Close in her film debut.You'll laugh... especially at the way Garp was conceived and to find out what his initials T.S. actually stand for. You'll rejoice... at the moment when Garp finds out he is to become a father for the first time. You'll cry...many times...This movie has got to be one of the most underrated masterpieces of the 1980's, and in many ways sustains a cult following as being one of Robin Williams' first major movie projects.

The film spans nearly forty years and requires the actors to not only age four decades, but to emote four decades of their respective character's development. All involved do this astonishingly well, especially Robin Williams in his first dramatic part, and Glenn Close, who plays his mother despite actually being younger than Williams. Even the film itself grows in character - it starts in our own world, and then rapidly snowballs into a world wildly different from our own, but not unbeleivably different.Close plays Jenny Fields, a woman who grows from being oddly independent to becoming the symbol of ultra-feminism over the next 30 years. She sets a world-changing series of events into place with the unorthodox conception of her son whom she names T.S. Garp after his father, Technical Sergeant Garp. The boy (known simply as Garp) is brought up in the fifties and sixties as the only child of a single mother - unheard of in those days. This unique childhood gives Garp an unusual view of the world, which inspires him ot become a writer. As the young Garp struggles to become a writer, his mother (inspired by his writings and her own warped world view) also decides to be a writer. Her first and only book,Sexual Suspect, is a radical feminist manifesto and becomes an instant bestseller in the already unstable and turbulent 1960s...as if Garp's life wasn't wierd enough.It gets wierder still as Garp courts and married his college sweetheart, becomes an author in his own right, and raises a family. Garp's own family life is quite normal with it's rewards, fights, wonders and tragedies, but it is played against the backdrop of a world wildly twisted in it's values by his own mother. Meanwhile, his mother has created a home for women who are unable to integrate into society - probably as a result of having read Sexual Suspect. At the home, Garp makes several new aquaintences. Among them are the twisted Ellen Jamesians, women who have cut off their tongues in protest of the rape of a young girl named Ellen James - and Roberta Muldoon, a transsexual former tight end for the Philadelphia Eagles struggling with being a hopeless romantic in a male chauvanist world.If there is a message in The World According to Garp, it might be that the world is a strange and wonderful place filled with both horror and delight. Garp's world makes you look at your own and realize how wierd it really is, and makes you appreciate the delights of your world a little more.Glenn Close, Robin Williams, and Mary Beth Hurt (who plays Mrs. T.S. Garp) are all outstanding in their ability to create likeable characters, and to mellow and age them convincingly. The other standout role is John Lithgow, who plays Roberta Muldoon with touching hilarity and beleivability. There are no bad performances in this film it is populated with characters that are as solid and quirky as those in real life. The only flaws in the film are that the second act has some draggy slow parts, and there is one gag involving an airplane that tries a little hard for laughs.In an alternate universe, The World According to Garp might be a biographical documentary. It creates a world that is somehow familiar and completely distorted at the same time.

To be honest, I have never read John Irving's book. Although I probably will one day, I enjoy the movie too much and right now I don't want my perception of it altered. Beautifully acted, written, and photographed, Garp just moves me everytime I watch it. To this day, I haven't seen Robin Williams or Glenn Close play better roles than they do here, and John Lithgow is just a hoot as Roberta. Back to the bittersweet thing, I love the way this film will have you moved to tears one minute and laughing the next, just like real life.

From feminism exploitation to marital infidelity to gender-alteration, we witness the undoing of the principal characters through acts of selfishness, greed, and sheer loneliness.This movie, however, will not appeal to the typical moviegoer, but rather to one who enjoys volatile, politically incorrect subject matter from a psychological perspective. Garp toys with your mind, soul, and heart from beginning to end, and its twisted humor remains as gripping as its dreadful tragedies.Indeed, Garp is not for the faint of heart, but ironically, heart is what the movie ultimately delivers.

Like life itself.","Date":"18 May 2008","Score":"7 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" The World According to Garp is an unconventional film, to say the least. Not so much in the sense of how it looks, or how it is acted. More than anything the film stands out because it is a human drama that doesn't take a stance or one particular point of view. T. S. Garp is simply a man trying to live his life amongst all manner of eccentric characters and unlikely situations. And like life, things happen. People grow old. There are moments of joy. There are moments of tragedy. And people die.Robin Williams plays the title character known by most as simply Garp. His mother, played with dignified enthusiasm by Glenn Close, has brought him up all by herself. She is a nurse and during WWII, she used the sperm of a dying tail gunner who she happened to be caring for in his final moments. To call this woman a feminist would be a magnificent understatement. Her sexuality is never made that clear to the viewer but is is inferred by some around her that she is in fact a lesbian. Her only relationship with a man that we learn of is the encounter that produced her son, and she spends much of the film condemning the lusty ways of men and boys. As the film goes on, she becomes a famous writer and feminist leader. Garp spends much of his life trying to be a successful writer himself and raising a family, but he never seems to escape his mother's shadow.The plot simply follows the life of Garp and his family members. A great many things happen to these people over the span of many years. Careers are made, children are born, affairs are had, and the joys of life are often shattered by terrible tragedies. Williams is decent enough as Garp. He maybe acts a bit too zany in the light-hearted scenes, but he nails the more dramatic ones pretty well. That's the amazing thing about Robin Williams. The guy is an absolute nut most of the time he's in front of a camera, but when he bears down and plays something serious, it's stunning to see how great his range can be. He is an undervalued actor. Glenn Close steals this film though in terms of acting. She owns every scene she's in much like how her domineering character towers over that of her son's. The supporting cast is more than adequate with John Lithgow getting major props for his daring turn as a transsexual with a heart of gold. The film seems to take its share of jabs at radical feminism as it depicts a sect of women knows as the Ellen Jamsians. These women cut out their own tongues to protest the similar fate of a rape victim. And boy do these ladies HATE men. An act of violence in one of the final scenes shows how fanatical they can be. (as if cutting out their tongues wasn't bad enough!) Each person who views this film will probably see something different in it, and those are my favorite kinds of films. There are moments of definite humor, surprise, hope, and tragedy. You will not be bored. The film is based on a popular novel by John Irving and is worth 9 of 10 stars.The Hound.

Robin Williams is a fine Garp, Glenn Close is absolutely perfect as Jenny Garp (her performance was one of the few times I've seen the exact character I'd pictured in my head when I read the book up on the screen), and John Lithgow is funny and touching as transsexual Roberta Muldoon.

Me, I was still awestruckfrom having recently seen Escape From New York, (which I stillconsider a really good film taking into account the time frame & genre).As I recall I didn't put up a great deal of resistance, after all withMork playing the title role how bad could it be? Little did I knowthat I was about to see the first film that I would come to considertruly timeless.With all this in mind I may be somewhat biased when I say that this ismore than a film, to me it's a work of art. It probably wasn't the firstartistically driven film I'd seen, but it must have been the first onethat I was old enough to understand and fully appreciate. All I know isthat I left the theater that night intent on broadening my cinematichorizons. At the time I had no concept of the significance of the Academy AwardNominations that would follow. Now I look back and I'm stunned that onlytwo portions of this wonderful work were deemed worthy of OscarNominations. Glenn Close received acclaim with a Best Supporting Actress Nominationfor her portrayal of the single mother of T. S. Garp, (Robin Williams).In spite of her son's literary aspirations, she becomes a novelist oficonic proportions, she is more than a little eccentric but a lovingmother never the less. John Lithgow was the other nominee for BestSupporting Actor, and was phenomenal in his role as an, ex-NFL tight endwho has become an emotionally frustrated transsexual and close familyfriend. This is one of those rare movies that I've seen time and time again overthe years, and it never seems lose any of the rare qualities thatdazzled me from the start. Needless to say it gave me a completely newoutlook on the seemingly limitless abilities of Robin Williams. For meit's virtually impossible to nail down a specific, or even a dominantgenre where this flick is concerned.

It's a quirky, goofy and bittersweet string of sketches, attempting to explain a man's growth from birth to adulthood and how he deals with the vices of lust and fanaticism that surround him. Garp is born to a formidable unmarried mother, Jenny Fields, played by Glenn Close.(The various stages of Garp's childhood are played by three young actors before Robin Williams takes over as Garp reaches adulthood.) The story follows him through childhood at a boys' prep school, where Jenny is the school nurse, through his high school passions-wrestling,writing,and sex-to marriage with his high school sweetheart, children, marital problems and a writing career. Jenny meanwhile has become a famous feminist , espousing an unorthodox cause. The plot details an abundance of comic and tragicomic episodes and outlandish adventures. Williams gives a cherub-faced performance. This script was not fitting for his wildness and anarchy and thus his talent was wasted. He's like an injured bird sputtering out of control. John Lithgow's role as a father like transsexual, imparting wisdom, also doesn't make sense. This movie was able to attract some reasonable attention in 1982, due to the popularity of Robin Williams and his new entry into movies. Williams had recently shed his Mork and Mindy pursuits and focused more on stand-up comedy and movies. Audiences were confused by this film, especially by its arbitrary and inexplicable ending.

Was this act of low professional ethics an accepted policy in the nurse's handbook? Question #2 - Am I the only one who thinks it's really screwy that after a woman has done such a thing (as mentioned above) that she then go around boasting about it, even to her parents, as well as talking about it in the presence of the son who was conceived this way? Question #3 - And would you deem it deranged and hypocritical for this very same woman to be calling adolescent boys sick for looking at girlie magazines (?) - As well as disapproving of her own son's interest in women? Question #4 - Is it alright for this very same woman to write a book clearly encouraging other women to literally defecate on men as a means of gaining female empowerment and that way reduce men to the lowest position of being the absolute scum of the earth? Question #5 - Am I mistaken, or did this movie send me a clear message, telling me that no man is any good unless he becomes a transsexual (?) - As well as telling me that it's only women who've got the capacity to truly love their children?

You know, after watching this film with its decidedly gender-confused storyline, I honestly find myself unable to determine whether novelist, John Irving was, himself, a true man-hater at heart, or just a nasty, little woman-hater. I'd say that he was, very much, a lot of both.But regardless of how I interpret Garp's story, I think this film was a really demented tale that made Feminism appear to be absolutely despicable.

I saw it on dollar night and wanted my money back. This is possibly the most offensive piece of work I have ever had the misfortune to sit through.The story centers around Garp (Robin Williams), the bastard son of Jenny Fields (Glenn Close), as he is referred to so often throughout the film that the viewer is as annoyed by the phrase as he is. Jenny, a sex-hating and man-hating woman, conceives Garp when she is an army nurse caring for a patient with a head wound who sports an enormous erection, of which Jenny takes advantage. Garp is apparently the only sound the poor man can make, and so she decides to name the baby that. In the opening scene of the film, Jenny tells her parents this in excruciating detail. Despite the fact that child is a boy, she does lavish a great deal of love on him, and he grows up to be a writer. His life path deals with love, infidelity, the loss of a child in perhaps the most bizarre accidents in film history - one that causes the castration of another character, and his own frustrations in being overshadowed by his mother, who becomes famous when she writes a book about her experiences. Jenny becomes the center of a movement of women who seem to have a capacity for hatred that exceeds even hers. Ultimately, this leads to her assassination, and a funeral from which her son is barred merely because he is male (never mind that he's actually family and grieving his own loss). An old childhood enemy recognizes him at the service, and blows him in. The same enemy shows up at the end of the movie and shoots him - pointless violence to end a pointless movie.Admittedly, I don't have the sensibilities to enjoy this film, but I think that is its biggest failing. I have been told time and time again that I would appreciate the movie more if I read the book. Why should I have to read the book? The movie should stand on its own in telling the story. This one doesn't. Motives are undefined. Explanations of illogical behavior are not forthcoming. Little makes sense, either in the world according to Garp, or in the world at large. And much that might be humorous simply isn't because of the way it is presented.Given the star power in the movie, the acting is quite disappointing. Glenn Close is unpleasant, as usual, but unfortunately for her, this is a character that needs a softness that she is completely unable to give. Jenny as Close plays her, is merely obnoxious. Jenny in the hands of a better actress could be a woman you loved to hate, or vice versa. Williams' portrayal fares little better, although at least we understand his emotions and his actions as a result of them - insofar as he understood them, and it's not always apparent that he did. Mary Beth Hurt does a nice job with Helen, providing one of the few likable characters in the course of the movie. John Lithgow is a scene stealer in the role of a post operative trans-gendered woman, and deserved the acclaim he got for the role. Brenda Currin as Pooh is merely an irritating plot device, as she gives no depth to the character, and no explanation for Pooh's actions (unless you are to believe she's merely insane, and that doesn't seem to be what is indicated).Ultimately I found the movie to be a disappointing waste of time. Perhaps reading the book would have been better, but I was so soured on the story after sitting through the movie, that the book holds no appeal at all now. Which says a lot about just how bad this movie is.

Helmed by a steely woman, who had a son out of wedlock, it showcases how mother and son named Garp live out their lives, always remaining true to themselves.The mother, going by the moniker Jenny Fields and played by Glenn Close, was a really remarkable woman. She conceived her child ALMOST by artificial insemination (it was a close call), she raised him by herself, she wrote a bestseller denouncing sex and with money gleaned from that, she opened a half-way house for women with psychological needs and social issues.On hindsight, she was a woman who was just beginning to break the shackles of society that dictated female rights, especially in those heady times when women were beginning to discover their self-worth. I didn't know how to label her as I was watching the movie, feminist, social worker, philanthropist, weird? But yet, she did not hate men or humanity, rather it was men who couldn't accept her, except her son of course. I say, she is fiercely independent and a leader in her own right.And as for Garp (who was played by Robbie Williams), he loves writing too, but his stories are always terribly sad, and yet he is so upbeat in person. Oxymoron? or philosophical follower? Strongly attached to his family, he can be said to be a family man although infidelity (won't say who!) threatens to rock it.

"},{"Title":"What the hell was all that about?","Date":"4 December 2009","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" The relationship between the cinema and the novels of John Irving has not always been a happy one. I still am amazed at how a book as good as A Prayer for Owen Meany was turned into a film as bad as Simon Birch. Irving himself wrote the script for The Cider House Rules, but even he could not prevent Lasse Hallstrom from performing his normal trick of turning everything he touches into the purest treacle. Tony Richardson's The Hotel New Hampshire is rather better, but still not as good as it could have been given its stellar cast and literary source.One of the problems with adapting Irving for the screen may be that his plots are complex ones packed with bizarre happenings and eccentric characters, the sort of plots that need all his writer's skill to turn them into coherent novels. When these plots are translated to the screen they can often seem like little more than a catalogue of unrelated incidents. The makers of Simon Birch were clearly aware of this problem as they removed much of the content of the novel, but in so doing they ended up also removed most of its significance. Another problem is that Irving's novels are often set over lengthy periods of time, thus presenting difficulties with ageing the characters. Here Glenn Close plays Garp's mother, throughout the film, even though she is only four years older than Robin Williams, who plays Garp as an adult. Williams too, 31 at the time, was not very convincing in the scenes where he plays a young student.I have never read Irving's The World According to Garp, so I do not approach this film in a spirit of it can never be as good as the book. Nevertheless, it seems to me to exemplify the adage that one should never judge a book by its cover nor a film by the big names in its title sequence. I have enjoyed what I have read of Irving's writing, especially Owen Meany. After seeing films like Dead Poets Society, Good Morning Vietnam and Mrs Doubtfire, Robin Williams is one of my favourite actors. George Roy Hill directed another of my favourite films, The Sting, and made some more very good ones such as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and The Great Waldo Pepper. I was therefore expecting to enjoy this film more than I actually did.The film chronicles the life of the writer T. S. Garp. (We never discover exactly what his initials stand for; even as a boy he is always referred to as Garp). It follows him though his childhood, his college days, his literary career and his marriage to his sweetheart Helen. An important influence on his life is his eccentric mother Jenny Fields who follows her son into the literary line, becoming a feminist heroine after publishing her autobiography. Despite her feminist leanings, Jenny is something of a puritan when it comes to sex; she inveighs against lust with all the passion of a fire-and-brimstone preacher. She herself has only ever had one sexual experience in her life. When she was an Army nurse she had intercourse with Garp's father, even though he was comatose at the time, thus making her one of the few female rapists in cinematic history.This was Williams' second film (after Popeye), and he is reasonably good as the main character, although this is not one of his really great films. I was not, however, greatly impressed with the rest of the cast. Someone obviously liked John Lithgow as Garp's transvestite friend Roberta (nee Robert) Muldoon, as he received a Best Supporting Actor nomination, but I found his performance frankly embarrassing. (This film must have caused some amusement in New Zealand. The Prime Minister of that country in 1982 was named Robert Muldoon).Glenn Close can be a very good actress, as she was in Fatal Attraction, but she never really succeeded in bringing Jenny to life; indeed, I was never sure whether Jenny is supposed to be a sympathetic character or an unsympathetic one. Indeed, I was never sure what line the film was supposed to be taking on feminism. At times it seemed like a satire on the excesses of the feminist movement, symbolised here by the Ellen Jamesians, women who have cut out their tongues in protest against male violence against women. At other times, however, Jenny is presented as an inspirational figure who has brought hope to the women of America, although we never find out exactly what was in her book to make her such an icon.Another problem with the film is that it is not always clear what is going on. A car crash plays an important part in the plot, but it is not immediately obvious which characters have died and which have survived. (To judge by some of the posts on here, some viewers were left baffled even at the end of the film). Towards the end of the film two characters are assassinated, without it ever being made clear why. No doubt these things might be clearer to those who have read the book, but a film based on a novel ought to make sense in its own right, even to those who have not read the literary source There are some good scenes in The World According to Garp, but overall it is the sort of film that leaves you with the feeling What the hell was that all about? 5/10 "},{"Title":"classic George Roy Hill","Date":"6 January 2003","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  From the first time I saw Garp I was enthralled by the depth of quality in every aspect, but just tonight I realised that the same director, George Roy Hill had also made two of my all time favourite films - Slaughterhouse Five and Thoroughly Modern Millie.I love the strength and individuality of the characters in all of these films, which combine with impeccable soundtrack music selection and editing so smooth that you can bathe in the sheer artistry.

Calling this movie 'a mixed bag' is an understatement; it careens wide-eyed through a tempest of different emotions and tones, but the fundamental weakness is that we never get close to these people. Robin Williams gives a solid lead performance (one of his first critically-acclaimed 'grown up' roles that took many by surprise), and Glenn Close has an amazing presence as mother Jenny (it's a one-note role without much shading, though Close almost overcomes that). Still, the filmmakers observe these characters almost clinically, and so they remain aloof from us. John Lithgow's performance as a transsexual is probably the warmest, and Amanda Plummer has amazing intensity in just one small scene. The queasy tendency to lump together sexual matters and bloodshed is more disturbing than darkly comic, and the finale is fancifully pointless--as if the whole film were a shaggy-dog story. ** from **** "},{"Title":"A long journey through life...","Date":"1 January 2016","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" While The World According to Garp is a nice movie, it is not quite as memorable as I would have expected. I haven't read the Irving novel, so I don't know how true to the book the film version is.The story follows Garp from his birth up to adulthood and parenthood, and it follows all those in his life and family. There are too many events to go through, so it is better to say that you should watch the entire movie, because a synopsis hardly do the entire story justice.Despite being from 1982, then the movie still holds its own today and can be watched every now and then with some years passing.What makes The World According to Garp good is the cast ensemble and the very impressive performances they all deliver. In the lead role as Garp is Robin Williams, who handled a serious role quite well. Playing his mother Jenny was Glenn Close, and she really brought something solid to the movie. But most impressive was John Lithgow in the role of a post-op transsexual NFL player. Lithgow was amazing in this movie. Mary Beth Hurt playing Garp's wife Helen also did a good job with her character.The movie runs a bit over two hours, which was starting to get a bit strained at times.

The characters, scenes, mishaps, joys, and dramas are very well picked out and very well balanced. Moreover, I think Garp is a sort of one-of-a-kind-movie, different than other movies in this genre -- but what genre is it actually? It's black, it's comedy, it's drama, but it's also absurd and somehow unreal, even a bit over-fictional. But it still 'works' and one can easily relate to all the things Garp and his friends/relatives are going through. It's vivid, fast, intimate, daring, and full of twists and turns and so well played.

Or, What, no death by hanging?","Date":"14 October 2015","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" Many others have commented on the John Irving novel that this film is supposed to be based upon. I haven't read the book, but how true this movie is to the source doesn't matter in critiquing the film itself. The World According to Garp is a hodgepodge of events in the life of the main character, Garp, played by Robin Williams. Others saw some good performances in the film, but it's hard to pin down characters with this script, the directing and film editing. The film bounces all over the place with little cohesion. An example is in Garp's character who gets emotional over his mom's death (Jenny Fields played by Glenn Close). But earlier, when his youngest son Walter is killed in a car accident in which everyone else is hurt, the film skips right over it. There's one reference to Walter's being gone between Garp and his wife, Helen, played by Mary Beth Hurt. But no signs of emotion from either one. That's where there should have been a real outpouring of grief by both parents. Anyone who knows anything about life realizes that children are not supposed to die before their parents. So, it's hard for this viewer to believe the sincerity of emotion Williams shows at times. The notion of the actor trying to portray a feeling seems to hang over those scenes. Others noted that Close's character seems aloof much of the time. She often seems to have something else on her mind. She's mater-of-fact in everything she does. So, there's no warmth or life to her character. John Lithgow as the trans-gender Roberta probably gives the best performance, but it's not exceptional. The rest of the characters are fair in their roles. At one point in the film, the Clue board game came to mind. There were so many different mishaps and tragedies happening, it seemed like a catalog for a board game. It has rape (female of a male no less), murder, sex, car death, attempted suicide, male and female nudity, shootings, adultery, sex change, self-mutilation, prostitution, solicitation (by a mother for her son yet), an airplane crash, road rage, and several near accidents. All this in a film that is supposed to be first, a comedy. I'm surprised that there wasn't an abortion, to go along with the rest of the humor. Others have noted the incoherence of this film. I suspect that the number of things that qualify this as an R-rated film would turn many viewers away. I can laugh at good film efforts to poke fun at serious subjects. But this isn't a good effort, and it can't be considered a spoof with all its aberrations. For instance, two shooting instances to kill people are hardly good fodder for laughs. And, what do they spoof? The best that can be said about The World According to Garp is that it has some nice camera shots of New England coastal scenes. "},{"Title":"Whatever you expect, you'll be surprised ...","Date":"29 April 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" Adapted from John Irving's best seller, The World According to Garp is one of the strangest movie I've ever had to see, I guess I mean it as a compliment although I didn't put my expectations very high. The film starts with Jenny Fields, Glenn Close as the central character, she's the caring and loving mother of Garp, but it's only until we hear the context of his conception that we realize the child was promised to a very peculiar destiny.Should I describe how Garp was born? This is one of the film's many surprises that pop up between two or three 'normal' scenes. But the intriguing parts are indeed so intriguing that we tend to believe this Garp is exceptional, a sort of autistic child floating within his own reverie. The film starts with a memorable animated sequence featuring Garp with his unknown father, a jet-pilot during WWII who died before he was born. While both father and son are fighting in the air a monster-like death, the surrealistic sequence brings some poetry to the movie, illustrating the capacity of a child to conceal hidden wounds through imagination. This is one of the inspirational messages I could relate to  inspiration and imagination do exorcise inner demons, especially during childhood.Then, when the young Garp turns out to be a wannabe writer, I'm not surprised, but the fact that he is a normal kind of disappoints me. I didn't know what to expect either, with this misleading shot of Robin Williams smiling at the sky. Finally, I'm glad he was a rather nice and serious guy, I don't think I could have endured the typical Robin Williams for two hours. Maybe it's the title that misled me, referring to the world rather than Garp, it's not even the world from his perspective, but simply the world that revolves around him. Garp is not a passive person although he has one characteristic that undermines his freedom of acts, the mother's influence. Glenn Close plays a strong-willed, independent nurse, with an ambiguous relationship with her son, angry when he lusts toward his future wife, played by Mary Beth Hurt, and eager to follow him to discover the world. She's supportive and caring but maybe a bit too much.And when Garp decides to become a writer, his turning point strangely coincides with his mother's. Since nothing special happened to him so far, he writes about his mother, what she totally disapproves stating that only she has the right to write about herself. Then Garp becomes a fictional writer, specializing on short stories, and Jenny writes a feminist manifesto based on her own experience and titled Sexual Suspects. Inspired from her own experience and many encounters in the big city, Jenny became a political phenomenon, a cult idol, while Garp, less successful but more critically praised can only resign to the satisfaction of being a writer, and at least, being as successful as a family man. After all, who can complain about accomplishing a personal dream and being able to live through it? And it's at that point that no matter how disjointed and peculiar some scenes were, I was immersed in the story of Garp following the little world of so many memorable characters. Those who stick to mind are Roberta, an ex-football athlete who became a woman John Lithgow is absolutely remarkable, beyond believability, what starts as a gag turns out to be a poignant and sweet performance, Roberta is immediately accepted by the family, by Garp, and Lithgow has such a way to play it, we never feel it unrealistic. There is also 'Poo', the sister of Garp's childhood love-life, a jealous mute girl characterized by big horn-rimmed glasses and an incapability to smile, to life and in general , the closest figure to an antagonist, her appearances suggest a misfortune to happen, but the film is so full of them that we're never really off-guard and always expect a disaster to happen.There is also a very interesting sub-story involving a group of feminist who called themselves, the Ellen Jamesians in homage to Ellen James, a young girl who was not only raped, but had her tongue cut-off by her rapists so she wouldn't give her names. To Garp's big shock, the feminist voluntarily cut their tongue, An act of desperate unison rather than self-mutilation, but the way Garp perceives it, these women are dangerous. Never judgmental, the film allows us to make up our own opinions ,adultery is also a recurrent theme, and the victims are not innocent. The film is a chronicle of things happening, and connecting to each other, for the best and sometimes for the worse, and for a worse that can be devastating or hilarious. George Roy Hill's direction, either deliberately or not, use a lot of suspense without forcing.And oddly enough, it's because we feel bad omens and sad events that were grabbed to the story and enjoy the little moments of joy and tenderness. The movie teases our emotions but never forcing them, it also never patronizes us, but it's full of some insights. It kind of reminded me of Forrest Gump without the Pop-culture thing, a sort of picaresque journey within one's own world, indeed The World according to Garp. Robin Williams delivers one of his best performances, in all nuance and sobriety, while it's Glenn Close and John Lithgow who steal the show.And still, I feel I have to watch it again &#x85; the film is one strange adventure into life that deserves probably more than one viewing, I'm not sure I will find more answers, but there are some characters' motives that are still mysterious to me, and The World According to Garp is definitely worthy for more recognition.

Not only were they shocked at the nudity, sexual situations and language, they found the movie boring and not-so-funny.What was funny, was that when they showed a woman's breasts, they covered my eyes yet leaving them wide open for the guy's locker room that, pretty much, showed everything. Heh, little did they know.Probably not so strange, those were the main two scenes/memories I can recall from when I was eight and seeing this the first time. Obviously, the rest of the movie didn't leave too much of an impact, despite seeing myself in the role of Young Garp since we were relatively the same age. I guess I was either bored or concentrated too far on what I saw openly or through my parent's hand.Beyond the Rated-R Content had they known what a deep, long and melodramatic film this was, I'm sure I would've been sent off to see either The Secret of Nimh or Tron. Heck, I would've loved to see Raiders of the Lost Ark's reissue as I don't recall seeing that in the theatres. My guess, they would've vetoed The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.Fast forward. Present Day, also Arizona. I just watched it again, only for the second time, upon a friend's recommendation.

Sure, the movie's main character is, in fact, Garp, but I got the feeling this is really Nurse Jenny's movie. And Close did a FANTASTIC job as the strict, but free-spirited, WOMAN-FIRST single mother, something simply unheard of in the 1940s and on through Garp, her only child's life.Sure, Jenny was a tad bit controlling and had wild ideas about how sex was bad, lust worse and men suck, but Close showed such incredible depth that I would loved to get to know her in real life. That is, if her men-hating groupies (today they would be militant-lesbians, and perhaps some of these were) would let me near her.The character Garp does feel throughout that he's taking a backseat to his mother, and after watching the movie, I'd have to agree. If only he'd saw the whole picture, or at least opened his eyes and stop trying to one-up her, there might have been an alternative ending.Basically, the movie follows baby Garp from birth (and in the air) through fatherhood in various stopping points of his life. His likes wrestling and writing, his lusts a childhood crush, a younger babysitter and a prostitute and his love Helen. All throughout, his mother stays close as both his mother and friend.That's the basic premise of the story, but you will need to watch it for the more depth given, the sly jokes the toned down Williams utters, and the friendships made such as the wonderful Roberta Muldoon played by John Lithgow.You'll fall in love with Roberta, probably the only completely loyal and sane character in the entire movie. And yet will probably be judged the harshest &#x96; especially in 1982 &#x96; for being a transvestite ex-football player.And speaking of which, that's one of the best qualities of this movie. Even though it was set from the 1940s to decades later, it still came out in 1982 and broached some touchy and tough subjects, both of which I thoroughly admire the filmmakers, writers, director, etc, for taking. This includes, but not inclusive of woman's movements & rights, single mother parenting, transvestites &#x96; including acceptance and fights on both sides &#x96; SEE Garp's final book.This is not all to say this was a perfect movie. Though it did pull some emotions out of me, and certainly made me laugh in spots &#x96; namely from Williams very low humor, it had enormous pacing problems injunction with being just too long and it was thoroughly over-dramatic in spots to the point where almost each and every scene as the movie progressed, I felt something REALLY bad was going to happen. That got annoying after awhile due to it taking away some of the pleasures of watching and enjoying what was on the screen. In addition to that, some of the most traumatic scenes were cutaways, freeze-frames or preceded a long jump into the future where we were never really sure exactly what just happened or who died (or not) until someone verbally mentioned it. It was as if the filmmakers were brave enough to release some hot topics, but pulled back in fear on others.I'm not sure how soon I'll be seeing this again &#x96; it's been nearly 30 years in between the first and second viewings, at any rate &#x96; because now I know how long it is, or feels. For, I don't have a problem with a 2 hour 16 minute movie; I just don't jump to the ones that feel twice that length.If you have not yet experienced Jenny's World, er, Garp's, then I thoroughly encourage you to absorb the wonderful performances, lines, humor, sadness, growth and hope.

His mother decides to write non-fiction novel about life, sex and lust. That becomes an national best-seller and she becomes an heroine for the feminist movement. While Garp is struggling with his writing career, while he's married to a smart woman Helen (Mary Beth Hurt) and having children of their own. Garp's life starts to fall apart when he starts to fool around once with the babysitter, his wife fools around as well and other disturbing moments has yet to come in his incredible life.Directed by the late Oscar-WinnerGeorge Roy Hill (Funny Farm, Slap Shot, The Sting) made an one of those rare films that was truly ahead of its time. The film has an major cult following as well. The performances are first-rate in this one of a kind film that plays with different genres extremely well. Close and John Lithgow as Roberta received Oscar Nominations for their brilliant supporting performances. I would have liked also if Roy Hill received an Oscar Nominated for Best Director, same goes for Williams for his sharp lead performance for Best Actor and Steve Tesich's (American Flyers, Breaking Away) excellent screenplay. Which he should gotten an Oscar Nomination for Best Adapated Screenplay. Since this picture is based on a novel by Oscar-WinnerJohn Irving (The Cider House Rider, The Hotel New Hampshire, Simon Birch). This movie is somewhat underrated today, this is probably one of the most remembered classics of the 1980's. Plenty of familiar faces appears in bit-parts or in cameos as well. This is a extraordinary film about an unusual man going through life, don't miss it. (**** ½/*****).

I rate it up there with Citizen Kane, Twelve Angry Men, and other such classics. The difference is The World According to Garp (Garp) isn't a typical drama.One cannot truly appreciate the symbolisms, metaphors, ironies, and foreshadowing without seeing the movie several times. Garp, like most movies based on books, takes artistic license from the novel. Garp, played by Robin Williams, is the bastard son of Jenny Fields (Glen Close), an extremely independent and idealist woman. One of the first ironies is that such a woman who rejects men in her life would have a son. Jenny, a nurse, is under the impression that men are guided mostly by their sexual desires and as such are untrustworthy and highly suspect. Jenny does want a child however, and decides the solution to having a child without the bother of a relationship with a man, is to have sex with a dying airman.Please note that the father being an airman plays a determining factor in the life of Garp. This is reflected many times throughout the movie in life and in symbolism. A beautiful thread is the beginning of the movie where Garp as a baby is being tossed repeatedly into the air (sky background), then several more times during the movie and finally at the end where Garp is being medevaced via helicopter to a hospital.Sex might be the most dominant theme, with such sub-themes as... ...the illegitimacy of Garp ...the infidelity of both Garp (implied) and his wife ...the rape and mutilation of a young girl (Helen James) ...the development of a self-mutilating cult of Helen Jamesions ...transexuality (John Lithgow) ...prostitutionDeath is the second most theme, with such sub-themes as......the death of Garp's father (a flier) ...the death of Garp (implied) (flying) ...the death of Garp's son (a result of two sub-themes, sex and flying)Garp decides to become a writer, Jenny Fields is an indomitable force throughout the life of Garp and becomes more so after writing her own book, Sexual Suspect. The book becomes a manefesto creating a cult of women in society who reject men in their lives. The cult also integrates the Helen Jamesions sub-cult.As with any movie, watch it before reading the book. As another reviewer said, this is a textbook example of how to make a movie based on a book. The only exception to this rule I ever found was Steven Spielberg's Carrie. While I am fond of Steven King's books, reading Carrie was a disappointment after seeing the movie.Additionally, I need to add that this is a very enjoyable movie to watch, light-hearted and full of hope at times, humorous at others. Watch it at face value the first time, enjoy it, then watch it over and over and appreciate it.

I haven't yet read the book, but will now to fill in the pieces like why Pooh hates Garp.The movie discusses, albeit appropriately cursorily, the difference between feminism and extreme cult behaviour using feminism as the excuse, and the irony is that Jenny had a boy, not a girl. Robin Williams was terrific as the suffering Garp, dealing with complex issues such as the surrounding the unique circumstances surrounding his birth which he seems to ignore while focusing on the idea of a dad. Garp was a man of unrealized dreams that he blamed both on his dad and his mom &#150; his dream of flying and his dream of popular writing. Both his parents apparently achieved their dreams, much to Garp's quiet chagrin.But Garp did achieve a marriage and to his college sweetheart no less. But even that was faulted, and almost ended up in destruction. What is particularly vexing in this relationship is how he could have forgiven her for the circumstances surrounding Walter's death, and even more perplexing, how she could have forgiven herself? And strictly in respect to the movie, was Helen supposed to be blandly and badly acted by an actress with absolutely no character, no personality, no charisma, and very ordinary in the attractiveness department? I watched, I looked at different angles, I concentrated &#150; but Helen was not a person that lit up the screen in any way, and there was no chemistry between her and anyone. I am hoping that was deliberate, and upon the reading the book I shall find out. If it wasn't deliberate casting, then this would be the one truly disappointing factor in the whole movie.Glenn Close and John Lithgow were tremendous. Glenn Close was strong and stood up straight and proud &#150; she reminded me of an Ayn Rand heroine except that she was a bit of a do-gooder in the end. That said, was she really? Why did she open up her house to these women? Was she simply lonely and had all this money and nothing to do with it? Did she feel guilty about stealing her son's literary limelight? She didn't write the book because she wanted to help women. But then, what was her motivation for writing the book? Why did she write it when she knew it would compete with her son? She is not well-explained in the movie, but ultimately her comment at the end that she didn't want to be the granny in the house seemed to underline her selfishness which is not unhealthy at all (she does not live vicariously through others or through the controlling of others &#150; she lives for herself and is true to herself). I do believe that Jenny was modeled after an Ayn Rand heroine. Three cheers!!! I am going to read more John Irving books to see if he has other Ayn Rand influences of if this was just a fluke. With that said, one comment I will make is that Ayn Rand never really deals with children and she had none of her own I believe, so her philosophy doesn't always extend well to parents and this may be John Irving's attempt (unintentional or not) at that which I do appreciate. By the way, a character of Ayn Rand's epic Atlas Shrugged is named Galt &#150; it may be interested to reread and note any similarities between Garp and Galt.Definitely a movie to see, especially single moms and sons which have very special issues associated with the missing role model dad.

I knew Robin Williams was a great actor, but this has to be the best dramatic role I've ever seen him in so far (keeping in mind that I haven't seen quite a few of his dramatic roles yet). He lays his emotions bare as T.S. Garp, the bastard son of Jenny Fields. The film is quite an emotional roller coaster, taking you from laughter, to shock and tears at various points throughout the long, but never dragging, narrative. It basically the entire life of Garp squeezed into about 130 minutes, consisting of snapshots and various episodes that he experiences as he gets older. His mother Jenny, played by Glenn Close (in her film debut) with motherly tenderness and wisdom, was also highly impressive. Even though it's Garp's story, his mother plays an integral part in shaping his worldview, which is unique to say the least. There's so many great moments in this film, that it's impossible to pick just one. Although, there is a couple scenes towards the end that were particularly poignant in the wake of Robin Williams' untimely death. I'm not afraid to admit that I cried a couple of times. There was even some of the relationship drama that struck a chord with me due to recent events in my own life that I'm still getting over. In short, I think this is one of the best films I've ever seen in my life, and is certain to be one of my favorites in years to come. On a side note, John Lithgow has a outstanding supporting turn as a trans-woman named Roberta. While Jared Leto might have done an excellent job in DALLAS BUYERS CLUB, Lithgow did it first and better in my opinion. There's also a small cameo by Amanda Plummer, in what was probably one of her first roles. So, it is with no hesitations that I can wholeheartedly recommend this film. It is honest, unpretentious and sentimental without being sappy (for the most part). A must-see for Robin Williams fans and cinephiles in general.

After success on T.V. and the fiasco that was Popeye, Williams finally became a major forced to be reckoned with on the big screen with this drama filled with subtle comedy about a free-spirited man influenced by his free spirited mom who purposely seduced a dying soldier simply so she could have his child.Don't you dare say sperm in this house!, her imperious papa (Hume Cronyn in an amusing cameo) tells daughter Glenn Close, a nurse with a love of life determined to be a mother without the benefit of marriage. Why she never even met the son of a bitch, Cronyn tells wife Jessica Tandy, upset to think that she basically raped the innocent man. Mom and dad may not have understood their daughter, but her son (Williams) understands her and loves her greatly, which is proved in a tragic scene where he understands without even knowing that something horrible has just taken place. Close focuses the first part of her life on raising him with great values yet independence, then she moves on to become heavily involved in the women's movement in protest over a young woman who was raped and had her tongue cut out to keep her quiet. Her assistant is a former football player (John Lithgow) who altered his sex to live as a woman. Free-spirited Williams instantly welcomes him/her as a close friend, a very touching gesture to see a straight man live by.Garp marries a smart woman (Mary Beth Hurt), has two children, and undergoes a series of marital issues all the while trying to fulfill his desire to fly, having learned that his late father was a pilot. Indeed, fliers are everywhere in this life, such as the metaphor of a pilot crashing into the new house Williams and Hurt have just purchased. There's a free spirited sexuality here too, with Close early on pairing her son with hooker Swoosie Kurtz just to study male sexuality and later Hurt's revenge on her philandering husband by having her own affair which leads to funny but disturbing moment where the poor young man she is involved with leads to an ironic twist of fate. The serious elements of this film outweigh the comic, however, and there are many important issues covered here in showing the desire to live one's dreams that sometimes lead to tragic consequences. When this film was first released, there were many complaints from the book readers over how the story was altered, but what ends up on screen is truly memorable. All of the performances are outstanding, with Close becoming a full fledged star as a result of this film and Lithgow moving into the realm of major star to be. Williams proved that he could be a dramatic actor of substance, and Hurt is very touching as well. With direction by the great George Roy Hill, the film has stood the test of time, and with Robin Williams' passing, is worth re-visiting to show that behind the mask of comedy is an even thicker mask of tragedy that sometimes is never revealed until it is too late.

I had heard his work is very quirky, surreal, American, and tackles subjects that make you squirm and in a way that makes you squirm even more. Garp exhibits all of these facets, and while I gasped at the awkwardness, basked in the Americana, squirmed at the subject matter and raised an eyebrow many times in between, I ultimately found it interesting, but I can't quite say that I liked it. Even so, I believe this is a fault of the movie and not the material.Lust. (Do I have your attention)? Anyway, of Garp's various subjects, this is the at the forefront, which becomes clear very quickly as the word is a sort of anti-mantra for Jenny Fields (Glenn Close), a nurse at an all-boys school and mother of the titular character. Having conceived Garp in a situation completely free of lust, having taken advantage of a dying WWII pilot who, shall we say, couldn't stop standing at attention, Fields is a woman constantly on the lookout for any kind of carnal expression. This is hardly a boon for her son, who is introduced as an imaginative, wistful boy whose dreams and fantasies are filled with airplanes and what his father might have been like, and who directs those yearnings towards becoming a successful author and, much to his mother's dismay, pleasing women, as he grows into Robin Williams. Garp is able to evade his mother's determination while courting his college sweetheart, but she still ends up making his life very difficult when, as soon as Garp's first book hits stores, she too assembles her own literary breakthrough a sprawling and much more successful anti-lust manifesto. The work transforms Jenny into a sort of feminist cult figure, particularly to a group of supporters calling themselves Ellen Jamesians, each of whom cut their tongue out in support of a rape victim of the same name. As Jenny's influence expands, Garp does his best to provide a good life for his wife and kids, and while his efforts cause Jenny to gradually shed her misgivings, they of course draw the ire of the Jamesians. Naturally, this clash of ideals escalates to a shocking and circular conclusion.If anything, Garp's exploration of lust is successful at demonstrating the extent to which we control our lustful urges or let them control us directs our growth as people. What this exploration does, though, is reveal truths that are even more interesting, namely that staying too true to an ideal, no matter how honorable, can have debilitating effects, and that the rejection of any alternatives to that ideal often stems from fear and ignorance. This is perhaps best revealed in a scene where Garp's mother confronts a prostitute not to accost her, but to simply understand why she does what she does and if she gets any joy out of it. Poignant moments like these are the movie's strength, as are its performances, particularly Close as Jenny and John Lithgow as Roberta, a transsexual former football player and Jenny follower. Robin Williams' performance, on the other hand, is unsuitably passive, especially for a man under so many constricting influences. And as interesting as Garp's themes may be, it does not excuse the movie from telling its story unsatisfactorily. Many scenes that come across as quirky or surreal may have just been poorly translated to the screen. If I had not have known Garp was an adaptation, I would have figured it out, as I often felt the need to reach for some kind of guide for more information. Also, there is what feels like a push to make the movie into an inspirational family drama as it goes on, which does not really go along with its sensibility-challenging ways. A lot of the interesting parts I mentioned (the Ellen Jamesians, Roberta's dilemma) fall more and more by the wayside or simply become less interesting. But really, the movie never quite achieves the right balance between the surreal and the grounded, or even the comedic and the serious. A climatic scene involving one of Garp's sons and its aftermath, for example, left me wondering whether to laugh or cry, and even if anything really happened at all. In short, Garp left me with a lot to think about, but with a lot of it being whether or not the filmmakers knew what they had to work with or even if they fully understood it.

Glenn Close as his eccentric mother, Jenny Fields, was a woman before her time, and played her role so well. John Lithgoe should of gotten an Oscar as a former pro-football quarterback, now Roberta. Mary Beth Hurt did very well as Garp's wife. Many smaller parts done by actors who went on to even bigger roles. If you like the movie, consider reading some of John Irving's books.

Irving that many said would be impossible to film, but director George Roy Hill has crafted a vastly entertaining, yet disturbing film full of stark visual images and unusual plot twists. The film centers on the life of T.S.Garp (T.S. stands for Technical Sargent), a young man raised in the 50's and 60's by his mother Jenny Fields, who chose to have Garp out of wedlock because she wanted a child, not a husband. Garp is seen in college as a wrestler but really wants to become a writer and eventually does. Watching Garp write inspires his mother to write also, which Garp initially laughs off as he continues to write book after book. However, Jenny writes one book called Sexual Suspect which becomes a feminist manifesto and makes Jenny an international celebrity overnight, much to the chagrin of her son, who even though he writes several books, never achieves the stardom his mother does. but instead of basking in the fame, Jenny becomes an underdog for the handicapped, misunderstood, and mistreated including a transsexual named Roberta Muldoon who used to be a tight end for the Phildaelphia Eagles and the film shows how Garp tries to carve out his own career while being in deep denial about his jealousy regarding his mother's success. Robin Williams turns in one of the best performances of his career as Garp and Glenn Close, in a stunning film debut, is a revelation as Jenny Fields. Mary Beth Hurt plays Garp's wife Helen and John Lithgow is a standout as Roberta Muldoon. Despite the fact that I never read the book, I enjoyed this thoughtful and intelligent film immensely that asks tough questions and doesn't always provide easy answers. For a truly unique motion picture experience, try THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP.

I haven't read the book but the film paints the portrait of a man born illegitimately to a weird mother and his ensuing life. The only problem is that the canvas is 40 foot square and no two bits of paint touch each other. It seems to be a series of events, most of which have little effect on Garp's character, causing him to stagnate until the car crash, and the only link between one event and the next is if it adds something to the scenery such as a house or a child. For example **SPOILERS**SPOILERS** after Garp has sex with the baby-sitter on his way to take her home, he arrives back at home, answers his wife about seducing the babysitter and then nothing. Yes, the next babysitter they have is male but they're living at an all boys school, who else are they going to get?**END OF SPOILERS**I plan on watching it a third time to see if there's something I missed but from where I sit things don't seem to make any sense.

The acting prowess of Williams, Lithglow and Close are evident and Hill is dexterous as a director, but the bottom line is that Irving provided a great story to work with.  (BTW- one aspect of the written version I did not care for is a incongrous spouse-swapping part between Garp, Helen and another couple that was wisely left out of the film).Also I did not like the scene where Walt dies (this happens in the book too) considering the salacious circumstance surronding it, but this fault alone does not bog down the picture.

George Roy Hill delivers a consistently faithful cinematic realisation of John Irving's wonderful The World According to Garp.The film is the life-spanning story of T.S. Garp, the unusually obtained son of stern, stubborn, and self-sufficient wartime nurse Jenny Fields. Raising Garp without a father, she watches him grow up, becoming a famed novelist and family man as she herself gains renown as a powerful feminist voice.The World According to Garp is notable as Robin William's first lead role, one he takes and soars with. He is the perfect Garp, bringing to life the beloved character from the pages. In fact, this is true of all the characters and actors, the replication of Irving's story on film well achieved by the faithful Hill. The film is incredibly loyal to the source, and therein is its downfall. Memorable scenes from the novel are featured rather unnecessarily to the movie narrative at times, and ultimately it fails to translate particularly effectively to film, resulting in an overall mediocrity and general lacking. The life spanning plot does not quite work in the film, a consistent storyline only really forming in the last half hour; a half hour which ends up feeling rushed and forced. This medium is simply unsuited to the epic length covered by the far more allowing original text, many scenes finding inclusion when they're really just not needed. For those unfamiliar with the book, the film may well seem messy and inconsistent.Though commendable for its devotion to its literary origins, The World According to Garp fails to construct a fully engaging and engrossing story for its cinematic audience. Nice to see for fans of the book despite this, it boasts a great cast and strong performances which rescue it from ill fate.

What I remember most about hating the film is that it was almost the complete opposite of what I had understood when I read the book. Since I haven't re-read it, I can only give you my impressions from the past - but I am sure of one thing - the film is a paean to family life, whereas in the book, almost ALL traditional institutions - including, and perhaps especially, marriage - are shown to be strait-jackets that we would be well rid of. The only positive in the book is the wondrous nature of children...something that only the very beginning and ending of the film really captures (with that incredibly gorgeous baby floating in the air. Too bad Williams doesn't have a tenth of his charm!) My low mark is therefore from the fact that the film misrepresents the book. As a film on its own it fares better - but only for a few key performances. Mary Beth Hurt is wonderful - I think anyone watching it would fall in love with her. And John Lithgow as an ex football player who has had a sex-change operation is fantastic... he never once camped it up or made the character anything but commendable - and as such his performance had an incredibly integrity. I watched him closely during all of his scenes, and never once was he anything except womanly. Nothing in his performance ever came near the performance of a drag queen... and that made all the difference. In fact, of all the people in the film, his is the only one which is irreproachable.
