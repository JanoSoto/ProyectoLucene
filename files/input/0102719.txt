You've just got to see this movie to understand everything that is wrong with it. It came out during the time period where everybody was trying to make family movies that everyone could enjoy (The little rascals; Mr. Nanny, etc.) yet it lacked any charisma or enthusiasm. Every single character in the movie is driven by rage, with the exception of Trixie's mother, who shows only aggravation and weariness, possibly at the tired cliché's this movie enjoys. To put it simply, the biggest flaw in the film was not the acting, nor the filming, but most notably the writing. The lines we receive are reminiscent of Disney classics, although this film lacks the whole-heartedness IL' Walt managed to pull off. Junior's Dad, (John Ritter) makes you mad without even doing anything, simply because he allows Junior to run around unsupervised, and only gives him a stern warning when he tapes a 200-pound behemoth to a chalk board. Also, Junior's grandfather is particularly excruciating. For those of you who saw the first one, found it nauseating, and thus, did not see the second one, Big Ben Healy as he is referred to in this movie, is still a total douche. He basically barges into John Ritter's house uninvited, settles himself in Junior's room, even though he says that he hates Junior, and basically does nothing to accelerate the film's speed, or to support the film in any way. Rather, he ticks off the audience by being a lazy free loader.Finally, we are introduced to a wide variety of new characters, such as the smug, obnoxious, Trixie, who carries dynamite in her backpack, which she first lights, then hands, to Junior, who simply stares wide eyed at. Also, Gilbert Gottfried returns in this film, this time playing the obnoxious principal at Junior's new elementary school. If Gilbert Gottfried ain't enough to get the point across, I will put it simply This film reeks!2/10 stars, because the actor's convictions shine through the film, even though the script sucks.

Some like to pick on Gigli or Battlefield Earth. Some pick on classics like Plan 9 From Outer Space. Ever since I was 14 I have been very vocal in saying that to me, it is Problem Child 2, and 9 years later, I feel the exact same way. It's not one of the worst, it's not just an expression. It is THE ACTUAL worst movie I have ever seen.How much farting, pooping, peeing, and puking can you put in a single movie? I don't need to see a dog take a dump that goes up to my waist! Why is it that I'm so hard on this filth? I have nothing against bathroom or gross-out humor. Heck, I like the American Pie movies. Having such an excess of it within 90 minutes is a bad idea, but the true tipping point is to do it with kids! Having little kids call each other sexual names (IMDb won't even let me post that word on here, yet here it is coming out of the mouths of 8 year olds. Think of the irony in that!) and urinate and puke on each other just makes the whole thing feel dirtier. Worst line in the movie I guess I should fart in more people's offices. What other film has urination into lemonade, dynamite sticks exploding toilets, a little boy filming his babysitter having sex and projecting it on the side of the house, and a little girl joking about scratching testicles? However, my absolute favorite moment has to be when the same little girl is on a carnival ride, says I'm gonna puke, opens her mouth, and fake looking puke shoots straight out of her open mouth in a perfect 90 degree angle! The puking scene in Scary Movie 2 looked more real than that. I suppose the only redeeming element in the movie is Gilbert Gottfried. You get the impression that he didn't even have a script, but was just being his usual self. Too bad he has to act stupid while pizza gets thrown on him.You know what?

Watching Junior team up with the adorable little Trixie, portrayed flawlessly by Ivyann Schwan (I am extremely excited to see her latest work...her only work since 1994 (sad to say), Solitaire, which is due for release in 2007), serves as a clear cut example of the ability for humankind to put aside its differences and work together to solve the problems which face us all in today's modern society.

Aside from that, the flicks are as demonic as their hero. In this basically unnecessary sequel, freshly separated Ben (Ritter) and his little hellraiser Junior (Michael Oliver, who never needs screen-time ever again) move to a new town infested with willing bachelorettes. Ben eventually picks Lawanda (played by the most underused original SNL-er Laraine Newman), whose Blanche DuBois tendencies don't suit Junior in the least. To add on to Junior's torture, it seems this town already has a little firestarter in younger girl form with Trixie, who coincidentally has a sweet, single mother played by Yasbeck, the same actress who played Junior's first horrible mother-through-adoption. You can see where the plot goes from here. Searching for my favorite scene is like pulling teeth, so I guess I'll go with the cherry bomb in the toilet gag that makes Back to the Future's James Tolkan one of the many grown-up victims (that guy's always playing school authority figures). Jack Warden and Gilbert Gottfried return as their parts from the first film, but sadly, there is no appearance from the Bow-tie Klansma- er, I mean Killer (Michael Richards) that made Problem Child all the more fun. On a serious note, I'm sure these films, whether abusive parents saw them or no, did wonders for the red-headed children of America.

Young women leave their husbands/boyfriends and line up in front of Ben's doorstep, all falling victim to Junior's menacing ways. As Junior tries to adjust to his new school, he meets his match in the form of Trixie (Ivyann Shawann), a bratty little girl, who shares Junior's knacks for trouble-making. Ben falls in love with the school nurse (Amy Yasbeck), who turns out to be Trixie's mother.I wasn't a big fan of Problem Child (1990), nor am I interested in its sequel, Problem Child 2 (1991). There is no excuse for the kids in these movies to wreak havoc on adults. There used to be a time when kids weren't supposed to attack adults in movies. Now, apparently, everybody laughs when a kid plays with a grill and blows another guy away. And some of the kid's attempts to getting back at adults isn't funny- -it's crude, sometimes disgusting, and even life-threatening.And, yes, we do see Junior's trouble-making ways-- he seems to know a lot about setting the barbecue to explode. He also scares off the women willing to go out with Ben, tapes the teenage school bully to a chalkboard, and he even videotapes--and broadcasts--his babysitter and her boyfriend having sex. Even a scene where a man drinks a cup of urine is deemed funny. And what is so funny about Junior playing with the controls of a roller coaster ride while the passengers and even their parents from below end up vomiting all over the place? All of this belongs in another movie, NOT a kids' movie.But kids will probably find this stuff funny. They will no doubt see this movie which is being marketed as a family comedy(in spite of the MPAA's PG-13 rating), and root for Junior Healy. But I didn't. I did not see him as an innocent child, but as a destructive, vengeful monster. Adults will groan in despair. Larraine Newman has an over-the-top role as LaWanda Dumore, who wants to marry Ben and knows of Junior's evil ways. She wants to get rid of Junior by sending him to boarding school. She is a bitch on heels. Her sole purpose in this movie is to create a villain in the tradition of Cruela De Vil.The only person who manages to steal the show is Jack Warden who also returns as Ben's father.The Problem Child series is an embarrassment to the late John Ritter and Michael Oliver. One may even ask why Oliver's parents would allow their child to play to such a nasty and vile character. And Ivyann Shawann is so annoying as Trixie, you have the feeling that she was only cast to give Junior a cohort in his trouble-making ways. I also didn't buy the preachy subplot about a big, large rock that might be able to make dreams come true.This movie may have been funny when you were a kid, but as an adult or parent, you'll probably be sometimes shocked at what is being depicted on the screen.It's obnoxiousness two times around.

This movie, is even more horrible if you can believe it. Problem Child 2 is more painful, more destructive, and more terrible than ever before. As with the first movie, all of the copies of this movie that exist in this world should be taken out and burned on a massive bonfire. Once again, the acting in the movie is terrible, John Ritter and Jack Warden are wasted in their roles, Gilbert Gottfried is also wasted, as he wasn't funny at all here, but ultimately, who is the worst in the movie? You guessed it, Michael Oliver, who reprises his role as the demonic hell child who causes trouble everywhere he goes, and even worse? This time around, he's got a young girl as a partner in crime. Just the thought of that is bound to cause people to expect horrible things to come from them, which happens, and boy, how they happen is something incredible (and I don't mean that in a good way).What is funny about this movie? Nothing, not one single thing is funny. Junior is even worse here. There's a scene where he serves somebody his urine in the form of lemonade. Yes, I did just say that. There's also a scene where he's at an amusement park, and he reprograms a ride, causing everyone to throw up in a disgusting sequence, and why did he do this? It was out of revenge for him being too small to go on the ride. What's more, is he blows up a barbecue grill, he videotapes two people having sex, and he does much more. His partner in crime, Trixie, is no better, she is very bratty, obnoxious, and belligerent, and even worse, she helps Junior out in his schemes. What on Earth could the people in this movie have done to deserve to endure the torture of these two demons? Or better, what on Earth could we have done to deserve to endure the torture of this movie and the previous movie?All in all, like the first Problem Child movie, Problem Child 2 is one of the worst movies ever made, there is not one single funny scene in this movie to be found, not one at all, not a single one, not one. If you want a good comedy, watch a good movie with Abbott And Costello, The Marx Brothers, or Laurel And Hardy, anything but this absolute atrocity of a movie. How the people behind this thought that this was a good idea for a movie I will probably never know, and I probably don't want to know either. The only reason I sat through this entire movie was because I wanted to see Junior and Trixie get a well deserved punishment for their actions, which absolutely DID NOT happen. Probably because we are supposed to feel sorry for Junior, because he's a problem child. But once again, when you see how horrible Junior is, you will wish that you could warp yourself inside the TV and give that horrid brat a hard kick in the mouth.BOMB/10 "},{"Title":"Dennis the Menace's sociopath younger brother","Date":"29 January 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Family","Review":" Quite a stupid film condoning sociopath behavior.

This movie is one of those rare comedies that can be called epics because it has the ability to take the mundane aspects of a boring reality and make them exciting.I found myself rooting for JR all throughout the movie. The story of Junior belongs among the annals of the greatest folk heroes of any civilization that has, does, or ever will exist. His desire to transcend himself through his crazy antics and to make himself get noticed.This movie is deep, and the first thought that came to my mind is that JR is the superman. He represents the new breed of humanity that takes actions into his own hands to achieve his results. He does not wait passively by and wait for things to just happen, he makes things happen. JR is what we all should aspire to. His actions in both movies reinforce the fact. If we all wore pink bow ties, and, and angered our adopted grand fathers, then we would all learn how to regain our humanity.Trixie and Junior make an awesome team together.

I don't think it did. The original movie's only redeeming asset was Gilbert Gottfried, and he wasn't even good in this sequel.I can't really put my finger on why this movie was bad. For starters, it just wasn't funny. Even when I saw this as a nine-year-old, I didn't sympathize with Junior (Michael Oliver) at all. His character came off to me as whiny, self-loathing, and perhaps most importantly, a rebel without a clue. He appeared to hate every woman that his father Ben (John Ritter) dated for the sole sake of hating them. It also doesn't send a good message to kids with divorced parents (who constitute over half children in the U.S. these days) when the one woman Ben decides to (almost) marry is a Southern aristocrat who is vindictive and who happens to hate children as it is.And as cool as I thought it would have been to see original SNL cast mate Laraine Newman come back to the big screen, she couldn't even save this movie. I also found it strange that she was a white Southern débutante whose name was Lawanda. That sounds more like an African-American woman's name. But of course, that has nothing to do with why I disliked this movie.I think the movie didn't work because you had antagonists you were supposed to hate, along with protagonists you weren't supposed to hate. John Ritter's character was supposed to be a good parent who tried desperately to teach his child right from wrong without conforming to authoritative parenting. Instead, he came off not only as a wimpy parent, but also one who was desperate to find a wife in a matter of days, regardless of how well he knew the woman. Did I mention this sends a bad message to children of divorced parents?In a nutshell, the rest of the things that went wrong with this movie included Amy Yasbeck unnecessary and unexplained return to play an entirely different character, that young girl who was even more obnoxious than Junior, completely uncalled for toilet humor, and even more outrageous and outdated homophobic humor (involving the dog catchers). The movie was just a mess, and really doesn't deserve a DVD release if it hasn't been given one already. It should just rot on VHS along with all the other bad, forgettable 90's comedies.

Some people think that John Ritter wasn't good in this movie, but i thought he was pretty much just as good in it as he is in any other one of his movies. The only reason why i didn't give this movie a strait up 10 stars because the principal ruins it ( Mr. Peabody), he is really annoying.

This sequel is bad admittedly, but it isn't the very worst sequel out there(Home Alone 4 gets that dishonour) and it certainly isn't as bad as Problem Child 3Junior in Love, which is Bottom 100 material. Starting with the good things, some parts are funny, like the food fight and the vomiting on the roller coaster and Gilbert Gottfried is often hilarious here as is Jack Warden. However, where the film comes down is an awful script, leaden direction, rushed camera work an even more obnoxious performance than ever before from Michael Oliver as the dysfunctional kid and apart from one or two exceptions the jokes do not work. In terms of performances, John Ritter is lost at sea here not surprised seeing as how little he was given to do, and Amy Yasbeck's performance is pretty much a copyright of her performance in the first film.

Even if you are the child who cannot fit or the child with a poor family situation. (spoilder for both movies) Not to get into the first movie, but it is hard to write about one and not the other, since they are both connected, but I like how in both movies the father seemed to stay on his side for the most part. However, this movie is not a great influence for children in some ways. For example, the father seems to encourage bad behavior instead of, for example telling junior to be nice to little girls. In the first one, I do not like how the father received the ransom note and was practically throwing a party, even if in the end he saved junior. I know his wife was mean, but that does not make it right for him to blow her off and leave her in a dangerous situation like that. And his fiancé was mean in the second one, but it did not make it right for the children to almost hurt her or to put themselves in danger. I could understand if it was doing some little funny things, like in Matilda, but this movie went a little too far. Also, I thought it was a little insulting to women to have all those women lining up for the husband at the door to meet the father like women are all just so desperate that they will go to any man they see. For all they knew he could have been a looser.

I thought it was funny in places and a lot less irritating than the first film too. Amy Yasbeck returns as a totally different character who is very likable compared to the one she played in the first film. I also think the plot is better here as they did not need to add a crazy Michael Richards character to the end of this one to pad the film out like they did in the first film either. Everything is going about as well as can be expected for Junior and his dad as they have moved into a new neighborhood and Junior is trying very hard to not be the problem child he was in the first film. Unfortunately, gramps is soon moving in with them and there is a very nasty lady who for some reason just has to marry Junior's dad. Add to that another little hellion lives in this town though I loved the scene where Junior gets her on that amusement park ride. The comedy is better, but in the end this movie is one of those I classify as not good, but not bad either. I am surprised to see how low score is here, so I realize I am in the minority in thinking this one surpasses the original film.

If Airplane! and Top Secret are 10s and an episode of an average sitcom is a 4 then this is a definite 8.

In his first adventure since his last! He and his new dad, Ben, are leaving Cold River behind them and are about to start a new life in Mortville! It's a long drive, but they finally make it to the house of their dreams! It's wonderful!          The single women of the neighborhood are turned on when they see Ben. Neighbor, Aaron Burger, invites the Healys to a barbecue, which blows up in his face. Literally; Junior starts his first day of school-- only to find that Mr. Peabody, the man who ran the adoption agency back in Cold River, was now a school principal. He put's Junior in the sixth grade to get rid of him quicker. Junior meets a new friend 15 year old Murph, who's been in the sixth grade since God-only-knows. Junior also meets Trixie, a little trouble maker.          That night, Ben goes out on a date and leaves Junior with a bogus babysitter. When Ben returns home, Big Ben drops in! Bringing his nasty dog, Nippy. Ben let's them stay; meanwhile, bank president LaWanda Dumore (played by Saturday Night Live beauty Laraine Newman), takes a liking to Ben and wants to marry him, but Ben has taken a liking to the gorgeous school nurse, Annie Young. One night, Ben and Junior go to the carnival. Junior wants to ride a wild ride called The Crazy Dance, but he's too short. It's a scene right out of the Tom Hanks film Big (which I wrote a review for also, if you'd like to read it. Later though, you're not done with this one). Junior's friends Murph and Trixie got to go on, but Junior sabotages the ride, making it really blow. Blow chunks that is! When they return home, they meet LaWanda, who's changed their blue trimmed home into a red trimmed one. LaWanda detests Junior, who tries to tell Ben, who doesn't believe him. Even worse LaWanda turned Junior's cool space themed bedroom into a clown themed one! Ugh! But despite his efforts to extricate LaWanda from the premises, she still stays.           LaWanda is rushed to the hospital because they found rabies in her blood test. Gee, I wonder who did that. Ben and Junior go to Pizzarific for dinner and see Annie and Trixie there. A food fight, started by Mr. Peabody ensues, but Ben, Junior and the Youngs were blamed. Soon, the wedding day of Ben and LaWanda comes. Junior tries to stop it, and succeeds when Ben sees what an awful person LaWanda was and decided to go with Annie, so it's a happy ending.          This movie was as good as the first! It was annoying the way people kept coming into Ben and Junior's life when they were just beginning to enjoy life as a twosome. Three's a crowd!! An interesting fact Amy Yasbeck, who played Ben's annoying wife Flo, in Problem Child 1, plays plesant, kind new wife Annie in this movie.I recommend this movie! If you haven't seen it already, see it. This sequel is rated PG-13, because Junior's pranks have been taken to a more extreme level. I guess. The first one was PG, so this one being PG-13, is more extreme. Anyway, I gotta go. See this movie when you can.

I loved the first movie,but there was a lot that could have been done to make it so much funnier. This movie seems to have found the way, but takes it in the wrong direction. One problem is the introduction of Ivyann Schwan as Juinor's female superior. She's an adorable little actress, but the movie doesn't have enough room for two little monsters. Another thing wrong is the Laraine Newman sub-plot it doesn't belong nor is it any funny. Three is the surreal situations inserted into the script; the dog food commercial in the back of the van and the stuffed dog for the one who gets permanently hypnotized. Another is the return of Jack Warden. He's a bit more antagonizing and a lot more unbearable than in the first film. There are some good points. Juinor has gone to inflicting his sadistic brand of mischief on only who deserves it and Amy Yasbeck finally gets a role where she can shine. John Ritter does well too in his role as we see more depth to his character and Gilbert Gottfried returns to finally be the nemesis of Juinor's humor and mischief. There's a brief look into the minds of children as Juinor and Trixie connive to pair their parents up. Eric Edwards of Senior Trip illogically plays a teenager left back too many times (shouldn't he be in reform school) and Charlene Tilton has a cameo as an over-sexed and over-developed divorcee in an all too brief scene.

Well you will, if you rent this.  My therapist suggested I do this to help myself recover from the agony known as Problem Child 2, as a form of therapy.  No, but seriously, it's that bad, heck, I saw it ten years ago, and it still haunts me.  Be careful, the government is considering using this for psychological warfare.

Does anyone utter the line 'I'd rather eat a turd' in that movie?This movie is WAY too infantile and moronic for adults, and WAY too violent and irresponsible for children. Is there that much money in the Beavis and Butt-head demographic to make a series of movies like this? There is a Problem Child 3, but I haven't seen it. I'd rather eat a turd.

The first film went over the top with its scenes of a devilish child wrecking major havoc in the lives of everyone he's around. Here, it goes even further over the top. And one scene in this movie proves that theory. That carnival ride sequence was too much for me to stomach. It's awful.

Also the Crazy Dance ride operator is not fair to Junior for not letting him go on the ride. And that Lawanda Dumore is as horrible as a serial killer to Junior because she made threatening insults to Junior which is why I cannot tolerate this movie. Even if the movie is re-released back into theatres in the extended version, I still would not see this movie because this movie is not something I can even tolerate. In fact, it stinks!

I love John Ritter and Jack Warden as father and son. You can't forget Junior. Amy Yasbeck who first played his wife in the first film now plays a lovely school nurse who has a problem child of her own. I love Gilbert Gottfried as the annoying principal. This film was never meant to do anything but be fun and it does it just fine. I like seeing MArtha Quinn and Charlene Tilton act as possible second wives to Little Ben Healy. Of course, Loraine Newman is great as the multiple divorced bride who wants little Ben Healy and can't stand children. Her scenes with Junior are fun to watch. Of course, they double the problem child with Ivyann Swann who plays Trixie. She does a devilish time making trouble for Junior as he comes to a new town and school. I love the Problem Child movies and wished that they moved to television rather than stay in film. I never saw the third sequel because they don't have John Ritter or Junior, that lovely red head boy. It's for kids, parents, and anybody who wants to laugh.

Junior and his father move to a beautiful town called Mortville. Ben is trying to fit in the social pipeline as he tries to go to his neighbor's BBQ and go on dates. Junior has other plans. He hates all the crazy women his father dates and Big Ben Healy(Warden) pays them both a visit as we learn he's got no other place to go. Ben then meets the nurse from Junior's school, Annie(Yasbeck). He begins to like her and asks her out but she states she cannot go out because of a problem. Ben then meets rich gal, LaWanda Dumore,(Newman) who begins to fancy Ben and will do whatever it takes to win his heart even if it means dealing with trouble maker Junior. She hates kids and doesn't even flinch when Junior pulls a few pranks on her. Realizing he's going to lose no matter what, Junior and new pal Trixie(who were actually enemies in the beginning of the movie) team up and decide to get their single parents together. Trixie is worst than Junior and we finally realize what Nurse Annie's problem is She's Trixie's mother. In the middle of the wedding between LaWanda and Ben, Trixie ruins it and Ben realizes he's been in love with Annie the whole time and not LaWanda. Annie and Ben kiss and Big Ben kisses LaWanda. Junior and Trixie are happy and the movie ends with the four of them walking off to the house. Cute, gross but hilarious!!!

For just one of those 'child actors' films anyway. Michael Oliver put on a great performance, just as he did in the first film except in this one Ivyann kicks it up a notch. Her character, Trixie, is conniving and pulls some great pranks on Junior. I was definitely inspired by this movie to pull some killer pranks on my whole family. If you have ever saw the first one I think you will favor this sequel more. Another good point in the movie is you didn't have to see the first one to think this one is great. The writers put a good combination of family, fun, and making the best of that horrible place they call school. This movie is definitely not as bad as the critics say it is. Check it out, its at least good enough for lots of laughs.

Comedy nowadays is mostly associated with everything that is crude. It's very few times where we see comedies that that are natural to their tastes. So what is comedy? But surely, this movie is not! This is purely a waste of time, empty with plot, script and anything needed, not to just make a comedy, but an entire movie. This film is advertised as a comedy. But how funny is a ton of feces used or people vomiting? I'm pretty sure it's enough to walk out while this movie is screening.
