An excellent movie on the whole, complete with cameos by the original Brady Bunch cast and '70s icons.The beauty of this movie, has I've mentioned before, is that it is done so authentically. There are little touches here and there (you may need to watch the movie a few times to notice), such as 'The Partridge Family' bus going by just before the singing competition scene.There are some hilarious moments (some quite cringe worthy too!). Mike Brady giving a 'wise' speech, Marcia getting hit in the nose by a football, Marcia's dance and so many more. I even find when Jan knocks some boxes off funny! Pacing wise, it moves very fast so you don't get bored. It runs smoothly. No qualms there.It is really amusing to see a naive, sweet '70s family fit in with '90s California grunge. It's a great movie - many great memories of this.

However their next door neighbour is trying to get all the land around the area acquired to build a mall.  He has been hiding their mail and causing them to build up $20K in unpaid taxes.  The kids set about trying to raise the money to save the family home.Reading the reviews shows me that people just don't get this film.  I think this is a great example of what should happen when you remake a cheesy TV show from all our childhood's.  The whole film is one big self-mocking joke about the values of the Brady's.  The plot is not really important but it is a good summing up of the daft plots they had back then, however here it is just a device for the jokes.The joke here is that we have a slightly modern spin on the family.  We see them being all cheesy and full of morals even when surrounded by the dog eat dog world of LA in the nineties, but they are still the same.  I find this funny and the moral lessons etc are all delivered tongue in cheek.  The best bit of self mocking is the modern expansion of the characters &#150; this thing is full of innuendoes and nice touches &#150; like Jan hearing voices etcThe cast are all spot on. Long and Cole talk it straight but let their looks and glances tell a different story (Long is excellent), while the kids are all very very good.  I'd never seen the show till after this so I didn't see any cameos or anything but really this isn't important.This is great &#150; you don't need to have seen the show.  It's wonderfully self mocking and very very funny.  Those who criticise it for not being serious or for being a joke just are getting it at all.  Great fun!

The casting in itself was a stroke of genius. I'm still not sure if they actually froze Maureen McCormick (the REAL Marcia Brady), only to unthaw her in time to return to her role in this film; the actress playing Marcia in this film looks like a clone of the original! Shelley Long is also striking as Carol, as are Cindy, Bobby and Alice. -- Several original cast members from the TV series had cameos, most noteworthy Ann B. Davis (Alice), who returned as a truck driving confidante to a confused run-away Jan. -- Florence Henderson showed up as her own meddling mother who finally (much overdue) told Jan to cut the crap!, giving her a swift smack on the cheek, thus curing her of her chronic and tiresome wining. -- We meet the Brady's neighbors the Dittmeyers, who were frequently mentioned, but never actually shown on the TV program. Here they are no Fred & Ethel, but scheming, manipulative opportunists, eager to convince the Bradys to sell their house (to them), in order for a big developer to turn the entire neighborhood into a huge building project. -- The film is also loaded with cheesy advice we remember Mike & Carol dishing out in over-dose rations during their 5 year run in prime time (not to mention the zillions of re-runs to follow). This will always be Sherwood Schwartz's biggest hit. The Brady Bunch will go down with Lucy, Andy and Samantha as America's best loved all-time favorite sit coms. The Brady Bunch Movie only intensified America's love affair with the light fluff that dreams are made of. This film is a winner in my book!

This movie covered certain things, which could not have been done on 70's TV- like Peter's growing up dilemmas. Everyone gave brilliant performances- there is homage to certain episodes- most of which were very popular- especially the one with Marcia's swollen nose. A bit of trivia- in the TV series- Mr. Dittmeyer is the Brady's neighbors- though I doubt he has ever appeared in any episode, his name has been mentioned on many episodes.Anyone who was a fan of the TV series should check this movie out.

After all, despite the original show having a bit of a following, the show was completely saccharine and impossible for anyone other than kids to like. So why, oh why, would I want to see this?! Well, it turns out I was wrong--wrong because the film WAS good to watch and wrong because this was NOT the same Brady Bunch I remember from my youth.So what was so right about this film? Well, first it was not a remake of the show, but a parody of it--the only way this could have worked. In this case, it's the same sort of Brady family BUT they are living exactly as they did in 1970--despite it being 1995. In other words, the clothes, the language, the actors and their spot-on impersonations of the originals (I particularly loved Gary Cole and the way he talked just like Mike Brady) and the music are all circa 1970--and everyone around the Brady family just stares at them in total disbelief. TO make things even better, there is a wonderful visit from Davy Jones as well as a wonderful plot involving Jan and hear jealousy of Marsha, Marsha, Marsha! As for the plot, this might be the biggest weakness. While it isn't bad, the film's theme of the evil neighbors and the Brady family losing their home never is as fun or interesting as the sequel--A VERY BRADY SEQUEL--and you MUST see this sequel.

However, I liked the decision for Paramount to have some cameos from the likes of Florence Henderson and the late Ann B. Davis. The film is a bit campy at time, but it takes some getting used to. The jokes are really good, but the main joke is seeing how the Bradys react in the 1990's, and fortunately that joke did not disappoint.Betty Thomas's film has all the original characters from the television series, including my favorite Alice the housekeeper. A scheming neighbor of the Bradys plan to take their house unless they can raise twenty thousand dollars. They discover that participating in a musical may be their only bet to keep their property.The film was not badly acted. The new actors retained enough of the characters wit to be effective. Shelley Long and Gary Cole as the parents were very good. Christine Taylor as the eldest daughter, Marcia is also very good and beautiful! Michael McKean is effective as the scheming neighbor. Finally, Henriette Mantel as Alice actually reminded me of Ann B. Davis's Alice very much so.Overall, The Brady Bunch Movie is an effective comedy and a successful reboot showing a new generation the wonders of the Brady family. The movie often movies into slapstick territory and relies on physical comedy perhaps a bit too much, but that doesn't hurt the film too much. Nothing beats the original Brady family, but this Brady family was very good and quite funny. This is the story of how 1970 met 1995 to pretty funny results. I rate this film 9/10.

I gather I am not on the same wavelength as its many fans. I'm still not clear on what they're fans OF. So I went in to see 'The Brady Bunch Movie' thinking, this will be a couple of hours of my life I'll never get back. And then I proceeded to laugh my fool ass off. The spoofery here is perfect and dead on target; it seems almost too easy of a kill. The makers of the film must have felt like kids in a candy store. What do you lampoon mercilessly first? Marcia's airheadedly blonde conceit? Jan's borderline-psycho jealousy of Marcia? Mike Brady's emptyheaded homilies? Carol Brady's hairdo? Don't get impatient, the film gets to all of them in due course, and many others. 'The Brady Bunch Movie' basically takes the Brady family on its own terms but thrusts them into the 1990's where they are even more out of place than before. The principal running joke is that they don't consider themselves odd at all, in fact the Bradys feel they are the hippest, best-looking, and smartest family God ever created. They are oblivious to an outside world that variously treats them with bewilderment, astonishment, and sometimes outright contempt. Doesn't faze them in the slightest. The early seventies, when the original series prospered, were a strange time anyway. In a way, the sixties hadn't really ended. Disco and Saturday Night Live were yet to come. 'The Brady Bunch' was the latest of a type of show that had been a staple of network television since its inception, the family situation comedy. 'Father Knows Best,' 'The Donna Reed Show,' and of course 'Leave It To Beaver' were the prototypes. One might think 'The Brady Bunch' would have been the last of its breed, but the format's enduring appeal lived on in such shows as 'Eight Is Enough' and 'Full House.' 'The Brady Bunch' is definitely an artifact of its time though, more noticeably so than the other examples given, given the 60's background and affectations in dress, hairstyles, and dialogue. So bringing this determinedly odd and stupid family into the 90's was a stroke of genius, and what resulted was a sharp parody that made a lot of money and was followed by a sequel. Some of the best bits include continual run-ins with their neighbor, Mr. Dittmeyer, and his boozy, lustful wife, who clearly wishes to engage in a threesome with Greg and Peter. The Brady's astroturf lawn is still there, and another neighbor comments in amazement, One time I was over there. One bathroom for nine people? And I never did see a toilet. Then there's Greg Brady's line to several female classmates, Hey there, groovy chicks. You're all hep in far out ways. And Marcia's comforting words to Jan, who is worried about moving because she'll have to make new friends. Jan, you don't have any friends. 'The Brady Bunch Movie' is a funny flick bound to send you away muttering, Marcia, Marcia, Marcia!

The Bradys are still living like it's the 1970s but it's 1995. They wear the terrible 70s fashions, are all squeaky clean and friendly and are totally oblivious that the times have changed. Various plots from the old TV show are used and the reactions from 1990s people are frequently hilarious. However this is probably only for a select audience. I grew up watching it on TV when I was in grade school and saw it constantly in reruns when I was in junior high and high school. Therefore I have mostly every episode memorized. The movie has plenty of in jokes for fans of the series and people like me (I sort of like the show but I'm no fan). So if you're not familiar with the Bradys or the show you might not like it. I originally caught this at a theatre back in 1995. It was wall to wall baby boomers and college kids. When the title song came on the whole audience joined in loudly and loved the whole movie! So I think most people will like it and get it.The whole cast looks almost exactly like their TV counterparts with the sole exception of Gary Cole who looks nothing like Robert Reed. On the other hand Shelley Long is a dead ringer for Florence Henderson. The Brady house looks exactly like it did in the TV show--heck, they even use the same music! Also there are cameos from various original cast members and other 70s stars (like Davy Jones and the Monkees). There are also a few dance and song numbers (all from the original show) that are energetic and colorful (if you ignore the inane lyrics). There's also a few gay positive characters squeezed in. There's a lesbian school mate after Marcia (who's totally oblivious) and an interracial gay couple living on the same street as the Bradys. I personally LOVE this movie and think it's hysterical.

Especially when the first descriptions said Marcia would have a gay girlfriend... I just thought the whole thing would be sickening. I was wrong.The beauty of this movie is that they take the Brady Bunch, right out of 1970, and drop them into 1995. HOW such a thing could be, I can't say, but it was a brilliant idea. Somehow, in the middle of the 1990's, the Brady family is firmly entrenched in 1970. They've got the cars, the clothes, the music, it's like the whole world around them doesn't exist! They either don't notice, or don't care. For example, Greg drives Marcia to their high school in Mrs. Brady's station wagon and along the way they are listening to an 8 track tape of Davy Jones singing. WHERE would they get an 8 track tape like that - and in 1995?! Well, don't worry too much about that, just accept it and laugh at it. Okay, so they get to school and Marcia says she has written to Davy Jones to see if he will sing at their school's dance. Greg scoffs at the idea because 'a big star like that is too busy to come to our dance!' I mean, where do they see Davy Jones as a star at all in the 1990's? He's got no hits, you'd never see him on TV... yet to the Brady's, he is a superstar and they are playing 8 track tapes of him gotten from who-knows-where.Where would they get their flare-bottom pants and gaudy patterned clothes? The square-toed mid-heel shoes? The paisley shirts? Their cars are right out of 1970 or so (though not the same cars they drove on the TV show). Where? When? How? You don't ask such questions, you just accept and laugh at the insanity of it all.The beauty of this movie is watching the 1970 Brady Family as they interact with the world around them which is 25 years further along. Okay, they do put some edge on the family members and they do get a little fun poked at them - like when Greg as Johnny Bravo gets up to perform at his school dance and says 'I wrote this song for the grooviest chick at Westdale High' and girls run screaming out of the gymnasium. And the drunk woman who lives next door has the hots for Mr. Brady - and Greg - and even Peter.It's a really funny movie. I never thought I'd have liked it but when I finally watched it, I realized what an ingenious idea it was. There is a sequel to this movie which IMO is one of the reasons sequels are usually no good, just an attempt to cash in on a good original.Finally, even as this movie makes fun of the Brady family, it does so with some heart. The humor is good-natured; the family members are still all likable and are treated with affection even as they are the source of the humor. If you always loved the Brady Bunch, this movie won't anger you by the way they were treated. Yes, the joke is on them, but they're laughing along with us - even if they don't get the joke in quite the same way we do. I like this movie!

The movie starts by portraying a typical day in the nineties, but for the Brady's- it's anything but. The next door neighbors have been getting so much of their mail, that they've been missing property tax slips. And thus, they have failed to pay. This is great news to Mr. Dittmeyer, who has been trying to get Mike Brady to sell his house so he can have a mini-mall built. So, the Brady clan has to come up with a way to acquire $20,000 by the deadline, or Dittmeyer gets their house.The plot is not the most enticing reason to see this movie. Instead, there is a real networking subplot about a family from the seventies not trying to fit in, but are content in their own little world. One-liners galore, and the sibling relationships make for extra fun because though the story involves two families who merged together while their oldest kids are in their mid-teens- they all treat each other like natural brothers and sisters.Marcia is shallow as Hal. Her whole worthiness to herself never gets old. Her best friend tells her that she is the prettiest girl in the school, to which she replies, I know. The question on all of our minds is- but how can she use her good looks and sparkling personality to earn money? Jan is rad as a fad with her multiple personalities. One encourages her, the second insults her, the third suggests she act in rage. Watch my head spin! Kill! Kill! Kill! That line is a comment on The Exorcist. Cindy has a funny lisp, and the rest of the kids are boring. But, this movie doesn't waste time on boring kids. And that's what's so great about it. The music is great corny fun... I suggest you see the movie and scream out the lines, It's me! The New Jan Brady! Let's knock over a 7-11. Stop, you're scaring me! Me too. ME TOO!!!!*** out of **** "},{"Title":"Marcia! Marcia!

NO! Don't think for a second that was it , cause it's not , okay? It's still as annoying as it ever was. That's not gonna change. But It's simple really , I mean when I saw that film. It had Brady Bunch all over it! You know , sometimes they make movies off of t.v shows Rugrats , Southpark , Bevis and Butthead , The Flinstones, the characters might be the same , but the plot similarities are as distinct as girls going out on a date with Brad Pitt , and then another one going out with Mr. Bean. You are defiantly able to tell the difference. (I sure hope so) and you get reviews like This movie is nothing like that t.v show! It sucked!! Well , not to praise the The Brady Bunch Movie anymore than I already have, but this has the exact same sappy jokes or situational comedy that we've all grown to know and hate. Marcia , Marcia , Marcia Oww , my nose! The pitfall come on , you've been in that bathroom for ages (You would think that 20 years later they would build a new bathroom!!) The voice overs , The songs, It all fits in perfectly! Now here we have the Brady Bunch still dressed up form the 70's and their infamous catch-phrases. He is SO dreamy That's like having Elton John trying to fit in with the world , that's EXACTLY what makes this film entertaining. Everyone else lives in the 90's while the Brady's fit into a 70's time slot , and are able to capture a realism in the movie. The fact that they used their episodes and somehow were able to fit them into a plot to form a 2 hour movie is uncanny. And the timing is impeccable. They didn't just randomly insert the jokes into the plot line like they did with Austin Power's Goldmember. (No offense to Austin Power's fans , but come on) If you noticed , they pretty much poked fun of everything you can think of. Their style , culture , society , music , catch-phrases , affection , behavior , other sucked it dry like Anna Nicole sucks the cream out of a twinkie without breaking the crust. In other words , they beat the living #### out themselves. And for all that it's worth , I think after seeing ALL THAT ,you do have to feel sorry for them , and pity them for what they made in the 70's. I'm sure now that it's too late the producers said What were we thinking? I thought that I wasn't going to like the movie since I never liked the Brady Bunch , but I was wrong , I was in for a good surprise , I often found myself mocking the jokes from the Brady Bunch Movie with a few other friends.

Spot on. 10/10.","Date":"22 July 2002","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  After almost 30 years, Sherwood Schwartz, the still living original creator of The Brady Bunch TV series finally got a feature film of his show off the ground. Amazingly, The Brady Bunch Movie (1995) is very funny and self-mocking, hip fun.The beginning sets the tone, when Mr Ditmeier, the slimy realtor (played by fabulous mockumentarian and the Lenny half of Lenny & Squiggy from TV's Laverne and Shirley, Michael McKean) is trying to explain the Bradys to his client it's like they're not normal. -Why the Hell not? What's their story? comes the opening gambit which then launches us into the familiar Here's a story theme song.The characterizations of the regulars are, this time, much more knowing. For instance, when Cindy lisps out to an uproariously non-comprehending Mr Ditmeier that she wants their misdelivered mail, and he eventually gets it and slaps the bundle down in front of the little girl, he dismissed her with Here. Hit the road, Bad Seed, a hilarious and unexpected reference to the 1985 made-for-TV horror flick starring a Cindy lookalike. But Cindy's killer lines don't end there. She has a barrage of innocently parroted jocular embarrassments in store for everybody Daddy, Mrs Ditmeier said that she'd be glad to wrap your package this Christmas. And Mr Ditmeier says that Mrs Ditmeier is overhung; but he's not in a very good mood because he's taking it in the rear.Mrs Ditmeier (played with broad jadedness by Jean Smart of Designing Women fame) is no shrinking violet either. She gleefully toys with the innocent Brady boys standing on either side of her by suggesting that later, they could all go inside and help her make (become) a sandwich. &#150;Hello.The anachronisms flow thick and fast. Jan is revealed as a paranoid schizophrenic middle child who hears voices, but everything she perceives about her downtrodden status in the family is fully and completely justified. So we get to laugh at ourselves for ever having felt the same way in our own lives. Jan (Jennifer Elise Cox) valiantly bashes into fences, trying to be cool about not wearing her glasses. Her over-prepared and really quite beautiful school counselor, Mrs Cummings (the amazingly well-spackled RuPaul) is hilariously expecting grittier problems than a kid conflicted about wearing glasses.The same technique of underwhelmed grit is used again when Marcia tries to be a teen model but gets some gritty advice about how to improve herself, such as getting a haircut and breast implants. She slaps the image creator (a farcical David Leisure) for daring to suggest she cut her hair!I really love what they do with Jan's inner voices. She first has to sink quite low, and her voices first degenerate into schlock It's me, the new Jan Brady. Let's knock over a 7-11!, urges her Linda Blair-sounding inner voice. Thankfully, it's not allowed to rule Jan for too long. They do settle the sibling rivalry with Marcia quite well. Eventually.Marcia's way cool theme, Venus, the original 1969 version by Shocking Blue, can be heard as she struts in the schoolyard. She is so popular, even amongst her 1990s cynical schoolmates (who just can't believe their eyes), that she actually attracts both sexes. In a very left field characterisation, we see the fabulous Alanna Ubach as Marcia's smitten, and unfortunately very gay best friend, Noreen. Thankfully, Noreen does get lucky with someone much more worthy towards the end of the movie so she doesn't have to feel in any way rejected by the dense and insensitive Marcia. Casting Directors in Hollywood! More Alanna Ubach, please! Ms Ubach is completely adorable - but she's not God. Even she needs *  better material * than the asinine Clockwatchers (1998).A key touch during the movie is the adherence to plot elements from the TV series, such as the Bradys needing $20,000 to save their house, which the kids try to fix on their own by entering a talent contest. Of course, they win, using a terrific Davy Jones /Monkees ploy, again from the TV series. There is another terrific scene where Davy sings a grunged-up Thank You, Girl at Marcia's high school dance, and the schoolkids eventually start to groove to him; but he's a real hit with their female teachers who just about faint! (Hah, I was always a Micky Dolenz type of girl. Still am.) And of course, we get to watch for all the original TV show cast cameos. Florence Henderson, Ann B Davis, Barry Williams, and Christopher Knight all put in quickie appearances (as other characters, of course, which doesn't detract from the new cast at all).As with the TV series, the Bradys' singing and dancing is actually quite crucial to their charm. Their style is of course very, very corny, but it works almost purely due to nostalgia alone. The rest is achieved through primary colour costuming, their height-arranged waddling duckline, and the refreshing naivete that is shown to always work on at least a fraction of their audience.The grunge band that is their main competition is shown to not even deserve winning, because they are full of it it is the cool people who are the real losers instead of everyone else they bitch about.I have to mention one final unexpected slayer joke in an attempt to pep up his entire family, Mr Brady claims that Alone, we can only move buckets. But together, we can drain rivers! &#150;not exactly the ringing endorsement I think we might have hoped for. So I have to commend the two groups of writers for their fabulous, subversive screenplay, which is peppered with similar little gems. It is rare to have so many cooks still not spoiling the broth. The ending addresses the very heart of the whole sibling rivalry issue and manages to make even having to stop seem entirely the right thing. I cannot think of a single gripe about anything. Perfect.

Although they always made up at the end of each episode, they spent the other 20 minutes each day just fighting about bathroom time, missing toys, and pretty much everything else physically possible. So how come the complete 'happiest family in the world' idea? That just sprung to my mind while watching this movie, as I too have always had this view. The main thing that lets the movie down though is the lame slapstick humour that tries to appeal to the under 10's, such as Eric Dittmeyer picking up the electricity cable.

Of course with everything we know about the Bradys now (Robert Reed being gay, Barry Williams book GROWING UP BRADY, the kids all having the hots for each other), this movie takes on even more meaning. The movie is very well cast too. Gary Cole's Robert Reed impression as Mike Brady is frighteningly on the money and Shelley Long is also good as Carol. The kids are well cast too, special mention to Christine Taylor' Marcia (whose physical and vocal resemblance to Maureen McCormick is uncanny)and the brilliant Jennifer Elise Cox, who just about steals the movie as Jan.

It is funny, a simple word but one that really describes the kind humour this is, just funny, not always smart but nevertheless funny as all. It is different in it's way of doing humour, a kind of way in which the 90's are the complete opposite of the 70's Brady family, and the results are at times laugh out loud. Now it isn't side splitting, but I felt it to be pretty good and it has so many various laughs, it just works.The cast do well, very good well maybe not but they do create a certain air of crazy and the situations they get into are sometimes brilliant. Gary Cole as Mike Brady is good and the way in which he portrays him is very calm but often funny. The entire family are funny, as said not always cry out loud humour but still laughs a plenty and some are silly, some are smart but even silly ones won't make you feel bad for laughing at them.Not the smartest movie as said, well done yes but as many critics of the day said, it is too silly. It isn't slapstick jokes(well some can be) but there not in massive quantity. I do feel it was written smartly by the numerous writers who seem to collaborate well and really are the people who make the great lines and of which most of the stupid jokes, but funny, are made. The culture clash of the film is what makes this what it is, I can't say this is exactly like the TV show but the way in which they kind of bring them back from the past in a new setting makes this even better, a great decision by someone.Now the direction isn't always done well, it creates some good humour but also creates some of the worst. This movie isn't always great to review as there is very little to say, but one thing is that the jokes can, now I repeat can be hit and miss but still remain fairly well done and the movie is as always I have said, a funny one.I recommend this to people who like good old humour, not a comedy wasting around trying to create a smart plot or anything, just comedy that makes you chuckle but not over think things. The actual plot is not exactly exciting but that's the good thing for me, it focuses on making you laugh more than thrilling or entertaining with boring and seen before plots so common of the day.Overall a kind of good movie and one that although not entirely brilliant, still a movie that should entertain and if a fan of the original series, please watch it. This movie even has a sequel so you can see that people did enjoy the humour and do like the film so please disregard any poor reviews but also don't listen to one's that say this is flawless, in fact my review is pretty worthless too but make your own mind up on this one and if you find it funny too.

You're not going to watch the Brady Bunch movie! You're sick! My response is that he is just a blind idiot that thinks style is everything that is him and if nobody conforms to him then they have a problem. Okay, the Brady Bunch movie is not the best of all movies, but it is funny in a very satirical sort of way.I never watched the Brady Bunch when I was young, and never really liked it, but I thought the clever part of the movie was trapping them in the 70's and bringing them into the nineties. This movie looks at the 90's in a very satirical sort of way, yet the Bradys are completely innocent and don't realise that the world has changed. Where everybody is playing heavy metal and chasing same sex relationships, the Brady's still think Davey Jones is a hit and consider a kiss at the door is the furthest one should go on the first date (not that I really disagree with this, but being 26, one no longer dates, but rather forms relationships with the people around me and we simply get to know each other, but then I'm not exactly the one who knows everything about dating).This seems to be the style that movies move, or the way that I think they should movie, focusing more on satire. Thomas in this movie is clashing the ideal family with the reality of the 90's. It is an attack on the American Dream, and even though they win through in the end, the entire situation is so absurd that one has not option but to laugh. The patriotic speech is a little annoying and creates an unrealistic feel that props up the American Dream once again. I feel that everything that is done to undermine the dream through the movie is completely destroyed by the speech. Then I think that it is something that would detract from a Brady Bunch Movie anyway. But when I consider the speech, it is creating the ideal again, what should be and is not. We should have our neighbourhood and should be allowed to live there in peace, but we all know that it is not true. What happened to the Bradys was absurd, but we know that in reality this will never happen. The point of this is to drag the stupidity of the situation to an extreme end so as to show how stupid it really is. This reminds me that I should sit down and write the drama script in this light, stretching the stupidity to the absolute absurdity.

The two headed up a cast that really satirized the famous sugary sitcom that Paramount television brought us from 1969 to 1974, The Brady Bunch.Time has stood still for the family in The Brady Bunch Movie. Gary Cole and Shelley Long have raised their blended family right from the Seventies. The parents and kids listen to the music, dress in the fashion and behave otherwise as if the Eighties and Nineties just never took place. The kids stand out quite a bit from their peers in their suburban school.The main plot such as it is has the Bradys being under siege by their neighbors, the Dittmyers, Michael McKean and Jean Smart who need the Brady home in order to complete a big real estate deal. They'll get it by fair means or foul. The Dittmyers are best described as poor relations of that other TV family, the Bundys.A big part of the problem with this film is that you would have to have been a fan of the show and presumably have seen it in reruns a gazillion times on the TVLand channel in order to appreciate it. About 15 of the various episodes are used in creating the plot. That's a component that someone who never saw the show couldn't possibly get.Still some of the sly innuendo also comes from the Nineties culture with RuPaul as the school guidance counselor eying Christopher Daniel Barnes as Greg and a young lesbian girl carrying a big old torch for Marcia played by Christine Taylor. Jennifer Elise Cox has taken over nicely the role of the ever dissatisfied middle sister Jan who the real and original Carol Brady as the grandmother finally deals with in the appropriate manner.As in any of the television Brady episodes goodness and vacuity ultimately triumph and to find out how and which episode plot lines are used to bring that about, you'll have to sit back and enjoy the big screen version of America's most famous blended family.

Marcia's voice is hauntingly the same as the one from the sixties. The film's plot matches the sappy plots from the shows in the sixties. For the film, they strung along highlights from our favorite episodes, and even my favorite Brady song - It's a Sunshine Day.

Well my biggest wish has come true, thanks to Hollywood, gotta love them for that.The Brady Bunch Movie is kinda the same as the TV show, you gotta see the TV show to understand the movie. Let me tell you, I haven't seen every episode of the series, only about 10-15 of them, and I loved the movies.Gary Cole got to give him hands down, he did awesome. I didn't think that anybody could do an awesome job, well like Robert Reed, but he did awesome. I actually found his portrayal of Mike Brady more believable than Robert's hmmm.Shelley Long did a great portrayal of Carol Brady, she even looks just like Florence Henderson did in the original, love the flip hair-do too. Along with Shelley and Gary the rest of the cast was dead-on.I can't tell you the story line, because it would give away the movie and I don't wanna do that, I want you guys to go out and see the movie. So here's what I will tell you, the acting was incredible, much better than the original series, there were a lot of better jokes as well. The story line was very well done, and it didn't skip a beat. I got to give it to the designer/set guys they did awesome, I wonder if they borrowed stuff from the set of the Brady Bunch because everything looked like it.Anyways, this movie is great, it's one of the best movies based on a TV series, what am I talking about, it is the best! I loved it, had a great time sharing my time at home with the Brady's. So once again Hollywood, thanks for making my biggest wish come true.

Snippets like Bobby saving a girl from a falling shelf, orange hair and some sort of model volcano explosion. Nothing very distinctive at all. So when the movie came out in '95, I gave it a shot and didn't like it at all. It just seemed like another fish-out-of-water movie, and the jokes were of the inside type, which was to be expected for a movie based on a TV show. They just weren't funny. So I dismissed the movie (which apparently was pretty popular) and didn't even bother with it's sequel, which came out the next year.Fast forward ten years to 2005. Thanks to the wonders of TV-on-DVD, I took another shot and bought the 1st season of The Brady Bunch and immediately got hooked. As I watched the episodes,those snippets suddenly became cohesive and the memories flowed back in. The warm, fuzzy, memories of a simpler time with the impossibly perfect family. As I eagerly awaited the subsequent season releases over the next year and a half, I held off on giving The Brady Bunch Movie a second chance until I had seen every episode again. I'm glad I did. Basically what I'm trying to say is that you definitely need to be familiar with the show, to fully appreciate the movie(s).As I mentioned previously the movie takes the fish-out-of-water, squeaky-clean 70's Brady's and places them in the 90's. While you get your usual riffs on the culture clash enveloped in a pedestrian plot (albeit, their oblivious attitude is good for some laughs), the real comedic meat comes from the spoofing of the show. Swollen noses, squeaky voices, inner monologues, Marcia, Marcia, Marcia, the life lessons, the clothes, breaking into song. It's all there in their glorious cheesiness, deftly presented by the cast, with special kudos going to the spot-on portrayals of Mr. & Mrs. Brady, Marcia, Jan & Alice. Actually Ben Stiller probably says to himself every day, I can't believe I landed Marcia Brady! Christine Taylor IS Marcia Brady. And look for some great cameos as well.Good, hilarious fun for Brady fans. Of course after this, I just had to run out and get A Very Brady Sequel, which is even better! Incest! The real Mr. Brady! Cousin Oliver! Oh my!

I was eleven years do when The Brady's went off the air. I was too young to know just how funny the show really was. The Brady Bunch Movie is by far the best theatrical remake/parody of a 1970's TV ever made. First, there's the brilliant idea to set the film in contemporary 1995 and allows the BRADY's to be the anachronism. A fact to which they're totally, wonderfully oblivious to. Everyone else lives for today, but the Brady's are still a quarter century out of sync. This allows for one of the great rules of comedy to work perfectly. The Rule There's nothing funnier that watching someone watch someone else lose their mind. John Clesse said that (or close to it) but it's so true. Watching the reactions everyone has to the Brady's and their 70s ways are side splitting. Possibly the funniest bit is the simplest. Cindy Brady strolls over to the next door neighbors to bring them some undelivered mail. She walks through her own backyard, a poorly lit indoor TV studio set complete with an Astoturf lawn that sports rather obvious seams where it's been stitched together. She then passes trough the hedges onto the neighbors property and she ACTUALLY IS outside for real! Subtle, but hilarious! To have done the film straight as if the TV series never ended would have been embarrassing. Here we have the best of both worlds. Casual fans can laugh at the razor sharp satire, and long time fans can enjoy the trip down memory lane and still enjoy the good natured satirical humor! The cast is amazing! I realize that they can do anything these days, but it still must have been difficult to find actors that not only resembled the originals, but that were enough off kilter enough to make the satire work. My favorite line comes near the start as Marsha is walking through the high school campus as she draws longing stares from just about every guy who lays eyes on her. One remarks That's Marsha Brady. She's harder to get into than a Pearl Jam concert!

The Brady Bunch Movie is one that got it right. Even people who don't know the original series - or hold it in low regard - can admire this movie. You see, the problem with most TV show adaptations is that they transpose the characters to the modern world, thereby taking them out of context. This movie has the eponymous wholesome family living in the 1990s but time-locked in the 1970s, thus enabling a comparison/contrast between the two eras.The plot has the Bradys trying to keep from getting evicted, while Jan gets jealous of Marcia and Greg tries to start up a career as a singer. There are some scenes taken straight from the show, such as what happens to Marcia's nose, and Cindy having to learn about tattling.

(spoilers)","Date":"17 August 2004","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  The Brady Bunch is one of the best spoofs ever, taking the perpetually 1970s Brady family and transplanting them into a hostile, sometimes mellow, and altogether bizarre 1990s Southern California atmosphere.Pulling together references to many episodes, the Brady Bunch Movie concerns the Brady's family desperate attempt to raise $20,000 for the back taxes owed on their house and avoid foreclosure. Larry Ditmeyer, the invariably scheming neighbor (played by Laverne and Shirley co-star, Michael McKean), hopes that he can prevent the Brady's from getting hold of the money too soon, because he wants to buy up the property (the last on the block after convincing everyone else to sell) and make his boss happy.The better parts of the movie however, are not from the main plot (and in spoofs, the main plot is hardly the funniest part of the movie because it is almost always character rather than situation driven). First, the absolutely nerdy Greg Brady (Christopher Daniel Barnes) has plans to become hip rock star (in a Seattle grunge dominated music decade), Johnny Bravo.Marcia (Christine Taylor) has two dilemmas first, she accepts two guys invitation to the dance (it seems only sitcom safe Marcia could worry about monogomy in the 90s), scrawny Charlie (R.D. Robb who was the I double dog dare ya kid in the holiday cult classic, A Christmas Story), and arrogant jock and big man on campus, Doug Simpson (Shane Conrad). Her other earth shaking problem is getting Davey Jones (yes, the real Monkees) to come to the school dance. Equally geek pre-pubescent Paul Sutera is Peter Brady, a guy with a serious hormone imbalance who falls for Holly (played by Marissa Ribisi), girlfriend of Peter's hostile Ditmeyer neighbor, Eric (James Noseworthy).Although Marica's character is so achingly bubbly and conceited (making her perfectly funny as disaster happens around her to which she is oblivious to), I liked her secretly lesbian friend, Noreen (played by former Beakman's World assistant, Alanna Ubach), who likes Marcia, and even helps her out of a jam with that idiot Doug Simpson. She's really funny.Jennifer Elise Cox does the best job in the whole movie as the greatest character spoof, playing the ridiculously self-conscious and low self esteem teen Jan Brady. She spends the movie trying very hard to get herself recognized and break out of her middle child syndrome (why doesn't Peter have this problem?). Her guidance counselor is Mrs. Cummings, played by RuPaul. (And girl, you better work it!). In fact, her invisibility to everyone causes some very hilarious moments of delusional schizophrenia. (Says the evil Jan in one scene Look at me, I'm the new Jan Brady. Let's go knock over a 7-11!). Shelly Long and Gary Cole are fantastic (and amazing replicas) of the out-of-touch mother and father of the family, Carol and Mike Brady. Mike, the architect, hopes he can design an acceptable commercial building (all looking like his house, of course, since it's the only design he's ever made reference to making) in order to get a pay advance and cover the taxes on the house before foreclosure. I love how the mother always does this you're father's right business to everything Mike Brady says, even though no one knows what he's talking about or when he has stated the obvious. That's about the time when the kids easily submit with, gee...I never thought of it that way.If you think the Brady Bunch were ahopelessly corny and terribly safe moralistic sitcom family (especially given that they were on television in the 1970, the same time as shows like 'All in the Family' and 'Maude'), then this is a film recommended for you. They really stick out like a sore thumb. (Holly says to the guys after they're checking out Marcia Brady, I think Peter's a babe...in a Gilligan sort of way. Eric responds, what are you? braindead!). Look for cameos from former the Brady Bunch cast as well as those of other 1970s sitcoms (Barry Williams, who was the original Greg Brady, shows up as a music producer and actually rejects the spoofed Greg Brady's request for an audition; Christopher Knight has a blink-and-you-miss him part as a school coach who tells Ditmeyer to stop picking on Peter Brady; Anne B. Davis who was the original Alice the maid shows up as a truck driver who gives Jan a lift; and Florence Henderson plays Grandma Brady). This movie promises a lot of laughs, and everything the Bradys do is so stupid, that's why it is so funny. (Don't miss Jean Smart as Ditmeyer's alcoholic wife Mrs. Brady sure is lucky to have a big strong, virile man around the house.)If you love spoofs, don't miss this one!

There's a less obvious reason to do with one's lack of control.  At home one has the freedom to get up and walk around, stop watching for a few minutes, skip the dull bits, mentally tune out, and (assuming it's not a broadcast) fast-forward.  This freedom is a BAD thing.  Anyone who wants to watch a movie at all, dammit, should be (so to speak) strapped to his seat and FORCED to watch the WHOLE THING.  Some films - some very good films - make us all flinch or wince a little bit, and the temptation to avoid what makes us flinch or wince, when we are free to do so, is too great for any of us to resist.  Take, for example, this film.  At first glance you'd think it was a perfect example of a movie you might as well see at home - it's hardly Lawrence of Arabia - but I'm sorry I saw it on television.  I wish I'd been FORCED to endure ever single second of thorough-going Bradiness.

When I saw the movie, all my fears were put to rest. In fact, some of the culture clash scenes of the Bradys interacting with the rest of the world were the best, such as McKean's character not understanding a word of what she's saying because of her lisp, an attempted carjack Well, this is a car.

The period detail is great (now that I see it as an adult, I realize the Brady's house was actually pretty cool looking), including the costumes. There's some little sexual innuendo thrown in, but it fits in with the movie and the characters perfectly-one of the funniest scenes is when Carol and Mike think they're alone, and she's sitting on his lap whispering what is probably talking dirty in his ear, and he's saying Uh-huh...You would...I see... exactly like Mike Brady does when he's talking to someone on the phone. They include the popular Brady songs like Sunshine Day (always kind of grated on me, but they do a great version in a Sears store) and the horrible one that starts Clowns never laughed before... but Keep On is actually a pretty catchy one. They recreate many famous moments from the show, such as Marcia's nose getting broken (Oh!My nose!) to Jan's delight, potato sack races, Jan hating her new glasses, Peter (or is it Bobby-for some reason those are the only 2 names I can't keep straight) being the Safety Monitor at school, and plenty more. The plot (yes, it actually has one)involves the Brady family's efforts to save their beloved home from an evil land-developer. Highly recommended, even if you're not a Brady completist. Watch for the cameos from 4 original cast members-the best was the real Alice playing a truck driver (hmmm, always though Alice was a little butch) picking up hitch-hiking Jan who has run away from home.  Most importantly to me, though this is a parody, the moviemakers make fun of the show while still staying true to the spirit of it and the characters. All their naivete (spelled wrong, I know...) is actually sweet rather than annoying-Marcia wears hideous 70's clothes but carries herself like a princess, Greg wants to make friends with the car-jacker, assuming he must need a spare tire, Mike explains how he wouldn't sell his house for any price because he designed it himself with love. During one scene, Marcia and Jan go to a modeling tryout (Jan is instantly booted)and the photographer/agent tells her she needs to cut her hair, get plastic surgery, and lose weight. She slaps, him horrifiedCUT MY HAIR?? How dare you! Greg's lines to pick up chicks (well, it seems like this is his only opening pickup line) is Hey groovy chick. You look really happening in a far out way! are actually endearing.Everyone with a sense of humor and fun will probably like this movie, and those of us who grew up on the show will absolutely love it.

It looks like the 1970's sitcom yet it plunders in despair of various episodes forming to create a lame story. The Brady family try to save their house from being auctioned off by a greedy neighbour. Director Betty Thomas succeeds in placing the sitcom setting within the reality of change that the family fails to adapt to. The performances would be great if the actors were given anything to do. Gary Cole and Shelley Long play Mike and Carol Brady who couldn't find their way out of a closet with the door open. Among the many children are Christopher Daniel Barnes who dreams of becoming a rock star so that he can wow the girls who think he has no talent. Christine Taylor plays Marcia who combs her hair 500 strokes. That sounds like someone who has too much time on her hands. Michael McKean is featured as the villain out to get their home as well as others in the neighbourhood. Its purpose is to celebrate a successful sitcom, which they shamelessly tarnish with elements of current lifestyles. The clean humour of the original sitcom is replaced with corny sexual references and bathroom humour that have no place within a family like this.

Directed by Betty Thomas, who did a great job with The Late Shift, the film pokes delirious fun at the sugary lifestyle of the Bradys by placing them in a '90's atmosphere, letting them stick out like a bunch of very sore thumbs. Shelley Long and Gary Cole (doing a great job impersonating Robert Reed) play the mom and pop with great poise and exact timing. The kids are also great look-alikes, especially Jan (Marcia, Marcia,Marcia!). The real hoot of the cast is Michael McKean as the next-door neighbour who detests the goodie-goodies next door. While The Brady Bunch does have a good idea in paralleling the two cultural strains of yesterday and today, it also does not have a great deal of big laughs to speak of. I must say I am glad that this did not end up like a lot of other send-offs of this type, and follow up with a turgid rehash of Home Alone (think Dennis the Menace), but it also does not cover enough ground for one to write home about it. A much better film of this type, Pleasantville, captures this idea with much greater momentum and integrity. Rating Two stars.

The singular gag is that the geeky Brady's are now living in the 90's, but still every bit as 70's as they were twenty years ago.The casting crew have done a marvellous job locating the look-a-likes required, and have excelled themselves in the Marcia, Jan and Cindy departments. Shelley Long's Carol Brady is great while both the original mom and Alice make surprise cameos.Not a great deal to get excited about comedy wise, but enough to keep one awake, and seemingly enough to justify subjecting a new generation of young viewers to the Brady Bunch by resurrecting the old tele shows.Saturday, March 11, 1995 - UA Theatre, Anaheim, USA "},{"Title":"Clothes Continuity -  A nod to the TV show","Date":"5 April 2005","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" A previous visitor commented on the continuity issue When Jan runs into Mr. Ditmeyer's car and breaks his mirror, she is dressed in the same outfit (green turtleneck, crochet vest, and blue plaid pants) that she wore in the opening scenes of the movie, but all the other characters have already been seen dressed in different outfits, suggesting it's a new day.

Its testament to success was the traditional American values and family morals which Sherwood Schwartz and his crew work so diligently to preserve, and they certainly succeeded.The Brady Bunch Movie has a stunningly realistic feel in both the casting, scripts, and story-lines. The actors' personalities and actions are jaw-droopingly close to the original series! You could tell that the producers of The Brady Bunch Movie payed close attention to many of the familiar story-lines and character situations.Note that in order for the movie viewer to appreciate how brilliantly the characters and scenes look, you MUST be familiar with the series such as the problems with Cindy's tattling, Bobby upset for being a school Safety Monitor, Greg being chosen to represent the big singing star in rock and roll, Johnny Bravo, and, in a standout reenactment, Jan's anger and jealousy over constantly being compared to her sister Marcia.The story centers on the Brady neighbors the Dittmeyer's involved in a scheme, where Mr. Dittmeyer as a greedy land developer wants to buy up all the properties on his block, forcing the Brady's to flee their suburban home because they have been unable to pay their $20,000 back fees in property taxes. When not reenacting a classic Brady moment, you have the movie characters trying to figure out what they can do to raise enough money to save their home. Classic Brady songs such as Sunshine Day and Keep On add to the groovy fun of the movie.However, there are some crude sex-jokes innuendo that hurt the other redeeming qualities of the film, which were totally unnecessary and out of place. When this movie first came out, I read that the original script was very raunchy for a PG-13 rating. Sherwood Schwartz was rightly outraged and worked with the producers to clean up some of the content. Unfortunately, there are still some dialogs that would certainly NOT be appropriate for children under 13. Parents or guardians should supervise viewing of this movie for anyone under 13. Very young children, because of the sexual innuendo, should avoid this picture completely, and that is a sad comment to write when talking about what is supposed to be wholesome family entertainment like The Brady Bunch. Removing the sex-gag humor would have helped this movie a lot, making it the kind of family movie that Sherwood and his staff would have wanted. They may have cleaned up the original script, but not enough for younger viewers.Love the movie for its casting mannerisms of the family, in addition to the great believability of the characters in playing the original Brady roles to near perfection. Great detail as well to the set designs of the original Brady house. However the PG-13 humor taints the movie's enjoyment.For the greatest Brady Bunch moments of all time, it is best to stick with the original classic series.

This movie is about a wholesome family, but the writers subtly point out how goofy the premise and apple pie characters from the original series are. It's a tribute and a spoof, and a downright fun movie.The Brady's are in debt for 20,000 dollars and will lose their home if they can't pay off the money. Amidst the chaos though, the family is together and fine, and stays cool. Carol and Mike Brady are married and have their six kids, and everything is fine. The doorbell rings, and it's Carol's dead husband at the door, here to see his girls. Apparently he wasn't dead, which means Mike and Carol were never married. But fiendishly, the man claiming to be Carol's dead husband is just a man after an antique horse worth 20 million dollars in the Brady house. Many silly sub-plots ensue, like Marcia and Greg falling for each other and Jan making up a boyfriend.All throughout, this movie was silly fun. The Brady family was written how the family was written on the T.V. show (minus a few mildly suggestive innuendos), but the other characters are written like normal people. The Brady's are off in their early 70s dream world, where everyone else is living in the 90s. It sounds dumb, but it was a good idea. The actors all look like their 70s counterparts. In fact, they're all pretty dead on with personalities and looks. The jokes almost all come from the ridiculousness of the premise, and most of them hit well. It's a spoof of a show with an all too positive outlook on everything, and it's very funny.One small thing I found odd was a shared cameo by Zsa Zsa Gabor and Rosie O'Donnel. It just seemed like a weird duo, but whatever.Overall, this movie didn't take itself too seriously, and because of this it's lighthearted fun.My rating *** out of ****. 100 mins.

Seems the wholesome Brady clan is stuck in a '70s time-warp, and they are completely unaware of the changing times and modern predicaments (such as carjacking, grunge bands, lesbian advances and the fact that Davy Jones is no longer a rock star). Carefully-picked cast members have the look and groovy idiom down perfectly, and they are complimented further by recognizable faces in most of the supporting roles, but the plot (about evil next-door neighbors the Dittmeyers trying to oust the Bradys from their home) is just an outline, hung with familiar jokes and situations from the series. As a TV family, the Bradys (and wisecracking maid, Alice) were so dogged in their corny saintliness that they didn't allow for much excitement (they weren't fish out of water so much as fish underwater); director Betty Thomas can't really juice up their lives here either, and so juxtaposes Mike's job at the office and the kids' lives at school with the harsh realities of 1995--and it's a depressing contrast. The thing certainly looks good (great care was taken to reproduce the Bradys' world down to the smallest detail), but the film cannot sustain itself on visual gags and innuendos alone. **1/2 from **** "},{"Title":"Oh my God I'm trippin' with the Bradys...and it's awesome!!!","Date":"22 February 2014","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" This movie was really one of the first spoof movies that took an old show and put it into the modern age while at the same time lampooning it's more innocent and serious namesake.

This coupled with the cameos from former members of the original show along with other stars makes for some pretty entertaining laughs.

It's like one of those episodes the cartoons HAVE to have The Ol' Switcheroo, etc.       Well, the movie seems to be a success with the other IMDB members, SO if you like Stupid, Retarded, Plain, Boring, Repetitive Hippie crud, Watch this. If you don't, look at this movie and shudder. This one has replaced Freddy krueger and the Teletubbies from my Nightmares.              My Rating -100/10 "},{"Title":"What a waste of time and money","Date":"31 October 1999","Score":"0 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  For the life of me, I cannot understand how anyone could find this movie funny. Sure, it has plenty of humor. But the humor is mostly painful and you laugh simply out of the compulsion to do so. The time warp concept of THE BRADY BUNCH MOVIE doesn't work. I wish people would realize that the 1970s was NOT a time of peace and flower power and everyone loving each other. On the contrary, it was a decade of war protests, economic slumber, racial strife, energy crises, political scandal, rising crime rates, and overall moral decay. In a word, the '70s were just like the stereotypical portrayal of the '90s in this movie. The Brady Bunch was simply a way of coping with all of that. In 1969, there were very few families like the Bradys. Yes, in the '70s Americans had to deal with homosexuality and greedy land developers and all of the other '90s stuff seen in this movie. It is the cultural naiveté of whoever made this movie remake that ruins the satire. Yeah, I know it's just a juvenile movie. But the scary thing is that it was made by adults. You can see a similar weak attempt at humor in PLEASANTVILLE. Contrary to what the TV shows proclaimed, the 1950s were NOT a time of conformity and social vacuum. I wish people would stop resurrecting old TV shows and turning them into movies. They end up giving us false impressions about the past.

Sure the half an hour I spent watching this entertained me, but it seemed a little off. The cast was much better in the original, if you watch it you will see what I mean. They are good, but in my opinion only Shelly Long is similar to her character, but Florence Henderson was better. Personelly the movie would be 5 time better if the whole family, but Shelly Long was re-cast and the script was more like the original. I am not saying that this movie is not worth your time, but if you can be watching the original Brady Bunch I personally recommend it instead.2/10 "},{"Title":"stupid","Date":"4 July 2003","Score":"1 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  Well, even though some of my favorite actors are in this movie Gary Cole and Christine Taylor, this was a very stupid movie. The Brady Bunch in the 90's wouldn't work and it didn't here, but I did like the casting here that is about the only thing I really liked about this movie. The Brady Bunch Movie annoyed me so much I didn't bother to see the sequel, the high 5 rating is a little kind. "}]
