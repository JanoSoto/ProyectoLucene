[{"Title":"A priceless moment in Australian Cinematic History","Date":"31 January 2003","Score":"62 out of 65 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, History","Review":" The Dish delivers the way some of Michael Crichton's best novels do  Take a true story and build fiction around it so you can entertain the reader/viewer with technical accuracy and focus on the fictional characters, and the role they play. And boy, does The Dish entertain.First credit must go to Rob Sitch's absolutely brilliant direction. On one hand it comes as no surprise that part of the old D-Generation line-up (Rob Sitch, Santo Cilauro, Tom Gleisner, Jane Kennedy) wrote a comedy full of sharp wit in the tradition of the infamous Late Show that ran on the ABC (Ch 2) in 1992-1993. Glen's (Tom Long) question Who's the guy ?, when Al (Patrick Warburton) volunteers his admiration for Neil Armstrong and that he'll be walking on the moon is on a par with the Late Show It's academic 1993 sketch where the Santo/Rob/Tom Ivanhoe College team is faced with the challenge  How much change do you receive from 7 Dollars if you purchase 7 items at 98 Cents each ? - Rob's answer  What are the items ?  is unforgettable.That same team performed at its best yet when The Dish's script was written. The Dish is also quite unique as a movie that can be watched over and over again without the need to skip many parts of the story. This could mainly be attributed to the story's characters, and how we are compelled to care about each and every one of them, no matter how insignificant they might seem.The core of The Dish revolves around Neil Armstrong's first historic steps on the Moon at 1256 PM, Monday 21 July 1969 AEST. When 600 Million people (1/5th of mankind at that time) tuned in and witnessed the TV pictures from the Eagle Lunar Module, 3 tracking stations were receiving these signals simultaneously. They were CSIRO's Parkes Radio Telescope, Honeysuckle Creek tracking Station near Canberra and NASA's Goldstone station in California. During the first 9 minutes of the broadcast, NASA alternated between these 3 stations. When they switched to the Parkes pictures, they were of such superior quality that NASA remained with them for the rest of the 2 1/2 hour Moonwalk. Of course the audience knows the good outcome to the events, so the writers can fully focus on the fictional part of the story and remind us how human nature can marvel by putting a man on the moon and safely return him home.The Dish is so refreshing because it doesn't need to resort to adult themes, violence or excessive profanity to flag your attention to the townfolk of Parkes, their involvement in the mission and how they are over the moon about it.The film accurately portrays the spirit of Aussie people in 1969. I found the camerawork simply stunning at times, capturing the beauty of Parkes  the dusty road to the Telescope, the farmer with dog and sheep, the (empty) Fuel station and Parkes' sleepy shops. The wonderful soundtrack attends to the missing pieces with songs like Good morning Star shine and Come on. Dramatization is resourcefully completed by Edmund Choi's composition and direction of The Melbourne Symphony Orchestra (under Jane Kennedy's guidance).The Dish succeeds in a non-pretentious and honest way to convey its great emotion and charm to the viewer. Working Dog excelled itself and surely must face great difficulty to surpass this masterpiece. Frontline and The Castle were very clever indeed, but The Dish is perceived by me as the best Australian Movie ever made, a priceless moment in Aussie Cine history.Charles Bud Tingwell's cameo appearance as the Priest is the icing on the cake. The amount of research to realize the Dish must have been extensive, to adhere for example to the 2.2825 GHz Apollo 11 frequency, the solid minus 90 dBM signals etc. in the script.It is worthwhile to note that NASA delayed the Parkes pictures by 6 seconds before its worldwide broadcast, in the event of an accident. Australian viewers saw mankind's giant leap 6.3 seconds earlier than the rest of the world !! (A 300 mS delay for the INTELSAT satellite link from Sydney,Australia to Houston,USA was incurred).I still watch The Dish regularly and the movie, if nothing, conveys greater emotion than it first did. Highly recommended  great acting across the entire cast, almost flawless camerawork, fantastic soundtrack, fast paced yet non-engaging script, witty comedy. A treat for the whole family. 9.5 out of 10 !!!

But frankly, I don't care, because The Dish as a movie is a splendid experience.Being heavily promoted as from the makers of 'The Castle'  may get a few extra punters in the door - particularly here in Australia where the exploits of the Working Dog team are rightly well known and loved; but those expecting The Castle 2 will be in for a surprise.But a pleasant one.  This film is much more ambitious, much larger in scope. As is to be expected, the writing here is very sharp - a likeable group of characters are defined very well very quickly, the simple plot flows smoothly, and there is a constant stream of funny (and some downright hilarious) moments.  Much of the humour is distinctly Aussie, and much of it arises from the culture clash between the locals and the visiting Americans. Yet despite this, the film does not stoop to the level of Ocker clich√© which plagues several other Australian films.  There is a core of simple humanity here which makes it very engaging.  It is for this reason also that I think the film will play very well in other countries.The cast is also very impressive, from the habitually sound Sam Neill, who projects an immense dignity, and Patrick Warburton as the pressured NASA official sent to oversee the operation, right down to the Mayor's son, reeling off technical details of the spacecraft to his bemused dad.  It is a credit to the cast, and to Rob Sitch as a director that I was rarely aware that I was watching a film, I was simply drawn into the experience.Those, like me, who wanted to be an Astronaut when they were little, and maintained an interest in the space program, will enjoy seeing the famous footage again in a new light.  Those looking for a comedy will find many laughs herein.  Those curious to understand the nature of being Australian will find some clues.  And those just looking for a film to make them feel good could do much much worse.  In short, The Dish is one of those rare movies which will appeal to pretty much everyone.  I can't really think of any serious criticisms, and left the cinema feeling... well, nice.  I have no doubt it will play well in Australia, but I also hope it does well overseas too, in the US and elsewhere.  I'd recommend it to everyone I know, and everyone else.When this one comes out on DVD I'll be getting a copy, and it'll be going straight to the pool room!

Like it's antipodean predecessor 'Priscilla...', 'The Dish' takes the best aspects of Australian culture and the Aussie persona and uses them to create the finest comedy of the year so far. Much of the humour is brutally honest, delivered in the kind of relaxed, conversational style which has become an Aussie trademark. Paired with a homegrown cast (headed by a wonderfully understated Sam Neill) and filmed on location at the satellite receiver station in South Australia, the film feels refreshingly natural and unconstructed.This sense of cultural identity gives 'The Dish' a surprising depth for such an uncomplicated film. Rather than resorting to the contrived, exaggerated Australian image of Paul Hogan, it revels in its roots without a hint of self-consciousness or compromise. Such an intense warmth towards its small-town location and everyman characters is shown that it is impossible not to share it, and from that grows a wonderful sense of intimacy. Despite the global importance of Apollo 11's mission, a real sense of the importance of it to the community and the individuals therein is present throughout. An American film may have made this subservient to the moon landings - here, the two are intertwined on an equal footing, and you care equally about each.And in that lies the secret of why 'The Dish' is such a damn good film. It's not the well-paced, extremely funny and well-delivered script, nor the quality of the acting, nor the great location or period soundtrack. It's because the film has a real sense of soul. It makes you want to care about it and it's characters. In mainstream film, that's a rare achievement indeed. Let's hope the Farrelly brothers are watching...8.5/10 "},{"Title":"What a Pleasant Surprise...","Date":"7 April 2003","Score":"30 out of 32 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, History","Review":" Once and a while a true surprise comes along. A film that is pleasantly surprising and enjoyable. Well, that's what The Dish is. It never takes itself too serious and never takes itself too lightly. It is just right.It is centered around the true story of the largest satellite dish in the world, found in the middle of a sheep paddock in Australia. The dish, at one time, broadcast the Apollo 11 moon landing to the world, and this is the story of the problems the men who ran the dish went through.Sam Neill and Patrick Warburton lead the group of four that manage the dish; the characters are all nice and pleasant and likable. No one is unlikable in this film.Sam Neill is a great actor; I've liked him in films since Dead Calm, but my real respect for his performances rose after he brought Dr. Allen Grant to life in Jurassic Park.Patrick Warburton, in my opinion, is one of the most underrated comedic actors in Hollywood. He always gets throwaway roles (MIIB, Big Trouble,=etc...), but in this film he gets a leading role (sorta) and handles it excellently. He proves he really can act--serious or comedic--in films.One thing that is so nice about The Dish is that it doesn't try to really prove anything extremely memorable. It's not trying to be the next big hit. It sticks to the facts while presenting some great actors and a twist of humor. And because of this, it is, possibly, one of the most pleasant film experiences I've had in recent years. Sometimes it's nice to sit back, relax and just watch a movie.

I guess you could say that it falls into that little genre of world cinema known as the regional comedy.  Such examples might include Cinema Paradiso or The Full Monty.  It looks, quite lovingly, at the lives of several characters and their environment, providing subtle humour and a healthy dose of sentiment as well.  What makes this film particularly interesting is its take on the first moon landing of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin in 1969.  While usually covered in an American jingoistic mode of filmmaking, The Dish offers a fresh, outside perspective.  How did the world view it?  How were Americans viewed?  The detached perspective of the Australians is the source of much humour within the film, culminating in a few scenes where the responsibility of providing a relay signal from Apollo 11 to Houston is placed fully upon the small band of dish operators in rural Australia.  Perhaps the most profound thing about this film is that it is largely based on a true story.With an all-round solid cast, led by Sam Neill and Tom Long.

This monumentally emotional moment for mankind, albeit thoroughly superfluous scientific achievement, is the background for this beautifully constructed film.The thing that makes this film so special is the fact that there isn't a character that appears on screen that you don't care about, regardless how small the role. That takes true writing and directing talent!The entire small town of Parks, New South Wales, Australia is all atwitter, because their radio observatory dish has been chosen to be NASA's official link to the Apollo 11 mission in the southern hemisphere. The mayor's wife comments, while serving her joint of lamb, that man being moments away from landing on the moon makes their problems seem mundane... That's the beauty of the film, you care so much about these people; their problems are anything but mundane - you cheer-on the techno-nerd asking the town beauty to go out with him; you ache inside because the head of the observatory lost his wife a year ago and she can't be there to revel in his glory; you love the fact that the out-of-place NASA official is the only one who realizes that all the mayor's rebellious teenage daughter really needs to chill-out is an ounce of respect.This is the best kind of feel-good film.

When Neil Armstrong walked on the moon, it brought everyone on the Earth together. This film gives an idea as to what it must have been like to see that experience.The film was a greatly pleasant movie and I was totally delighted to have a film as heartwarming and truly great as this. Sam Neill (JURASSIC PARK) and Patrick Warburton (SCREAM 3, BIG TROUBLE) who I feel are both very good actors take the leading roles of this delightful movie experience.

This dish was instrumental for communicating with the men of Apollo 11's mission to the moon. Neil Armstrong and his colleagues are about to land on the moon and suddenly the Australian tracking station loses contact with them. How could the people of the world react if they can't see the men taking steps on the lunar surface? It's something that the technicians in Australia will have to deal with to relay the images of man's first walk on the moon.The Dish, directed with folksy charm by Rob Sitch, shows how the people in Parkes, a remote spot, a simple dot in the map, rally for the biggest event in their lives. They are proud of being at the center of such a historical moment. At the same time we are taken behind the scenes to see what is really going on. Cliff Buxton, and his team are dealt a blow when they lose the signal to Apollo 11. Instead of panicking, Buxton decides not to tell Houston about the problem they are experiencing.Luckily, everything turns out all right.Sam Neill, makes an impression as Cliff Buxton.

Not the general facts-for Parkes certainly did feature greatly in the transmission of pictures from space in the first moon landing.  As one who was around at the time - and yes - we did sit glued to our TV sets - I remember very well just how much the experience took over our lives.Whether or not the actual story is true, the movie is greatly entertaining, the characters are believable and it gives to today's cynical viewers and idea of just how completely overawed and interested the world was in what was going on in outer space.

I have watched it many times since and never tire of it. My reaction is why don't we get more films from Australia here? The humor that comes across during this tense time is what holds this film together. The acting is first rate from Sam Neil all the way down the line. The town of Parkes is proud to be part of the moon landing, but all in all takes it in stride.Tayler Kane as Rudy was a delight. When he thought that Neil Armstrong was actually on his walkie-talkie, I really laughed. The scene was priceless. Likewise Tom Long as Glenn, the computer expert played his role to perfection. When he jumps to take off his glasses whenever Janine comes into the facility is too much for words. The final bit of hilarity came when Mayor Bob asks everyone at the dance to remain upstanding for the American anthem, and the band breaks into the theme for Hawaii Five-O. The looks on the faces of the American ambassador and Patrick Warbourton are priceless. It doesn't get any better than that.Yet, the seriousness of the mission still comes across and the pride felt by the crew of the dish is readily visible. When it looks like the wind storm might take them out of the mission, you really feel for Cliff Buxton and his guys. You know he's going to go for it because he earlier said that This is science's chance to be daring. This is one movie I will never get tired of viewing. It is funny, it is serious, it is poignant, all without being mawkish or overly sentimental. Having lived through the entire U.S. space program (I was 21 when Apollo 11 landed), I know the excitement shown by the characters in the film as Apollo 11 first lifted off, and then when Armstrong came off the LEM and stepped onto the lunar surface. It was an exciting time and the final point of the movie that I enjoyed, was that this event affected many people outside the U.S. This is something that is often overlooked and it was great to see how the people of Parkes and in particular, the crew of the dish, helped bring the pictures from the moon to the rest of the world.

So many men and women had dedicated their very lives to this one moment in time that it stopped the world (not just one nation) and allowed all of us the chance to see just how far human beings could go in their quest to reach that next horizon. And although THE DISH is about one backward country radio telescope in Parkes, Australia that beamed those first Armstrong-on-the-moon images to billions of people ...it is much more than that.Cliff Buxton (Sam Neill, JURASSIC PARK) is the director of the Parkes telescope, a sensitive piece of hardware surrounded by sheep paddocks. Seeing such a large array (this telescope could actually deliver telemetry, track the lunar module, AND send back television images) in an austere landscape made me pause several times during the film and marvel at the sheer beauty of this monstrosity against the setting of Australia's back country.Initially the film takes on the feel of something homey; a gentle side-trip down a path we all know too well (the first manned mission to the moon.) These hick-like folk are in charge of something as important as the lunar landing?! But the viewer gets pulled into the film in a very intimate way. We see that these ARE simple people, but ones who take their jobs very seriously ...but not overly so. The comedy, like the movie itself, is light and sprinkled throughout the relationships (even when the lose Apollo 11 as they approach the moon and lie to NASA about it!) I found myself getting choked-up as the world &#151; and this little microcosm of people in Parkes &#151; held their breath as those first pictures of man's footprint on the moon took place (during hurricane force winds that threatened to blow over the telescope and kill the men inside operating it; they realized the importance of that moment and were willing to risk everything.)

Outside of a few mild curse words mumbled in anger at machines, this film proves Hollywood has it's head up it's 'machine' when it produces films accessible only to those that are sick, perverted or emotionally retarded.  And it's not only Hollywood.  More and more it seems many filmmakers are forcing their lifestyles upon their viewers.  Example 'Casablanca' has a very wide audience appeal, while 'Pulp Fiction' can only be enjoyed by those able to stomach the vilest of themes.  Case in point, I watched this film right after watching 'Billy Elliot'.  Though the acting in both films was superb, this film was everything 'Billy' needed to be, but was not.  It was subtle, humorous, dramatic and thoughtful.  While 'Billy Elliot' relied on strong language to communicate it's maturity, 'The Dish' relies on the strength of it's characters and story.  While 'Billy' hammers you over the head with it's I'm not gay... not that there's anything wrong with being gay!  message, 'Dish' allows it's audience to discover the message, (the one found in most great films... 'Every man's life makes a difference').  'Billy' had an annoying Speilbergesque obviousness to it, while 'Dish' flows timelessly, like listening to a funny friend tell a great story.  One of the things I like most about this film is the way it deals with those that are troublesome.  Rather than have an over the top bad guy (the clich√© stuffy conservative) this film just allows the dumb characters to speak their mind and hang themselves, which is far more fun to watch. The highest of praise to Aussie Rob Sitch who directed and co-wrote.  Also, very beautiful and fun cinematography from Graeme Wood.  Great cast all around including a very funny Patrick Warburton.  Wake up Hollywood, this is what you could be making!

Indeed, based on the numerous responses I have received to my negative review of `The Castle,' I would be inclined to employ the term `fanatical' in describing their passion.  I discovered from first hand experience just how vehemently they will defend their product &#150; and woe to anyone who dares voice a minority opinion.  For of all the 200 plus reviews I have posted on imdb.com and amazon.com, none has come even close to eliciting the kind of fiery responses generated by this one &#150; pointing to an intense cultural divide I had no idea existed.  Judging from the vitriol contained in the reactions, you would have thought that I had had the temerity to badmouth the Sistine Chapel or the Great Pyramids at Giza, at the very least.  Even today, almost two years after writing the review, I still get outraged emails taking umbrage with my assessment of a film that I have come to realize is nothing less than a cultural cinematic icon to a large number of the folks from the Land Down Under.  Some of the emails have even been quite clever and witty in their, shall we say `colorful,' way of setting me straight &#150; my favorite accusing me of being `brain dead' and unable to understand the English language when spoken with an Aussie accent!  (I sure understood the emails, though).  All this to defend a movie that, even by the standards of those who love it, can certainly not rate as much more than a pleasant, diversionary trifle.  One should know better where to stake one's battles.Thus, when it came to reviewing the latest feature by the makers of `The Castle' (`The Dish'), I began to wonder if maybe it wouldn't just be better if I skipped the effort entirely.  I felt as if I'd done enough to harm Aussie-American relations already &#150; and I really had no desire to further alienate an entire continent inhabited by what I am sure are damn nice people under other, less inflammatory circumstances.  But when you're driven to seek the truth, you're driven.  I had to find out if I was I as far off on my assessment of the earlier film as the Aussies seemed to think I was or if there really were no middle ground between what I found funny and what they did.  Ultimately, my perverse need to stir up the pot got the better of me so I finally broke down and rented `The Dish,' a true story about the small group of men working at a satellite dish in a remote section of Australia who, in July 1969, played a major part in helping to transmit the first live images of a man walking on the moon.I'm happy to report that `The Dish' turns out to be a world-class charmer, a delightful film that captures the high-spirited innocence and optimism of the space race era and vividly recreates a time when people from all over the world could do little but stare in spellbound amazement at the achievements of which mankind proved itself capable &#150; and feel the mutual pride and camaraderie that such events occasioned.  The makers of `The Dish' dramatize this feeling of universal connectedness by showing how even the most remote, seemingly `insignificant' people could be made to feel a part of an event happening half a world away and commanding the attention of most of the planet's inhabitants.  Here near the small town of Parkes, Australia, nestled in what is little more than a sheep pasture, looms the 1,000-ton satellite dish that will serve as the eye of the world for this event of monumental historic importance.  The makers of the film have chosen to take a charming, low-key approach to the material, focusing on the likable, decidedly offbeat people who make up both the team at the dish as well as the citizenry of the nearby town.  With the subtle quirkiness common to most Australian comedies, `The Dish' displays a real affection for its characters, showing them as flawed human beings who, nevertheless, learn to accept and cope with the differences that might otherwise separate them.  Thus, even the simmering conflict between the American hotshot from NASA assigned to the dish and one of the more sensitive Aussie specialists plays itself out in a believable and touching way.  Other characters defy the stereotypes that less gifted filmmakers might have enforced upon them.  The mayor of the town, for instance, rather than being a self-congratulatory blowhard (as we fear he will become in the early parts of the film) turns out to be a sweet, gentle, family-loving man who is as overwhelmed by the world's spotlight being shone on his community as are the common folk who make up his constituents.   Lending his star quality to the proceedings, Sam Neil gives a beautifully understated performance as Cliff Buxton, a recently widowed technician at the dish who manages to take all this hubbub in stride but who conveys, in gentle ways, the sheer awesomeness of the event in which he finds himself taking part.  In fact, it is this sense of ordinary people suddenly finding themselves a part of history that makes `The Dish' more than simply a clever, likable comedy.  We find ourselves genuinely touched and moved by much of what we see on screen.  Perhaps, after the tragedy of the World Trade Center attacks - during which people all over the world sat riveted in morbid fascination to their television sets watching that horrifying event unfold - the film attains an added poignancy.  It reminds us a bit of our lost innocence as we see the people in this film staring spellbound at their television sets 32 years earlier for a far different purpose &#150; to witness, as a united, worldwide community, the GOOD things mankind can do when he puts his mind to it rather than the evil.  By dealing so warmly and gently with the people who make up this little corner of the world, `The Dish' lifts the spirits and renews the faith.  So, just to make the record clear, I'm definitely WITH my Aussie friends on this one!  Time now to bury the hatchet?

That time was not so long ago either. Many of us remember it fondly from our youth. In fact, it's epicenter may well have been the Summer of '69 when we witnessed the greatest technological feat mankind has ever accomplished. Even though there was a controversial war going on, it seemed all humankind came together and rooted for three United States astronauts who were hundreds of thousands of miles away attempting history's first lunar landing! I can not overstate this, in my life I've never seen the world community so together on any other issue or thing. This was simply a galvanizing moment for all humanity.The Dish captures this time wonderfully. From the start, when we are introduced to a senior version of Sam Neil's character set against the Parkes beautiful countryside, this movie gives you that warm-fuzzy feeling. The story is excellent, even better because all the main ingredients were true. Though the story doesn't possess the life-or-death urgency of Apollo 13, it does tell an important story I, myself, was not aware of...And, it's even got a little tension.Details in the movie, for me at any rate, added to the joy of watching it. For instance...The great soundtrack had a gem that is just under the radar for the period, that being Something In The Air by Thunderclap Newman. Great song and tailor made for the topic! The cinematography was so Technicolor-Like and immediate I wanted to walk into almost every scene. The time, the story and the characters were so hand-in-glove perfectly portrayed in this movie, I just know if I could walk into this wonderful Australian township, with it's equally wonderful citizens, I would love it. Could it be this great in reality, probably not, but it's a movie about a time past and it's a complete success as far as that goes. If you enjoy a good life-affirming story don't miss The Dish.

The interplay of the small and the large scales in human endeavors is illustrated in various ways, while emphasizing the necessity for cooperation and respect between often widely disparate players. The small group running the radio antenna in Parkes Australia is contrasted with the huge operation of NASA that ran the overall mission. The contrast is also found in the small town of Parkes and the people who live there who become a focus of attention for a few days during the mission. Much of the humor derives from the small scale foibles of the personalities in Parkes, while we also are shown how very ordinary people can often contribute small but critical efforts in large human enterprises or historic events. The other main theme is one of daring, and perseverance in the face of various odds, from the disdain of the mayor's daughter for her would-be wooer, to unexpected weather, to the dangers of flying the mission to the moon and back. We are shown how we can all be both silly and effective all at the same time, how courage on small or large scales is still courage, and how occasionally risks are a necessary part of life.

He isn't recognized by the technician that walks around on the site, but he worked together with a small group of Australian technicians and one man from NASA and made it possible for the world to see the very first human steps on the moon. As he goes back in time with his memories, we see how a satellite dish, once placed in the middle of a sheep farm near a small town, caused a lot of stress, but also town pride...What I like so much about this movie is that it uses a more comical look towards one of the greatest events in history and the differences in cultural attitudes between Australia and the U.S. This could have been a very dignified and formal movie, but instead they chose to make a comedy out of it.

It's the real story of how a lowly radio telescope in Parkes, in the southern state of New South Wales in Australia, was upgraded in 1969 to transmit live pictures of the Apollo 11 moon landing for NASA. At the precise time the landing was scheduled to take place, the direct line of sight was going to be with the Southern Hemisphere, not the North, halfway around the planet from Cape Kennedy. The country town of Parkes, not far from Sydney, still has the largest radio telescope in the Southern Hemisphere, 210 feet in diameter, but it's located in the middle of a sheep paddock to this very day. At the time, it was the most powerful receiving dish in the world.Working Dog Productions (comprised of Australian national icon raconteurs Santo Cilauro, Tom Gleisner, Jane Kennedy and Rob Sitch), despite their background in comedy, have captured the times with authentic 1960s music, opening with Russell Morris's The Real Thing, followed by Herb Alpert's Spanish Flea. The irreverent skewering of Australian smalltown pretentions could not have been successful without the playful soundtrack providing that sense of hope and excitement. Authentic NASA and JFK archival footage also allows The Dish (2000) to join some larger budget Apollo program movies on its own terms.The funniest scene is with the teenage band in the small town, who are experimenting with Jimmy Hendrix but have to answer to Mrs Pearce (Denise Roberts), who won't let them play too loud, and insists that the band learns to play the American anthem in 48 hrs, because the US Ambassador is going to attend the town for the lunar landing. What the band comes up with is totally priceless, and I'm with them. So is the Ambassador ! I only wish we could have heard more of it ...The five quirky Parkes dish operators are brought to life by the very funny Kevin Harrington as Ross 'Mitch' Mitchell, who maneuvers the dish, Tom Long as painfully shy Glenn Latham, the computer scientist, Patrick Warburton as prim but charismatic NASA representative Al Barnett, Sam Neill as Cliff Buxton, Parkes director and dishmaster, and finally, Tayler Kane as the lanky security guard Rudi who is so overly impressed by his increased security status. In the second most funniest scene a local yokel newspaper journo tries to interview them, and he observes that the Americans spent 10 years, billions of dollars to let us watch man walk on the moon, and in the end it falls to you blokes. How do you feel about that? Mitch (Kevin Harrington), ever chafing, retorts, -A lot better before you opened your trap.Everyone gets into the spirit of allowing Parkes to shine during its moment of glory, and the audience is dragged right along. When something goes wrong, Al, the prim and proper NASA rep, is also dragged in. ... What have I done? he muses as he buys the facility some time. -You bulls****ed NASA, comes the Aussie reply. The whole cast is a joy to watch, although the women tend to be just caricatures. Sam Neill has never been more tender as the recently widowed radio astronomer missing more than grieving his wife, who would have loved all this. Nothing is as frightening as regret, he quotes her in a quiet moment. Patrick Warburton, the same actor who voices Kronk in The Emperor's New Groove (2001), also has some soft-spoken tender moments as he begins to confide in his host and as he charms the rabidly antagonistic Marie (Lenka Kripac) with a single handshake. Comedian Kevin Harrington (Mitch) steals every scene, of course, and Carl Snell echoes our own humility as the space fan and Mayor's tiny son, Billy, who is probably the person really behind Parkes' nomination into the Apollo program.The most wonderful, quintessentially 1960s moment is when the chafing Aussie finally admits, to the man he'd been chafing against, that it was his own fault that the generator failed. The NASA rep, despite their long-standing feud, just says Well, these things happen. Better get to work. The moment makes you deeply regret that all it took for man to go to the moon was that kind of spirit and commitment. For the people involved, it wasn't about the cold war, it wasn't about which damn fool government got to plant its flag on another space body. It was the cooperation of people who had to relearn how to even speak to one another. It is the eternal shame of the human race that we could foresee a routinely functioning space station in orbit by 2001 but we couldn't pull it off for real, because of politics. At some point you realize that the funding concerns were always a red herring, because even the poorest families have to figure out how to both educate their kids and feed them. This was science's chance to be daring, a planetary opportunity the human race willingly lost 6 missions later. I wonder how those who killed the Apollo program feel now.It is to the creators', Working Dog Productions' credit that we get such a lump in our throat over the fact that this real CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation) facility is still a part of NASA missions to this day. It is a matter of public record that despite gusts of wind greater than what the Parkes telescope was rated for, the Aussies (pronounced Auzziez for everyone who continually GETS IT WRONG) provided the live TV coverage of The Eagle landing.

And that's one of many reasons why The Dish is such a wonderful little film.  It reclaims NASA's space program for those of us who were too distracted to pay attention.  And it does so, not by placing it within the social and political convulsions of the time, which would be to assign it marginal importance, but by unfolding the drama of the Apollo mission from the setting of an idyllic little sheep paddock in provincial Australia, where the world's largest and most powerful radio telescope was charged with the task of receiving and broadcasting the event walk to the entire world.  This film is incredibly charming and innocent, with a keen sense of humor about otherwise obscure people suddenly thrust into the spotlight of world attention.  There's a particular scene that is emblematic The Dish's simplicity, charm, and wit.  Colorfully lit beneath a black Australian night, the enormous dish looks like a new form of life, its frame and skin and delicate but precise movements floating as gently as a butterfly, its circular, concave shape suggesting living organs of sight and sound.  As the eyes and ears of the world, it actually had a brief but mystical life of its own.  It's a singular skill to take such simple images, and make them sharply evocative.  You'll love this movie.

The miracle of space exploration is all so routine to them, it's hard to explain what the big deal was all about.This movie perfectly captures the excitement of the first manned moon landing, and does it from a point-of-view that most people never think about. It's funny we see the images on our TV, and most of the time we never even think about how they got there. It's just TV, right? It comes out of a box (or, nowadays, a flat screen), right? It just comes through wires or through the air.This movie is about one of the massive antenna assemblies that received the images from the Apollo XI mooncast, and about the people who made it work. And while that sounds more like something that you'd expect to see on a how it's made show on the Science Channel than in a movie, it's actually a wonderfully entertaining and funny movie about people who are engaging and funny, and who are doing a critical and fascinating job that made it possible for millions of people worldwide to watch, live, one of humanity's great milestone events. And another nice thing about it this is a FAMILY movie. There is no nudity, no violence, and although the movie has a PG-13 rating, I can't remember any language in it that was overtly offensive.Sam Neill stars in this movie as Cliff Buxton, the guy who is in charge of the huge antenna dish that gives the movie its title. Neill is excellent in this. He does a superb job in bringing out the nuances of the character and in working with the other people in this movie. My only problem with him is that in the sequence that frames the movie, when he has to appear aged, a truly AWFUL job of makeup was done. It looked like something that might be done in an elementary school play by kids who borrowed their mom's makeup kit. Please, please try to ignore this cringe-inducing look, because it's very brief and Neill looks fine the rest of the movie.The rest of the cast is also very good, although I don't think any of them are well-known or very familiar. They do well with the material, and there's a real sense of a group of people who like each other and care about each other, while at the same time occasionally getting on each other's nerves. They're mostly engineering/scientist types, which basically means they're aware that they're better with machines and numbers than they are with people. There's a little sub-plot involving romance that's very funny and sweet.The tension in the movie comes from the fact that the giant antenna assembly that receives the lunar transmissions had to be pointed very precisely in order to get the reception, and that certain kinds of weather conditions made moving the giant antenna very dangerous. While most of the world was sitting in front of their TV sets, expectantly waiting for the mooncast to begin, there were a whole bunch of people in Australia, where the antenna was located, frantically working and making some very tough decisions to make it possible.I have to say that the sequence when everyone is finally watching Neil Armstrong take his first steps on the moon really swept me back to when I was 12 years old and sitting spellbound on the couch in our living room, watching that shadowy shape on the TV screen make that giant leap for mankind. I'd like to hope that maybe, through watching this movie, younger people who missed out on that magical moment will at least understand how transforming it was for the entire world. We don't have many moments like that in history. I'm glad I was there for this one. And this movie captures that moment, when just for a few heartbeats while we watched the blurry black-and-white image of a man in a spacesuit slowly coming down a ladder, literally everyone in the world was riveted and united by a sense of perfect awe.And I'm glad this movie captures some of the magic of that particular event, and gives us some insight into what it took to bring it to the world on TV. That it almost didn't make it live onto TV was something I didn't fully appreciate until I saw The Dish. This is a great movie to enjoy with your family. I don't like to say family movie, because that conjures up something silly and trivial and kid-centric, which this movie is not. I really enjoyed it and I think anyone who is into the space program or who can identify with engineers and scientists will like it too.

I was 12 when Apollo 11 landed, and 40 years later it's still one of the most inspiring events of my life. Apollo helped interest me in a career in electrical engineering, computers and communications. I've designed receivers for data that has crossed a hundred million miles of empty space. Even though I know how it works, there's still an element of magic and wonder in it for me.So a movie like this couldn't be more up my alley. It's a wonderful depiction of a few of the many thousands of unsung but crucial Apollo support people -- and the attention to detail is amazing. They even got the Apollo down link frequency (2282.5 MHz) and signal levels right, and when Sam Neill calls offset feed! at the beginning of the moonwalk I almost fell out of my seat.Some inaccuracies are of course unavoidable, but only one actually bothers me the detour into an alternate reality for the sake of some admittedly very funny comedy when a power failure scrambles the tracking computer. I laughed as hard as anyone during the American ambassador's site visit. But not only didn't this happen, it wouldn't have. People make mistakes and equipment fails. That's expected in any space mission. But lying about it as these guys did would be highly unprofessional. It's something you just don't do.Those who know this subject better than anyone have written about the other nits in this movie, and you can read about them herehttp//members.pcug.org.au/~mdinn/TheDish/But aside from all that, this is a thoroughly enjoyable movie.

It's also possible that the movie in question just might be worth watching because it is well-made, deals with a genuinely inspiring topic and features some classy actors. For me, The Dish falls in that category. The dish is a 1,000-ton radio telescope plunked down in a sheep pasture close to the New South Wales town of Parkes. It's purpose, as part of a NASA network, is to help track Apollo 11's voyage to the moon and to relay television pictures of Neil Armstrong becoming the first man to set foot there. Sam Neill as Cliff Buxton heads the team running the radio telescope. There's also Al Burnett (Patrick Warburton) as a NASA representative, Glenn Latham (Tom Lang) as a young and excruciatingly shy mathematician and computer whiz, and Mitch Mitchell (Kevin Harrington), who's job it is to see that all the mechanical functions work without a hitch. We know Armstrong made it and we know television showed us his first steps. For those of us who were around, we also remember how amazing it all was. What we learn in this gentle comedy are the crises that happened. One morning, for instance, Cliff says, Glenn, come here. What? Al Burnett looks at Glenn. Every coordinate in this book has been changed, he says. Yeah... I changed them, Glenn says. Why? Because they were wrong. Why were they wrong, Al asks. Dunno, Glenn says. Latham steps in. What about them were wrong, he asks Glenn. Oh! Well, Glenn says, the figures NASA gave us were for the northern hemisphere... and we're in the southern hemisphere? I can change them back but then you'd be pointing in the wrong dir... Glenn, it might be a good idea for you to tell us these things, Cliff says. Oh, sure, I just didn't want to worry you... Cuppa tea, Al? There's the pride and enthusiasm that overtakes everyone living in Parkes, the visit from the U.S. ambassador and the Australian prime Minister that sends everyone into a tizzy, the near disaster that occurs when contact is lost with Apollo 11 and how an amusing appearance of imperturbability is maintained in public when everything from failed back-up generators, wiped-out computers and a gale promises one of the biggest let-downs -- no television broadcast -- for the entire world. For me, one of the reasons this movie works so well is because Parkes is an idealized small town where everyone knows each other, there are absolutely no secrets, and where the people have personalities which are calculated to be amusing but which aren't manipulated into becoming caricatures. Bob McIntyre (Roy Billing), the mayor of Parkes, is a fireplug of a guy who resembles Bob Hoskins. The technical aspects of what's happening may go over his head, but he's willing to give the benefit of the doubt to almost anyone. His relationship with his wife, May (Genevieve Mooy), is friendly, loving and pleasant to observe. We learn a little, and occasionally a lot, about the people of Parkes and we wind up liking them. This is comedy, but it's gentle stuff. When we smile at a person's puzzlement, dialogue or reaction it's because we appreciate the situation, not that we're enjoying our own superiority. Sam Neill, smoking a pipe and wearing a sweater, provides the steady center of the movie. He does a fine job. The Dish is more or less based on a true story and we're told at the end that the radio telescope is still part of the NASA tracking network.

If you were on a long, overseas flight and you saw it as an option among the movies you could watch, would you bother plugging in its number? Or would it find a place among your DVD collection? The Dish is a great little Australian comedy gem that garners a yes to all those questions. Written by the crack writing team behind The Castle and TV's Frontline, it focuses on the previously unheralded role the small Australian town of Parkes had in the 1969 moon landings. Parkes is home to The Dish - the largest radio telescope in the southern hemisphere. When Neil Armstrong and the boys were ready to walk on the moon for the first time, Parkes was an essential cog in getting those pictures back to Earth.That's the facts on which this comedy is based, and around those facts a lovely plot is woven that includes some memorably characters and performances. Sam Neill is great, as always, and Kevin Harrington is also perfectly cast. My favourite, though, is Roy Billing as the Mayor of Parkes. The man's timing is a lesson to all comedy actors.

It may have been one small step for man, but for a handful of Aussie scientists, it was a giant leap. One that almost didn't happen........Well I can only give praise to the dish. The team that bought it to us works under the banner of 'Working Dog'. This team includes Rob Sitch, Jane Kennedy, Santo Cilauro and Tom Gleisner. They did a fantastic job in writing the script and bringing the movie to the bigscreen. Also the musical score in the Dish was fantastic, with credit going to music composer Edmond Choi, of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. He also wrote the music score for the Aussie movie 'The Castle'. This must have been a demanding topic to research and remember, but I feel that we got a reasonably accurate story. I like the start and the end of the film and how we were seeing it through old eyes, plus how this story has many other elements within in it. The tension and the humour was added in a clever way which I will never forget. This team also bought to Australian Television one of the funniest shows in years, the current affairs spoof, Frontline, which I loved very much.The cast of this so big and talented it would take me all day to list out for you. There are basically 4 main characters. Firstly we have Sam Neill, who starred as Cliff Buxton, the leader of the extraordinary job to bring the footage of man first walking on the moon. His character was very likable, tense and humble. I especially love some of the lines he has to say. Lines such as This is science's chance to be daring and  Failure is not quite as frightening as regret  were brilliant. Neill has appeared in some great movies, including Jurassic Park, the horse whisper, dead calm and the gripping true story of Lindy chamberlain's, titled  A cry in the dark, which I can remember being an unbelievable film. The other Aussie main characters will be not be as well known, Kevin Harrington and Tom Long. Their characters were funny to watch and were very much Australian in their conversation and attitudes. I love how nerdy Tom's character, Glenn Latham, is and how down to earth Ross 'Mitch' Mitchell (Kevin Harrington's character) is. I love his line That's bullshit. You just bullshitted NASA!, just hilarious. The American role in the Dish was done very well by former Seinfeld star Patrick Warburton. His character Al Burnett was graceful and tolerant, especially in a crisis. The one face I do remember from the cast is the gorgeous Eliza Szonert as Janine Kellerman. She played Danni Stark in the Aussie soap 'Neighbours'. Look I could go on and on about the cast though, people like Roy Billing, Taylor Kane, Charles 'Bud' Tingwell, Genevieve Mooy, Denise Roberts and a cameo role by one Australia's favourite ladies, Colette Mann!The story of the Dish is one of great heart and history. Whether the story is completely true no one will know because it is only BASED on a true story, but who cares. This is a great look at what an historical event this was and how important Parkes was in bringing this event to everyone around the world. I remember when this movie came out in the cinema. It caused quite a commotion and rightly so. It was made by a talented group of people and if you haven't seen their other film 'The Castle', then you have missed out. I can only recommend the Dish and when you get the chance to watch it, seize it by all means. This movie will be added to my growing DVD collection very soon!Rating 5 Stars or 10/10.

It could easily have gone down as a smeary image on a black and white T.V. screen showing to millions of frustrated viewers worldwide. It is this tension, the wide disparity between the awkward (star-cross-eyed) scientistic efforts of the aussies (led by a superbly underplayed Sam Neil) in an outback sheep ranch, that creates the huge sense of catharsis and relief at the end of the day. That first step might not have been redorded so dramatically, if it not have been for the heroic risk-taking of the zany (yet utterly sincere) Australian team. Sort of reminds one of the early American spirit, the pioneers who settled the west. Even the token American, pitched in at the finish to lend his support to even the worst of the bumblers. What do you do when your science falls apart? Point at the stars (moon in this case) and pray. Why not most scientific breakthroughs were accidents anyway?

Film tells the story of how Parkes Observatoy, New South Wales, Australia, was used to relay the live pictures of man's first ever steps on the moon during the historic year of 1969. Not bad for a satellite receiver built in the middle of a sheep paddock!The Australians do it from time to time, knock out a cracking picture that turns heads in the right direction. With an appealing cast headed by a superb Sam Neill, director Rob Sitch (The Castle) offers up a side of the historical Apollo 11 moon landing that many would have forgotten; namely that someone had to be responsible for showing those live feeds as man took his giant leap for mankind. Here we become party to a small group of normal people working their hinds off to make sure millions don't miss the occasion.In the lead up to the landings the town of Parkes is absolutely bursting with excitement, thus the pressure on the guys at the observatory is from both NASA and Australia! It wont be all plain sailing, and for sure there's some artistic licence used for tension purposes, but the drama is effective whilst beautifully being cloaked in Australian dry humour. The technical parts of the narrative are kept to understandable levels, aided in impact by being delivered by such affable and humane boffin types. While the character development is first rate, rendering the comedy that is born out as being natural. Slight, simple, low-key, a film where not much happens and tagged as a heart-warming human interest tale, The Dish is all of those things.

What makes the film so wonderful is the cast and the way they interact during both good times and when in crisis. Led by the wonderful New Zealander Sam Neill and supported by a great cast of Australian actors and American Patrick Warburton as NASA's representative in Parkes, the chemistry is just right. Enough warm, personal touches are included so that we feel as if we are there with them and I found myself rooting for Parkes and the crew of this large radio telescope located in a rural sheep paddock in the small town of Parkes, just outside of Sydney. Spoiler alert I am an American scientist and astronomy buff who remembers vividly watching the moonwalk with awe while I was still in undergraduate studies at Penn State University, but until I saw this movie I never knew that the first moonwalk photos were indeed sent from Parkes and not from Goldstone, California. Not only that, I had no idea that the Australian crew together with their one NASA representative had to overcome gusts of gale force wind which were over 65 MPH during the moonwalk and which nearly cost the world the great privilege of seeing Armstrong and Aldrin first set their feet on the lunar surface because the dish was shaking so badly. I was very, very impressed with the professionalism and enthusiasm of the Parkes team for their role in this worldwide team effort and in their refusal to give up and take the safe way out and not move the dish in the wicked wind. This movie also has wonderful moments of small town pride that hits this Australian town as their roll in the Apollo 11 mission grows larger and larger, and in the coming together of the town, the various dignitaries and especially with the dish crew during a disastrous power failure that they decided to hide from NASA, even though the NASA representative tells them that it is OK to tell Houston about it. Their pride is at stake, and they are determined to solved the problem themselves, and the crew really gels as the American representative takes their side and helps them in all sorts of ways, some very humorous, to reacquire the signal from Apollo 11 which was lost when the power failure knocked out their computers. One of the funniest deals with faking their way through a visit to the dish from the US Ambassador, who wants to hear Armstrong talking with Houston. How they solve that little problem and still keep their situation a secret is a wonderful and lovely moment about international teamwork. This is a wonderful Australian film that Americans will also enjoy as we all root for the 4 men inside the Parkes Radio Telescope as they televise one of the greatest achievements of the 20th century to over 600 million human beings all over the world while still retaining a small-town feeling. I highly recommend this movie to all who enjoy NASA true stories, to those who love Australian film, to all fans of Sam Neill and the other wonderful cast members in this film, and to anyone who would like to see a family film with a happy ending that will make you cheer and cry with joy. Kudos to everyone involved!

Cliff Buxton (Neill) provides fatherly direction to his crew consisting of grumpy technician Mitch (Harrington), disarming math geek Glenn (Long), Clark Kent-like NASA liaison Al Burnett (Warburton), and somewhat inept security guard Rudi (Taylor Kane).  The small town is abuzz at the distinction of being a part of making history and beguiled by a bit of international attention.  Mayor Bob McIntyre (Roy Billin) is in the middle of all the fuss, juggling visits from both the snooty Prime Minister (Billie Brown) and space-buff American Ambassador (John McMartin), as well as the townspeople's gossip and the moods of his sullen teenage daughter Marie (Lenka Kripac).  It isn't long before one or two things go wrong out at the dish and the small crew are in a conspiratory huddle sweating bullets while assuring the NASA brass that everything is well under control.  But even at the most tense moments we are not too far off from a good laugh, as when the Ambassador stops in for a visit just after crew has lost their signal, crashed their computer, and are at their wit's end.  Mitch and Cliff's solution is quite comic (if a little unlikely), and demonstrates the kind of wild resourcefulness that springs from desperation.  Indeed it is in these minor catastrophes the film is at its most brilliant, putting the microscope to a handful of people experiencing the uncertainty, fear, and drama that accompanies decision making behind the 8-ball.The film makes a few jibes at the characters' expense, but if you're expecting a lot of Aussie bumpkin gags (ala Crocodile Dundee and Quigley Down Under) you'll be disappointed. As quirky as some of the players can be, they are all merely human, and it is only their accents that distinguish them from the rest of us.  The character interactions, coupled with the plot line of tracking Armstrong and broadcasting the mission, are charming if a bit clich√©.  Will the shy, bumbling Glenn ask out his beautiful female admirer Janine?  Will Mitch finally accept Al as a good guy, rather than the arrogant American cowboy he appears to be?  We know the answers already, but it's fun to watch the interplay.  Even with a few cheap feel-good moments and banalities uttered now and then, the attraction of the story will win you over.  A warm and engaging comedy, The Dish is the perfect entr√©e for those growing a little weary of America's recent surge of toilet-humor thigh-slappers.

Naturally, this particular nest had a particular interest in the events, possessing the largest satellite dish in the world that was capable of transmitting the events on TV across the globe.  Yet, the viewer is drawn into the excitement of the time that must have been felt by just about everyone.The ordinary characters, the music, the clothes, the feeling that humankind was on the brink of something big, new and life-changing all draw you into the action and make those of us unfortunate enough not to have been there at the time share some of the excitement of the ordinary folk.Brilliant and funny, especially at the points where the film underlines just how removed Australia is to the US, both in tems of distance and of habits. Probably the funniest moment is where a young Australian band play the US national anthem to impress the visiting US NASA engineer and,not knowing any better, play the theme tune to Hawaii Five 0 instead!

It's the kind of movie that people really want to see, but which rarely comes along.The Movie industry makes much of their market research, and they claim that they tailor movies to the polled wants of the public. If this is so, why is it that there is such junk released every year? Nobody actually wants to make a bad movie, but bad movies abound. One has to ask, how did the makers of The Dish get it so right? They're a group of Australian television personalities who have been involved in a string of popular but low-key shows over the years. How did they come up with such an unforgettable, marvellous, splendid gem of a movie?It's a typical Australian failing to give scant credit to our own, but I think the Working Dog team have probably put an end to that syndrome for good.As for IMDB reviewers like Smoothbean and Blues Doctor, I can only say it's a pity that their taste is apparently so coarsened by junk movies, that they can no longer enjoy quality movies.

By that measurement, I would give The Dish a very big 10 out of 10, and say that it is probably the best movie I've seen so far this year.Now, I know by saying this that other reviewers will be encouraged to give this movie a thumbs down because of all the good reports they have heard about it, or all the great reviews thy have read. But that's the danger with a film like The Dish the earlier you actually go and see it, the more immune you will be from all the hype of word of mouth and box office success that goes with leaving off seeing it too late.All I can say is that this is a movie which achieves the onerous task of taking potentially stale subject matter and transforming it into something wonderful. The filmmakers (who also made The Castle, which I shall be watching tonight) have taken the slim notion of small-town Australia's involvement in the Apollo 11 Moon mission and, by offering numerous quirky, interesting and affable characters and incidents to flesh out their story, have created one of those movies which makes you feel good about yourself, other people, and mankind in general. Belly laughs follow on from real, humane drama, while little details beautifully observed spotlight the bigger picture of one of the human race's greatest achievements of the 20th Century.I don't want to give anything away because The Dish is full of gems which it would be cruel to tell anybody who has not seen the film for themselves about.

While we are constantly reminded how our parents kept busy burning their bras, screaming at The Beatles and establishing the notion of free love, our collective cultural contribution as yet is Blur v Oasis, the birth of digital television, and the ironic recreation of Seventies fashion. We also managed to miss the most remarkable achievement in the history of our planet - man landing on the moon &#150; and 'The Dish' is here to rub our noses in it.The movie follows the little-known story of the team led by Cliff Buxton (Sam Neill) who ran the enormous radio telescope responsible for receiving those famous images of Armstrong and co as they completed their lunar landing. Somewhat unbelievably, the dish of the title was not located, as one might expect, in Houston, or Florida, but in the middle of a sheep paddock in New South Wales, Australia.The film does well at playing up the obvious humour of a small town in spasm at the prospect of a visit from the American Ambassador, NASA, and the Prime Minister of Australia. It's an ensemble piece crammed full with great supporting performances &#150; the young man obsessed with his Army training, the incompetent security guard who revels in carrying a gun, the politically rebellious Mayor's daughter determined to dampen everyone's enthusiasm &#150; and even Eliza Szonert ('Neighbours'' Dannii Stark, fact fans) comes out trumps in her role as local totty Janine.But where the film falters is that the main characters are also little more than well-rounded charicatures, defined by their jobs or their family, with only occasional glimpses of &#145;human interest' clumsily thrown at them in an effort to make them more complex. In a film such as this, where the real action is happening in outer space and the outcome is a forgone conclusion (we all know that man made it to the moon), what suspense there is must come from whether or not the individual characters succeed in their ambitions, and the gentle affection they provoke is, unfortunately, not quite enough to keep the audience on side.There are some hilarious moments of Aussie-American diplomacy &#150; the town band mistaking the &#145;Hawaii 5-0' theme for the U.S. National Anthem, for example &#150; but the full comedy of such situations is never quite realised, presumably to ensure no potential foreign audiences are offended. Indeed, 'The Dish' seems to go out of its way to be inoffensive to everyone, which some will find refreshing in the modern climate of comedy - but vulgarity, as we all know from 'Muriel's Wedding' and 'Priscilla', is what everyone expects from Australian cinema. Like its predecessor, 'The Castle', Rob Sitch's latest will not repeat overseas its incredible success back home, but one random Bank Holiday you'll see it on TV, and you'll like it. And thirty years later, you can make everyone born after 2010 feel sorry that they didn't see it when you did.

Four scientists and technicians have the honor of being part of a team responsible for communicating between Apollo 11 and Earth. This is the kind of movie where discussing the plot would bore most and do a disservice to the movie. The character interplay is great, the comedy is timed great and doesn't really get in the way of the movie. There are some subplots which, in my opinion, did get in the way, so it's not a perfect movie.What it is is a movie that you'll watch with a smile on your face for most of the time, and then at the end, find yourself holding back tears watching the amazing walk on the moon. I am too young to have seen the actual moon landing, but watching this movie almost made me feel like I was there when it first happened and all the world was watching. The feeling is hard to describe, but it's a mix between awe, pride, and wonder. If you're tired of the same Hollywood crap, this is a wonderful alternative.Finally, two comments about comments from another imdb member 1) Quoted due to a sudden power outage which wipes clean its computers, the radio telescope looses the lunar space craft...until the US NASA rep looks up at the sky and gets the brilliant idea that they should just point the dish up at sky where they can see the moon. You have missed the point. The solution was *not* to point the dish at the moon, the idea was to use the moon as a reference point. They knew where the spacecraft was, they had a good idea of speed, they did not have a vector. The moon provided a direction. By the way, yes, sometimes when trying to find a solution one way, you miss the obvious.  They were trying to calculate current position using old position/velocity data, and forgot to realize *where* they were going to. Trust me and my years of math and physics that this happens.2) quoted The only other major 'crisis' occurs when powerful winds kick up on cue just when the moonwalk transmission is about to occur...but, oddly, later the winds completely disappear. This is not a movie about aliens or waging war in space. It is an actual crisis within the parameters of the movie. As to why it oddly disappears later, I'm not sure it did (thought you may be right), only that it wasn't the focal point of the movie at that time -- and rightfully so. But even if it did, it matters little because the focal point of that part of the movie was the moonwalk.Watch this movie. Too many movies nowadays are mediocre. They're not bad, just forgettable.

It's one of only a few satellite dishes in the world (in Parkes, Australia) that got the job of broadcasting the moonwalk itself. Along with Kevin (Mitch Mitchell) the wisecracking engineer, Glenn (Tom Long), the lovesick but nerdy electronics guru, and Al (Patrick Puddy Warburton), the NASA guy who is there to make sure all goes well, this crew kept me in stitches most of the time. Not to mention Rudy, the gung-ho security guard who can't keep his sectors straight.Some people may turn their noses up at the rather cute tone of this film, but I found it refreshing. Parkes' mayor, who has to constantly consult his young son about the science of the rocket launch, plays small-town bureaucrat with style and spunk. The whole town is agog at the prospect of having an American ambassador AND the Prime Minister visit.Watching Glen translate Australian slang for American Al is hilarious. So is Kevin as he plays cricket in the dish. Not to mention the numerous mishaps that surround the broadcast. And Sam Neill plays the role of Cliff with staid, gentle strength.However, I think one of the most interesting points in the film has nothing to do with the cast. After the landing, a montage of different TV reporters/experts from around the world is shown. Some are in tears with amazement that a man has actually landed on the moon. Including dear old Walter Cronkite brushing back a few saltdrops. As Cliff (Neill) says, It's a chance for science to be daring. And it truly was.  "},{"Title":"Superb!

Sweet, nostalgic (soundtrack to die for), and non-cringey the chief Australian scientist is played with poise and presence by honorary Aussie Sam Neill, and though each of the team has his quirks, they are most certainly not a pack of galahs.Two points 1. this is a true story in spirit rather than fact, in that a lot of the crucial receiving was done not at Parkes but at smaller dishes in the mountains south of Canberra, which have since been demolished. The Parkes dish is still there, still does science, and is visitable by tourists. 2. The PM at the time was actually John Gorton, and is not named because JG is still alive.

When Al Burnett (Patrick Warburton 'Seinfield'), the American from N.A.S.A finds out, he's all nerves, procedure and protocol. The Australians just focus on fixing the problem. The ubiquitous She'll be right.'The Dish' is a screamingly funny, foot stomping take on Australia's role in the greatest moment of the twentieth century. Landing two men on the moon and bringing them back to Earth. When you think about that, it seems like a pretty serious moment to joke about.The characters in 'The Dish' are so familiar that you laugh, first, in recognition, and then, laugh louder and longer when they are given things to do and say. The Australian running Radio telescope at Parkes is Cliff Buxton (Sam Neill 'Jurassic Park', 'The Piano'), an older recently widowed man of quietly spoken, and very few words. It's clear that Cliff can listen patiently, almost transcendentally, to others for hours on end. Then, summarise it all including the outcome in four sentences or less, and leave the others in the room amazed and speechless. It's brave writing to have a lead character with few words, but it's this character and Al that keep 'The Dish' from collapsing under its souffle construction.Al Burnet before this calamity is still all procedure and process driven, inflexible, he runs incessant drills, checks and re checks, and his thoroughness really starts getting under the skin of the Australians. The Australians see it as being un trusting and treating them like idiots, and Cliff's number two, Mitch (Kevin Harrington 'Sea Change') doesn't mince words about this. Kevin is your laconic down to earth Aussie male. Wise cracking, tells you what you think (usually with an analogy), whether you wanted to know or not. Mitch loves ribbing his mates about any failure or indiscretion. This is why, you could argue, that checking and rechecking for the Australians isn't a focus. For the Australians, letting the team down and stuffing up will provide decades of ribbing and stirring at your expense. The shame of failure is not just this moment, but with Australians, will haunt you for the rest of your life, rubbing your face in it gently from your mates, and less so from your enemies. No 1969 wasp male could hope to survive that.The last of the main 'Dish' team is Glenn (Tom Long 'Strange Planet', 'Two Hands' 'Sea Change'). Glenn is the 1969 computer geek prototype. Shy almost seven dwarfian 'Bashful' in construct, he seems a little slow on the social skills and overly keen to explain and please. Cliff and Mitch watch his attempts to start a relationship with Janine, who brings lunches in brown paper bags like the lunch monitor from school. There is also the security guy Rudi, who's on L plates, and renames the sectors he protects whenever muddled. It's a lovely part played well by Taylor Kane.The other major character in this large ensemble film is Mayor Bob McIntyre (Roy Billing) who's political savvy at beating Cowra for the Radio Telescope delivers his and Parkes biggest day when the P.M and the American Ambassador come to watch the Moon landing from Parkes. Bob McIntyre is just a brilliant piece of writing and directing, and Roy Billing gives Bob such wonderful moments, that he's simply adorable'The Dish' is the funniest film I've seen this year. Beautifully written, directed, cast and acted, it is an ensemble film with characters you immediately embrace and care about. The characters all have their little quirks, which make them so very human in this super human story. Jayne Kennedy has cast the tiniest speaking roles with first class character actors including Collette Mann, Denise Richards and Billie Brown. This for an Australian film is refreshing, and is a key factor in 'The Dish's success.Finally, the tech credits, Direction, Editing (the brilliant Brunswick girl Jill Bilcock) , Cinematography, Production design and writing are all outstanding. Don't let this stuff about Post Olympics mood thing colour your vision. This is a brilliant film. Sitch's direction is immaculate and his actors deliver killer one liners, one after the other without failure and with apparent effortless ease.

With the Dish they have taken one of mankind's greatest achievements and captured it through Australian eyes.It is also no surprise that the characters are all well observed, the jokes perfectly timed and the acting spot on (especially Sam Neill and Roy Billing).What is surprising is the production values.  In the past the Working Dog crew have let the story do the talking - seeing lighting etc as a secondary concern.  But here the cinematography, editing and sets are close to perfect.However they never lapse into the showiness that plagues so many Australian films.  And compared to other Australian films you get the impression that these characters can be found anywhere in Australia, not just in cafes in inner-city Sydney or Melbourne or merely characters from American films transported to a local setting.Along with Chopper, Two Hands and of course the Castle, The Dish represents a rare breed of Australian film - one that is actually entertaining whilst at the same time being genuinely moving.

Having liked the Castle, which was made by the Working Dog team who also created The Dish (as the posters say in big bold writing), I knew the kind of witty, almost satirical humour this movie would have. It did have this humour as well as drama, emotion, love and of course the moon walk.

And even though I knew the outcome of the movie, I still went I wonder if they'll get out of this situation because it is the untold story of the moon walk. The drama's from the power going out to the winds being too strong, which can, if moved, make the dish (The satellite receiving the footage) collapse, killing everyone in it.All the performances in this movie are good especially Sam Niell but everyone, which includes almost the entire cast of Seachange...

The film is a whimsical look at the part played by Australia in Nasa's Apollo 11 mission, when man first walked on the moon. In particular, the movie looks at how Australia's Parkes Satellite Dish brought the first television pictures of Neil Armstrong walking on the moon to the rest of the world.However The Dish is a break-away from past efforts from Working Dog Productions (comprising comedians Santo Cilauro, Tom Gleisner, Jane Kennedy and Rob Sitch).If you are looking for another dose of rough-and-ready ocker comedy (like The Castle) you won't find it in The Dish. It appears that Working Dog was intent on creating a serious film for a world audience, and while it is an enjoyable, solid watch for the whole family, it lacks the biting humor of Frontline, The Castle or the d-generation.As long as you go into the movie aware that it is a slicker and more refined product, you will enjoy this movie very much.Some excellent performances (especially Sam Neill) enhance a very enjoyable script with some very funny moments -- and thankfully (or not, according to your perspective) it still has a go at the relaxed Australian culture of the day. (Who ever would have thought you could play cricket in a satellite dish).Working Dog has been responsible for other great entertainment such as the brilliant Australian current affairs satire Frontline (not to be confused with the American program of the same name) and the hit comedy film, The Castle, and popular Australian TV shows The Late Show and The Panel.

The reward, putting Parkes on the map, is the facility's assignment to help NASA in Houston with telemetry and communications signals for the Apollo 11 moon voyage and landing.Well-known actor Sam Neill (Jurassic Park, etc.) plays Cliff, the contemplative pipe-smoking director of the dish-management crew. Taylor Kane plays Rudi, the comical security guard who's on the alert for threats that aren't really quite there. Tom Long plays Glenn, the not-really-so-nerdy whiz kid who's the junior member of the team. He has a crush on Janine, Rudi's sister, played by Eliza Szonert, who has a crush back. Kevin Harrington plays Mitch, the wise-cracking Aussie who's second in command to Cliff, at least domestically. What tension there is, aside from that of the moon mission itself, derives from Mitch's discomfort with Al the add-on from NASA, played by Patrick Warburton. Mitch considers Al an annoying know-it-all presence, representative of an American arrogance that the Australians can't be trusted to be competent but have to be monitored.John McMartin plays the American ambassador who is greeted in Parkes with the, uh, U.S. national anthem.

In fact it is exactly this tension between recognizable human traits and technological wizardry, the ordinary and the exceptional, that gives the movie its soul and its humanity. This is a tribute to the scripting and direction as well as to the actors who convey the essential humanity in many fine performances. Sam Neill and Patrick Warburton have already established themselves as fine actors but their restraint and confidence here plays off the fine work of numerous supporting actors. I found the work of Roy Billing as Mayor Bob McIntyre virtually a constant joy - and one of the reasons, as has been noted, that one can watch this film again and again in its entirety and still find something new to enjoy, almost as if it transcended the label and conventions of film as entertainment, and instead riveted the audience with the commonest human feelings and frailties, conveyed with a deadpan sense of humor that is warm as well as wry. As several have already noted, Parkes is in New South Wales, solidly in the Murray Darling Basin which has been for a century the bread basket of Australia until being knocked sideways by a decade of drought and misapplication of its diminishing water resources.

In `Whisky Galore' it was hiding a wrecked shipment of Scotch on a Hebredian island, in `The Dish' it's ensuring the pictures of the first men on the moon in 1969 get back to earth via the Parkes radio telescope despite nationalism, bad weather, technical glitches and human error.I personally don't care how true all this was (apparently some long demolished site in the ACT actually did the job) but while some of the characters were charming in a familiar kind of way the whole thing lacked any real engagement. These Australians had a very bit part in this particular historical event &#150; its success did not ride on their efforts - and it was difficult to get really involved. Sam Neil did his middle-aged angst number, Tom Long was one of those bumbling young men it's hard to dislike and there was a gallery of well-known actors in the minor parts, Carl Snell's Mayor MacIntyre being very good, though I kept on expecting to see Bill Hunter appear. I wonder what non-Australians think of this rather ethnocentric number. I watched the thing as an in-flight movie and I noticed the Asian passengers around me switched it off pretty quickly.

But it isn't.It's most definitely a cute film, and it's most definitely got an interesting little historical story to tell. But as a story, it goes nowhere and as a comedy, it has considerably fewer laughs than The Castle.It's probably easiest to cite the things the screenplay hasn't got. It hasn't got significant character development. All the characters, including Mr NASA, are there when we arrive. Apparently Mr NASA has ruffled a few feathers at the station, although we have no idea how because there's only one fairly minor altercation shown to us. The romance plot barely advances at all. The vague references to Sam Neill's character being married... followed by a dramatic pause suggest a big plot twist that never arrives. For all the rhetoric spouted by the characters about how bloody marvellous this whole mission is, it doesn't seem to change them. And the tension surrounding the various technical hitches is fleeting.This film has its moments, usually when it goes for straight out laughs - the mayor and his wife, Rudy the security guard and the poetry reading are very good - but there's a lot more of those moments, and the characters share the laughs more evenly, in The Castle.Perhaps The Castle or the film's publicity led me to expect too much, but this subject matter could've been dealt with so much better. In view of all the positive comments, I'd have to say it's worth a look, but you might want to wait til it comes out on video.

But, what you may not be aware of is the circumstances behind the actual transmissions. If you think it was all overseen by the Americans, think again. It was down to a telescope, smack dab in the middle of a sheep paddock in Parkes, Australia that transmitted Neil Armstrong's most famous walk.The Dish is one of the most gracious films to emerge this side of the millennium. A charming, very enjoyable re-examining of one of the world's most important events. Its enjoyable for the way it tells a story just a little off to the side. A story that neighbours the main event, but is no less compelling.The Apollo 11 Moon landing is the underlying theme and dramatic thrust of the film, and its this that ties the major plot points of The Dish together. But instead of seeing Mission Control and the astronauts, the film focuses instead on dramas of a more personal level.The town of Parkes has the largest telescope on the Southern Hemisphere, but up until now, its only been used to survey the stars and not much else. That is, until NASA chooses Parkes as the backup relay for the Moon landing. They're only a backup if something should go wrong, but they don't care. To them, this is a momentous day not only for Parkes, but for all of Australia.The team of technicians chosen to oversee this is chief scientist Cliff Buxton (a quietly dignified Sam Neill), Glenn, who's in charge of plotting the telemetry of the dish, and Mitch who's job is to make sure all the equipment does what it's supposed to do. As well as a NASA representative Al Burnet (a milquetoast Patrick Wharbuton), and the dish's inept security guard Rudi, the five of them have to work around the clock to get the dish up and running in time for the Moon landing.If that's all there was to The Dish, it would run out of steam pretty quickly. But director Rob Sitch makes sure that doesn't happen by not allowing the technicalities of the mission to steal the show. That's just a convenient hook to hang the story on. Sitch wisely allows the performances of the cast and the emotional strengths he draws out in the process to carry the show.And it has to be said Sitch has assembled a fine cast. At the head of the line is Sam Neill, who is excellent as always. Its a subtle and underplayed performance, but he handles the changes in his emotions expertly. Making sure things go to plan, and keeping a cool head even when they don't. And there's quite a lovely scene when he discusses the loss of his wife on the outside of the dish while its being readjusted.There's some fine ensemble playing from the staff of the dish. Glenn is a fumbling maths genius with a crush on the prettiest girl in Parkes. Mitch is the nuts and cogs of the mission, even if he's missing a few screws from time to time. And Rudi is so terrible at what he does that I think he's kept on just for moral support.But its Patrick Wharbuton who shines among the supporting cast. He does wonders with what could have been a very clich√©d character. He's the Yank among the group. Who doesn't always get along with the Aussies. I like the parts when Glenn has to translate Mitch's colloquialisms for Al's benefit. Al may be a steadfast, All-American boy but when the chips are down, he supports the team. And the success of the mission couldn't have happened without him. When they're faced with a potentially crippling problem, the solution he comes up with is so simple you feel like slapping yourself for not thinking of it earlier.And outside of the staff, Sitch creates some extremely endearing townsfolk. In particular the Mayor of Parkes, Bob McIntyre and his wife Maisie (Roy Billing & Genevieve Mooy). Bob could have been played as a pompous bureaucrat, but Billing turns him into a likable opportunist instead. Because its not every day something this momentous happens in Parkes. So he capitalises as much as he can possibly get from it. He still fumbles things a bit, especially when he mistakes the theme tune of Hawaii-Five-O for the American National Anthem.Sitch attempts to introduce some tension into the mix as well, such as power cuts and high winds that jeopardise the mission. Even so, Sitch still gets some comic mileage out of them. I love the part when they lose contact with Apollo 11, and when it coincides with a visit from the Prime Minister, Al and Mitch have to pretend to be Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin over Rudi's radio to offset suspicion. After all, they don't want the plug pulled on their moment in history. And who could blame them!?There is also a wonderful selection of tunes and backing music to sift through. Sitch has picked some of the 60s greatest hits. Especially when he has the realignment of the dish accompanied to the sound of 'Classical Gas'. Its quite a lovely and strangely exhilarating moment that reminded me of Stanley Kubrick's use of music in 2001 A Space Odyssey.Despite some of the obvious hiccoughs that threaten to derail the mission, in the end, we know it will succeed. And so it should. These people deserve their moment in the Sun. The saddest thing is their involvement in one of mankind's greatest achievements went unnoticed by the public. But for every person that discovers The Dish, Parkes will always have a place in your heart.

So good was the Parkes signal that nine minutes into the broadcast, NASA decided to stick with it for the remainder of mankind's arrival on an alien world. 'The Dish' chronicles the events leading up to the broadcast, focussing upon the individuals responsible for bringing the world those memorable moments, and the impact it had on the local community, keen to bathe in the reflected glory of the event.Realistically, the Parkes story is one of a group of astrophysicists flicking switches, calculating trajectories and talking via satellite to NASA - all of which translates into their worthy achievements in helping televise a key chapter in human history, but not exactly the stuff of cinema. Therefore, much of 'The Dish' is highly fictionalised and speculative, with Working Dog painting the affair in nostalgic sepia and providing a fairly romanticised view of a rural Australian community, replete with sixties pop songs and the kind of cheeky and amusing Australian characters that exist only in film. The waters of schmaltz ought to drown the whole effort in its cheesiness, but it doesn't. The makers of 'Frontline' and 'The Castle' are in 2000 at the height of their powers, and although 'The Dish' doesn't have quite the same depth of the former or the emotional resonance of the latter, Working Dog are too skilled to descend into Disnification.Rob Sitch's direction ensures that the softer approach is never two-dimensional and that the fictionalised elements of the film don't eclipse the central story at the observatory, but rather complement it as an engaging backdrop. Credit here should go to the Working Dog team as a whole, who as usual crafted their script together, bringing the same unity of vision their earlier successes enjoyed. Real media coverage of the Apollo mission is blended in seamlessly, helping the viewer to really get into the spirit of things.Jane Kennedy assembles a capable cast, headed by Sam Neill as observatory director Cliff Buxton. The film's lightheartedness does not present Neill with a real test of his abilities, but within his character's back story, there are occasional depths the veteran actor subtly brings to the surface. Fresh from their Pearl Bay success, actors Kevin Harrington and Tom Long are on hand for comic relief, Harrington tasked with evoking the insecure rivalry between the Australian contingent and NASA, in the form of Patrick Warburton, in a more restrained performance than usual. Comment should also be made of the always-reliable Roy Billing as the town mayor, very much aware of the benefits the observatory's success will have on his career, yet sincerely fascinated by and appreciative of the event's true significance. Essentially, the principal characters of 'The Dish' are likable and inspire you to cheer for them in their moments of difficulty.For all this, 'The Dish' however lacks the depth of story that would justify feature length. In their attempts to bolster the tale, Working Dog add elements of romance and conflict, but their own desire for lightheartedness prevents either of these elements from really developing into anything powerful enough to fully warrant their presence. One gets the sense that this is the producers' deliberate attempt to avoid sensationalising their story, but once introduced, the sub-plots are there and have to be properly acknowledged. The Working Dog approach may have been better suited therefore to the short film genre, cutting out the half-developed side material and sticking with the central plot. This is essentially the difference between a story centred around the technical achievements at an observatory and one centred around the plight of a family trying to keep their home. 'The Castle', with its solid human core, had far more material upon which to draw a feature-length story, and every plot element came into being organically, rather than needing to be grafted on in order to *find* human interest. Ironically, with its focus on 'loveable rednecks', 'The Castle' will not have the more widespread appeal of 'The Dish's softly-drawn characters and sleepy-town charm, and they are very different beasts.It's important to state at this point therefore that I did enjoy 'The Dish' a great deal. Its subject matter is no less deserving and it is well-crafted despite its faults. It simply isn't as good as Working Dog's finest, and their standards in the 90s were very high indeed. It's a great shame that 'The Dish' is to date their final foray into cinema a decade on and they should by now have had a string of great Australian film classics rather than the often mainstream and lacklustre television efforts they have produced instead. Yet despite its faults, I would cite 'The Dish' as the last of a decade of excellence rather than a harbinger of the fall that would swiftly follow. It may not be quite up to 101 minutes of runtime, but it's still a worthy effort I can recommend to others.

The small town of Parks suddenly finds itself the focus of the world, with the Mayor becoming a local celebrity, meeting and greeting American and Australia dignitaries alike. With the pressure on and a NASA manager in Parks to oversee the mission, the eyes of the world must rely on a small group of Australians managed by facility director Cliff Buxton.I'm not sure how entirely accurate and factual it is (certainly there are some glaring omissions and additions) but this film serves as an affectionate record of a small part of history in an unassuming corner of the world. I half expected a Aussie spoof with the usual broad caricatures and so on and, to a degree this was the case but the vast majority of the film was a gently comic drama with its foundations in fact. I found it a bit distracting not knowing what exactly what was true and what wasn't but gradually I settled down into it and found myself quite engaged by it. The story itself is light drama &#150; important in a bigger context perhaps but still worries over wind etc, so it is a credit to the film that it makes an engaging story out of it where it could have fallen flat. The comedy is also a light touch and there are some nice digs at the perception of Aussie life but it is never to the point of making them the joke or being cruel.The cast are fine with this approach and turn in mostly straight performances that allow the laughs to just come out from their characters rather than being attacks on their characters. Neill leads the cast well with a gentle leader role who does provide a solid heart to the film. He is well supported by a group of actors who aren't as good as him but are enjoyable with their own small characters. Warburton is stiff as in Seinfeld but he is good nonetheless while Harrington, Long and others provide solid supporting turns.Overall this is not an amazing film but it is gently engaging and amusing. It isn't hilarious at any point and it isn't the tensest drama you'll ever see but it is warmly fun and I quite enjoyed it. If you can get into the light mood of it then you'll probably get it too.

Because, even if I don't say so, I love you as much as one can love. At the time when the film is set (1969), this opera still hadn't been taken out of the cobwebs like it would be later in the 70's, 80's and 90's. In other words, the only reason why this aria was used at all was its absolute musical transcendence, as far removed from the ambient Australian folksiness as possible, and the fact that it was written by Massenet, an opera composer whose incidental music and orchestrations are still being studied by film composers today. Since I am a fan of Massenet, my better judgement was absolutely overwhelmed at this point, I got a lump in my throat and I was absolutely willing to let myself be engulfed by the story. What a sucker I am!

Films I enjoy are such as Pride and Prejudice and The Titfield Thunderbolt as well as old world films such as those following the second war. The acting might be hammy but the themes are lovely and I put The Dish in the category of the Titfield Thunderbolt but somewhat better performance. I wish they made more films like this today, free of foul language like the Full Monty and similar. Films depicting homosexuality I find totally disgusting and should be banned. The Disc is a lovely film and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good yarn.

For tools for whom high adventure is getting the         settings right on their color monitor. Aussie quartet of techies         manning the world's largest radio antenna, are thrust into the         world's eye by having to serve as the world's eye, that is by         being called upon in July 1969 to receive the transmission of         man's first walk on the moon. Add 1) several tablespoons of 60's         nostalgia--you know, hair-do's, fashions, vintage cars, and tacky         pop tunes; 2) a cup or two of archival news footage of the real         thing; and 3) cute small-town sit-com caricatures; shake and         bake; and you have an instant cake of manufactured history,         nostalgia to go.        Get this due to a sudden power outage which wipes clean its         computers, the radio telescope looses the lunar space craft.         After covering up their problem to NASA back in Houston, the crew         of brilliant scientists stay up all night, racking their brains,         calculating feverishly with slide rulers, only to realize, come         morning, that they have nothing; that is, until the US NASA rep         looks up at the sky and gets the brilliant idea that they should         just point the dish up at sky where they can see the moon.        The only other major crisis occurs when powerful winds kick up         on cue just when the moonwalk transmission is about to occur. The         geeks sweat and balk at the risk because the dish wasn't built to         withstand such high winds and is therefore untested under these         conditions; but at the last, during their one big moment, decide         to tough it out, to meet the challenge of destiny. Of course,         they receive the transmission without a hitch (no spoilers are         necessary since everything in this movie is a foregone         conclusion), but, oddly, the winds completely disappear.         Throughout the moonwalk, which is the movie's climax, the winds which were supposed to be such a big hazard to the dish, are         suddenly gone. So much for continuity.        One minor quibble the male lead's hairpiece is so bad it's         distracting.        This movie is highly recommended ... for nursing homes.

So here was a chance for the Little Guys to triumph. Now, nobody does lovable, quirky eccentrics like the Australian film industry and this film is filled to the brim with them. I really wanted to love this movie and the movie wanted me to love it. Alas, it was not to be. Syrupy music intrudes constantly. There are not really any surprises. The acting is mostly on a TV sit-com level. Everything seemed manufactured. It is a shame not to be able to recommend it.

It is a small story of a huge event which is loveable, really loveable but just not enough. It has obviously had a small budget and that is very apparent, but for all its smallities it is a great film. The story itself is in no way depleted from, not even in the possibilities of national heroicism. The cast is made up from almost unknown actors, with the obvious exception, I say unknown, but that is limited to the amount of irregular movie-goers, for it is made up from very capable character actors, who have been sorely mis-used over the years. That is the films true striking rich gift. None of the actors try in any way to over-shadow the others. Even the smallest roles are executed perfectly, with enough comic timing to applaud. However, as I mentioned, that is the movies downfall. It never tries to be too challenging, the plotting is slight, which lends itself to being a character led comedy. Whereas the volume of material is never really too substantial, the delivery of lines is almost perfect. There is a definite knack of how to give the line and reward must be given to the director for this. The acting, aside form the comic elements are fairly accomplished.The bottom line must be brought back, once again, to the fact that there is never too much to focus on. Leaving the theatre you are sure to be saying to yourself that there was nothing wrong with the movie, which is true. However, there are many movies that have nothing wrong with them, but at the same time do not try too make much all right.Go away from the cinema realising you have seen a good film which will, within a few weeks just blow away and hardly anyone will see.Its a shame that suck movies are neglected but in the age of the block-buster you need to push boundaries.

The one exception to this to date is the outfit's movie output - The Castle left me cold, and The Dish, while streets ahead of its predecessor in terms of production > values and photography, is quite possibly even less engaging.This movie fails on so many fronts the script is leaden and obvious, rife with stock-standard situations (big smoke vs country attitudes, American/Australian conflict) and not-terrifically-creative dialogue. Some truly broad acting performances were turned in by the supporting (though not, I must stress, the principal) cast. The soundtrack suffered from Forrest Gump disease - studded with pop tunes that may evoke wonderful memories in the minds of those who lived through the era, but just seem like empty window dressing to the rest of us. What purpose do the subplots that go nowhere (eg, Lenka Kripac and her army-cadet, would-be boyfriend) serve? Surely not comic relief? And why has Tom Long been asked to give a virtual repeat performance of his SeaChange hesitant-suitor role? He does it well, and it's funny and, yes, kind of touching; but it's not new, for him or us.Like a lot of Australians my age, I grew up watching Santo, Rob, Tom and the others on the TV, and I suppose I, like many, take a kind of proprietary interest in their careers. So my message to them is - ignore the half-truth of big box-office receipts and please try harder. We all know you can.

There's lots of mileage in the moon landings (ahem) especially when something goes wrong though Apollo 11, the mission in this film, was a success, there is drama a-plenty to be had in the parochial-and-proud Aussie outfit that was co-opted by NASA to broadcast the TV pictures the mission was sending.Sam Neill plays Cliff Buxton, the team leader of the local team. His is the avuncular role, equal parts easy-going and ill-disguised nervous wreck. Patrick Warburton is the NASA rep Al Burnett who doesn't help matters with his over-officiousness Kevin Harrington is the dial-an-Oz loudmouth and the Tom Long the witless naive who also has a romantic subplot to keep things moist. The drama works on the basis of race-against time cliffhangers.

It's full of thrills and chills as they battle meteor storms and a Russian plot to destroy the craft on the ground which is averted at the last minute by a commando operation led by.  Oh, come on, you say.  They would never do something as stupid as rewriting the history of the Apollo moon landings, even changing the names, right?  Actually, Hollywood has a habit of rewriting history all of the time.  This movie is a good example of this (for the most egregious and ridiculous example, see Memphis Belle, which only resembles reality in the name of the aircraft).  In `The Dish', all of the names are changed, the personnel are different, the structure of the project is different, and `exciting crisis' are added.  So, you don't get to know what part of history is correct (the high winds) and what part is bogus (the power failure).  You miss the idea of what part Parkes actually played and the technical achievement it took.  You get the idea that this was some small operation that got `invited' to help, missing the huge infrastructure they had to build to support the operation.  You don't see the incredible skill of the operators, some of whom did not get to see the very landing they were helping relay the video from because they had complex jobs to do. Truly fascinating stories, such as the inadvertent destruction of the scan converter and its rebuild using scavenged parts, are omitted in favor of things like the project director's `dead wife' plotline (also fiction; in reality, she was the one with the picnic baskets).  This is a fun movie to watch, but imagine how much more significant it could have been if it had chosen to tell the real story.

Sounds easy. But when the antenna is run by a little but odd collection of men and the mayor, the American ambassador and the premier minister all taking an interest.Comments An most average comedy. I liked it but it wasn't anything special, not at all. Why not? It's a nice story, but for it to really take off, the story needs something more. Here I think it being based on a true story is a little constricting. For real life it sure would have been eventful and stressing, but it doesn't really cut it for a good comedy.However, what can make it a lot better, and give it some lift is if you're a space enthusiast or want to remember one of the world's greatest events, where for a few moments the entire world connected around a single event.
