The first time we see D'Artagnan fight, there doesn't seem to be any point to it, other than the fact to let us know that he's this amazingly (and somewhat unbelievably) skilled swordsman and fighter.  He also escapes the situation way too easily, thanks to pathetic bluff and a cut away.The only saving grace in this film (in my opinion) is Tim Roth, who had to make due as best he could with a very bad script.  But he looked cool (the only person in this film with any fashion sense whatsoever).  Although later in the film he appears to have borrowed his Aunt Ida's - Sunday church revival meeting hat.Stephen Rea, who I usually find extremely enjoyable to watch - came across as very ineffectual as the Cardinal Richelieu.  Instead of being the great evil and manipulating mastermind, he almost seemed the puppet of Tim Roth's Febre...a character I've never heard of before, who seemed to fill the role previously occupied by Rochefort, as the one eyed man who killed D'Artagnan's father.(oh for Tim Curry's Richelieu)Justin Chamberlain is incredibly dull in this movie, and never seemed to show any emotion.  It almost seemed like he sucked the life out of the actors around him.  His character comes across as a thinly veiled Bruce Wayne.  A young boy who watched his parents get murdered in front of him, but could do nothing.  He's taken in by the kindly older friend of his father's.  He then grows up and trains himself to be the best fighter, to become a hero and stop what happened to his parents from happening again.Athos, Porthos and Aramis might as well not even have been in the film. All of the Musketeers were portrayed as drunken, miserable, arrogant, lazy jerks.  Apparently D'Artagnan is the only one who still holds the ideals of the Musketeers.  It seemed like Athos was only there to avoid the question - Shouldn't there be 3 of them?  He didn't do a damn thing.  They gave all of his character traits to Aramis, and Aramis the wouldbe priest was nowhere to be found.King Louis XIII and Queen Anne were in their late 50's (huh?) and were childless.  Okay, where do Louis XIV and Phillipe come from then?  I somehow doubt that a woman in her late 50's in 17th century France would be up to having twins.  As far as I know, they should have been young, and not even married yet.The Musketeers all seemed closer in age to their Man in the Iron Mask selves, than their Three Musketeers selves.  Athos even had grey in his beard.You would think that the King's Musketeers could have afforded to dress better.  Everyone looked like a bum...and there were a LOT of bad hats in this movie.  D'Artagnan looked like he should have been riding the range in 1880's Oklahoma.  And don't even get me started on the mullets.  Did everyone in 17th century France grow up in the 1980's?  The hair extensions on Justin Chamberlain were pretty bad too.The romance between his character and Mena Suvari didn't make much sense, and seemed very forced.  Although it gave D'Artagnan an excuse to go skinny dipping so the bad guys could kidnap his girlfriend.Bad bad bad dialogue.  When Mena Suvari threatened to cut off someone's balls...I pretty much gave up all hope.The action and fight sequences were way over the top.  Apparently the Cardinal makes sure his men are well versed in the fine art of - How to engage in a swordfight while hanging 100 feet in the air one handed from a rope in the rain and not fall to your death.  The final fight between D'Artagnan and Febre (in what we dubbed The Ladder Room) was too much. It seems the ladders are strong enough to support two grown men who are jumping and balancing on them, but are powerless when it comes to the mighty rapier blade.  It got to the point where I was thinking - for crying out loud, would you just stand still and fight already!D'Artagnan also has this amazing horse that appears out of nowhere when he whistles (despite having run off in a different direction earlier, or having been left lying in the road practically dead that morning).What I found interesting is, it seems that the Musketeers all bought their cassaque cloaks at Disney's The Three Musketeers wardrobe sale.  They looked EXACTLY like the ones worn by Kiefer, Charlie and Oliver...right down the length, colours and embroidery.One of the most confusing moments came when it looked as though a character had been fatally shot, only to remark - I'm not dead.  But there is no clear explanation as to why they aren't dead, and show up later no worse for wear.I guess the palace kitchen staff are very stupid, as none of them realize that some of them have been replaced by imposters, nor does anyone notice that one of the waiters is wearing a sword...well okay, one person notices, but that scene is silly and kinda creepy.Oh and the swords are all pretty ugly.  I'm also trying to figure out, why if they hired a Hong Kong fight director to do all the choreography, did they also have a sword master?Well that's my Musketeer rant.  As always that's just my opinion, I could be wrong.

What is more for me it's also a very strong contender for being called one of the worst movies ever. Actually this rubbish has nothing to do with classic Dumas' Three Musketeers. For unknown reason screenwriters changed simply everything and in the result they got silly and laughable story filled with numerous plot holes and anachronisms. Dialogs look like they were written by a modern teenager and somehow characters development was totally forgotten. No one cares about movie's characters, they're uninteresting and pathetic while the whole movie is emotionally flat practically all the time. Poor direction leave room only for pointless action with ridiculously made in Eastern style fight scenes sometimes mixed with silly jokes. Add to all this horrible acting and most likely you'll get a well-deserved position in your all-time worst list. Absolute waste of 40 million dollars as well as your precious time and money.

For one thing, it seems to try and hang on to some parts of the story by Dumas, and yet it also is an entirely different story. Seemingly, the only real similarities are the names of the characters. This movie would be much more effective if it was entirely its own story, and not using the names of the famous characters. The reason? This movie totally dashes the names of those characters.The most unsettling part for me was the fact that the Three Musketeers are nothing like themselves. Porthos is not the least bit arrogant or over-the-top. Aramis isn't religious at all. And Athos does not even remotely resemble the character in the book. Sadly, Justin Chambers makes a better d'Artagnan than Chris O' Donnell, but only because he doesn't do any acting at all, which is better than the profuse overacting of O' Donnell. And Stephen Rea is a good actor, but his character isn't remotely as menacing as Richelieu should be.With all of that said, if you just view it as a movie, and try to block the actual story out of your mind, it can be entertaining. The fight scenes are very well done, and the pacing keeps the viewer interested. Perhaps this movie could have been really good if it was about the story of a musketeer NOT named d'Artagnan, and his unique adventure. But since it tries to be an interpretation of Dumas, it falls miserably short. As a movie, it is so-so, but as far as an interpretation of the famous story, it is absolutely terrible.

And then there's Tim Roth. He works, not just walks through as Deneuve and Rea. I'm convinced that he is not a bad character actor, but that he acts as a bad character actor acting a part above his head.

The action is great, but completely out of historical reality, then again its a movie, not a documentary. Entertaining? Yes, I thought so. Not as much as seeing Oliver Reed and Micheal York. As bad as the lead was, he was Oscar caliber compared to the absolutely useless Chis O'Donnell in the 1993 version. Given a choice between the 1993 version and this movie, I'd take this one.If you want a good swashbuckler, stick to Errol Flynn, or even Mask of Zorro. If you want Musketeers see the 1973/74 version.

It's Three Musketeers, nuff said. However this time, it has action choreographed by Hong Kong master Xin Xin Xiong (martials arts buffs among you may recognize the name).Neat production values and some interesting kung-fu/swashbuckling set pieces, like sword duels on the side of a tower or across ladders, aside, this is a really dull, lackluster version of the classic adventure (at least W.S' mess had some steampunk thrown in, and even Disney gave us the forever badass Michael Wincott and a rather amusing Oliver Platt). OH BOY, OH BOY, where to start? Well, the performances are flat-as- shot-tires all around, with the normally terrific Stephen Rea as a seemingly always monotone Richeleu being especially inexcusable. Mix that with thin characters that aren't engaging or lively in the slightest, and a plot that oversimplifies the story absurdly to focus solely on D'Artagnan, making the other Musketeers almost redundant, as well as even more lifeless (the witty repartee and banter, as well as 'All for One' friendship that almost every other version has? Completely Absent). And as if this cake needed more icing, the utterly generic score from the otherwise talented David Arnold (Stargate, Sherlock) that doesn't do much adrenaline pumping, nor has any real whimsy or levity to it.In the end, this is the text-book definition of 'unnecessary'. The concept of swashbuckling + kung fu should make for, at least, good cheesy fun, but when that is the ONE and ONLY thing your movie has going for it, you have officially failed as a film maker.

There *is* chemistry between the Queen and D'artagnan thanks to Catherine Deneuve who exudes star quality in every scene she's in. There are some nice performances from most of the character actors, the original 3 musketeers are great, and the humor if not the plot is very in keeping with the book. I first thought this was a made for TV movie because of the credits at the beginning so I wasn't really expecting much and this definitely beat my expectations. The movie looks good and aside from a few characters most of them seem fairly real, the balance between schtick and too- serious was handled well.Overall, too many faults to be a classic but definitely enough class and fun to be very entertaining.

He sets out to avenge the murder of his parents and finds his country cleaved by chaos and civil unrest. His heart softens only for Francesca, a fiery peasant girl who claims D'Artagnan's heart on sight. D'Artagnan, after witnessing his unarmed parents slain by the evil Febre ,grows up wanting to be a musketeer, one of King Louis XIII's loyal protectors. Upon arriving in Paris, however, he finds that the Musketeers have been disbanded by order of Cardinal Richelieu, who is usurping the king's authority with the help of his lethal henchman, Febre.Traveling to Paris, D'Artagnan verbally spars with witless quip- spouting musketeers Aramis, Athos and Porthos. D'Artagnan heads off guarding the queen, who is traveling incognito as a commoner on her way to meet Lord Buckingham. The evil Febre, his leash held loosely by the evil Cardinal Richilieu, wants to kill the Queen in order to sow unrest and war, which would create opportunities to profit, a war between France and England.The Musketeer is a film that relies mainly of cheesy action scenes mostly on cheesy and unrealistic swordplay.Aside from that,it also has poor story that makes minimized Dumas' classic into a forgettable novel.

Bad dialogue, stupid things happening, terrible casting...The costumes and the scenery were lovely, more waste.About that casting Stephen Rea is a highly respected actor with an impressive body of work, but he's no Richelieu!

The tiny glimpses we got of Athos never permitted him to deliver the promised complexity Musketeer fans know and love. WRONG. WRONG. WRONG.

One problem I would agree with is that at times the fight scenes are not shown off very well at all, parts are to dark and camera angles are not always good but generally it's watchable and you see the best parts.  I would recomend this film for the entertainment and enjoyable value of it not bad at all.  Another period, martial arts film I would recomend is brotherhood of the wolf, that offers a little more in terms of script but less in terms of swashbuckling.

So many others complain that the movie does not follow the book.  Well I hope those who made those comments actually read the book and actually listened to the movie preview...The Musketeer is supposed to be a re-imagined version of the The Three Musketeers not a page by page re-enactment of the novel.Ok, I'll admit some of the fight scenes were ridiculous but nothing that the film-maker didn't warn the audience about,so unless you went into the movie theater blind folded or never saw a martial arts movie, you knew what to expect from a martial arts movie director.If you haven't read the novel, I recommend you do, it is an unforgettable experience.  D'Artagnan was an arrogant young man, and he spoke dryly, as Justin Chambers portrayed his character in this movie.  Justin still has a lot of maturing to do as an actor, but nonetheless, he did a good job at capturing D'Artagnan's character as Alexandre Dumas might have invisioned him.It is obvious that the screenplay writers did not write word for word, they simply summarized the most important scenes from the novel.  D'Artagnan watching his parents get murdered, him seeking revenge, wanting to become a musketeer like his father, the way he met Athos, Porthos, and Aramis.  The political atmosphere of the time was the same as it was in the book, and our antagonist, was of course as evil as a summarized version can get.What about the cinematography?  Yes it was dark, it was in a way, the director's way of making a movie that was packed with ridiculous action and two well choreographed fight scenes a little more serious.  France was at its worst with Spain and England ready to declare war.  Hunger and poverty plagued the country.  The movie had to be dark, characters had to be in the shadows, this was not the happiest and brightest period of France's history. In his novel, Alexandre Dumas makes it clear that his novel was not just about an awesome adventure but also about history.All in all, I like the movie,I am not ashamed to admit it.  It was fun, and re-imagined, so people should not get too caught up about the story line. One question still remains...why is it that people get all caught up in Justin Chambers' looks?  Did people complain about Christopher Reve in Superman or Val Kilmer in Batman, lets admit it, people like attractive protagonists...hello...this is Hollywood!!! what do you  expect?

As a young man seeking justice, he travels to Paris and hooks up with the three Musketeers (Nick Moran, Steve Speirs and Jan-Gregor Kremp). Meanwhile he takes a fancy to fiery chambermaid, Francesca (Mena Suvari), who is the daughter of the deceased seamstress to the Queen (Catherine Deneuve). Stephen Rea plays the corrupt and despicable Cardinal Richelieu.While people love to loathe this film I enjoyed it quite a bit. It was directed by Peter Hyams (director of 1999's End of Days) and comes across as a less-grim Conan tale switched to 17th century France and plays like 1995's Rob Roy with a kinetic Indiana Jones flair, albeit set in France rather than Scotland. The tone is essentially realistic until the swashbuckling scenes take place, which are dynamic, but totally over-the-top.If you're a fan of the Conan, Rob Roy, Indiana Jones, Sinbad and Zorro flicks I think you'll appreciate this movie. It's as good or better than most of them. No kidding. Beyond the thrilling action sequences, there are a number of great or near-great elements Chambers plays a great protagonist and Roth the perfect villain, the latter proved in Rob Roy (he's just as wicked here). Not to mention, the lovely Mena is formidable as the babe. But it's the excellent sets and mood that I like most &#x96; the cobblestone streets, torches, horses & carriages, villages, castles and 17th century costuming. It's inexplicable that Chambers didn't go on to become a star, like Brad Pitt.

But this exhibition is only featured near the end of the movie where the lazy art direction is nothing more than an array of dark, isolated cramped rooms with ladders aplenty. Our hero is an incoherent mumbling protagonist D'Artagnan (Justin Chambers) as he engages into battle with the evil homicidal manic Febre (Tim Roth) in a fight to the death where our rivals awkwardly crash and stagger in a narrow room and just for flawed entertainment, they play teeter-totter on a ladder balanced onto a beam. Like all the other action scenes in this movie, the final battle lacks in any kind of engaging or exciting value. All that campfire lumber is crammed and scattered all over the place makes the fight scenes very hard to move around. What makes matters worse is that the editing is frenzied with poorly constructed jump-cut rhythm. The choreography is one of the most graceless and confusing display that I have seen in a long time. It also lacks in enthusiasm and cheerfulness. The death scene near the end was also displayed quite mundanely you wouldn't know what hit till it bites you in the lower crevices to the human anatomy. Peter Hyams is the director of this insult to Alexandre Dumas and also served as the cinematographer. The film may look old school, but it serves as a new school denomination which means the old school fight scenes are replaced by new methods to fit the modern spirit. For instance the wide-view angle of a royal carriage being drawn by horsemen and a castle is being under attack falls into a disjointed mess and makes you ponder what has just transpired and the scene-setting logistics never panned out to begin with. Also in terms of dramatic integrity, it has trouble deciding whether it wants to be filmed as an old school Errol Flynn traditional costume period piece or the more modernized MTV with the more modern language and movements. The end is neither seems to work. In the performance department, Justin Chambers looks and fit part quite authentically. But one he opens his mouth, well that's a whole different neck of the woods. His voice is so monotone and dry, that he's less entertaining than watching paint dry. Mena Suvari fares better as his peasant lover Francesca and has a gleaming bit of charm in her eye, but the lines fed to her in the script written by Gene Quintano is enough to make you want to poke your eyes out with a stick (especially a blatant sexual remark while dressed in period piece apparel was what took the cake). To the supporting cast members, Catherine Devenue was the best performer here as the kindred Queen of France who along with Francesca was held captive by the evil Febre (Tim Roth). With grace and style, Devenue was everything you would expect in an Alexandre Dumas novel. Stephen Rea is the second in line to great performances here as he captures the political state of mind in the time period as the equally diabolical Cardinal Richelieu who want nothing more than to overthrow the power of the King and Queen. And finally Tim Roth looks and acts too much like a villain character in cartoon show and just can't seem to play off his role because his performance is too far out there from reality. The most accurate thing about The Musketeer is that the city of Paris was waddling in its filth as the cobblestone roads were saturated with mud and debris and the taverns are filled with drunken slaves and slobs. It makes you wonder why our leading stars are meandering these condemned streets in clothing that looks quite uncomfortable? Hey? Am I missing something here? What's the point of me reviewing a movie about The Musketeer without giving mention to the swashbuckling triad The Three Musketeers? I mean D'Artagnan's allies Aramis (Nick Moran), Porthos (Steve Speirs) and Athos (Jan Gregor Kremp) are only on sporadically, there really isn't much to talk about here. There mentioning is just a mere cry for help to appease the die-hard action junkie. Sure their iconic battle cry All for one and one for all can be echoed through the realms of this film repeatedly, but it never comes to full effect.

An odd fusion of influences, for sure. Many viewers will be turned off by the idea even before the credits roll, but I wanted to give the film a chance before judging it. Alas, this is one of those occasions where the mocking critics are proved right - The Musketeer is a huge disappointment, a dispiriting romp singularly lacking in wit, entertainment or any sense of meaningful narrative. It avoids a one-star rating simply because a couple of action sequences are interestingly choreographed and Tim Roth is good as a vile villain. On every other level the film is an abject failure.Raised by former musketeer Plachet (Jean-Pierre Castaldi) following the murder of his parents, D'Artagnan (Justin Chambers) grows up dreaming of becoming a musketeer himself. Unfortunately, by the time he is old enough and skilled enough to go to Paris to fulfil his dream, the musketeers have been disbanded by the scheming Cardinal Richlieu (Steven Rea). Richlieu is busily manipulating events in France, trying to create uneasy tensions between his own country and Britain and Spain, with help from his sinister one-eyed henchmen Febre (Tim Roth). Febre is the same villain who killed D'Artagnan's parents, and his blind eye is a direct result of an injury inflicted upon him by D'Artagnan as a boy. D'Artagnan manages to persuade some ex-musketeers to rise up and fight back against the political plotters controlling the country. Eventually, Febre becomes so drunk with power and bloodlust that even Cardinal Richlieu realises that he cannot control him, so he asks D'Artagnan and the musketeers to stop him. With the life of the Queen (Catherine Deneuve) and a young chambermaid (Mena Suvari) at stake, D'Artagnan attempts one last desperate bid to destroy Febre in his lair.The cast is an impressive one Rea, Deneuve, Castaldi, Suvari - plus other faces like Nick Moran and Michael Byrne - are all established actors with a good body of work in their back catalogue. Alas, they are almost entirely wasted here - Gene Quinatno's hopelessly muddled script gives them nothing to do, since it's only interested in filling the gaps in as cursory a manner as possible between the action set-pieces. Only Roth does anything remotely three-dimensional with his character. It's peculiarly hard to follow what's going on much of the time, since all scenes involving exchanges of dialogue are clumsily fumbled. The fight choreography is at least pretty good, even if it does look rather amiss in a period swashbuckler like this. The climax, involving an elaborate series of stunts on ladders, is the highlight. Overall, though, The Musketeer is one big, unwieldy mess which never catches fire as a piece of entertainment.

The fact the fight scenes are kung fu with swords is okay. Gene Kelly as an athletic D'Artagnan back in the great days of Hollywood established one template; Richard Lester's two Three Musketeer films with Michael York as D'Artagnan established another, witty, historically accurate template.

The movie wasn't supposed to be Dumas' story made into a movie, but rather another story that his inspired.  This story isn't the three musketeer, but rather one musketeer who has a different story to his life.  The movie was good. Granted the acting was not the best, and there wasn't much of a story to it, but you have to give the movie credit at least in the choreography.  These were some of the best stunts I have seen in a movie that was placed in historical western Europe.  The Matrix and Crouching Tiger had magnificent choreography, but in the movie they wanted you to know that they were martial arts experts.  The beauty of this movie is that western Europe did not have a fighting style like the oriental martial arts, so the merging of European weapons and genre with an oriental style of fighting made the fighting scenes in this movie excellent.  Think of just 5 years ago, back in 1997, before the Matrix was made.  There weren't fighting styles much like this outside of kung fu movies but now everyone is doing it.  So when someone mixes eastern and western fighting styles, they think it's horrible because it's not the norm, or how they actually fought back then.  What I say is that it's a movie, and that's what this movie was made for, people who go to movies for the sake of movies, not for the historical accuracy or if the fighting is not historically correct.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie because it was not the norm.  I enjoyed it cause I was tired of seeing D'Artagnan in the other musketeer movies being such a goody goody.  This movie was made to be not the normal musketeer movie, and they did an excellent job at doing so.  But it seems that some people cannot accept this fact, or accept different derivities from the classic.  This movie wasn't made to be Alexandre Dumas book made into a movie.

Tim Roth will never make a bad villain, and the guy who played Cardinal Richelieu was thoroughly enjoyable too.Okay, that said...The character development is the real problem here. Athos, Porthos and Aramis never did anything cool that the rest of the corps didn't do. There was no reason to care about the old dude that died in the fire. Mena Suvari was just an artificial media construct, a strong-willed woman with no development, nothing leading up to the meaningful events making me appreciate why she was the way she was. So she was just a hot young female body plunked into the middle of the film.Acting all-around, was okay. But...The one big sin about character development that is unforgivable, in my opinion, is that d'Artagnan was a big badass from the minute the 14 years later... fades from the screen. This is why Alexandre Dumas novels are not martial arts movies. d'Artagnan is the inspiration for Luke Skywalker. He should start out as an awkward youth, knocking things over, stuttering, stammering, looking like a future shish kabob. The audience should be surprised by his development into a skilled, worthy musketeer. Michael York did this beautifully. Even Chris O'Donnell offered something here, and he can't act nearly as well as Justin Chambers. But NOOO...we've got Xing-Xing Grand-High Whatzisface doing the choreography here...so everyone's gotta be a friggin' Jedi Super-master from the get-go.It kills the story. It's a disaster, because it's settled early on that everyone who swashbuckles in this movie, is going to swashbuckle just as well or just as poorly as the choreographer and director want them to, and duels will be fought and won and lost to the convenience of the story. The audience's perceptions are relegated to insignificance.THEN they COMPOUNDED it.

It is like the A-Team because there are a lot of harmful things flying through the air and only a few people if that many are/were seriously hurt, damaged, killed, or showed signs of the consequences of the violence. The action in this movie is merely filmed as eye candy or to look pretty for the camera or the audience. Don't get me wrong I like action and violent films. The second problem I had with this movie was the script, it seems everyone is along for the paycheck and for a ride. To add to this, there is little or no character development, they are basically one dimensional characters even the leads are poorly written. A third problem is the lack of character development of the other Musketeers, frankly I was a little disappointed by how little they were in the story and how little their characters were developed. the forth problem I had with this movie was the cinematography and action choreography. I like most Peter Hyams films especially The Relic, but this movie and the End of Days have not exactually been great movies not even good movies. Then there is the action choreographer Xin Xin Xiong, Jackie Chan and Jet Li called they want their props back. It is truly amazing how many props there could be for a movie set during the 1600 to 1700's. There are some good things about this movie. The first good thing about this movie would be that because of Peter Hyams direction some of the action scenes look pretty good. The second positive thing about this movie is that the actors do a good job with what they have to work despite the poor story and script. The third thing is the always beautiful actress Mena Suvari. This movie did not totally suck, mainly because Man in the Iron Mask was worse. I give this movie *&1/2 stars or a C-. Thanks for your time and attention.

Half the time people will pick one thing they hated about a movie and forget to enjoy the movie in their quest to make themselves feel better.That having been said, I will not watch this movie again.  The trailer was excellent, making me want to watch the movie.  It was the only riveting thing about the movie.  None of the characters were memorable, and none of them evoked any emotion whatsoever from me.  The editing was terrible, and I could never tell if something I saw was going to hold true in the next second or not.  Enough has been said about the lighting, so I will simply focus on the editing and the story.The story contorts badly to try to maintain a plot.  I can find no reason why, in the first scene, the villain rides off after being hit in the eye instead of ordering his men to slaughter the boy, or even doing it himself. This is forgivable only in that it is intended to start the story, however, I would have had the villain send men after the boy only to run into the old man.  The first scene after the hero is 'grown' with the boy stealing seemed very contrived and unbelievable.  It seemed to serve only as proof that he can now take care of himself and serves no purpose whatsoever in furthering the plot.  Later, when they have the queen and are being chased, the hero drops black powder onto a tiny bridge to stop the villain.  If the intent were to blow up the bridge, it certainly isn't portrayed as believable, since any horse could easily jump the tiny ruined bridge.  If the intent were to create fire that they can't run through, black powder burns quickly and turns into carbon almost instantly, creating a flare-up for maybe 5 seconds at the most, certainly not enough to make the villain turn around. Near the end, when the hero is about to assault the castle by himself and his friends ride up, including the old man in the carriage with the hero's horse tied to the rear, the director actually allows you to watch an entire scene of him talking to his horse where the hero is already wearing the tabard of the musketeers before it's even given to him in the very next scene.  Then, while on the ropes, not only do you watch the travesty that is the climbing scene, but you can visibly see the hero drop his sword, only to be carrying it the very next scene.  After he gets to the top, the love interest is shot, only to whisper to the hero that she is alright, and from the appearance of the dress, it's as if she's wearing some sort of bullet-proof vest, which is the only assumption, as she appears later completely unharmed.  The final hero vs. villain scene is horrible as well, not only is the fight scene stolen from a fight scene in 'Once Upon A Time In China', it is hashed up and abruptly stopped.  One minute the hero is at the bottom of the ladder, and the villain is coming down after him, and the next the hero is standing underneath the villain looking at him, and the villain is dead.  No death scene, and no hint, other than the obvious fact he was impaled on some sort of sharp object, is given.  This scene served as the deathblow to a poorly done climax.  Alone, these are little things, but you add them up and it goes from being a good story to not even good entertainment value.

It's one of those guilty pleasures, the wannabe blockbusters with a bad script, worse actors and cheese written all over it, which flop disastrously at the box office and get rented out about once a year from your local video store. However, if you correctly anticipate the film as one of this kind, and expect nothing more, then you'll be more than pleased with it. Yup, the script is pretty dire. The story is nothing if not formulaic, and the acting is wooden from the entire cast apart from Tim Roth, who does a decent baddie. There's a big climactic fight scene, the heroes win, d'Artagnan gets the girl and everyone goes home in time for tea. It's a recipe for a turkey, but surprisingly the trimmings taste very good indeed. For starters there's a lively, brash score à la Superman, great costumes all around, authentic-looking sets and very nice production design.  Secondly the action is intense - the fight scenes are quite amazing, on a par with things like The Matrix and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Some of the fights even have a comedic Jackie-Chan-type element to them which is very well done. It's a shame, because the film could have done a lot better than it did, and it seems like they ran into some problems while making it - it feels like it was intended to be a grandiose two or two and a half hour epic, but had to be brutally edited down to under two hours for some financial or contractual reason. There are lots of scenes which have noticeable chunks hacked out of them, leading to minor plot holes and a sense of discontinuity. Casting was also a problem area, with French, English and American actors sounding very French, English and American, and quite inappropriate alongside each other. Inexperienced crew, or money problems, or something else? I don't know, but D'Artagnan deserves better. It deserves to be a cult flop like Starship Troopers or Waterworld. At least that's what I think, so don't blame me if you're not included in this particular cult.

Sadly, that has been proven not to be the case.XXX's wire-fu acrobatics are poorly suited for this kind of swordplay, and as one who greatly appreciates fencing as the Science of Kings, I have to say it would have been nice if this film had any.  At all.The Musketeer is shot so dark, so murky, so impossibly moody that there is nearly no swordplay visible--and what little IS visible is lost among swirling capes, teetering ladders, and and apparently cross-eyed opponents.  And not in a ooh, cool kind of way, either.  I say cross-eyed because it's nearly the only thing that explains how five men with swords can miss one with only one--and he spread-eagled between beams on the ceiling of a bar.

However, some attributes are going to carry over no matter what you do with the rest of the story line.In this movie I got no sense that the character of D'Artagnan ever really got it through his head that he was striving to become part of something larger than himself. He was bent on revenge, and becoming a Musketeer would help in that quest. Sure, he used  mottos and principles of the Musketeers to shame them...into helping HIM. They performed as one, doing their duty, while he went about his quest. Even at the end, now fully a Musketeer, his last words to Richelieu are not those of someone who is part of a greater good, but simply mano y mano, if I may be allowed a cross-cultural reference.(I don't analyze every film this way. Some just happen to strike a chord. I like to go to movies for pure fun, and I was prepared to let this one stand on its own merits.

But he showed none of the villainous charisma that he laid on in Planet of the Apes as General Thade.  He showed up, read his lines through an eye patch, and cashed in at the bank.

The long and short of it is 1700's France, D'Artagnan's(Justin Chambers ) father is killed by Febre (Tim Roth), D'Artagnan  vows to grow up and become a Musketeer, elite body guards of the King, just like his father.  He grows up, becomes a kick butt swordsman, and sets out to join the Musketeers only to find they have been disbanded by the not so religious Cardinal Richeleu who plots to deface the king in order to seize the throne.  Still with me?  Good.  D'Artagnan joins up with Musketeers Athos (Jan Gregor Kremp), and Porthos (Steven Spiers) to save the day.  Weren't there three musketeers you ask?  I thought so too but since the two that are in this movie are completely wasted why bother having the third. Now that the niceties are out of the way, down to business.  This movie sucked.

Now in this day and age of computer magic people can make some pretty spectacular things on the big screen.  I would have settled for a guy standing there with handwritten credits on poster board.  The titles looked like they were ripped from some 80's B.B.C. special.  Sadly it was all down hill from there.  Who ever thought that pretty boy model Justin Chambers was an actor?  Boy did you make a mistake. The guy basically read the script from queue cards and put no 'acting' into it.  Mina Suvari is almost no better.  There was absolutely no chemistry between them.  All the dialogue in this movie is horrible.  The action scenes touted so highly in the trailer (the main reason I wanted to see this movie) were dark, to close and horribly blurry.  I couldn't tell what was going on.  You always had the impression that something cool was happening but you could never see it.  Bad guys who give up way to easily, 'Oh no that coach is at least 10 feet away from me and moving slowly no way am I going to try and run after that', or the best was the 5 second fire on the stone bridge that scared away the pursuing baddies, you'd think they were unionized or something.  There are glaring continuity errors, blurry shots and just plan movie badness.  One of the worst had to be near the end when someone (No I won't tell you who) takes a bullet to the chest at close range and not only doesn't die but is back in perfect health for the next scene. The real shame of this movie is that real actors like Tim Roth and Catherine Deneuve got roped into it.  I mean who let's these movies get made, honestly.  What corporate goon read this script and thought it was any good. And who green lighted these actors.  Bah!  Don't go see this under ANY circumstances, even if someone else is paying.Just a note, I'm really not a movie ogre.  I don't hate everything I see.

It appealed to me on the level that someone might gleefully admit to liking something the likes of The Beach or even (UGH!) Lost in Space. Overall the Peter Hyams direction was more directed at the eye instead of the brain, Xin Xin Xong's choreogrophy was great minus the fight scene at the end which I still get a weird kind of Once Upon a Time in China vibe off of. The actors all seem to be having a fun good ole time dressing up in costumes and playing with sharp pointy weapons ( Minus Justin Chambers who actually made me appreciate what Chris O'donnel brought to the role in the 93 film, and Mena Suvari who can look pouty and cute all she wants its all for nothing if you don't emote. Speaking of which the both of them seem to be reading directly from the script instead of acting.) Thats just some of the stuff I liked. What I hated was Gene Quintano's awful script. Dialouge falls out sounding at times like its in another one of his Police Academy movies while the whole plot of kill the Queen and Lord Buckingham seems to want to be just a sidepoint. Now I know they probably wanted to create something the likes of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or even The Swordsman series. But those are martial arts films based on martial arts novels (forgive me if I've made a mistake in that quote since it is quiet impossible to find either of those books in America.) The Three Musketeers isn't meant to be some silly Martial Arts swordfighting flick, however much you rape it for the movie. It wasn't written by a man who thought to himself Oh god I hope they get Ching-Siung Tung to direct! I emplore Hollywood stop raping Dumas. Make something original like you used to do.

Here was Tim Roth, who was quite good and probably the best in the entire film, playing another villain with a sword and about the same flare as he did in Rob Roy. I was pretty happy to see that. However the momentary joy was just that. I heard comments coming out of the theater to the effect people were wondering if the actors were reading off of cue cards.The poor acting, and line delivery, aside from Tim's, was atrocious. It started out tolerable then just degenerated to the end until they were using fractional sentences and small words for main lines. I would like to give them the benefit of the doubt and try to believe the script was either wrote intentionally for easy translation or was translated poorly and directed poorly for the english version, but find it highly doubtful.The sets were very authentic looking with a one glaring detraction mentioned later. The costuming seemed very good. The locales filmed appeared right for the picture. I did not detect any out of place modern profanity. Profanity is just fine by me if it is in place with the picture, but modern cursing in a classic epic is a just blaise.The action sequences were exciting and comical at the same time leaving a less than mediocre feeling. The first big sequence was in a bar (also depicted in the trailors). Things were going great until the principle lept up to the rafters and was twirling around. This rose my suspicions. The action sequences just kept going over the top after that - completely out of context with that era's european fighting styles....however, much was in context with oriental fighting styles as depicted in popular gung-fu movies. Lots of spinning of the body and equipment paired with fantastical gymnastics. A lot of obvious, over-the-top wire work.The bloopers were many. Watch for modern distance measurement, modern paved roads with striping in the background, sword fights with clear blows and enough force to bend the blade (blows that should have been lethal if it were real or by appearances), and what I'm going to label the infamous, self balancing ladder.The last Musketeer film released was a mild version with Chris O'Connell, Kiefer Sutherland, Charlie Sheen, etc. That was pretty good. With the more realistic, grittier scenery and what I saw of the trailer I had high hopes this would be a great retelling of the famous tale of high adventure with all the elements of deceit, treachery, service and honor.

My first thoughts were that it really is scandalous that the studios actually advertised this film to make the movie-goer believe that it might actually be worth the time and money to go see it. Then, I regretted that it wasn't just a couple members of my family that were conned into seeing it, but that there were actually six of us there to writhe in misery, all of us praying for the credits to roll. There are really more horrible things to say about this movie than I have the time to write.

You just don't try to update a classic like The Three Musketeers without a decent script and good acting.I knew I was in for it when the credits began, and Justin Chambers, who portrays the title character, isn't one of the first three people listed as being in the cast; he even has And before his name, like Jerry Mathers on Leave it to Beaver. Athos, Porthos, and Aramis (The Three Musketeers for the uninitiated) are reduced to uninteresting tagalongs for Chambers' arrogant D'Artagnan to play off of and occasionally embarrass.The action scenes were much better the first time I saw them. (See Once Upon a Time in China for how that ladder finale was supposed to look, and Stagecoach instead of that entire carriage sequence.) There are even two scenes that infer that Francesca (Mena Suvari's character) is being sexually abused by her father, but why anyone thought it would be a good addition to the story is beyond my comprehension, and it's treated so insignificantly as to almost be insulting. It doesn't provide depth for the characters it's just sensationalistic and pointless.Of course, everyone ends up upstaged by Tim Roth his character's evil schemes approach Bond-villain magnitude in both scope and (poor) execution. It's anyone's guess why they transplanted Dumas' Rochefort character into a brand new character named Febre (Roth) and put Rochefort in the movie at all, but they did. Like every other character in the film, Febre is flat and one-sided, but it's entertaining to see Roth acting so despicably evil. I was actually hoping to see him do more of the evil things he threatens to, just because he deserved more screen time. It's hard enough to root for such a dull and uninteresting hero (as D'Artagnan ends up being in this version), but with Roth as his nemesis, it's nearly impossible to care for him much at all.If you'd really like to see a good Three Musketeers movie, check out The Man in the Iron Mask with Byrne, Malkovich, Irons, Depardieu, and DiCaprio. They don't do splits on barrels or crawl under carriages, but in the end, the script and acting will make up for anything you think you might be missing. It might not be the story as you've never seen it before, but it's much more entertaining.

Shake, stir, and pour out onto celluloid.  Add in the fight scenes you've hyped up, and expect that to satisfy the viewers.Not for one instant did I forget I was watching a film.  I didn't care about the characters.  I did, however, wonder why guards turned and went home at small inconveniences; I wondered how much worse the dialogue could get. I wondered how they could turn the rash but believable D'Artangen of literature had into a combination of MacGuiver and John McClane.  Above all, I wondered why I wasted my money.An attempt to take the swashbuckler genre to a new fighting level may be a worthwhile effort.

I loved the previews and was so very psyched to see a unique take on the Musketeers story. Unfortunately the editor for the trailers was so much more highly skilled than the one for the movie. The fight choreography was great and I did enjoy many of the fight scenes, though I am growing rather tired of the over-exaggerated environments in which they tend to take place. For instance, a fight scene amidst a room full of ladders served only to show how good with navigating a tenuous arrangement of ladders that the characters can be. It did nothing to display an actual fight, to showcase the talent of what are supposedly the two greatest fighters in the movie's universe.Mena Suvari was little better than robotic and the filming was simply terrible. The shots and quality of film reminded me of some of the worse examples of made-for-tv movies out there. Obviously historical accuracy wasn't in the best interests of the filmmakers either as several scenes showed Explosive shell cannons. A technology that didn't come along in Europe for another few hundred years.To cap it all off. There was one of the biggest editing mistakes I've ever seen in my life. If anyone still wants to see this movie after this review then keep your eyes peeled near the end when D'Artagnan is about to storm the castle. He is wearing a brown duster of sorts and then his friends come to help and all of a sudden he is wearing a blue Musketeers uniform. Next shot he is wearing the brown duster again and someone throws him the blue Musketeers uniform that he was wearing only moments before. WHAT THE HELL?How did that ever make it past editing? Past screening even?Oh well, if the people who made the film had quality in mind in the first place then the movie would have actually been decent if not good.My advice is not to go see this movie.

I'm not really sure, because, frankly, I couldn't tell what was going on. The action sequences were all filmed with the camera too tightly focused or zoomed -- it was impossible to get a sense of what was going on between the combatants.

With poor character development, atempts at cheap laughs, and poor acting, The Musketeer is a massacre. This film attemps to mimic a new and popular fighting style that was invented with The Matrix, and mastered in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. These movements are unrealistic, but can be turned into something that is incredible to view, or just be simply beautiful. The Musketeer however, does not put either one of these to use, for the fighting is neither incredible or beautiful, it's just bad. One of the things that drew me to this film was that i saw Tim Roth's name in the credits. One of my favorite actors, Roth is a professional at playing the bad guy. Whenever i refer to a well-done evil-doer, Roth's performance in Rob Roy is the first one that comes to mind. His character could not have been done more perfectly, and i hoped for more of the same perfection in this film, but even Roth missed, which is something that surprised me emmensley. Much like the protagonist we meet in The Patriot, Roth's bad guy is WAY overdone, and the evil we see in him is unbelievable. We see Justin Chambers in his first starring role as D'artangan, the wanna be musketeer. I had hoped to be introduced to a new and talented young actor in Chambers, but again, i was disappointed. Even the new heart-throb Heath Ledger would have fit into this role better, because Chambers struggled throughout.

The three musketeers, Porthos, Athos and Aramis are reduced to being caricatures and I found M. Justin Chambers most unconvincing as D'Artagnan.  Catherine Deneuve, always gorgeous, seems out of place in this film but keep up a brave front in spite of some ghastly lines and situations. All and all, I would guess, if you are young, romantically inclined and not to familiar or caring about the original Dumas story, you'll like the action and scenes with two young, pretty protagonists in romantic interludes.

First of all, when are filmmakers going to learn that not everyone in Europe has a British accent? I mean the French in this movie sounded more English than the British duke did. The movie had many, many plot errors and mistakes. For example, during the scene where he is climbing up the tower (as seen in the previews), why should the enemies repel down to fight him? I would just wait for him to get up there and death! Also, the role of the other musketeers in this movie was pretty lean. The book was about the four of them together, not one man.Finally, the editing in the fight scenes is really, really bad. Most of the time it is too dark to see anything, and the other times the camera is so jumpy you can't see what is going on.***SPOILER***Well, maybe not, but did anyone notice at the end during the ladder fight that the two actors were so obviously stunt doubles?

Everyone in that movie, including the uber-hottie Mena Suvari, acted like they were getting paid enough money by Miramax to recite their lines, and that's it. As Kevin Smith aptly declared through tongue-in-cheek statements in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, screw a whole lot of Miramax and their horribly declining movies.Tim Roth's eventual (and obvious) death as Febre was not even close to the justice his character deserved.

The opening fight makes you want to believe that at least the impressive action choreography of Xin Xin Xiong will make the film somewhat bearable.  But you soon learn that fancy swordplay cannot redeem this film. The dialogue is horribly trite, there is no character development, and no reason to root for anyone.  The two female leads are depicted as being strong-willed and opinionated in an era where women were expected to be submissive, but one gets the feeling that this was introduced to be politically correct as this character trait really doesn't come into play. The fight scenes (which feature heavily in the trailers and TV spots, so someone knew this would be the film's only saving grace) become less and less impressive as the film progresses, and the final fight scene between D'Artagnan (whose name is mispronounced numerous times throughout the film) and Febre (Roth, horribly wasted as a one-dimensional Snidely Whiplash with a rapier) plays out more like an accident rather than the reckoning for which D'Artagnan has been training most of his life.

If I hadn't been in the theater I would have had a great time making fun of it. The whole plot is ridiculous, absolutely historically inaccurate. Apparently, Richelieu is not really a bad man, he just hired an evil assassin who of course, desperately hates the king. Richelieu himself has a sudden, unprecedented change of heart in the middle of the movie for no apparent reason. The king is a good man who is being screwed over by Richelieu. In reality, Louis XIII was a terrible king; Richelieu played on his weaknesses (there were many) to control the country. If he hadn't, Louis would have ruined France himself; he had no business leading a country.Anyway, Cardinal Richelieu looks constipated throughout, although maybe that's just Richelieu, not the actor. There was NO character development, although they definitely tried hard. Mena Suvari has poor delivery of poorly written lines. She and the beautiful Justin Chambers have little chemistry; their whole romance is absolutely absurd and pitifully boring. My only guess is that they cut some scenes out, it is the only way their relationship makes sense. Mena Suvari's character is probably the worst part of the movie, but it's not really her fault. This is definitely the type of movie that could have benefitted with some lovin.Justin Chambers himself is halfway decent; it's hard to tell because of the terrible dialogue. Tim Roth is great, as usual. The worst part of the movie was the plot. The only thing that carried it was the fight scenes, which were REALLY good. They made the movie watchable.

I have become a fan of historical novels, and I like to encourage new costume melodramas.  The idea of setting a Hong Kong action movie in another country and another time is not an inherently bad idea.  It's just that in this particular instance, it does not work at all. And then again, there are bad movies that, while you are watching them, you can withhold judgement-- if enough stuff is flying at you, you may be lucky enough to be out the theater doors for 10 or 15 minutes before you start to think, You know, that was kind of stupid... The Musketeer, to my sorrow, gives you ample time to compose a running list of That Which Sucketh as you watcheth.  Here are some highlights of my list 1.  Too damn dark.  My dad and other oldtimers complain about that a lot, and I usually defend darkness for artistic cinematic purposes, but most of the interior scenes are too dang dark, goldang it! 2.  The guy who plays Dartagnan is not charismatic and his hat looks stupid. The other 3 musketeers are unremarkable except for fat Porthos, of whom we can only say the fat guy was sort of cool. 3.  The villains look like they would prefer being elsewhere.  Stephen Rea can't even be bothered to paste on his fake mustache correctly, and Tim Roth is the same bad guy he was in Rob Roy, but can't seem to work up that much interest in his love of being Evil. 4.  The fight scenes were sort of okay, but... in a Kung Fu movie, we have come to accept hundreds of angry extras attacking our hero for hinting his Kung Fu is better.  But in another setting, even in France, such behavior seems more than a little rude.5.  The Musketeer features the most obvious Stunt Doubles since Captain Kirk's double kicked around styrofoam boulders on StarTrek.  I don't want to say that Asian movies have an advantage at faking with doubles because all those guys look alike... because, dammit, they don't, it is always very apparent that Jackie Chan is fighting as Jackie Chan.  Here, we got a couple stocky dudes fighting with glued on mustachios that won't even fool an Asian audience that might think WE all look alike. And there is much much more to complain of.  Riding a horse into the ground and apologizing to it and sending a pal to pick it up later, as if it could possibly still be alive... the same stupid spear point shoving into the same exact spot of a carriage to get the same oh my goodness reaction from the queen, at least 3 times in a row...  the secret cannons in the carraige that fire without ripping themselves from their mountings or sending the carriage shooting back from the recoil... But negative reviews are so easy to write, I should try to find something good to say... the sets were very good, the costumes were great except for one or two hats.  And I suppose the lack of blood from any swordslashes would be a plus if you want to take your 5 year old to see it.To sum up, this movie is not worth seeing in the theater (although the audience I saw it with did seem to respond positively-- which says something right there) and it will not be much worth renting, but should be just fine cut up on TNT in a year or two.

I suppose I'll start with the synopsis. That's harmless enough. The Musketeer opens up on a young D'Artagnan (Justin Chambers, The Wedding Planner) in 17th century France, as he witnesses the unprovoked murder of his parents at the hands of the villainous Febre (Tim Roth, Planet of the Apes), over unpaid taxes. Even back then, taxmen were vilified. At least now all they can do is audit you. Little D'Artagnan is a spunky boy, and he tries to fight back but all he manages is a sword-slash to Febre's left eye. No matter that the weapon probably weighed more than he did. For some reason, the merciless, heartless tax-collector-cum-killer lets the little boy live. (Which turns out to be a big mistake, if you hadn't guessed.) D'Artagnan grows up with an unspecified mentor who teaches him the way of the sword as they travel across the land, looking either for Febre, or other musketeers so D'Artagnan can join up. I'm not sure which is the quest, but at any rate, they find both. The Three Musketeers, Aramis, Athos and Porthos (Nick Moran, Jan Gregor Kremp, and Steve Speirs, respectively), who have peripheral roles here at best, are portrayed as one-dimensional bumblers. Febre, who hasn't aged a day in lo these many years, is as cartoony-cruel as ever. Nowadays, he's hooked up with the unscrupulous, greedy Cardinal Richelieu  (Stephen Rea, The End of the Affair) and they're out to overthrow the King. Enter the Musketeers. As they clang sword tips together and proclaim, All for one! One for all! you can imagine the phrase being delivered without the exclamation points. Collectively, they possess about as much passion as a parking meter. Along the way, D'Artagnan falls in love with a feisty peasant girl, Francesca, portrayed by Mena Suvari (American Pie 2) with as much sass and flash as a department store mannequin. She delivers her lines as though she thought she was memorizing the script for something that might have been called American Musketeer 2. She really needs to stick to films with the word American in the title, I think. Although there is absolutely no spark between the two young lovers onscreen, perhaps they are well-matched. Chambers is just as white-bread bland, and obviously miscast, as Suvari is. There's the requisite oops-I-saw-you-naked scene early on in the movie. And then. there's another one! Then, of course they make love. And, again of course, while practically en flagrato, the maiden winds up in the clutches of the dastardly Febre, who has also kidnapped the Queen (Catherine Deneuve, Dancer in the Dark). Deneuve and Rea are the only actors worth watching in this whole debacle. That is, if you could see them. Director/cinematographer Peter Hyams (End of Days) has made this film so dark and drab, at first I thought I was watching a work print. I'm not opposed to artistic inkyness or black used as negative space, but there is just no excuse for what's on the screen here. The color balance is way off, and most of the fight scenes are shot so claustrophobically you can hardly tell who's who (which the actors probably preferred; the less face-time the better). In addition to the poor cinematography and dull, dull direction, the egregiously loud soundtrack, with decibel-levels to rival an AC/DC vs. Motorhead concert, is strictly standard fare. The Musketeer tries for a few laughs here and there, but it appears Hyams really couldn't decide what he wanted to do in regards to this. In one especially disastrously directed scene, D'Artagnan must abandon his spent steed, who has carried him at full gallop across the countryside to rescue the Queen and his lady love. The horse sinks down to the ground, heaving with exhaustion. D'Artagnan, leaving the poor creature in full saddle and bridle, vows to return for him as he dashes off. I think this was meant to be serious moment between man and trusty beast, but the screening audience was laughing all through it. (And by the way, D'Artagnan broke his promise. He should be horse-whipped for that!) Much has been made of Xin-Xin Xiong choreographing the fight scenes for The Musketeer, and when one goes to see a swashbuckler, one excepts a lot of sword play. You do get a lot here. Too much. After 19 sword fights, the big, climactic showdown at the end is minimized.  Still, Xiong's choreography shines -- as the Musketeer swings from long ropes suspended on the side of a tower, and teeters on the end of long ladders (how lucky the castle was being renovated at that moment!), he cuts an almost-dashing figure. Still, he's no Errol Flynn (or even Jackie Chan). I was looking forward to the action in this movie, and came away very disappointed (not to mention bored). Hyams has stressed in interviews that despite the hiring of an Asian fight choreographer, he purposely stayed away from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon/Matrix-like tricks. Since the movie's lead actors didn't stay in the traditional French mode anyway, and since the dialogue doesn't even try for authenticity, why not go for some Far Eastern-embellished, stylized swashbuckling? It wouldn't have saved the movie, but if definitely would have helped. The tagline for The Musketeer reads, As you've never seen it before. Might I add, And hope to never see again? If there's ever a remake (or a reimagining, if Tim Burton has anything to do with it) of A Clockwork Orange, I think the manic-movie scene should feature The Musketeer up there on the big screen of torment. <<I noticed that IMDb suggests if you liked Fight Club, you'd like The Musketeer... no way! The two movies are as different as chalk to cheese>> "},{"Title":"Better than other re-makes!","Date":"5 September 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Romance","Review":"    ***SLIGHT SPOILERS*** I saw The Musketeer Tuesday night at Mazza Gallerie in Washington D.C. and I saw this movie back in March at a test screening at a theatre in Sterling, Virginia and my thoughts then were if Universal doesn't touch this print and get the marketing right, they will make money off it.The plot is quite simple and of course is based on the Alexander Dumas' book - D'Artagnan (Justin Chambers) wants to avenge the death of his parents by becoming a musketeer and killing the man that kills his parents.  The opening credits involve a bit of background on how the musketeers came about.  The movie starts as D'Artagnan as a young child simply waiting to eat dinner with his folks when Febre (Tim Roth) and his army comes along looking for taxes to be paid.  Arguing comes about, and the parents are killed.Fourteen years later, D'Artagnan has grown up and the quest begins to become a musketeer.  He meets up with three other musketeers, they test D'Artagnan out to see if he is good, they find out how good he is really is.  He works through numerous battles, ending up in a hotel where he meets Francesca (Mena Suvari) in which he flirts with her.  Francesca works at the hotel as a maid.Without spoiling anything else, the stunts are very well done although some of them are far-fetched.  Comparing this print from the March print I saw, it appeared nothing was touched except the opening credits.  The length was exactly the same, 97 minutes.  When I saw this back in March, the audience was mostly high schoolers, and at the time, because I got there so early, I was picked as part of a focus group afterwards.  What was stated then was some of the kids were being technical with the storyline (I guess they read the book one too many times) but overall enjoyed it.  I thought the music was very well done, and they kept that in the print I saw Tuesday night. The director was there that night, never was introduced, but he heard everything that was stated in the group.  It appeared to me he listened, and didn't do anything major that would ruin the movie.  If there were things cut, I didn't notice.  This is one of the better movies of the year, and I thought that in March and my opinion has not changed.   9.5 out of 10.

In this 'version', D'artagnan must avenge the murder of his parents by Cardinal Richelieu's assassins. Unlike in the Dumas book, in which the cardinal is a crafty unscrupulous politician, here the cardinal and the church represent evil on earth. The well worn pattern is Bad Guy and Good Guy meet; Bad Guy perpetrates outrage on handy nearby helpless innocent; Good Guy beats the crap out of the Bad Guy; Good Guy moves on to next encounter. Oh, yeah, and it is set in France instead of China.D'artagnan doesn't actually say, My name is Diego Montoya - You killed my father - Prepare to die, but that is certainly what he is thinking. And of course he is trained by a wise old itinerant philosopher/sword master who has an affectionate nickname for D'artagnan (I think it is French for grasshopper).I didn't make it through to the end, but I was sort of hoping for a big fight at the end between D'artagnan and the Cardinal himself in flowing red robes, holding a sword in each hand and breathing fire. I can imagine them leaping high though the enormous space of Notre Dame Cathedral, crashing into and out of the huge stain glass windows, smashing up all the artwork along the way until D'Artagnan skewers Richelieu on the high altar with some relic. Then, with blood pouring from his mouth, Richelieu gasps out some secret, like I am your father, or I'd walk a mile for Camel, or I am a woman in disguise. But maybe they are saving that for the sequel.

With countless adaptations made over the years, legendary actors like Oliver Reed, Christopher Lee, Charlton Heston and Michael York have all featured in these classical tales. Based on an inaccurate history by Alexandre Dumas, everyone has a version and a character that they like the most.As a result of the story's success therefore, we are still receiving modern adaptations in the 21st century. In 2001, with martial arts stunts and a mediocre cast, this French/American collaboration, entitled either The Musketeer or D'Artagnan depending on your country, is mostly dreadful, but with the saving grace that is Tim Roth.After witnessing the murder of his parents, young D'Artagnan (Justin Chambers) is raised by his old friend Planchet (Jean-Pierre Castaldi). Becoming the finest swordsman in France, D'Artagnan tries to follow in his fathers footsteps by becoming a King's Musketeer. Times are not good for these heroes though, with their leader Treville (Michael Byrne) imprisoned and the evil Febre (Tim Roth) out for blood.From the opening musical sequence The Musketeer smacks of awkwardness. With a script and a set up which would be more at home in the 1940s, it attempts to redeem itself with lavish fight scenes. It never really settles into a decent routine, mainly due to a script which feels like it was written by a child. With some lines so bad, it is too embarrassing to repeat, the script crashes and burns without a hint of reprieve.The fights as well, whilst incredibly clever to set up and film, never really feel like they belong. Reminiscent of traditionally Chinese films, these fights just don't feel realistic and they are often excessive. The final major battle involving an enormous fight and a small hero vs bad-guy encounter, is drawn out to it's excesses and is ridiculous to watch.Truth be told, this film would probably be up there amongst the worst films ever if it wasn't for the one wonderful aspect which is Tim Roth's appearance.Roth, looking like a homeless dog in desperate need of a grooming, is wonderful throughout. Not helped by the dire script, he casts a perpetually evil glance over the entire film. He struts around with a badly made eye-patch on, and he manages to pull the part off. He has one or two scenes of pure evil which he makes work, not because the script is remotely decent, but because he speaks his lines with a sense of maliciousness and smoothness. Roth gets a badly scripted character, he DOES overact, but he somehow manages to make it work. He is the one highlight in an otherwise dire film.For not the first time, and definitely not the last, a film with little going for it, is released. Loosely based on a work by one of France's greatest writers, The Musketeer is a woeful encounter which is only saved by an excellent performance by Tim Roth. The film is worth watching ultimately for Roth, and Roth alone.

This very well may be the best part of the film, so if you walk in on it during the opening credits, it might be wise to abandon it and see it some other time (it's a pre-credits sequence). The Musketeer has a realistic look and feel to it, which I was very happy to see, even though there are times when a support cable or wire might pop in as an extra. There is even an airplane in one shot (don't worry, it's more than 30,000 feet away). Even though there are multiple appearances by support equipment, I was still happy with the overall look and feel. That's rare for me, as I am very detail oriented. Another strong point of this film was the absence (or near absence) of blood. To be able to tell a story such as this, get the message across well, and have very little blood flow speaks for itself.The weak point of this film. Yes, there is a weak point, and it's a strong enough weak point to make people wonder if they liked the movie or not. The action sequence editing...   ...most notably the fight scenes. I can guess that the fight scene choreography was very good, but that's as close as I can get because I don't think I saw much fighting. It seemed to be mostly implied. I truly believe that the editors took all of the fight scene footage, put it in a food-processor, and made an attempt to splice it together somehow...  ...in the dark. Those scenes are hard to follow and really confusing as to what's going on. If they were treated this way to avoid looking too violent, then there is a better way to do that. Some of the shots really resembled cutting room floor shots. What I mean by this is there would be a shot of some guys sword fighting, everyone is anonymous, and it's a close-up of their legs.  ???? What's that about? The scenes seemed to constantly hint that something cool just happened but it was something that we didn't see. Although I liked this movie, I would warn potential viewers of it about the fight-scene editing (As I am attempting to do now), and of the characters getting really lightweight during those same fight scenes.

In spades.About the only thing this movie and the book have in common is the title.

At first I thought something is wrong with my DVD setup, but then I realized not. The credits actually look like a high school presentation.Then comes the first scene. Young D is sitting having breakfast or lunch or dinner with his parents. You can't really tell what part of the day it is, because the lightning is so messed up. His father is a big fat peasanty man, his mother looks like a peasant who just got out of the tub, smiling and freshy. At this point I thought the movie is going to turn into a Cheerios advertisement. But no, evil riders arrive, and after a short exchange they kill the parents. Young D swears he's going to kill'em all (he's only like 8 years old).Next scene, D is already 24. He goes into a pub type place, and some obviously evil guys start picking on him, there is a short exchange, but they don't start a fight. Then some bambi eyed bum looking kid tries taking a rotten piece of bread from the table, and of course the evil guys immediately want to beat/kill/gangrape him, but young D comes to the rescue. At this point a totally unnecessary matrixy fight scene starts. Of course it's not the original D actor anymore, so the lights are turned down, and funny camera angles are used, so you can't see the characters faces, or anything else. About ten seconds in the fighting you can tell that D has already reached superhero levels - he practically flies through the room like superman and sticks to the ceiling like spiderman. This works in the Matrix (1), but there you see Neo getting stronger and stronger, so you're always wondering what he'll do next. But not here. D has already learned how to manipulate the matrix and can beat any agent.At this point you start wondering why you should watch the movie. (A) you already know the story (B) the fight scenes will be boringBut anyways, you decide to watch further. In the next scenes the musketeers are introduced. These guys are fat, they constantly drink - they are not Dumas' man of honor. Also, whenever the good guys decide to do something (like rescue a queen), it's always D who comes up with the idea. The musketeers are just like the peasant hordes in Braveheart. And in fight scenes, the musketeers never do matrixy stuff - it's always just D doing the backflips and high kicks. They just do the standard my-sword-hits-your-sword-on-the-right-side-and-now-my-sword-hits-your-sword- on-the-left-side-AND-again stuff. Incredibly stupid.About ten minutes into the movie D meets a good-looking girl. The instant the girl is shown on the screen some cheesy-romantic music is played, so you already know the rest they fall in love, maybe even have sex, the girl is going to be kidnapped, but then rescued, and in the end they'll have lots of Cheerios-eating kids. Also, this is the only girl in the movie. There are no others. You'd think maybe there should be an evil girl who wants to seduce D just 'cause she's evil, or whatever, but no. It's just this one girl.At this point the story actually starts. You learn that the king... and the cardinal... and whatever. About halfway into the movie is a really funny part the king and the queen and other important nobles are having a party in a castle. Suddenly, hordes of bummy looking peasants storm the *totally unprotected* castle, and start... well, point is, once inside the castle, these obviously-evil dudes are just running around being evil and causing mayhem. Of course D already knew this is going to happen, so they snuck into the castle to rescue the king & queen. So guess how they go at it? They lead them out through the palace sewers! So there you have the king and queen of France in full party clothing walking through the sewers with thousands of rats. THAT'S STUPID.The last scene I watched before giving up is when D talks to the cardinal. Here we learn D has learned how to teleport through the matrix! He magically appears in the chambers of the cardinal located in his well guarded castle, talk for about two minutes without saying anything, then the latter turns away, and by the time he turns back D has teleported out again.Well, at this point I turned it off. Someone suggested that this movie is like Xena and Hercules; I agree, that's a good way to describe it. It's really stupid.Oh, and the sound on my region 2 DVD was very messed up. The sound gets renormalized (?) in mid-scene you're in the middle of the fighting, it's pretty loud, you can hear the horses, etc.; then n+1th evil imp pulls out a gun, and a split second before he fired it the sound level drops to ~50%; the shot is fired, it doesn't blow your speakers; the sound goes up again. This happens all over the first 50 minutes of the movie, and it's very annoying.I can't believe I've spent $3 on renting this crap.

The editing thus seems incredibly amateur and choppy.- None of the accents make any kind sense, some characters speak English with French accents, some speak with American accents and some speak with COCKNEY accents.- Hyams (doing double duty as director and DP) doesn't employ any kind of superficial light sources, relying solely on ambient lighting of torches, windows, etc. While this may be fine for an intimate drama, documentary or other independent film, it is FATAL for a swashbuckler. Many scenes are dreadfully underexposed, making it virtually impossible to enjoy or even follow many of the fight scenes, which by the way are shamelessly plagiarized from Xiong Xin Xin's previous work. Hyams couldn't light a bloody birthday cake!- David Arnold's excellent score, the film's ONLY saving grace, is mangled in editing and mixed so low that it is reduced to a mere ambience sound.

I was honestly wondering throughout the entire movie whether I had mistakenly walked into an 18th century version of Batman.The musketeer is a very apt name for this movie as there really appears to be only one.  All of the rest are simply bumbling idiots that can barely walk much less draw a sword or think of a plan to save the king.  This movie doesn't even do justice to the character of D'Artagnan, who seems to be a viscious and calculating young man, rather than the naive young man from the novel who is exceptional with a sword and has a farely strong wit.In fact rather than wasting your money renting this one from the movie store, I would rent some of the earlier versions of the book turned movie. The Three Musketeers (1993), although hardly accurate to the book, is comedic and adventurous and altogether a much more enjoyable film.  If you want a movie that both does justice to the book and is still entertaining, then rent the 1973 version of the Three Musketeers.  This at least contains all of te essential elements without ruining any of the characters or the plot.The only constant problem that I see with movies made from the novels of Dumas is that no one bothers to bring in the duality of man which so encompasses both the heros and the villains in his books.  Take my advice, don't rent the movie, just read the book.

I went into it with more of an open mind and thought, would this have been pummeled to this point had our wanna be musketeer been named Jeff?  Personally I noticed no wires and am willing to bet they were digitally erased, I noticed no stunt doubles during fight scenes, but do not doubt they were used, and I thought the darkness to the scenes was probably the most real to life aspect of this film.  Sorry, but natural lighting from a flame is always soft and dark and though we might want to see better what is going on (and it certainly could not have hurt this story), natural flames that light a room to not look like the dark ages usually come in the form of some celestial body.So in defense of the makers of this movie, with a musketeer named Jeff and no preconceived expectations, I found it not magnificent, but pleasurable nonetheless.  Sure it had some cheesy lines.  Sure it had a few ridiculous plot points like my favorite, when Mena Suvari is shot in the chest with some fifty caliber plus lead wad at close range and miraculously is unharmed.  Oh she's knocked off her feet alright, but it must have been the Kevlar vest with steel plate reinforcement she was wearing under her push up bra that saved the day (also not available then).Ah...the perils of evil.

It had real promise with its cast and design. Instead, that film devolved into another one of those messes where Tim Curry becomes a raving lunatic. (Tim Curry and Gary Oldman should together and form a club for typecast psychopathic villains.) So I had hopes for this film.Sometime before I watched it, I heard it was just okay. Some said it stank. I thought that I'd watch it with the expectation that it was going to be sub par.Actually, the film was not nearly as bad as I expected. The fight sequences, casting, cinematography and costuming were all quite remarkable. I especially enjoyed Mena Suvari, Catherine Deneuve and Jean-Pierre Castaldi whenever they were on screen. Some of the one-liners were downright hysterical.And that's where the compliments end. Sadly, the film is plagued with cliches, continuity errors, one or two dreadful plot holes, and a very predictable script. The second half of the film is truly weak at nearly every level. My wife and I were pointing and laughing at the screen because we could not believe that the director would permit the film to get to the MST3K level of ridiculousness.And then, there's Justin Chambers. He reminds me far too much of Chris O'Donnell, who I stopped respecting after Batman and Robin and Vertical Limit. Just one thing, though Chris O'Donnell is *Shakespearean* compared to Chambers! Chambers rolled through his lines like a first year drama student with zero attention to timing or acting. I don't know if that was intentionally done to give the film a fast pace, but it was disconcerting. His chemistry with Suvari is average at its best (she always looks like she would rather kiss a St. Bernard than Chambers), and I found it a little difficult to sympathize with D'Artagnan since he was more than arrogant --- he was annoying.Tim Roth is despicable, as usual. He adds to his villain list that includes Planet of the Apes, Vatel, Pulp Fiction, and Rob Roy with another over-the-top performance. It's just that in his case, I *expect* him to be this outrageous character. He's like Curry and Oldman! But is he the best thing in the film? No, because he can't save it any more that Curry could save The Three Musketeers.If you see it, turn off your brain, and do NOT expect many fight sequences. The movie has very, very few of those.

There was so much wrong with it, anything that went right was dragged down into the abyss of stupidity at the film's center so quickly that I didn't see it.To begin with, the dialogue was just terrible. The characters spoke unrealistically and much of the dialogue was stilted. From the first scene I could tell that this wasn't a film in which the art of speaking was of high importance. The actors portraying French characters spoke with a collection of accents, including French, English and American. Had they limited the selection of accents to simply the French, it would have been nice, but still not nearly enough to save this film.The action scenes, while well choreographed, either didn't fit well in the movie or weren't good enough.

The acting is absolutely horrible, which is worsened even more by the sad attempts at humor and the bad character development.Finally, the fight sequences are nothing to shout praises about, even the ladder fight that was shown in the previews isn't very exciting.

Chambers just doesn't have the leading man qualities at this stage in his career and Mena Suvari turns in another poor performance as a chamber maid who falls for Chambers' character.

I have never met the man, nor would I bask in his company. Yet I would like to ask him one question. The question would be along the lines of, `Why do you continuously make horrible films?'      This Director has made films in the past that have proved to be deplorable, yet he still continues to work in Hollywood. Before a reader mistakes this review for a critical &#145;bashing' of this Director, they are not mistaken. Simply watch the horrendous film that fuses Hong Kong style action with 17th century swordplay and one can determine the result without even viewing this film.       Peter Hyams has directed Jean Claude Van Damme in &#145;Sudden Death' and &#145;TimeCop'. He has also directed Arnold Schwarzenneger in &#145;End of Days'. In his early work, he made &#145;2010' and &#145;The Presidio'. These two films were generally regarded as decent films, yet it is clear that his best days are behind him. &#145;The Musketeer' proves to be one of the worst films ever.     If I possess hatred towards the man, I do not. I respect all Directors. The role of Director is the most respectable and most difficult task of any of the Cinematic tasks. Yet, what I do not respect is when Directors make no attempt at creating a vivid and intriguing film. Clearly such is the case with the misdirected and ultimately devastatingly boring of films with &#145;The Musketeer'.      Hyams' latest debacle stars Justin Chambers (The Wedding Planner) as D'Artagnan; a man hell-bent on joining the Musketeers in order to avenge his parents' death. The classic Alexandre Dumas story has been adapted for the screen many times, yet never in a way that crucifies the script for the sake injecting a new style.       Director Hyams adds an infusion of Hong Kong style to the swashbuckling scenes in hopes of creating an updated Hollywood-ized Eastern version of the great tale. The result &#150; another failure on Peter Hyam's resume.     Not convinced of this film's ridiculousness? View the first half hour of the film and witness for yourself the most badly lit scenes ever captured on film. In broad daylight sequences revolving around indoor discussions, Hyams (who serves as his own Director of Photography) captures his subjects speaking in shadows and dark profiles that seen completely out of place. Simply put, I could not get past this flaw.      By this point, one may have realized the utter wretchedness of the film. I am deeply apologetic because for such a massive production, it is a poor, poor attempt at updating a premise that should be finally left alone.     On another note, I loathe the film and the Director simply because there is no attempt at creating a &#145;fun' film. The film's greatest flaw is that it takes itself too seriously. Notice Hyam's direction, the entire film is shot rarely without any moving camera shots or intense close ups. The discerning viewer may count how many times the camera actually swoops and follows the action on screen. Even thought the fight sequences are choreographed in an outlandish style and could have been somewhat entertaining, Hyams simply sets up his cameras from various angles and lets it roll.      Unfortunately, the film is a horrible attempt at a fresh and inventive spin on a great tale. One last aspect to be noted &#150; the opening credits. They are completely amateur and moody just like Hyam's lighting. In conclusion, save your time and although the 1993 Disney Version was also horrible, it still was a whole lot more enjoyable to watch than this sinful piece of filmmaking.Giancarlo's rating Can you spell G-A-R-B-A-G-E?

The Three Musketeers themselves are a total afterthought, getting little screen time and absolutely zero character set-up or development. They may as well not be in the film at all. As usual, Roth makes a gourmet meal out of store brand ingredients, and Rea and Deneuve do what they can with their undercooked roles.The film's hook was that its action sequences were choreographed by Xin-Xin Xiong, a well known Hong Kong stunt man. Unfortunately it's poorly shot, with much of the action taking place in dimly lit rooms and seemingly edited with a Cuisinart.

But he soon finds that Paris is in turmoil, the royal court is in the grip of the powerful Cardinal Richelieu and the Musketeers have been outlawed ...I am a big fan of Alexandre Dumas' classic 1844 swashbuckler Les Trois Mousquetaires, and I particularly like the fact that almost all the movie versions of it are very good, including this latter-day one. Like all of them, it has its own particular style and in this case it's a big focus on action, with dazzling stuntwork by Xin Xin Xiong and several breathtaking set pieces, most notably an incredible scene where D'Artagnan scales a tall tower on a rope and fights off a bunch of henchmen whilst doing so. The main reason all the versions are good though is that it's just a great tale from start to finish - it's got adventure, intrigue, heroism, goofy antics, great characters, and it's a celebration of a bygone era of French history which is rich and romantic. This film is a looser adaptation than most - it takes out a lot of D'Artagnan's backstory (the purloined letter, the three duels) and replaces it with a childhood revenge plot, and it also removes my favourite character (Milady DeWinter) and replaces her with a villain called Febre who slashes his way through the cast (foe and ally alike) like a seventeenth century Fred Krueger. Roth is maybe a bit too obvious a heavy but he's sinister fun all the same, and the whole cast is good - Deneuve is striking as the Queen, Chambers acquits himself well in the lead, I particularly like Schofield as Rochefort, and Moran and Speirs are a good double act as Aramis and Porthos. It's a shame this movie isn't as well known as some of the previous versions because it really is pretty good, even if not quite as faithful as the others. With great editing by Terry Rawlings (Blade Runner, Goldeneye) and excellent photography by the director, shot in Luxembourg and the Midi-Pyrénées region of France. Dumas' story is timeless (as is his other masterpiece, The Count Of Monte Cristo) and if you haven't seen any of the big-screen adaptations of it then catch this one.

According to renowned indie critic James Berardinelli, Hollywood is making Dumas turn in his grave. Iron Mask was the best and Monte Cristo was the worst. This one has its ups and downs.As odd as it may sound, The Musketeer has the personality of a martial arts picture. You can either choose to see this as a good thing or a bad thing. Ssomehow, it feels a little too over the top and artificial for a 17th century French epic.I may have mentioned once, that Justin Chambers is pretty bad in the lead, but he is no worse than Oliver Platt, Kiefer Sutherland, and Charlie Sheen in the Disney version from ten years earlier. At least Chambers tries to be serious, one could say that he makes Sutherland, Platt and Sheen look like the three stooges in blue tunics.Tim Roth can play good villains, but his performance as the black cloaked, one eyed, captain of the guard, (previously portrayed by Michael Wincott, and Christopher Lee) is not terribly menacing. In truth, none of the acting is especially good. Once again Hyams acts as his own cinematographer, and he is a darn good one. Although not necessarily Oscar worthy, Much of the film is well shot, especially the climax, during which he makes great use of fire to light the hectic fight scenes. As a swashbuckling film, The Musketeer does its job, but not very well. It's occasionally exciting, but often a little too unbelievable. My best recommendation for this kind of material would The Mask of Zorro.

If you were hoping for something a little more in-depth then I suggest you read the actual Dumas book because this movie carters to people like me who want more action and less plot.The stunts are just awesome, the dialogue has its moments, and the actors are well....a nice change from the normal ones you'd expect in movies like this.To sum it up this movie is like Pathfinder...a good time killer.

Suvari does OK, given she's acting across from an actor with the depth of drywall. Her character comes across as a bit feisty and commendable.

This is the freest adaptation of this story I ever came across. It seems like they only kept the names and setting (18th Century France) and used a very flimsy story to tie together one sword scene after another. I did try to follow the story while trying to forget the original, but it truly is nothing else than hollow characters fighting each other. Not that the fighting scenes are bad, but most of them are hidden by the very bad lightning that haunts this movie throughout. Because of this much of the choreography is invisible and it's hard to follow who's who and what is happening. Then about the acting not much of that going on as only Catherine Deneuve (giving quite a funny rendition of the Queen), Stephen Rae (as Richilieu) and Stephen Roth (as a new character and overall nemesis Febre) can convince that there was actually a script in existence somewhere in the production. What makes it even harder to comprehend is all the different accents used some are American, some English and then of course English with a French accent. Only some of the actors don't seem to be able to make up their mind which one they are going to use, even changing in mid-sentence.I would like to give a strong point why this movie is worth watching , but it's very hard as there is nothing really original to draw your attention.

They're just plain annoying.Hey, is that it? Didn't the film receive enough funding? Maybe they ran out of film, and simply couldn't afford retakes when they were sorely needed. Or maybe the director simply didn't bother looking trough the dailies. Ah, there are so many possibilities...Kung-Fu fightingIt was easy enough to see that the fighting had close ties to the Kung-Fu classics. I actually rather enjoyed that, but also here better editing, and maybe also more concise photography, would have helped. It just doesn't help to have a lot of fast fighting in a film, if all the nice little details of the fight are lost. I'm sure this Xin-Xin-guy is an extremely good choreographer, but it just doesn't help if the director or DP can't shoot it right.Even so, the ladder fight was particularly cool, but sometimes I wondered if D'Artagnan wasn't more of a circus artist than a real musketeer in this film. Also, the many fast blows just didn't seem very plausible given the way real musketeers fight. Swords are actually quite heavy, but it looked more like they were all fighting with bamboo sticks. Another thing I think would have added a bit of tension in the film is the fact that it took time to reload the guns back then - a lot of time, in fact. So a musketeer shooting his gun like some revolver &#150; well, that's just plain laughable. So, my word of advice regarding film fights Don't overdo it! Especially when it's supposed to spice up an old European story like this. Europeans simply didn't know Kung-Fu fighting until the late seventies &#150; when the first Kung-Fu films got there. I'm not saying that it can't work. Just that it got a little out of hand in this film.VerdictAs a purely educational piece, this film is quite worth watching. It is a very good example of how bad a film can turn out, despite good actors and material. It actually made me so sad that I almost wanted to cry. Such a waste...

The action sequences themselves are kind of fun, nothing marvelous, but reasonably enjoyable to behold (particularly the carriage chase and climactic ladder fight, both of which were still rip-offs of similar scenes in Sleepy Hollow  and Once Upon a Time in China, respectively).  Too bad the rest of the movie is absolutely terrible.As an ominous sign of things to come, the movie begins terribly with hilariously cheaply done opening credits that a high school production might be proud of.  Then there's the cheesy adventure score played over the background, something else a high school band might be proud of.  Then we're introduced to male model Justin Chambers, who's a dead-on for Chris O'Donnell and is actually even less talented of an actor.  I'm quite certain even a high school production wouldn't be proud of his performance.Director Peter Hyams is usually a competent and reliable filmmaker, but his movies are getting bothersomely darker (in terms of lighting).  Sooner or later, it'll take a flashlight and night-vision goggles to wade through his future works.  The Musketeer is easily his worst-lit film to date.

This is a frightfully bad adaption of Alexandre Dumas' classic work, not so much because of the locations, sets and costumes used, which are all quite good, but because of the totally inept actors cast.You expect a cast of this type of movie to be dynamic and fun, to breathe life into the story, but they only prove to take it to the morgue. In fact, most of the cast either seems to lack the ability to act entirely, or seem to be in a daze of disbelief. Only Tim Roth manages to convey any emotion in his performance, and then he manages to overact quite regularly, as if to make up for those around him. Some exchanges between characters are so wooden in fact (expecially those between Justin Chambers and Mena Suvari) that I find it hard to believe that they learned their lines at all, but were reading their lines from a badly-muddled cue card. To call the acting poor is something of an understatement.If there is anything worth noting about this movie, it is the fight choreography, handled competently by Xin-Xin Xiong (Half Past Dead, Double Team) who seems to be destined to do live out his career doing great stunt coordination work in terribly subpar movies. The fights are crisp, complex and a spectacle to behold, but therein lies the problem, because they're also completely unbelievable. You don't expect a Musketeer to be making moves the likes of which would only be seen in 'The Matrix' or 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,' yet he does, and by the end of D'Artagnan's first fight, something just feels amiss.Unless you're a big fan of over-the-top fight scenes, I can't stress enough how much you should avoid this movie. 3 of 10.

I would have guessed that they tried to do a Hollywood-sized action movie on an independent drama expense budget, but they were able to bring in Xin-Xin Xiong, the choreographer for The Matrix and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  So, that surmise is incorrect.  Thus, it is just a bad movie.The direction is stylistic without reason.  Filtered lighting is used continuously, probably to try to add a sense of atmosphere.  However, the only atmosphere it adds is that of the audience being unable to see the actors clearly.  Some shots are just set up badly; you can see the blocking as blocking, and the actors just trying to hit their mark.Justin Chambers as D'Artagnan was a Chris O'Donnell look alike, and not much else.  He took no risks and his stakes were not high enough.  In short, he was boring.  The character of Planchet was introduced and then left, to do nothing.  There was not much character development.  In any way.  These were all stock characters.The one exception was Tim Roth as Febre.  For, whatever he had to work with, he made his character come alive.  He was dedicated, knew what he wanted, and had an inner life.I could not finish without discussing the fight choreography, created by Xin-Xin Xiong.  Technically, the fighting was amazing.  There is a Ladder fight, which should be in everyone's Top 10 Fight Scenes.  However, most of the fighting was not validated.  It was just fighting for a very small reason.  To have a big brawl fight is one thing, to have a big brawl fight after a tension-filled argument which leads to everyone in the bar getting involved is quite another.  Most of the fights were the first one.I think partly what happened is the creators didn't want to focus too long on the story, because of course, everyone knows the story of The Three Musketeers.  However, what happened was they took the story and edited it (all the 'useless' explanation areas).  Thus you had barely any dialogue with plot-forwarding devices, and no character development.  So, the story was stagnate and you didn't care about the characters.I would really have liked to have been behind the scenes for this movie, and seen how and why these decisions were made.  Maybe there was some higher idea behind it all, but probably it was just another victim of the Hollywood Movie Machine.

How do you make a mediocre film? Here's the answer -- start with a script that isn't particularly imaginative, add a few sub-standard actors in key parts, make sure the lighting is never quite right, use a film lab that can't quite get the colors right, use foley artists that don't quite get the background sounds right, and make the action a fusion of Zorro, Kung Fu, Indiana Jones, and Roy Rogers.  That, in a nutshell, is what they did with this film, The Musketeer.  I didn't expect a lot, but I expected more. There are a couple of fine performances. Tim Roth as the evil Febre is just plain evil. I first noticed him as Archibald Cunningham in Rob Roy (1995) where he also played a very evil person. In Musketeer he is so much better than the others that it just magnifies their mediocrity. Also Catherine Deneuve as the Queen and Steven Rey as Cardinal Richelieu were excellent. I was most disappointed in Mena Suvari as Francesca, young friend of the Queen. Her only half-believable line was near the end, after being shot, when she whispered to Dartagnan, I'm not dead, now go and kill him, referring to Febre. She has a prime role, but her expressions and delivery never seemed to ring true, even in this story which sometimes seemed more like The Princess Bride in style and depth than the other Musketeer films. Suvari just doesn't have the acting chops of many of the good young actors we are seeing today.Although he did not have the lead, much of the film focused on Dartagnan played by former model, Justin Chambers. He actually wasn't bad, but against the other fine actors his inexperience was greatly magnified. In all I thought he did a credible job.mild SPOILERS - As all musketeer films, they become all for one, one for all in some cause involving the king and/or queen, and have to defeat the enemy, often insiders. In this version, Febre had killed Dartagnan's parents when he was only a young boy, but got in one swing of the sword that blinded Febre in his left eye. Febre wanted revenge, Dartagnan wanted revenge, and the whole film uses about 90 minutes to set up their eventual showdown. Our interest is piqued by Febre's attempt to also kill the king and the queen. The last 5 minutes is the highly choreographed swordfight among very tall ladders. And, in the end, Dartagnan whispers to Richelieu, Bless me father, for I will sin. You will see me some night, as Richelieu assumes a worried look.When the credits roll we see a very large concentration of Asian stuntmen, and the action sequences have a strong Asian action quality to them, which in one way is a welcome change from the standard swordfights. The filming was in France, the film lab and sound lab were in Germany.  I look at the 1998 Mask of Zorro and see a beautiful film. I look at this Musketeer film and see one that looks amateurish in comparison. Still, with all its flaws, I found it mildly entertaining. It however is certainly a good example of how to make a mediocre film. Study it, class, and do the opposite.

The other part that really bothered me was Justin Chambers character of D'Artagnan.  His bad boy attitude also got on my nerves.  It was so bad you really don't want to route for him.  By the end of the film I really did not care who won the final fight scene.  If you are looking for a good film about the Musketeer's, don't rent this one.

They are easily classified into three main problems1) Poor choreography and equally poor execution of the fight scenes. 2) Absolutely embarrassing editing. 3) The most obvious continuity error I've ever seen.1) I was anticipating Crouching Tiger-style fight scenes, and was very disappointed. I had just seen The One with Jet Li the day before. The One incrementally improves on Crouching Tiger, Matrix and others of that ilk, while this movie is a huge step backwards. Score negative for the choreography. I hated the ladder fight and the rappelling tower fight was as dull as dishwater. The swordplay was slowed down by the need to insert fancy moves and the swords just got in the way when they tried Matrix-style stuff. It never meshed. Too bad, really.2) The editing was painful. I never quite felt that I was able to grok a scene before it cut to the next. I always felt like they were rushing me through the movie. And a lot of scenes just didn't play, for example the attack on the castle. Just about unwatchably confusing. In a word choppy.3) Continuity mistakes take you out of the movie. At one point, a tunic is left on a floor and you just know it will come back later. You wait and wait for someone to present it to the hero, and he's suddenly wearing it! Then he's not! And then it's presented to him. It's a little too late at this point to get emotional about it. I was stunned and quite disgusted by this point (I was already ranting to my fellow watchers about the editing.)One more thing to consider the plot is unique, in that it does not follow the Three Musketeers plot from the book by Dumas. So be it. But some will hate that.Now the good stuff.Despite being one of the most technically flawed movies I've ever seen, the story is actually somewhat watchable, because the acting is ok and the characters are likeable. If you are totally insensitive to bad technical qualities, you may actually enjoy this movie. And if you like to really rant and rave over bad movie making, you may love it -).

The plot is more of a side-step to see threads from a different perspective, one that focuses more on D'Artagnon and less on the brotherhood of Musketeers.  Other characters step back into the shadows as their peers are brought out into the plot, making this telling different from previous Musketeer flicks.  It would have been impossible to improve upon, or compete with, the early 1970's two-parter, and this interpretation honors its predecessors with plenty of swashbuckling swordplay and comaraderie.  There's just enough pyrotechnic display, astounding fight choreography, and romance to appeal to a variety of moviegoers.  The female characters are bolder than in most period films, strong and not merely window dressing.  Certainly, there are engaging men and women of all ages, something that is often lacking in current movies.  For the darker side, Tim Roth delivers a deliciously evil character that rivals his Rob Roy counterpart.  Justin Chambers captures the spirit of D'Artagnon, Catherine Deneuve is a monarch worth fighting for, and Mena Suvari's Constance is a spunky heroine to ease the hearts of all who wonder why women characters in films rarely fight for themselves.  The cast unites for an elegant and entertaining composition in action-adventure--no weak links here.

In both movies, you have some impressively done, eye-popping (especially to American audiences) fight choreography, and a filmmaker who has no idea how to shoot these scenes correctly.  I couldn't see Jackie Chan fighting in Rush Hour (I haven't bothered with its sequel), and whereas I got the distinct sense that something cool was happening in the early fight scenes in The Musketeer, director (and cinematographer) Peter Hyams didn't bother to let me get a good look at it.The climactic fight scene on the ladders in some damned impressive work.  I cheered, I crawled up in my seat, and then it didn't end, it just sort of... stopped.  I won't fault anyone for that; what WAS there was incredible to watch, and these guys were on a budget.Unfortunately, this is reflected in earlier scenes, too-- early in the film, the fight scenes (choreographed by a name new to American audiences, Xin Xin Xiong) look like Hyams shot them twice once from across the room, once in close-ups.  The result is a blended mess that lets me hear swords clanging, and lets me look at... a blur!The action is all going on out of frame.  Rush Hour director Brett Ratner is a hack music video director and we expect this from him.  Mr. Hyams has been doing this for nearly 30 years and whether this is his first martial arts film or not, I'd think the man would have some clue as to how to show off his choreographer's work.  But for whatever reason, he fell flat. Though we should have known this when he started doing Jean-Claude Van Damme movies.The script isn't bad.  Tiny scraps of character are thrown to D'Artagnan (Justin Chambers) and Febre (Tim Roth), and the Queen gets to have a grand old time as well.  The talking scenes are shot and directed quite well, the funny lines are funny, etc.For the action sequences, Hyams is at a loss, because by the time we get to the last one or two, which are quite good, we've already felt betrayed by the earlier ones, and have become bored.  In fact, this is set up during the opening credits, when we see each actor and their name, before we even meet their character hence, we haven't met these characters yet, so therefore we don't care to see them in the opening credits.  Yawn.  There's a reason better filmmakers put those at the END of the film, Pete.I put this one up there with the Jet Li vehicle Black Mask.  Some good lines, and action worth checking out, but this was not what we traditionally refer to as a good movie.  It was martial arts filler, while we wait for the Wachowski Brothers, or Ang Lee, or someone with that level of talent to make sure the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

The first is that this movie has almost nothing to do with the book the Three Musketeers.  Sure a few key plot points seem to leak through, but there is so little plot and tone missing that it is a crime. Renaming the major characters and changing the location (from France to say Australia) and only the most pedantic would be able to link this fiasco and the book.  Even the personalities of the characters are so skewed as to be unrecognizable, the only one coming close being Richelieu.The second thing that was absolutely egregious were the action sequences. A majority of them were little better than flashes of bodies and terrible clanging sounds.  Almost nothing was discernable in any of the sequences, and I think perhaps in one scene could you actually recognize one of the actors as the person doing the action.  This was billed as an action movie and turned into a ham handed melodrama with delusions of mediocrity.Add to this the fact that the only person who could really be said to have acted in this movie is Tim Roth (Mina Suvari comes close on a number of occasions but suffered from obviously horrible directing).  Although Tim Roth has experience in a very similar roll in Rob Roy.  Then there are the accents!  Two main characters had convincing French accents, Planchet (whose character is unrecognizable from the book) and the Queen.  Only problem is that the Queen is supposed to be Spanish!  Oh, and why is it that everyone except D'Artagnan can pronounce D'Artagnan correctly?There were a couple of pithy lines, a scant handful.  Not enough to have to sit through this piece of cinema, especially if you have read and enjoyed the novel at some point in your life.  Incidently I am not alone in my feelings for this movie.

"}{"Title":"Adheres to the standard revenge plot of any vintage spaghetti western","Date":"6 February 2008","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Romance","Review":" Veteran film director Peter Hyams remakes Alexander Dumas' venerable novel The Three Musketeers in the singular as The Musketeer. Basically, the traditional Three Musketeers fade into the background, while the fourth Musketeer revives and inspires them. Scenarist Gene Quintano and Hyams have pared down the sprawling Dumas classic, so it adheres to the standard revenge plot of any vintage spaghetti western. Furthermore, Hyams hired legendary Hong Kong stunt choreographer Xin-Xin Xiong to energize the sword play. Predictably, romance takes a back seat to the slashing sword fights staged every quarter-hour to break up the expository dialogue interludes. Anachronistic as most of its witty repartee sounds, The Musketeer delivers enough dazzling derring-do to offset its hackneyed story without indulging into obligatory blood and gore. No, this agile, old-fashioned, but superficial swashbuckler cannot eclipse Richard Lester's definitive The Three Musketeers. Occasionally, The Musketeer stumbles over plot points but never loses its footing. Alas, as our eponymous hero, former Calvin Klein model Justin Chambers lacks the necessary charisma, much less a tolerable French accent. Clearly, he cannot rival Errol Flynn. Nevertheless, this timeless tale of bravado proves just as appealing now as it must have been when acrobatic Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., played D'Artagnan in the 1921 silent production.Writer Gene Quintano preserves the conventions and clichés of the period costume drama. Indeed, The Musketeer looks like a Gallic horse opera. Our hero wears a broad-brimmed hat, and everybody refers to Tim Roth's villain as 'the-man-in-black.' Were that not enough, D'Artagnan talks to his horse like Gene Autry! As this brisk melodrama unfolds, little D'Artagnan has been fencing with his lame father (Luc Gentil) when Febre (Tim Roth) and his henchmen ride up. They demand tax money. D'Artagnan's father refuses to pay. Not only does Febre skewer him in front of his son, but also he murders D'Artagnan's mother. He kicks D'Artagnan in the face twice, but not before the tenacious tot slashes him across the left eye. Afterward, Febre dons a black leather patch that compliments his Snidely Whiplash demeanor. Later, he puts a knife to a small girl's throat, and she bears the scar of his treachery to D'Artagnan. Well, of course, had he slain our hero, then there would have been no Musketeer. Nevertheless, three instances occur when the script takes left turns, but in each case the filmmakers recover none the worse for wear. D'Artagnan's friend, guardian & mentor Planchet (Jean-Pierre Castaldi of Moonraker) helps him bury his parents then agrees to raise him. Our tyke-sized hero vows revenge and so ends the pre-credit sequence! Afterward, the title Fourteen Years Later appears. Funny thing is Planchet doesn't age a day during the near decade-and-a-half that elapses. At least, the hulking, long-haired Jean-Pierre Castaldi gives a flavorful performance. Too bad he never got to brandish those two pistols concealed in his shirt sleeves. Anyway, Planchet takes D'Artagnan off to Paris. Along the way, against Planchet's advice, our hero stops off at a tavern for breakfast. He winds up fighting three swordsmen and defeating them with his impressive sword fighting skills. Oh, yes, all this happened because D'Artagnan defended a starving peasant boy groveling for table scraps. Watching our Boy Scout hero balance on wine barrels and cross swords at the same time is invigorating stuff. Indeed, The Musketeer is a movie for guys. Happily, Hyams and Xiong gradually intensify each sword fight until the ultimate battle royal between Febre and D'Artagnan on a number of ladders in a three-story barn. When D'Artagnan arrives in Paris, he finds the Musketeers disbanded and drowning their troubles in strong drink. Aramis (Nick Moran of Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels) and Porthos (Steve Speirs of Star Wars Episode 1-The Phantom Empire) explain that Richelieu has imprisoned his father's old friend Treville (Michael Byrne of The Eagle Has Landed) on a trumped-up murder charge. Coincidentally, later that same evening, D'Artagnan runs into both Aramis and Porthos on the streets. He persuades them to help him rescue Treville.When D'Artagnan isn't on a crusade, he has a room on credit at a nearby hotel, and comely chambermaid Francesca (Mena Suivari of American Pie 2) flirts with him. Literally, in one of the film's funnier scenes, D'Artagnan drops in on Francesca while she is bathing. Fiesty Francesca saves D'Artagnan's neck later when Richelieu's men come for him. Our doe-eyed lovers squeeze in a couple of kisses when they aren't eluding evildoers. Cardinal Richelieu (Stephen Rea) plots to discredit the King (Daniel Mesguich) and Queen (Catherine Deneuve of Indocine). Specifically, he wants to embarrass British envoy Lord Buckingham (Jeremy Clyde of North Sea Hijack), but he prefers the less blood shed the better. Febre thirsts for blood. He has already killed the Spanish envoy, and he steadily grows mad with power until not even Richelieu can restrain him. Abducting the Queen, Febre sends a fake message to Buckingham to lure him to her castle. Febre hopes the jealous King will find them in each other's arms and kill him, triggering a war with England. Meanwhile, D'Artagnan leads an army of Musketeers off to rescue Francesca trapped alongside the Queen and Buckingham in the castle.Director Peter Hyams of Outland and End of Days succeeds more often than fails with The Musketeer. Personally, I applaud his strategy to shoot as much as possible under genuine candlelight. Okay, Stanley Kubrick did it first in 1975 with Barry Lyndon. Nevertheless, if you yearn for realism, The Musketeer looks fairly authentic, not like a garish Technicolor Tom & Jerry cartoon. The tavern fight is dark, but never so dark that you cannot catch of glimpse of the real actors as they slash and gash. The Musketeer isn't top-notch Dumas adaptation but it holds it own. Although Quintano contrived the script, the flippant dialogue belongs to Hyams. Considering the tragedy we Americans have suffered, The Musketeer qualifies as the only entertaining escapism that should leave you feeling better than when you entered the theater.

However, Hyam's flick fails to connect the dots and bring cinema's three big C's (cogency, cohesion, and coherence) to the epic story. The litany of flaws is a long one with poor casting choices in Suvari and Chambers, comic relief which is ill timed, cliche stunts where real swordsmanship should be, a conglomeration of accents among the many French characters, etc. However, the film does have a substantial up-side with great costuming and locations, a good supporting cast with Roth and Rea embracing their characters well, and a sense of earnestness about trying to have the same swashbuckling devil-may-care flair which has been the hallmark of everything Musketeer from Dumas to date.

Unfortunately, this individual was either without a smidgen of taste in film, or had not actually seen it. The fights, whilst showing potential, and having been choreographed by one quite skilled within the world of them... really don't work. They're wildly out of place and the way they are shot makes it confusing to the point where I, ironically, found myself particularly bothered by this whenever it had them. For crying out loud, the majority of the time you can't even tell which of the people involved in them is which, much less what's going on. Somewhat like Episode III of Star Wars, the cinematography(done by Hyams, himself, aiding the man in proving that he has absolutely no skills within the field of movie-making) makes it tough to tell how much progress is made in the battles... but at least the action in that was entertaining and pleasant to look at. I realize that I have so far devoted every word of this comment to this one subject, but I really can't claim that I had high hopes for anything else in the production being worth even a fleeting glance. Misdirected by Peter Hyams, I mean, has the man done a single piece that was cause of, well, *any* rejoicing? Sudden Death, which was a hackneyed attempt at cashing in on the success of the far superior Die Hard, Timecop, which was a shameful waste of an interesting concept(made only worse, somehow, by its sequel), and End of Days was passable at best. My gosh, the man even managed to mess up the sequel to 2001 A Space Oddyssey, which, granted, was an enormously difficult film to try to follow, but why was it even tried in the first place(and Hyams gets double credit for screwing that one up, because he penned it, as well)? The acting is mostly just bad. From the random, scattered and half-hearted attempts that are made at French accents, to the title role player who manages to be out-done by the kid who portrays him as a young boy. What's with the opening credits looking like the intro to a 70's show? The dialog has its moments, but then there are the times where it is so obvious, with a complete lack of respect for subtlety and proper story-telling... honestly, a character or two seemed put in the film for no other reason than to spout expositionary lines. In attempts to draw in young men and young women, respectively, Suvari and Chambers(the film's excuse for a male lead) both get a scene, one more useless than the next, in which one of them is naked(without nudity, to preserve the PG-13 rating), and Chambers also briefly flirts with a woman seemingly put in this for no other reason than to put her cleavage on the screen. The two leads also have a poorly crafted and inexplicable romance, added for no other reason than to make the final bit personal(because obviously that wasn't the very first thing done in this). The plot is not all bad, and has ideas that could deserve attention. Rea is a fine enough Richelieu, and I can assure you that Roth makes an imposing and utterly monstrous villain, who also manages to be quotable(as the only one in the entire flick). An effective reveal on him, after a certain event in the film, would have been nice, but you can't have everything(and in this case, you can't get much at all). Really, all in all, this has very little going for it. And that's too bad, because almost everything in the film needed just a little push in the right direction for a viewing of this to be time well spent, but a large group of lackluster and average things, coupled with a few downright bad ones... well, I'm sure you can deduce what this results in. I recommend this only to those who wish to watch every visual representation of Dumas' famous novel(As you've never seen it before, indeed, but this is proof that such is not necessarily a positive) that has come into existence and the teenagers who find the sound(or, rather, the potential visual) of either star in their birthday suit too good to pass up. Anyone else... life's too short. 4/10 "},{"Title":"No, it's not The Matrix, but it's not Batman & Robin either","Date":"17 January 2003","Score":"4 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Romance","Review":"  I just saw this and it's no way near as bad as it's rep. People on the IMDb are saying it's one of the worst films ever made (!) - how many films have they seen? Proberbaly only The Matrix and Spider-Man. The Three Musketeers were unrecognisable in the film, not the dashing heroes we're used to, but D'Artagnon was the coolest (and funniest) so far and the fight scenes were far and away the best ever in a Musketeer movie. The sword fights weren't your usual prancing about, but intense and frantic, much like the Jedi's duels with Darth Maul in The Phantom Menace. The Jackie Chan-style stunts and the changes to the novel were controversial, but the fresh approach added to the film for me. If you expect a classic adaption of the novel with traditional swashbucking, forget it. Instead look for an updated take on the story with lavish and atmospheric visuals, a cool-yet-relatable D'Artagnon, Mena Suvari, loads of intense sword fighting and spectacular stunts.

I guess it didn't occur to the filmmakers that the modern fighting techniques didn't REALLY exist during the day, but never mind. This film is pretty dull, boring and curiously rushed (the dialogue is going a mile a second, why were they pushing it so fast?) the story is boringly directed by classic hack director Hyams, and most of the boredom shows on the actors. Catherine Deneuve is quite wasted here. I am not too sure what she was doing there in the first place. Sorry Justin Chambers, your 15 minutes are UP.The good thing are the stunt sequences, which again, I have to question whether, you know, ladder balancing sword fights actually took place during the day.

This movie is an insult to the history. The queen Ann of Austria was 26 or 27 at the time when the action is supposed to be. Catherine Deneuve could have played the role of queen's grand mother (or even the grand-grand mother's role). Couldn't the director have found a much younger actress for this role??? The same problem is with the king's role. He could have almost played the role of king's grand father, and the role of Henry IV in the best case. I wouldn't have bought the movie if I have looked first on IMDb. This is the worst movie whit the Musketeers I have seen out of other 4.

This movie has the look and feel of a tv movie.  Perhaps it went straight to video and I didn't know.  That's gotta be the dumbest and perhaps ugliest D'Artagnan I've ever seen.  The movie is very choppy.  Fades to black when it shouldn't.  And the physics controling space and time are absurd.  What is this?  Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon? Is it rubbish.?  Not quite, but it's pretty close.  I think with a better script and direction that might have been a promising movie.And what the heck is Stephen Rea in here for?  He plays better good guys than a villain such as this. All I can say is watch Michael York's version .

I thought it was a good movie, but nothing special.  From the previews it looked pretty cool, but a little too over-the-top with respect to the fight scenes.  After seeing the movie, I didn't think it was too over-the-top.  All the major stunts are seen in the trailer, so there really isn't anything too shocking to see in the movie that you didn't already see in the trailer.  As far as the story goes, it was pretty good, but nothing new.  As for the cast, I thought they all did a pretty good job.  Mena Suvari and Tim Roth are the only people I'd previously heard of, and they both did a good job.  I thought Justin Chambers did a good job as well.  And there isn't anything bad I can say about the rest of the cast.  I'm not really sure what to say about this movie other than, I thought it was ok, but no block-buster.
