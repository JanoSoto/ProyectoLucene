[{"Title":"fun clever comedy","Date":"15 August 2001","Score":"66 out of 83 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  As gays and lesbians have achieved more and more acceptance in our society, a countervailing force &#150; led mostly by conservative religious organizations - has been rearing its head in recent years.  The movement is often referred to as `reparative therapy,' the rather absurd notion that, with just a little grit, determination and behavior modification, homosexuals can be `cured' of their `illness' and groomed to take their place as fine, upstanding members of the heterosexual community.  Certain `treatment centers' dedicated to this dubious cause have even begun to spring up in areas around the country, modeling themselves after 12-step programs like Alcoholics Anonymous.The makers of `But I'm a Cheerleader' have chosen to have a little fun with the concept, imagining one of these centers in almost surrealistic terms. Sweet-faced Natasha Lyonne stars as Megan, a regular teenager happily content to give her all to her cheerleading squad and only mildly confused as to why she can't seem to get quite as excited by her boyfriend as by thoughts of her buxom cheerleader buddies.  Suspecting her of being a lesbian &#150; long before Megan herself does, actually &#150; her `concerned' parents, friends and boyfriend cart her off to True Directions, a treatment center tucked safely away in the country.  In this bucolic setting, Megan and a group of other `deviants' are put through the rigors of a 5-step therapy program which includes admitting their homosexuality, undergoing gender role playing and even `practicing' man/woman sexual behavior under the stern tutelage of the mistress of the place.  In keeping with the near-surrealism of the subject matter, the center is done up in an almost Montessori school motif, with bold colored walls and furniture somehow emphasizing the cold, inhuman sterility of the setting.`But I'm a Cheerleader' is, by no means, a great or entirely successful comedy.  Its attempts at humor, particularly in its opening scenes, seem a bit forced and heavy-handed at times. Moreover, the tone shifts a bit uneasily every so often, running the gamut from stylized absurdity to heartbreaking seriousness.  Still, the undisciplined messiness is really part of the film's overall charm.  It removes the work from the same category as all those ultra-slick bubble-headed comedies about teens that major studios seem to release with frightening regularity.  And the movie does have many laugh-out-loud moments of inspired lunacy, showing to what preposterous lengths many straights and even some pressured gays will go in order to `correct' the uncorrectable.  We see the girls being given instructions on how to use a vacuum cleaner, wear makeup and change diapers. The boys are instructed in the fine arts of wood chopping, throwing a football and fixing cars.  These scenes work, in particular, not only for their comic effectiveness but their underlying poignancy, as these scared youngsters &#150; many threatened with disownment by their parents if they don't `straighten up' &#150; give it their all, against all hope, to truly change, to deny the very person their raging hormones are screaming at them to be.The movie also manages to make the gay characters seem real and believable. Thanks to a superb cast, many of the teens emerge as touching, three-dimensional people rather than the cartoon characters that they might have become in a similar film of this kind - particularly when it would be so easy for them to become so in the face of the caricatures of parents and camp counselors who swirl around them in this highly stylized setting. Prime among these is Cathy Moriarty, brilliant as Mary, the prim and proper leader of the establishment, a woman whose righteous wrong-headedness the actress captures to a comic tee.   In contrast, Rue Paul, out of drag for once, gives a superbly understated performance as an `ex-gay' now working for the enemy.  Among the teens, Lyonne and Clea DuVall, as the girl Megan falls in love with, are the obvious standouts.  They turn these potentially cardboard comic characters into full-sized, instantly recognizable young women filled with yearning, confusion and a desire to both please others and be true to themselves.And that is the ultimate message of this film.  Though done in an absurd way, the movie strives to point out that all of us must be allowed to be who we are and to live the life that best suits us.  Whether we are gay, straight or whatever, that's a philosophy of life we all need to be reminded of from time to time.

Their bedroom is a riot of pink satin, ribbons and lace worthy of Mae West.The girls have to wear pink uniforms and do housework; the boys are in blue and have to learn to chop wood, work on cars and learn football. Watching RuPaul work on a car is worth the price of admission alone.Each of the kids has a 'root,' - the reason they became gay ranging from `a traumatic bris' to `my mother got married in pants.'Larry and Lloyd (Richard Moll and Wesley Mann, respectively) are priceless as two of the first clients of True Direction and are now self described ex-ex-gays.

Well at first, the two hate each other, but then soon afterwords, become friends.  Graham tells her that no one can change who you are, but Megan is determined to graduate.  Suddenly, the relationship between the two of them becomes more than friends, and Megan realizes she wants to be with Graham, and it doesn't matter what anyone else says, she will always be Megan, head cheerleader, and lesbian.

But it is a lot more than that. If you watch carefully, this is an incredibly honest, revealing and touchingly sensitive film on teenage identity crisis and identity search interacting with social influences. It tells you more than any psychology book could tell on adolescence, because one cannot put all that into words. Natasha Lyonne as 17 year old Megan (the heroine of the story) demonstrates amazing qualities of acting in a role which is probably the most demanding any actor or actress can face that of a changing adolescent personality re-discovering one's inner, formerly suppressed unconscious self over two months, while still remaining herself in a way. If you compare her different faces at different phases of the story, e.g. when she just cannot think of anything at the camp, and when she looks into the bathroom mirror much later in the film washing her teeth, you will see what I mean. If you are not distracted by hilariously funny bits and jokes and you do not consider poor acting by Cathy Moriarty, it is in fact a top quality drama made superbly. Intimate conversations between the two leading actors (Natasha Lyonne and Clea DuVall) tell more in one minute of this film about life than most movie star celebrities do throughout their whole career. Natasha Lyonne should have received an Oscar for this as best actress, and she should have been offered leading roles in less superficial films than American Pie. A talent wasted. Her performance in this film is an extraordinary achievement and a very touching experience for anyone sensitive enough to resonate to it. I highly recommend it for re-watching it several times you will not get bored if you are attentive enough.

I'd say that But, I'm a Cheerleader (BIAC, for short) could've probably been a somewhat amusing little film had the script not been such a inane mess right from the start.Personally, judging from what I saw, I'd say that neither the director nor the blasted screenwriters had the slightest understanding at all when it came to the many subtle nuances of homosexuality. I mean, these guys couldn't have possibly had the least bit of insight into the subject, otherwise BIAC would've surely been destined to become something of a certified cult movie classic, indeed.Megan Bloomfield, a cute, 17 year-old, high school cheerleader, is suspected (for the most preposterous reasons imaginable), by her less-than-enlightened parents, of being 100% lesbian. (Oh, my gosh!) You know, I really wonder how many level-headed parents out there go through this sort of ordeal, trying to determine whether the peculiar behaviour of their little brat indicates sexual deviance from the so-called norm? The method taken to get Megan normal, and back onto the old straight and narrow again, was to promptly send her (thanks to dear old dad & mom) to a ridiculous reparative therapy camp aptly named True Directions.Run like a concentration camp by an outrageously strict disciplinary named Mary Brown, it's here that the students (otherwise referred to as homosexual misfits) are put onto a regimental 5 step-program (very similar to that of AA's) that's supposedly guaranteed to convert even the most hardened homo-slut into a perfectly wholesome, happy, little hetero-twinkie in no time flat.And from this point onwards BIAC was nothing but a moronic chant of - 2-4-6-8 - God is good.

Lyonne, usually cast as the ballbreaking loudmouth, is surprisingly effective as the girly girl, and DuVall will no doubt stir up those confusing Linda Hamilton feelings in America's male geeks. They are maybe the most satisfying couple onscreen since Robert Forster and Pam Grier in JACKIE BROWN.

While controversial, this movie speaks of a topic quite openly that was more or less taboo in 1999, at least to someone with a conservative background. Due to the rarity of the subject matter, this movie already peaks a certain interest in the open-minded movie-goer. The movie treats the topic of homosexuality lightly, with a comedic air. The audience can feel this aura from the overwhelming light and dancy colors that parade the screen. You will be amazed at how many everyday items can be found in bright pink and blue, from the house itself down to the last dishtowel. The background music also feels like it comes from a 50s TV sitcom, a prancy xylophone concert, which becomes irritating after playing non-stop for several minutes. All of these slight annoyances, however, really end up making you laugh at the entire situation to begin with.This movie is easy to follow, with little unaddressed, except for how Megan's parents appeared to have disowned her in two seconds when they were so open and understanding at the beginning of the movie, having watched videos about this disorder and leafed through many pamphlets from a man in a Straight is Great T-shirt. How they came to disown her so quickly was quite a mystery. It seems to be thrown out as a sudden battle Megan must fight, something to antagonize her just enough to romanticize her plight.Plot events are predictable. The girl that treats Megan with the most disdain in the beginning ends up becoming her girlfriend, a typical example of opposites attract. What is even more predictable is that any person who watches this movie knows that this True Directions boot camp is not going to do anything close to its objective except make attendees even more homosexual than they probably were in the beginning, especially Megan. The movie fluffs homosexuality to such a point that all these characters have almost no common sense or depth beyond their sexuality whatsoever. The brave, true-to-themselves bunch all run off at the end, happily ever after in a random, never-before-seen, pick-up truck that miraculously becomes decorated with hearts like a marriage getaway car. Megan's cheer at the end is cute, borderline cheesy, a must for a main character of a movie in which cheerleader appears in the title. Don't we all wish we could live in such a doll house world?Men who are looking for lesbian action in this movie will be disappointed. Overall, this movie serves its purpose to make light of a matter and make people laugh all at once. Being that it was funny and an interesting topic, versus having a plot line that began to melt into a growing puddle as the movie progressed, with shallow characters swimming about, I'd say this film deserves a 4/10.

Anyway being the good Christians they are, Natasha's sent off to one of those reorientation centers so popular now among fundamentalist Christians, those who refuse to recognize such evil people as Freud and Kinsey and their work, and want to raise normal heterosexual kids.The place is called True Directions and it's run by this huckster of a woman played by Cathy Moriarty. She's the nurse Ratched of the Christian psychological group, she plays the part beautifully. She's assisted by RuPaul Charles out of drag who's a graduate of her center and son Eddie Cibrian, a really hunky sort who's a role model for the boys and a sex object for the girls.But I'm a Cheerleader doesn't quite have the production values of a studio film, but no regular studio would make something like this. It's a topic that needs to be addressed, the fraud of these ex-gay ministries.When I was a working person at New York State Crime Victims Board, I had a case from a rural part of upstate New York. It concerned a young teenage girl who came from a fundamentalist background like our protagonist here. She and the young wife of the youth pastor of the church she came from, discovered their true nature and fell in love and consummated their first sex at a Bible Conference.Of course when mom discovered what was going on by snooping through her daughter's computer, the young wife was arrested and given a slap on the wrist by the judge because he thought it was too much the case. Nevertheless the woman is now a registered sex offender.The young girl was put right into therapy and as long as I live, I will never forget the remark the therapist made on his report to us that the girl is refusing to cooperate in the therapy because she did not consider herself a victim. It's also why her lover got off as lightly as she did. That case is the reason I enjoyed this film so much and recommend it highly to audiences, especially young gay audiences.

This was a while ago and I had forgotten about the movie but I picked up the box at the rental store the other day and decided to make my own judgments.  This story was a stroke of genius!  A cheerleader who thinks she is straight, talked into being a lesbian by a bunch of people trying to make her straight, well, they talked her into the realization that she was, in fact,homosexual, although, I don't think I'd enjoy kissing Megan's boyfriend either, I thought he'd drown her in his salava.This movie was in the spirit of some John Waters' films I hold close to my heart.  Mink Stole (Cry-Baby) must smell a great movie from a mile away. The casting was great.  Cathy Moriarty was so funny as the spokesperson for the kind of normalcy preached in the 1950's.  RuPaul was hilarious as the reformed closet homosexual, Julie Delpy (Before Sunrise) proves again to be the mysterious and beautiful European type character.  Lastly, but most importantly, Natasha Lyonne and Clea DuVall.  These two women, who are spectacular actors in themselves, had strong and intense chemistry.  Their portrayals of Megan and Graham were up to perfection and I truly believed in their characters, in short, they just really got me.This movie is perfect for anyone who wants to see two people, who were meant for each other, overcoming obstacles to be together.  And their obstacles were hilarious.  I almost died during the sexual simulationYou know who you are and you know who you want. Aint nothin' gonna change that, s***!

First of all, yes the movie is full of stereotypes, but that's the point.  They're there to show how ridiculous these stereotypes really are and to show that in the end, you cannot change who you are, you just have to learn to accept it and get the people around you to accept you.  Second, some stereotypes that I've heard people notice really weren't there.  I don't think anywhere in the movie did they try to make Christians look stupid (hey, the homophobic Christians are pretty good at making themselves look stupid WITHOUT help).  Okay maybe Megan's comment about God is good, God is straight - hey that's pretty good, but still, I think sometimes people LOOK for something to be offended by.  I think this movie does make fun of many straight people, who claim that gays are recruiting, when it is actually the other way around (as one can see by the existence of True Directions, and in the fact that when Megan asks them to teach her to be a lesbian, they tell her that they can't do that).  All in all, this is a great movie and I really enjoyed it!

In the meantime gay women and men are so hungry for representation, so starved to see themselves on the silver screen, that even junk like this is welcomed.Comparisons to John Waters' films are inevitable because But I'm a Cheerleader is low budget, gay-friendly, and rife with poor acting.  The concept is indeed fertile if any movement is ripe for skewering it's the convert-a-homosexual movement.  Unfortunately the execution is overstated and witless.  The targets have been satirized so often there is little bite left in rehashing the same simple stereotypes.  Making the straights so preposterously anachronistic further sanitizes the potential for humor. The fable is meant to be contemporary, but the well-meaning bad guys are right out of a 1950's nightmare of conformity that barely existed even in the 1950's.  All the girls in pink, all the boys in blue?  Well, if nothing else, it's easy to follow.Cathy Moriarty plays the founder of True Directions, but her lackluster performance seems more like your typical Mary Woronov star turn.  RuPaul was clearly cast with an eye towards irony (he is out of drag here), but his limitations as an actor overshadow the joke.  Other cast members have likewise been seen elsewhere to better advantage.  Only the two young romantic (female) leads are appealing, yet even when triumphant they remain inexplicably bland and one-dimensional.  It's one thing to show lead characters with the life sucked out of them by a conservative society, another to weigh down the film with their lifelessness.But I'm a Cheerleader should have been hilarious.  It's too bad that the filmmakers approached the material with a kindergartener's point of view. The resulting film is so dull it gives camp a bad name.

All the adults in the film are obsessed with the sexual orientation of the kids which is part of the satire, this is one thing, but the film itself seems equally obsessed with it all the time, including the many scenes that don't feature any adults. Everything the kids do seems to relate to their sexual orientation, not even for a minute are they shown being, you know, just human beings.But the bigger problem is that it is simply not a good or very fun movie. All the characters are incredibly inconsistent and you'll struggle to find anything clever in the plotting or in the humor which is kind of cute, inoffensive, and rarely particularly funny.It's also not believable for a minute. The reform school is lead by two teachers who don't have the least bit of authority. They rely on the teenagers' good-will to pay any attention to their rules and lessons or to even stay at the camp, and paying attention they sure do even when they don't even want to be healed (half the time the kids want to become straight, half the time they don't, it changes from scene to scene).In the end 'But I'm a Cheerleader' seems more like an excuse for the set designers, the costume designers and the makeup artists to go full camp. It's nowhere near impressive enough in those regards that one could actually call the film stylish, but along with the actors who have fun playing their stereotypes it's probably the main thing that keeps the film entertaining enough to be at least quite watchable.

Of course, in today's age (2013, soon to be 2014) this hopefully isn't as accepted, but back in 1999, parents just didn't know what to do when they weren't promised a married man/woman grandchild.Along the journey in this camp, Megan meets a whole lot of interesting and wonderful characters, each with depth and wonderful stories of their own.

It's a brave movie, discussing the topic many feel either uncomfortable talking about or just is an awkward topic many don't understand. It's homosexuality. This movie is for homosexually, but many people in the film treat it as a cancer to a person. Its unnatural, unwanted, and not understanding in this world. My view on homosexuality is that people can be however they want. If you find someone you love that loves you back you're the luckiest person in the world. It doesn't matter the sex as long as you're happy with what you have. Period.Megan Bloomfield (Natasha Lyone) is considered gay by her family, friends, and classmates. She's a cheerleading captain, has a picture of Melissa Etheridge, she fantasizes about cheerleaders when kissing her boyfriend, and she is a vegetarian. Oh yeah, she's gay! Better get her looked at. Just by the mild things she is accused of you can tell being homosexual is really frowned upon in this world. Her parents ship her to Teen Directions, a place run by a strict leader, Mary Brown (Cathy Moriarty) and where they teach kids to stay in the closet and be the way God meant.In Teen Directions, Megan meets Graham Eaton (Clea DuVall), a girl who comes from wealthy parents who threaten to disown her is she doesn't become straight. She refuses to change at the same time afraid to live a life as a lesbian without any trouble. So naturally, Megan and Graham become attached to each other and the rest can be picked out.This film is more about homosexuality, it too teaches gender roles of both male and female. In the four step program in the film, Step 2 is Step 2 Rediscovering Your Gender Identity where both sides take on tasks of being a male or female to try and focus on their job reminding them what their role is in life. Though this only makes Graham and Megan hang out and get more and more attached. So it just helps matter rather than solves.This movie is a hard one to explain because of the unusual plot and so much there needs to be said. I can go on for an hour to describe what morals and themes are found within But I'm a Cheerleader!, but some are major than others. I believe I covered the major points in this film and figure that I picked the key points of the film. All in all, it's a great movie, and Natasha Lyone plays a perfect protagonist, being not to bright, but kind hearted which is enough to expect out of the lead female role. Also, perfect musical soundtrack here as well. Excellent, catchy music that fits well to not only the tone, but the vibe and feel of the story as well.

This movie is one of the handfuls of gay movies that I find actually enjoyable (Brokeback Mountain not being one of them.) But I'm a Cheerleader follows teens as they are dehomosexualized at an Ex-gay camp. The 2 notable actors in this movie are RuPaul Charles (or just RuPaul if you're nasty) and Clea Duvall (well 3 if you want to count original Dreamlander and filth goddess Mink Stole.) Watching RuPaul play a semi-butch closeted ex gay was extremely hilarious. No one can do camp like Ms. Ru does camp. And this what this movie is, extremely campy. I love campy and over the top when it's done right. The thought of de-gaying these teens through various gender identifying role playing is great. The girls sleep in all pink rooms, wear all pink and handle objects in their simulations that are painted pink. While the boys fix blue cars, have blue guns, a blue ax and blue clothes.Our protagonist, Natasha Lyonne, is a good Catholic cheerleader who is sent away to this ex-gay camp because she eats tofu, doesn't liked being kissed by her sloppy kissing boyfriend, and hugs some of the other cheerleaders for too long. What makes this movie great is that it isn't one of those gay movies that shoves it down your throat or one that tries to show the reality of actual gays. What makes it great is that it doesn't take itself or gays that seriously while remaining serious at the same time. Make sense? It doesn't try to be preachy. It makes fun of gays and even more so, those who claim to be ex-gays.Cathey Moriarty (of Casper fame) runs the camp. It's her job to make sure that the teens are de-gayed and perform in the sex simulation at the end of camp. And, at the same time, trying to butch-up her son, CSI Miami's own Eddie Cibrian. But I'm a Cheerleader teaches gays to laugh at their sexually and those who oppose it. That no matter how many fake babies' diapers you change, how many logs you chomp chop, or how many people of the opposite sex you kiss you're gay, accept it.

But what exactly does it satirize?","Date":"1 January 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  But I´m a Cheerleader (great title by the way, that begs for a change, marketingwise) is a one-joke-movie and the joke must have looked a lot more persuasive on paper than it does on the screen. Basic idea is that parents are so scared of their offsprings homosexuality that they send them away to reform-camp, in order to heal and get straight again. Problem is that the picture isn´t out there to hurt or even trouble its audience. We´re with the young and sympathetic reformees from the word go and the parents as well as the reformers are dismal jerks we can all feel superior to. The movie preaches to the converted and that´s all the more sad as such reform institutions for young gays and lesbians seem to exist in real life in the United States. As much as I may subscribe to this movies intentions, its execution is far from daring.

I also knew the critics who are always too picky panned this film almost unanimously, so i knew the deck was stacked against my theater experience in this case. However, what I got was a delightful romp about a girl trying to offset her parents shame with her homosexuality by finding her own pride with herself despite the back drop of a  we make gays straight clinic type thingy. Again as opposed to some critics I thought the piece was well acted, well written etc. Natasha Lyonne, always a sweetie scores again just as she did in Slums of Beverly Hills. Clea Devall as Gram is compelling  as the street edged would be reformed  camper who becomes Megan's ( Natasha's) significant other. Bud Cort is splendid as the dad in a small role. Also Michelle Williams of Dawson;s Creek has a cute cameo turn and Rupaul has a feature role as a reformed gay man who serves as instructor to the soon to be ex gay charges in his care at the clinic. Rupaul takes a rare go at being himself in his male personna sans hair and with gotee and is delightful in this change of pace for the  transvestite entertainer. Anyway all in all The movie is a a lot of fun, a great turn on ( unless u r catholic in which case you may become offended) , has sweet twists on a predictable love story ending and  is the best movie I have seen this year even in the face of recently seeing the super  film chicken run.

Hopefully, most who view this film will have enough personal knowledge of gay men and women to chuckle at the stereotypical characters, while acknowledging their limitations as representatives of the gay community. Essentially, the film is a satire on conversion therapy, an alternative to being gay by which one is converted to heterosexuality. Not a bad premise for a satire, but in this instance, one that doesn't quite work. The subject matter is reduced to a series of silly gags that aren't outrageous or entertaining enough to make you belly laugh or overlook the total absurdity of it all. The cast is first rate and they do the best they can with the material. It's especially nice to see Mink Stole in a non-John Waters film, although ironically, he might have been able to do a better job at the helm. Another observation surfaced as I thought about the film later perhaps it's time for a serious film about the pitfalls of conversion therapy. It's actually no laughing matter and a dubious treatment for a lifestyle that clinicians do not consider an illness.

First off, I love Clea DuVall, so I paraded to this movie opening weekend, even though I had no desire to see it, but in all honesty, it was really a lot better than I thought it would be. Cathy Moriarty was hilarious as the camp's mistress, and Natasha Lyonne plays a very witty and funny lesbian who is in denial of her sexuality. Even though the movie can be hokie at times, it was still worth the price of my movie ticket. Even the bar 'Cocksucker' rised a chuckle in my throat, and the poly-vinyl bright pink and blue costumes in the end of the film really gave it a great colorful edge, and a very fun style. The jokes were, even though politically incorrect and sick, incredibly raunchy and very amusing. It has a great screenplay, and the dialogue wasn't horrible at all. And in all truth, the acting was some of the most believeable I've seen in a long time, and you don't usually find good acting in films such as these. It can be a little raunchy at times, but it just adds to the flair of the film. All in all, this movie is a great date movie, and I can't wait to see what's on the DVD for it!

It's also the kind of movie bound to become a cult favourite. I say it's intriguing even though I'm a straight male. The comedy is about Megan, a cheerleader baffled when her family and friends spring an intervention on her, to address her suspected lesbianism. They have stupid reasons (she's a vegetarian), but it is true she's more interested in the female form than kissing her boyfriend- they're right. Megan is sent to camp designed to cure homosexuals, but falls in love with another girl, Graham.The movie, while cute and colourful with a lot of good points, isn't exactly hilarious as a comedy. There are a few snickers here and there, but nothing major. There's also not a lot of eroticism, in spite of being about lesbianism- that's not what this movie is for. Mainly, it's more of a message movie, espousing values of tolerance, honesty, and love. There's some refuting stereotypes, even though it was stereotypes that led to Megan's family correctly detecting she's gay. On a side note, this movie was also subjected to a ridiculous NC-17 rating, for a scene where Megan masturbates- but it's through her clothes, we see *nothing*. This came the same year American Pie (and its trailer) featured a teenage boy having sex with a pie. The double standard is appalling, evidence of either homophobia or a disgust with female pleasure. Ultimately, this movie fell victim to the old attitudes it's trying to address.

Although Cheerleader gets credit for attacking homosexual conversion therapy eight years earlier, Save Me is a very much better movie in every way.Save Me is both more entertaining and rewarding and MUCH more effective in addressing the therapy fad that claimed to turn gays straight through prayer and therapy but by now (thank God) has been pretty much abandoned even by the fanatics who most strongly pushed it.The humor in Cheerleader is so excessively stupid, relentless and campy that it completely undermines any serious message the movie might be trying to present. It comes across as simply a mindless, pointless, frantic, unfunny mess - like a Jerry Lewis movie, for those who remember him.The head of the conversion camp in both movies is a woman, but the characters are as different as night and day. Judith Light in Save Me is a compassionate person who honestly believes in the work she does and really loves the men who are sent to her for help. Her realization that what she does may NOT actually help, and may instead hurt them, is a far more powerful indictment of the therapy than the gratingly moronic, maniacal, twitching monster Cathy Moriarty plays in Cheerleader.This movie's only assets are three of its actors Natasha Lyonne, who can't help being charming no matter what she does; Clea DuVall, who is so subtly and sultrily sexy that she makes even this gay man drool; and RuPaul - OUT of drag - completely credible in an entirely male role the relatively macho athletic director of the camp, of all things.But the movie is so stupidly written and directed, and the other actors are so bad, that it is not worth watching - unless by lesbians who can identify more easily with these women than the gay men in Save Me. Gay men have a hard enough time finding good movies, but the selection is even worse for lesbians.

Part of this, of course, is because Mink Stole (a regular in Waters films) is in this movie. But most is because of the film's extremely non-subtle and cartoony way of dealing with homosexuality and repression.The film is about a high school girl whose family decides (for totally insane reasons) that she's gay and they surprise her by sending her to a camp that vows to 'straighten her out'. Cathy Moriarty runs the place and uses a wide variety of insane techniques to change the kids' sexual orientations--with silly and predictable results.Some potential viewers would not surprisingly be put off by the pro-gay message--though I really think the people who made this film probably couldn't care less about these folks. However, some folks who would embrace the message might also be put off by the sexual tone of the film. While I strongly disagree with the MPAA's original decision to rate the film NC-17, it is still a film that earns an R rating and is not appropriate for all audiences.

The first few minutes of the film are very visually juicy, as without any dialogue we come to quickly understand that she does not enjoy kissing her boyfriend, and prefers looking up the skirts of her cheerleading squad. Her family and friends suspect that she's a lesbian, and with the help of an ex-gay played by RuPaul, surprise her with an intervention. They send her to a puke-inducingly suburban reparative therapy camp, run by a terrible suburban witch played with great presence by Cathy Moriarty, which employs a five-step program to cure its reluctant campers of their gayness.This straightforwardly satirical but yawningly conventional romantic comedy is not only about sexuality, but also gender and the crassly propagandized pigeonholing of gender roles. But director Jamie Babbit approaches the material with a sleepy variation of the style Jay Roach gave to the original Austin Powers film and leads it to a very weak and anti-climactic rushed ending.Despite its light-heartedly satirical approach, there is a peep of true empathy for those who are put through this psychological and emotional terror. Babbit being a lesbian herself, is, I assume, responsible for these occasional undercurrents, as the script itself is merely a lightweight and obvious satire. Babbit herself hardly transcends the plainness of the send- up. For example, one of the ways in which she emboldens the archaic phoniness of gender roles is by saturating her costumes and sets with bold blues and pinks. It's not a bad touch at all, but the satire could have done better with more subtlety.I disagree with critics who maintained that the categorized portrait of Middle America is over the heads of today's gay teenagers, as I feel the intention was to make a wise jab at the Conservative, 1950s-style American dream social dreg is a inferior, tasteless copy of an ideological mindset. The trite lifestyle the film's caricatured adults insensitively impose upon their kids is pretentious and commercially produced.I love the irony of only realizing you're gay once you're in an anti-gay institution. The way society laughs at this is how kids are sometimes only really confused once they are told they are. When critics of the film have claimed it fails to subvert gay stereotypes by perpetuating them in the effeminate boys in the camp, they are forgetting that the movie is a parody not only of the fanatical religious right but also of the gay community it persecutes. But though the film is misunderstood by some, these stereotypical flaming-queen caricatures do fall flat after awhile, much too two-dimensional.

This has to be one of the most tamest movies to get branded with that rating.  Here in Canada, the uncut version had no problem getting a 14A rating.. so what's the deal?  Are the MPAA homophobes or something? Or do they just hate to see females being immersed in their sexuality?  Either way, they seem to be an old-fashioned group of people.  Anyways.. onto the film review.  The best thing about this movie is the plot, which is pretty original.  I can actually imagine places like True Directions existing somewhere in the world.  One of the problems with the film is that by looking at the poster, and seeing the trailers, you'd think it's a comedy... but it's more of a romantic drama of sorts.  It's still pretty fun, though.  This film is very visual for the most part... the colours (bright pink representing girls, blue for the boys) are emphasized quite a bit.  Natasha Lyonne takes on a role that's fairly different than what she usually plays.  I'm used to seeing Natasha play characters that usually have lots of wit and seem very tough.  Here, she's playing a prissy, soft-spoken, sexually confused teenager and she plays the part well.  Clea Duvall is also a very underrated actress, and she's absolutely perfect in the role of the butchy Graham.  Another interesting thing about the cast is that RuPaul is featured here, out of drag!  Since this movie was down on a tiny budget, I feel that probably due to these limitations, it wasn't as good as it could've been.  It had a truly unique plot and a great cast, but some of the scenes never really took off.  Still, it's better than most of the stuff out there today and it's an excellent piece of social commentary.

Megan's first day at rehab she meets the folks at the rehab house that have already taken the first step in the program Admitting they're a homosexual  Megan is reluctant to admit she has homosexual tendencies but after a short confrontation in front of the group she breaks down, cries and admits I'm a Homo which is a classic scene in itself.  It's nice to see Bud Cort who plays Peter Bloomton (Megan's father).  After Bud Cort got injured\scarred in a car accident many years ago he kind of disappeared for a long while.Megan meets Graham Eaton (Clea DuVall) who likes girls A Lot and really has no desire to change who she it but wants to appease her parents for her trust fund, her parents are blackmailing her over it.  Hilary Vandermuller (Melanie Lynskey) who initially shows Megan around the rehab center is still much attracted to women.  One night Graham decides to sneak out and go to the local gay bar (The Cocksucker) and has several others going with her, Megan is talked into going with them at the last minute.  At the gay bar while Graham is dancing with another girl and starts getting intimate with her is when Megan realizes she is attracted to Graham.The whole setting of the Rehab center revolves on very traditional sexual roles such as the mans role in fixing the car, chopping wood and making the proper male crotch adjustments.  Of course the women's roles in taking care of the baby, vacuuming the house and cooking.  The use of Blue and Pink are used to separate the genders and role playing is part of the course.In the end Megan & Graham find out who they are and come to terms with just being who they are regardless of the consequences, although Megan's father at the end gets help to come to terms of his daughter being homosexual.There is not one single part of the movie that is supposed to be taken seriously and like Sugar & Spice it is just a movie for the fun of it. I really enjoyed this movie and also liked many of the songs.The music in this movie was very upbeat and emotional at times.  It's too bad there was no soundtrack released, I had to spend a pretty penny to get Chick Habit..April March,  Trailer Song..Sissy Bar,  If You Should Try To Kiss Her..Dressy Bessy,  Ray of Sunshine..Go Sailor,  Together Forever In Love..Go Sailor,  Glass Vase, Cello Case..Tattle Tale and then had to compile them on one CD so I could easily hear them in one sitting without using 5 CD's, what a pain.I think this is a very good movie and I enjoyed the music.  Again, some movies you need to go out to your front porch and set your brain out there and come back for it after you have watched the movie.  This is one of those movies that are for entertainment value only.  If you're the kind of person that feels you need to have redeeming qualities or some philosophical meaning or walk away somehow as a better person from the experience and can't check your brain at the door then this movie will not be for you. For us folks who still have that kid inside us that doesn't need constant reasoning, this movie will be fun.  Besides, it can be nice to give the brain a rest once in awhile.

Two things though not exactly related to the movie why isn't there a soundtrack (great music)? And why is it R? It really could've gotten away with a PG-13, but anyway I am so glad that this movie was made.The premise is totally believable, the popular girl who doesn't want to accept her homosexuality, so she just shelves it in the closet of her sub-consious, and is sent to the so-sad-that-places-like-this-really-exist rehabilitaion center True Directions. Now, while some of the characters may be based on stereotypes, they are not all, for example the one really feminine guy could be a stereotype-- but there are some gay people who actually act like that, most don't but some do. Also, I can't see why people would call this entire film a stereotype, the message at the core of this is be who you really are. The film was just hilarious, and most of the things in their I guess people can't get if they haven't been through the experience of growing up in a straight-is-the-only (bs) world. Just hilarious. And everyone is especially good in this movie, especially Natasha Lyonne, who has a TON of talent shown here, and Clea DuVall also.Finishing up, I really liked But I'm A Cheerleader, it's a charming, cute, funny, and realistic film about the lives of some teenagers who are forced to do things like this.

I rediscovered so many feelings I'd suppressed since I first experienced this, in the theatre. I did feel slightly guilty, watching this sort of picture with my partner; feeling my emotion blossom, much like it did back back in those less inhibited days. But, by the end of the movie I was certain sharing this experience was the most precious thing I could've done. The similarities to my own life experiences were painted high, for all to see. Feelings of nausea every time I had to watch two Heteroes kiss. Uneasiness around the male members of the cast. The delight I'd feel watching a group of cheerleaders bouncing around. Warm gooey feelings every time those beautiful young women celebrated their loveliness with a delicate on-screen embrace. The electricity of smooth, smooth, soft, wet kisses. It was too much. Still euphoric from seeing my life flash before my eyes in this dreamy fashion, I seized the moment and informed the wife that I might be a gay lesbian.I'd always dreaded telling her my dark secret, but I was amazed at how easy it was to come clean. I almost felt cheated by her light hearted laughter. Of relief, joy? Wait, did she think I was joking? I told her this face was serious. She only laughed harder. Far more serious than the poker face I might wear on a Friday night to fool the guys into thinking I was one of them. She was near hysterics. Only one course of action could remedy this situation. She was starting to upset me. Just a little. I felt strong and emboldened as I wobbled over to the window, heaved it open, took a fresh breath and aired my secret to the neighbours, I'M a LESBIAN! AND I'M PROUD! There were some adjustments at first, but I can honestly say our relationship is stronger than ever. There's a lot more to being a lesbian than I ever dreamt. It may seem silly, but I can NOT recommend this movie enough. You might be living a lie without even knowing it. "},{"Title":"Congratulations, liars! You know who you are and you know who you want.

I cannot imagine how they could have made the leaders of this group look more ridiculous. The parents portrayed are just plain ignorant. You can't blame them for falling for the canard that sexual orientation is something to be cured. Underneath that story is the pain of the children that are forced into these centers by well-meaning parents. Megan (Natasha Lyonne of American Pie and Scary Movie) has no clue that she is a lesbian. The fact that she is a vegetarian and doesn't like the way her boyfriend kisses is enough for her parents.

Some have criticised Jamie Babbit for being John Waters-lite, which I think is a bit unfair. The movie is what it is, and it's entertaining enough.Natasha Lyonne always shines even in third rate material ('American Pie', 'Detroit Rock City',etc.), but she really suits quirkier and more intelligent vehicles like this one, 'The Slums Of Beverly Hill' and 'Freeway 2'. Pairing her up with the seriously underrated Clea Duvall ('The Faculty' and unfortunately a lot of dross) is an inspired move, and the supporting cast includes cult figures Bud Cort ('Brewster McCloud'), John Waters' regular Mink Stole, and an ironic turn from RuPaul. The wonderful Cathy Moriarty ('Raging Bull') , 'Heavenly Creatures' Melanie Lynskey and a surprising role for Richard Moll ('Night Court' and dozens of z-grade movies) are icing on the cake.

An interesting quirk to the beginning is that the friends and family use these superficial indications to determine that Negan is gay. At this point the writers have us guessing  a little.

There are some subjects, like pregnancy, war crimes, and yes, homosexuality that require a certain amount of skill to handle humorously. This movie lacks that subtlety, trying to do both a social satire and a homosexual parody at the same time. A good satire can most often be watched as a good parody as well if you don't concentrate on the hidden commentary. But intentional parody doesn't really work as a satire and it's a form of humour that you either love or hate. I belong to the latter group, and thus I don't really think that I belong to this film's target audience. It's too bright, too in your face, too exuberantly and stereotypically gay - and not in a fun way. You're painfully reminded that these people, especially the males, could never exists in real life. They're just too over the top, too stereotypical, too clueless about even the most basic of social norms.By far the worst is the rehabilitation center, though, which is painted in the most obnoxious shades of pink and baby blue. The whole process of trying to turn gays and lesbians into straight people by forcing them to adapt the most masculine and feminine roles imaginable is of course ludicrous, though from what I've gathered, not that far from reality, unfortunately. And I think that this over the topness will actually please the friends of parody as it is always treated with tongue in cheek and with certain amount of yeah, we're just kidding. But every now and then the movie takes a turn for the worse and tries to point and mock through the use of satire. It tries to say this is wrong, don't do this, but it feels like it's trying to force the message down our throats. Its message is a good one, don't get me wrong, but its delivery leaves much to be desired.That being said, there are some good things in this film. The acting is mainly rather bland, but the two main characters, Megan (Natasha Lyonne) and Graham (Clea DuVall), have some genuine chemistry between them and you're able to buy their romance. Add in some laughs, which are kind of forced, but laughs nonetheless, and you have a film that has some value as a guilty pleasure.And that pretty nicely sums up the film. It's not a good movie. It simultaneously mocks the gay people and then tries to tell its audience that it's okay to be one, which sends extremely mixed messages. But it is rather funny if its sense of humour tickles your fancy and the main romance is watchable. There are worse films in existence.

The movie pokes fun at many typical clichés and stereotypes associated with gays, but each character (from the Gothic Sinead to Jewish Joel) has something unique about them that makes them lovable.The characters, especially Megan and Graham, develop so much throughout the movie, and the visuals (especially the blues and pinks of True Directions) are eye popping.I'd definitely recommend this, for gays and straights alike, since the story's values (being yourself and loving who you want) can pertain to anyone.

But I can't believe that in the sixties they were so open about sexuality (that were the seventies right?) The music they used in the film was also great they really helped with the movie.

But then, it's comedy, and previews often show all the good bits of a movie to attract to a rather mediocre product. This isn't the case for But I'm a Cheerleader, which is a sweet film laced with black humour and a message.The movie circles around a cheerleader's time at True Directions, a homosexual rehab centre for gay teens. True Directions seeks to straighten out these teens in a five step programme, making them normal. However, perhaps it's not that easy...But I'm A Cheerleader does rely on a few stereotypes in its narratives, but doesn't shy away from twisting those stereotypes for comedic effect. The concept that homosexuality can be driven out of people if they are made to conform to gender roles is shown in all the comedy that such ideas deserve.There are some dark-ish moments in this film, so it may not be as light-on as some people want, while others may complain that it treats a serious subject too simply.

I watched this twice on successive days, feeling disappointed after the first viewing (I had read the first page of reviews). Second time around, I could see more in it some subtle touches (Mary planting the *plastic* flowers and finding one that wouldn't stay planted - very symbolic), and found the bits I laughed at (especially the males drooling over Rock, and the ludicrous ideas of proper masculine/feminine behaviour being presented) still funny.The acting was uniformly good. But whether the characters were entirely believable was another matter. In particular, Mary had evidently managed to get a son from somewhere, but if she was so big on heterosexuality, why did she not have at least a lover (and why did not some cheeky kid point this out)? Of course, there was at least one passage to suggest that she was a suppressed gay herself - and her ideas of masculine and feminine behaviour were so extraordinary that they would have seemed unnecessarily prescriptive even in the Fifties. There is another major inconsistency if she is so insistent on 'proper' male-female roles, which seems to include the man being the one with the job, why is she running a business and not confining herself to the kitchen etc.?Graham's motivation was not wholly clear was she simply desperate to please a notably unpleasant and manipulative father? And if Megan's parents love her so much, why are they, especially her mother, so fast to state that they will disown her completely if she cannot decide not to be a lesbian? And why are her friends so ready to turn her in, and take the line that her boyfriend's appallingly sloppy kissing should please her? It is my understanding (as a Brit) that poor kissing technique is frowned on in high school circles, and I can see why any girl would have disliked this! There was an element of parody that went so far that it stretched credulity to breaking point. Could anyone *really* believe that vegetarianism was a sign of homosexuality ... when probably at least half the massive population of India, for example, is vegetarian? Or that one's mother getting married in pants, or being born in France, was a *sufficient* root for homosexual behaviour? (Mind, American antagonism to France being what it is in some conservative quarters ...) Further, there is some reference to God and the religious importance of a heterosexual lifestyle, but my understanding is that this is a *major* part of the teaching pushed by these institutions that attempt to 'cure' homosexuals (and apparently of Mary's own motivation), so we should have heard a lot more about this Other elements of the presentation, such as the attempt to present a gay lifestyle as luridly self-destructive, to suggest that gays 'recruit' (and liberals promote this), have no friends, etc. sound truer to life.There was also a tendency to make use of the stereotypes that the message of the film surely deplores. So André the actor and dancer has to be a 'cissy' (indeed, all the gay boys are made to run away when the axehead flies off the handle), and Megan is the child of a more dominant mother, who will say things her somewhat ineffectual husband can't get out - until a final scene after the credits have begun.This is a reminder that one would like to have known more about the parents. E.g. why does Graham have a boy's name? Did her father really want a son? The film is quite short, but I think it could have been improved by adding a little to fill in this part of the background more and answer some of these questions. I am still ready to give it a mark of 7.

Steven Spielberg makes epic productions, and sometimes they're pretty good. BIAC is a small film, made on a smaller-than-epic budget, with a limited scope (to fit the budget, probably) and a limited cast of characters, and it didn't have much of a big-screen play. As a teenage humor/angst film, it's one of dozens and dozens, some perhaps better done. Coming of age doesn't really fit - and it too perhaps has been done better. As a biting satire of our culture's view of homosexuality, well that's been done before - and perhaps better. As a satire of our culture's view of anyone different, there have been others, but probably not many as well done as this.But as a scathing satire on our culture's more insidious, cruel, and hidden, penchant to educate, change, and purify those who are different (as we did to the American Indian children when we forbade them their own language, dress, hair styles, and names), there have been precious few movies as effective as But I'm a Cheerleader. (SPOILER) No editorial emphasis was necessary for the simple scene when the young man was put into solitary exile in a doll house for getting caught kissing another boy. For anyone with eyes wide open, that scene carried a tremendous emotional impact.(SPOILER)Megan, Natasha Lyonne, tried to repent her ways she did all the proper exercises with the proper attitude - at the start. But gradually the true basic strength of her character evolved. (SPOILER) In the end, her character proved stronger than her sardonic, worldly wise friend Graham, Cleo DuVall. So not only was this movie a pertinent and effective satire, on a dramatic level it was additionally an outstanding story of the evolution of a very complex and profound character.Kudos to the director, Jamie Babbit, and to the superb ensemble cast for bringing the story together - and especially to Natasha Lyonne and Clea DuVall for bringing life and value to two very likeable characters.

It's EXACTLY the great kind of movie that everyone says they'd love to find-- it is original, inventive, joyful, funny, warm and loving. It is also meaningful, without any kind of message of heaviness. Nothing in it is p.c. or otherwise someone else's value system imposed on the audience. The characters in it relate to real life. You find out right away that the theme involves gay kids, and pressure to conform. Ordinarily, I'd RUN from such a social issue topic. But this was delightfully funny, open-feeling, fresh. Odd to say all that, but that's how it felt.I'm not gay, nor do I share some of my university colleagues' obsession with political correctness. But as a person who tries to be a good neighbor, a good citizen, and a compassionate person, I am basically friendly to outgroups and folks who don't fit in with the mainstream. But I was a bit surprised at how inoffensive and fun this whole gay themed movie was, and how quickly and thoroughly I got into it. I loved it!!! It's a great movie. It's hilarious, it's insightful. Since I KNOW you are pining away for just such a movie treasure, please go and find it somewhere in your area, and take a date.You have no right to complain anymore about all the vapid Hollywood summer special effects movies, action movies, and box-office-big-hit dreck, unless you put in the effort to track this masterpiece down and support it by buying tickets. You asked for it, now go and get it! You'll want to buy the video later, I promise. I gave this a well deserved 10 out of 10.

But there was something grabbing about this film, something almost rewarding, it's a little bit lighter, a little bit darker, a little bit more twisted and a little bit more heartfelt than Pumpkin. I think the major cause for difference was how the subject matter was approached. In Pumpkin we delve into issues that are looked down upon in our times though the satirical look of a cheesy, early 60's backdrop where after school specials reigned supreme with the high school crowd. But the development of reason were to be cruel and misguided though out the entire film, leaving it laugh less and uncomfortable with even itself. It is the same premise with But I'm A Cheerlead. This film is a comedy but yet it doesn't feel the need to have a joke, it doesn't go out of its way to be funny and it doesn't stoop below the barrier to be over-the-top. Sure it is a wild ride and will be hard to stomach for some not willing to except its angle on things, but yet it is ironic that the most fulfilling and rewarding comedies of 1999 is based around a homosexual bond. This is the tale of a girl named Megan. She is a popular cheerleader with a hunk of a boyfriend. She comes form a religious family and is living her life in what she perceives to be normal. But her existence begins to coexist with her state of mind; she is living the life she wants to, while everyone is telling her she isn't allowed to live with such delusions. She questions her friends, she questions her parents, she realizes her actions and then she questions herself. So one day she comes home to find a room full of her friends sitting in a circle with RuPaul Charles in a `straight is great' t-shirt. He is a counsellor for a H.A. (Homosexual Anonymous) program. Megan is then shipped off to a place where girls wear pink and boys wear blue, told that if she doesn't graduate she is not welcome back home. Here Megan meets characters of all different shapes and sizes, funny for what they are and not what they intend to be. Megan is taught that men need to play football and fix cars, acknowledge the large statue of the wrench during the car-fixing scene, and girls look after the children and clean the house. But instead of finding divine intervention, Megan is finding love at her camp. She beings to feel for Graham, a disgruntled youth with a socially inadmissible father who believes the reason for her homosexuality is because `my mother got married in pants.' There are all sorts of little hidden quirks to this film that are just as fun to find as they are to view, even the casting of the film is of a certain nature. We see Melanie Lynskey from Heavenly Creatures and Clea DuVall, you know, that girl from the Facility that everyone called a lesbian. But all fun and games aside, the true reward of this film is that it doesn't try to force things upon you and toy with your own personal opinions. This is not a film about how it is funny to be gay; it is a study of how it is funny to not be yourself. This film has a message and it is pronounced loud and clear, be yourself, don't let anyone try to tell you who to be. Because in the end won't you be happier being who you want to be as apposed to what people assume you are? This film isn't offbeat like Pumpkin, it is not a walking joke with a missed punch line and a fictional motive, this film is touching and rewarding in its honesty. The only thing that makes this film half a point short of a perfect score is that it does become a tad out of line towards the ending. The honest scenes collide with the goofy ones without time to breathe or think; leading the viewer feeling vaguely jerked around. As you know with almost all films it is hard to mix the comedic aspects with the touching ones, having a head on collision of neutral feeling, that is neither funny nor emotive. This film works entirely on both levels because it knows enough not to take its circumstances seriously but treat life as a serious article. Some people will claim that this film is mean, most of the comedy is based on stereotyping. Some people will claim that this film is nothing more than a shame or a shtick with a relatable gimmick. And maybe those people are right. Maybe films about finding yourself in a sexual identity crisis should be left to films willing to commit to their surroundings, like Boy's Don't Cry. But I must ask, how can you find all aspects of yourself when you can't divulge in your misguided tendencies? I have not talked fully about characters from this film, and to this point I still feel no need to. Because this is not a film about its characters and their certain assets, there is not feeling for need of such description. That would be placing the focal point on a misdirected premise. The key to this films intrigue is the false universe they exists in, in which they are told how they should be if they wish to be accepted. This film was written by Brian Wayne Peterson who has crafted a screenplay that this clever without being obnoxious and is reality based without becomes self-parody. The direction by Jamie Babbit is probably what gives the film its bite. The director sets the story in what appears to be late 50's early 60's where the character where tacky skits and the camp director looks almost one with Fay Dunaway. The direction is subtle in its method, yet over-the-top in its execution, a tactic rarely seen in comedy these days. This film may not have got big box office credits or even many positive reviews, but in a world of spoon fed comedy and blundering, one-off sight gags, a film that relies on wit and is willing to weigh itself just as much on what the audience doesn't see as to what it has handed to it is truly note worthy of ones praise. It's a film that will not be appreciated by all, but it is one that is willing to take risks and push itself across the boarders that films today are afraid to even mention, making it a great comedy with its heart in the right place, I think.

I also liked Clayton, I felt bad when he got locked in that little house. He was pretty cute...wait, that's off-topic, sorry.But the ending was kind of...bad.

Not to mention just the general running-away ending was pretty cheesy. Disappointing, after such a great start to the movie.The surface and the general meaning of the movie was cute, but it had a cheesy feel to it. It just...did. It wasn't...I don't know. Deep, I guess. It didn't have a real plot, once you got past I-still-can't-remember-her-name's first step. The heartbreak-and-getting-back-together at the end was something you could see a mile away, and there wasn't any suspense at all.In general, I only watched it because it had a good beginning and title (as I said before), and to see guys making out. Which is really weird because I'm a girl who likes pairing guys with guys and still thinks guys are hot.

OK all-American refugee-from-the-'50's cheeleader is suspected of being gay and after a cliché intervention is sent off to a wacky deprogramming house that claims to turn gay youth straight.

Hijinks ensue as the kids alternately play along or subvert the program. The romance we all saw coming a mile off happens and there's a happy ending. It's a mess. I wish the character were at least cliché but they're just incomplete. The plot makes no sense, characters walk in from nowhere, sub-plots feel like they're left over from what was hacked out & left on the editing room floor.

It's the most stupid thing I've seen since, I dunno, Combat Academy  All that I'm glad about is that I downloaded this piece of crap rather than going to see or hiring it. Gay people (I think) could do without this kind of patronisation. Don't get me wrong, I'm not in the least bit gay but this kind of rubbish makes me feel sorry for those that are.

It's a satire on the behavior of those who try and change others instead of accepting differences. I was pleased with the way the movie played out.Everyone, EVERYONE, in this movie did an awesome job. From the top of the list to the bottom unknowns, they handled their parts well, injected tons of energy and the sexual confusions developed into sexual maturity.Good movie. Parents of gay, lesbian or bi-sexual teens should watch this movie to learn how to NOT deal with their child. I was almost angered by the adult roles in this movie, not because of the actors, but because of the parents over the years that I have met and dealt with who were truly this outrageous.

And a few parts of it achieve the first two.But virtually all of the supporting characters are NOTHING but stereotypes. All gay men are effeminate, all effeminate men are gay, all lesbians are ... you get the idea. And while perhaps that can be partly excused due to the intended campy feel of the film, it was annoying.I was definitely very disappointed in the quality of the script. I had expected something similar to Saved! (which I love), but it's like the high school film class attempt at it.Even so it's a mildly amusing film that did redeem itself somewhat in the ending. Rent it if you're short list of films is finished, but you might end up watching chunks of it on fast forward like I did.

Its about a family trying to de-gay their daughter... so they send her to a camp that turns gays back. This movie is about accepting yourself for who you are and accept the different people around you. It is very good, but it may be a little offensive... because the issue of parents no accepting their kids is a very important thing to act on because it is very serious but this movie turns that into making it funny... so to enjoy this movie you will need to just dig deep and understand that it is not trying to be offensive. When I first started watching it I was offended but it is meant to be satirical so I realized that I should actually be laughing. I think it is hilarious because in it, the camp that is, everything is perfect. Everything is clean and tidy and everyone is the same. Its like the camp teachers or whatever are trying to make everyone and these kids perfect. all the girls wear pink and the guys wear blue and are made to fit a certain gender. This movie is Hilarious, but if you dig deep I think it is very touching.

I just felt so bad for the girl at first, because her sexual preferences were totally against everything she was about. I was glad to see that her and Graham got to stay together at the end. It was actually really sweet. Still, the idea of a camp like this one is extremely scary. I couldn't even imagine what life would be like if these kinds of rehabilitation camps existed today. It really opened my eyes to what gays and lesbians would have to do to cover up their sexuality in earlier centuries. I enjoyed this movie very much also because they didn't make the love scenes totally disgusting and inappropriate.

This movie is an attempt to slam group homes that force homosexual teens into becoming straight, which fails dismally due to it's ridiculous stereotyping of both heterosexuals and homosexuals. Without the 1990's cultural references, this movie looks like it could've been made in the late-1960's or early-1970's. One reason people suspect that heroine Megan Bloomfield(Natasha Lyonne) is a lesbian is because she's a fan of Melissa Ethridge! Oh, no! I listen to David Bowie, The Smiths, Morrissey and Imperial Teen. Is that supposed to mean I'm gay too? I think not! Even real-life places like True Directions couldn't be that unwilling to accept the notion of women in the workplace(I hope!). In one scene the counselor Mike(RuPaul) threatens to force his male inmates to watch sports all day if he catches them looking at other men. Some punishment A bunch of sweaty football players smacking each other on the rear end after a good play?! Sure, they'll be horrified--NOT! A big surprise is not only seeing Robert Pine(CHiPs) playing as Graham's father, but Richard Moll(Night Court) as part of a two man team who rescues kids from the home and allows them to accept and explore their true sexuality. Perhaps there are a few people who think those who don't like this movie are homophobic, but you don't have to be a homophobe to hate this one. I may be straight, but I can't imagine how any homosexuals could find this uplifiting in any way, shape, or form.By the way, the cheer scene where Megan(Natasha Lyonne) declares her love for Graham(Clea DuVall) at graduation sucks too.

But I'm a Cheerleader is ample proof of that. The premise is solid, the idea is good, it just comes off as a college level skit rather than a full production movie.  That is not to say that some of the scenes aren't hilarious. RuPaul as a man is almost enough for some to watch it, but it is Clea DuVal as Graham that steals the show. When she is on screen acting is done, when she is on screen with Natasha Lyonne, the cheerleader, sizzle and smoke happen, there is chemistry.This is DuVal's picture otherwise the characters, especially the males are broadly drawn charicatures.Is it worth the price of rental? Get a bottle of wine and a few friends and have a party. Play spot the cliche. Root for love and have a ball.

It's just that there was such potential for it to be more than what it ended up being.The acting and directing was good, although both could of used a bit more energy. If a filmmaker wants us to laugh along, they have to be in a good mood, and it's hard to tell exactly what mood people were in as they shot this.There are moments of genuine humor. The first half has some especially funny bits, but they're just bits, and they don't add up to a whole. The two major problems with the film seem to be the script, which is never fully realized, and the visual direction, especially from the Director of Photography.But I'm A Cheerleader didn't focus in on what it was trying to say and exactly how it should be said. It seemed to want more scenes taking it deeper. We only get the surface of things, and this topic deserves an in depth treatment. There is greater potential for humor and drama, but it is given a tepid treatment.The production design is quite campy, but visually not much more than a one-note gag. And the photography is very muddy and not as sharp as it should be. Lighting and framing make a huge difference, albeit subtle to the untrained eye.I say, give it more effort next time all around! But try again, you've caught my attention!

I though at least they would have some models, or something like that, to save the movie, but I was wrong also there. OK, they put in some good jokes, but the movie wont survive only because of that.

It was vaguely satirical, but just seemed to be missing humour.

So they put all the lesbians together in a dormitory room...ha ha? No. There was potential, but none of the jokes really turned into anything. The cast are all good actors, but they can only be as good as the writing. Overall I found myself very dissatisfied with this film.

Painfully slow, clumsy and utterly baffling in places, I don't know who this would appeal to, I cannot believe it won two awards, the only good bit is the opening soundtrack by Ru Paul (who also appears in this disaster).

It's really quite a foolish little movie, full of gays and ex-gays and ex-ex-gays, and gays pretending to be ex-gays.Stereotypes abound (presumably they are deliberately exaggerated.) Gays and lesbians are really, really gay and lesbian, and Christians come across as ridiculous homophobic bigots. In the end, of course, (spoiler ahead!) we discover that being gay is perfectly normal and Graham (Clea DuVall) and Megan ride off together to live happily ever after.The thing comes across as propaganda of some kind, but propaganda generally makes someone look good.

It takes a funny premise (a straight girl is sent to a camp for gays by her parents and friends who suspect that she's gay, even though she denies it) and then destroys that funny premise by making her discover that she really is gay. It then becomes tedious to watch.The performances are over the top, and it was made on the cheap, as evidenced by the low budget sets. But the real fault is with the script. They could have written something funny, but instead opted to get on a soapbox.

I was at my sister's house, and brother of my sister's dropped it off in-front of his computer un-opened, and my 12 year old niece found the movie, and I took it away, and told her she could'nt watch it, and confronted my sister about it, and she said herself and husband had rented it on VHS the night before, and watched it while their 2 daughters (12 and 9) were asleep, and son (4) was alseep.I knew little about the movie, and watched it at my house, and found the subject matter very unsuitable for childern under 17, cause anybody under that age would be confused, influenced, and be curious about two girls kissing in the three make-out scenes, and the language about gays.I told my sister that I would'nt want my nieces to view this movie, at a young age, way before they reach puberty, and discover boys. I don't hate gays or anything, but I just think this movie would totally confuse young childern, don't you agree.I'm Hetro, and I love girls...it was a good funny movie, and it's hard to believe a movie with this subject matter would be greenlighted, with a title which some young boys & girls would think is about Cheerleadering, and football guys, parties, and stuff...well later all.-Raving Maniac "},{"Title":"Off the mark","Date":"19 May 2001","Score":"6 out of 25 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  Probably an attempt at satire, this film misses the mark and comes off as poorly-made homosexual propaganda.
