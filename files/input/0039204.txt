[{"Title":"More A Human Interest Story Than A Boxing Tale","Date":"9 October 2005","Score":"30 out of 33 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Film-Noir, Sport","Review":" I looked at this as simply a good story, a solid drama that happened to have the sport of boxing figure into it. Boxing movies. if people insist on labeling this under that category, were particularly popular around the time of this film. Many of them had similar stories about a good guy being told to take a dive or else. Yes, that was in here, too, but it wasn't anywhere near the central part of the story. This film was more of an earlier Raging Bull-type tale in that it concentrated on the friends, family, freeloaders, criminals and women surrounding the main male character. This was more of a story about a decent man who gets carried away with success and with the power and money that goes with it. As good as the lead actor, John Garfield, was in here - and he was good - I was more intrigued with the supporting characters. Lilly Palmer looked and sounded the part of a refined sweet, pretty French girl (whatever that means) and was a good contrast to the uneducated and quick tempered brute (Garfield). As in so many stories, she wasn't fully appreciated by her man until the end. Anne Revere, as Garfield's mom (she seemed to always play the lead character's mother in 1940s films) was fascinating as she always was and kudos to Joseph Peveny as Shorty and Lloyd Gough a Roberts. Both added a lot to the film. Wlliam Conrad and Hazel Brooks added some great film noir-- type dialog, berating each other once in a while.These actors, and the photography of James Wong Howe, make this a cut above most if not all the so-called boxing films.

It practically predicts the course of his career and the world of sports cinema, specifically boxing films. Robert Rossen's 1947 black and white boiler is clearly an influence on ROCKY and RAGING BULL, along with countless other rags-to-riches sports stories with a hint of corruption.  John Garfield, an actor I feel serves an audience more with his mere screen presence than his acting skills, is stunning as Charley Davis, the kid from New York who wants a shot at the title.Notice Garfield's prudent girlfriend.  Remind you of Adrian? (ROCKY)  How about the mob boss who wants 50 percent of Garfield's winnings?  Remind you of Nicholas Colasanto from RAGING BULL? Of course.  BODY AND SOUL is the altar of origin from which these films worshiped.  Garfield dabbled in boxing off-screen until his untimely death in 1952 and appears like LaMotta, or De Niro, in many scenes.  His temper can fly quickly and without warning. CHAMPION with Kirk Douglas and SOMEBODY UP THERE LIKES ME with Paul Newman have taken some licks from this sensational film that roared like most of the best films of the 1940's.Boxing is the ultimate sport to depict in film because such interesting character studies can come out of them.  A boxer is, for the most part, alone.  Other sport films seem to suffer because more has to be captured and the sport itself is usually portrayed poorly and unrealistic.  Boxing takes place in a small ring, as does the life of most boxers (or so it seems). Director Robert Rossen is also a master at creating pictures where a flawed main character creates his own suffering and pain and has a fundamental misunderstanding of women.  Just see Broderick Crawford in ALL THE KING'S MEN or Paul Newman in THE HUSTLER.No fight scene captures your attention until the pivotal final championship defense by Charley Davis.  Will he throw it for the easy bucks or win it for pride and the adulation of his simple New York roots?  It is very unapparent and hard to see coming.  The authenticity of the climactic fight is made all the more powerful with its newsreel look and in-your-face photography and makeup.  Credit cinematographer James Wong Howe for the realistic look and credit the blood and sweat of Garfield, writer Abraham Polonsky, and director Rossen to bring such a captivating story of corruption and glory to the screen.

Here, Garfield plays Charlie Davis, a brooding, moody, cynical, angry young man traumatized by his father's untimely and violent death and determined to literally fight his way out of poverty, no matter what it takes. Yet, Charlie Davis is likable, for despite the hardened exterior, he is still fundamentally a good man who is struggling to do what is right despite the pressure to cave in to those who merely want to use him. And although Charlie weakens, he never breaks, and when put to the test, his basic honesty and strength shine through, which makes him a hero and which transforms this movie from just another boxing movie into a true cinematic classic.

Garfield is supported here by Lilli Palmer, Anne Revere, Hazel Brooks, William Conrad, Canada Lee and Lloyd Gough.American filmmakers love boxing movies, and why not? It's a one on one brutal action sport that has inherent in it good drama because of what is at stake for people who most likely came from nothing and used their fists on the street. Body and Soul is no different in this regard, but it's one of the best of its kind. It also boasts an unusual and exceptionally talented cast.The film is loaded with conflict for Charlie Davis (Garfield) - his mother (Revere) doesn't want him to fight; he's in love with Peg (Palmer) and wants to marry her but is talked into delaying it when he signs on with a new and corrupt promoter, Roberts (Gough). This will be the first of Charlie's concessions and unfortunately not the last. He fights Ben (Lee), but isn't told that the man has a blood clot and he needs to coast through only a few rounds. Instead, he pulverizes Ben, causing further brain damage, and takes him on as a trainer out of guilt. Then he's seduced by a money-hungry babe named Alice (Brooks). And on and on, until Roberts bets against him and orders him to take a dive in the championship fight he's been waiting for. (With all the films done about taking dives, anyone who bets on a fight is nuts.) Something about this movie - maybe it's the theme song, which is one of my favorites - swept me away. It's one of Garfield' most colorful performances, and the beautiful, classy Palmer is a perfect juxtaposition not only to the streetwise Charlie but the trashy Alice.The truly transcendent role and performance is essayed by Canada Lee, a wonderful actor who died too young and had too few opportunities in film. His performance as the volatile, ill Ben was Oscar-worthy. Like Ben Carter in Crash Dive, the fact that Lee is black does not enter into the script at all, and he is treated as an equal. For all the rotten stereotyping done in films at that time, there were a few scripts that defied it. Lee was blacklisted and died in 1952 (the same year that John Garfield died), at 45, almost literally of a broken heart. He left a legacy of five films and some wonderful stage work, including Orson Welles' all-black Macbeth. Cast members Garfield, Lee, Anne Revere, Lloyd Gough, Art Smith, Shimen Ruskin, scriptwriter Abraham Polonsky and producer Bob Roberts would all find themselves blacklisted, and director Rossen would be threatened but admit to being a Communist and name names.Magnificently photographed in black and white by James Wong Howe and with top direction, Body and Soul is an example of how wonderful film can be.

He certainly didn't take any artistic chances because the role of Charlie Davis, the Jewish middleweight boxing champion from the Lower East Side of New York was something Garfield could identify with. He'd played a fighter in his second film, They Made Me A Criminal to great acclaim. And he'd appeared in the original production of Golden Boy though not in the lead. He'd be doing that on stage at the time of his demise in 1952.But while Body and Soul didn't blaze any artistic trails for Garfield, it did give him a great role that earned him a second Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. Garfield lost to Ronald Colman that year in A Double Life.Garfield has the feel for the heart and soul of Davis because that was his background. Another reviewer suggested that the Davis character is based on the famous lightweight champion Benny Leonard who would have been a hero to a Jewish kid like Julius Garfinkle growing up first on the Lower East Side and then in the Bronx. Leonard also died around the time Body and Soul was being made and movie audiences would have known that and the film would have a special poignancy for them.The story is told in flashback as Charlie Davis dozes off in the training room before a defense of his middleweight crown. He's in a depression about the death of someone named Ben. Ben turns out to be Canada Lee former champion himself who was Garfield's trainer. We see how Garfield who at first listened to his mother Anne Revere not to fight, but then when father Art Smith dies, economics forces him into the ring. Garfield gets involved with two women, artist Lilli Palmer and nightclub singer Hazel Brooks. He also gets involved with a manager who eventually turns on him in William Conrad and a sleazy promoter in Lloyd Gough. If you're a fan of boxing films I think you can figure out where this will all end up.But the ride is a good one. Besides Garfield's nomination, Body and Soul got another Oscar nomination for Original Screenplay by Abraham Polonsky. And it won the Oscar that year for Best Film Editing. That's for the great work in that department during that final boxing match.For fans of John Garfield, Body and Soul is a must. Besides all that there's that great Johnny Green-Edward Heyman song from the Thirties that got a revival because of this film.

It helps that it was written by Abraham Polonsky whose script is suitably cynical and hard-boiled. John Garfield is the pugnacious fighter easily swayed by the prospects of easy money and not adverse to taking a dive. It's a fine, hard-nosed performance. Garfield was always at his best in roles that required him to battle with his conscience.The whole movie is well cast. The under-rated Lilli Palmer is fine as the 'nice' girl who loves him as is Hazel Brooks as the 'bad' girl who seduces him while the villains are ably taken care of by Lloyd Gough and William Conrad. Best of all there is Anne Revere as Garfield's mother. (Did Revere play everybody's mother movies?). It's another of her no-nonsense roles. Revere was one tough cookie who kept her heart of gold well-hidden. The climatic fight scene is very well staged and Robert Parrish and Frances Lyon's editing won the Oscar while James Wong Howe's cinematography adds considerably to the realism.

Where Chaplin is black, his race is never mentioned, and is never even made an issue.  There's no assumption of deferrence to the white characters.  He is treated as an equal, which, especially for 1947, is an amazing breakthrough.The other strengths of the movie, particularly Garfield's performance and James Wong Howe's cinematography, have been duly mentioned in other posts.

Mom to Gregory Peck in Gentleman's Agreement, Linda Darnell's mother in Forever Amber,Montgomery Clift's mom in A Place in the Sun and Jennifer Jones'mother in The Song of Bernadette. To me, Miss Revere, who was a descendant from Paul Revere, delivers a memorable line in the movie. To paraphrase, she states I want you to be respected. I want you to be a teacher. Sure, in 1947, the teaching profession was looked up to-to use a pun, it was revered. Unfortunately, this great line has been overshadowed by the line, Everybody dies. Must we always be true to life?A hard-nosed, gripping film dealing not only with human emotions, but the fighting ring as well along with its corruption. A film exhibiting one wallop of a punch.

Body and Soul is highly thought of by a lot of writers whose opinions I respect, but it hasn't been seen very often on TV and I was looking forward to viewing it for the first time. John Garfield, a man of some principle in real life, has never impressed me as a first-rate actor although you can't help admiring a kid who grew up in a tough working-class New York neighborhood and made it. He seems to specialize in being shot through glass windows trying to woo some good-looking babe. Such scenes occur in Destination Tokyo, The Postman Always Rings Twice, and here too. He plays an uncultured kid from a poor family in New York. His kindly father dies when thugs bomb the speakeasy next door to his candy shop. Mom is destitute, and Garfield takes up pro boxing for the money. He meets Lili Palmer, a beautiful and appealing if lightweight actress, and takes her home to meet his Mamma. There follows one of those rather familiar scenes in which the Jewish mamma grills the Shiksa over the dinner table, as in Lenny, No Way to Treat a Lady, and so forth. You can gather the plot isn't what could be called novel, but it engages one's interest nonetheless.Garfield proves to be a good fighter and soon begins his rise to the top, assisted by his boyhood friend, Shorty, who is sensitive, good humored, and has a charming smile. Garfield then begins to drown in an excess of tsuris.He is taken over by corrupt gamblers, the equivalent of George C. Scott in The Hustler. Shorty objects. There is an argument and a fight and Shorty is run over accidentally on purpose. Lili Palmer realizes how corrupt he is becoming and gives him a choice the fight game or her. The next thing we know, Garfield is cavorting with some cover girl who has a penchant for mink. (After mink, comes sable.) Garfield unwittingly bashes in the head of a crippled fighter (Canada Lee)the way the Argentinian Firpo does in The Harder They Fall. Garfield agrees to throw a tough fight to make a lot of money so he can quit the ring and marry Lili. The supporting cast is pretty good, especially William Conrad with his impressive baritone. Anne Revere, who specializes in rigidity, whether good or bad, is unusually expressive. Garfield's final fight is murderous. Does he actually throw it? I will leave you burning with curiosity. The direction by Robert Rosson is adequate but he got better with time. Abraham Polonsky's script is okay too. Maybe some of these now-familiar scenes weren't quite as familiar in 1947 as they've since become. Polonsky, Revere, and Garfield all got into trouble during the McCarthy period, and it's hard to see why. If this is an example of communist propaganda you've got to have second sight to find it. Yes, Garfield's family is poor. (Is that what propaganda is?) Whose family wasn't poor during the depression? The streets and furnishings are pretty seedy, but more realistic after all than the white telephones and deco apartments of Fred and Ginger wearing tuxedos and ballroom gowns. Body and Soul compares only vaguely to Golden Boy, I gather, not having seen the latter, but it invites comparison with Champion, which appeared a year or two later. Champion is probably the better film, even if it follows an almost identical formula. There isn't anything here as subtle as Douglas returning to his estranged wife, striking a match for her, and seeing her glance up at him in wary, furtive, and wholly unconscious invitation while she puffs from the flame. At the same time this film uses some nice symbolism. In his New York apartment, his first expensive digs, Garfield has a secret revolving wall. One side is bedecked with flowers and hung with a portrait of the virtuous Lili. The other side is a bar with a sink and everything! and it has anything you want, bourbon, everything, like a candy store. It's practically Dr. Jeykll's flowers and Mr. Hyde's bar.Body and Soul is definitely worth seeing, partly because it's pretty good and partly for its historic value.

He had made many films with them, but wanted to be more independent. In this film, Garfield plays Charley Davis, a lower middle class New Yorker with a talent for boxing. Not unlike many boxers, certainly of that time period, using your fists for sport was a way out of your meager background. While I have never been a big fan of John Garfield and did not consider him a top notch actor of the golden age of Hollywood, this part does seem made for him. Garfield is quite good here, playing the conflicted Charley with skill and credibility. There are actually few real boxing scenes in the film, except for the end, and that is why labeling this as a 'boxing movie' seems a bit deceptive. There are capable supporting players, including the lovely Lili Palmer, who loves Charley. Robert Conrad and Lloyd Gough ably play the tough guy thugs who want Charley to sell his soul for money. A notable performance by African-American actor Canada Lee is striking - considering this is 1947 and is treated as an equal by the white actors. Garfield was known for his politically liberal views, and perhaps this is why he later ended up as an enemy of the Communist witch hunters in Washington. Garfield's untimely death at age 39 was a shock to many - his funeral was mobbed by thousands. Perhaps this elevated his image above the work he left behind in film - but still, this film and a handful of others are quite good.

It is the boxing movie on which all other boxing movies have drawn elements from ever since- the poor kid made good by his talent for boxing yet who is exploited by corrupt fight managers and his own material greed, the faithful girlfriend/wife out of the ring, the scenes showing the lure of riches and the moral decay it brings.The film opens with Garfield waking from a troubled dream, calling out for Ben!. In the middle of the night he rushes to his mother's (Ann Revere) apartment where his faithful girlfriend Lilli Palmer burst into tears upon seeing him. Revere tells Garfield to go. We soon find out, through flashback, just what has happened to Garfield and his body has been used at the expense of his soul.While the film may seem formulaic now...let's remember it started the boxing formula! Great performances all round. Garfield is intense and charismatic, Palmer is sympathetic and warm yet also keenly intelligent and aware and Canada Lee gets a striking role as Ben, the role being a major move forward for the portrayal of African-Americans on-screen. The film is well-written (Polonsky would make the excellent Force Of Evil with Garfield in the following year) and contains many memorable scenes, and the editing in that final fight scene is top-notch. Compulsive and compulsory viewing.

Leonard's closeness to his mother was played up in the sporting press of the time. She wanted her son to play the violin, not box. Leonard reminded her in telegrams after each victory that he was bringing home the bacon--earning far more with his fists than he ever could as a fiddler. Sadly, Leonard lost all his money in the stock market crash and was forced to make an ill- advised comeback. When he retired as a boxer for keeps, he was given referee work. After officiating at six bouts on a hot New York night, Leonard suffered a heart attack and died in the ring.By today's standards this picture is oversentimental, lacking in subtlety and full of clichés. What hoists it is the gritty intensity of John Garfield. Due in large part to his early death, John Garfield's movies enjoy a cult following which time has not diminished. Garfield's pictures, even back in the 'thirties, often included black actors. This was unusual for the time, marking him out as politically liberal and perhaps helping make him a target for congressional red-baiters.

This is not inappropriate, since the focus is on Charley Davis' (Garfield) struggles outside the arena, both to win the woman he loves and against the mobster who wants to control him.

Not because it's a good movie about the fight business &#150; which it is &#150; but because it is, of them all, the only one that uses the story as a blatant metaphor for the sham of the American Dream (although Bogie's effort in The Harder They Fall touches upon that idea).The story is straight-forward Garfield does Garfield playing Davis, the amateur boxer who gains the eye of a professional coach, Quinn (William Conrad) who gradually brings his protégé along to the professional circuit and thence under the influence of those who control the business, notably the sleazy Roberts (Lloyd Goff). Thereafter, Davis is but a mere puppet for the Mob doing his thing in the ring and making only 50% for his efforts.Naturally, Davis's girl, Peg (Lili Palmer), his buddy, Shorty (Joseph Pevney), his mother Anna (Anne Revere) and others all try to dissuade Davis from staying in the business which is rotten to the core, as everyone knows. But he makes it to the top Champion of the World! And, he's got all the trappings of success fast cars, fast women, fast booze, fast times &#150; the sweet life, or so he thinks. So why give up what he's worked so hard to achieve? As Davis moans to Peg, who's urging him to retire, But I'm the Champ!. And Peg replies, No, Roberts is the Champ... She could have said, No, you're the Chump! but that might have been a bit too much self-reflective angst for audiences of that day...Nevertheless, throughout the story, Davis is made to look like a prize chump as he keeps ignoring how he's being treated by the Roberts of the world, all of who are bleeding him white (no pun intended) &#150; and, in the finale, to the point of forcing Davis to take a dive in his last bout and retire rich. Does he do it or does he redeem his honor? I'll let you see the movie...Garfield does a solid job in the role of Davis, but I was more impressed with Pevney's role as Shorty as Davis's alter ego, he does an admirable turn without being maudlin or sanctimonious. The direction from Robert Rossen and filming from James Wong Howe are very good, as is the editing from Robert Parrish, as you would expect anyway.I'm glad I got around to this one, as I do recommend it.

Turning pro Charlie runs up a string of 21 wins in the ring and Roberts the top matchmaker in the state sets up a match between Charlie and the champ Ben Chaplin, Canada Lee, for the title. Ben has a dangerous blood clot in his brain and his manager wants Charlie to be told to go easy with Ben in the fight. Roberts doesn't tell Charlie of Ben's condition and in the championship fight Charlie hits Ben with a number of hard shots to the head that leaves Ben on the mat unconscious. Shocked after the fight to find out that Ben was in no condition to fight Charlie feels that his title, in knocking the already brain-damaged Ben, is tainted. Putting Ben on his payroll as his trainer, because he feels that he owes Ben something after what he did to him, Charlie defends his title a number of times but now he's up against a much younger and more formidable opponent then those he fought, Marlow. Marlow has been going around claiming that Charlie been ducking him for two years because he's yellow. With Charlie set to defend his title he's told by Roberts not to try to knock Marlow out but to go the distance with him knowing that would mean that the decision would go against Charlie. Charlie at first agrees knowing that there a big pay-off for him in the fight. With betting his share of the money that he'll get for the fight, $60,000.00, against himself and with the odds 2 to 1 on Marlow Charlie can triple his money and retire from boxing a rich man. Telling his mom and girlfriend Peggy, Lilli Palmer, and all his friends to bet against him shocked them. Throwing the fight is wrong and dishonest he's told which in return, not realizing what he's planning to do, shocks Charlie. Charlie tells them that they aren't smart to know what the real things in life are and that's why he's successful and their not and he's the one who's been supporting them, his family & friends, all these years because he doesn't think like they do. With a huff Charlie leaves for his training camp in the country to get ready for the fight with Marlow. At the camp Roberts tell Charlie to fire his trainer Ben feeling that Ben is having a bad influence on Charlie. Ben's making him have second thoughts about throwing the fight. Ben angry and agitated at Roberts, whom he never liked in the first place, goes into a fit. Swinging his arms wildly like he was back in the boxing ring Ben loses his balance and falls on his head killing himself; and with that Charlie wakes up from his sleep. In the ring the fight goes into the late rounds with Charlie carrying Marlow for the first fourteen rounds with only one round left for him to throw and lose the fight to Marlow. Charlie, just three minutes away from losing the fight to Marlow, has a sudden change of heart. After what happened to Ben and and how bad he acted to his mom girlfriend and all of his friends who were counting on him to do his best in the fight, win lose or draw, he realizes just what a heel he's been. Charlie also realizes what a jerk he's turned in now getting his brains beat out in order to enrich a bunch of gangsters who'll use him for as long as he's is still useful to them and when he isn't they'll drop him just like they did Ben. Charlie with a sudden and explosive flurry of fists and leather opens up on Marlow and clobbers him to the mat where he's counted out, Charlie retains his title. Leaving the boxing arena with the crowd cheering, and his girlfriend back by his side, Roberts and some of his goons confront Charlie and tell him that he'll be sorry for what he did. Charlie Davis ends the movie with it's most famous line in it  What are you going to do to me? kill me? everyone dies.

After a series of victories he rises steadily through the ranks and is eventually rewarded with a shot at the championship. He wins, but success, and the wealth that comes with it, lead to deterioration in his character. He becomes estranged from his mother and his girlfriend Peg, finds himself a mistress, and becomes involved with a shady promoter named Roberts, who has links with the underworld. Roberts arranges for Charley to defend his title against a challenger named Jack Marlowe, but then orders him to throw the fight; the promising but less experienced Marlowe is the underdog so Roberts and his cronies stand to make a lot of money by betting on him. Body and Soul has a lot in common with Champion, another boxing film from the late forties, which tells a broadly similar story. That film too dealt with the rise of a boxing champion who goes off the rails, becomes alienated from his loved ones and allows himself to be drawn into the web of gambling-inspired corruption which afflicted the sport at this period. In both films the hero sees his final fight as a chance to regain his lost self-respect. Champion was made two years later, so it was no doubt heavily indebted to the earlier movie. Of the two films I would prefer Champion; John Garfield certainly gives a good performance here as Charley, but Kirk Douglas gives a truly great one, one of the best of his career, in the later film. The ending of Champion also has a tragic power greater than the more optimistic conclusion of Body and Soul. Some of the minor characters here are less good; I felt that the German-born British actress Lilli Palmer was miscast as Peg, who is supposed to be an all-American girl-next-door type, and the rather contrived explanation of her accent by reference to a European education was not convincing. (Devotion, a biopic of the Bronte sisters from around this period, used a similar device to explain why Charlotte's British husband Arthur Nicholls was speaking with a heavy German accent). Nevertheless, there are some interesting things about this movie. There is a genuinely tragic character in Ben Chaplin, Charley's predecessor as champion and later his friend, who is forced by Roberts to fight when medically unfit to do so, and suffers the consequences. Chaplin is played by the black actor Canada Lee, and this was a surprisingly major role for a black character at a time when Hollywood operated an unofficial colour bar and black actors were generally confined to minor roles. The dramatic fight sequences, especially during Charley's final bout with Marlowe, are well done; they are said to have influenced the fight scenes in Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull. Like a number of other boxing pictures, including Champion and Raging Bull, Body and Soul is about more than the sport itself. It is also a parable about the power of money and success to corrupt and a human story about a man's struggle to retain his integrity in the face of temptation. As such it works very well- taut, fast-paced and well put together. 7/10 "},{"Title":"Great boxing movie!","Date":"23 December 2000","Score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Film-Noir, Sport","Review":"  This movie is a great example of a movie that was done so well that it holds up even after over 50 years.

It's easy to see the influence this film had on Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull and I'd say the Scorsese picture follows this one quite closely. There are also a few more sequences, which were borrowed in Rocky. The most impressive thing about this movie are the boxing scenes, which are the most realistic and violent of any early boxing film I've seen. I'd say they've only been topped by the Scorsese film. Garfield is terrific as usual and really sells his character's many different feelings. Garfield perfectly captures the out of control scenes but he's also very good in the more tender moments involving a used up black boxer. The supporting cast is also very good with Lilli Palmer, Hazel Brooks, William Conrad and Joseph Pevney turning in fine work.

These abilities are on superb display in this boxing melodrama, one of the liveliest on that sinister sport. The best parts are those dealing with the struggle for Davis's (Garfield) soul, with Lloyd Goff's super-slick fight fixer as Satan. It's the classic contest pitting money against virtue, and while Davis is quick to grasp the rules of the ring, he's slow to understand the price he is paying. Not exactly cutting-edge material, but slickly and memorably done. The weakest parts are a seemingly miscast Lilli Palmer, a shade too refined to be believable, and Ann Revere's hair that looks like a flour-spraying crop duster gave it a quick pass. The film contains one truly memorable scene, when the washed-up black fighter, Canada Lee, at last confronts his tormentors. It's an emotion packed opportunity that really reaches gut-level. I guess the reason so many from cast and crew were later blacklisted is because of the film's communist inspired message &#x96; namely, that money is not the most important value in life.

The ways in which a fighter gets exploited by gangsters and gambling interests are depicted very convincingly and the negative effects that sudden success can have on a young boxer are also portrayed in a style which is both powerful and authentic.The events that take place during the fighter's rise from obscurity to world championship level involve a great deal of intrigue, intensity and drama and no doubt, this is exactly what inspired so many other filmmakers to produce similar types of movies which frequently featured many of the same situations that are seen in Body And Soul.Charley Davis (John Garfield) is a fighter from New York's lower East Side who's determined to escape the impoverished circumstances that he and his mother find themselves in after his father is accidentally killed when the speakeasy next to his candy store is bombed. Ignoring his mother's wishes, Charley decides to pursue a career in boxing.Charley's best friend Shorty Polaski (Joseph Pevney)had become his manager after convincing local trainer Quinn (William Conrad) to take Charley on and soon after, Quinn arranges a series of fights in which Charley is so successful that he attracts the attention of a gangster called Roberts (Lloyd Gough) who's the most powerful figure in the boxing business in New York. Roberts promises Charley a title fight but the cost is high as Roberts demands a 50% cut of Charley's earnings and the effective sidelining of Shorty.Roberts arranges a fixed fight for Charley against the ageing middleweight champion Ben Chaplin (Canada Lee) who has a blood clot on his brain. Charley is told nothing about his opponent's condition and after a punishing contest during which Ben takes a large number of blows to the head, his manager understandably feels double crossed by Roberts.Shorty is appalled when he discovers the circumstances surrounding the fight and after telling Charley what he knows, resigns. Tragically, he then gets beaten up by one of Roberts' henchmen and still groggy after his beating, staggers into the street where he gets run down and killed by a car.Peg (Lilli Palmer) had been Charley's loyal girlfriend since his earliest involvement in the fight game but after seeing what had happened to Shorty and becoming concerned about Roberts' activities, decided that she could no longer continue their relationship unless Charley decided to give up boxing. Predictably, Charley refused and then broke off their engagement.As Charley's success in the ring continues, he gambles heavily, becomes increasingly indebted to Roberts and starts seeing an acquisitive nightclub singer called Alice (Hazel Brooks). After an extended period as the champ, Charley is scheduled to fight a young contender in a fixed match which he's instructed to lose and to use his payment of $60,000 to bet against himself. How he deals with this situation proves to have significant consequences, not only for him, but also for Ben (who becomes his trainer) and Peg who starts to see a future for them together if Charley does finally give up boxing.The boxing sequences in Body And Soul were expertly filmed with hand held cameras being used to augment the work of the main camera crew and Francis D Lyon and Robert Parrish's contributions were recognised when they won the Oscar for Best Film Editing. John Garfield's performance won him an Oscar nomination for Best Actor and Abraham Polonsky also received an Oscar nomination for his marvellous screenplay.John Garfield gives a top class performance as the naive fighter who's seduced by the promise of wealth into a corrupt business where, in order to hit the big time, he has to make a Faustian deal which costs him his lifelong friendship with Shorty and damages his relationships with Peg and his mother. Lilli Palmer is excellent as the warm hearted Peg who's more intelligent than Charley and also has higher ethical standards. The supporting performances are also very good with Canada Lee making a particularly strong impression.

The script might seem to step into some fairly obvious footprints these days, but this pioneering drama, one has to remember, created those prints in the first place. Charlie Davis (Garfield), a poor Jewish kid living in New York, fights to the very top, with the help of his manager Quinn (Conrad, introduced in a brilliant scene in a pool room) and the slimy Roberts (Lloyd Gough), but in doing so, he sells his body and soul and abandons his mother, childhood friend and girlfriend.The direction is by Rossen, who would go on to make the classics All the King's Men (1949) and The Hustler (1961), makes an excellent film here, coaxing a brilliant performance from Garfield and splendid high contrast photography by James Wong Howe. The editing too, by Francis Lyon and Robert Parrish (who would also become a film director) is razor sharp and won the Oscar that year. A classic that stands up today as well as it ever did.

It's certainly one of John Garfield's best roles, finally getting into the ring the play Golden Boy had been written for him only for the producers to cast him in a supporting role instead, so there's an element of unfinished business here, though Abraham Polonsky's script is much better that Odets' rather patronising fairytale. Where Odets dealt in stereotypes, Polonsky and everyone else on the film treat the supporting characters with dignity and respect at a time when Stepinfetchit was the image of big screen black America, Canada Lee's performance as the former champ is a revelation &#150; he may not have much screen time, but he's one of the most clued-in characters in the piece, with a dignity and intelligence all but unheard of for a black character in the 40s.Despite the odd line like If you wanna fight, fight for something, not for money, it's not an overtly political film, though that didn't stop it being used as evidence of communist subversion in the McCarthy era few films can have had so many of its cast and crew blacklisted. Indeed, the HUAC must have used the credits as a wishlist &#150; Polonsky, Garfield, Ann Revere, Lloyd Gough, Canada Lee, Art Smith, Shimen Ruskin, producer Bob Roberts and even, albeit to a lesser extent, cinematographer James Wong Howe (who had originally wanted to be a prizefighter and famously shot the bouts on rollerskates to get a more fluid sense of motion) all found themselves either blacklisted or greylisted, while director Robert Rossen only avoided that fate by naming names. Some weren't even communists (although most were members of minority groups). It's actually horrifying to consider just how many people involved in the film, from top to bottom, had their careers ruined or even, in the case of Garfield and Lee, were driven to an early death. In retrospect, the famed great almost-last line What ya gonna do, kill me? Everybody dies. takes on a particularly bitter resonance.Aside from several future blacklist victims, it also boasts three future directors among its credits (Robert Aldrich, Robert Parrish and Nathan Juran) as well as montages from a fourth, Gunther Von Fritsch, whose directorial career never recovered from being fired from Curse of the Cat People.

When his father is killed in a mob attack on a local speakeasy, Charlie forgets his dreams and abides by his mother's wishes but soon cash gets low and Charlie ties up with a local promoter to go professional. Signed by bigtime organiser, Roberts, Charlie is soon on the way to the title but is he willing to sacrifice friends, family, ethics and more to play the professional game.Perhaps it is my preference for gritty drama over more straightforward dramas that has led me to think a bit less of this film than some other reviewers on this site. By this I am not inferring that I think this is a bad film, for I do not, but just that it didn't have a great deal to it that would have made it stand out. As a drama, it works well enough by having a solid plot, some emotional hooks and an interesting development. However for me it didn't engage me in an intense manner and it was too close to being a typical little guy made good melodrama rather than the gritty boxing world Robert Ryan's The Set-Up; B&S was just too clean and polished for my tastes &#150; yes the corrupt aspect of the story was there but it didn't seep through the film in the way that the presence of corruption and crime was meant to run through Charlie's story. That said it does still work as an effective boxing drama but there are other ones in the genre that get the grit and such right and are better than this.The direction is good though and the fluid cinematography really helps the boxing sequences. Although Polonsky's script didn't get the grit rubbed into the smooth, it does produce several strong dialogue sequences that stick in the mind and are quite quotable. Garfield plays his part well but is perhaps a bit too ambitious and American to help the film with the realistic grit it needed; however as a lead in a drama he does well and was pretty convincing in the boxing action as well. Gough is appropriately gruff and cold as the exploitative manager with good support from Conrad's equally corrupt but small time agent. Palmer and Brooks have good roles considering the nature of the material and they do well with what they have. Pevney is enjoyable in support and provides a bit of live behind Garfield's rather more stable character.Although it didn't have everything I would have liked in terms of tone and material but it is still an enjoyable drama. A bit more edge and touch of the noir about it could only have improved it but the performances are good and the whole film feels professional and enjoyable nonetheless.

The way both Scorsese and Rossen use blood, sweat, the white lights above, and a shaky camera (very documentary-like) when shooting the fights is very similar. The slow motion is not present in Body and Soul, but other than that the two approaches are quite similar.The idea of anti-hero is also somewhat present in both the two characters aren't nearly the greatest guys in the world-- they are greedy, selfish, clueless, and violent . John Garfield's character manages to redeem himself at the end, whereas the Jake LaMotta character never really changes in the end except to bathe in self-pity. There are several buddy squabbles in Body and Soul (both ending in tragic deaths) as well as lusting after more than one girl (much like Raging Bull). John Garfield's Charley  you can only pity until he gets wise to his actions after his trainer dies and he ceases to be the dumb fool; however, Jake LaMotta is always the fool unaware of what the consequences to his actions are. Neither character sees how anything that he does affects those around him--Jake is in it for the glory and the money and Charley is only in it for the money--but we watch, relate to, and root for the protagonists of these films. A huge part of that, I daresay, is how great the acting is in both. DeNiro is incredible and John Garfield is an actor way ahead of his time. Garfield is great in everything he did, although he wasn't given much variety in the roles they let him play. Here he plays the boxer from youth until middle age and the portrayal is believable every step of the way. There is a sweet intensity to Garfield and his acting is much more subtle than many actors of his time. He plays the part beautifully. All in all, what a great film.

He was only able to make a few outstanding films noir in Hollywood before he was blacklisted and chased out of the country, hindered from making any more films for next to 20 years, turning him very bitter against America and Hollywood - what a waste! The actors are all at their best and more than outstanding, especially Lilli Palmer at her most beautiful with the loveliest eyes ever seen on the screen, John Garfield as the simple but more than straight-forward boxer, Anne Revere as the mother who sees everything through, Hazel Brooks as the irresistible temptation, a downright bombshell of beauty, the unforgettable Canada Lee as the fellow honest boxer who gets all the beatings, and all the others, most of them crooks, and most of them blacklisted like Polonsky - all except Robert Rossen, who was one of the few that, like Elia Kazan, got away by cooperating with the infamous inquisition. But the strongest weight of the movie lies with the architectural composition - it all towers up towards the final boxing match, which the audience throughout the movie learns to have ever greater expectations of, with ever more troublesome complications in the way for John Garfield and his friends and family, one of them even getting killed, the definite turning point of the drama for the worse. When the finale of the boxing match finally comes you are not disappointed - it's a thriller in itself.

It's the quintessential boxing film, guaranteed to more than just please any fan of the genre.Body And Soul stars dynamite-actor John Garfield who literally busts his guts in his role as Charley Davis, the fighter who'll do almost anything to get to the top - And so he does with tragic results.It really amazes me that John Garfield (one of the best actors of the 1940s) didn't win a much-deserved Oscar for his superb portrayal of Charley Davis. Although he did receive a nomination that year in the Best Actor category.Body And Soul is an allegorical work that covers everything from the importance of personal honor to corruption in politics. With the seductive lure of money (and how it can derail even a strong, common man in his pursuit of success) Charley Davis must learn the hard way that self-respect is a much more important prize to possess rather than that of winning in the ring.Released in 1947 - Body And Soul is, without a doubt, an absolutely gripping Drama, overflowing, from start to finish, with stark, heart-felt realism. The performances in this film (especially that of John Garfield and Lilli Palmer) are nothing short of riveting and the sensational fight scenes are a real sight to behold.When it comes to a film like Body And Soul - They sure don't make them like this one anymore.

Leonard reminded her in telegrams after each victory that he was bringing home the bacon--earning far more with his fists than he ever could as a fiddler. Reviewer kayaker is badly in error.It was black lightweight champion JOE GANS who telegraphed his step-mother from Goldfield Nevada after his 42 round victory on a foul over challenger Battling Nelson in the year 1906 that I brought home the bacon--and lots of gravy too. Benny Leonard was 10 years old at that time.

Mr. Garfield drives quickly to his old New York neighborhood, where he is treated like the plague by stone-faced mother Anne Revere (as Anna) and sweetheart Lilli Palmer (as Peg Born). Lounge singer Hazel Brooks (as Alice) is a little nicer. We learn Garfield is about to fight in the proverbial fixed championship bout. A flashback reveals how a poor boy gives up night school for the boxing ring...In some quarters, Body and Soul has a reputation for being revelatory in subject matter; on close inspection, this is a dubious assertion. The storyline follows familiar territory. It is distinctive in excellent direction from Robert Rossen and photographer James Wong Howe. Garfield leads the cast in performing exceptionally; he received an Academy Award nomination, and was the New York Film Critics #2 choice for Best Actor of the year. The Parrish-Lyon editing won. Also watch for fine Supporting Actor performances by Joseph Pevney (as Shorty Polaski), Canada Lee (as Ben Chaplin) and William Conrad (as Quinn).******** Body and Soul (8/22/47) Robert Rossen ~ John Garfield, Lilli Palmer, Joseph Pevney, Anne Revere "}{"Title":"A Great John Garfield Film !","Date":"10 July 2004","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Film-Noir, Sport","Review":"               Every one of John Garfield's (Charlie Davis),He Ran all the Way,'51, films was outstanding and in this picture he did a fantastic job as a boxer struggling to make a living in very poor surroundings in New York City along with his mother, Anne Revere(Anna Davis),Birch Interval,'77,who tired to go on welfare but her son Charlie would not hear of it and decided to reach to the top of the boxing field.

For years and years I thought that RAGING BULL was the greatest boxing movie.The grit, grime, dirt, blood and guts which I thought was the trademark of Scorsese owes every ounce of its famous success to this film and to the riveting performance of one of the most fabulous actors in Hollywood historyJOHN GARFIELD.Not only did this movie explain just what it felt to live in the underbelly of the boxing world in those days, it was blessed with one of the most alarmingly charismatic actors everJOHN GARFIELD.The direction in the two important fights, first with the fabulous African-American actor and former pugilist, CANADA LEE and then the final fight, were so well wrought, filmed and edited that it utterly destroys any movie made before or after which dealt with boxing.  Now I know from what source Scorsese was inspired to direct the utter realism in his Oscar-winning movie.  I don't want to take anything away from Scorsese.  He's a master at his craft.  But this movie had something else more precious and now legendary.  It had a hard-nosed, smoldering, somber, street-wise, troubled, vulnerable and yes, lovable actor. It hadJOHN GARFIELD.

Their comings and goings seemed to take too long by an hour at least.This movie involves some very sinister characters and ends way too sanguinely. Would real slimeballs who had just lost thousands let a double-crossing boxer just walk away on his lady's arm? Very disappointing and frustrating. Not worth the time.

What is all the more remarkable are the blatant 'clues'. Garfield, a fellow alumnus with Odets of the Group Theatre actually had a minor role in the original production of Golden Boy - a plot, lest we forget, involving a gifted violinist who takes up prizefighting - more than this Garfield's previous movie role was Humoresque in which he played - yeah, you got it - a gifted violinist corrupted by money. Unlike Joe Bonaparte, Garfield's Charlie Davis is not in conflict with his artistic gifts (he has none) but is hooked on money and all it can buy or, if you want to get fancy, he is fighting his better nature as well as his opponents in the ring. Just because it owes so much to Odets doesn't make it a bad movie but Odets is there in every frame because Polonsky has opted to write about a world familiar to Odets and employs sub-Odets dialogue. In a strong supporting cast, Lloyd Gough, William Conrad, Lilli Palmer, Joseph Pevney and the great Ann Revere only lightweight Hazel Scott is superfluous. By now, of course, Garfield could play characters like this in his sleep but nevertheless this is a fine example of late forties film-making.

This time it's John Garfield who's the poor kid who puts on the gloves. The story is melodramatic, and as with most movies about the fight game, it's presented as a metaphor of American life and the American Dream. Well! Some of us might feel differently. The acting, by Garfield especially, is first rate, and the mood convincingly downbeat, at times depressing. As a bridge between the social consciousness films of Warner Brothers (who did not produce this one) and live television, the picture is fascinating, and one can see the liberal humanism of TV writers like Rod Serling aborning. The Philco and Alcoa shows were right around the corner.

I can't tell you where the sad scene occurred, but I will tell you about the plot.  It was about a boxing champion who fought his way to the top, and tried to fight his way out of scandals.  It's a overall good movie. "}]
