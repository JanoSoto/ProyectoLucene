Carrey must try to remember who he is. The people they know who he is are looking for him and will cause a lot of trouble if he doesn't find out quick. Fantastic, sweet and dramatic story.

Finally on a rainy Saturday, I put it on and was enchanted and moved. Jim Carey was great as were all the cast. The story seemed so very timely in light of recent national events. A land where dissenting voices are labeled unpatriotic and people of intellect and wide-ranging analysis are dismissed as elitist is positively frightening. The Majestic shows how we can get back to being our best selves and fulfill our promise as a nation that now seems so bleak to some of us. Caring about each other, our community, that is how we really come alive and make a difference. Building and striving for what is possible and making it safe to express and fulfill dreams gives me hope that we really can get back to where we belong if we'd only stop being so self-righteous, rude, and intolerant. I grew up in the party of Eisenhower but never felt that opposing ideas were unpatriotic. We need to be kinder to each other, recapture the courtesy of a lost era, be thoughtful and intellectually curious to be sure that we come up with the very best ideas and solutions we can in today's world. The Majestic is a wonderful reminder of what ordinary people can do when we come together and work to achieve something that uplifts a whole community. I heartily recommend it.

If you happen to like Capra-esquire movies, you will adore The Majestic. If you think they are silly, sentimental and simplistic, you won't. It's just that simple.The movie plot runs on two levels. Jim Carrey, playing straight, is Peter Appleton, a B-movie screenwriter in 1951 Hollywood who is trying to break into A-pictures when he is accused of being a Communist by the House Un-American Activities Committee. As the witch hunt begins to unfold, he has a traffic accident that ends with him and his car falling into a river. He is carried out to sea only to be washed up on the beach below Lawson, California - with no memory of who he is, his past life, or how he got there.He is promptly mistaken for Luke Trimble, a local hero missing and presumed dead by the entire town, who like 62 other Lawson boys gave his life for his country in World War II. Lawson's sacrifice was recognized by President Roosevelt declaring the town a national monument and sending a bronze sculpture to commemorate its dead. However, the town's losses have caused Lawson to lose its heart and its way.The reappearance of 'Luke,' and Peter's actions taken in another man's shoes, revitalize the town beginning with Luke's father, Harry (Martin Landau, in a great role) and The Majestic, the theatre owned by the Trimbles, which Harry had closed in 1942 presumably on learning of Luke's death. While Adele, the doctor's daughter (and Luke's fianc√©e) tries to restore 'Luke's' memory, Peter and Harry refurbish and reopen The Majestic, and bring life back to the town. All is going well in 'Luke's' life... until the investigators for the HUAC show up with a subpoena a couple of days after Harry's death - on the day of Harry's funeral, in fact - and coincidentally after Peter's regaining his memory.Peter's agent also shows up. He has news. It has occurred to the HUAC that in Peter's case, perhaps they are mistaken; but they have to save face. All Peter, a man who has never had much in the way of personal convictions, has to do is stand up at an HUAC hearing in Los Angeles and read a prepared statement in which he abjures his membership in the Communist Party, apologizes for his error, promises to mend his ways and name names, and all will be forgiven. He'll get his life back. His A-list film, which the studio shelved, will go back into production. He'll get everything he ever wanted.But Peter has a problem. It's Luke, you see. He was not just a local hero. He was a Hero with a capital H, and Peter has been him for a few months, as Adele points out to him; and when Luke reaches out from the past to touch Peter, Peter is ready to listen.If you are a Capra fan, you can guess the ending and will approve. If you aren't, you'll say this is a mixture of schmaltz and hokum with just a dash of idealism and SO not realistic. And if you say that, I say you're wrong.Capra could have made this picture, with Jimmy Stewart as Peter/Luke, June Allyson as Adele, Edward Arnold as the head of the HUAC, and a whole bunch of MGM's old reliable character actors in the supporting roles. The movie is a throwback to a more innocent time when people still believed in heroes and dared to dream about more than just maintaining the status quo. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it an 8; and I wish Carrey would make more movies like this. He's a better straight actor than he is given credit for. This is one of the movies you can tell will stand the test of time, and as such you should add it to your collection and your list to the 200 Greatest American Movies.

Sometimes I appreciated it, such as in Batman Forever or Bruce Almighty; other times I didn't, like when he preformed a butchered Grinch or when Ace Ventura made me sick with his humor. Still, whether I liked the movie's story, I admired the way his acting brought the crazies to life. The only exception I'd ever seen was him as the quiet, grown narrator in Simon Birch - until I found The Majestic. Here he doesn't have an outburst of anger, or a goofy-acting moment. He plays a Hollywood screenwriter, Peter - or Pete - Appleton, who thinks life is good and lives it normally. He's on the verge of making 1st-rate films, has an actress girlfriend, and is respected by all. But all that changes when he's blacklisted for attending a communist meeting, unawares, with his college girlfriend. He's now stripped of his girlfriend, who dumps him, and his career when his latest screenplay is examined by the FBI to see whether he is indeed a communist. Having too much to drink at the local bar, he makes the mistake of going out to drive afterward and crash-lands in a river, managing to escape the car but knocking his head so when discovered on the beach of Lawson the next morning by resident Stan Keller (James Whitmore, The Shawshank Redemption) he doesn't have a clue who he is or why he's there. The townspeople find him familiar, and shortly after he arrives former theater owner Harry Trimble (Martin Landau) is convinced that this is his son Luke, MIA almost a decade ago in WWII. The people, still grieving over the lost of 60 others, are delighted to welcome Luke home. He is content to live surrounded by people who admire him, Luke's girlfriend Adele, and work in the Majestic movie theater, unaware that he has both another life and a government agency waiting to catch up to him. This movie itself really is majestic. Someone I know who's always thought Carey overdid his roles saw this, and loved it and called him a good actor. I loved it myself. I thought it was odd how we barely met Pete's original girlfriend, who wasn't even shown breaking up with him, and the fact that the government suddenly had doubts that he was the communist spy they'd thought the day his trial was set, especially after they rejected his movie script as communist work and wrote his vehicle as belonging to a commie in the papers when it was found (and with the wallet picture found with it, why did nobody see its resemblance to Luke?). but I enjoyed everything about this anyway. This is by far the best Jim Carey movie I've seen.

This film highlights th actor Jim Carrey in a more serious role aside from his brilliance ion the realm of comedy. This film has a great message about standing up for what we believe in against any kind of oppression or tyranny even if it comes from our own government. This is told using a flavorful twist of identities, which of course is based primarily upon the old French Medieval legend- Return of Martin Guerre, and the growing concern of communism in the late 40's and early 50's. There are also some other historical aspects that need to be addressed. This movie came at the eve of 9-11, which led to a massive hysteria over, not Commies, but of Muslims. Interesting how the writer/director Darabont takes this lost character who takes another's identity and transforms him a hero by simply adding that Carrey had amnesia. He now has a great message to give to the courts and to the whole of mankind. At the time this movie came out, it seemed like the movie had little purpose and meaning. Watching it today, it has gained a new meaning and warning on our civilization(wasn't Darabont lucky). Unfortunately, I don't buy the argument and disagree. There are too many little details either missing or unlikely that hurt the story. Still, the originality, color, relationships, character development, angles, and plot development all draw to make this film highly enjoyable. This film receives 88.5 out of 100 points.

He's taken to a picturesque coastal California town and is mistaken (or is he?) for one of their boys lost in WWII.  And what a boy he was--handsome, caring, talented... and engaged to the local Drs. daughter.  Carey's character is confused and taken in by the love given by this town for their supposed returning war hero.  But is he that man?  Will he marry the girl he left behind?  Will the commie chasers from J. Edgar Hooverland find him and make him face the music?  Who is he, really!  This is a throw back to the Kapra-Korn of earlier years.  This is a movie that unabashedly creates a small town America that never was so polished and gleaming.  But despite the cornball-ity of the whole thing, the sincerity of Mr. Carey's acting along with a fine ensemble cast pulls it off.  It successfully explores the questions of just who are we, as inviduals and as a society?  Can we measure up to the ideals that we hold for ourselves and for our nation?  When is expediency--discretion, the better part of valor?  Is there a nobility in self-sacrifice and in the angels of our naive and better natures?  I like movies (and books and things) that ask questions and explore territory that is often neglected in this fast-cut, MTV film't age.  Sure it's corny. More than a bit unrealistic, but the sincerity of script and cast pulls it off. What is the greatest generation?  Any one where enough of us face the music... and dance.

It inhabitants are all kind, good natured, hard working, community driven people. There is not a single person in this town who is capable of a bad thought. Luke's fianc√©e Adele is the sweet, pretty (blonde), smart and devoted girlfriend. Luke's father is a gentle old man filled with love for his son and his old movie theater. The mayor is a friendly, community oriented leader. Heck, even the concession stand lady is sweet and lovable. This is such an idyllic portrayal of a town that it comes across and completely unbelievable. This kind of town cannot possible exist on this Earth.The key poignant moments such as the opening of the theater, Luke's father's death, Adele's talk with Luke at the cemetery and the speech at the HUAC hearing are so over-dramatic it makes you want to wretch. The dialogue is taken straight out of the Big Book of American Clich√©s is is absolutely cringe-worthy. The movie's themes of freedom of speech, heroism and hope are so simplistic that I felt insulted. A 5 year old could process more complex thoughts.In addition, the freedom of speech theme comes completely out of nowhere and completely shifts the focus of the movie with 30 minutes to go. It seems like a last-minute add on, thrown in as an easy way to wrap the movie up. When confronting the HUAC in court, Jim Carey simply invokes the First Amendment, tells the committee to go stuff itself and then WALKS OUT of court to a standing ovation. What? Are you serious?! The scene was so ridiculous that I was practically on the floor laughing.This movie is a complete waste of time for anyone who likes a movie that provokes thought, any thought, even just a little one.

Knowing no better, Peter accepts that he probably is Luke, and slips into Luke's life, starting with the town adopting him as a returning hero.Frank Darabont has produced a movie which stands shoulder to shoulder with The Green Mile and The Shawshank Redemption it is leisurely, gentle in many ways, always engaging, concerns the triumph of the spirit, and has some tremendously affecting, emotional moments.It is worth saying that the blacklisting issue is revisited - the audience always knows that Pete has been wrongly identified, and the discovery of his personal truth drives the last act - but the issues addressed are universal even though set during the McCarthy hearings.There is a large cast, all of whom are excellent. Jim Carrey's Pete is an absolutely straight part - it is unfortunate that one customarily needs to make that clear with regard to Carrey's films - but, to me, this film belongs to Martin Landau, with a performance which brought me to tears several times.I recommend this excellent film.

Unlike some early reviewers, I wasn't surprised that Jim Carrey could do a dramatic role, as I'd seen a very early film of his, Doin' Time on Maple Drive, as well as The Truman Show and Man in the Moon. This film is directed by Frank Darabont, who has directed two wonderful films I've seen - The Green Mile and Shawshank Redemption. Here he channels Frank Capra for a feel-good film that takes place in the 1950s. A blacklisted writer, Peter Appleton, gets drunk, has an accident, and washes up on the beach of a town called Lawson. And he can't remember a thing about who he is. In Lawson, he is mistaken for a World War II soldier believed dead, Luke Trimble, to whom he bears a resemblance. Luke's grief-stricken father Harry (Martin Landau), having not seen his son for some years, accepts Peter as Luke, and Peter believes that's his identity.The town is excited that Luke is back, and Harry decides to bring back his movie theater, the Majestic, to its former glory with Luke's help. Luke becomes involved with the town and its people; and Luke's old girlfriend Adele (Laurie Holden) is back on the scene. Little does Peter know, but the FBI is looking for him. One of his old films jogs his memory, and Peter realizes that he's not Luke after all. And he's wanted in Los Angeles to testify about whether or not he's a Communist.This is a beautifully done film, released three months after 9/1/2001 and very relevant when seen today. It's about standing up for what you believe in, the power of love, and what's really important in life. Jim Carrey is marvelous as an ambitious young man who finds his heart in Lawson; Martin Landau gives a magnificent performance as Harry, a man who finds a new lease on life.The Majestic stands as a symbol of a time when we walked into glamorous theaters to attend movies; when we sat wide-eyed in the dark; when films were more of a family affair; when life was more high touch than high tech; and when a person's principles and integrity were more important than anything else.

A young, ambitious Hollywood screenwriter loses his job and his identity, only to find new courage, love and the power of conviction in the heart of a small town's life. Peter Appleton is a script writer during the 1950's who is suspected to be a Communist among many Hollywood film people (which is not true). Along the way, he gets into a freak car accident and suffers amnesia, then ends up in a small California town. There he lives in a rundown movie theater where he learns the magic of experiencing a movie in it. Soon, the Communist hunters find him and call him to testify before a Senate hearing committee. This is kind of sweet simplistic movie like Hollywood used to make in the great days of CinemaScope color films. It's that kind of big film. Great Colors Great Fantastic Cinematography and for me the main hook of the film was its relation to the old movie theater (the Majestic) where most of the movie takes place. So you get a mystery about a somewhat lost Hollywood writer. You get an old theater removed to its classic state. You get the films glorious colors and a great plot and story. The story is sentimental but who cares-it gave me total escape into a fictional world which I seldom get. This helps us recall the golden age of Hollywood and film. This could be Carrey's finest role. We see a more toned down Carrey giving all many smiles in this very appealing fictional story. Carrey makes an excellent romantic and dramatic lead. Carrey deserved an Oscar for his performance in the Majestic. The film is long at 146 minutes but it is a beautifully executed film. One of the most underrated films of the last 20 years.

The supporting cast in this film is amazing; it is very pleasant to watch a film in which you find not just one or two characters that you learn to love but easily a dozen! I cannot suggest this film too strongly; I enjoyed it from beginning to end.

Nevertheless, my brother suggested I catch it, and I'm glad that I did. Had I still been an active film critic when it appeared (I've published over 200 reviews mostly from 1968-80, including many in the Boston Phoenix), I would have given it a very favorable review. Yes, it does get a bit sentimental and maybe too syrupy for some viewers. Maybe I'm just a sucker for a positive statement -- but I was thoroughly engrossed and moved.This is the film I think Frank Capra would have made out of the story of The Return of Martin Guerre (and remade as Sommersby). It has the small town sense of community so brilliantly created by Capra in It's a Wonderful Life, and the passion for justice and American idealism of Capra's Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. A review posted on this site sees the film as a vehicle for an attack on the McCarthy hearings and the infamous Hollywood blacklist. While the film certainly contains that element, I see the film as much more about the transformation of a character, and the political subplot is more a vehicle to accomplish that. It's a film that has yet to find its audience, but I hope it will succeed in doing so, just as It's A Wonderful Life was not fully appreciated as the masterpiece that it was until many years after its release.In addition to the strong and intriguing story of a man who suffers amnesia after an accident and finds himself thrust into another persona, the film also has marvelous cinematic qualities in the photography, music, and settings. Carrey's testimony at the committee hearing is breathtaking not only for its content, but for the way it is depicted on film.And the love story is also one that will make you weep.This is a very rich film, with multiple layers and meanings, and a true-blue wholesome core that has rarely been seen since Capra's days. I wholeheartedly recommend it.

The movie overall might be a little long, but not one scene, in my opinion, is wasted, it all builds up and simply could be considered as a work of art which would deserve a lot more recognition.Should become one of the 250 greatest films ever made.

It hits all the right notes too, even if the mildly subversive elements of this cautionary tale tend to masquerade as delicious slices of wholesome American nostalgia.First, I should warn you this is NOT a Jim Carrey movie. If you want to see Rubberface goofing around making artless observations about bathroom habits then go watch Ace Ventura or The Mask, or something equally subhumorous...this is not the movie for you.Here, Carrey actually acts, and by the way, he's really good at it. It's 1951 and Jim Carrey finds himself through a series of accidents in a small southern California town with his memory wiped clean. But to the townspeople, his face seems strangely familiar. This town really isn't like every other small town though...from this place, 62 young men sacrificed their lives during the course of WWII, and the friends and family they left behind have been coping with an enormous loss ever since. Because this film was released after 9/11 it resonates in ways much more profound than the filmmakers could have intended. You feel the impact in the heart more than the head.In the best role of his career, Martin Landau takes one look at Jim Carrey, and sees his only son Luke, missing in action and presumed dead for 9 and a half years. Landau lives above the Majestic, the long neglected movie theater closed down after the war. In an act of tremendous optimism, he decides to reopen the Majestic, and the whole town comes out of their rut and pitches in with the restoration. Besides a father, Luke also discovers he had a beautiful fianc√©e (the very talented Laurie Holden, from The X-Files) and soon enough they rekindle a gentle courtship. Things seem to be shaping up nicely for Luke if in fact that's who he really is.And that's where the plot takes a turn for better or worse.We live in a fearful age, and the same is true in The Majestic...then and now there are lingering concerns about our liberty and freedom resting in the hands of the powerful and possibly corrupt. In the early 1950's the threat was communism, and the powerful were seated on the House UnAmerican Activities Committee. Without revealing too much about the conclusion, I will say that when Jim Carrey's character is subpoenaed to testify before the committee, he has to choose between his honor and what had been his life. These scenes in their audacity make this movie, and in spite of all the heavy drama, there are a few very funny moments.The Majestic is the summa theologica of Frank Darabont, the man responsible for good films such as The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile. He says that in Hollywood, the story has died. I don't think that is true though, at least in this case. Because this film is not a mournful requiem, it isn't the story of just a man, or a romance, or even a family. It's about us, about ordinary people living in dangerous times--like the townspeople in the film. And through a familiar-faced stranger they found a hero, and a hope they thought had died many years before.The question is, can we do the same?

Getting away from his characteristic funny-man mystique, Carrey pulls off his dramatic very well, I think. Set in the 1950's days during the Marxist witch hunt in Hollywood, Carrey ends up in a small town where the locals think him to be a returned war hero, although he has no idea where he has come from because of a trauma wound to his head. Donned Luke by the locals, he goes through the motions, trying to remember his life and reclaim his position in the community. Luke struggles as he helps to rebuild the local theater named The Majestic which boosts the spirit of the town. Luke later begins to remember who he really is and struggles with how to break the truth to the small town, especially the girl that he has learned to love. The Majestic is a wonderful family movie for the whole family. Dealing with the loss and regain of life, love, and happiness, The Majestic is a movie about never losing hope and what a community can accomplish when they come together. What one man loses, he regains, while what one man regains, he later loses as well. There are some wonderful role reversals of several characters throughout the film. I really enjoyed how the town was so eager to turn against Luke as he was implicated by the incoming FBI agents, which is so characteristic of human nature. The politics of this historic event (blacklisted Marxists in Hollywood) in our past are clearly depicted. Especially as the newly self-identified Peter Appleton rises to the occasion and stands for what is right as he puts down his false-accusers. As the end of the movie comes full-circle, the viewer is left pondering on many of our current social issues. When bullies rise up, the rest of us have to beat them back down, whatever the cost says Luke, in a love letter to his girlfriend. The Majestic is a beautiful movie that I would recommend to anyone.

I recall watching the trailer in a theatre, and was eagerly anticipating it, but it never came. The major reason was that after being convinced that Jim Carrey could do drama (The Truman Show preceded this), I couldn't wait for The Majestic to open its doors. Good thing I managed to get hold of the DVD at library@Esplanade.And I wasn't disappointed! Carrey plays Peter Appleton, a Hollywood screenwriter in the 50s who works for HHS Studios. His story has been filmed and is screening at the theatres, the love of the life is an actress casted in the movie, he has one more work in the pipeline, so everything seemed to be going for him. Until he was accused of being a Communist by Congress, and his entire love and work life turns upside down.While on a drunken stupor, Peter meets with an accident, loses his memory and ends up in the small town of Lawson, California. While he can't remember who he was, the entire town seemed to know him, as Luke Trimble, a teen who had served and died for his country in WWII. And many of the young lads of Lawson did. Harry Trimble (Martin Landau) couldn't believe his eyes when he sees Peter, thinking of him as his son, and so did everyone else in Lawson.They throw a hero's welcome for Peter/Luke, and celebrate his bringing of new hope to the sleepy town. Skeptical at first was Luke's childhood sweetheart Adele Stanton (Laurie Holden), but it's not before long she casts her doubts aside and falls for Peter/Luke all over again.The charm of a small town is heavily contrasted with that of Hollwood's, with everyone knowing everyone else in the former, to the coldness and business like manner of the latter. Everyone in Lawson experiences positive energy given Peter/Luke's presence, and Harry decides to refurbish and reopen The Majestic, the town's cinema, where he and Luke lives in the apartment above. Perhaps it is this sequence of restoration running in parallel with the rekindling romance between Peter/Luke and Adele that is my favourite in this movie.But like a fairy tale, all good things must come to an end, and Peter/Luke eventually rediscovered who he was when he chanced upon his own movie being screened at The Majestic. Soon enough, his old life catches up to him, and he's left to choose to fight the fight and stand up for what he believes in, or throw in the towel and his integrity along with it.It's kinda interesting to have real events, like WWII and the anti-communist movement in Hollywood frame the background of what essentially is a love story, and a story of discovering oneself. And to that, Carrey did no wrong. While Truman Show had shades of some comedy (probably as a cushion to the transition), The Majestic is all serious drama and romance, and credit to Carrey for successfully pulling it off. While Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind had been my movie of the year 2004, I seriously think that The Majestic could have been a contender of mine for 2001. The number of cameo voices in this movie is astounding too, from Matt Damon to Garry Marshall, Sydney Pollack and Rob Reiner too.So do yourself a favour, especially if you're not a Carrey fan. Your impression of him might change after you've seen him in this movie. It's filled with many touching moments in this 2 1/2hr movie, and brings back the splendour of a time where movies were a grand escape from the mundaneness of life.

The thing is, as a kid growing up in the Fifties, it felt a lot more like I was living in America than it does today. Fourth of July parades were special occasions, and American flags waved enthusiastically on sunny streets in the middle of town. I don't think it's such a bad idea to keep that memory alive, even if it takes a Jim Carrey movie to do it.

I have long been a fan of Frank Capra, his movies are timeless, but often deemed old fashioned. Few even try to imitate him today. The director, Frank Durabont, for the most part succeeds. Some have complained that the film is too long. Others were unimpressed, perhaps because they had their standards too high (this film did come after the top notch films Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile). This film has a solid cast, Carrey gives a surprisingly earnest performance, and Martin Landau is heartbreaking. As an added bonus, we even get Bruce Campell in a small cameo.

This slipped through the usual glut of Hollywood movies, but it has so many facets, so much to say, combined with a delightful story and a wonderful cast to fill it out.Most people expect certain things from the headliner of this story, Jim Carrey, who's made a career of physical comedy with such favorites as Ace Ventura Pet Detective and The Mask, but The Truman Show showed his true acting potential, giving a range that hasn't truly been seen yet. As Peter Appleton, the amnesiac protagonist, he comes across as genuine and real as he moves through the movie, avoiding the comedic talents Mr. Carrey's known for and playing it straight. Many agree that this might not be his best work but it certainly is up there.But while the lead actor is great in the role, Mr. Carrey couldn't have sold this if not for a story which, despite the time it's set in, still echoes in the present. Many of the themes are timeless, drawing the audience in despite the decades that have passed and the generation gap. Without any spoilers, the story starts with known events of the age, embroiling the protagonist in the insidiousness, forcing him to escape, and in this, he begins a journey to find a new self he didn't even know he needed. By the end of the movie, Mr. Appleton is different, changed, by the people he's met along the way. There's subtle humor and romance intertwined through the story, while also touching upon the sense of loss the country felt after World War II to acknowledge, nay, honor the sacrifices made in that war.The rest of the cast comes across believably in their roles and make you care for those you're meant to, to loathe those you should loathe. Laurie Holden, as the confident Adele, shines on screen, particularly when paired with Mr. Carrey. As Peter's would-be father Harry, Martin Landau brings the character to life, letting the viewer feel the pain Harry goes through, the joy when he thinks the son he lost in war has returned home, and the quiet peace in Harry's final scene. Without the support of a great cast, The Majestic wouldn't have worked.In all, watch this once with an open mind and no preconceptions of the actors in it or the type of movie it is. This is one movie I can never pass up watching, even though I know it by heart and have seen it hundreds of times already over the years. This is not Oscar material, but it's a simple, well-crafted movie nonetheless, harking back to a different time when story, not effects or controversy, was what drew people to the movies.

It has a enjoyable soundtrack, lots of lively jazz (up tempo with sparkling piano solos) and Paper Doll by the Mills Brothers plays at one point. The plot is solid; mainly feel good, though it makes a number of good points along the way. Bruce Campbell has a small cameo that is pretty fun. He plays a B-Grade actor in the movie with in a movie Sand Pirates of the Sahara.Back to the movie and why I liked it, nay loved it.It speaks to the basic good in humanity. Jim Carrey plays a man who has no idea who he is and an entire town takes him in with open arms. They are pretty sure they know who he is, but nothing is definite. What he represents might mean more to these people than who he ultimately, truly is. A small town that has lost too many of their young men to the Second World War, the possibility that they have gotten one of their boys back gives them hope, heart, comfort, joy. He rejuvenates the whole town.This movie also speaks to the darker sides of the human spirit.It's a fearful time, especially to be anyone working in Hollywood. Jim Carrey plays a the part of a screenwriter who is wrongly accused of being a Communist, during the days of the Hollywood Blacklisting. His life as a movie man is most certainly over, he is innocent of the charges but may end up in jail- his only hope is to give an oath to tell the truth and then lie, calling others in his industry (many of whom he's never even heard of) communists. He is given a boiler plate I __ name __ so that they may have the opportunity that I have had to purge myself of my communist ways. It's a witch-hunt atmosphere where fear feeds on itself and things can only get worse.Jim Carrey is great in the movie. His character knows initially who he is, then he has amnesia, then he rediscovers who he is- only to find out that he is no longer the man he thought he was. Throughout the movie he has picked up some admirable qualities, strength, courage, conviction, wisdom, passion. Doing what Luke (the man he at one point thought he was) would do, he takes a stand against fear mongering, stands up to a very biased Congress, speaks truth, asks questions, and resolves not to let the bullies of the world take over. That's not the America people like his amnesiac doppelganger fought to defend.It's a passionate picture and you can't help but to feel impassioned as you watch it. And at the end you feel good, like you have just won in a battle of good over evil. A very good movie.

The story concerns itself with the plight of a screenwriter in the 1950s, who is blacklisted after it is found that he attended a Communist meeting during his college days.  His world falls in, he has a car accident on a stormy night and his consequent amnesia leads to an identity crisis.  Having been washed up near a village far from his hometown, his is mistaken for someone who disappeared from that village and tries to rediscover a life for himself before eventually his past catches up with him.  He finally overcomes adversity and manages to remake a name for himself in the unforgiving Hollywood of the fifties. While obstensibly about the impact of the Mc Carthy era on the life of a prominent screenwriter, this is also a movie about the love of the movies, epitomised in 'The Majestic' movie theatre.  Rarely has a film captured so neatly the joy and the magic of the movies.  Some viewers may be reminded of scenes in Last Action Hero as I was. The Majestic is a film full of delights, not least the splendid period detail, which reminded me of Back to the Future.  The smalltown values are very much to the fore.  Jim Carrey evolves here as an actor and perhaps surpasses all his previous work. I first heard about The Majestic before it was released in 2001 as a guynow a friend I met from Mendocino who worked on the film told me about it when he came to Wexford on holidays.  I resolved to see it and it certainly didn't disappoint. This is a movie made the way they don't make them anymore and I don't think we'll see its like again for a long while.

One is put powerfully in mind of the limitless love and admiration for the British way put into wartime films by Hungarian Emeric Pressburger, in his superb film-making outings with Michael Powell. There is a lot of the Canterbury Tale or A Matter of Life and Death ambiance in The Majestic, even if the primary homage is apparently being paid to the films of Italian-born Frank Capra, another immigrant in America from childhood. Admittedly, this is (for once) a film that Darabont did not write as well as direct, the task in this case being for Michael Sloane. And, just to get it straight, this is not the romantic comedy it is unfortuitously described as, and it is a hundred times better than the box office flop some have written it off as.The line between proud and touching homage and pastiche is narrow indeed, so a great deal of what keeps this film (just) out of the latter category comes down to the acting. In the starring role, Jim Carrey (mostly) not being Jim Carrey is refreshing in the extreme, but the real plaudits go to some superb portrayals by older actors.Watching this film for the third time in my life now (and having largely forgotten the plot details), I was again stung into tears with the emotion of the Carrey character's rescue by and first encounters with - in fairly quick succession - the picturesque small town, and specifically its senior citizen Stan Keller (played by the late James Whitmore), veteran cinema-owner Harry Trimble (the co-starring Martin Landau, who puts in a marvellous performance), Doc Stanton (David Ogden Stiers) and Sheriff Coleman (Brent Briscoe), and then Mayor Ernie Cole (Jeffrey DeMunn). This description of the immediate setting up of our image of the town sounds traditional and structured to the point of syrupy clich√©, but somehow avoids being so, and is instead a remarkably moving tribute to basic human kindness and decency. This is only added to as we meet up with black First World War veteran Emmett Smith (played by Gerry Black).This is a first contrast with the world Peter Appleton really inhabited prior to his accident and memory loss, in which the shallow and pointless razzmatazz and cynicism of Hollywood is just now coming into uncomfortable contact with the unpleasant, aggressive, intolerant hostility-cum-brutality of the Unamerican witch-hunts.But back out there in what the makers would like us to see as the true(r) USA - neither profit-oriented at the cost of reality, nor mean and politicised and paranoid at the cost of reality, there is Lawson, California, where our amnesiac hero finds himself washed up (literally). The town has a yawning gap in its age pyramid due to the War, which means that many key roles are played by people(mostly men whose sons, though with a few women whose boyfriends) have made the supreme sacrifice, or at least paid a very high price. They and their town are scarred, despite their patriotism and belief that the right thing has been done. Lawson is indeed a beautiful, comforting, secure, sedate place in which (nearly) everyone is kind, nearly all of the time, but part of the reason for that is underlying pain and loss, and there is a stagnation there that means that 1951 for these people - even when they do let their hair down - is much closer to Glen Miller than it is to Bill Haley.The arrival (or return) of Carrey's Luke Trimble doppleganger is the trigger for the town to move on, risky a step into the unknown as that may be. And here the film is far less formulaic than it might at first appear, thanks to its being suffused with tension. We the viewers know that, through absolutely no fault of his own, Appleton-Trimble has raised such high expectations among the townsfolk - so much hope and need has been pinned on him - that at any moment sad reality is likely to be returned to with a bump - and of course this is all the more the case given that he may well not even be the person he is taken to be. Luke's girlfriend (superbly played by the now-very-familiar Laurie Holden) is among those waiting to be convinced, but she falls back in love anyway, and this too is serene and touching, and all the more so when augmented by doting photographic touches, as well as the somewhat Aaron Copland-like score from Mark Isham.It would be a sad world indeed if we laughed or yawned at, or derided as ludicrously out-of-date and implausible, a world in which people help each other, fall in love, love their families, believe in things, believe in their country and are prepared to die - or suffer loss - in its name. And happily The Majestic does not encourage any of these negative responses, instead going into surprisingly sophisticated and multi-layered battle with meanness and cynicism and apathy, behind the shining suit of armour that is faith in decent small-town America. It is a pleasure and privilege and moving delight to see such well-crafted work so convinced of its own message, and the whole approach reaches a crescendo in an admirably chilling and authentic-looking Committee testimony scene. This film will surely not suit everybody, but some will be impressed and moved enough to have it change their lives at least a little.

This is not the great film that the previously mentioned film is but it does hit the right notes with its historical points. Carrey is wonderfully sympathetic within a life that he accepts because others do. Landau is excellent as his father who aims to reconnect with his son and unify themselves through the theatre with others. Laurie Holden plays the love interest in a familiar role that never seems to elevate. Other roles are standard including Bob Balaban portraying an annoying finger pointer with the charge against Carrey and Communist activity. It is a reflection on a time when cinematic magic was truly something majestic.

Peter Appleton (Jim Carrey) is a Hollywood B-movie script writer on the rise. He attended an antiwar meeting during college and he's blacklisted. His contract isn't renewed and his movie is pulled. He begs to testify in Congress willing to make up names for them. He wakes up with amnesia after a drunken crash. Stan Keller brings him to the quiet town of Lawson, California. Dr. Stanton (David Ogden Stiers) treats him seeing something familiar in him. Harry Trimble (Martin Landau) believes him to be his MIA son Luke. They live above the rundown theater The Majestic. Adele Stanton (Laurie Holden) was Luke's girlfriend. The town was devastated after losing sixty young men during the war. The first half is a slow ponderous story but I like the nice fable. I'm willing to accept it. It's got an old-fashion sentimental feel. However the movie just won't stop. It's long and slow already. The ending runs on. The hearing turns too preachy.

I love this movie and have watched it many times, often inviting friends to watch it. Invariably, they are also delighted and overwhelmed by Carrey's acting and that of the artfully performing supporting cast. I am disappointed that the reviews at the time of the movie came out were quite good but the box office earnings was poor. Perhaps the public did not believe that Jim Carrey could perform a movie role without being silly, comedic or vulgar. But he can, and he should have gotten much more recognition from Hollywood for his superb acting in this deserving cinematic effort without his usual tactics. I believe he did an Oscar performance. Jim, if you ever read this, please do more dramatic roles like this. Don't cheat the public from your talent and ability, which is to make us believe, make us enter into your world as we did in the world of Peter Appleton and Lawson, California.

Not only is the storyline itself similar to Hollywood fantasies of the late 1940's and 1950's, several scenes ring of old movies. Townspeople often gather in front of the main character and his girl. In some sense, the film is like a film within a film, in which the people of the small town are like the audience and the characters like those on stage. The Majestic is an inadvertent realization of the world is a stage, but unfortunately, as things play out, the central theme is applied like a bull-dozer. Only in a few scenes do we see the character exhibiting blood, sweat and tears, at the beginning and near the end. For much of the middle, he's almost too happy, things working out too well. There's an old adage of storytelling which says only trouble is interesting. Unfortunately, the trouble takes a back seat to the elation.The premise could have been concocted straight out of a Frank Capra screen concept. A b-movie screenwriter in 1950's Hollywood, Peter Appleton (Jim Carrey), is accused of secretly harboring communist sensibilities and therefore could be spying for the USSR. His career in film is essentially at an end, and he's being summoned to Washington to testify in front of the House Un-American Activities Committee. He then takes a trip with his only friend, a little stuffed monkey, up the California coast where he gets into a horrible accident on a bridge. He's washed up on the beach like a crew member of a ship lost at sea. An old man discovers him and helps him to the nearest town, an unassuming small town on the California coast called Lawson which rings similarly to Bedford Falls of It's a Wonderful Life. Appleton suffers from amnesia and doesn't who he is. He sees pictures in the town windows of local young men who fell overseas fighting in the Second World War.He happens into a local coffee shop where another elderly gentleman, Harry Trimble (Martin Landau), recognizes him. He's convinced it's his son, Luke Trimble, who went missing-in-action during the war. The local towns folk then reacquaint themselves with who they believe is their long lost soldier, one of the few who has returned. They decide to hold a large celebration in his honor. He even meets Adele Stanton (Laurie Holden) who had been Luke's fianc√©. She is absolutely drop-dead gorgeous and yet for nearly a decade she's not hooked up with any other men, which is one of the many problems with the storyline.Since the town believes he's a hero, he goes along, even though some aspects don't seem right. Although he can't remember, there is a sense that Appleton knows that things aren't they way they should be, which is the best aspect of Carrey's performance. Trimble takes him home and shortly thereafter proposes they re-open the local movie theater which has laid dormant since the war. Of course the name of the theater is The Majestic, and it gives Appleton, now Luke Trimble, a new sense of purpose and direction. At the same time, the FBI has decided that Appleton must be a communist spy since his disappearance from Los Angeles.The central problem with this film is that it lacks balance. The joy and elation of the townspeople enjoying the return of their long-lost hero goes on for about as long as an endless dance sequence from a musical. Almost no one in the town questions that Luke Trimble is a war casualty and has returned in the flesh. I was expecting to see more doubt among some of the townspeople. I also wanted to see the darker sides of both characters, Appleton and Trimble, but both seem too perfect. Maybe a curse word from Appleton which would never have been on the lips of Trimble, or visa-versa. Only one towns-person is not happy to see Luke Trimble but not because he doubts it's really him but because he was a rival before the start of the war. It was also difficult to buy the idea that Adele Stanton was not with another man, and that when she started spending time with him, she thought something was wrong. It would have made more sense if she was with someone else and then flabbergasted concerning Luke's return.The script really needed several more rewrites with added confrontations between Carrey and doubters. Only one character reveals late in the film that he knew Trimble wasn't Trimble. Aside from him, the joy of most of the town upon celebrating the return of Luke was just a bit too saccharine and forced. When they begin to renovate the movie theater, the entire town pitches in to help. I half-expected them to start singing Kumabya. It reminded me of those old Bing Crosby movies where the cast is trying to solve a problem and everyone decides the solution is Hey fellas! Let's put on a show! Again I expecting a bit more blood regarding his return similar to the story of Martin Guerre, a returned war hero who turns out to be an impostor. Only when the FBI catch up with him is there some meat to the story again, but this occurrence is about 80% through the film. The film was 75% in the bliss department and only 25% in the trouble department with too many additives and preservatives. If trouble is what makes a story interesting, The Majestic needed to reverse the numbers. By film's end, Appleton/Trimble had not gone through hell and back to make me feel like he's really been through something which significantly causes him to change. In It's a Wonderful Life, George Bailey goes through hell to get back to heaven. With Appleton/Trimble, it was more like a short-cut.

I'd like to think the reason is the whole quality, not quantity' angle, but as we saw with his stint on AMC's 'The Walking Dead', that's not always the case, meaning the studio execs have tried to intrude on almost every single one of his projects. That being said, Frank Darabont has given us some of the best films ever made, one in particular usually makes the #1 spot on many Best of All Time' lists.I'm of course talking about 'The Shawshank Redemption', which was based on a Stephen King short story. King and Darabont would go onto collaborate on a few other films in the future, including 'The Green Mile' and 'The Mist'. Time and time again, Darabont has shown us what true filmmaking is and can be. Darabont got his start writing 'A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 Dream Warriors' and the 1988 version of 'The Blob'. Darabont then forged a good relationship with Steven Spielberg as he went on to write a bunch of the episodes of 'The Young Indiana Jones Chonicles'. He also re-worked the screenplays for 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Minority Report' for Spielberg. Then, of course, 'Shawshank' and 'The Green Mile' hit big on all levels, winning awards and praise from virtually everyone.While the horror film 'The Mist' is not included in this set, which is a shame, Darabont's less popular film 'The Majestic' is. I firmly believe that 'The Majestic' is one of the most underrated films ever made. It's a beautiful piece of filmmaking with a genuine story, great characters, and an amazing performance from Jim Carrey, who doesn't do his usual comedy schtick, but delivers a very endearing and emotional performance of someone who is lost on multiple levels with his life. There are already perfect reviews of both 'The Shawshank Redemption' and 'The Green Mile' here, which you can click on their respective titles to view those reviews, but if you'd like to know my opinion on those, I believe they are both some of the best films ever made and continue to grow with each viewing.However, let's get back to 'The Majestic', which stars Jim Carrey, Martin Landau, Laurie Holden, and Bruce Campbell. Carrey plays a man named Lule Tremble, who is a writer for feature films in Hollywood in the 1950s, where every script is changed by old studio execs trying to make a quick buck. He heads out for a long drive after his script is changed to a virtually unrecognizable piece of fluff to clear his head, but ends up crashing his car along the coast. He wakes up with sever amnesia, where he can't remember a thing about who he is or his past life. It turns out that the town he crashed near had a guy who looked exactly the same as him and was feared dead in the war.Now everyone in town is trying to make this complete stranger remember his life in the town, when in fact he's never actually been. Soon enough, everyone in town try to put the pieces back together for Luke, including setting him up with his old flame and rebuilding an old movie theatre. The side story here, which I feel that bogged the film down a bit was that of the government trying to find Carrey's real character, who was a protester during a communist rally, which back in the 50s, was a serious crime. Jim Carrey delivers on of his first dramatic performances here as he struggles to try and fit in and make all the super sweet people of this small town happy, even though he is not the answer to their feared conclusions. It's not his fault, because he sincerely doesn't remember.This movie along with possible 'The Truman Show' were possibly the sole films where we realized that Carrey was more than just 'Ace Ventura', but rather an actor capable of much more. Darabont really nailed the time period of the 50s as well, giving us a very warm and almost fairy tale like ambiance with white picket fences and bold colorful period clothing. I think this film didn't do as well or hold the same value as the others is that most people didn't expect such a dramatic performance from Carrey nor such a dramatic film as a whole. I think people were expecting a straight out comedy, rather than an endearing film set in the 50s. Whatever the case might be, 'The Majestic' is a brilliant homage to the films of the 1950s with enough heart and soul for two films.

There are many of the baby boomers who can say they remember these story's and heard of the losses of their families. If you ever travel thru small towns in the mid west you will see the history of this. The markers, the graves, the remembrance of it all.

It is a gentle story, about the hearts and hopes of people. It is kindly told, the way a parent tells a bedtime story to a child. Slow, simple with great meaning. Perhaps this is why I really like it so much. It warms my heart, gives me hope and makes me realize that the really important things in our lives are each other. It reminds me of my Grandfather telling me a story. There is wonder, honesty, entertainment and a moral. This is on my 'Must See' list but going in you have to know what it is to appreciate it. "},{"Title":"Get Out Your Handkerchiefs.","Date":"28 March 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" There's a little bit of something for everybody in this sentimental and heart-warming, thoroughly commercial, tale of the rise, fall, rise, fall, and rise again of Jim Carrey.It 1950 or so. Carrey is a screenwriter in Hollywood, now accused of being a communist by the House Unamerican Activities Committee because years ago he attended meetings of the Bread Instead of Bullets Club at UCLA, with the intention of being near a girl he was interested in.Blacklisted by the studio, he gets drunk, drives a long distance, has an accident, and loses his memory. He is thence taken by a sympathetic old chap to the nearest town -- I forget whether the name was Meadowville, Smallville, Homewood, Arcadia, Camelot, Brigadoon, or Cloud Cuckoo Land, but it's one of those idyllic towns that only exist in The Twilight Zone -- in which impossibly amiable people all mistake Carrey for a World War Two hero whose body was never discovered.The unwitting Carrey is f√™ted, re-introduced to his old girl friend, has love lavished on him by his ailing father, Martin Landau, and brings the bereaved community back to life, symbolized by the reopening of the defunct MAJESTIC THEATER, towards whose refurbishing the entire community has contributed. It's opening night is a blaze of color and neon glory. The awed mayor -- my co-star, Jeffrey DeMunn -- buys the first tickets.However, the obsessed hunters of HUAC are in hot pursuit and manage to track Carrey down, at which point his memory returns and he realizes he's not Luke, the winner of the CMH, but just another blacklisted screenwriter. The confrontation, the presentation of the subpoena, takes place just after Landau's funeral, in the town square, surrounded by residents. Man, the predators went out of their way for this commie on the lam. There are half a dozen big black Buicks with those vertical grills that look like fangs in an angry mouth. The hunters have some of the most misshapen faces ever committed to celluloid. The worst part is that Carrey, now believed to be a communist agent, is shunned by the community that loved him so much. Even his girl turns away in disgust.I said there was a bit of something for everyone. We can start with the popular tale of Martin Guerre, done and redone cinematically several times. Then there is Frank Capra and his adoring but fickle crowds. Then there is the letter from the REAL hero, who evidently did die in combat, that is a shameless rip off of a very moving letter that was written by a soldier to his wife. It's read aloud in, I think, Episode Two of Ken Burns' magnificent documentary on the Civil War.The climactic scene has Carrey called to testify before the HUAC. He's expected to read a statement, after a no-more-than due humiliation by the legislative Inquisition, confessing that, yes, he was a communist, but he apologizes -- and furthermore, here are the names of some other Reds I've known. This long, drawn-out courtroom scene ends appropriately with a rip off from Woody Allen's The Front. But, despite Carrey's pre-testimony anguish, there's never a doubt about what he will do.The beautiful photography of the little coastal town is impressive. My God, do I want to live there. Everyone friendly. Nice beach. No garbage in the streets. No graffiti. No minorities at all except one perceptive and sympathetic black usher at THE MAJESTIC THEATER.But the film is repulsive because it thinks that you and I are so stupid that we don't see the skull beneath the skin. The movie (and the wistful music) tugs at our heart strings. It brings tears to the eyes. But it does so as mechanically as peeling an onion does. It plays the audience like a funereal organ moaning out Oh, Mein Papa. The story is so desperate that it will do almost anything to get an emotional response. It will drop an entire story of an amnesic young man bringing a renewed spirit to a dispirited little town, and it will thrust us into a political story in which good is innocent Jim Carrey and evil are the guys with the heads straight out of an Ivan Albright painting.The performances are fine but they can't overcome this shoddy material. The writer, Michael Sloane, and the director, Frank Durabant, ought to be ashamed of themselves. The Twilight Zone did both kinds of stories better.

Director Frank Darabont, working from a dewy screenplay by Michael Sloane, aims for no higher ambition than tugging at viewers' heartstrings; the two men pile on the presumed-need for warm nostalgia in attempt to make an emotional connection with a mass audience, when actually just some smart writing would suffice. There isn't a wet cinematic clich√© that Sloane doesn't try to resurrect, while Carrey (reeling it in for prestige) drifts through the picture staring at everyone's top shirt button.

Such was the case with Steve Martin, and so it was with Jim Carrey until The Majestic came along. In this film, Carrey plays the principle character of what is obviously a very contrived script. But by playing the part straight, avoiding all the gestures and distorted facial expressions that have become his trademark, Carrey manages to turn what could have been a campy/cheesy parody of a Frank Capra file into a feel-good movie that is timely in its message, and makes me wish the world I currently live in were more like his character's world. Carrey's co-stars do an equally excellent job at convincing the audience to believe in their characters, as well.

The town of Lawson sees him arrive after an accident leaves him with amnesia. They believe him to be one of 'their lost' sons from the war. Jim Carrey's 'father' played by Martin Landau is superb and the chemistry between them in the movie is very moving. The pain, grief and pride shown by many of the characters in the film at the loss of 65 of 'their' young men during the war is so tangible it makes feel you are there; right there feeling the sorrow and remorse of what has happened. However, the relationships between the characters, their unresolved need to be able to move on with their lives and with the belief of their returning 'hero' Luke'. Jim Carrey's character Pete, is brilliantly played and scripted. Jeffrey DeMunn is honourable as the father who has lost two sons in the war and your empathy with him, again, is felt in every part of the film. Lauri Holden plays the 'love' interest in the film as the girlfriend of the hero 'Luke'. This film is not sloppy, sentimental nor 'wet'. Its 'true grit' of what a town like Lawson must have felt after the war. It is also rather poignant there are town's in Britian today who will also feel the same. One to watch and one to remember.

I let that scare me away from watching it for a long time. Tonight, I finally got around to watching it on Netflix. It was available on instant stream, so I figured I'd go ahead and give it a shot.I feel a little ambivalent about the movie...I think it was better than a lot of people give it credit for, but still not as good as I might've hoped. I really liked the beginning, I felt almost as if I were watching a novel come to life. It had a very slow pace that I kind of enjoyed, but then it felt like the movie was in a big hurry to end itself toward the latter half of the film.How did I come to that conclusion? Well, the same night that Peter/Luke (Jim Carrey) figures out who he really is, is also the same night his father Harry (Martin Landau) has a fatal heart attack. Then, at Harry's funeral, Carrey's character confesses to his love interest, Adele (Laurie Holden), that he is not the man she thinks he is. Right after that happens, the government baddies show up to take him away. It's just a little too bing, bang, boom to me. The movie takes such a long time to build itself up, only to let itself end far too rapidly.I thought the performances were very good, and Carrey does surprisingly well, too...Although, I saw him slip into his shtick a few times, for the most part, he stays pretty true to his character.Overall, I wouldn't say The Majestic was a bad movie, but I wouldn't go so far as to say it was great, either. I think I'd feel comfortable in saying it was pretty good. I don't know if I'd necessarily feel comfortable in recommending the movie to everyone, but I think that as long as you don't mind seeing a predictable happy ending, you won't mind watching this movie. For me, I felt a little conflicted about the ending. I didn't want to see what would've been more likely to happen, which likely would've been too dark and depressing, but I also felt like I was feeding into the whole audiences love a happy ending thing, which is fine, except for when a happy ending isn't always what a movie calls for. I'm not saying The Majestic fits in this category, but perhaps an ending that wasn't too dark and depressing nor the best case scenario also known as the Happily Ever After ending could've been envisioned and perhaps utilized more effectively here. Although, in all fairness to the movie, I'd rather see the happy ending they chose than the bleak one they could've gone with, so I do think they made the right choice. I just wonder if maybe a third option could've been thought up? "},{"Title":"Four good stories and a miscast hero","Date":"30 July 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" The important thing is that I enjoyed this film. It has 4 entertaining stories of unequal qualities that involve the character played by Jim Carey.The first story is about a screen writer whose unimpressive work is a B-movie that has a swashbuckling hero sword-fighting with a stereotypical villain to rescue a damsel in distress. It's the 1950's and our writer loses his job in the anti-communist witch hunt. There is no real character development in this sub-plot. It is just there to set up a memorable film-within-the-film and to introduce the subject of the Hollywood blacklist.The second story tells of the screen writer losing his memory and then ostensibly rediscovering his identity as Luke, the long lost war hero of a small American town. This is the major part of the film and it is very well worked. The supporting characters are more than mere walk-ons. There are strong parts for Luke's father, the town mayor, the doctor and his daughter who was Luke's fianc√©, and a jealous rival. Jim Carey only needs to play surprised at their revelations which seem consistent and in their own way convincing. The utopia of Luke's hero status is reminiscent of the utopia of the film Pleasantville, and just like in that film it will be shattered.The third story is about restoring the town's derelict cinema, the Majestic of the title. It is an obvious nod to the classic Cinema Paradiso but without the magic of that film's pathos. Luke's memory loss was the foundation for the second story but it drains the third story of drama.The fourth and last story has great potential but it shows up the film's weakness which is its miscasting of Jim Carey. The first story provided the set-up for two arrivals the B-movie arrives at the cinema and triggers Luke's lost memory of who he is, and the witch hunters from Washington arrive on cue. In classic Hollywood style there is a confrontation in court between the power figures and the lone individual with right on his side. This too has shades of Pleasantville except that the confrontation with McCarthyism and the Hollywood blacklisting was a real, not a fantasy symbol issue. Jim Carey lacks the pondus that this role needs and his awaited decision to do the right thing, which we always know that he will, is hesitant and more confused than idealistic. Carey is memorable as a clown and does a fair job of distancing himself from that stereotype for this film. But neither his efforts nor the script he is given make him credible as a moral saviour. "},{"Title":"Worth watching","Date":"23 January 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" I must say for starters that I really liked this movie. I must say it was a very unconventional and the plot was very, very jarring.While trying to be as unspecific about the details of the plot as possible, it basically follows the story of a Pete Appleton, a Hollywood screenwriter, who after a car accident in which he falls into a river causes him to suffer amnesia, ends up washed up on a beach-side town and is recognised as somebody who has died in World War II.There is a very particular style that the director uses really well. This movie, which is set in the 50's with a lot of time spent talking about the movies that were being made at the time, imitates the style of film that was being made at the time. A convoluted plot that seems to lend itself to a romantic comedy, the tone is feel-good, light, non-violent, non-edgy and with a heavy romance element that was so innocent that it harked right back to the era where a kiss was seen as vulgar.However, the events that take place in the movie are seriously dramatic and tension-building and it seems like the movie is going to end in a very dark place despite all the, obviously deliberate, colouring of the light elements thrown in. Its an interesting contrast and left me feeling a bit uneasy all the way through.As you can tell, the tone of the movie was all over the place, but this didn't make the movie worse, in fact it was one of the best qualities. It certainly pulled my emotions around somewhat and kept me engrossed.Jim Carey and Laurie Holden were great and the supporting cast were excellent, especially Martin Landau as Harry Trimble. I also loved Gerry Black as the usher.My only gripe is that I was generally a bit unaccepting of the over-the-top crowd scenes and I didn't find the ending to be completely satisfying, even though it fit right into the underlying style of the film. But of course we all have to make up our own mind.

I really just thought this movie was so well written and all the characters were just amazing. The speech at the end is just so true and you can feel yourself standing behind him one hundred percent. The only thing i did wonder about is at then end of the movie it pans out showing pictures of Jim Carey and Harry and a wedding photo of Jim Carey and his wife but it doesn't show any photos of Pete Appleton's family before he went to this town.

Man is that hard work. Settled on 2 movies for the kids, and 2 for me and wifey. The first we got around to seeing was The Majestic.The Majestic is set in the US in the 1950's where the Government is extremely fearful of the threat of communism spreading on it's shores. The Feds are on a witch-hunt, looking for any possible people who may be spreading the communism message and even those showing interest in it. Upcoming Hollywood writer Peter Appleton (Carrey, in his finest work since Dumb and Dumber) is one such suspect, and when his career looks shot due to a pending enquiry, Peter one night drives out of town to deal with his frustrations. Due to a strange sequence of events, Peter falls into a river, bumps his head and gets amnesia. He is awoken by a local the next day, who takes him into town for some breakfast and time to work out what happened. Peter can't remember what happened in the accident, let alone the last 30+ years of his life, so stays and tries to work it out. Very quickly though an old man notices him and is sure Peter is his son Luke, who was believed to have died in WW2. He looks the same and seems to have several similar characteristics, so everyone goes along with it, even though Peter (who doesn't know who he is don't forget) isn't so sure. Before long Peter has embraced who everyone thinks he is and starts to relax into his surroundings. Is Peter really Luke? Is Luke really Peter? Does Peter really exist? Does Peter just look like Luke? Is Peter dreaming? See it to find out! I really enjoyed it because it kept me guessing, was set it a nice little town and it had a nice little story. Carrey does a nice job and is backed up by a solid cast, especially the dad, and more hey it's that guy guys than you could poke a stick at.

I was not a big fan of Jim Carey before this film but now I certainly am. He, along with everyone else in the film are excellent, but the story itself, while a tad bit far-fetched, is what did it for me. If you can get over that one small flaw, this is a movie that will lift your spirits and make you feel good about the country we live in. Although the movie is very long, it held my attention all the way through. If you aren't usually a fan of feel good movies, give this one a try anyway. This film is just one more reason why a bad movie review should be ignored until you have the chance to judge for yourself. "}{"Title":"An Unexpected Gem with only Two Flaws","Date":"22 April 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" I acquired a DVD of this movie about two years ago. I am usually not over fond of John Carrey. And I watched 15 minutes of The Majestic and then gave it up in disgust. Fortunately, I did not trash it or give it away.Then it seemed to be just another rather over-sentimental chocolate box design melodrama based on nostalgia for the early 1950s. I myself am quite nostalgic about my own non-American 1950s as a child but I don't generally like the stuff being spooned down my throat (figuratively speaking).However, yesterday I noticed The Majestic in my movie collection and decided to give the film a second chance. Wow! It turns put to be a real gem if you can get past the first ten minutes or so. This time Carrey shows his real talent, instead of the mindless jinks he gets up to in most of the other movies I've watched him in. He is assisted by a superb supporting cast of whom only one or two are well&#x96;known outside of TV series.Let me say initially what I still do not like about the movie. First, it need not have been so long. This was mostly as a result of too many pregnant pauses and over-stretched intimate scenes between the hero, the heroine and the old man who imagines that he is the hero's father. Second the near fatal flaw which has prevented the film achieving full marks of excellence is the awful soggy background musical sound track. It reminded me too much of that in the 1960s Peyton Place TV series. Indeed, it has overtone of a soap opera (which The Majestic is definitively not). The music track was as irritating intrusion and as awful as the canned audience laughter in an otherwise good TV sit-com. Nothing else was bad, in fact all other aspects of the movie were outstanding.The plot partly revolves around a dilapidated and unused cine theatre in a small town on the Californian coast. It calls to mind works such as the Ealing Studios 1957 comedy The Smallest Show on Earth where a young couple inherit and try to revive a decrepit old theatre and Italy's 1988 Cinema Paradiso. Also the film's small town setting calls to mind Frank Capra's 1946 It's a Wonderful Life. But the actual plots are entirely different. The Majestic is shot in Southern California in warm evocative colours and each frame looks like a Norman Rockwell magazine cover. In contrast to the background music track the borrowed music used (for e.g. a jive dance scene) is contemporary and pleasing.The plot involves a young script-writer producer - Peter Appleton (John Carrey)- who learns he is to be summoned to appear before the notorious Un-American Affairs Committee. Many folk in Hollywood were obliged to do so during the McCarthy witch hunt period where every other intellectual was regarded as a clandestine, unpatriotic, communist spy. Peter's studio bosses decide they have to can his latest work-in-progress and let him go until the matter is resolved (to get off the hook he may have to sign a statement that he renounces his alleged membership in the Communist Party and finger a list of other Hollywood personalities whom he has never met).To drown his sorrows he and his stuffed monkey mascot have one too many drinks in the Bongo Congo bar. He then decides to take a spin along the coast road in his convertible Mercedes. But in an effort to avoid a possum on a narrow one lane wooden bridge he, monkey mascot and car end up in swift flowing river. Pushed by the current Peter bangs his head on a stone pier of the bridge and is stunned . The next morning he is discovered on an ocean side sandy beach cast up by the tide. The old man who finds him as he regains consciousness then brings him into the small town nearby for breakfast in a diner and for some medical attention to his head wound. Now this is not the first movie I've seen where somebody loses their memory nor where they are the victims (or beneficiaries) of a mistaken identity.Will leave it at that, Peter is mistaken for a young town denizen, Luke Trimble. A GI who has been missing in action during the recent World War II, and is presumed dead since his body was never found. Luke even has a tomb in the town's memorial graveyard. Peter is incredibly like the missing Luke and is re-discovered by Luke's old father, who is the owner of a disused cine theatre,The Majestic, and is fully convinced that Peter is his son.This situation is fertile with the many predictable and quite a few unpredictable outcomes which are the stuff of good melodramas. The movie's makers have fully and successfully developed such opportunities. Over nearly three hours they have neatly handled and resolved the plot and its sub-plots in a manner which would make Shakespeare himself proud of them&#x96;but for the two flaws I have already mentioned.The film was produced by Castle Rock , which has also made a number of Stephen King based-movies including The Shawshrank Redemption and The Green Mile. So it is not surprising that at least two of the main actors have appeared in other Castle Rock movies. Altogether The Majestic is a highly entertaining melodrama for a wet week end or for an evening when the fare on regular TV sucks.

No he didn't scream Smokin! and he didn't talk out of his butt; why is this a problem?  The movie has a concrete story, a very well played supporting cast, and a great lead.

The more experiences one has lived through, the more they would get out of this movie.  I think to  understand loss, one must have known love; to understand courage, one must have known fear. To start with, I was beginning to think Hollywood couldn't make a movie without filling it with smokers and foul language.  I liked the fact this movie was relatively free of such things.  I know movies imitate life, and sometimes that okay, but movies also serve as a role model for our children to a certain extent. My favorite in the movie was Harry Trimble (Martin Landau) for a couple of reasons.  First, I think he hit the nail right on the head when he said `.there's magic all around you, the trick is to see it.'  I think that's a good philosophy to live by.  What's wrong with looking at life through rose-colored glasses just a little. The second reason I liked Harry was he makes us appreciate the love that should exist between a parent and child.  Having served with and around the military for over 40 years including two years in Vietnam, I saw both fathers and sons die in Vietnam.  To really appreciate such a loss, one must really appreciate the love and value of a loved one.  For instance, think about all the hours spent raising, loving, and caring for a child reading with them most every night, sickness, soccer practice, homework, playing catch, braces, etc. and I could go on but I think you get the message.  To lose someone so dear must have caused tremendous pain and grief.  With Harry, he gets a second chance at life.  I can't help thinking what I would give to have a second chance to talk with Grandma once more on her front porch. I was also impressed with Jim Carrey (Luke/Pete).  I used to think Jim was just another comedian trying to act.  But when I saw him in the movie `Lair, Lair', I realized he was capable of doing some serious acting.  My favorite part of him in this movie was when he gave the speech in front of the committee.  I thought it was real.  Having taught for several years at a military school, I recall when I first started teaching.  I was not born with a gift for gab.  I feel Jim (Pete) came across just as I might have, trying to find the courage and right words in front of all those people. The speech also reminds us that we all need to think about what we're fighting and dying for.  Remember all those nights reading with your child. Is the cause great enough for him or her to die for? The best I save for last.  I thought Adele (Laurie Holden) was the glue that held this story together.  She is so beautiful and your heart goes out to her when she first walks into the diner and realizes Luke doesn't recognize her.  Imagine the sense of loss and heartbreak.  My favorite part of the movie with Adele has to be the one of her in the red dress at the dance. Can you imagine having to leave that to go fight a war?  Now that would take more than courage, I think! In summary, The Majestic goes down as one of my all-time favorites.  Sure, you could find holes in it if you tried hard enough.  But for me, the movie was full of magic, all you had to do was look for it.  I might add that the soundtrack is full of feel-good music.  My 8 year old grandson is inspired to play the piano after listening to it.  His favorite is the `Boogie Woogie Stomp' by Jim Cox and he loves to sing along to Nat King Cole's Orange Colored Sky.

Usually, there can be a clear-cut answer, but in the case of movies like A.I &#150; Artificial Intelligence, I did not know for sure. In some cases, I am seeing a decent movie, hoping it could be more. In other instances, I actually wish the movie was less.All of this leads me to The Majestic, a 2001 Jim Carrey movie. In the end, here is what I feel I had seenGood acting. Good cinematography. Good characters. Good situations. The common word there, obviously, is Good. Notice that I did not say Great. That is where I hoped it could be more.Here is a film in which Jim Carrey plays his part basically straight. He is a fairly normal person in the real world. Well, as real as it was in 1951. Carrey is not acting over the top like The Grinch, or an unusual and outrageous person like Andy Kaufman (Man on the Moon). In The Majestic he is also not playing someone in an unusual situation, like The Truman Show. For that reason, I thoroughly enjoyed Jim Carrey. Nowhere in The Majestic was he trying to simply go for laughs. In fact, now that I think about it, I don't recall ever once simply bursting into laughter.Certainly the star of the show, Carrey did not ever try to steal the spotlight away from anyone. He lets them all shine, and many of them do. Other than Jim Carrey, the other actor who deserved plenty of recognition is Martin Landau. He is very absorbed into his role. And, at a pivotal time in the picture, Jim Carrey makes the perfect decision regarding Martin Landau. I applauded him for that.The downside of The Majestic was that it was a little too long. It had to be able to tie up the loose ends of all that was happening, and there is almost too much going on. Carrey's amnesia, and his relationships with everyone in the town, was adequate enough to fill up a movie. But, having the additional aspect of him facing the accusation of being a Communist during the McCarthy era, provided another complicated portion that required too much extra time.Using my four-star rating system, The Majestic easy gets, ***. I will someday enjoy watching it again.The DVD did have its flaws. No commentary, no bloopers, and no documentary.

He would NOT (in his prime, or perhaps ever) have made something as turgid, and for the most part as dead, as this.From the moment Peter Appleton bangs his head to the moment when the two separate plot strands (finally, FINALLY) curl around and meet one another, there's not a single scene with any life - okay, to be fair, there's maybe one or two, but it comes to the same thing. Unconnected scene after unconnected scene, we're thinking to ourselves Why are we being shown this? I mean, why THIS? And why is it taking so long, and why is it so curiously dull?(Some spoilers follow.)And yet there's also too much material. I have no quarrels with the overall shape of the story; I can see the connection (not meant to be obvious at first) between Luke fighting in Europe and Peter standing up to HUAC, and I must admit I enjoyed basking in the two consecutive moments of triumph towards the end, even if they sit ill with one another (the ending, so far as the plotting went, needed a LOT of work, just as the rest of the movie so far as the pacing went needed a lot of work). But was the father and son stuff really necessary? Neither director nor writer really seemed to think so, since the moment the father looks as though he might get in the way of the plotting, he's packed off with unseemly haste - that is to say, he has a sudden heart attack, which DOES get him out of the way, but results in yet more material that's purely utilitarian in purpose, and NOT utilitarian in the sense of providing pleasure. Then there's that story conference at the end, where we hear a voice-over ask while the camera focuses on Jim Carey's face But has our hero suffered enough? and we groan heartily as we realise that we're now going to have to endure some supposedly clever self-reference, on top of everything else.I'm being harsh on The Majestic because it COULD have really been good. Frank Darabont, despite the impression I may have conveyed, is actually a good director; he just needs to divest himself of his habit of staring in the same rapt way at EVERY SINGLE MOMENT, as though they were all equally important or interesting. This worked well with The Shawshank Redemption, which had a crackerjack story, moulded into perfect shape by Stephen King long before work on the film began. It hasn't worked nearly so well since.Some film-related nit-picks the aspect ratio of Sand Pirates of the Sahara is exactly the same as that of the rest of the movie 1.851. This is ridiculous. A black and white B-movie of 1951 would NOT have had so wide a screen. (By way of comparison, even the lush, expensive A-movie with which The Majestic opens - An American in Paris - did not have so wide a screen. Its ratio was 1.371.) In almost all other ways as well, Sand Pirates of the Sahara is a pretty poor pastiche. And what was wrong with the suggestion made at the story conference at the end, involving the dog? Why shouldn't the hero of Ashes to Ashes go blind? Why shouldn't a blind man have a guide dog? Why, in short, does Peter Appleton describe this idea as about the dumbest thing he's ever heard?

He is found on the beach near a small and nearly forgotten Southern California hamlet. Upon waking, he has no memory of who he is. The kind old man who finds him, thinks he has seen him somewhere, but isn't sure. He takes Carrey into the town where it becomes clear he is a ringer for a young man who died in WWII. Not knowing who he is, seeing what he thinks is himself in photos kept preserved by his Father, played by Martin Landau. He takes on the task of giving the town it's life back.

But, alas, after meeting the love of his life and bringing the town back to what it had once been, all good things must end. Carrey regains his memory. I'll not give away any more of the plot for those of you who have yet to see this film, but I think it is worth watching over and over again.

The Green Mile and Shawshank Redemption have many minor classic moments.  This movie adds a couple of more.  I also appreciate his efforts to feed the old regime in Hollywood by casting James Whitmore, Hal Holbrook and Martin Landau.  David Ogden Stiers turns in a nice quiet performance as Adele's dad.  Speaking of Adele, this is the downfall of the movie.  Laurie Holden does not have the strength to give this role the presence it needed.

The Good Frank Darabont, one of my favorite directors.  The Bad Jim Carrey, a comedian I'd tired of.  I'm glad to say, the good was only slightly under par, and the bad was, refreshingly, not bad at all.The conflicts, the contrasts of this film are its true strength.  It's a clash of two American dreams.  In one, friends become names on a blacklist. Films are meant to fill pocketbooks.  Self-preservation is the bottom line. In the other, strangers are given the shirt off one's back.  Films fill the heart.  Sacrifice transcends all.  The incorporation of the red scare is what's most ironic and uplifting.  While Hollywood and Washington tear each other down in fear of Communism, we find a small town, ultimately far more American, and at the same time, very communal.  It seems to support itself not through profit but through helping hands & shoulders to lean on.  And yet it does this out of unity, mercy, patriotism--all of America's greatest ideals.Sure, like the small town Carrey's character washes up in, the film is a bit old-fashioned and cheesy, but these are simply its traits, not its flaws. In fact, the cynical criticism the film has received is not unlike the true antagonist of the film an America out of touch with itself.Darabont is no disappointment here.  Good visuals, a great cast doing a great job, and as is his trademark, a beautiful, uplifting look into years past.  I'm only sorry he didn't write the film as well.  Were he to, this film might've rivaled Shawshank as his greatest.As I said, I hadn't been fond of Carrey since the first couple of his mindless comedies (i.e. Ace Ventura).  Everyone seemed to want more, but it had gotten old.  He did, however, hint at something greater in Truman Show, and he delivers in The Majestic.  Subtlety will probably never be his strong point, but he's learned to tone down and channel his expression well.  Our expectations of him actually work to his benefit, as we can enjoy him even at points when we'd otherwise dislike the character--I caught myself chuckling a few times when it probably didn't merit laughter.Overall, this film is not quite as great as its idea, but it's still wonderful.  More than likely, this film will earn a spot among my personal favorites.

It is a wonderful feel-good light drama about the good and bad of what Hollywood gives to America, and the games the power people play freely with the lives of others (on this note, the two studio conferences actually voiced by accomplished directors, are utterly hysterical gems). The Majestic is also a marvelous depiction of the great American small town, and a realization of just how much we have give up in the name of progress -- the cast, led by vets Whitmore, Landau, Stiers, and DeMunn are just wonderful in this regard.  As a romance, it gets an incomplete.  Laurie Holden is never particularly convincing in her character despite great support from Papa Stiers, so the director wisely lets the true romance be between Carrey and the town, with Holden reduced to suitable window dressing.  The nice try is the attempted lesson to be learned when America turns into a bully.  I must assume that the film was already filmed when the War Against Terrorism broke out, but the lesson of not allowing our fears to turn America into a police state has never been more appropriate.  But Balaban plays the Roy Cohn surrogate so broadly and ineptly that the menace never seems to have enough teeth.  Also, from a pacing standpoint, I think we spent too much time watching Carrey feel out the town before he mistakenly accepted his new identity enough to put his heart and soul into rebuilding the Majestic -- a nostalgic valentine well-deserving to be the American equivalent of Cinema Paradiso. This movie is not for the hard-edged, hyper-critical, and misanthropic -- they are welcome to watch Requiem For A Dream or Traffic again if they wish.

Actually Hollywood is at its best when it leaves for a while aliens, space ships, and monsters and looks at itself. This is why the scenes around 'The Majestic' theater in mid section of the film where the ones I enjoyed most.  I liked less the retorics in the last third of the movie. It is incredible in my eyes that even the best discourse about the American Constitution would have saved the day in the period of the anti-communist paranoia. It is also hard too believe that the small American town at its own could have distinguished so easily between right and wrong, at that time. But, that is a Hollywood movie, and the so predictable happy-end was, I guess, inevitable. A few words about the actors. There is a good deal of good acting in this film. Jim Carrey's part is certainly the one we are to watch, in one of its first non-comical roles.

As he begins to adjust his life as Trimble in this small town, he ends up discovering the real truth about who he is, and what he is about to become.The Review It's no doubt that Jim Carrey is a truly great actor who can expand beyond his range of usual dick and fart characters. From the urinating in a beer bottle Lloyd Christmas in Dumb and Dumber, to the ridiculously stupid antics of the Grinch. He proved a breakthrough performance with The Truman Show, which was a summer blockbuster, and turned in a spot on performance in the underrated Man On The Moon, a film overlooked by all including the likes of the academy. In The Majestic, Carrey's third shot for Oscar favor, he turns in a fairly good performance in a film that just doesn't hit the right notes with it's audience. The problem with The Majestic, is it isn't in love with itself, it's not the thin mask of Frank Capra's spirit residing over it, and it's not the picture perfect look of the place, but it's two movies wrapped into one. It's a character driven, small town drama on one hand, and a political, freedom of speech drama on the other, and it can't quite make up it's mind. Because of this, audiences are left pondering what kind of film they saw, not to mention the considerable length of the film (2.5 hours). The cast is very good, but the film doesn't seem to hit the right notes. The production design, cinematography, editing, and direction are well done, but unfortunately, the film doesn't take off like it needs to.Grade C+ "},{"Title":"Jim Carrey gives a great performance of an even greater script.","Date":"13 January 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  I watched a screening of this movie earlier tonight.What I liked most about it was how entriguing it was.

The supporting cast, filled with I know I've seen him or her somewhere before!-type character actors, is equally adept. Technically, the movie is very solid, if not unspectacular.Of course the critics and many on the IMDb have lambasted this movie, generally for the schmaltz factor. But seeing as how it's a send-off to the Capracorn classics of the 1930s and 1940s, schmaltz isn't really a factor at all, unless it were to be completely overbearing, which it is not.Going in, it is helpful to think Capra. Because the movie really does combine that famed director's best elements The lone everyman fighting a corrupt or unjust system, patriotism in the forms of dying for the country and studying its founding documents, and a final, climactic, triumphant speech.And The Majestic pays off in spades. Jim Carrey's performance as the everyman is no Jimmy Stewart, but it is still an A+, Oscar-worthy performance. He fights the corrupt and unjust McCarthy unAmerican activities committee. But on his way from being accused to standing before the committee, he has an amnesia-inducing accident. He washes up on the shores of a small town that mistakes him for one of its sons who was lost in World War II.Not sure of who he is, Carrey's character accepts the adulation and helps rebuild the town's historic movie theatre, the Majestic. With it, he rebuilds the town's spirits, which had been shattered after losing dozens of children in the War.But when his memory comes back - coinciding with his fathers death - revealing he is really a blacklisted Hollywood screenwriter accused of being a communist. The town - including the fallen soldier's fiancee and now Carrey's girlfriend - turns on him , and he is arrested by the FBI.Now he has to decide whether to capitulate and renounce being a communist or stand before the committee and fight for what he knows is right.The movie is full of patriotic gestures, including a moment of silence for the men lost in WWII, and Carrey's epic speech before the committee is reminiscent of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. The respect and adoration given to the Constitution is tantamount to any of Capra's movies, and Carrey's homecoming to the same small town is It's a Wonderful Life in a slightly different setting.Yes, it's sappy. Yes it's schmaltzy. But so was Capra. And his films are regarded to today as cinematic classics. Indeed, Mr. Smith is still watched in high school government classes to this day, and what adult hasn't watched It's a Wonderful Life at least once?The Majestic is nothing more than a Frank Capra film with different cast and different director, filmed in color. Carrey adds a few touches, and Darabont's style is more flashy than Capra's, but nonetheless, it is an optimistic and satisfying film about triumphing over adversity. It's a film that should go down as one of the first films to help America recover from the Sept. 11 attacks.But thanks to narrow-minded critics and cynicists who believe optimism should be relegated to black and white, The Majestic will go down as one of the most underrated movies of the decade.10/10 "},{"Title":"A Touching Story","Date":"8 January 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" Jim Carrey once again proves that he can do both comedy and drama in this film. Set in 1951 Carrey plays Peter Appleton a Hollywood writer who is blacklisted by a former girlfriend who says he is a communist which during the McCarthy hearings was a kiss of death. Losing everything from his job to his girlfriend, he decides to drive off as far as he can go on a tank of gas. But during the ride He accidentally falls off a bridge and into the river and wakes up on a beach near Lawson, CA. Suffering from amnesia, he walks into Lawson where and old man (Martin Landau) mistakes for his son Luke, who is M.I.A. during World War II. Not remembering anything Peter believes him. The movie then goes on to show how the town is rejuvenated when everybody thinks he's Luke and He helps reopens His father's old Movie house The Majestic. But it goes downhill when he regains his memory and FBI agents track him down and tell him he has to testify before a congressional hearing. The movie can be very emotional at times, (especially the final scene with Carrey and Landau.) It also gives a history lesson of how unfair the McCarthy hearings were.

I'll admit that the Majestic is lighthearted fare, yet there seems to be a general disdain for movies like this nowadays; films which do not push the limit in some way and perform simply to entertain. The Majestic works on a level as an ode to the great American love affair with film, in some impossibly distant and bygone era. Some corner in the soft-focused recesses of our minds. It reminds us of why we love to go to the movies, and in a sad way, why the golden age of film cannot return. As I sat in my local multiplex, I took note of the prices at the concession stand; the cramped size of the theater (1 of 15 inside); and heavens, the $9.00 ticket which emptied my wallet. I couldn't help but lust for the days of grand movie houses which have long since shut down. A place and a time when people dressed up even to see a movie, and for a quarter you could treat yourself to a double feature. While Britney Spears danced around selling Pepsi on screen before the film, I couldn't help but feel as if something had gone terribly wrong in America since those good old days.   The Majestic is a wonderful film with great direction, great acting, (especially Carrey and Landau) and the kind of story which draws you in to some warm place in history where people were still civil to one another. Perhaps I'm being idealistic, and there never was such a place. Yet as I drove home through Hackettstown, passing the late - Strand theater and its marquis which glows no more, I couldn't help but feel as if we've lost something in our modern mega-theaters. Something about neighborhoods and shared experiences, and a slower pace to life. The Majestic may not challenge us or push film to some new extreme, but it does draw you in and entertain in a way that most films this year could not. It forces you to slow down and savor what film can be in the right hands. Now if only we could get rid of Britney spears...

Carrey works in the lead; you can actually forget fairly easily that he is a former stand-up comic, and possesses the most elastic mug and manic sense of physical comedy since Jerry Lewis. This is one of those films you wish ended a bit more simply than it does; the wrap up takes a fairly complicated route to making everything alright in the end.

Those people may not like Majestic either.  However it's not really derivative of Capra.  Majestic is an original movie with an original premise.  There are no angels or saints except those we see walking among us on a daily basis.  There is no time travel beyond that of the trip we are asked to take to the 1950's.What is surprising, is that this is really a film about a man finding out what love, honor, pride and all of those other great American values mean. It starts with a man who never had an honest conviction in his life.  He discovers that there is evil in the world by virtue of being stripped of everything he values (money, position, women).  He is (not giving anything away beyond the trailers) miraculously transported into the life of someone who looks just like him but is, in every other respect, his complete opposite.  He sees, for the first time in his life, what it means to see the glass as half-full.Does this intrigue you?  If so, you will probably enjoy Majestic.  The acting, directing, costumes, sets and writing are all top-drawer.  If you are one of those people who just doesn't like Jim Carrey (well- you probably wouldn't be reading this review if you were) he may surprise you here. While there is plenty of humor in this film, it is all old-school humor, Norman Rockwell humor, ordinary people laughing at themselves humor.  No mugging, pratfalls or outrageous (talking from the butt) behavior inhabits this movie. If that is what you want from Jim Carrey, stand by for acting.In fact, the only real criticism I have is that Majestic is, sometimes, too earnest.  But that is a faux criticism coming from me, because I found the over-the-top sincerity of this movie a refreshing breeze amid a sea of clever, manipulative plots.I know this review rambles more than most.  But this is a movie that rambles.  It strolls through the life the leading man never had and, ultimately, longs for.  If you can check your cynicism at the door for a couple of hours, it may leave you longing for that life as well.  I rate Majestic 9 out of 10.

Some films pull this off flawlessly; others don't. Guess which category The Majestic falls into.This movie had more sap than a Vermont forest in fall. While I was willing to let some things slide, the ultra-predictiblity of the film and the hounding life is art message was too much. Jim Carrey plays Pete Appleton, a screenwriter who gets blacklisted from Hollywood during the McCarthy witchhunts. He drives off in a car, crashes into a river (a scene in which too much time is spent), and loses his memory. The citizens of a small town find him and believe him to be a long-lost hero of theirs, who dissapeared nine years earlier in WWII. Martin Landau plays the owner of a dilapidated old movie theatre who thinks Pete, now Luke, is his son. Together they rennovate the theatre, Luke picks up his relationship with his old girlfriend Adele (Holden) where it left off, and life is rosy.Even though it's your basic memory-loss story inserted into a thin shell of anti-communisim, it isn't so bad thus far; until we see the McCarthy bad guys determined to find Appleton and slay him as the king of all communists. Here the plot crosses that line from comedic screenwriting 101 to just dang ridiculous. Every cinematic plot point ever made in history is paraded across the screen, leaving the second half of this film more limpid than the first.What's ironic is that this film starts with Appleton sitting in a room twitching his face while the producers mangle his script to make it more hollywoodesque. I guess we are supposed to laugh at the fact that these producers (recognize the voices? Garry Marshall, Carl Reiner, Rob Reiner, and Sydney Pollack) are inserting every stupid plot trick into Appleton's script; however, because the movie itself did just that, I was groaning, not laughing.

After a year of meaningless and thoughtless films we have been blessed with The Majestic and A Beautiful Mind.  David Tattersall, Darabont's cinematographer, composed a beautiful picture with Jim Carey giving us a real and nevertheless honest performance.  Any so-called boring pieces are just not apparent.  The simplistic nature of the story depicts a way of life that indeed existed during this particular era. The stubborness of politicians and resistance of heads of state to accept the freedoms of everyday people was an issue at hand.  And yes events may seem predictable and possibly cheesy but when you dig a little deeper you can find a lot of meaning in Michael Sloan's screenplay.A couple of the scenes between Carey and Landau are not to be missed.  I can describe it only as highly emotional and awesome performances.  I would recommend you at least go to see the movie for those scenes.And if any marketing/distribution Co. is listening, I contend that The Majestic, if marketed properly, could have competed with A Beautiful Mind in Ticket Sales.

Instead, I was subjected to still another Hollywood wet dream about a blacklisted screenwriter who ends up telling off the House UnAmerican Activities Committee investigation into communists in Hollywood.I'm a fan of Jim Carrey. I especially thought he should have got the Oscar for The Truman Show. Frank Darabont did a terrific job directing The Green Mile and episodes of the Young Indiana Jones Chronicles. They did good jobs on The Majestic, too, as did the supporting cast.I haven't seen the original script but either Michael Sloane's screenplay got rewritten or edited somewhere along the way or it should have been. The storyline deliberately creates suspense then cheats the audience out of it. Forget the coincidence that Peter Appleton is washed up on shore near Luke Trimble's town right when Appleton loses his memory after being blacklisted, though that's a lame set up (and a ripoff of 1965's Mirage, written and directed by blacklistees). But it makes no sense for Peter Appleton to be mistaken for Luke Trimble by Trimble's father and lifelong girlfriend if it isn't going to turn out that Trimble had suffered a previous war-related bout of amnesia and really was Trimble. The ultimate cheat is the piano scene where amnesiac Appleton plays boogie-woogie piano only to have a character who said he taught that piece to Trimble later reverse himself and say he was lying. Plot writing like this just stinks.It's also bad character writing for the amoral, no-conviction Appleton to be mistaken for the courageous Trimble merely on the basis of a physical resemblance. Even through amnesia, good writing would have had character tell.But, you see, these plot contrivances are merely for the purpose of setting up Appleton's telling off the Congressional investigating committee with First Amendment rhetoric. It's been a Hollywood catachism for decades that HUAC's investigation (always confused with McCarthy's senate investigation of communists in the U.S. State Department) was a witch hunt. Never mind that HUAC uncovered not only communist but also Nazi and fascist subversive terror cells in the United States, and post 9/11 subversive terror cells hiding behind the Bill of Rights doesn't seem as righteous as it once might have.But I guess you can't blame screenwriter Michael Sloane for having the real world bite him in the ass.

And besides, it just doesn't look good.I will say, before I climb on my soapbox, that the movie itself is very good.  Jim Carrey delivers an Oscar caliber performance and unlike most supposed feel-good movies, I actually walked out of the theater feeling good.  It's like eating a homemade dinner at your Grandma's house.  The combination of the hearty food made from a recipe she most likely learned before you were born, and the relics of her past in plain sight around you, makes one nostalgic for a time one was not alive to fully appreciate.But the poor showing of the movie at the box-office and a slew of poor critical reviews indicates that it has drawn the ire of some viewers, be it they're deeply conservative or just plain confused.  The heart of the story centers around the McCarthy Communist witch-hunts of the 1950's.  It's one of the more shameful chapters in American history, and in an environment such as this, some may think it best that it's not brought up.  It raises criticisms of the American government.Certain critics will destroy this movie, while recommending transparent acts of audience pandering such as Pearl Harbor or Behind Enemy Lines.  I can't necessarily blame them; they're just concrete thinkers.  In those two films, it's as clear as day who the bad guy is In Pearl Harbor, it's us against the Japanese.  In Behind Enemy Lines, it's us against the Bosnians and NATO obstinance.But in The Majestic, its us against us, and therein lies the problem.  Being that the film was set into production last year, they had no way of knowing about the events of September eleventh.  But if this film were released next year with such a tragedy behind them, it would still be necessary to see this movie.  This country is in a Gung-Ho state, and many people feel that we should get the bad guy no matter what.  But what The Majestic shows is that if we try to defeat what we fear by breaking our own rules, it seals our certain doom.  It shows that America is something we keep in our hearts and in our minds, not something we slap on our bumper or have put on a t-shirt.It emphasizes feelings and thoughts over products and molds, and it should damn well be acknowledged.*** out of 4 "}{"Title":"Lightweight depiction","Date":"28 December 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  This film, directed by the usualy reliable Frank Darabont features Jim Carrey as a blacklisted hollywood screenwriter who suffers amnesia and winds up in a small town where he is mistaken for a young man lost in the war. While harmless and entertaining enough on its own, the film's portrayl of the blacklist and the McCarthy hearings is a tad too light, especially in light of todays climate in which these sort of witch hunts are starting to come back into style (see Ashcroft, John).

As far as I am concerned, this one I will buy on video when it comes out, and I would rank it a 12 or higher if I could, so I have to settle for a 10.

First and foremost, i think that Jim Carrey probably should have attempted a few more mid ground movies before attempting this one, because i still cant shake his Ace Ventura persona. Second, where as the Green Mile and Shawshank really grabbed at emotion, the Majestic makes attempts to do this so incredibly obvious that it comes off as sometimes cheesy.  Third, the movie would have worked much better without the first act.  Fourth, the movie isn't exciting enough to sustain its 2 and 1/2 hour runtime. On to the good the acting is wonderful, and the scenery is perfect for the time it is trying to portray.  The movie really makes you yearn for a town like the one in the movie, where everyone knows everyone. It really relies on the characters as opposed to special effects or the scenery and isn't as gimmicky as the trailer or posters would have you believe.

Was it merely telling a compelling story about an amnesic blacklisted screenwriter assuming the life of a fallen war hero?  Or was it more of a political film condemning McCarthyism and witchhunts and championing the first amendment?  And what does the plot really have to do with the theme?  Anything?I love Frank Darabont as a director.  I think he should direct more films because he does such an amazing job presenting early-to-mid 20th century periods and characters.  I think all 3 of his major films (The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile before this one) are aesthetically beautiful and entertaining.  He cut his teeth as a screenwriter and probably felt somewhat obligated to pay homage to his wronged predecessors by taking on this project.  I really wish he would have involved himself in the script more, though.Jim Carrey does a fine job portraying Peter Appleton, the blacklisted screenwriter who loses his memory and finds himself in a town who mistakes him for somebody else.  And I think it's a film worth watching...I really did enjoy it.  But I'm sure the studio saw this as an Oscar contender and it just isn't solid enough to be there.

Turned out it was O.K., fortunately Ebert and his buddy had reviewed it as well and both given it a Thumbs Up. It's pretty clear to me now that Turan does not get it, I think he kind of misses the point of it all.There are a lot of really bad films out there, this was not one of them. I am no Carrey fan by any means, I tend to avoid his films although I am still curious about Grinch and eventually might like to view it, who knows. But Carrey did not bring any harm to this film, that is the point I wanted to make. His part could have been played by any number of currently-available male leads; he played it about more-or-less the same as any of the others would have. The rest of the film works reasonably well, Rifkin & Holbrook (in the McCarthy-esque hearings-backdrop) have decent parts in it and Landau has a more significant role which he carries off competently. It was nice to see James Whitmore as well.I just don't get it with Mr. Turan. Seems like his standard is awfully darned high if you ask me.  Seems to me his job is to help me get to a weekend film I can be OK with, not  to one where I walk out shaking my head, saying, why did I bother?.   Regarding the storyline in the film, I'd bet most of the younger audience has no concept whatsoever of the McCarthy era, and at the very least this thing serves as a vehicle to introduce their vacant minds to it (Mom, what's a communist?). Regarding trains used in the film, there are a couple of errors, kind of amusing.I can understand Mr. Turan's criticisms in a broad sense, some of the individual points he makes are valid. Still, he seems to discourage the movie-goer and I just feel that it was a worthwhile film-fix for the most part.    ----- Mrow "},{"Title":"A Triumph For Jim Carrey","Date":"25 December 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  I really don't like to gush, but I've got to here.

"},{"Title":"Embalmed kitsch","Date":"25 December 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  Watching Allen Garfield, that venerable character actor, play the agent of a fifties Hollywood screenwriter named Peter Appleton (Jim Carrey), a slick opportunist falsely accused of membership in the communist party, it dawned on me that something was wrong.Garfield, a wonderful caricaturist when given crazy material (as in PUTNEY SWOPE and Tarantino's first movie, MY BEST FRIEND'S BIRTHDAY), comes across sheepish and overpolite in the presence of tony stuff. The dialogue the agent is handed lacks flair, and it needs an actor with a bit of Coen Brothers pizzazz--a Michael Lerner, a Tony Shalhoub, how about Alan King? Then I realized, with horror, the secret of everything that's wrong with THE MAJESTICThe director, Frank Darabont, would consider Alan King...TOO EDGY.One of the funniest things I've ever seen was Jim Carrey's appearance on Saturday Night Live playing Jimmy Stewart attacking Jim Carrey (played by another actor). I-I-I-I'm Ji-jim Carrey! he stuttered. I-I-I-I need attention twe-twe-twennyfour hours a DAY! One of the second funniest things I've ever seen was Carrey's appearance on the final episode of The Larry Sanders Show, as himself. Waxing maudlin and smarmy with Garry Shandling's Sanders on his final telecast, Carrey, when they cut to commercial, turned into a vicious, homicidal, narcissistic freak--a psycho version of what we all fear Jim Carrey might be.Why Frank Darabont, who directed THE MAJESTIC, and almost certainly saw both of those performances, thought Carrey was his man for a slice of Jimmy Stewart retroism the likes of which hasn't been seen in a studio movie in sixty years boggles the imagination. And why Darabont, Carrey and Warner Bros. thought this silo full of picket-fence cliches was worthy of an eight-figure budget doesn't just boggle, it stupefies.Carrey's Peter is a sharpie with a hot screenwriting career, a hot babe on his arm, a new Benz, and a date with HUAC--and he plans to sing like Caruso to straighten that little problem out.Carrey as a heartless Sammy Glick seems like a decent jumping-off place for some juicy, cynical yuks. Then Peter cracks up his car, bonks his head, and gets one of those selective cases of amnesia that only exist in movies. (He can remember scenes from THE LIFE OF EMILE ZOLA, but not who he is.) A small town embraces him as their long-lost son Luke--a local hero who, so the town thought, died in the Big One. When HUAC's goons come snooping for their latest prey, a date with small-town destiny is made.This set-up--a slightly politicized version of Preston Sturges' HAIL THE CONQUERING HERO--seems like it might yield the HBO-ish, smarty-pants conceits of something like Gary Ross' PLEASANTVILLE, where our awareness of the phoniness of Ozzie-and-Harriet America is put through subversive paces.PLEASANTVILLE seemed behind the times in its critique of images of Norman Rockwellism that no longer dominate the culture; but at least Ross was cool enough to give us Ozzies and Harriets who, in their dark hours, burn books, enact Jim Crow laws, and try to rape their neighbors in back alleys. Darabont plays this stuff so straight you might think the movie was directed by a Stepford wife. Scene after scene gives us decent, plainspoken folk who honor their fallen dead; give each other comfort in the local diner; erect civic monuments; dance to Pennsylvania 6-5000; and deliver choked-up speeches about Old Glory, Iwo Jima, Thomas Jefferson, Jimmy Stewart, apple pie and Chevrolet. One waits for the other shoe to drop--to discover that Carrey's small-town father (Martin Landau) is having an affair with that Darabont staple, the Poor But Wise Black Man, or that the town has cannibalized the real dead war hero in a nearby basement, or that the town is really full of communists, or Nazis, or body-snatchers... but no such luck. Darabont lopes from one Kodak moment to the next, stretching the movie's thin incidents to a head-crushing two hours and thirty minutes.The one positive thing about THE MAJESTIC is that it will give the lie to the belief that post-9/11 audiences will want sappy, uplifting, patriotic kitsch. There have been more inept movies than THE MAJESTIC this year, but probably none so contemptible--particularly in its coopting of the McCarthy period to make its reactionary social politics seem more...centrist. (We are meant to believe that the First Amendment defends Peter's collegiate flirtation with communism. How would audiences respond if an analogous contemporary character had a brief college flirtation with the Taliban?) Everything about the movie, from the deliberately hoky and artificial clinches between Peter and his mannequinlike small-town girlfriend, to the appearances of equally waxy actors like Hal Holbrook and James Whitmore, has a musty squareness about it, as if moviemaking for Darabont begins and ends with creakers like TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD and INHERIT THE WIND. Darabont is a sucker for pious, defiant speechmaking and homilies about community and courage and the triumph of the human spirit. One suspects that Darabont's infatuation with this stuff derives from a) an unhealthy obsession with Steven Spielberg and b) a career-long tunneling toward the Oscar. But even the Oscars are hipper than this stuff now. Like Lasse Halstrom, Darabont needs to be sent to the showers--for a reeducation in what makes a prestige picture nowadays.Darabont is so stuck in a time warp he would seem to require medication.

Personally, I felt no emotional ties with the characters in the movie.  This might be a spoiler, but I didn't like the fact that the audience knew the real identity of Carrey's character at the beginning of the movie.  I felt that this took some of the interest out of the movie. It just became a matter of time before the other characters in the movie knew. How they were going to come to that realization didn't really matter to me. I didn't feel upset one way or the other.  If we didn't know at the beginning of the movie, then the audience could experience different feelings throughout the movie like betrayal, sadness, a wanting to believe. We as the audience could then connect more with the other characters in the movie, not to mention Carrey's character.  I really did like the way the movie was filmed, mainly the time period setting.

Jim is wonderful in this picture, and the supporting of Landau and Holden, were also great performances.  The story was interesting enough.  The hook was there in the beginning as Jim's character adjust to the new life.  The hook was there when he starts to figure out he's not who everyone thinks he is (the Carrey and Landau scene, with this hook involved, is the best scene I've seen in at the movies this yEAR).

But that's my fault for having high expectations, not really the movie makers fault.  I think about the ending now, and I guess that's how the movie should end... but, for some reason, I don't feel like that's how it should have ended. Darabont is a talented writer and director, and I just don't know how much say he had in changing the Majestic from the script (especially in a movie that was poking fun at how the writer's original ideas gets changed).  But alongside Stephen King, he had turned the Shawshank Redemption as a movie, and in the screenplay, an even better told story than the Stephen King short alone.  The Majestic is long, many have complained, but I rather enjoy sitting down for a long one because there's more than just the Carrey, Landau, and Holden characters you meet along the way in the small town that really help the story too.The Majestic is a great movie.  The story was a good choice in getting through messages of truth, and it's patriotic storyline couldn't have come at a better time.  I enjoyed the performances of Carrey and Landau together.

Frank Darabont directing Jim Carrey could never go wrong. The buzz after some pre-screenings has shown the opposite, so I went into the theater not expecting too much. Fortunately, the buzz missed the mark.This is not the best movie of the year, but it's not far behind. It requires an open mind, as there are a few aspects of the film one can dislike if one really wants to. With an open mind, it is a refreshingly sweet story with quite a bit of sentiment to it. It praises the cinema and it praises the good of man. The word capraesque has been used a lot about this movie, as I agree it should have. The film does reflect Frank Capra's work, and it captures the Capra spirit. I believe the use of capraesque may have worked against the movie, though. Many Capra fans will dislike this film just because some have dared comparing a modern film with the master.The film also deals with patriotism in a more subtle and acceptable manner than what we are used to lately. It includes a witch-hunt for communists and does so with a modern, politically correct view, which may be unsettling for some overly patriotic Americans. This part of the film takes part mostly in the last hour, and I think the film might have been even better if this had been left out, but it is still a very good choice.Jim Carrey is spectacular as the man given the chance of beginning all over again. This is a fascinating thought, and Carrey interacts with it perfectly. His role is not better than Russell Crowe's (A Beautiful Mind) but if there were any justice in the world, he would at least finally win his nomination. However, I think both Jim Carrey and me have given up on that hope after him being ripped off twice already.It is also a joy to see the classical beauty Laurie Holden.

This warm and fuzzy movie is perfect for the holidays and has quite a bit going for it. Darabont continues his pattern of using nostalgic settings, loveable characters, and a sense of wonder that recalls Capra, Spielberg and Stephen King (his non-horror works). Carrey does a fine job in yet another serious role. Although he may not get nominated for any awards, he does a fine job and it should be noted that he has diversity and can handle a serious role just as well as a comedic one.With a running time of two-and-a-half hours, this one goes by pretty quickly. The film is easy to follow and all of the acting is quite good, especially Martin Landau's performance. The post-WWII mentality is pretty striking, especially after the events of September 11th. The patriotic moments should strike a chord with many viewers. Although some scenes are shamefully tearjerkers, they work well to get the viewer involved with the characters. The only cheesy sequence is a predictable yet silly courtroom scene towards the end. Overall, this is a good movie to take the family or a date to. It's not necessarily a masterpiece, but quite enjoyable and timely. Fans of Carrey or Darabont will not be disappointed.

Martin Landau's performance is also wonderful as the father who thinks his dead son has returned from being missing in action from WW2.  The movie gets a little bit too much of the Rah Rah, let's go up against the big, bad government and win bit near the end, but on the whole the story holds together pretty well.  The period clothes, sets, props and cars seem to be dead on 1951.

Her performance just breaks your heart as the girl who hopes that Carrey really is Luke come back to life, but in her heart knows he isn't him. Their scenes where they get to know each other and fall in love are wonderful and Ms. Holden moves through them with a wonderful naturalness. I was very, very impressed with her.  Her background seems to be mostly in television, but her performance here shoots her into the ranks of promising young stars who should go on to great things.All in all, it's a wonderful movie, a little bit too long, but not enough that you will be shifting around in your seat and looking at your watch.

After outstanding dramatic performances in Man On the Moon (which should have gotten him an Oscar nomination) and The Truman Show, Carrey still can't escape his take as a rubber-faced goon in such films as Ace Ventura and Dumb and Dumber. But he's not about to give in. As Peter, Carrey creates a well-rounded reluctant hero.  He is careful to balance the complex duality of his character(s), alternately subdued and enthusiastic, only occasionally, lapsing into melodrama.  The supporting cast does just that, supports the main character, with the exception of Martin Landau, who gives a touching portrayal of father who has rediscovered life through his son.Frank Darabont films share three common elements they're set in prison, they're long, and I like them - and The Majestic is no exception (except for the prison aspect). Unlike the last amnesiac-as-protagonist film I saw (Memento - which I thought was excellent)  Majestic is far less cynical and dare I say, a feel good piece. Darabont's team has created the ideal small town feel, populated with quirky characters and totally divorced from the hustle of Hollywood. I do have a few concerns however.At 2 ¬Ω hours, the film runs a bit long - I think they could have trimmed it down by at least 15 minutes without losing any substantial elements.  My main complaint is that the Mr Smith Goes to Washington style speech near the end of the film, and it's consequences do not mesh  (further elaboration would ruin the ending).The Majestic is the kind of film that people want to see at Christmas -it's light, requires little thought and will leave you with a warm feeling inside (even though you'll probably feel a bit manipulated).

He said, ''I got to shoot it in black and white, the dolly bumped when it was moving, and the set looks a little cardboard . . . . It was perfect!'' Would that the rest of the movie had this charm.Darabont must have been counting his money from `Shawshank Redemption' and `The Green Mile'; Jim Carrey must have been remembering he pulled off `Truman Show.'  Probably distracted by these successes, neither director nor star apparently read this insipid screenplay closely or watched the sophomoric daily's because they surely would have known they created one of the worst films this year, and maybe ever.Darabont presents Carrey as a writer in the &#145;50's accused of being a communist. After he has recovered from amnesia and started a new life in an idyllic town, Carrey gives a courtroom speech at the end about the constitution, probably inspired by Jimmy Stewart's patriotic Capracorn in `Mr. Smith goes to Washington.' But Darabont plays it all for the syrup, where Capra deftly showed the underside of American freedom while he praised it.All issues in this movie are telegraphed by way of the most cliched stereotypes ever assembled in one film, from the blond, blue eyed childhood sweetheart and her benevolent town doctor father to the cynical, disabled misfit who finally turns good.

He yearns to be taken seriously almost to the point of desperation. Unfortunately, he isn't successful but he does show promise.  At the height of sadness he looks strained, when he's in love he looks like he's ready to burst out laughing and at the absolute breaking point he is not nearly angry enough.  Maybe he under acted as an attempt to show the calmer, more sophisticated fifties or maybe he just needs to work on it a little bit. He is likable in Majestic but he is lacking the one major element every dramatic actor needs to play off of, conflict.It's 1951 and Peter Appleton (Carrey) is a successful screen writer.  His first B-movie, Sand Pirates of the Sahara, has just hit the big screen, he's dating the film's beautiful star and he has another picture, Ashes to Ashes, in the works.  The early 1950's were a dark era for Hollywood. The government had developed committees that blacklisted members of the entertainment industry because of their political ties, particularly ties to the communist party.  Peter was not immune.  He found himself suddenly, unwittingly labeled a communist.  The studio stopped production of Ashes to Ashes, his girlfriend left him and the House Un-American Activities Committee launched a full scale investigation.Disheartened and alone, Peter decides to drive away from his troubles. His plan goes awry, however, when his car goes off a bridge.  He wakes up on a beach outside a small town called Lawson with no memory of his previous existence.  Martin Landau, who plays Harry Trimble, discovers Peter and is convinced that he is his son, Luke Trimble.  Luke was a World War II soldier who was missing in action and presumed dead.  The town embraces their long lost son while Luke's girlfriend, Adele, played by Laurie Holden, does her best to help him get his memory back.A new spirit of adventure is awakened in Harry and he decides to reopen his theater, The Majestic, which was closed shortly after the war.  Reluctant at first, Peter finally espouses his would-be father's attitude and organizes the reconstruction of the once proud cinema house.  The entire town soon gets energized with Majestic fever.  Everyone does anything and everything they can do to help out.  Peter is discovering a new-found sense of belonging and celebrating his own re-awakening.  But his past is about to catch up with him.The most touching aspect of The Majestic is the post-World War II mentality.  Lawson lost a lot of young men to the war and the struggle for the families to recover even six years later is aided by one of their own returning.  The mayor, who lost two sons in the war,  declares that seeing Luke was like seeing one of his own boys coming home.  In a city where the WWII memorial is kept in a Town Hall basement because it's just too painful to display, Luke is welcomed with open arms.  It is because of Peter that Lawson begins to heal after a long period of mourning.The only real strife in the movie is the fear that Peter will remember his real identity and the fact that the FBI is looking for and will eventually catch up to him.  Unfortunately, the terrifying ordeal that was the Hollywood Blacklist was barely touched upon.  Also, the real committee meetings in Hollywood were far more severe than the ones portrayed in The Majestic. But, it is the underlying message that far exceeds any turmoil that Peter encounters.  The theme remember the heroes of WWII was almost as profound in this film as it was in any WWII action movie.  Heroes are honored and fallen sons are remembered in an affecting tribute.The Majestic is a feel-good movie, albeit a long one (nearly two and a half hours).  Peter described his new film as a portrayal of pain, nobility and the human condition and that could be said The Majestic as well. It's a nice journey of love, courage and honor but not a lot of anything else. But, in this time when heroes are being honored almost daily, The Majestic's poignant memorials are even more vital.  We must never forget the men and women who served in WWII.  They are the generation that saved the world and The Majestic is one movie that lets them know their sacrifices will never be forgotten.

Occasionally and irrationally, we allow these tyrants to segregate us according to conforming ideology and briefly appear too powerful to stop. Yet, it is often a single individual who initiates the courageous task of standing up to them. A good example is this exceptional story called  The Magestic  which was written by Michael Slone. It tells the story of Peter Appleton (Jim Carrey, superior performance) a notable writer of the 1950's who's written screenplay comes under the myopic scrutiny of Congressman Doyal (Hal Holbrook), the Committee of Un-American Activities and their agent (Bob Balaban). Suspected of being a communist sympathizer Appleton's studio contract is canceled and he is summoned before the totalitarian committee. Dispondent and depressed he goes for a drunken ride in his car, crashes off a bridge and ends up on a beach. There he is saved, nursed back to health and surprisingly resurrected as a lost son and hero of WWII. Suffering from Amneisia, he accepts the premise, he is the returning Medal of Honor son of Harry Trimble (Martin Landau). David Ogden Stiers, James Whitmore, Brent Briscoe and Laurie Holden, all play townsfolk who are convinced Appleton is Luke Trimble. His return stirs life back into the town and enough energy to resurrect the Town's only theater called the Majestic. However, the witch hunting committee seeks him out and gives him an impossible choice, one which will scar him for life. This film is a sobering role for Carrey and one which will endear him to his many fans as he creates a Classic with enough power to crown his already magnificent career.

If I had to make one key observation about this movie, it would be that if they took each separate storyline which actually made sense and built maybe 3 or 4 different movies around that theme, all four of those movies could have been decent movies. But the writer decided to take those three or four incompatible themes and fit them into one movie.

But I liked it.","Date":"24 September 2007","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" Jim Carrey first started off by basically contorting his elastic face and making a career out of it. He's an energetic actor to be sure. And sometimes he succeeds. In films like The Mask and The Grinch. But sometimes he goes far off the mark, like Liar Liar and Bruce Almighty.In recent years he's tried to show audiences that he has got a serious side. But like his comedies, this has worked to variable effect. People are not always willing to embrace him when he tackles dramatic stuff. Sometimes they do, like the superb The Truman Show. And sometimes they don't, like The Majestic.Directed by Frank Darabont, the man behind The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile, he has crafted a Capraesque fable, with Jim Carrey as the modern day James Stewart.Carrey plays Peter Appleton, a screenwriter living in 1950s Hollywood. His perfect life takes a nosedive when he's accused of being a Communist, because when he was a kid, he attended a Communist meeting for the express purpose of impressing a girl he had the hots for.Blacklisted by the studio, he gets drunk and accidentally drives off a bridge where he suffers a head injury. The next morning he finds himself washed ashore in the town of Lawson, with no memory of who he is. But the townspeople embrace him as Luke Trimble, one of their own lost in WW2. Luke's father Harry (Martin Landau) is overjoyed to have his 'son' back from the dead, and the two work together to restore The Majestic, a cinema they ran in Lawson's heyday. But the FBI are on Peter's trail.When The Majestic was released in 2001, it was quite a sizable box-office flop. And that could have been for any number of reasons. One could be that Jim Carrey fans always treat his serious performances with derision. Maybe the film seems a bit old-fashioned in these cynical post 9/11 days. Or maybe because people just don't go in for heartwarming stories anymore.The Majestic is not without some flaws. Yes it is occasionally a little too sentimental. And the town of Lawson is a world that only exists in the mindset of Frank Capra and his acolytes. But I did enjoy this film. Quite a bit actually.Of all the performances Jim Carrey has given, this must rank as the sanest. He has never played it so straight in anything else. Not even in The Truman Show. And its such a rare pleasure to see him in something that doesn't involve manic mugging and facial contortions. He's quite well suited to the part because he brings an amiable affability in the vein of James Stewart, and despite initial doubts, it doesn't take long for him to convince us of his situation.I must admit that I am a bit of a sucker for films that celebrate the movie-going experience. Films like Matin√©e and The Purple Rose of Cairo. The Majestic is not on their level, perhaps because for a time it embraces that quality, but then shelves it aside in the third act. But I did enjoy the scenes of Peter/Luke and Harry restoring The Majestic cinema, and seeing it in all its glory brought satisfaction to my heart.Typically being a Frank Darabont film, The Majestic has a sizable running time. But even at 2 1/2 hours I barely noticed. Perhaps because Darabont has that ability to bring an essentiality to his storytelling and characters. The finest example being The Shawshank Redemption. He went a little overboard in The Green Mile, but nonetheless, Darabont's films are always intensely watchable.And as usual, Darabont has assembled another top-drawer cast of characters. Best of all is Martin Landau. The situation called for here could have been ripe with clich√©s and although there are one or two, Landau being the great actor that he is avoids most of them through his acting. He brings the right dash of sincerity that the film so desperately needs, which is what allows The Majestic to transcend its occasionally ropey storyline.I also liked Laurie Holden as Adele, Luke's one-time girlfriend. She makes for an appealing love interest, and quite lights up the screen whenever she's around. David Ogden Stiers is on good form as Adele's father, who asks a lot of the right questions a lesser film wouldn't dare to ask. And Gerry Black is good value as the cinema usher who sees right through 'Luke', but preserves the lie to pave the way for a greater happiness.In the final act, when Peter recovers his memory and stands before Congress, it has to be said it becomes rather heavy-handed and moralistic. And although it's leavened by some welcome doses of Carrey's trademark humour, I still think the ending is just a little too predictable.But nonetheless, The Majestic has some fine unexpected qualities. Watched through a cynical eye, its mawkish, trite and unpalatable. Watched through a hopeful eye, its refreshing, courteous and in these cold, post 9/11 days, that much more welcome.

I realize some will dismiss the film because of its Rockwell-like sentiment (and because it's fashionable to dislike anything that's too sentimental these days), but I also think the story is balanced by an undertone of nasty, ugly reality. Remember, Jim Carrey's screenwriter is thrown into a rather spectacular series of events which end up with him taking an adventure in an almost latter-day Wonderland. A credit to his dramatic acting ability, he has a kind of wary disconnection throughout the whole film.

But every Oz must have its Kansas, and even Carrey 'wakes up' towards the end of the film to deal with the ugliness of the HUAC witch-hunt. But my favorite performer- and indeed the best thing in the movie- is Martin Landau. His patriarch who wears his heart on his sleeve is absolutely stunning throughout, and he gives the story a lot of earnestness and optimism (especially when he talks about the magic of movies- which I admit I kind of agree with).

It was amidst everything from the releases like HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE and ALI. And that's what explains this film's dismal box office totals. The Jim Carrey movie seemed to be underrated for the most part and that it wasn't able to grab the attention like the films I mentioned. Truly, this was a gem that theater-goers definitely missed big time. In this movie, not only it pictures that old Hollywood feeling, there was something Jim Carrey fans (a majority of them) missed out on. For those that synonymously put him his usual crazy world, this was something for them to see BIG in a different way -- which means, he can certainly do good drama -- like his past credits in THE TRUMAN SHOW and MAN ON THE MOON! Carrey is getting good at it as he dons the 'drama' part once again in this movie. Playing Peter Appleton, he leads us all to a great journey --- of what is happening before him when Hollywood is accused of spreading Communism (a part of the times during that era) thus being watched over by the FBI -- and later entering a different world, of where a part of America puts forth it's values through a small town's pride in their young who sacrificed themselves for the love of the country. After being in a car accident and unable to remember himself, Appleton is taken by a stranger into this town called Lawson and that's where the magic begins from here. He's assumed by many to be one of their heroes named Luke Trimble. The likeness of Appleton and Trimble resemble each other strongly. Appleton becomes embraced by many, including Trimble's father (Martin Landau), who believed his son came back 9 1/2 years later. He later meets Trimble's beloved gal Adele whom Appleton soon will fall in love with, and many more of the town's finest people. I can't say more about the rest. You'll just have to see it. This film will certainly win your heart and I encourage many to see it once it's on rent or for sale at video stores everywhere. My girlfriend and I have. And we really loved it. This movie can breathe in new life through it's release on video and capture more hearts (for those that missed it in theaters). It'll become a cult classic!  Totally majestic all the way!

The experience of the journey is basically the same, as you're covering the same ground, only quicker.  The main difference is that once you reach your destination now, you can actually appreciate it more because you're not so worn out from the trip itself.  Interestingly enough, `The Majestic,' directed by Frank Darabont, is set in the early &#145;50s, and uses the pre-Interstate route to take you to the final destination.  The thing is, had Darabont opted for the two hour route (which was available), he would have taken his audience to the same place and it would have been entirely more effective.  Especially since, once you finally arrive, you realize that you've been there before, anyway.  Even so, like visiting an historic landmark, it's worth a look.  But be prepared; the journey is long, and it may wear you down a bit.Peter Appleton (Jim Carrey) is a `B' movie Hollywood screenwriter, but he's working on a project now that just may take him to the `A' list.  This is his big chance, and he's going to make the most of it; this is the one that's going to take him to the top.  Right in the middle of it, however, there's a glitch-- and it's a big one  The McCarthy hearings are in full swing, Peter's name has been given to the committee, and he's been called to testify.  And his movie-- along with his future-- has been put on hold.Shocked and dismayed at having the rug pulled out from under him, Peter gets in his car that night and hits the highway, driving just to drive, to get away, letting the road take him where it may until the sun comes up or he runs out of gas, whichever comes first.  Neither of which happens, though, as fate intervenes; he has an accident, and when he comes to he's lying on a beach somewhere, with no idea who he is or why he's there.  But there's still some luck left in the hand he's holding, and his name is Stan Keller (James Whitmore), who is out for his morning stroll when he finds Peter, befriends him and takes him into town.  And it's there that Peter's life really begins to change, when a man named Harry Trimble (Martin Landau) spots him and mistakes him for his son, Luke-- gone some nine years and thought lost at war.  For Harry-- and for the whole town-- it's like a miracle; as if they've all been given a second chance.  Because Luke-- thought gone forever-- has come back.Darabont has crafted and delivered a film that initially (for the first forty-five minutes or so) is alive in a Bradburyesque way that is filled with hope and the stuff that dreams are made of.  It's the story of a man wronged who not only gets a second chance, but a chance at something seemingly better than what he had before.  Something cleaner, somehow; pure.  But once Darabont has established the magic, he enters a holding pattern.  Peter may not know who he is, but we do, and we know it's only a matter of time before his true identity is revealed.  In the meantime, the magic slowly begins to dissipate in the realization that Peter's story is really nothing more than a smoke-and-mirrors act, behind which lies the true purpose of Darabont's film.  What we begin to understand is that the Peter Appleton character is nothing more than a vehicle through which a statement can be made about McCarthyism and the injustice it wrought upon the lives of a number of innocent people.  `The Majestic' then, is a cinematic hybrid; the offspring of a union between `Something Wicked This Way Comes' and `Guilty by Suspicion.'  An interesting concept, to be sure, and fairly well executed by Darabont.  But you leave home for a specific destination, only to find you're elsewhere once you arrive.  And Darabont takes you there via the scenic route; better had he taken the alternate route, as there is nothing along his route that makes the beginning or the end any more significant, entertaining or noteworthy in any way.  The saving grace of the project is Jim Carry, who leaves his rubber face behind this time and gives a performance that is truly `majestic.'  The most significant aspect of this film, in fact, is that it demonstrates what a gifted, talented actor Carrey is.  His portrayal of Peter Appleton is quite natural and unaffected, he exhibits an unusual (for him) amount of restraint while using an introspective approach to the character, and there is a decided lack of pretentiousness in his presentation that makes him entirely real and convincing.  It's a performance that should prove to his detractors, once and for all, that there is more to Jim Carrey than `Ace Ventura' or `Lloyd Christmas.' As the man who gets the ball rolling by mistaking Peter for his own son, Martin Landau gives an affecting performance, although he could've taken a cue from Carrey in the restraint department, as he tends a bit too much toward melodrama at times.  Still, it's an engaging portrayal and does, indeed, effect the desired results.The supporting cast includes Laurie Holden (Adele), Allen Garfield (Leo), Amanda Detmer (Sandra), Bob Balaban (Elvin Clyde), Brent Briscoe (Sheriff Coleman), Jeffrey DeMunn (Ernie), Hal Holbrook (Congressman Doyle), Ron Rifkin (Kevin), David Ogden Stiers (Doc Stanton) and Karl Bury (Bob).  `The Majestic' then, is something of a mixed bag; it's an engaging film, but Darabont allows the emotional involvement to waver somewhat during the journey, before successfully reestablishing it at the end.  And the outer shell masks the fact that there's also a nut inside, along with the milk chocolate.  In the final analysis, however, it's still the magic that is the movies.  7/10.

But if he was, he definitely deserved it over Denzel.  Carrey is nothing short of spectacular, giving one of the best screen performances I've seen in a while.  Now, I liked him in The Truman Show.  He definitely proved that he had great potential as a dramatic actor and gave a fine dramatic performance, but not Oscar-worthy.  And the film wasn't Oscar-worthy either, though it was good.  Well, I wouldn't regard The Majestic as Oscar-worthy, but I guess Carrey has a lot more to work with in the rich, multi-layered character of Peter Appleton.  Before I go on with the aesthetics of this film, I will let out what I really think of Jim Carrey.  He is a talented man, he has lots of it.  But his relentless jarring, in comic roles, does get quite tiring at times.  When I was in grade school, I thought the Ace Ventura movies were hilarious.  Now I can't stand a minute of either one of those flicks because of Carrey's annoying schtick.  So I was initially glad, while watching The Majestic, that Carrey was able to discipline himself and provoke himself from breaking into one of his manic episodes.  Now Robin Williams is known as a comic actor, but he is so great in his dramatic roles that I can honestly say he's just as talented at drama as he is at comedy.  And before watching Carrey's performance in this movie, Williams was the only comic actor who I felt had that kind of talent.  Just by this one performance, I can regard Carrey as a spectacular dramatic actor and I anxiously hope to see him in many more serious roles, despite how poor this one fared at the box office.  Screw what the general public says--put Jim Carrey in more serious roles!  We've seen enough of his a*s-talking. The most powerful scenes in this movie actually contain no dialogue.  Carrey's expressions alone communicate such deep emotional pain and sorrow.  He brought tears to my eyes in a great many scenes with his quietly powerful performance.  Frank Darabont must've had a hell of a hunch when he decided to cast Carrey in the lead role.  Needless to say, Carrey wouldn't be the conventional choice.  This looks like a role that would require a Tom Hanks.  Who would guess Jim Carrey?  As I said, why didn't he receive an Oscar nomination?  The story has its flaws, but overall it's quite interesting.  It has many dimensions.  Darabont and the writers blended the magic of early cinema, the Communist scare in the 50's, wartime heroism, a case of mistaken idenitity, romance and the triumph of the human spirit all into one film.  This is no fluff flick.  But it does have its dramatic conventions.  For example, the death of Luke's father, played wonderfully by Martin Landau.  Usually when you see a frail, elderly old man in a film like this, he's bound to die and die in a opera-like fashion with him muterring his last words to the one he loves.  It was sad to see his character die, but that was one moment that didn't choke me up because I expected it to happen.  Now I loved Carrey's speech at the end, pertaining to America's increased paranoia about Communism, and that was another moment that brought a tear to my eye, but let's face it--at a time like that, would they really allow him to return to Hollywood and write films, despite how powerful his words were?  Of course not.  But we wouldn't end such an uplifting drama with our beloved protagonist in prison.  And after Appleton revealed to the town that he was a fraud, would they really forgive him afterwards and hold another Welcome Back party for him?  And finally, there's the romance.  BTW, Laurie Holden--who I don't recall seeing before--also gives a superb performance.  Well, she naturally despises him after finding out that he's not really Luke.  Then he meets her in the semetary and she immediately forgives him and even offers him inspiration in the court case.  OK, it's established.  The Majestic is not a perfect motion picture.  Towards the end, it does falter into melodrama.  And it's never truly established why the townspeople mistook Peter Appleton for Luke.  Did the two of them just happen to look exactly alike?  I know they weren't long lost identical twins. Nevertheless, The Majestic is a powerful film with a powerful performance by Carrey, and I do suggest you have a box of tissues handy.  Darabont directed The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile, so he knows how to tug at the audience's heartstrings and generate layers of emotional tension.  Why did this movie bomb at the box office?  Simple  The general public would rather watch Jim Carrey talk with his rear end.  Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but there's none of his trademark butt-talking this time around.  Instead, Carrey chooses to let down his audience's expectations by delivering a great performance that will send you on an emotional journey.  Oh, boo-hoo.  We don't wanna see that, do we?

It is ambitious in dealing with three main topics, but pulls it off well, if not perfectly.some SPOILERS follow -- Set in the early 1950s USA, Pete is a B-movie script writer who once, in college, attended a meeting of an organization that was believed affiliated with Communists. Why? Because he was horny, trying to win the affections of a girl he followed there. Still, the House Committee on Unamerican Activities learned of this years later, and he was destined for the Holloywood blacklist. Distraught, he went for a long ride up into northern California (much was shot in Mendocino), got into an accident (I would have run over the possum), hit his head, was discovered the next day on a river bank by an old man who walked him into town.Pete had no memory, was mistaken by townsfolk, even the dad, for Luke who had been missing from the war and presumed dead. Had he really shown up after 9 1/2 years? Everyone wanted to believe so, even his old girl who was about to get her law license. But those close to Luke began to realize this person was probably not him. Still, after losing so many young men to the war, this Luke was the inspiration for the town to re-awaken itself and quit mourning over their losses. This was manifest in part by the refurbishing and re-opening of the movie house, The Majestic, which Luke and his dad had run before the war. It was during the showing of one movie, Pete had written, that he began to remember who he really was.Daniel VonBargen in a small but good role was the agent who got onto Pete's track and finally found him in the small town, brought him back to L.A. for a special session of the HCUA, where his stand on Communism was to be questioned. In the process he realized what a milquetoast he was, always doing what was easiest to save his skin, but realizing how much the small town gave honor to hero Luke. Which got him to change his attitude, gave up script writing, returned to Luke's hometown, married Luke's old girlfriend, continued to run the Majestic, raised a family.The film is ambitious in tackling three issues -- the nation's obsession with Communism at that time, Pete's finding himself, and the town re-awakening after its terrible losses of young men to the war. It handles all three acceptably, and the overall result is a fine film. Especially enjoyable is the middle hour and a half where Pete is meeting all these people he is supposed to remember, and the effort to re-open the Majestic. Fun scene, night dance, old piano teacher tries to get Luke to play classical, but Pete starts to play great jazz instead. The DVD's extras are not particularly enticing, but the DVD itself, in Dolby 5.1 digital sound, is very impressive. It is done so well it rarely calls attention to itself. But, in scenes that benefit from it, the surround sound puts you right in the middle of a crowd or the street, with sounds from all around.Edit June 2011, just watched it again, holds up very well for repeat viewings.

Although by no means is this a failure in creative terms for Frank Darabont, it is a colossal one in terms of the box office. The Majestic sank without trace and the fact I had to travel almost 100 miles to enjoy it over here indicates that UK audiences will reciprocate their US counterparts. Now the critics knives are out, Darabont cannot hack non-Stephen King adaptations, mismanages when outside a prison set. Absolute cack. This particlar feature may lack the beauty of a Shawshank or the spiritual drive of a Green Mile but it is certainly no flop. The flashback it provides to a an age long forgotten is one that should be applauded, however politically uncorrect it appears in its convictions. Darabont here is doing what Daranbont loves best, and for the most part it works. For one, the whole tale is a delight with the relationships between Carrey, Landau and Black a particular joy. The reflections on a golden age of cinema is also one to be heralded, if not slightly overdone come the 150 minute mark. The settings and direction is faultless and never at any moment does the film outstay its welcome. Indeed, there are touches of the Coens, Hitchcock and Capra here all at play. However, where The Majestic shoots itself in the foot is in an overly simplistic script that is just too sugar coated and in many ways an eagerness on Darabont's part to not become perceived as above his station. Darabont as we speak is in his writing bureau at home penning the remake of Farenheit 451 and I just wish he had spent the time to reword much of Sloanes' trite vocabulary. Some scenes are startingly brilliant, like the moment when Appleton takes a stand in the graveyard and pronounces that this is where devotion to a cause gets you. However, these are too few and far between and the penning of Darabont is clearly lacking. The constitution is lauded in a fashion that drips like syrup and the whole picture takes the role of a political fable come the last half hour. Another worry is Darabont's total moulding of the film around its script. Indeed, this is no bad thing as a strong script makes a film. However, the whole last act seems so staged it becomes passe. There is no way the whole of the council would have stopped short to allow Appleton his moment to personally uphold the constitiution. This is becoming a trend it seems as we only have to hark back three years to The Green Mile to see Edgecombe and Coffey in a deep moment of heartfelt pity whilst a baying crowd allow them the time to weep internally for one another. What must be remembered is that a strong script does not have to be given a soap box, it whittles its own. Despite its shortcomings, The Majestic is a throwback to the darling days of cinema, and this is hardly an area of the market that is becoming saturated of late. However badly it tries to become an adage to the founder fathers of cinema and however innapropriate it is given that McCarthyism flourished in small town America, it still deserves our respect. It is a far more polished film than the majority of celluloid pap that flood our cinema screen each month. Those are the artificial films, not this. The fact that it will be overshone by a science fiction licence that has long outstayed its welcome and teen sexual angst at the box office is a shame but not unexpected. If Darabont does as expected, and becomes his own cinematic one man band once again for his next production, I think we will see him come roaring back. Something we should all encourage, for the story in Hollywood is in its twilight years, and it is the likes of Darabont that keeps that moon aglow.

In the beginning and end of The Majestic, the viewer focuses on Jim Carey's face as studio hacks come up with stupid and hokey ideas to improve his script. I'm afraid this explains some of the serious flaws of The Majestic.  The film lacks originality, intensity and tightness of editing.  It is Too Long! It tries too hard to be Capra-esque and similar to too many other better films.  Some of the fine movies it shamelessly borrowed from include Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, It's a Wonderful Life, The Return of Martin Guerre, The Front, Cinema Paradiso, and who knows what others? Jim Carey lacks the intensity and emotion of Jimmy Stewart, though He tries hard.  He did a much more credible job in The Truman Show.  Laurie Holden has done a good turn for her career with her performance, though the director overdone her 40's look.  The tried and true character actors, Landau, Balaban, Stiers, et al. were believable and were responsible for the best moments in the film. The Majestic tried too hard.

Peter Appleton (Jim Carrey) is a writer, for movies. Sand Pirates of the Sahara, his new 'B' movie has just come out. Then suddenly he is accused of being a Communist, and after having a few drinks decides to go for a drive. While crossing a single lane bridge, an opossum runs out onto the bridge. Swerving to avoid it, the man's car runs off the side of the bridge, and eventually falls into the river below. After finally getting out of the car (his jacket was caught in the door, which he had to take off, which had his wallet in it) the rushing river slams him against one of the bridge's supports. Next we see him lying on a beach, which a large gash on his head. He is suffering from amnesia, and cannot remember who he is, etc. An old man finds him, and takes him into a local diner where everyone agrees that he looks strangely familiar. Harry Trimble (Martin Landau) sees him as he is leaving and recognizes him as Luke Trimble, his son. We learn that Luke never returned from the war, as well as many others. Then we come to some very slow parts of the movie, basically of everyone in town badgering Luke, trying to get him to remember. Then come Adele Stanton (Laurie Holden), Luke's old flame. She too tries to get him to remember things, and he still does not. Later, `Luke', Harry and the rest of the Majestic's staff, with the help of the townspeople, reopen the Majestic. Now come some more very slow parts of the movie. The next big event is when Sand Pirates of the Sahara is shown at the Majestic. Suddenly Luke remembers who he really is... Pete Appleton, not Luke Trimble. Just then, he's informed that the something is wrong because Harry missed the reel change. Rushing to him, they find him lying on the ground. It ends up he's had a massive heart attack, and is going to die. Peter almost tells him he's not Luke, but decides not to. He then tells Adele after Harry's funeral, and she says she knew all along. The police, etc. show up in town to get suspected Communist Peter, and he has to be on a train in the morning. Then the movie gets slow once again, and before leaving in the morning he goes to the cemetery to put back the award that Harry had given him, thinking he was Luke, from the war. He finds Adele there. They fight about what Luke would've done in this situation. Then he leaves for the train station. Once there, 'Doc' (David Ogden Stiers), Adele's father, gives Peter a gift from Adele. He opens it on the train and it's the constitution. He is tried in front of a committee and takes a stand, talking about the America Luke fought for. He leaves and returns to work, where he promptly says what he really thinks, and leaves. He returns and receives a welcome from the entire town. He marries Adele, has a son and runs the Majestic.     It doesn't get much cheesier than that. I think that the movie had a great potential, but was made too long. But perhaps if it weren't that long, it wouldn't have had the same impact because the character's relationships wouldn't have developed enough. I could tell the people around me didn't enjoy it; they were continually checking their watches and fidgeting. It grew very slow at times. Although I didn't mind sitting through it, I would not see it again for a long time. I thought the acting was excellent.

Hollywood screenwriter Jim Carrey is involved in a car wreck one day and develops amnesia. He is then taken to a small town by an elderly man (James Whitmore) where he is mistaken for a man who was seemingly lost in World War II. A true mystery becomes a nostalgic journey into the land of films as the titled movie theater is re-opened with Carrey's help. Martin Landau is really taken with Carrey, believing that Carrey is his son. Most of the rest of the town welcomes Carrey in with open arms, but some question Carrey's legitimacy. As time passes too many side-stories hurt The Majestic. The black-listing of those involved in Communist activities in Hollywood during the post-World War II era and a sometimes distracting love story get in the way of some really good ideas.

A simple tale set in the 50's, a young man is accused of being a Communist and his life is turned upside down. One night he gets slightly drunk and drives his car off a bridge accidentally and ends up almost drowning. He gets washed up on the shores of a small town where he is believed to be a WWII soldier killed years before.This is complete and utter American pie through n through and I mean that in the best way possible. Generally things like this can be quite sickening with all the Stars n Stripes patriotism and this does have that, truth be told this actually has more treacly gooey hanky moments than you can shake a stick at. There is also the element of the all American Communist witch hunts which is the whole plot beneath the surface. Its only kinda touched on really but its played out in a typically heroic way for the main character in the end. You think he will submit to the government, a government of so called democracy, but he fights for truth and justice and the American way. Yes the finale is a bit too vomit inducing for us non Americans. What works for me is the pure visual spectacle of the film with the typically quaint white building built US town set amongst the glorious Californian woodlands on the pacific coast. In short this film looks stunning, its made to look extremely whimsical of course but it works. The era makes this work even better as the sight of old classic US cars cruising around, small diners, the smart fashions, jazz/big band music etc...give the film a very homely taste that I think anyone (more so adults probably) can enjoy.The cast is another reason to like this film, how can you not enjoy seeing Martin Landau in a brilliantly moving role. I loved 'Ed Wood' and this yet another portrayal of angst and heartbreak but even stronger than before. Gerry Black also gives us a lovely performance for the old caretaker of the Majestic, his gravelly raspy voice draws you in whilst his cheeky grin is heartwarming. James Whitmore has a small role but he sure fits in well, performance is perfect as is his costume and character design, looks good with the pipe. To be honest all the main roles are played well by a host of solid actors, many I have seen before and merely know by face, reliable character actors.Then we have Mr Carrey, to be honest a brave move as before this he was known only for his comedies. This doesn't mean he was the right choice of course, in my opinion he can't quite handle the kind of serious emotion involved here (at least at this period in his career) and you can see it. A case of being type cast for over the top crazy ass characters or idiots, due to this you keep half expecting him to do something or say something daft. Carrey never really looks too comfortable in this film surrounded by proper quality character actors, he was yet to break away from his over acting lunacy.A charming nostalgic film that manages to homage the golden age of small town 50's America and the classic (and much missed) age of big regal looking cinemas, but is also a stirring tribute to the fallen of WWII. It is extremely clich√©d and cheesy, love it or hate it I doubt there will be any middle ground here.

The town folk confuse Carrey for one of their missing in action war heroes Luke Tremble. His resemblance to Tremble is so realistic; Luke's father Harry Tremble (Martin Landau) believes whole heartily that is son has returned. Luke and Harry decide to rebuild the movie house known as The Majestic. Hoping to bring life back to a town that has been mourning for 9 ¬Ω years.Frank Darabont is the director of The Majestic. He has been twice nominated for an academy award in the category for Best Adapted Screen Play for his work on The Shawshank Redemption (1994) and The Green Mile (1999). The Majestic is similar to his other films, where Darabont tries to portray what is important in life. In this time post 9/11, Darabont brings back the American patriotic theme and The Constitution the basis for this country's foundations.The use of background lighting helps place this film in its timeframe.

It brings back the American values, and strives on the World War II bonding of the American people to defeat its enemy's. In today's high society we all have lost site of the principals and foundations that this country was built on. We've gotten comfortable with our way of life, without having to defend our country.

Screaming with patriotism, this film's timing after September 11 is uncanny.Peter Appleton played by Jim Carrey is a young B movie screenwriter.  In the middle of negations to screen write for the A list movies, Appleton is black listed for so called communist activities while in school.  Distraught after losing his job and girlfriend, he drinks himself into a stopper.  He takes a drive up the California coast during a rainstorm and has an accident which causes him to drive off a bridge, and hit his head on a rock.  This causes a bout of amnesia.  He washes up on the shore of a small town of Lawson where Stan Keller (James Whitmore) a pawn shop owner finds him and brings him back to town.The town of Lawson, California is in mourning after losing 62 of its fine young men in World War II.  The town folk confuse Carrey for one of their missing in action war heroes Luke Tremble.  His resemblance to Tremble is so realistic; Luke's father Harry Tremble (Martin Landau) believes whole heartily that is son has returned. Luke and Harry decide to rebuild the movie house known as The Majestic.  Hoping to bring life back to a town that has been mourning for 9 ¬Ω years.Frank Darabont is the director of The Majestic.  He has been twice nominated for an academy award in the category for Best Adapted Screen Play for his work on The Shawshank Redemption (1994) and The Green Mile (1999).  The Majestic is similar to his other films, where Darabont tries to portray what is important in life.  In this time post 9/11, Darabont brings back the American patriotic theme and The Constitution the basis for this country's foundations.The use of background lighting helps place this film in its timeframe. The same kind of lighting used in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.   It helps add a sense of mystery to both films.The Majestic, is an entertaining, but sappy film.  It brings back the American values, and strives on the World War II bonding of the American people to defeat its enemy's.  In today's high society we all have lost site of the principals and foundations that this country was built on.  We've gotten comfortable with our way of life, without having to defend our country.  After 9/11, this films timing may for a little while renew those values and principals of country and patriotism we all have put aside for our own selfish wants.

Politics is just the backdrop. The Majestic is more about Jim Carey's character's fear of confronting a major stumbling block in his career. Being blacklisted for something he claims not to have been a part of is enough to send him into a tailspin which ultimately sees him suffering from amnesia in a small California town where he ultimately finds family, love, acceptance and meaning in his life.Is it believable that some collective psychosis exists in that town which leads everyone to believe that Jim Carey is someone he isn't? No it is not. But does this hamper the film's underlying meaning or prevent viewers from enjoying this film? Not at all. Therefore, suspension of disbelief is mandatory for viewers to have a satisfying cinematic experience. If viewers can overlook the unbelievable premise of mistaken identity and the inability of most to recognize it, or at least to publicly admit it, they will like what they see. Jim Carey gives perhaps the best performance of his career as Peter Appleton, Hollywood screenwriter. Martin Landau, owner of The Majestic movie theater and father of Carey's apparent look-a-like, also gives a terrific portrayal of a man who lost then regains a son and the ability to realize a dream to rebuild the theater he once proudly owned and operated. The supporting cast is terrific, from the theater usher to Laurie Holden, who plays Adele Stanton, the town doctor's daughter who was once engaged to the person Carey is supposed to be. She becomes a lawyer, a Constitutional defender, and Carey's inspiration to confront Congress and realize his own dream for personal happiness away from Hollywood but very much within its world. See The Majestic for a dignified Capra-inspired view of Hollywood filled with plenty of excellent performances. 8/10.

There have been many comparisons between this film and the work of legendary director Frank Capra.  That is easy to do because it is a very human story set in the 1940's and it ends with a senate hearing that is reminiscent of `Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'.  However, Capra was always very black and white when it came to good and evil, with his heroes almost saintly and his villains dastardly and despicable.  This film has more gray overtones and flawed characters.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it does take it out of the realm of being truly Capraesque.Even more importantly, this film isn't another lowbrow gross out flick by Jim Carrey.  Carrey gives a likeable performance reminiscent of `The Truman Show', with not a hint of the repugnant and boorish behavior that made him famous.  I can only pray that despite the poor box office of this film, Carrey will attempt to build on this and move in the direction that Robin Williams went, toward more substantial screenplays and real acting.  His next project, `The Children of the Dust Bowl' is a true story of a professor who set up a school for kids in the Oklahoma dust bowl in the 1930's, so he seems to have changed his script selection criteria.  That would be a blessing as he is far too talented to be wasting his life on body fluid humor.The film itself is schmaltzy and nostalgic, and it gets a little strident at the end as it tries too hard to repudiate the blacklisting and red paranoia of the 1940's and 1950's.  It is an easy story to enjoy, although it is hard for the viewer to believe that anyone in this town could possibly have thought Peter Appleton (Carrey) was really Luke Trimble.  It is as if everyone really knew the truth, but they wanted to deceive themselves.Director Frank Darabont (`The Green Mile', `The Shawshank Redemption') does a nice job on the period renderings (except not enough men in hats; hats were the rule for men during that period) with costumes and props that bring the times to life.The acting is very good.  I like Jim Carrey much better as a dramatic actor or a bittersweet comic than as a fatuous chuff.  Carrey is extremely affable as Peter, and plays the romantic parts with Laurie Holden well.  However, he is tentative in the Washington scenes, unable to summon up the resolute defiance necessary for the situation.  Martin Landau is terrific as Luke's father, bringing the character an almost delusional enthusiasm that is simultaneously charming and pathetic.  Laurie Holden also does a nice job of portraying Adele, taking a grounded character and slowly melting her emotionally as she falls in love with Luke/Peter.This is not a great film, but other than the political drum beating it is an agreeable (though improbable) feel good flick.  I rated it a 7/10.  Let's hope this portends a trend in Jim Carrey's career away from the disgusting schlock for which he has made millions.

The end result inevitably turns out more preachy and chauvinistic than the religious right they so quickly criticize.  The Majestic is a waste of perfectly good talents to accomplish what a myriad of Hollywood foot soldiers have been pounding away at for decades.  The message that anyone that opposes communism is evil.  Though I don't disagree that the 1950's HUAC, and especially the response of Hollywood's leadership, was mostly a disgrace,  I also am not so naive that I believe communists are not at war with democracy.  What I don't need is to pay to go to someone's idea of church for the ignorant.  If a movie has a message, it should be buried in the story, not pounded into your ear with a tent mallet.  A very good example of how it is done right is  Roberto Benini's La Vita Bella.  The Majestic, on the other hand, goes so far as to suggests that WWII was fought primarily to defend the first amendment.  For those who are not familiar with WWII, it was fought to stop a @#%!ing madman from taking over the world, not to defend the US constitution.  Semantics I suppose.Overt political opinions, unfortunately, are not The Majestic's only problem.  The film suffers mostly from bad directorial decisions.  Primarily, hiring Jim Carrey to play a romantic lead in a serious film.  I love Jim Carrey, but he is no Jimmy Stewart.  Carrey's performance is horribly flat and lifeless here.  He is simply not ready for a role this heavy.  And if that weren't bad enough, the director paces the film with constant dramatic pauses so large you could drive a predicable ending through them.  I also found myself second guessing all the events that were forecasted by the obviousness of the script and directing, and amazingly batted 1000 out of a dozen or so guesses.  It was that predictable.  Then there is the music.  What is it with the sound in today's movies?  Is everybody trying to win an academy award for their department?  If it's not Foley madness, then it's the sweeping big ending strings that tug at your heart... 30 seconds into the film and don't stop until end credits begin.  Speaking of academy awards, Director of Photography David Tattersol does an outstanding job.  The film is a visual delight, which only compounds the problem, because it makes you want to like this film.  The supporting cast was also outstanding.  If Carrey is intending on pursuing serious dramatic roles, I hope he payed close attention to Martin Landau.  Landau had more energy dying than Carrey had living.I read in a WGA interview that freshman writer Michael Sloane actually combined two script ideas he had to form this script, one on the House UnAmerican Activities Committees in Hollywood, and another on saving an old dilapidated theater.  Perhaps either on their own would have made a fine script, especially if he would have paid more attention to the story and less to the message.  For homework I recommend he and his high school pal Frank Darabont listen to the difference between Stevie Wonder's Living for the city, and Morton Downey Jr.'s I believe in America.

But I think that once again the academy will pass him up on this one as well.  I definitely thought that the Truman Show was the best movie of that year and Carrey's best performance to date.  It was a crossover movie for him, half funny and half serious, but this movie is completely serious. You won't be seeing any of Carrey's bathroom humor or physical gags.  This is totally serious Carrey on a subject that has barely been touched by Hollywood - that of the Blacklist.  Here we see Carrey, a B-movie screenwriter, who is blacklisted for having attended a peace club in college.  It shows the totally ridiculousness and power of the McCarthy committee.  But this is only part of the movie, or more like half of the real point.  This is combined with a look at the pain and despair of a town decimated by all its sons killed in World War II.  Carrey is mistaken for one of these missing in action sons and assumes his role since he has amnesia.  Through Carrey's time in the town he eventually gains courage and strength that he never had from a person he never knew - the very one he had been mistaken for.  Also, he brings some happiness back to the town and helps them get over their mourning.  All in all, this story combines patriotism, standing up for what's right, courage, and willingness to change.Regardless, I think this movie shows once again that Carrey is moving towards what Tom Hanks did many years ago.  Hanks started out as a small time comedian in little respected movies, but he moved onward to becoming one of the best actors of today with several great roles and academy awards under his belt as well.  I doubt Carrey will ever achieve the status of Hanks, but he definitely deserves to be given a great deal more respect now for what he has done.  Carrey isn't Ace Ventura anymore.

I think Carey is a great actor and his bashing of the Academy has cost him at least a couple of Oscar nods.( Truman Show, Man on the Moon)  Like Man on the Moon where the audience knew nothing of Andy Kaufman, Carey chose the right part for him for the wrong audience.

I much preferred Shawshank Redemption, which is one of my all-time favorite films, to The Majestic, but it's still worth seeing for some nice little moments here and there.

Forget what was going on behind the scenes; remember what the movies used to be. Remember when the stars were gods and goddesses, fifty cents could go a long way, and movie theaters were palaces? Remember when the movies were more than distractions, but magical? This kind of wonder isn't re-incarnated in Frank Darabont's latest film The Majestic, but it's nice to come across a movie that remembers what film really used to be about.Jim Carrey is Peter Appleton, a screenwriter living at the beginning of the end of Hollywood's magic era. He has a comfortable life, and he believes he is on the verge of moving from writing B pictures to the A list. Unfortunately for him, someone has named him as a communist and he is placed on the infamous Hollywood blacklist. His girlfriend dumps him and his production is shut down, leaving him with little. He decides to go for a drive and clear his mind, which is hard to do when one is drunk. Fate rears it's ugly head when he loses control of his car and falls off of a high bridge into a river. He washes up on the beach near a small town without any memory. He is taken up to the town, who is very hospitable to him. To them he seems awfully familiar. Harry Trimble (Martin Landau) knows why he believes that Peter is his long lost son Luke. The town tries to give him back his memory, constantly reminding of his life before he left for the war. Now, as Hollywood agents search for their supposed communist spy, he is trying to remember who he is.As Peter starts to accept the fact that he is most likely Luke Trimble, he leads a quest to get the Majestic (the old movie theater he lives above) back into it's former glory. It is in these re-vitalization scenes, and all the scenes inside the Majestic, that homage is paid to the Hollywood of everyone's dreams. When the Majestic is lit up, it becomes a Taj Mahal of wonder and amazement. In the outside world, Hollywood may be full of dishonest vultures looking for their next victim. But inside the Majestic, it is only movies; anything that meant anything was up on the screen until the final fadeout.The Majestic is a simple, straightforward soap opera that is saved by the good graces of Jim Carrey. Carrey is one of the most under appreciated actors in the business today, mostly because of some of the movies he's been in. It's hard for a lot of people to accept Carrey as more than a goofball that relies on poor slapstick to get him through, but Carrey has broken out of that mold. I was pleasantly surprised with his performance in The Truman Show, but he really impressed me with Man on the Moon. Now he takes another role into his own hands. Even when the film is at it's most fluffy, Carrey keeps it grounded in reality. Take Peter's trial in front of the House of Un-American Activities (those guys that started the blacklist). The script (sloppily constructed by Michael Sloane) wants it to be an melodramatic showstopper, but Carrey knows better than that. He makes the scene believable and remembers he's talking to people and that he's not the only actor in the scene. A lot of actors have trouble learning how to do that these days. Martin Landau also gives a wonderful performance worthy of recognition as the father who's desperate to bring his son back to life.The film is far from without fault. Director Frank Darabont has developed a complex that makes him feel the need to make movies no less than two and a half hours long, and to be honest, too much of The Majestic is dead air. When Carrey cries out Don't tell me that's what Luke would have done, as if I haven't heard that enough today! I could sympathize with him completely. We're trying to believe in a character who doesn't exist, and we're given an incredible amount of chatter about the kind of person Luke Trimble was. Each discovery about Luke is brought about like a new revelation (and presented with some more speechifying), but there were too many times when I was just thinking who cares? Long movies don't always equal excellence.The Majestic is a recommendable film that can remember how fun pictures used to be, but is too wrapped up in it's own little details to pass any of that energy onto the audience. Carrey redeems the film from the scrap pile and makes it into a presentable piece. The acting is a diamond in the rough that will not get the attention it deserves due to the rest of the mush surrounding it. The protagonist of The Majestic is constantly fighting for originality in his work, but the film itself can be just as tiresome as the ideas pitched at him. Expect a nice but forgettable journey that's heart lies in the performances of Carrey and Landau. "},{"Title":"All I have to say is...

The Majestic is probably considered a film of sappy and boringness, and the critic and the golden globe did not like it. My opinion is, you can never see the real thing until you are open enough to accept it. People definitely didn't accept the real Jim Carrey, as they were all expecting him to SUCK in this film. Why? Simply because he is labeled as a comic actor. But why can't they just let the actors act and really see what is already there? The casts in this film were great, and Jim Carrey was definitely not phony. The scrip is cool, maybe a few more interesting incidents will make more people want to see it. When there is nothing left but the truth, I guess things gets interesting really but boring to the ignorant ones.I will recommend this film to anyone who is willing to see something worldly and far away from the high-tech world. And one more thing, to all of you who made horrible comments on Jim Carrey, remember this everyone works hard to be on the top, and being on the top is pressured greatly.

His goal is to one day write for the big major theatres, however in the era of McCarthyism, Peter Appleton (Jim Carrey) is branded a communist cause while in college he attended a rally to court a young woman.  Peter must testify and name 'names' if he wants to save his skin.  Shortly after this news spreads, Peter looses his girlfriend, his job, and in a drunken stupor ends up driving off a bridge, falling into a swollen river, knocked unconscious, and ends up washed up on a beach with amnesia.Peter is found by a local fisherman who brings him to his small town remarking that he looks familiar.  By this point in the film I was already groaning at the ridiculous chances of fate and luck that enough was enough, but the film continues with more unbelievable surprises.  Once Peter walks into town a resident becomes convinced that it is his long lost son who went missing in the war.  The town is in awe that 'Luke' has returned home even though he doesn't know who he is, and his father who just HAPPENS to own a movie theatre wants to re-open it now that Luke is back.The films fault isn't the acting, but the ridiculous overuse of surprise and co-incidence that makes things just too annoying, and mostly unbelievable to the viewer.  You find that most of them don't even seem realistic, from Peter's survival in the accident, a town that has lost several residents to the war, to the fact that the McCarthy era was much more meaner than portrayed in this film, and that people just didn't 'walk' away from it so easily.The film also tries for ridiculous sentimentality but none of the charm. The Majestic theatre is a TOTAL rip off of the theatre in Cinema Paradiso which is a PHENOMENAL movie.  I couldn't help but feel how much this movie was trying to imitate its magic but failing misserably.  The final court-room scene is also overly dramatized and very unrealistic (he just walks out... I don't think so..).Carrey isn't the fault in this film, he is good if not ok, it is the fact that they try to for a political heart-tugging social message which gets lost in a sea of overly sacchrined sugar patriotism.  It was very fake.Unrealistic, long, tedious, boring, not believable.  I seemed that the only movie I liked was the little black and white swashbuckling B-movie that Peter wrote that was shown in the film.

In fact, I watched it again today just hours before I viewed The Majestic. I didn't plan it to be that way, but it ended up that I could compare the two Darabont films in a way. I also noticed several people in The Majestic who were from The Shawshank Redemption.Anyway, I wanted to see the Majestic because I like the director. Here's what I thought. The movie was a good, entertaining story with a happy ending. I surrender that it was a little cheesy at times, but I think that was put there. The movie was set in the 50's, and I think Darabont wanted to make it seem appropriate for the time, and 50's entertainment is cheesy.I also thought that the name of the movie is a poor choice. The movie wasn't really about the theater. Jim Carrey showed that he can act. Call me crazy, but I don't really like Carrey as a comedian. I like him as an actor who shows talent in films like this.I wish that more people could like a movie without thinking that they need to be entertained every moment of the film. Character development can be boring. So can profound concepts. This movie is aimed at a more sophisticated audience. Everyone has his or her own opinion, and that's fine. My opinion is that if you didn't like this movie, perhaps (not automatically) it is because you just didn't get it. Ponder it a little more.Some thought provoking concepts I pondered during and after the film are as follows Living in someone else's shadow, living up to expectations, conformity, standing up for what is noble, what a hero is, whether or not society as a whole has progressed since the Salem witch trials if we are still hunting for them in the 1950's, whether or not we have progressed since then. Freedom of speech, life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness. This may sound corny, but to me it is not.This movie had a purpose, and it wasn't to keep one entertained for a mere 2 1/2 hours. It was to leave an impression. At least that's what I took from it. Think about it.The courtroom scene was my favorite, it literally gave me chills.

Not just because I am a fan of Frank Darabont's previous films The Green Mile and The Shawshank Redemption, but also because it was the first film in which I was an extra. I played one of the actors in convict uniforms in the studio scene at the beginning of the film. Unfortunately I am not visible in the scene (although all 4 of the other convicts I worked with ARE). The other two scenes we filmed at the studio were cut out of the film.And that, I think, is part of the problem. This story needed more development at the beginning - it was too quick before the accident - we needed time to get to know the Jim Carrey character and appreciate who he was before everything happens. We also need more time to understand the problem he has and to let the seriousness of the issue sink in before moving on. That would help justify the movie's concluding scenes better.If anything should have been cut, it's the very very slow moving middle of the film. This film makes The Straight Story look like Gone in 60 Seconds  - that's how terribly slow it is. I even got up to use the bathroom at one point - something I NEVER do in movies.The acting is passable but I expected more. While we were filming, Mr. Darabont would insist on many, many takes - as many as 25 for the outdoor studio scene. Jim Carrey said that this method of filming gives you nuances in performances that you don't get from just one take. I disagree. I think when you have that many takes, you get actors that are not willing to commit to give it their all because they know there will be another 20 takes to come (or because there have just been a previous 20 takes earlier and they are tired). And this shows clearly in the acting here.I don't know whether to fault the script, the direction, or the acting-- I think it's a combination of all three.

A film with Jim Carrey that's supposed to have emotional content? But after seeing his performance in Eternal Sunshine I rented The Majestic and was positively surprised.First I would like to remark on the setting of this film, it's placed in 1950's America during the years of Communist Witchhunt's of which the lead, played by Carrey becomes a victim. The film makes a real effort to create this atmosphere and I have to say it pulls it of very nicely, creating believable space for Carrey to act out his role's frustration.After the summons to appear before the committee Carey starts drinking heavily and get's into a car-crash which gives him amnesia. A river washes him to a small town where he is believed to be a prodigal son. The amnesia and mistaken identity aren't new, especially in the literary world, but the given is used in a very fresh and eloquent way, I registered the fact, but was never annoyed by it.The village of Lawson is portrayed in such a way that it really seems to be a living, breathing town with it's little rarities and interpersonal currents. In many ways I was surprised by the quality of acting in the villagers that made it all so 'real'.If I give it all this praise, then why the seven. A fair question that's easy enough to answer. Although it's easy to see how this movie can be turned into a moralizing story about Communist Hunt's, the right of Free Speech and 'Our Boy's Fighting For Democracy' my biggest surprise was that half way in the movie, it still hadn't moved into this morale. Sure it leaned (sometimes heavily) on these themes, but always believable and relevant (the fallen sons are an integral part to create the setting of the town and 'Luke's' return)But it seems that with half an hour to go the director remembered his mission and sets out to make 'a great American movie about Democracy' but this film isn't the vehicle to that end. It suffers a bit of over-romanticizing in the end, making believability (the strength of it in the beginning) an issue. It has to be said that Paul's speech to the commission is very neatly nuanced, which I really liked and redeemed the film in my eyes.

The price that those who died or were injured in the war was made clear, however, the hero of the story pays no price - he continues with his career, and only walks away by his own choice.

The story is so forced and difficult to believe that you start to get tired at the first 50 minutes. Carrey's acting is pretty normal, and i saw comedy signs in some scenes that are difficult to not see after you have Carrey's stile in your mind. (I almost laugh when Carrey is drinking water nervous, or when he falls after being punched). Darabont acting style is remarkable, and makes you feel some charm and beauty in the story, places and people, but it is not a Stephen King story, so Darabont did the best that could have done for this script, (he could've rejected to do this film too).About the story The story is held in 1951, the golden age of Hollywood; and where a writer, Peter Appleton (Carrey) work for an important studio with a good a position, his girlfriend is a movie star and his life is well, until he is accused as communist. All his life throws apart in that moment, depressed he crashed his car and falls to a river, unconscious he appears in a small Town called Lawson, where his face is familiar to all, but in the accident he suffered amnesia, so he can't remember anything of his past; in this town, a movie theater called The Majestic exists and so the movie take this as its name.About the cast Carrey's acting is pretty normal, and didn't convinced me, Laurie Holden (Adele Stanton) acting is nothing remarkable, Martin Landau as Harry is great! putting a lot of soul in this character!; David Odgen (Doc Stanton) is the character that i liked most!,the acting is perfectly adjusted to the character; Jeffrey DeMunnn (Ernie Cole) still a little exaggerated, does a good acting too.

The people of a small town take him in and he is identified by Harry Trimble as his son Luke, thought dead in the war. Harry takes in his son and returns him to their home &#150; a broken down cinema called The Majestic, where they start to renovate for reopening. Meanwhile, back in Hollywood, a manhunt is launched to find Peter, labelling him a communist on the run.I ignored the bad reviews and poor word of mouth about this film and decided to pick it up when it came onto television recently. It is not long into it that the collapse happens, although in fairness it is not like the early part offered much in the way of potential or inspiration. The small town setting, the lost memory narrative device, the warm sentiment, the homely characters and so on and so forth, it all smacks of easy clich√©. I kept waiting for the beauty within the story or something insightful to occur but moment after sickly sweet moment dragged by but it never came. It didn't help me that the film is set within the world of the communist blacklisting &#150; a period where sentimentality and wholesome goodness are totally out of place against the reality of that period.The cast are mostly sucked down by the material. Carrey does the best he can and indeed turns in a commendable performance against the odds; such a shame that he doesn't have the material to work with. The support cast features loads of familiar faces but nobody to really step up and be memorable. Landau, Holbrook, Rifkin, Stiers, Campbell and others all provide solid support but few are able to make the film theirs despite it pretty much being there for the taking. Darabont's direction is typically classy and he frames a good shot but he is responsible for letting the thing regularly slide away into easy sentiment.Overall then a fairly dull and uninspiring film. I waited for it to do more than it did but it never seemed to aspire beyond mediocre while the warm, fuzzy sentiment contrasts very starkly with the reality of the blacklisting period &#150; the film does nothing but a disservice to the period.

The main problem with this one is that it insists on a Hollywood-style bookending, complete with a voice over narration to establish the character in the first person (which is then dropped for the rest of the movie), and a faux-Capra-esque set speech at the end which is inexplicably cheered by the masses attending the House Unamerican Activities Committee hearing, not even to mention by the denizens of the idealized yet somehow oddly liberal small California town in which the middle part of the picture takes place.The real fatal flaw of the film, on top of the anti-McCarthyism preachiness, is that unlike Martin Guerre, it shows its hand from the the beginning. We, the audience, know that Peter is a fake and is not really returned-from-the-dead war hero Luke (no spoilers here, since the film gives it all away). So the creepiness and the mystery of the original schtick are all lost. And the movie really overdoes it with presenting the dead Luke as this great guy, without any baggage, and without any nuance. As such the dead Luke becomes a cartoon character, echoing the inexplicable character transformation of Peter in the end when he has his confrontation with HUAC over alleged past associations with known communists.It's a strange thing to say, but this movie could have been saved in the editing room without changing the script (again, ironic, since the screenwriter's willingness, or lack thereof, to change his script in order to get along is the bookend device of the movie). Had the director simply chosen to take the whole prologue, and just start the movie with Luke waking up mysteriously in the town of Lawson, (and then, if you must, have him recover his memory later and show the prologue instead as a flashback), it would have made a more convincing movie.Jim Carrey's ability to carry a dramatic role has always been underrated, and he does what he can with the material here, and nearly pulls it off. But it's just too fluffy a script for such a heavy subject -- the sacrifices of making war, and the principles to be defended by war -- no matter what the talents of the actor are.The whole middle part of the story about re-opening the Majestic theater, as a metaphor for renewal following a great loss, also was a bit of a missed opportunity. I appreciate how the filmmaker subtly chose two movies from 1951 that represent opposite ends of the reaction to the Hollywood witch hunt -- Streetcar Named Desire which was an outstanding film that Director Elia Kazan could only make because he was willing to name names, and The Day the Earth Stood Still which was scathing criticism of the paranoia of the era framed as a Science Fiction parable. But at the same time the idea of the movies as a way of living, vicariously, issues which we're not able to deal with directly because they're too painful or raw, is left undeveloped.I will note the especially good performance by Martin Landau as the long-lost-Luke's father, and a subtle performance by David Ogden Stiers as the town doctor and Luke's putative father-in-law. In the former, you see the pain of having lost an only son, and it's a very nuanced performance that shows how the desperate grief could lead one to a case of mistaken identity. In the latter, Stiers shows skepticism appropriate to the oddness situation that the rest of the townsfolk choose to ignore, but without recrimination when Peter is shown to be a fraud. And finally, the late great James Whitmore is quite good as the elderly resident who finds Luke.

The Majestic tried too hard to keep the audience's attention. The Majestic tried to hard to give us a fictional town where realism was taken from the same page as Pleasantville. The Majestic attempted to give Jim Carrey the opportunity to win an Oscar, but as we learn from Jack Nicholson, one sometimes cannot just calm the face to fully embrace a dramatic role. My point is that The Majestic tried too hard, thus forcing the film to transform from a sentimental piece of nostalgia, to just sheer rubbish. While Darabont tried to capture the spirit of 1950s Hollywood in this film, what in fact occurred was simple one dimensional characters that we cared nothing for, events that took place that seemed misplaced from reality, and emotions that escaped honesty forcing us to sit through two plus hours of pure, 100% uncut, Darabont drivel.As I write this review, I find myself looking at what I thought this film was going to center around to suddenly realizing what Darabont actually gave me. To be utterly frank, this is not a film about a theater. Sure, one would assume from both the poster as well as the trailer that it may be about a man suffering from amnesia goes to a small town to rejuvenate an independent theater. As a man who dreams of similar ideas (sans the amnesia), I was ready to enjoy this feature. I was even willing to give Carrey a chance because he had proved to me over time that he could handle a meatier roll. Alas, when the final credits finally did run for this film, I did not see The Majestic as the film that was promised to me. I was expecting an American version of Cinema Paradiso, but instead found myself with more recycled Hollywood mumbo-jumbo that I could wave a stick at. The story was profoundly old, with Carrey doing nothing to re-establish his character. As I look back at his performance, he didn't grab anything by the horns, he didn't push his character to the limit, what he attempted to do was gain audience support by being less comic/zany and more human, but for me you could see right though his performance. In a year worth of decent performers making their mark in Hollywood, Carrey's performance of Peter Appleton was about as transparent as a ghost and will not remain relevant through the test of time.As I sit here and nitpick this film, I realize that The Majestic was not the best that Darabont has to offer. I would argue that The Shawshank Redemption was a pure moment of cinematic intelligence, and that perhaps when Darabont joins forces with Stephen King, the work is pure film magic, but when it comes to creating other work, it just seems to fall into the pan of lest resistance. My major issue with this film was the surfacing of smaller issues like Carrey's nonchalant performance, the ridiculous nature of the town of Lawson (and the clich√© characters that seemed to inhabit the streets), and the over-played ending speech which seemed like a cut-and-paste of nearly ever other courtroom drama ever produced. It just felt uncreative from beginning to end. There were hardly any surprises or moments that had you gripping your seat with anticipation. Darabont played it safe, but the final result ended up being a jumbled mess of already used clich√©s. I wish I could list them all for you, but as a man who has seen his fair share of movies, I could count the beats with my eyes closed in this film. I knew when he was going to crash, I knew there was going to be a love interest, I knew Carrey would be faced with emotion, and I knew that eventually he would have to defend himself to everyone that we found our eyes surrounding. I knew these events were going to happen, and I am sure that anyone that has seen more than two films in their lifetime would see the same. Creativity, imagination, and energy are three core elements needed to make a film go from average to cult-remembering &#133; but The Majestic had none of these traits, so it falls into the wayside of being found in a dollar bin within the year.As I read my lines for this review, a name seems to resonate deeply within these words that utterly describe why this feature failed. The acting was laughable and the story was as generic as Grade-A cheese, and while others may blame Carrey or the writer for such errors, this critic blames Frank Darabont. I see that he was trying to redefine an era of cinema, but why, as a man who loves movies from the 1940s, is this film so terrible to view? I do not believe that Darabont was able to capture the raw nature of the period. I don't believe that Mayberry is on every corner and that every film made in the 50s represented this fake life. He over dramatized the smaller events while completely missing his mark on the bigger moments. This film could have benefited from a small war scene, or possibly from a visitation from Luke himself near the end. I just needed something to spark my interest more than what was presented here. I felt cheated from this film because it gave up midway through and did not push the limits of film-making.

As he's driving on a very fake-looking bridge, he crashes and loses his memory. He winds up on a beach and is taken to a small, idyllic town, which lost many people to the war. It turns out that people think that he's Luke Trimble, a war hero, and Harry Trimble's (Martin Landau) son.I didn't believe for a minute that Peter was actually Luke and Harry's son. I think that there was supposed to be some sort of mystery of whether Peter was actually Luke or anyone, but you could probably guess. When Peter didn't know, I thought that he didn't really have chemistry with Harry. Most of the small-town sets were just fa√ßades, just like in westerns. When I took a studio tour of Universal Studios last summer, I noticed how similar everything was. I think we shouldn't have known whether Peter was Luke or if Luke was Peter, etc.Another thing that seemed fake was Adele's (Laurie Holden) hiccups that she got whenever she was nervous. They didn't really need to be there, because it's 150-minute runtime is hard enough to sit through, and they didn't really add any humor.The Majestic is the name of the movie theater in the town where Harry lives, and now that they think that Luke is back, they decide to open it. That's about the worse reason for naming a movie (besides Swimfan, of course). In fact, if that entire worthless subplot was taken out, the runtime could have been chopped by 45 minutes or so.Carrey proves that he's better at drama than at slapstick comedy yet again. After his terrific acting role in The Truman Show, he's one of the better points of The Majestic. Why he continues to do idiotic comedy, I don't know, when he could be doing much better in drama. Landau was also quite good, although I would have liked his role to be bigger. Another person's role that was small that I wanted larger was Amanda Detmer's role as Sandra, Peter's girlfriend. She's a good actress, and she should be better known. There was something about Laurie Holden. She just didn't do anything for me.As I look on my notes, I see I wrote `authentic if fakey music', which contradicts itself. I think I meant that the music seemed real for the time-period, but it seemed made just for that period and this movie. Understand what I mean? Well, neither do I. And, like all time-piece dramas, there has to be a climactic courtroom scene which concludes with the main character giving a monologue on where America went wrong, etc.It had some good drama, but it just wasn't enough for me. They could have reworked it and released it later to make it better, which they could do a lot of.My rating 6/10Rated PG for language and mild thematic elements.

Tom Hanks did the same thing and started immediately having Oscars. I had my doubts with Jim Carrey, though. After all, Williams and Hanks never did screwball comedies like Ace Ventura Pet detective and Liar, liar.But The Truman show and Man on the moon proofed that Carrey wasn't just a rubber-face after all, he was a highly gifted performer and very capable to play dramatic roles too. The Majestic continues his career outside the comedy. Unfortunately it's not as good as The Truman show and Man on the moon was.Biggest problem of this film is that it's over-sentimental and frustratingly sugary - way, way too corny. It's like someone's shouting at your ear and ordering Now this is a touching moment! Now it's time to shed tears! and you still don't feel a thing.I'm not blaming Carrey for this because he makes a very successful and stylish performance as Peter Appleton. It's just that there's only one Frank Capra and he died eleven years ago and no matter how good The Shawshank redemption and The Green mile was, Frank Darabont will never fill his shoes.Like I said The Majestic was still rather good and entertaining flick and Jimmy made a fine work in it. Personally I think Carrey may still get his Oscar. Not for many, many years but maybe someday when the academy has totally forgotten he ever was in Dumb and dumber.

It tells a very complex story that is fascinating from beginning to end, however unlikely it is in reality. Obviously, it's not likely that a man is going to stumble into a small town after an accident and be mistaken for someone else by that town's Mayor and all of its citizen's including the man's former fianc√©e and even his FATHER. No matter how vaguely you look at him, Peter Appleton does not look like Luke Trimble and he most certainly does not talk like Matt Damon.However, once you suspend disbelief enough to accept that this has happened, you get a great story about a man trying to figure things out, as he put it. Jim Carrey delivers a stunningly convincing performance as Peter Appleton, the struggling screenwriter whose career is threatened because he is suspected to be a communist at the height of the Red Scare. Needless to say, we grow to like Appleton enormously over the course of the movie even though he doesn't even know who he is and for a lot of the time we're not even really sure either. When we see that his career threatened to be destroyed by these groundless suspicions (not to mention when we see a lot of men that we hate from the moment we see them &#150; one of which keeps a fly swatter in his office within easy reach on his desk. How's THAT for symbolism?), it becomes clear that the movie has a lot to say about how the government handles things like this. But more important than that, the movie says a lot about the public, particularly the moviegoing public (yeah, that's you). The movie portrays the public as a group of people who are ready and willing to follow along with whatever they hear in the newspapers and condemn the movies written by a man who is suspected by the government to be a communist. Here's a completely innocent man whose life was about to be ruined because of the gullibility of the American public. I can't say I was entirely thrilled with a lot of the small details in the movie, such as the fact that Appleton was a screenwriter but was a bad speller (people who write for a living did not get to that position by being bad spellers &#150; professional writers who can't spell do not exist) or the fact that after the car crash the director felt the need to have Appleton smack his head on the cement pillar (was falling off the bridge and landing in the river upside down not enough?) or even the fact that he walked into the town of Lawson and looked `familiar' to everyone he saw. Could NO one place him? Oh, and remember what happened after the crash? Appleton washed up on the beach along with his CAR. What the hell?! Was it made of styrofoam? Besides that, the landscaping in the movie could use a little work. There was hardly a single backdrop in the entire film that didn't look fake, but the story is so good that it vastly overshadows things like this.Jim Carrey once again proves himself as an extremely capable actor, and that he is not just some slapstick comedian goofball. His reactions are perfect as people begin to realize who they think he is. This is a nearly perfect performance, it keeps you entertained from beginning to end, and never gives away too much to allow you to predict the ending. The only problem is that when the end does arrive it seems to be sort of a copout, a little TOO much of a happy ending, but not all that improbable either, especially when compared to the rest of the situations in the movie. The movie has a lot to say about the government and about America and about war (it looks WAY down on war) and leaves us feeling that no one in the movie was cheated even though Appleton's career was unfairly put into danger, a whole town was brought to their feet by someone who wasn't who they thought he was, and Luke Trimble was just as dead as the town of Lawson had been thinking that he was for 9 ¬Ω years. The trial before the House Un-American Activities Committee was one of the best climactic scenes I've seen in a movie in years. Jim Carrey's performance is at it's peak here as he clearly shows that Appleton is trying to decide if he should go ahead and take the risk of standing up to the committee, and he does it so well that it makes you want to stand up and cheer for him. I'm an aspiring director, and this is exactly the kind of movie that I want to make.

But I could tell that, if he slipped up, he would make a picture like The Majestic. It's like 1000 megatons of Capra-corn mixed with some half-assed politicizing. The film exists in two realms at the beginning and end of the film, the main character (Peter, played by Jim Carrey) is a Hollywood screenwriter. With only one screenplay under his belt, the House of Un-American Activities calls him in for trial, based on a meeting he attended when he was in college. He didn't even know the Bread Instead of Bullets Club was involved in Communist activities; he just went there to impress a girl. Angry at his misfortune, Peter goes for a drive and gets in an accident. He loses his memory and ends up in the small town of Laughton, California. This is the second realm of the movie, the small town Americana from Frank Capra's films. Laughton lost a large number of its younger male citizens to WWII, and Peter is mistaken for one of them who was lost in action, Luke. Luke's father (Martin Landau) is convinced from the outright that this is his son, and the rest of the town, praying for this kind of miracle, is able to easily convince itself that this amnesiac is their lost hero. The material in this part of the film is actually quite good, and could be the stuff to make a much better film. There's a lot of pathos that exists in the town of Laughton. The film could have been about the pain of loss and the worse pain of denial. The screenwriter and Darabont, though, want little more than to tug at our heart-strings. It tries so hard to be a weepy (Landau's scenes are pretty awful to watch), but it doesn't much succeed. Most of the stuff in Laughton is pretty good, and, like I said, it's good material. The real problem with the film is that the filmmakers are not able to connect those parts to the HUAC stuff. The Americana of Laughton is supposed to convince Peter that what HUAC is doing is wrong and unconstitutional (he reads aloud the First Amendment when he is called to testify). The whole time I was thinking, yeah, hindsight is 20/20. This is wishful thinking from the future. None of this works well. Jim Carrey's performance is just bad. He can not do dramatic roles, and he needs to learn this immediately if he wants to stay in the movies. The only performance that's really worth pointing out comes from Bob Balaban as one of the presiding senators in HUAC. He had two great performances last year, here and in Gosford Park. 5/10.

Both Carrey and Holden must bear some of the responsibility for the breakdown of the film at this point. Their acting lacks sublety and depth and they play their emotions far too close to the surface with the end result being that the emotions seem shallow and the performances contrived. Perhaps knowing this, the director has tried to make the photography and annoyingly ever-present schmaltzy music tell the audience what we are expected to feel.  Cue tears,  Cue laughter.  You get the drift.With the emphasis in plot now shifting to The Majestic theatre itself the film almost saves itself.  But no, whoever was driving this production didn't realise what a gem they might have had and instead decides to spend the last third of the film cramming in as many cliched Hollywood endings as time and budget would allow.  Theres' not just one cliche ending, there are about five!!  If this was a parody it would be a winner, but unfortunately the film-makers were deadly serious.  By the time Carrey has gone from blubbering tears, to eye-popping joy before ripping off Jimmy Stewart's performance in Mr Smith Goes to Washington, myself and the rest of the poor tortured audience had had enough.  I could barely contain my laughter as we were then subjected to marching band fanfares, cheering crowds and then the gooiest of saccharine camera pans across the happy family photo album. Blerrch!  Most audience members had the good sense to charge out and head straight for the bathroom before having to read a list of those responsibile.

You might find yourself wondering about your shopping, musing on whether you've got enough dried food for the dog. And that's when the film is at its most frantic! The Majestic is a try hard bore masquerading as serious cinema; small time America on a wholesome red carpet.Jim Carrey in spite of being most known for his slapstick comedy routines in The Ace Ventura films has  slipped predominantly towards dramatic rolls. He can be good at them. The sometimes surreal films Cable Guy, The Truman Show and Man On The Moon were dramas with a strange twist, as befits an actor who's always been a little off key at his best. Comedy is after all the drama of the ridiculous.The Majestic is anything but comedic however with Carrey playing it dead straight  in what's unfortunately an out dated, Capraesque, I love small town America, homily. Carrey plays Peter who's written a third rate film in early 1950's America. He gets accused of being a communist, takes a knock on the head and wakes up with amnesia in Lawson, a village imbued with old timers who lost a lot of sons in WW2. One of the old men, Harry Trimble (Martin Landau), claims Peter is his long lost son Luke, who was lost in action for nearly ten years ago. There's a strong physical resemblance.Callow Hollywood man Peter/Luke is lovingly adopted by the good citizens of Lawson and helps reopen The Majestic, the local theatre, which was run by Harry years before. This gives the citizens the opportunity to laud the character of American cinema. Luke/Peter also inherits Luke's old girlfriend Adele (Laurie Holden).In tried (tired) and true Frank Capra fashion the Feds are closing in and of course the amnesia will eventually lift. The last act of the film has Peter defending the rights of good Americans to have freedom of speech.What defeats The Majestic is its pace, and I'd imagine that a slow development of the plot was deliberately chosen by director Frank Darabont (The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile). The Majestic certainly has the feel of countless 1950's homilies to the American way which must have been the intention.But we've moved on surely from this sort of stuff, even if some Americans, feeling under threat in recent times, might find this subject matter comforting.

The great thing about King is that he loves small town 1950s America, but he always includes touches of realism in his movies. The Majestic seems to be a poor man's version of Shawshank, of small town life.  Both explore a mainly white community in the post-war years, but the Shawshank wasn't corny, shamelessly nostalgic, or rah-rah American like the Majestic is.The characters are cut-out cliches and I kept waiting and hoping for a character with substance to come along.

It starts well with some nice directing and clever work as our hero gets drunk and leaves Hollywood with the threat of a court subpoena over his head to appear before the McCarthy hearings.And then it moves to a small town where our hero - now an amnesiac - is feted as the long-lost son of the community, home from the war nine years after it ended.During this time we as an audience are kept guessing. Is he really the son of the local cinema owner? Is it an elaborate hoax? Or is it just a wild coincidence.And then towards the end of the film we are told the truth. And then, presumably as a cheap and dumbed-down reaction to the Bush administration's war on terror and homeland security clampdown, our hero suddenly appears before the hearing and gives one of the most awful, banal, pathetic, manipulative, cringe-making, immature, naive, trite, pandering, oleaginous, saccharin, childish and vomit-inducing feel-good speeches of all time defending America's right to free speech and apple pie and all that.An utter cop out at which point I switched off and went to bed.

I don't think he's got the talent for this sort of thing, but he's smart enough to know what it is and seek out these projects.

However, I was deeply disappointed to find out that this movie is really nothing more than just an extremely good try to put as many cliche s as one can in a movie. And that with the man who made masterpieces of originality like The Cable Guy or Truman Show. Throughout the movie I got more and more irritated by the eversmiling faces of the townspeople and the fact that I could not only tell what would happen next, but also exactly how, with what camera-angle and which background. Except for counting cliche s, I have spend the entire duration of the movie waiting for the typical Jim Carrey joke that would reveal something that would change the whole movie, showing the viewer that it was not meant as a serious attempt to a bad movie. there were even times when I wondered whether I was watching a serious movie, or a comical. I don¬¥t know what came into everyone in Hollywood when they let this script pass or into Carrey when he accepted this part.

Sad thing really, cause it had POTENTial with a capital potent.  Could be great, but instead it's a movie that confuses itself.  Two worlds brought together in a very uninspired and overlapping way that wreaks of last minute fidgety production.  Mr Carrey plays a writer that gets into an accident, loses his memory, and is picked up by a town for someone he's not.  But he fails to realize this until later.  I ruin nothing by saying this, and that is one of the problems.  The predictable and shallow story leaves you waiting and waiting for something monumental - at least a trendy twist or the death of some body.  After Carrey enters this new life, there is a good 45 minutes before there is a glimpse of what is going on his real commie life.  Oooookay, so he's not dreaming, and it just get's more confused from there.  The end just trails on whipping over every cliche in the book from the risky, but right decision, to that damn kiss.  Nothing is original in this movie - instead we wait and wait, sitting through Jimmy's gazes and (non)development which shoves this motion picture off the cliff of lameness and into nothing.

However, Peter Appleton (played by Jim Carrey in 'serious mode') soon drives his car off a bridge and ends up with a severe case of amnesia in a town called Lawson. Then the horror begins...Everybody in Lawson has lost a son or two in the Second World War, but that surely doesn't keep them from being dreadfully nice to one another. The same goes for Harry Trimble, played by Martin 'Big Fish Mouth' Landau. Peter unfortunately happens to be an exact double of Trimble's lost boy Luke and is mistaken for him. The whole of Lawson is so grateful for the miracle of Luke's return that they can't stop smiling and hugging and following Peter all over the place. Even when he is having a private conversation with Luke's old girlfriend Adele, they are sneaking up on them from behind. Not in an evil way, of course. It's just that they are so endearingly curious and deeply touched by their love renewed. Ah! Instead of inviting us to care for the characters, director Frank Darabont decided to command us to care by forcing every single emotion down our throats. When I see the old Trimble cry pathetically over a photograph of his lost son, I don't like him for it. I hate him for it. And that greasy tell-tale score by Mark Isham doesn't help much, to say the least.There is even a black man in this movie, whose only wish is for a pocket watch, so that he can always start working on time. Now isn't that moving? My goodness, he might as well be shouting 'Like me! Like me!' at the camera to win our sympathy.But wait. It gets worse. This movie even tries to make a political statement against McCarthyism by means of a classic courtroom showdown. You know, with the judge repeating 'Silence!' and 'You are out of order!', while Carrey delivers a monologue packed with such profound emotion and justice it nearly made me puke. Yes, it was that strong, ladies and gentlemen. The moment when he flashes that medal of honor at the stupefied judge must be seen to be believed. A Monsterpiece!

In screenwriting they teach you that if you're not hooked by a script after the first ten pages or so, you never will be, and that's what happens with The Majestic for me.I'm sure Darabont was trying to make an old-fashioned movie in the vein of Capra that moved at its own pace, but he somehow forgot about the story (something he ironically keeps saying is dead in Hollywood).

Unfortunately the character he is playing has so little character that it is impossible to say. Due to the script, not Carrey. When an actor gives his all there is a very thin line between brilliance and embarrassing failure. Jim Carrey never stops crossing back and forth over that line in this movie.The script does not explore its themes or the feelings they provoke at all, it is unbearably sentimental and the characters have no personality. I started getting a little interested, when the main character arrived in Lawson and you didn't know whether he was faking amnesia or not - but then that question was answered in a very obvious way and I gave up.I am one of those idiots who cannot leave Jim Carrey as he is, but thinks he should do something else with his talent. Man on the Moon is my favorite Jim Carrey-film and I think it says a lot about the Academy that they hardly noticed his performance.But a script like this one does not fit Jim Carrey's talent. I hope he will keep looking for a genre that does him justice.

It has Jim Carrey, who has moved from being offensively irritating as Ace Ventura to being equally irritating in his good ol' boy straight roles, playing the innocent victim of a HUAC witch hunt at the height of the McCarthyite hysteria in the US. Lacking the courage of its convictions (and undoubtedly with an eye to increased box office sales) Carrey's character is shown to have been unfairly harassed because instead of being a communist he was simply a 'horny young man' following a lustful trail to a meeting at which he was unaware of the political content. Even today it seems that we can't have a hero in an American movie who is shown to have had any hint of a communist link in their past. The inhabitants of the town of Lawson where Carrey finds himself after his accident are all the sorts of wonderful people that we are supposed to believe are the real spirit of America. Supporters of the constitution one and all. Defenders of liberty and free speech. Funnily enough they seem to have been rather short on the ground during the McCarthy era and this is at the heart of the historical revisionism that I find most offensive in this movie. For me the biggest joke though (and presumably unintentional) are the scenes where Carrey as the scriptwriter has to endure meetings where his scripts are radically altered by greedy studio executives to make them more marketable. There won't be dry eye in the house says one of them after suggesting a cynically saccharine manipulation of one of the scripts. The irony of all this is that the script for this movie seems to have been written by just such a committee.

There is a certain kinetic feeling when you see a film, one way or another.  You can see a picture and walk out of it and it will stay with you for days after you leave the theater.  It's brilliance keeps you talking about it and you can't recommend it enough to those that ask your opinion about the latest film you have seen.  Then there is the opposite end of the spectrum, and that is when you know about half-way through the film that you are going to absolutely detest what is on screen.  This is the type of picture that has you checking your watch and shifting in your seat every five minutes.  Unfortunately, this has been what we have been tacitly subjected to over the last few years.  The years 2000 and 2001 have not been years Hollywood can be proud of.  It is quite disturbing that each and every year that passes, Hollywood claims it made more than the previous year.  The bucks keep rolling in which means that the public is paying for the mundane offerings that film makers are marketing for us.  It's strange though, as I said, a film will usually make you feel something one way or another.  And then there is the film The Majestic.  This is a film that made me feel... well it kept me.... okay it was just so.....it was just so..... ah hell, let's be honest, it was just so nebulous and full of the blahs.  I don't know how else to put it.  The Majestic just made me feel nothing.  Nothing at all.  I didn't enjoy the film nor was I particularly angered with it.  I wasn't enlightened by it but it tried its damndest to put me to sleep.  It is just a film that seems to prod along until the end and then it ends.  There is no big revelation, there is no big secret, there is really nothing to get excited about in any way.  I am not sure what the producers of this film were thinking when they green lighted it, but they made a mistake.This is a story about a screenwriter who is blacklisted in Hollywood and decides to take a drive and crashes into the water and turns up in a town with no memory of who he is.  Here he of course meets the fluffy old town folk that welcome him with open arms and do their best to convince him that he is some long lost dead soldier who must have developed amnesia for the last decade.  Here he meets his dad and old girlfriend and then he resurrects an old movie theater and then people find out that he is not really who they think he is and then he has to go back to Hollywood to testify and he becomes a man by telling the truth and not copping out and he makes all the fluffy townsfolk really really proud of him and then he goes back and the entire town is waiting for him and blah blah blah blah blah blah de blah de de de de blah de blah.  So what?  What does all of this mean?  What is the point of it all?  Other reviewers and critics will tell you that this film shows the golden age of movies and draw parallels with Carrey's character and the Majestic, the theater he is trying to refurnish.  I don't buy any of it.  This is a film that may as well be the 600th episode in a T.V show that has been around for 100 episodes too long.  It just doesn't mean anything.  The movie is like one big run on sentence.  Try and figure out what is going to happen three or four scenes later and I'll bet you nine times out of ten that you are right.  And guess how it ends.  Go on, don't be shy, I know it's tough now, but give it a shot.The Majestic is a lazy, fat ass dog, napping under a tree on a scorching summer day.  It doesn't move, it doesn't wake up and if you took a quick glance at it, you would wonder if it were really breathing or not.
