This story of high school buddies trying to infiltrate a Florida brothel in the 1950s is neither classy nor sophisticated.It is, however, quite funny. Just sit back and watch the group of pals playing tricks on each other and sticking together when things turn serious. Watching it today brings back memories of some of the stupid things me and my high school friends did back in the late 1980s and early 1990s. We all tried to get into strip clubs before we were 18. We didn't see any trouble with breaking the law as long as nobody got hurt. We all were out to have a much sex as we possibly could. That's what a good portion of growing up for us guys is all about! That said, the events depicted in this film, such as destroying a night club and sticking our manhood through a hole in the girls' shower didn't happen. That's why films are made. They take ideas in our heads and try to show what would happen if they actually played out.Only the coldest and stiffest of men couldn't find anything to laugh about with this movie. It is in no way meant to be taken seriously. It has been criticized to the point of no return, though. Why? Are some people unable to laugh at juvenile pranks, or were they on the receiving end of them when they were in high school?If you had fun growing up, you will probably like this film. If you look back at your younger years with regret, then you most likely won't enjoy it.8 of 10 starsAnd just gotta add 4/4/2007...... RIP Bob Clark.

I hurt for 3 days from laughing so hard.There is a portion of the movie, beginning close to the 1 hour mark that is the absolute funniest 14 minutes ever put on film. This includes these three hilarious scenes Coach and Lassie in the boys locker room (Coach Brackett finds out why they call Miss Honeywell Lassie), then it segues to the guys peeping through the holes into the girls shower room, where Beulah Balbricker gets a 'handle' on Tommy's situation, immediately followed by the scene with Coach Brackett, Coach Warren and Head Coach Goodenough in Principal Carter's office with Beulah describing the incriminating mole. There were people out of their seats, laying on the floor of the theater screaming with laughter. I have yet to see another motion picture invoke this kind of hilarity in a movie theater. I saw it in the theater 2 or 3 times in it's original theatrical run with the same response. When it became available, I bought the VHS copy, then the laser disc copy and when I got the DVD a few month's ago, I watched it for the zillionth time and I still laugh my butt off when I see those scenes. The acting is great for a bunch of no-names, there are actually great multiple plot-lines (in addition to the typical get laid at any cost plot) and the cinematography, editing and sound is above average. They made this movie in 90 days for less than $4 million and it grossed $7 million opening weekend and has grossed over $100 million in theaters to date, most of that in 1982 dollars. The only thing I can say bad about Porky's is that they should have stopped after the first one. The first pathetic sequel (The Next Day) lacked humor, the second sequel (Porky's Revenge) had 30-year-olds playing teenagers and they had long-since lost their youthful charm.

On the other hand, if you are laid back, easy going, don't have to have an uplifting and moral story line, and appreciate comedy (often sexy and somewhat raw), you are going to love this movie.  The producer and director very obviously made this movie for the simple purpose of providing the audience with a lot of very funny comedy.  And they succeeded immensely (if you are laid back, easy going, etc.)  The scenes range from funny to hilarious.Buy or rent the video.  I've seen this on network TV and it is very sanitized.

The plot doesn't make much sense, and the characters don't behave rationally. But I don't care. Porky's is fun, transporting me back to a mythical time in America when it was great to be a teenager. Life was a lark, issues were black and white, and all endings are happy. In this regards Porky's resembles many of Disney's movies like Pollyanna, a haunt of other guilty pleasures.

The essence of juvenile & vulgar comedies lies here within this film, and arguably also Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Animal House, but definitely not in the lame and uninspired nowadays flicks such as American Pie. All the classic gags and politically incorrect jests are here small penis jokes, big penis jokes, sticking penises in usual things, voyeurism through minuscule peepholes, the eternal virgin nerd, loud-screaming girls, redneck humor and much more. If you ever wondered where Bart Simpson found the inspiration for his prank calls, well that's probably because he watched Porky's as well! This is the simplistic tale of a bunch of teenage friends, all of them with incontrollable raging hormones, attending high school in the 1950's. In their never ending journey to get laid, they battle against all types of annoying authorities (read adults) like gym coaches, parents, police officers and obnoxious nightclub owners. Particularly this last group forms a severe obstacle, as the boys are desperately trying to get into a strip club in a neighboring county but the owner &#x96; a fat and sleazy hillbilly nicknamed Porky &#x96; and his gang of local yokels get a kick out of humiliating and beating up juvenile visitors. In between all their hectic adventures at school, the group plots the ultimate act of vengeance against Porky and his whole county of hillbilly freaks. Personally I don't understand how you could NOT enjoy a movie like Porky's, as it is so stimulating, cheerful and harmlessly infantile. The main characters are delightfully stereotypical high school bastards (especially the unforgettable Pee Wee) and some of the situations they find themselves stuck in are indescribably hilarious. A few of the highlights include an outrageous sex sequence with future Sex and the City starlet Kim Cattrall and the legendary coach Balbricker's quest to have one of the boys suspended for obscenities in the girls' shower. Needless to say Porky's is a sex comedy chock-full of gratuitous T & A (and enough wool to knit a sweater with&#x85;) and crude insinuations, but if this movie is too offensive for you already, you better sing up in a convent straight away. This was the biggest box office hit for the versatile writer/director Bob Clark, who directed pleasant comedies like this as well as creepy horror movies like Black Christmas and Dead of Night. He sadly died in a dramatic car accident in 2007. Thanks to films like Porky's, he at least leaves behind a spirited heritage! Rest in peace, Mr. Clark.

This is absolutely one of the funniest films I have ever seen.  And the reason for that hilarity is because of it's frankness and propensity to take risks. They don't make movies like this anymore.  Everyone is so worried about the damn sensors and that is too bad because a movie like this, while I can acknowledge may not be for everyone's taste, is one that explores teens in high school and it also explores how innocently cruel we were to each other in high school.What makes this film so funny is that the characters look like they are having fun.  They like to mess with each other.  They enjoy embarrassing one another and they are sex starved high school kids.  And really, weren't a lot of us males like that in high school?  Are a lot of us still not like that?You have an assorted cast of characters from Meat, the rather large ( in many ways ) guardian of the group.  Women love him for various reasons and it is his size and manliness that makes him so much fun to poke fun at. Then there is Tommy Turner.  He is the leader of the group and always seems to come up with the ideas to get his friends laid or in trouble.  You have Billy and Brian and of course PeeWee.  He is the guy that everyone likes, yet his exaggerated Casanova stories get him in several sticky but funny situations with his friends.  The characters at Angel Beach high school are hilarious and I honestly wish I could have known guys like this.The true strength of this film is the hilarity.  The kids make it funny because they always look like they are having fun.  When one person is taking their licks, the other five that are in on the gag are laughing under their breaths and all you get is a snicker or two.  And we can all relate to that.  How, something is funny but we have to play our part to keep the cherade going.  These kids do that with perfection here.  I also have to mention some of the scenes that make this film the teen classic that it is. The first is the scene when Mr. Carter, their principal is being pressured by Ms. Balbricker to find the guy who had his penis hanging out of a drain pipe in the girls shower.  Mr. Carter is doing his best to keep a straight face but he is going to crack at the absurdity of the request.  To make matters worse, the two male gym teacher are not making it any easier by snickering to themselves.  When Mr. Carter finally cracks, we crack with him.  This is comedy at it's best.  Also very funny are the Lassie part and the beginning when PeeWee is running down a country road naked.  You really have to see it.This film is unapolegetically crude, lude and vulgar in many ways.  But it is so damn funny that you don't pay attention to that stuff.  My gut still hurts from laughing when I watch this film.  And oh yeah, the shower scene isn't bad either.

Porky's pretty much came out of no where in the early 1980s and became a surprise smash hit - largely due to its imaginative ad campaign, but also because the film delivers on exactly what it promises.Set in the early 1950s at a Florida high school, the film follows the mischievous adventures of a gang of high school students on the hunt to lose their virginity, with various obstacles thrown in their path. Porky's is the name of a legendary strip joint where the gang is thrown out of and humiliated at in the beginning. Porky's is owned by the titular character - a Boss Hog-type involved in various shady activities whose brother, the sheriff, aids and abets. The gang agrees to set aside personal differences to pool resources and get some revenge on Porky and his pals.Dissed by the critics who could not understand the film's popularity, the film is really like American Graffiti with nudity on Viagra. The success of the film as a sex comedy is not hard to understand. First, the guys that comprise the gang are distinctive enough and well-played enough to engage the viewer. A number of familiar faces and character actors pop up. It is not a stretch to wonder whether Kim Cattrall's performance as a sexy gym teacher nicknamed Lassie did not help influence her casting in her ideal role years later on Sex and the City. Solid actors like Alex Karras, Susan Clark and Boyd Gaines show up in various roles. Nancy Parsons is pretty hilarious as the nightmarish gym teacher Ms. Balbricker, who becomes a thorn in the side of the guys. The sequence where she tries to convince the principal to have a line-up of the male students' privates so that she can identify which private she caught in the girl's shower room, while her fellow gym teachers snigger away behind her is worth the price of admission. Of the guys, Don Monahan is probably the most memorable as the eternally luckless Pee Wee, who forever manages to get humiliated in some fashion. Kaki Hunter is also pretty good as the lead girl, delivering a healthy dose of no-bull bluntness.The film has a good share of belly laughs and is not afraid to push buttons. It even manages to sneak in an anti-bigotry message. It also succeeds because it is actually able to appeal across the genders. While the search for guys to lose their virginity was recycled over and over again in other films, few had the success of Porky's and its sequels. This is for several reasons. First, while the guys are not above leering at naked girls, the girls are not afraid to give back as good as they get and are oftentimes in on the joke. The film's matter-of-fact, unguilty embrace of sex and nudity is a plus. The notorious scene with the guys spying on the girls in the shower becomes far less exploitive when the girls discover the perpetrators and start antagonizing them. On a side note, what a refreshing twist it would be to have a scene like this with the genders reversed - do filmmakers not think that young girls have any sexual curiosity? Additionally, while the film has a healthy dose of female nudity, it is also refreshingly awash in male nudity - including surprising frontals - so that the girls dragged along to this by their significant others at least have some eye candy of their own to enjoy. This is something other films of this ilk more often than not failed to get.In the end, for low-brow laughs, nudity and titillation, it is simply hard to find another sex comedy - then or now - that delivers it better than Porky's. The fact that this remains true nearly 30 years later must count for something.

The jokes are almost entirely based solely on sex. Such gags as Cherry Forever, Mike Hunt, Lassie(..Miss Honeywell's response to the smell of a boy's locker room), Ms. Balbricker's request for a mole inspection(..after letting something slip through her fingers)and the principal's response to such a scenario(tallywacker), all contribute to the crude hilarity that is Porky's. While tame compared to even PG-13 comedies today, Porky's is certain to offend some with it's naughty humor. And, before there was Meg Ryan's fake orgasm in When Harry Met Sally, there was Ms. Honeywell(Kim Cattrall, who would've had to have been a major wet dream for many teenagers at that time, I imagine, was a fox!)announcing to the whole gym what a real one sounds like! And, Dan Monahan's Pee Wee is a priceless character, finally getting his cherry popped at the end, securing a neverending pursuit of satisfying a lengthly quest. Good support by Art Hindle as a police officer whose younger brother, Mickey(Roger Wilson)wouldn't halt waging war against Porky(..the massive Chuck Mitchell). Interesting enough, Susan Clark(..as Cherry Forever)and Alex Karras(..as Sheriff Wallace, Porky's brother)both would later star as husband and wife on the popular sitcom Webster. The cast work incredibly well together and share a camaraderie that's actually quite poignant, even though their topic of choice is chicks(..my kind of guys).The drama aspects are also here. One of the group of horny males is a kid named Ted whose abusive father just got released from serving time for homicide. There's an emphasis on accepting a Jewish student who, for a time, was frowned upon, but is actually a hospitable guy. But, the core is a large repulsive strip bar owner in the next county from where most of the film is set, named Porky whose equally repellent brother is the sheriff. The boys attempt to pay for sex from some of his girls, get tricked and humiliated, and seek revenge against him for their mistreatment. So there are alternating story lines which accompany the main point of the students seeking sexual fulfillment so they can no longer dream of what it's like.The grand finale, when the gang put together a plan to get Porky back for putting their stubborn friend in the hospital because he wouldn't quit returning to the bar to get revenge, adds the exclamation point, even though we're asked to believe they could get away with it just through crossing over into another county.

There isn't any character development or a through plot line -- going to the strip club Porky's is only representative of two major scenes in the movie. It's about high school kids horsing around and trying to get laid in Florida in the '50s. There are some admirable but pointless subplots fixed on anti-Semitism and parent abuse, but it's just about laughs.What makes Porky's unique is that it's about laughter, it's not just about creating it for the sake of being a comedy film. A stand-out scene is when the strict oafish gym teacher Ms.Ballbricker is explaining to the principal her plan to identify a trouble-making student by lining up several of the boys to examine their manhood. In the background, two of the students are dying from laughter and even the principal at one point can't hold it in any longer -- then a nice close-up of a portrait of President Eisenhower with a big grin on his face. That sums up Porky's nicely we all need to laugh at the ridiculousness and humor of certain situations. If only the film spent a bit more time hammering that in instead of meandering about like a bored high schooler.This is a film you can watch over and over again, not only because it can be funny for all appropriate ages, but it only thrives from scene to scene. The entire high school-aged fantasy of boys getting spy on the girls' showers owes its birth to this film, the hilarity as the new gym coach learns why the attractive young girls' coach is nicknamed Lassie, and of course that ultimate revenge against the powers that be, in this case Porky and his redneck sheriff brother, who try and stop kids from having fun. It can be watched one scene at a time -- there's nothing gluing it all together.Bob Clark's film has a carefree and reckless attitude that resembles that of his characters, but as admirable as that is -- and a rare find in a movie indeed, especially comedy -- there's no doubt that Porky's avoids being the kind of coming-of-age film it could have been. There's no substitute for memorable characters in addition to unforgettable scenes, but Porky's viewers can at least relish the latter.

Basically it is 1954, and we are following a group of high school teens going through puberty, and only thing on their minds, sex. We have horny toad Pee Wee (Dan Monahan), bad boy Tommy (Wyatt Knight), tough jock and abnormally packaged Meat (Tony Ganios), wise-ass redneck without any care Mickey (Roger Wilson), smart Jew Brian Schwartz (Scott Colomby), and racist Tim (Cyril O'Reilly). So they are peaking through holes to the girl's shower room, and making life difficult for teachers and each other, and then they find striptease bar Porky's, only to be thrown out and humiliated soon after entering. They realise they won't get in, so they plan revenge, but they know that owner Porky (Chuck Mitchell), his brother is Sheriff Wallace (Alex Karras), making it difficult, and they also have to forget their differences to work together. Also starring Mark Herrier as Billy, young Sex and the City's Kim Cattrall as Honeywell, Kaki Hunter as Wendy, Nancy Parsons as Ms. Balbricker and Susan Clark as Cherry Forever. The highlights of the film for me are young Cattrall having sex, and her screams echoing in the below basketball court, and after peaking at the girls, one of the guys sticks his penis through one of the holes, and gets it clutched by the teacher. It is quite tasteless, but there is a tiny strange sense of charm about it also, a quite entertaining comedy. Worth watching!

I know he's gonna hate me because to be honest, I didn't really find it that funny. It just seemed like a typical teen sex comedy that was more gross and unrealistic than actual comedy. But I admit that I did have a couple of laughs here and there, the story wasn't really that bad.Basically a bunch of boys in high school are determined to get laid. Some have been laid before, but there is a guy they call Pee-Wee, understandably by his lack of a package, they take him to a strip joint called Porky's. There they give the owner, Porky, a hundred dollars to have the strippers for an hour, but Porky tricks the boys and ends up humiliating them instead. So throughout the movie one of the boys keeps going back to get revenge and finally they all just do it together for the ultimate revenge tactic.Porky's did have a few funny scenes, like the love scene between the coach and Honeywell, played by a very young Kim Catrell, her screaming was so hilarious. Then the female gym teacher going after the boys because they were teasing the girls in the locker room through the peep holes, she was pretty funny.

Plus the whole gag involving one guy shoving his penis through the peephole is totally hilarious. 2) There's something for the ladies, too. A bunch of young guys disrobe and bare their entire bodies as well, so this film can't be accused of being sexist. 3) Kim Cattrall. She's always been (and still is) a major babe. Well, she's absolutely delectable here as a luscious coach who howls like a dog while making love to a fellow high school coach in a men's locker room. 4) The cast have a ball with their roles. Dan Monahan portrays the libidinous Pee Wee with impish charm and glee to spare. Kaki Hunter is likewise absolutely adorable as the brash Wendy. Popping up in nifty supporting parts are Nancy Parsons as the uptight gym teacher Ms. Ballbricker, Chuck Mitchell as detestable brothel owner Porky, Alex Karras as a corrupt sheriff, Eric Christmas as the meek principal, and Susan Clark as a bawdy prostitute. 5) The anti-Semiticism subplot about one guy who antagonizes a Jewish student because his brutish dad beats him up is surprisingly strong and poignant. Moreover, it's real heavy stuff for a comedy. 6) The picture's outrageously raunchy sense of no-holds-barred crude'n'rude humor will never win awards for either taste or subtlety, but it's nonetheless constantly funny in a blithely lowbrow sort of way. 7) It's a well-made little flick with slick cinematography, a rockin' score, and a catchy golden oldies soundtrack. 8) Writer/director Bob Clark.

Now that I've had the opportunity to watch the film for myself, I found it a surprisingly tolerable if uneven comedy - and occasionally uproarious; thankfully, the teenagers here aren't as obnoxious as in other films of its ilk. It also takes care to provide mild social commentary by having its characters stand up for a put-upon member of the Jewish community.Though some gags eventually grow repetitive or outstay their welcome, its best moments are the following the scene with the prostitute played by Susan Clark, the numerous clashes with the obese female teacher (especially the shower scene and its aftermath in the headmaster's office) and the climactic demolition of Porky's red-neck establishment.

I do, however, find the film's raunchy antics nowhere near as funny as its characters, and director Bob Clark, obviously think they are.The 'Mike Hunt' telephone gag which has the teens in stitches isn't that hilarious, or original, having been conceived in the mid '70s by pranksters John Elmo and Jim Davidson; the repeated jokes about penises soon become very tedious; and as much as I enjoy seeing a young Kim Cattrall without her kecks on, her 'Lassie' scene is embarrassingly bad and far too drawn out.

I was therefore surprised how much I disliked Porky's (considering the fact that the central idea from American Pie has been lifted from Porky's - the only difference is that in American Pie they make a pact to lose their virginity before Prom night). I think what made the Pie films better was that the writers seemed to make more of an effort to develop the main characters and I think for that reason it made it easier to identify with them.In Porky's rather than giving us characters we can identify with or relate to the writers give us characters that, at best we are unable to connect with, and at worst are going to end up hating. Many of the jokes in the film are crass without being funny and much of the dialogue is clumsy, irritating and unfunny. The writing is also very uneven whereby it starts out as a bunch of high school kids wanting to lose their virginity and then that concept is all but abandoned in place of gaining revenge against ol Porky himself. I can perhaps understand the change of tone as I was losing interest in their quest as well so perhaps the writers did too. This shift in tone admittedly makes the second half of the film slightly better than the first half, but it's still pretty weak - although I did find the final act quite amusing even though I could see it coming a mile off. Some people may condemn a film like Porky's for its lack of subtlety, but I think that's probably a little unfair (that's a bit like criticising a porn film for having poor acting or a lack of plot). The sign for Porky's that we see at the start is beyond suggestive, but to me much of the humour felt a little forced rather than feeling natural. The performances from the cast are variable - none of the male leads are that good and are rather forgettable. Kim Cattrall isn't given much to do in the first half, but she does have one memorable scene in the second half (she looks good here too). Nancy Parsons is the scene stealer in this film as the feisty PE Teacher who's aptly named Balbricker.Ending on a positive note there were a couple of scenes that I did enjoy; the shower scene with Balbricker was funny as was the aftermath of the event. The prank call to the diner was quite funny as well even though I'd heard the joke before. Porky's is more than likely where the creators of The Simpsons got their idea from with Bart's prank calls to Moe. All in all Porky's isn't completely terrible, but there are nowhere near enough laughs to warrant the running time.

The boys come up with a plan to take revenge on Porky. Finally Pee Wee gets his time with Wendy Williams.There was Animal House in the beginning. Porky's takes it up a notch. Some complain about the denigration of women but one of the best character in the movie is Wendy Williams. If the women are denigrated, Pee Wee is the most ridiculed of them all in the movie.

Part of the reason is that it's Bob Clark, and that movie's not nearly as funny as A Christmas Story. Along with that, the VHS box (saw it a lot as a kid) left me to believe there'd be a lot more nudity than there really is (a surprising deficiency). For a horny teen comedy, there have to at least be some hot chicks, right? All we get is a shower scene full of breasts. One scene. Seriously? It does have Kim Cattrall, but she's criminally underused, even at that point in her career. But what's the point of aiming at the sex-crazed teen crowd if you're running short on tits? At least supplement it with decent comedy.4/10 "},{"Title":"Tame for today's standards.","Date":"2 January 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" I remember in junior high the shock and excitement about Porky's! The forbidden pleasure concept is out of date. With internet porn, cable, every other sex comedy trying to out do the other with toilet humor Porky's is tame and or lame by today's standards. The nudity and pranks/stunts are used in mainstream comedy. (ie The Hang Over) Even a few of the concepts would never be used with today's 24 7 cable news, with sexual predators, hazing incidents etc. Anyone peeking in the girls showers in today's environment would be a candidate for intense counseling. The male bonding, and pranks of the 1980's are of a gone by era, where a hand shake after a fist fight was common. I like the music, and had a few cheap laughs from Porky's which was low story line. The story-line of messing with Porky got across as lame for anyone who remembers the, sinister, Harlan DeGroat character from Out of the Furnace movie. Overall six Porky's out of ten.

But this Bob Clark movie isn't American at all, it's an Canadian film, so Porky's can be classed as one of the highest-grossing Canadian film of all time in Canada's domestic box office, with over the total of $111Million CDN. Set in the 1950's, the film charts the usual round of high school jerks who's sole purpose in life is getting laid with seems more trouble than it's worth. There was just something smug and smarmy about their attempts to have sex that makes you wish that they get what deserves for their pre-adolescent actions. The actors don't even look like they belong in high school nor does they look like they should be allow to be on school grounds with such stalking and pervert like actions. If this was a real life, their actions would have leaded to criminal convictions and require them to register as sex offenders for the rest of their lives. I don't like films that glorifies their actions. The adults in this film are not better. For somebody running a school in high school in Eisenhower Conservatism America, their principal makes light of the boys actions. To make matters worse, the two male gym teacher are not making it any easier by snickering to themselves. It is simply a teen exploitation film put together by a bunch of adults with actors in their early twenties pretending to be high school kids and adults being children. It's hard to sympathize with them with all the unappealingly misogynistic and vile. You want them to get hurt by the end. It doesn't matter, if it's the girl's school shower room antics, where one of the gang actually gets a lot more than he bargained for or Porky's nightclub who humiliates the kids and steal their money. This movie is so raunchy, but it's less about sex, but more about revenge against the people that does them, wrong. Most of the movie is trying to get revenge against Porky's nightclub. There is a sub plot saying that people of different religions and beliefs need to more understanding. Wow, that's seems out of place. Was this thrown in to make it socially relevant? It's doesn't help the movie when its show cast more nudity, than social tolerance. There is a lot of nudity, both male and female. Sadly sex sells, even if the jokes are awful. The T&A doesn't titillate as much now as it did then, but you can still imagine teen boys laughing hysterically the first time they watch it. It's not what one would call a deep or engrossing movie though. It lacks the complexity and genius of an Animal House or American Graffiti. Both based on 1950's teenager sex-life. The movie has two familiar characters that audience will remember most, which are Edward Pee Wee Morris (Dan Monahan) who is the funniest of the group, despite being a one dimension character. Pee Wee is so named because of his little man part, and inability to score. Another would be Coach Beulah Balbricker (Nancy Parsons) who borderline cartoony with her butch female coach look. Another note character would be Kim Cattrall as Miss Honeywell. Miss Honeywell earns her legendary nickname of Lassie, the description of the wanted poster for the male private part. Don't get me wrong, I have an sense of humor, but overall, this film a sexist and primitive film, whom never either condones or rejects their behavior. I just can't watch this film any more than once. Unfortunately it spawned 2 bad sequels as well. Not worth it, in my watch list.

Many years before American Pie came along, this little treasure did. The actors here, most who never went on to anything, are so good and damn believable, they simply melt into their characters. Sadly one actor, Wyatt Knight, a.k.a. Tommy Turner, the impish teen who was always at war with Ms Beulah Ballbreaker, the overweight female soccer coach, topped himself last year as suffering from some cancer. One guy, pee wee (Dan Monahan) the laughing butt of his friends, wants so desperately to get laid, one classic hoax scene near the start of the movie, has him scared out of his wits, running down a highway, naked. He even has a penis chart he keeps tabs on. At the advice of one of their friends, where his own advice nearly gets him half dead, they head to this bordello out in the Florida glades run by fat corrupt owner, Porky, who's brother runs the sheriff house next door, just as corrupt. Porky's promising them a night to remember, rips them off, the most cheesed off of the boys, Mick (Roger Wilson?). The Sheriff even smashes up Mick's car a little, to stretch his warning, to never return. Mick goes back and back, obsessed with getting even with Porky, the second time, the most dramatic, with him ending up in the hospital, so a certain revenge awaits, as the boys of Angel Beach with a help from authorities (Mick's brother a cop) get revenge, two fold and pee wee finally gets laid. Porky's is not all a comedy. It has a little drama, where a little is to be said about racism too. One of the new kids, Brian, a Jewish boy, isn't accepted by one of the mob, Steve, because of this. But we see why. Steve's dad, a real piece of .... has drummed it into him as well as his fists where he's a regular punching bag of his Dad's. Porky's is better than a lot of sex comedies, whether it's Up The Creek, Where The Boys Are, or the unbelievably cheesy and degrading, Screwballs. It's a sex comedy on a higher plane of worth, dealing with real characters and real issues. The eye peeking scene through the girls shower block is funny, but what will really crack you up, so much, you almost feel like you're having a heart attack is the next one. Ms Beulah Ballbreaker, such a miserable so and so, who pulled onto something she shouldn't of, is describing to the small and gawky principal, 70's, in great length the incident, but more so her plan of strategy which has the three basketball coaches in the background, in fits of laughter as this scene will have you. It's one of the funniest scenes in movie history. One head, drowning in a bowl of chili scene, may put you off it for good, plus witness the world's biggest rubber, that fits perfectly over Pee Wee's head.

The jokes are tame and the emphasis isn't on titillation but rather humour stemming from the libidos of the central characters. The surprise is that this is actually an entertaining, well thought out movie with a heart.

The students from Angel Beach, Florida, were addicted to sex in whatever way they could get it. They get inventive in ways that some of their contemporaries never thought possible.On second viewing, Bob Clark's 1982 Porky's, still packs a punch in the way the people depicted went about their salad days getting into all kinds of problems. The frank talk in the film will turn off, and may be offensive to a lot of viewers. Mr. Clark captures the mentality of the times vividly, right down to the way most of these kids viewed their lives, and that of others.Nancy Parsons made a mean coach Balbricker. Kim Cattrall, who went to bigger and better things, and Kaki Hunter, one of the trashiest teens ever seen on a film, are good.

Forget John Hughes, Bob Clark's Porky's was definitive to us as Animal House was to our older brothers and sisters.       It strikes me as funny to keep reading references to the actors in this film as a bunch of Unknowns. They aren't unknown; they're the cast of Porky's, darnit, they're icons! What's more, the characters they create here are distinct, appealing, and funny. Sometimes it's better to use actors who are a little bit older, and therefore wiser, than the types they are spoofing.   People deride this movie's trashy story line. Comedy is designed to depict humans in their baser states of being. If Porky's is nothing more than a low-budget, low-brow farce, well shoot, that's all it was meant to be. Desperation is the key element of farce. A bunch of teenage boys who desperately want to get laid is a situation both timeless and humorous.   Sure, this is mostly a guy's film, and it definitely objectifies women. But women went to see this movie and laughed at the mostly-male antics. They received equal opportunity to view the men on-screen in an objectifying manner, too, since most of the guys in the movie shed their clothes at one point or another.      Filming people who are laughing at their own jokes is not always funny. But the scene in the Principal's office where the three phys-ed coaches are desperately trying not to laugh while Miss Balbricker states her case against Tommy Turner is perfectly executed and side-splitting. Even President Eisenhower agrees!   It'd be funny if Hollywood spent a fortune re-making a movie that was made this cheaply, and got it all wrong this time around.

But it is what it is, and that's a funny, kinky, wild comedy, and it's carved out its own niche in comedy cinema.Basically, the plot centers around four or five high school boys in the 1950's who are desperate to get laid.  There's a few subplots here and there, involving everything from the titular strip joint to anti-semitism, but basically the movie is a showcase for gags involving the boys getting into various misadventures involving their johnsons.There's the famous shower scene, which starts as a gratuitous excuse to show a half dozen naked girls, but then turns into a side-splittingly funny slapstick masterpiece.  There's the infamous Lassie scene, in which a young, hot and bare-bottomed Kim Cattrall demonstrates why she's nicknamed after the world's most famous canine.Unlike a lot of raunch comedies which try to excuse their excessive crudeness by throwing in some sort of socially redeeming subject matter, writer/director BOB CLARK handles the semi-serious aspects of the movie with surprising ease, smoothly fitting them into the rest of the story.If you haven't seen PORKY'S, then check it out.

So we follow this band of horny young men on their quest to see some breasts. They go to a nightclub where love is for sale but that trip doesn't end up going according to plan. In the movie's most famous scene they spy on a group of girls in the shower. At least that leads to a pretty funny scene in which coach Beulah Balbricker, whose name tells you all you need to know, lays out her plan to identify one of the peeping Toms. Sadly, that's pretty much the only funny scene in the movie. And what the movie lacks in laughs it doesn't make up for in outrageousness. Porky's has a reputation for being wild and raunchy but it is actually rather tame. If the most outrageous thing in your movie is a scene featuring a handful of girls in a shower for a minute or two your movie is not particularly outrageous at all. So there's no laughs, no raunch, and pretty much no plot. That's not a formula for a successful teen sex comedy. Toss in the fact that supporting characters, such as the aforementioned Balbricker, are more interesting than the guys the movie actually focuses on and the movie is clearly doomed to fail. The fact that the character of Pee Wee, who is focused on most of all, is incredibly annoying certainly doesn't help matters any. The fact that the threadbare plot ultimately leads to a simply absurd climax is just the final insult. Porky's is noted for helping to launch the teen sex comedy genre. It may be among the first, it's certainly among the worst.

Feinberg, an elementary school located on Washington Avenue in South Beach (for those not familiar, if you've heard of Ocean Drive, Washington Avenue is one street over). Behind Leroy D. there was a large white building that used to be an adult school; some of our classes were held there. This building was also the set of Porky's. I was too young to see Porky's in the theater &#x96; had to wait for that all-important late-night cable sneaky-view &#x96; a staple of teenagers in Generation X. I loved what I saw, but what boy wouldn't? You talk about sex a lot, and show naked girls, any teenage boy is gonna be smiling. And I felt a connection to it because it had been filmed at my school. But recently, for fun, I've been re-watching movies that meant a lot to me as a kid. Some, like Risky Business and The Sure Thing, still hold up. Porky's, though, doesn't hold up, but it is interestingly odd.First off, they don't make them like this anymore. This kind of unabridged sex urges and casual racism doesn't fly in the PG-13 world. In many ways, these kids' (who bordered on actually being 30 when the movie was filmed!)racial attitudes are both despicable and realistic given they're supposed to be 50's era high schoolers. There's a scene at the beginning where three characters discuss the plan to hire a N-word to scare the others in a prank; yeah, two of them scold the southern boy for using the word, but it's a casual scold and then answer, yeah they got one. Their description of him is even more offensive, right down to his low-level labor-status and gold teeth. There's another scene where two of the kids tell the Jewish kid that, hey &#x96; they're sorry about the racism of their friend, but he ain't a bad guy and they gotta support him because, you know, he's their bud. The casualness of all this is shocking &#x96; the film kinda accepts it as correct &#x96; which it is, given the era the film is representing, but still. This is a comedy and it's bordering on maybe being too accurate in the worst ways.This doesn't make the movie evil, though. Bob Clark wrote and directed a slice of life film that got the reputation for being the daddy of all high school sex flicks. It is a sex comedy, but I think it's also a 50's era portrait of high school. It's not well rendered on that level, but it is that. And so Clark incorporating racism and casually dealing with it isn't offensive on that level &#x96; and to be fair to him In the end, the characters bond with the Jewish kid. He does try to come out on the right side of things.But the weirdest part of the film? It's acted and shot in a way that the majority of the characters are difficult to distinguish; if you noticed, so far I haven't named any characters, because I can't remember them. Save for Meat or Pee Wee, named for their, um, god-given abilities, it's tough to remember these characters' names. I think that has to do with the big three the writing, acting, and mainly the direction &#x96; unlike most films aimed at teenagers, Clark avoids cloying musical interludes, close-ups and punch-line dialogue &#x96; instead he films group shots with a lot of overlapping speech, offhand jokes, and laughter (have you ever seen so much on screen laughter in a movie? I haven't and I admit, it works &#x96; it does make a lot of scenes seem funnier, especially the tally-whacker inspection scene). If you think about it, either Clark's techniques here are unexpectedly arty or incompetent and make the film uninvolving on a character level (probably both). It's a slow film, too, with often telegraphed from a mile away jokes that still many times hit, somehow (case in point the screamer. Who couldn't see the joke coming &#x96; Clark takes forever to get to it and yet, it does end up getting some chuckles.) Outside of those chuckles, though, what's left for a modern audience to enjoy? Not much. It's a raunchy comedy with a slow pace, little music, and remote, often boring personalities played by actors who look like they're in grad school rather than high school; it contains casual racist and sexist attitudes that are bound to un-funnily offend because they aren't underlined and loudly pronounced bad. The Regan Era was the last time that the 50's could not only be romanticized, but tolerated. That era of segregation and conformity has passed us by, thankfully(it had cool cars, though). Rock n'Roll was a sign, as were the Beats, that something was off in this decade for so many, and no matter how much Regan wanted to paint the 50's as the perfect America, he was bound to fail; nostalgia for this decade worked from the early 70's into the 80's because of all the strife going on, but eventually, I think people realized or remembered a lot of that strife happened because of the 50's way of thinking. Porky's was a Regan Era film thru and thru which ironically, he would have hated. But nowadays, like the 50's itself, it seems racist, sexist, and a little slow.

It was just a movie that was really funny and can probably be considered a flip-off to the really nice prim and properness that most people still associate with the 50s. After all, am I the only one who knows that Elvis's hip movements were considered so blatantly sexual during that decade that when he performed on the Ed Sullivan Show (which captured the attention of at least 60 million viewers) they filmed him from the waist up? I know the movie is anything but deep and profound, but seeing as how other teen movies like She's All That and Crossroads are nothing shy of cheesy garbage, I was thrilled to discover a teen movie which focuses on teens who are anxious to get laid.

Even though I am not a fan of this movie, I give director Bob Clark some props as a diverse film maker. He has worked on a wide range of films from Black Christmas to A Christmas Story. A Christmas Story works much better as a period piece of the 50's and is a much better film as well. However, the two pictures are much different and that is where their similarities begin and end. Unlike many other movies that people consider to be classics, I don't think the movie aged well. Porky's as a movie is not that spectacular and while the acting performances are not bad, they are not great and do not elevate this substandard film. Plus most of the jokes are pretty dated, dumb and not funny. I can absolutely understand why critics panned this movie on its release. It is dumb. However, Porky's was a huge hit.

Not to say it's bad, but most of the movie is a few chuckles, smiles, maybe a few memories of your adolescent years. What it boils down to is this is only funny if you've been through something like this or can recall your quest for sexual satisfaction.Even someone's strangest quest for pleasure probably wouldn't touch some of the desperation focused on in Porky's. It aims below the belt, and sometimes results in either a hilarious scene or an awkwardly thrown together one. I knew what I was getting into when I hit play, so don't accuse me of misjudging or misinterpreting this film.The plot is a group of high school boys in 1954, Tommy Turner, Edward Pee Wee Morris, Anthony Meat Tuperello, Mickey Jarvis, Billy McCarthy, and Tim Cavanaugh, are content on losing their virginity and will do it whatever way they can. They first try to go to a rundown shack at midnight in hopes to get lucky with a stripper, but end up humiliated. The next guess is to try to go to Porky's and pay for sex. This seems inches away from happening when the owner, Porky, dumps them in a swamp after taking their money. Now it becomes a quest of sex and payback.Porky's is sort of like a steam roller on a newly-tarred street. It paved the way for other teen movies (cars) to follow. It was like the leader of the pack in 1982 next to the 1978 classic Animal House. So, in its own respect, it should be recognized and someway appreciated for that.But by the time the end scene rolls around, we don't feel accomplished. Our characters certainly do, but for some reason, the movie seemed to want to focus on so much in such a little time frame. In order to do so many things with the same characters you have to first introduce them properly and give them their own chance to speak. That is done here, but the development isn't very large. I could probably write one, two sentences max on each character.I liked Kim Cattrall as the drop-dead gorgeous teacher, but wasn't very amused by the Lassie scene. I liked many of the boys and wanted to learn more about them, but didn't. Porky's has laughs and a few smiles, but not enough to recommend to someone looking for a great comedy. If someone asks me a film with screwball antics and below the belt jokes Porky's will be the first film that will come out of my mouth.Starring Dan Monahan, Mark Herrier, Wyatt Knight, Roger Wilson, and Kim Cattrall.

Tolerable after a few beers.Unfortunately, most of the jokes are old and stale or obvious with too long of a set-up. Mike Hunt may have been hilarious in 1953, but not in 1981 and certainly not today. The opening scene where the boys are naked waiting to get laid and a black guy jumps out with a knife seems to go on forever and the joke is spoiled before you even get to see it. We already know what's going to happen because they tell us and sure enough, that's exactly what happens. The film makers are violating some basic rules of comedy here.And even the much lauded scene where the two gym teachers have sex scene is likewise ruined. Gee, I wonder why they call her Lassie? Why might that be? Now having said that, a young and enthusiastic Kim Catrall saves that scene from being completely dreary.And what's the deal with the characters laughing like hyenas all over the place? There's nothing worse than someone trying to tell you a joke who can't spit it out because they're laughing so hard. Funny for them, not for you.

Porky's takes us back to the good ole days when sex was EVERYTHING to a teenage boy.  That's right, some may beg to differ by saying what's changed? it's still everything.  In some ways they would be right, but this was back in a day before drugs had really taken off and the only ones smoking pot on a regular basis were jazz musicians.  The story centers on a high school virgin (PeeWee) and his buddies, their quest to get laid, and all of the hijinks and pranks that ensue.  Speaking of pranks, this has some of the BEST pranks ever put on film  PERIOD.  This fun-loving group tries EVERYTHING in their power to get laid.  When one of them suggests that they take the 70 mile journey, down to the swamps, to a legendary red-neck dive called Porky's, the group happily pile in their cars and take the trip.  When the evil proprietor, Porky himself, takes their money and humiliates the guys, it's revenge time.The movie moves along at a nice leisurely pace, but things are NEVER boring.  There is always something going on that will have you in stitches.  Whether the boys are watching the girls through a peep-hole in the shower, or Pee Wee is going on and on like he's NOT a virgin, you will be cracking up.  I really don't want to give too much away for those who haven't seen it, but I will say that this one will find a place in your collection.  I wouldn't reccomend the sequels quite as enthusiastically, but they do have their moments.  If you loved Pie or Pie 2, this is your movie. That's all I gotta say about that.

Its influence can be seen in basically every teen sex comedy that has come out since its release in 1982. Even today, PORKY'S remains one of the funniest movies ever made. Everything about this movie is great. The characters are lovable, the dialogue is well written, the dramatic scenes work perfectly, and the film captures teenage like few films have been able to. Despite its excellence and cult status, Fox has yet to give it a decent DVD release. The DVD that is currently out right now is a bare-bones release with the only special feature on the disc being the theatrical trailer. There is hope however. Fox just released the hilarious FREAKED on DVD so obviously they are paying some attention to their cult films. I can't think of a greater movie that deserves a special edition DVD.

The boys go on with their antics but keep revenge on Porky at the back of their minds.I enjoyed American Pie and Something about Mary even though I thought they were stupid and tasteless, why?  Simply because they were funny.  So when I eventually go round to seeing this film I assumed that I'd feel the same way.  Plot barely matters here but it's worth noting that the plot of `revenge on Porky' is tagged onto the start and the end.  In between are tonnes of stupid antics round school.  This isn't a problem because who cares about the plot in these things yeah?  What matters is that it's funny.  And that's the problem for me.It isn't very funny.  It has it's moments, Balbricker demanding a penis line-up is one but that's about it.  The rest is so dumb and puerile that it isn't funny.  The antics are tired but they are very basic and show no real planning or humour.  It may be partly the fact that it almost 20 years old but still, I found it to be one of the most basic teen comedies I can remember seeing.I any of the cast went onto be stars then I certainly have never seen them.  Only Cattrall was one I knew now.  She plays a horny woman who screams like a wolf during sex &#150; the best thing about her performance was that I was amazed that she'd been typecast for about 20 years!  The rest of the cast are very average and we have the usual bunch of jocks, nerds etc having fun and learning to stand up to adult injustice etc.  It's not very inspiring at all.Overall I'm not a big fan of this type of teen comedy but I do find them funny on the whole.  Sadly this isn't very funny.  It has a couple of funny scenes or moments but really the rest is pretty thin on laughs.  There was plenty of stuff I knew should be funny but I just didn't laugh.  The Porky's stuff is mainly at the start and end and in-between feels like a run of gags that aren't joined together by anything.  Like I said- juvenile, puerile and just not that funny.

Well, Mother was right it is puerile, maybe even to the point of being unspeakably vulgar! But it's also a lot of fun.The plot is lightweight a group of sex-crazed Florida high school boys desperate to lose their virginity try to do precisely that by visiting Porky's, a swamp-water red-neck brothel and general den of iniquity. When they get robbed and beaten up by Porky and his minions, they plot an elaborate revenge that is... well... sure to bring down the house!The plot is really just the string that holds together a series of elaborate practical jokes--the sort of jokes you always heard about when you were a kid and wondered if any one ever really could pull them off. The largely no-name cast, especially Dan Monahan (Pee Wee, so named for his, er, shortcomings), Kaki Hunter (Wendy, the high school floozie), and Nancy Parsons (Beulah Balbricker, the Godzilla of girls' gym teachers), play it with an engagingly light touch--and somehow manage to give it an aura of innocence that adds to the movie's charm.The film drags a bit due to the script's well-intentioned but ho-hum subplot concerning the racism a Jewish boy encounters at Angel Beach High School, but that aside the comic episodes are a laugh riot--and it's impossible to describe them without giving the fun away. There's Cherry Forever, the discovery of why Miss Honeywell is called Lassie, the truly hilarious and infamous girls' shower scene and its aftermath in the principal's office... just one after another, thick and fast. It will never make any critic's shortlist, but if you're looking for mindless lunacy done with a youthful innocence, PORKY'S may just be the film you're looking for.

I've seen nudity in several teen sex comedies. This all done in a very not-sexy, not-funny (or fun for that matter) generic way.There are other films of the same time that were not misogynistic, one dimensional and mean-spirited (see The Last American Virgin, Fast Times At Ridgemount High and The Party Animal). And even more so - those films are actually funny and have characters that you remember. Porky's main cast are pretty faceless, generic guys. There's no depth or real personality to any of the characters to speak of.They are a group of friends who don't even seem to like each other. Pee-wee is perhaps ill-suited with these guys and then there's a rather tacked-on sub-plot of anti-Semitism involving Tim who is abused by his Father. Are we supposed to not feel sorry for Tim for being abused because he's an anti-Semite? Very pedestrian film-making aspiring to be a bit more indeed. Perhaps the film-makers are trying to tell us that prejudice, abuse and misogyny apparently were very much a thing that only existed in the 1950's? Actually I don't think they gave it any thought.If you are emotionally-stunted to that of a 9 year-old you may like this (because you don't know any better) and for those who believe that everything made in Canada is funny (If SCTV is a 10 then this is -8).

I saw it somewhat later in life (last night), and, man, I hated it. This is one behemoth of a bad movie with no redeeming quality to it. Sorry, all you Porky-lovers.The story centers loosely around a group of high school juniors and seniors who are all played by actors who are roughly ten years older. In the case of the girls, fifteen years older. Some seem to be pushing menopause. Others have brought along their children and grandchildren. One of the gang, Pee Wee, is desperate to get laid, others are peeping into the girls' shower (allowing us, the audience, to finally cop some T&A) and end up getting busted by the aptly named coach Ballbricker (geddit?), two teachers have it off and she (played by Kim Cattrall of Sex And The City, who somehow, throughout her career, consistently managed to get the part of the cute sexpot) howls like Lassie, and another plot involves some of the gang getting thrown out of a strip joint by the evil Southron Porky (hence the name of the movie) and his Southern Sheriff brother, and then taking revenge so epic and disproportional that it makes the bible's seventh son of a seventh' son rule look conciliatory. Some depth is added by addressing the weighty issues of antisemitism (How do you know to fight so well? -- As a Jew, it's either that or having to eat sheet. I don't like sheet. -- How often did you have to fight before? -- First time. -- So what was that talk about the difficulty of prevailing as a Jew about? -- Never mind, let's get on with the movie.), violent rock'n'rolling fathers, and pig-ugly fat prude cock-blocking sports coaches with 'double-entendre' names.I found the plot arbitrary, ambling and pointless, and the humour puerile, scatological and boorish. I felt like Jesse Jackson at a clan rallye. I didn't like the fact that men share a woman and discuss her sexual eccentricities among each other, I don't think it's good, clean, harmless fun for boys to peep into the girls' shower and stick their private parts in, or to collectively lose their virginity at a brothel or by group-banging a prostitute, or for a girl to have it off with a boy she doesn't fancy but merely at the behest of a group. I wasn't offended or anything, I was just bored.Like I said, if you have fond memories of watching this movie in '82 in a packed house, good for you. But right now you'd need a time machine to enjoy it.PS I thought that the actor playing Pee-Wee, Dan Monahan, looks like the spitting image of Ally McBeal's Peter MacMillan. I had to look them up here at IMDb to find out they're not identical.

Go snap some nudie footage of your girlfriend, sister, or whoever. Just don't slap it on the retail market and try to make money off of it.

This is the kind of film your stupid older brother or slightly retarded cousin who you're ashamed to be seen with in public would drool over. I know several people who consider it to be a classic, and they're all the kind of people you'd run through traffic to avoid. This is just mean-spirited, woman-hating, offensive junk that revels in the humiliation and degradation of its instantly unlikeable characters, then expects you to really care when bad things happen to them. You know you're in for a bad time when the characters on screen laugh more than the people in the audience. Laughter can be infectious, but if I ever found myself tittering at a piece of gutter trash like this, I'd report for psychotherapy the very next day.

What was all the laughing about?  Every scene in the movie had the characters laughing like fat albert and the gang.  Did I miss something?  I guess this must have been the directors idea.  Putting the laughing inside the movie in lieu of laugh tracks must be more realistic.  Maybe the director knew that he was directing am awful movie with no humor so he has to remind the public that they paid money to laugh.       With all that said, I must admit to watching it subsequent times when I have nothing better to do.  I do this just to remind myself that if things ever get bad in my life, I can at least say that I had nothing to do with the making of this horrible movie.

I go to a movie with the right attitude, open for anything. I had heard how hilarious this movie was when it came out, and went with friends to see it. I was terribly disappointed. I couldn't believe just how juvenile and ridiculous the humor was in this film.I use the word juvenile here, not to describe the type of comedy as much as the amount of intelligence it probably took to write the script. I mean, there's comedy that is raunchy, but funny (American Pie, There's Something About Mary, Kingpin), and then there's brainless, unclever, and predictable Porky's.In the theater I clearly remember watching the film and chuckling and laughing here and there...but not nearly as much as the characters on the screen were laughing. The same stood for everyone in the audience. The one scene that I always remember for this is the scene in the Principal's office with the two male gym teachers laughing in an uncontrollable frenzy. When the people who are laughing the most in the theater are on the screen, then something is wrong with the film.Oh yha, they have naked women in the showers - ooooh.

Porky is your typical redneck slob, and the teenagers were extremely disappointing. The only teen-sex movies made that deserve recognition are American Pie 1 & 2.The dialouge is tedious, not funny at all. It is a tedious 2 hour movie, and I struggled my way through it. Sat down and continued to wait for the funny part, which never came.It tries to tackle social issues of the 50's and currently (well, 1980's anyway), like gender, racism, anti-semitism & contraception, with very very very limited success.

After all, it's routinely spoken of by so many as the prototype teen/college movie, so I figured it would be several times better than today's movies of the same persuasion.I was wrong. The movie seemed to get off to a good start, but quickly lost steam and became nearly unwatchable due to the low quality of the filming. Twenty minutes into the movie, I wanted to turn it off. The hallmark of a classic movie is that it still holds its appeal 20, 30, or 40 years after it was made. Porky's is not a classic. From a cinematic point of view, the character development is horrible by today's standards. Also, he movie is made like it's the first movie ever to contain female breasts, which is extremely irritating.The jokes are horribly outdated, even for 1982. They might be funny to the 50 and 60-somethings who appreciate crude misogyny, racism, and fart jokes, but to me, they were just pathetic and heavy-handed.For whatever reason, this movie seems to enjoy copious play on cable, bur I think it's best to just retire this over-rated suck-fest to the trash can.

I thought it was sick and found the constant emphasis on sexual humiliation kind of sad. Twenty years later I still hate it.It deals with the stupid, smutty adventures of a group of Florida teenagers in 1954. All the jokes deal with sex and are unfunny; all the teenagers are obviously in their 20s (one guy was almost 30!); the girls and guys are equally ugly; nobody can act (although Nancy Parsons has a few moments) and, by today's standards, this is kind of dull. This was considered extreme in 1981 but, for better or worse, we've gone beyond it. For some reason this was a HUGE hit and led to 2 sequels. I have nothing against sex humor, but people are constantly being humiliated in this movie--it gets uncomfortable to watch.I am giving the film a 2 because there are two very funny sequences in it--an encounter between Boyd Gaines and a very young Kim Cattrall who is very vocal and when the gym girls teacher wants a very--um--private exam of all the guys in the school. Those are funny and the film has extensive female AND male nudity! Still, that's hardly a recommendation.It's hard to believe director Bob Clark did this. He's made some great films (Murder by Decree, Black Christmas, A Christmas Story, Deathdream). Why did he do THIS?

I've seen my share of these films, most of them when I was younger and the tone appealed to me... but once you get over the age of 18, it's hard to look back and not consider them juvenile and tacky. There are a few fairly good films in the genre... the first example that springs to mind is American Pie, or my personal favorite, Road Trip. This, however, is not one of the good films... it's actually not awfully good at all. The humor is crude and pretty poor. The plot is dull and progresses so slowly, it will lull almost anyone to sleep. Anyone who doesn't laugh like crazy at the constant utterances of obscenities and references to sex, of course. The acting is mostly overplayed, as is the humor; gags and jokes are poorly set up and forced. The characters are poorly written and barely developed at all; I honestly can't tell the group of friends that make up the main characters apart. There is little to no comedic value, all the humor is based on being crude and/or seeing someone in embarrassing situations. That's not humor, that's being provocative and serving the inner jerk in the audience(ever hear of schadenfreude?). This just isn't a good film, period. Lazily made, plot barely coherent and nothing memorable neither as far as scenes nor as dialog go. One to avoid, unless you are an avid(or should I say rabid?) fan of the genre and you simply *have* to see every film of this kind. How this has risen to be one of the most popular and well-known of the genre is beyond me. 5/10 "},{"Title":"too much of a bad thing","Date":"31 August 2003","Score":"1 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  Others have already expressed my thoughts on how this alleged comedy had no humor written into it.

It's actually a pathetic imitation of the real innovator, Animal House, the movie that really got the genre started. Animal House had some of the same problems but did have good writing (Doug Kinney and Harold Ramis), good direction (John Landis), good acting and was, well, funny. Porky's makes Animal House look like The Brothers Karamazov. It's a vile pastiche, patched together from somebody's infantile memories of high school, a dumb practical joke gone bad. And boring? Isn't this the one where the kid wakes up in the morning and refers to his male member as you big husky and tries to encourage it to, uh, rise? How funny. It does have one redeeming value a sign of a significant generation gap between those raised on comedy which began (and in some ways ended) with the early greats (Lloyd, Keaton, Chaplin, Mac Sennett, Laurel and Hardy, W.C.

However, I do feel the need to warn everyone how horrible this degrading movie is. It is an indictment of human history. I think I found out why the terrorists hate us. I am actually starting to hate us too (at least those who encouraged meaningless, shallow people to produce movies like Porkys). I have resigned myself to the fact that I have to waddle through movies that are such simple minded nonsense because most movies goers want to be told what is funny and they would laugh at animal cruelty if there was sexual humiliation involved.One last story before I go When I was really depressed in my life once, I turned on the TV and this channel was showing these Porkys series back to back. I instantly felt better. I realized that no matter how bad things got in my life, at least I could say that I would neither subject another human to such mean spirited humiliation and juvenile hijinks nor lower myself to support such productions.Anyone involved in the making of this movie should be disemboweled, boiled, kicked in the face, and then spat upon.

There is hardly a sentence in this script that isn't dotted with a profane word and all anyone in the film - anyone - cares about is sex. Hey, who isn't in that it some for or another, but this is a mainline film and that's all that mattered in here. Even more ludicrous and insulting is that it's about high school-age kids (who all look about 25 years old in this film)!When you are young, stupid and devoid of morals, this is a cool movie. I thought it was 25 years ago when I first saw it, to be perfectly honest. Yes, even that classic scene in the shower room with the bulldog gym teaching pulling on this guy was funny...but not now. This film looks sophomoric to me now that it's embarrassing. I guess it depends on when in life you watch it. Anybody over 40 who still watches this needs counseling. This movie should be put in a time capsule to show how low Hollywood had plummeted by 1982. "}]
