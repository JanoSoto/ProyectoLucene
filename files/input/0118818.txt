She was one of the most talented and beautiful actresses who fitted in so well when directed by Mike Leigh.If you fond of films containing humorous British nostalgia and are fed up with the false, glitzy, Hollywood -influenced exterior that seems to be the winning trade mark these days, then this is the sort of film for you.Let's see more films about REAL life, warts and all, (like this one) for a change!

When I saw it on initial release, I liked it fine, but thought it would be memorable mainly for particular bits--the very funny scene with the obnoxious yuppie flat owner, the very powerful scenes with Mark Benton as Ricky--rather than for any coherence.  I saw it again this week and it is sticking in my mind with more impact than before; to me it now resonates as a meditation on the need to get on with one's life, and the costs (in friendship, soulfulness, caring) of doing so, and the tragedy of those who just can't make the jump. Not one of Leigh's greatest films, but like everything he's made, well worth the time.

I still think it is one of the most intelligent pieces of filmmaking I have ever seen.About 180 degrees away in its subject matter, Career Girls affects me even more strongly. The idea that a couple of college girl-chums might get together after a few odd years, is nothing new. The film  effectively puts their relationship under a microscope,  in two drastically different times of maturation, the college years, and the 10 or so years after. Under that scrutiny each will blossom, brilliantly, through the short span of the film, much like a rose blooms in time-lapse photography. It's a helluva notion. Leigh accomplishes it all brilliantly.We have all seen buddy pictures, and Career Girls is no 48 Hours, or Lethal Weapon. It's a truly sensitive look into the human soul, the human heart portraying a friendship we only imagine.This film literally leaves me breathless.

The late, great Katrin Cartlidge puts in an excellent performance.  Dreadfully sorry to learn that such a talented young stage and screen actress has died.  Lynda Steadman is also superb.The film is partly in flashback to college days in the 1980s and partly set in the present of the 1990s.  I see the exaggerated twitching and accents of the characters in the 1980s scenes as part of the flashback genre.  Perhaps I went to University with exceptionally twitchy people, or perhaps the memory pitches college-days memories at 30 frames-per-second, but my own flashbacks to such times feel a bit like that.  I thought it was intriguing cinematography, but the majority seems to be against me.Where the film does grate a little is in the coincidences that lead them to run in to their past several times.  Two of the coincidences are necessary for the plot and interest.  One seems like a coincidence too many and it goes nowhere - maybe there was an intended plot thread that got dropped - well the coincidence should also have been dropped in that case.It's a short film and it held our attention from start to finish.  Not Mike Leigh's very best film, but well worth seeing.

It's basically a character study of two neurotic women who became good friends when they lived together in college and who reunite several years after graduation. In the present day both of them are moving forward in their careers and a lot more comfortable with themselves. The movie moves back and forth in time and is quite remarkable at convincingly showing what a transformation they've made since their college days. However, while Secrets and Lies showed in great detail the painful process of moving forward emotionally, Career Girls only shows you the before and after, leaving the most interesting aspects of their characters a bit of a mystery.

Its a love story between friends much like Muriels Wedding and again without a sexual component. The two women undertake an exterior and interior journey and learn about the love that friendship quietly evolves.

Irritating actors doing irritating characters doing irritating acting.And having seen it again they're still irritating.There must come a point in Mike Leigh's much vaunted method of character improvisation where he loses objective judgement; he's so closely, and myopically, caught up in the whole process he can't see how parodic his actors charactering is becoming.There's a scene in a pub illustrates how embarrassingly bad this improvised method can get; you've got social phobic psychology student Annie (Lynda Steadman) flittering away with fidgety fingers over itchy twitchy face; sat next to her is fellow psychology student, fat Ricky, spluttering and stammering with wild flailing blind arms like somebody with jerky Aspergers; and opposite is cynical Hannah (Katrin Cartlidge) sneering with quotation mark emphasis at their pretentious psychobabble doing a mocking beaky hand thing. Tics and fidgets and jerks gone galorious &#x96; and non of it is meant to be being funny. It's not p--s-taking you're seeing, it's seriously intended role-playing. But i thought to myself this is just mimic mania gone mad; parodic mannerism has now subsided into ridiculous pantomimic absurdity. It was like witnessing Neurosis overload; these 3 hapless actors in a Mike Leigh film had just allowed themselves to be turned into grotesque caricatures, riddled with hopelessly unfunny autistic distortions of Tourettes syndrome.Oh dear. I've seen this neurotic OTT grotesquery before in Mike Leigh films; how ruinously afflicted Jane Horrocks was by it in Life is Sweet (and Timothy Spall too); Brenda Blethyn in Secrets and Lies with all her self-pitying sweed arts and darlins got pretty close to unbearable too. I suppose its par for the course. You have to expect that Mike Leigh films come with this trademark neurotic &#x96; bordering on mental illness - characterisation. Sometimes it leads towards heartfelt Pathos. And sometimes it veers off into something unbearably unbelievably Pathetic. Which unfortunately it does for big chunks of this film, especially in the retrospective flashbacks to when they were playing themselves as immature polytechnic students.In the other - friends reunite &#x96; half of the film the tics and twitches have calmed down or grown up a bit. Annie is still doing that mad eyed down turned petrified stare when stressed or confronted; Hannah has stopped doing the beaky hand thing, but the sour antipathy hasn't really sweetened any, its just found less obvious streams in which to curdle; she's professionalised her cynicism, forged a career for herself out of the energy of her anger. Ricky, however, hasn't survived &#x96; he's gone full on bonkers. One of life's sad little causalities, left to wander off on his own down the career-less path to nowhere.I suppose thinking about it i did feel a bit more in sympathy with the general premise of the film this time the whole reflecting back on how we once were, and what we now like to think we've become, how much better or improved we like to seem to ourselves, while knowing all the while &#x96; deep down &#x96; that nothing much has changed about us at all, and nothing ever will. We're more or less stuck with our silly little selves for the duration.Mind you, at least i'm not stuck inside a character in a Mike Leigh film for the duration. Lol. That would be purgatory!

I had seen it myself on a couple of occasions before, most probably on the same channel and always quite liked it. It's not my favourite but always found it better once fully immersed.Is that because I'm a bloke, who never went to Uni and never had to flat-share, but there again, the 80s and 90s were formative years for me too.Anyway, as is usual with almost Leigh films, the opening few minutes always seem to have annoying characters that we really rather not share any time with, doing their best (worst?) to put us off. However, once we get used to them and their strange, odd ways, they become part of our screen lives and as if they were people we actually know, we put up with their annoying aspects and revel in their good, Leigh's folk are very human, almost TOO much so.So, Leigh's purpose was to show how passages of time, circumstance and education, plus friendship can follow in both predictive and unpredicted ways with the reunion of two Uni classmates ten years later, with frequent, but obvious, flashbacks to the student years, we can see how people can change. Side by side, the contrasts are very marked, almost too much so, but as we usually witness our friends forming slowly, year by year, who's to say that Leigh is not right?There's a smaller pool of main characters than with the better Leighs, and as with say, the later but even less good Happy Go Lucky, there is less respite from the obnoxious and smaller variety in which to spice up the story.Oddly, considering it's the female lead characters that Leigh is championing it's the two male leads that we see regularly on TV and cinema screen these days - Mark Benton as the twitchy, overweight Goth who gets to know them in student digs but always finds solace and comfort in food instead of confronting fears, including women; these two women. And Andy Serkis, who Leigh says he made as an opposite to Benton's sweet nature as possible and in Serkis, we have a 'disgusting pig' as Leigh refers to him. Both chauvinist and arrogant he could be seen as the ultimate product of the Thatcherite Yuppie years and again, typically Leigh, he doesn't portray this subtly and quite rightly, we want to leave his company as quickly as possible but perhaps more importantly, want our 'girls' to, as well. There are lots of comedic takes on Serkis' lifestyle 'choices' and this does lighten the emotional load.The two female leads, Katrin Cartlidge and Lynda Steadman though do not seem to be gracing our screens at all right now, though Cartlidge did feature in Leigh's Topsy Turvy (1999) and previously in the excellent Naked(Leigh's best film, probably) from 1993. Steadman seemed to have been in TV dramas about then but - all according to IMDb - nothing since 2003.Maybe Mike Leigh has made too much out of political and economic markers to make us really care for any of the people here. Yes, they're engaging with their character traits and whilst we sort of feel a part of their world, albeit briefly, we don't necessarily want to be. However, there are some nice down to earth and more reflective moments, they are just a bit too far between to be make the film totally enjoyable.

After the night set, pounding bleakness of something like Naked, Career Girls is the morning after &#x96; a desire for everything to remain quiet and somewhat subdued; a film with people, more often than not, inhabiting cleaner, more cleansed locales and speaking on more grounded, humanised terms as they remember the past and laugh at things from times gone by instead of look ahead to a future of the impending disasters that are readily incoming.In some regards, the film is about the addressing of one's past; the acknowledging of what it is that made oneself in terms of one's experiences and being unafraid to confront them or indeed revisit a proverbial place in which one felt one's identity was forged. For the most part, the two female leads of Career Girls flit around a sunny London encountering people from their past and recalling them via stories and whatnot; the key difference arriving in the form of the women being able to recognise and relive certain memories and engagements, those of whom they meet and are able to speak with at length often coming across as seemingly oblivious to such interactions - a result which has them appear as disturbed or as arrogant or with any other previous negative characteristics that they always had. We sense the two women, however, have advanced from their jittery; restless natures that once imbued their lives back in the day.The two women are Hannah and Annie, respectively played by Katrin Cartlidge and Lynda Steadman; Annie the one occupying the frame when we first see either of them &#x96; a train journey down to London from the north to meet with Hannah. Hannah and Annie were university students in England's capital back in the 1980s, their demeanour back then far more different to a primmer, more proper attitude to appearance and social behaviour than is evident in the present; our entrusting that they are university students, first-year freshers maybe, hand in hand with their general incarnations which calling to mind two certain Harry Enfield characters of a teen-aged ilk. Hannah is better off in life than Annie, a well dressed woman with a company car and apartment, whereas Annie is on the verge of chucking in her job. Where accusations, they of a frivolous and false sort, of misogyny blighted criticisms of the aforementioned Naked; Leigh splits a film that is all about women, and these two women specifically, down the centre page in telling an if only occasionally interesting tale, that is light on story, but is instead a somewhat charming account of these two recalling the faces and places which had the impact that they did on these two.In the 1980s, they live a grimy existence with a third girl named Claire (Byers); a small accommodation above a Chinese takeaway shop encompassing the three of them in messy living rooms and shared bedrooms. The film chops between the two strands, either of the strands with enough in them to make decent films, shorts or otherwise, as stand alone pieces, but here somewhat uncomfortably spliced together as the nature of the chaotic and unhinged past tense clashes uneasily, indeed ineffectively juxtaposes, with the brighter and more 'grown-up' present tense strand of the two of them taking trips down memory lane. Leigh proves he can rack up a certain sense of unease; the initial coming together between the two women is, we feel, fraught with mites of tension. One instance sees a flashback to an altercation involving some mugs following one of the women's present day mentioning of them, a past instance that brings back a negative memory which ends undesirably that arrives with a good use of panic and pulsating musical tones.It's too bad the rest of the film is not up to as much as this brief excursion, during which seeds of antagonism or whatnot are alluded to; the film lacking a cutting, narcissistic edge and instead plumbing for these people generally getting along swimmingly with one another in their gliding from one place to the next, frequently recognising someone of old, but sometimes not. At one point, we observe the film open up for an extended venturing of the two from apartment to apartment as Hannah looks for somewhere new to live, something encompassing odd interactions with shady real-estate folk; but it's nothing, in fact the two girls downplay the situations &#x96; where conflict seems apparent, Leigh stays in sync with the film Career Girls is and manoeuvres us around it for laugh and frolics as they merely exiting accordingly.Where tension and a fair amount of drama is maintained, lies with the ambiguity surrounding just how much of the past either of these characters can actually recall. A great deal of 1980s content gives way to the present day stuff more inclined to lending time to these people uncovering places and people of old, which while looked back upon with nostalgia in that fashion nostalgia often brings about, what actually unfolded back in the day was often quite grotty and rough. Not for a second are we entirely sure precisely what it is either woman remembers and what they don't, and if they laugh and joke about times and people of old, how much can we invest in the past strand if the resultant drama leads them to where they are now? In spite of everything, there is an endearing quality about proceedings; it may not be particularly noteworthy, but it has a charm to it.

It makes most American films seem flabby and overly tedious.Two outstanding performances lay at the center of this story as we are taken into the lives both past and present of Hannah and Annie, college roommates reunited for a weekend. This perfectly ordinary setup is fodder for Leigh to work his magic in dissecting, this time via multiple flashbacks, how these two came to rely so heavily on one another as well as the long-term effects of their relationship as it weathers various problems, especially men.Ultimately, here Leigh has crafted a portrait of friendship and loyalty so alarmingly realistic and straightforward that it may come across as too contrived or preposterous for some. Indeed, there are several huge coincidences that must take place in order for the necessary conclusion. However, these never come across as overtly nice and neat and the end result indeed justifies everything that has come before it. Regardless of whatever they encounter, Hannah and Annie will remain as close as they can. After all, without each other who would they have and who else do they need?

However, while many of today's young movie-makers are thrown into the deep end with huge projects, Leigh honed his craft with a much cheaper alternative. He mastered the one-off play with Nuts in May and Abigail's Party, attracting a cult following, while the TV movie, Meantime, turned Gary Oldman and Tim Roth into two of the hottest British actors of their generation. By 1988, Leigh had written and directed one movie, Bleak Moments (1971), 19 plays and 11 TV films before returning to the big screen.High Hopes marked the beginning of Leigh's most successful vocation and was followed a few years later by Life is Sweet. In 1993, Leigh delivered arguably his greatest film to date. Naked was a bleak, funny tale of Johnny (David Thewlis), an intelligent Mancunian drifter who travels to London and pours vitriol onto everyone he meets. Bursting with witty dialogue, it proved to be one of the most controversial and stunning films of the Nineties which turned Thewlis into one of the most sought after actors on earth. Mike followed it up with the critical smash Secrets and Lies (1995) and the critically mauled Career Girls (1997).This was torn apart by some critics - most notably Tony Parsons on the defunct BBC2 strand Late Review - who were annoyed by the OTT character traits of its stars. Nevertheless, even a bad Leigh movie is worth a look, and this has the added bonus of starring Katrin Cartlidge from Naked.   It centres on two successful professional women who recall the youthful insecurities of their student days and how they gradually blossomed into self-assured professionals. If you can get past the constant twitching of its main stars during the first few minutes, then this is a highly absorbing drama with a likeable cast. The Mockney accent of Katrin makes her highly irritating while the overweight student, Richard Burton, tries to outdo both girls in the twitching department.Despite the character 'traits', Lynda Steadman, Mark Benton, Kate Byers and Andy Serkis are all fine while the ending is suitably bleak.Not classic Leigh, but still worth a look.

We see Hannah and Annie now refined in their older age, but, as they flashback to their flat mate days, we see two spastic girls.Annie visits Hannah in London, and, in the first flashback, Annie recalls meeting Hannah as she moves into the flat.  Hannah is mean and outspoken, and you wonder why Annie would ever want to be her friend--especially, as Hannah makes fun of Annie's eczema on her face.  But they soon become friends--sometimes it is hard to watch these women.  Annie jerks her head to the side and shakes with shyness while Hannah talks on the top of her lungs and flings her arms about.  And, if you watch carefully, both revert to these nervous behaviors as adults in certain scenes.I was waiting for the big revelation, but it was nothing, really.  Hannah and Annie run into ex roommates and boyfriends during their weekend reunion--and one ex doesn't even remember them.  Everybody their age has married and moved on.  But these girls are outcasts.  And in the end, you can see life has been unfair to them, except in their careers.This type of movie is not everybody's cup of tea, and there is some thick English accents here.  But if you want to know how to turn Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights into some sort of magic eight ball, this is the movie for you!

It's no surprise he made the ambitious, totally  atypical Topsy Tervy next. It has it's small pleasures, but look for High Hopes Grown-Ups Life Is Sweet and others for the right stuff.

But this is one. The thing with Leigh's movies is that the stories are for the biggest part just ordinary people in their ordinary everyday life. And it are the characters that almost make you feel like you are watching a documentary, that make them so special. This story is again a story with nothing much interesting. Two roommates that meet again. Half of the time in real life and the other in sort of flashbacks. But this time the acting is so very much overdone, that it is almost like I'm watching an American comedy, with just the fake laughs in the background missing. Apart from an occasional laugh, I watched it till the end as if I was sitting in the chair at my dentist. Just for old time Mike Leigh's sake.

Career girls takes place in a world so far from hollywood that its as different from it as a book is from a Play. Its hard to credit the acting in it as the people seem so incredibly real and yes it may appear dull and overly realistic for peroids but Mike Leigh never fails to hit the mark in what are usually quite short films. Sometimes the position of the  mark is up to the viewer to decide but one thing is certain is these people will have to get up tomorrow cause lifes issues cannot be solved in a 90 minute segment. their direction may be a bit clearer of if it was clear it may be more confused. if nothing else as a man in my mid thirties it made me think of some of the people that flitted in and out of my life at various time through college different jobs and so on. and yes i could relate to the Rick figure , not every one will turn out all right. every 'Bum' on the street has had a past life and many of them very different to how you now see them Life can sucks but there is always hope and there no one better than Mike leigh to show that "},{"Title":"One of the biggest disillusionments.","Date":"30 October 1998","Score":"4 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  I was touched by the humanity of SECRETS AND LIES, by its simplicity.

The plot was simple but thats the beauty of Mike Leigh's films. There's not a whole lot of action but he conveys the basic realities of life, whether happy or harsh, with such credibility and enthusiasm. He comes across as a really good director for actors to work with. He gives them the freedom to express themselves and really go for it, no matter how subtle or OTT they might be. It is refreshing to see drama like this, done with such work-rate and honesty, not the trash Hollywood produces while paying talentless actors millions for portraying characters that no one cares about. Thats the talent of Leigh and the actors he collaborates with. They create and portray characters that the viewer can relate to and care about, whether it's Lynda Steadmans' Annie longing for love while dealing with her allergies or Karin Cartlidges' Hannah and her search for happiness while dealing with her mother's alcohol problem. Mark Bentons' Ricky is beautifully tragic to watch as it displays the capabilities of this highly talented actor. Not for everyone this film, but if you appreciate great acting, wonderful story-telling and the value of true friendship, I highly recommend that you see this when the chance arises again.

I believe I stopped watching before it was all the way over. I disliked the characters, I was bored by the story and I found no chemistry between the actors at all. The two main girls were extremely annoying, and the taller one was just horribly obnoxious, especially in the college flashbacks. They seemed uncomfortable around each other, both in the present day and in the college segments. I thought they hated each other! These are best friends? Ugh. I do not recommend this film to anyone.  "},{"Title":"The great(?) Mike Leigh bores again","Date":"2 April 2000","Score":"6 out of 18 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  I haven't got a clue why this film got such good reviews, especially in the press. It's a boring, irritating film in which nothing happens. The story is ludicrous it centers around two ex-roommates/friends who meet again after six years. Their lives have changed, they've become more mature. We can see how they were years before, through a series of flash-backs.This is a film by Mike Leigh, who has been praised for making such strong character studies, in which the story is less important than the people. SECRETS AND LIES was in the same style and is maybe his best known film. Although this was also an uninteresting and cold film, it had something of a story in it. You got (in a certain way) a chance to know something about the characters. But this film is a total disaster. What did these actors for example eat were they on speed or what? why did they act this way? The Ricky-character for example is good for a few unintended laughs , but I think the director told him to say whatever words came to his mind, so that he could mumble through the film.But the true uninteresting, even irritating characters are the main ones the two girls. You never quite get to know them so you never get to care about them. The fact that they act as lunatics and talk the same way doesn't help either. It's almost impossible to understand the conversations, especially in the beginning. And what do they actually talk about? Does this have a meaning? The film is filled with such a stupid dialogue.I can't recommend this film to anyone. It's simply to dumb. And if you would choose to watch this film(and sit through it!), you got to ask yourself the question in the end why in God's name do we need such a film? I dare you to watch it and tell me, cause I simply don't know what good these 90 minutes did to my life. 3/10   "}]
