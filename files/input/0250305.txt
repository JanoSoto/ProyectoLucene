Anyhow, the movie was actually really cool and had some REALLY cool ideas.  I really liked the idea that they weren't actually stopping time, they were just slowing it down REALLY slow.The main reason I wanted to see the movie was for the special effects and I wasn't let down, the special effects were spectacular and lots of fun. As far as acting goes, I thought all the actors did a find job.  I liked Jesse Bradford, French Stewart, Michael Biehn and last but certainly not least, Paula Garces.  I was really impressed with Paula's beauty, she is a quite a beautiful woman and predict a great future for her.  I can't wait to see her next project.As far as story-line goes, I thought it was pretty darn good and rather smart.  There were a few things that I could have done without, but I can deal.  One part that really struck me as odd was when he (Jess Bradford) was in the bathroom at the hospital and he was trying to get the watch (time-stopper) to work.  While he was in the bathroom the bad guys slow down time and come walking into the hospital and suddenly you see Jesse disguised as a cop and then as soon as the baddies walk by Jesse takes off running.  I assume he got the watch to work momentarily, but that doesn't really make sense because later in the movie he gives it to French Stewart so he can repair it and get it working again.  I just think that one scene could have been explained better and it would have been quite easy to do.One little movie trivia tid-bit that I noticed in the film was when Francesca and Zak are having fun with the watch and she says Make it so Number One.  That is a reference to Star Trek The Next Generation.  Captain Picard always said that to Commander Riker (aka Number One).  This is interesting, because Clockstoppers is directed by Jonathan Frakes, who plays Commander Riker in Star Trek.I hope you enjoyed the movie as much as I did.  It's not a superb sci-fi movie, but it's fun and it's got lots of cool things to look at and some fun ideas.

The story revolves around a mysteriouswatch with the power to speed the wearer's molecules and allow him to move faster than anything around him does. Scientist Earl Dopler sent a prototype of the device to friend and college professor George Gibbs to help him perfect the device. One afternoon, the watch accidentally falls into a broken toaster where George's son Zak picks up to take with him.Zak has been trying to get a new foreign exchange student to go out with him. She finally agrees after he goes out of his way to stop some bullies from harassing her and agrees to have him come over to her house to help rake the lawn.When he activates the watch, thinking it's a stopwatch, time slows suddenly and while taking the bag of leaves to the garbage can comes across a hissing possum. He pokes it and thinks it's dead and waltzes into Francesca's house to show her what he found that was invading the trash cans and his watch suddenly ends its time and everything goes back into standard motion. The possum isn't really dead and when he tries to explain, things get out of hand.After figuring out what the watch does, Zak and friends go on the lam trying to escape the organization that's trying to get it back. They use similar watches, preventing him from using the watch as an escape mechanism.Nickelodeon films, one of the production companies behind the film, have been known for good and bad movies throughout their feature film career and have managed to stumble across both an idea and a director that works. Frakes proved his capabilities with the feature film Star Trek First Contact, a terrific film that shines among its fellow Star Trek films. Now, Frakes has branched further into the science fiction genre, stepping away from his small screen productions. He takes a potential childish and unemotional film, blends in the right amount of scientific explanation, avoids paradoxes adroitly and keeps the film excellently paced with plenty of room for enjoyment.The performances are probably the weakest part of the film. Each actor does his very best to portray the characters realistically and perhaps their relative inexperience is a factor. Bradford has numerous credits to his short career, including Hackers, but smiles far too often for his characters needs and even when he's upset or angry, the tell-tale smile is nearby. Garc√©s tries her best, but with the broken English, she feels more like a caricature than a character, but she is awfully beautiful! The same goes for the third friend, Meeker, who is around for comic relief more than for dramatic necessity.Television actors Stewart and Julia Sweeney, as Zak's mom, are capableactors in their own rights, but for Stewart, this was a step in the wrong direction as he bounces well over the top of good taste in his rather amorphous role.The true prize of the picture is its slow-down visual effects. Usingtechnology first seen in commercials to stop the action and then using a composite image to allow actors to walk freely amongst stopped figures, was a bit troublesome at first, but as the film went on the effects were better. The most notable was the frozen water droplets hanging in air while the actors interacted with them. The effect was admirably done and important only to the magnificence of the experience.Clockstoppers is most certainly made for teens, but adults will be able to sit back and enjoy the film without feeling talked down to.  I thoroughly enjoyed it!

This causes a lot of conflict between them and Zak tries to get his father to understand how he feels.  His dad looks guilty but professes that Zak is exaggerating. When he has promised to go with Zak to look at a car that is Zak's heart's desire, his dad suddenly has to go away to help an old student who is having a problem with an invention.The invention is a wrist watch that can be activated to put the wearer into hyper-time.  After the father leaves, Zak finds the watch and puts it on, thinking it is only a watch. While visiting a girl he has recently met, Zak pushes the button to check the time and voila!  Time stops.  To the viewer it appears to freeze everyone and everything else, but then you begin to notice that drops of water from the sprinkler are still falling, just falling a millimeter per second; a hummingbird suspended in mid-air is still flapping his wings, but so slowly that you can barely see the movement. However, Zak, and anyone who is touching him when he activates hyper-time is moving at what appears to be a normal speed.Zak is stunned at first but eventually realizes what has happened and, as a typical teenage boy, proceeds to have some fun with it, along with the girl he wants to impress!  Some of the tricks they pull are hysterical and lead you to imagine what you might do if you got ahold of this watch!Of course, there must be an evil plot behind this somewhere, and we soon learn what that is.  This leads to grave danger for Zak, his dad and Zak's new girlfriend and also provides for some fun car chase scenes.The movie, of course, requires you to suspend disbelief and if you aren't capable of that, skip the movie!  Otherwise you are only going to spend the hour criticizing the scientific aspects of hyper-time and annoying everyone around you who has some imagination and is having a good time.The movie is directed by Jonathan Frakes, who played Commander Riker on Star Trek, the Next Generation.  He apparently learned a lot during his STNG days and puts it to good use in this science fiction fun-fest.  Thanks Number One.  You made it so.

It has one story line and truly underdeveloped characters, besides an unbelievable plot. In addition, they never really use the watch to the full extent. In the beginning they do some interesting stunts, but the watch seems to disappear from the plot and hypertime becomes normal time since everyone seems to have a watch.Also, Paula Garces (born in 1974)is sometimes hard to imagine as a teenager. However, Jesse Bradford is the shining star who is completely believable as a teenager and the role seems to fit him. Yet, he seems bogged down by the other character and could really do a lot more challenging roles.This movie also drags on for awhile. It is fun at first, but then the plot seems to try to go to deep and be more than it is suppose to be. The child-parent-problem-relationship is truly overdone. (See how it ruined The Babysitters' Club?)Yet, I will re-emphasize how truly amazing Jesse Bradford was (definitely seeHackers and Bring It On). The reason I went to see this movie was for him, and for that it was worth my $7. Otherwise, this movie would have been a total mess. But, as I said before, you can't expect much from a PG movie aimed at pleasing children who want to be adults. For that reason, young children and most adults might get bored with this movie. It drags and has little redeeming qualities like special effects or a lot of humor. But, I assume, that is not what this movie is about.My overall opinion, is that it is cheesy but enjoyable, especially, if like me, you are a huge fan of Jesse Bradford. But do not expect too much or you will be let down. It is enjoyable if you let it be. Don't over analyze it and, most of all, don't think like an adult.

Zak, who keeps pining his father for a hot new Ford Mustang, winds up getting his hands on the watch, and, upon discovering its true powers, uses it to impress Francesca (Paula Garc√©s), the new girl at school from Venezuela. It doesn't take long for the two of them and their other friend Meeker (Garikayi Mutambirwa) to abuse the watch's power and cross paths with Gates, who desperately wants that watch back.Clockstoppers is simple entertainment; precisely the kind of medium-budget production you could envision Nickelodeon Movies putting out in the early 2000s. It takes a lot of similar vibes from Back to the Future, and it focuses on familiar teen tropes in order to momentarily capture the attention of pre-teens. It has an attractive lead actor with a rebellious swagger, a beautiful foreign exchange girl who sticks closely by his side after initially showing her claws, and the rowdy sidekick, who adds a more comedic spin on his buddy's serious perils.Throw that all in a blender and you get Clockstoppers, basic cable's best friend. A film good enough to take up a two hour time-slot with commercials, but not good enough to have any retaining or lasting value outside of basic cable entertainment. Despite both Bradford and Garc√©s boasting enough charisma to make them worthy of the two leading roles, it's largely the way the film surprisingly handles the material in an unexciting way, right down to crafting a boring villain who feels about as uninspired and as cookie-cutter as they come. For a film about stopping time and momentarily stunning and transforming the space-time continuum, it's a film with shockingly low energy.Bradford and Garc√©s do manage to be pretty charismatic screen presences throughout the film, making you wish they did more of these tween adventure films for the sake of their appealing nature. This was a time when Disney and Nickelodeon films based around brand new, live-action properties were being churned out and nearly every young, white actor was getting their shot at centerstage for whatever project the studios wanted to concoct. Clockstoppers isn't uniquely bad, which in itself is a bit of a disappointment because at least it would provide me with something noteworthy to say. Unfortunately, the film is just a simple case of fast food filmmaking, movies you can quickly watch and just as quickly forget.Starring Jesse Bradford, Paula Garc√©s, Garikayi Mutambirwa, Robin Thomas, and Michael Biehn.

When he presses a button on the watch it slows down time not actually stopping it. Moving so fast thru time, accelerating at the speed of a hummingbirds wing flapping, (google it).

(go figure the bad guys). As the teenager uses the watch, he also learns of it's side affects. When in Hypertime, the body is actually accelerating at hyperspeed as well, causing the cells of the body to age faster. 1 minute in reality is close to something like 5 or 10 minutes. 1 hour? almost something close to 2 days or more.

He's not funny and he's not particularly likable. He's just the stereotypical self involved teen. It's less flashy than Spy Kids but is still intended for a tween audience. It's stupid at times and at other times, it's a reasonable movie. There is some action and some spraying of liquid nitrogen. It's a relative mixed bag and not recommended for the older teens.

My expectations weren't very high and the story, based in Science Fiction, had the potentially of being too hard for audiences to understand. The writers decided to go another way with it and put this unique, experimental technology in the accidental hands of a teenager, and then marketed the whole package to young adults. It sounded a bit sketchy to me too and that's why it took me almost ten years to see it, but what I learned from this film, you can never judge a DVD by it's cover. Clockstoppers combines Einstein's Theory of Relativity with teenage rebellion in an action packed film that will really leave you on the edge of your seat. The story starts when a former student of Prof. George Gibbs sends him a prototype, of a watch, that speeds up your molecules to the point where it looks like everything else is standing still. Prof. Gibbs soon leaves to go on vacation when his son finds the watch and wears it out, thinking it's a normal watch. Once he learns the truth, other Clockstoppers show up to try and kill him, and that's when the film really gets going. The acting and special effects aren't really what draws you into Clockstoppers, it's the story, which throws you in every single direction and leaves you craving more. This was a film that was at the bottom of my list, that I watched because it was short and it was streaming. I was just looking for something to watch before bed, and what I found instead was a terrific Science Fiction adventure that fell way under the radar.

If a movie has heart, it's easy to like and that is the case here. In addition it's got style and is pretty cool to look at. The younger generation would particularly be drawn to it. There are some amazing special effects, very cool ideas (like the main theme itself which is about manipulating time) and plenty of humour, action and energy. While the main storyline is interesting but there are a few plot holes that needed some filling. But then again, it's not a movie that was meant to be taken too seriously. The acting is brilliant. Jesse Bradford, Paula Garc√©s, French Stewart, Michael Biehn, Robin Thomas, Garikayi Mutambirwa and Julia Sweeney are very good. Garc√©s looks supercute. She and Bradford (who is always dependable where good acting is concerned) make a nice couple. It would be fun to see them pair up again.

A kid, unlike you or I, finds a watch from his super-genius father that can literally slow down time (actually, speed up his molecules so that time seems to be going slower). Instead of stay in that time forever, growing old and experiencing the powers of invisibility, he uses it to win over the heart of an unknown girl and stop the world from catapulting into utter annihilation. Yep, something I would do if I could stop time. Like any other film of this nature, I am sure you know what ultimately happens in the end. Helmed by Star Trek's very own Jonathan Frakes, Clockstoppers boasts the talents of Jesse Bradford, Michael Biehn, and French Stewart &#150; with a cast like this, who needs enemies. Using amazing CGI to bring this story from the page, where Frakes falls short are the characters and his inability to grapple with the technology he is filming. I am not going to cover my issues with the molecular speed-up, because I am sure they have been nauseatingly been said before, but they did force you to consider the unmentioned possibilities. Why wasn't this whole film done with slowed time? How could some inanimate objects fly through the air in slow time, while others fit into the pattern of going slow? Why didn't Bradford fall through the floor? Age issues &#150; don't make me go there! Again, this could be a whole topic of conversation, but instead, lets talk about the other pivotal downfalls of this film, and how they related to me feeling decent after watching this.I must admit, Frakes does a decent job behind the camera. He has learned from his acting lessons and can tell a complete story. Without the science fiction plot holes, the story itself for Clockstoppers was pretty clich√©, yet straight forward. He didn't try to overdo it, while his actors might have attempted to gobble every line they could, Frakes kept the story simple and the CGI impressive. I have to applaud him for his work here, he could have made this a very dark story, but instead kept it suitable for a teen audience. This wasn't the original Agent Cody Banks in any way, but it did attempt to stand on its own, and I must applaud Frakes for his attempt. The acting, as mentioned before, was horrid. French Stewart was possibly at the lowest point of his career with this film. His attempt to be a honest scientist was goofy at best. He was never mad, just loony with his approach to this character. Jesse Bradford was middle of the road. Consistent with the standards of this film, he never went above where we wanted him to be. Oddly, his Ebay selling reminded me of another character from Transformers, but I don't want to think the two films plagiarized. Julia Sweeny, well, just don't make me go down that tunnel. Paula Garces was middle of the road as well, she played off Bradford with ease because there was nothing they needed to attach themselves to. Could I be any more vague? When I finished watching this movie, I wasn't feeling upset or happy about the results &#150; this was a mediocre film, and I can applaud it for staying within that genre.Sometimes I listen to music half my age &#150; this film is a prime example of music that is half my age. There was an attempt to take it even further up the tween channel by employing the music of Blink 182 to heavily dominate the scenes of joy, empowerment, or victory. There was the overuse of Smash Mouth, which seems to plague every tween movie today &#150; but oddly, that was allowed this time. Typically, I find myself yelling about how one-sided these releases tend to be. Focusing their marking towards a singular audience instead of just pushing the boundaries, but with Clockstoppers I felt their average outing calmed me. It worked I shouldn't have worked, but it did. Frakes subdued me, and I cannot argue with him. The special features surrounding this film were pathetic as well, staged behind the scenes which only showed how fun a film like this could be &#150; it was disgusting. The music videos didn't fit, and the Saturday Morning interruptions also included were vile as well. See this language, yet I am going to give this film at least three stars. See, Frakes did dupe me.Overall, I gotta stop this review before I stick myself in a deeper hole. Agents with no names, bad villains bent on total domination using everything in their arsenal outside of the weapon of choice, a cool watch that may have sold well over the holidays, and plot holes the size of Miami. I hate these features on a film, but again, Clockstoppers filled a hour and a half of couch time well for me. I never laughed, but I never got bored with this story. Call me a quitter or a lackey to the cause, but Clockstoppers never came out of its shell, and I am happy for that. It was pathetic, but delightful in the same sense. I cannot suggest this movie to friends, but if it rained one afternoon and we needed something to kill the time &#150; I think Clockstoppers would find its way back to the DVD player! Thank you Frakes &#150; you duped me again!

With this in mind, I always have to check my logical thought at the door for most science fiction regardless of how close the writers are to existing theory or application. The thing to keep in mind with Clockstoppers is that it's a bit like a live-action cartoon - as most light-hearted scifi is. Regardless of the hefty amount of cliche and cartoon physics, Clockstoppers is an enjoyable spin on an old science fiction concept. There are no pretentious Speilbergian  epiphanies or insights on a grand quantum design - just some simple adventurous fun, enjoyably above par special effects and several genuinely funny moments. Even the few spotty-acting moments are passable. I'm not usually one to go for cute movies, but Clockstoppers has me.

For example, if you were moving so fast, than how come (I think) a television set isn't moving as fast as him? (It would be constantly remaking the image, not showing it just as slow as everything around him.) Also, if the watch allows anything touching him to go into hypertime as well, and he's touching the ground, than how come everything doesn't go into hypertime minus the airplanes in the air? And, a car going at over 200 mph has everything outside of it looking like it's standing still? You'd have to go 186,000 miles per second for that to happen.But that's not the point of the film.

The complex plots and the CGI are just 2 great reasons to stay tuned to them. One of the latest and greatest sci-fi films to come along is I, Robot. With its intriguing plot and its amazing CGI, there's no way you can't love this film. However back in 2002, Clockstoppers came along. Unfortunately, Clockstoppers is a severely missed opportunity for a great sci-fi film. The creators had to keep it appropriate for a PG rating in the U.S so the kids would get a loving sci-fi film that they could actually enjoy. They had to tone down the possibly great plot and turned down all content away from making any movie good. It's too bad really.Zack Gibbs (Jesse Bradford) is a busy high school kid as he desperately sells everything he can find for a quick buck. The guy is saving his money for a car. While looking in the basement where his father (Robin Thomas) works, he finds a cool wristwatch. However his father is a top-secret scientist who works for an evil corporation. Back to his daily routine, him and his best friend, Meeker (Garikayi Mutambirwa), are at the paintball shop where he works and they meet a new Spanish girl named Francesca (Paula Garc√©s; yeah I know a lot of no-names). Zack hits on her and volunteers to go to her house to do chores so he can get to know her better. During the chores, Zack accidentally toggles his watch and it freezes all of time as everything and everybody have come to a stop. Zack has discovered how to use the device as the special time is called Hypertime. But when Zack realizes he wasn't supposed to take the watch from his dad, agents fro the corporation come after him. Now him, Francesca, and Meeker have to escape the evil bad guys.French Stewart probably is one of the main reasons to look forward to this film. He's a great comedian and he does a nice job on-screen as Earl Dopler, a scientist who works for the same corporation as Dr. Gibbs. The head of the evil corporation is Henry Gates (Michael Biehn; GATES! Microsoft should sue!) as he hardly is a good villain.The opening sequence is probably one of the best scenes in the movie. If they had driven the film with the caliber from the first scene, it would have been more enjoyable.Analysis time. First off, if this film was PG-13, they could have accomplished so much more. If they had forgotten the kid content, it would have been a worthy sci-fi film of mention. Just think can you imagine what kind of power you could have if you had that kind of watch on hand? You could do so many things not demonstrated in a PG film. Instead, the film shows what could happen if this were in the hands of a desperate teenager. This is particularly noted in one scene when they pull minor pranks on the town. Oh, big man now! If French Stewart would have had more screen time, he could have made the film more enjoyable and he'd seem more in place if this were PG-13. All the characters talk as if they don't know English. The action violence is revolved around a lot of biking or running and the running concept only worked for Minority Report. Honestly put, Clockstoppers is a major miss for the sci-fi genre.Overall, Clockstoppers is a good family sci-fi film. If you pause and take 10 minutes to realize that this film is PG, you might enjoy it more. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this film but it was lacking from my particular audience. I definitely would enjoy this film if I was much younger but how can that satisfy everyone? If someone can take this concept and put it in a PG-13 context, I'll be willing to pay $5 for the move ticket.My Rating 5.5/10 (A Mid 5.5)Eliason A.

I kept saying to myself every time I saw a commercial, God that movie looks like a pile of crap. When my dad got the DVD, I watched it, just to see if it was as bad as I thought it would be. I was very wrong after the film ended. I expected to see the typical Nickelodeon movie, bad acting, terrible writing, and no story. What I got was a very entertaining, and visually stunning movie. Sure, it attempts to be funny, but fails horribly, but I factored in the fact that this was a kids movie, so naturally, children would find this movie funny. Jonathan Frakes also proves to be a very good director when working on something other than Star Trek. The acting wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, but it still wasn't very good. The story actually impressed me, because it actually had some complexity applied to it. The story is also very creative, and clever. Like I said earlier, this movie is VISUALLY stunning, and I have a few reasons. The main part of the story, was that a teenager finds a watch that can stop time, so, if jumps in a puddle of water while the watch is active, the water will just stay in the air. So my point is that whenever CG effects is involved with water, it looks good. Overall, I would strongly recommend Clockstoppers to adults, and children. 9 ¬Ω out of 10.

When I saw it on Joost, I decided to finally watch it. It's younger than I expected, but overall I had a good time with it. There are a couple of things that bothered me about it, though, and here they are, hence the spoiler warning.I love science fiction and love taking an implausible idea like this and making a set of rules about it. The filmmakers had well-defined rules, I thought, about how the watch worked. And then they promptly broke them in one completely unnecessary scene. The scene I'm talking about is the DJ scene, where the kids move the DJs and make them dance. Now, according to the rules set up, the watch doesn't make the people invisible, it makes them go really fast. So if you sit there and hold a pose for what would be one second in normal time, people would be able to see you. Yet they operate the DJ's invisibly as if they were puppets (also way too fast, if they were really moving them at the speed that they were then their dance moves would be a blur); that scene had the feel to me that someone who didn't write the original screenplay decided to add to get some extra human element into the film, because everything else was so well thought out. The second thing that bothered me initially was the car chase in hypertime, but they did explain that the cars were in hypertime (and since it's a molecular level phenomenon that did end up fitting into the rules set by the filmmakers.) In spite of this, though, I do recommend it and give it a 5 out of 10 rating. Between that one scene, and kind of a lame attempt at creating family tension between the father and son, it only gets 5.

One of my favorites (along with about a billion others) is 'Back To The Future.' As soon as I started watching 'Clockstoppers'  I felt that it had a 'Back To The Future' feel to it. Watching the extras on the DVD, those in the movie thought so too. However there is no comparison. This movie uses a group of B-grade actors and a great, novel concept of certain persons becoming able to greatly speed up their time, rendering the world and people around comparatively in extremely slow motion. The problem starts right after that great concept is introduced, as the writer and director were not able to develop any substantial story line to go along with it. The result is a cute, mostly fun little movie that uses the hyper time mode for silly things, and when it is all over we realize the hyper time concept was the entire movie, with a silly script strapped on to make it look like a movie. I was highly entertained by the hyper time concept, I was mostly bored with the story surrounding it.SPOILERS -- We get the first glimpse that something is askew when a highly disguised Dr Doppler (great name!) is trying to get quickly onto a plane for Central America, only to get invisibly jerked off the tarmac platform right before boarding. Later we figure out that it was the two bad guys operating in hyper time, moving so fast they couldn't be seen. A professor had invented the circuitry, disguised as a watch, the government was realizing the hazard of this getting into enemy hands and not wanting to terminate the project, the bad guys need Dr Doppler to finish the design, because as it stood everyone operating in hyper time ages very rapidly, which defeats part of the purpose.  The professor's son accidently gets the watch, figures out how to use it, helps his friend win a DJ contest, foils a bike theft, gets back at an over-eager meter maid, and various silly uses for such a fabulous technology.

Older audiences will clearly stress over this movie on how cheesy it is and how it violates laws of physics and with many other flaws.This doesn't give away anything so I'll just tell you this one pointless scene where Zak's friend Meeker enters this DJ contest where he does horribly and Zak and Francesca decides to use the watch to go into hypertime to control Meeker's movements. Everyone at the dance club thinks Meeker is dancing on his own because Zak and Meeker are invisible because supposably they're going really fast. Now if they're going really fast in hypertime how is it that they don't end up making Meeker dance when the DJ competition is already over? Or if they are keeping up with reality but going a little faster, then they shouldn't be invisible! Flawed? Don't be surprised. And the DJ competition scene was too long with lame moves by both competitors, you can totally tell the actors weren't scratching the records at all.When Zak was at Francesca's house gathering leafs and enables the hyperwatch for the first time, he thought he's been outside for awhile and after disabling it and being back to reality, for Francesca she thought he was only out for a couple of seconds. Now does the watch stop time or move faster then everybody?! The maker needs to makeup his mind! They just had to make things confusing with flaws with making it we're moving faster then reality instead of we stopped time even though the plot says a machine that enables them to make time stand STILL and the title of this movie referring to Clock'STOP'pers. Also the tagline pointing out FREEZE the time also referring to stopping. This movie is very flawed. No wonder a kiddy television program like Nickelodeon supported this movie. They probably thought what a brilliant idea it is without realizing it makes no sense.Another flawed scene where everyone becomes in hypertime, Zak turns on his own hypertime watch that enables him to go double hypertime or whatever but the people in single hypertime sees him go really fast but can STILL see him. Why isn't it the same with reality and single hypertime? So many hard to believe acts happening without giving us any reasonable idea that it's possible, it just seems like they had no script and made stuff along the way.When Zak met Francesca for the first time she seemed really cold to him but after Zak shows her what special ability the watch has, she starts giving him hugs and kisses? And later on even though Zak sounding like a lunatic running away from the cops she helps him with some new clothes and a beamer to get away? C'mon! If the hypertime isn't realistic enough, what is up with the relationship between them?Obviously they had to hire gorgeous Paula Garc√©s with such scenes where she's about to get undress or just in a rapped around towel to cover up the flaws and lameness of this movie and along with visual effects and a car chasing scene.I think the director Jonathan Frakes from Star Trek was out in space too long!

I gotta admit that I enjoyed watching Clockstoppers even though I'm 19 years old and this movie clearly is aimed at a younger audience. The whole idea behind the concept of Clockstoppers might be kinda dumb and for some situations it doesn't work at all (e.g. the disco scene which even if you take the idea of people moving a thousand times faster than everyone else for granted is entirely impossible. Watch the movie, you'll know what I mean) but it sure is fun to watch if you can check your logical thinking at the door.The only thing that really bothered me was the never ending rant about ebay. Damn, I don't even want to know how big a sum they had to spend in order to get mentioned that often in the progress of the movie. C'mon guys please give me a break. But oh well kids are said to be easy to manipulate so I guess the commercials just *had* to be put in between somewhere.As for me I would watch Clockstoppers again even though it's highly flawed and contains plot holes bigger than America.

It offers a clever gimmick, cool special effects, teenage heroes, puppy-love romance, a blaring rock soundtrack and even a mildly dysfunctional father/son relationship to help give the film its requisite patina of `social relevance.'  Adults, on the other hand - for all the reasons listed above - may well wish they could `hypertime' themselves through most of this tale about a crazy watch that has the power to stop time dead in its tracks.For a concept like this to really work (as it did in, say, `Back to the Future'), it has to be developed using a great deal of ingenuity and creativity.  That is definitely not the case here.  Indeed, the writers, once having come up with the gimmick, seem to have no idea what on earth to do with it for the hour and a half that the film is required to run.  Predictably, when the youngsters discover the extraordinary power of the object in their possession, they spend most of their time using it to play dumb practical jokes on the unsuspecting citizens living in their obviously studio back lot town.  Then, when the novelty of that wears off, the filmmakers trap them in a tedious plot involving stereotypical rule-the-world villains and kidnappers who are bent on retrieving the watch even if it means liquidating all the main characters in the process.`Clockstoppers' works well enough for prepubescent audiences primarily because both the violence and the lovemaking are kept on a purely prophylactic level (there's also no bad language in the movie).  I suppose I must applaud the moviemakers for that.  Yet, the film, just as assuredly, offers little that will interest anyone over the age of 15.  "},{"Title":"Just doesn't work.

It's like a wad of bubble gum; the longer you stretch it out, the thinner and weaker it becomes. The much-recycled storyline about the accidental discovery of a special gadget and the heroes who have to keep it out of the hands of the villains who want it for their evil purposes can only be stretched so far.Somewhere, amidst the jumble of special effects, cliches, blatant absurdities and ethnic stereotypes, a comprehensible, logical plot got lost in the process. Despite the fact that this film is aimed at the young crowd, the plot of Clockstoppers will fly over kids' heads while leaving the older audience in the dark. Without the visual effects, this would probably wind up in the same ignominious 2002 class of awful films alongside Resident Evil and Death to Smoochy.Clockstoppers insults its audience, both young and old, with a cliche-loaded script. Zak Gibbs (a miscast Jesse Bradford, who, at age 23, is too old to be portraying a high school student) is your average suburbanite who can't get enough of performing bike tricks, strumming a flying-V guitar and butting heads with his scientist father/college professor, George (played by Robin Thomas, while Julia Sweeney portrays Zak's mother). As he takes out the trash one day, he stumbles across a magical watch that George had been working on after it was accidentally knocked into a garbage can, and soon discovers that it can send its wearer into hypertime, meaning time and space around him suddenly freeze. It turns out that Zak is actually moving super-fast through time while his surroundings appear to be moving ver-r-r-y slowly, in the vein of Einstein's theory of relativity. Or something like that. (Never mind that Zak would be rapidly burned to a crisp like cheap bacon due to the resulting friction, but since it's a kiddie flick, we can't be bothered with such minute technicalities.)Once Zak gets hold of the watch, there are the obligatory scenes of he and his buddies testing it out in mischievous ways, including getting revenge on a crotchety meter maid in a most unpleasant way.Soon enough, we're introduced to the bad guy, Gates (Michael Biehn), who wants the watch for his own evil deeds, which are never really made clear. Now it's up to Zak and his friends, Francesca (Paula Garces) and Meeker (Garikayi Mutambirwa), to keep the watch out of his hands. Add to this already languid plot a kidnapping scene, the ridiculous usage of paintball guns to fire liquid nitrogen, and a confusing subplot regarding another scientist, Dr. Doppler (French Stewart), and it all adds up to a big headache.Once again, here we have another annoying case of the kid clashing with the well-meaning parents. It's about time someone realized this schtick is about as appealing as a pile of used Pampers. This time it's simply because Zak keeps hedging George to buy him a new car, but George keeps sitting on it due to a project he's working on. Zak complains that he's always too busy with his work. Hey, bucko, he's working in order to put food on the table and to satisfy your selfish desires.One of the worst parts of the film occurs at a DJ contest, where Meeker is an unadulterated embarrassment. (The record scratching is pretty lousy as well. Watch much better DJ-contest scenes in the 1992 Tupac Shakur movie Juice. Now, back to our review already in progress.) Zak and Francesca use the watch to, naturally, help Meeker win the contest. Big surprise. Zak and Francesca move Meeker around in hypertime, including having him do a handstand on the turntable with one hand, which he uses to spin his records. Nobody in the audience is fazed whatsoever by such an outright violation of the laws of physics.It's hard to fathom ethnic stereotypes playing a formidable part in a children's movie (amidst shameless product placements for Pepsi and Nikon cameras), yet it certainly does here. Francesca is very cold towards Zak right up until she discovers the powers of his watch. She's essentially nothing more than a gold-digger, always a positive image of Latino women. Meeker is the customary jive-talking, loud color-wearing Black kid, because all Black kids talk that way nowadays and still dress like TLC circa 1991. Two Caucasian boys, who serve as our heroes' temporary enemies until the main baddie comes along, are given the white trash treatment with dreadlocks, grunge outfits and facial piercings. (One of these guys has his nose ring affixed to the spokes of his bike as Zak experiments with the watch.) And, when Zak comes across two of Gates' agents who have broken into his house, one of them is an Asian woman who proceeds to madly karate chop and kick the air before attacking our heroes. It's somewhat disturbing, considering that kids are a very impressionable bunch.Yes, the term became cliche eons ago, but Clockstoppers winds up falling way short of its potential and proves to be a disappointment. I genuinely wanted it to be a slam dunk, but it instead throws up an airball. Don't get me wrong, I didn't hate it in the least, but at the same time this serves as a sobering reminder that special effects alone cannot carry a movie, no matter how dazzling they are. If you're in desperate need of a time-travel fix, stick with the original Back to The Future while dodging its inferior sequels. 6/10  "}{"Title":"Oh, come on.","Date":"19 August 2003","Score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":"  Yeah, okay.  So the movie was pretty bad.  But you have to look at it as what it is supposed to be.  A fun movie for kids.  No one expected it to be the next Gone with The Wind.  And you're an idiot if you did. I love this movie because of Jesse Bradford, my neice loves this movie for everything in it.  And I think that it's great for its moments of comedy, yes, they are few and far between.  And of course Jesse's face does not hurt. If I have to watch a movie while I babysit, this is the one that I pull out. I'd much rather pick it than Bob the Builder or any other crap.

The cast is horrible, specially French Stewart and the 28 years old Paula Garc√©s who plays a teenager! The leader actor Jesse Bradford is grey and he is not funny. I can't understand to the writers. do they have any brain? No they don't. They know to Albert Einstein but they don't know the Mechanics. How can you drive a car in the hypertime without problems? you are in and out the hypertime and there's no problem with your bones? OK, it's a movie made for the kids but only if they are five months old or less. "}]
