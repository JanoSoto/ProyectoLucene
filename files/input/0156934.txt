[{"Title":"Drama, Romance, a little Sex, a little Action  Good Acting; Saw Twice.","Date":"29 July 2005","Score":"54 out of 62 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery, Romance","Review":" True, there are some goofs, for the one who wants to find them. They're not important, though.The primary feature of this film is watching veteran expert actors do their craft. Kristin Scott Thomas is beautiful and plays well the part of a strong woman, but one who has been hurt. Same for Harrison Ford, who, for the ladies, is just as beau as Kristin is belle for us guys.Their hurt at the hands of their adulterous spouses brings them together in an awkward manner, but one in which they find support in each other. How they evoke their hurt feelings and their humanity within on th screen is why these are such sought performers. The viewer cannot help but feel what they feel, nor can one help wanting to cheer them when they're together.Yes, there are several action scenes involving angry corrupt cops, but they only spice it up a little, and are not a significant part of the movie.For the lover of music, Dave Grusin provides a superb Jazz based background, featuring trumpeter Terrence Blanchard. Like the actors, Grusin shows why he is one of the most sought musical consultants in the movie business. Blanchard shows why he's one the premiere trumpeters on the scene.Not a movie for the lovers of guts, blood, and gore. But for those who want to see a lot of what makes us feel inside, watch a beautiful English actress with big expressive blue eyes who can act, like Harrison Ford, to the endless soothing accompaniment courtesy of Dave Grusin and Terrence Blanchard, this is a move to watch with someone you love. Preferably in bed.I thought it deserved at least an 8.

But I also enjoyed the way the storyline developed and thought the casting was well done. I don't know whether I buy into Kristin Scott Thomas as a Congresswoman but she is a fine actress and a beautiful woman. I took notice of her in the first Mission Impossible. Although her part was small she stuck out on the screen.Here her and Ford play people whose spouses are killed in an airplane crash. They are seated together and this is where the plot takes off. Apparently Ford, a police detective in Wash D.C., discovers that his wife was having an affair. He further discovers that the affair was with the husband of a New England Congresswoman.The story takes on many subplots as Ford and Thomas find themselves drawn together by revelations of their marriages, the uncovering of deceipt, and the pure grief and anger over the loss of a loved one.I think the movie is worthwhile either renting or catching on cable.

Drawn together by both circumstance and grief, the two begin a tentative love affair despite the many complications it sets up.The actors do their best given the stark limitations of portraying two people overcome with despair, but the audience is nevertheless subjected to more than two hours of unrelieved gloominess.  In a sense, it is a bit of a relief to see a romantic film that is not all lightheartedness and carefree silliness, but a subject as profound as the study of grief and loss on the human psyche demands a less conventional, more imaginative and serious a format than this film provides.  (The brilliant film, Fearless, from 1993 is a startling case in point).  The actions of the characters often ring false as when, for instance, the two grieving spouses, sitting in a car, suddenly begin grappling in a wild sexual frenzy, a moment that elicits giggles from the audience because it is so lacking in motivation and preparation.  Moreover, the film pads out its narrative by constantly cutting away to an irrelevant and wholly underdeveloped subplot involving Ford's pursuit of a murderous cop - a sideshow that results in a completely ludicrous shooting scene that undercuts the seriousness of the film's purpose.Random Hearts is an obvious and, perhaps, even admirable attempt to bring a more mature, adult-oriented love story to the screen.  It's a shame, then, that all involved seem to have confused dreariness with profundity and gloominess with depth.

Criticized for the implausibility of a) the premise and b) the pairing of an IA cop and a Congresswoman, as well as for its slowness, the film felt just fine to me , and even ended up being surprisingly absorbing. I found my interest engaged as the film cut back and forth between Ford's and Thomas's lives as they first found out about, and dealt in very different ways in very different environments with, their spouses' deaths and the subsequent revelation that they were involved with other people. It could happen; two people's philandering spouses could be on the same plane, the plane could go down, the survivors could be brought together by the aftermath. So what if it's improbable? Improbable is not the same as far-fetched. So..what if it did happen? Why not speculate? Ford's and Thomas's performances are believable and nuanced. Instead of finding their coupling implausible (opposite sides of the tracks--give me a break) I felt it driven by a grief and betrayal neither party knew how to deal with. The script does not bring them together too soon or too easily, and the end of the film does not resolve their relationship conventionally, either. Where I find it unsatisfying is when the dialogue brings up interesting wrinkles in or insights into the ramifications of the situation, personal and professional, but never seems to pursue any of them very far. And if you make the mistake of thinking about it too hard, Harrison Ford does seem about 10 years too old for the part.For five and a half bucks at Wal-Mart, with full length director commentary and behind-the-scenes featurette, the DVD is well worth owning. I don't think I would pay $20 for it on a bet, but my wife might. OK, ten...

So it's difficult for me to be objective completely with respect to one of her films.However, I did enjoy this movie and its story, per se, more than that indicated by the average ranking among the many persons previously commenting on this site.Harrison Ford is not one of the actors, though, whose performances I enjoy most. But he's one of a handful who have reached the level of moving from 7 figures to 8 per film, so who am I to argue?Ford though is often droll in his acting style, and sometimes seems to be in serious need of an antacid and a shot of caffeine - and Random Hearts is in this grouping.His obsession in probing the losses, which both he and Thomas have endured with regard to their linked spouses, is understandable, given his profession as a detective - but not to the level presented here. Although not far, it crossed the line into the annoying category. However, most of the scenes after he and Thomas became involved were interesting and well-played.This film could have been a 9*, but I'd lower it a couple of levels, based upon Ford's overall performance, and and another, because it contained a bit more of the extraneous sub-plot elements than seemed required.

Apparently, Ford was embarrassed, as well, because he didn't seem to be acting, but rather, walking around half-asleep.They say Seinfeld was a show about nothing.  Well, this was a movie about nothing.  While Seinfeld was able to create nine fun-filled years based on nothing, this movie created nothing out of a number of solid possibilities.  Seeds of plot were strewn around, but nothing was allowed to grow.  The plotlines were undeveloped.  The characters were undeveloped.  And with all of that nothing happening, the creators still found plenty of room for filler.  I was amazed.  (The Producers would have created a successful flop in Springtime for Hitler if they'd only taken lessons from the creators of this waste of film.)The high point of the film, for me, was seeing that Kristen Scott Thomas has a pretty smile and lovely eyes.  The only other movie I've seen her in was Die Hard with a Vengeance, in which she played her part as the savage bitch to the hilt.  In the former role she was excellent, so much that I felt anger and hatred at watching her character.  In this movie she appeared to do the best she could under the circumstances.The creators seemed to be attempting to romanticize adultery, making it the norm, and suggesting that those who remain faithful to their spouses must lead boring lives.  With that attitude they created a shaky relationship between the two main characters, one that gave the audience no reason whatsoever to care about it.  Certainly the movie was faithful to its title, but WHO CARES?  Precisely!

But Random Hearts is like a glossy, stillborn mess that just sort of sits there and waits for you to decide when to turn the channel. Normally the late Sydney Pollack brought a lot more to his films, but here he must have thought star power could be enough. The story is implausible at best, and maybe just a step ahead of ludicrous. Tough Internal Affairs cop and female congressman from New Hampshire lose their spouses in a plane crash. The congresswoman wants to forget the whole thing and move on, but the inquisitive nature of the cop keeps him searching for answers. Finally, after the viewer has long since lost interest in the movie, the two begin an affair as hard to believe as Ted Danson and Whoopie Goldberg. There is WAY too much time dedicated to a subplot involving crooked cops, and this whole angle should have been written out. The whole thing plays out very, very slowly.The acting is good enough, and it is the film's only saving grace. Ford is dour and reserved as the grizzled cop. Thomas is believable and even likable as the politician whose biggest care seems to be if she should run for office again or not. She seems at peace instantly when she learns of her husband's death. The thought of these two having an affair together just isn't plausible, though. No way. It would be easier to take if the film didn't waste so much time with its subplots and parsed dialog. Pollack tries to use similar music to what he used in The Firm to liven things up, but this only makes us recall how much better that film was. And it was far from great. But that is the subject of another review perhaps some day.Was there a good way to tell such a contrived story? Not sure, but this film is a failure. In many ways, it began the downfall of Harrison Ford who has seen his career sag in recent years. Even though it was no classic, the last Indiana Jones film was the best work he's done in years. Random Hearts is essentially a waste of a good cast, director, and over two hours of your time. 4 of 10 stars.The Hound. "},{"Title":"She's through with him! He's through with her!

I saw this movie for the first time just a few months ago, but decided to review it AFTER I'd read the book. Couldn't believe some of the differences. Yes, the cheating wife was in the fashion business, and yes the cheating husband was a lawyer, but in the book the cheated husband is not an IA Cop, he's an assistant to a congressman, and the cheated wife is not a congresswoman, but a housewife with a small child, a boy!! I'm not sure why the whole side story of him being a cop and the whole story that went with it was added. I watched the movie a second time, and pretty much FF'd thru the whole police thing. The whole trip to Miami was nowhere in the book, nor was there a sister to Kay. Also in the book, there was more detail on Peyton's family background being all Italians and hating Dutch (his name is Edward in the book) for taking Peyton (Lily in the book) away from the family and not being Catholic. I really think the movie could've been more interesting to a lot of the reviewers had they used more of the book material. Also missing in the movie was Peyton's AND Kay's pregnancies. Even so, I enjoyed the movie. I think Harrison Ford is excellent, but thinking back, to have him an expectant father would not work at his age (the characters are younger in the book). Finally, I was looking forward to clarification of the steamy, albeit a little awkward, scene in the car between Kay and Dutch, but that too is nowhere in the book. I was almost disappointed reading when and how they first hook up as it wasn't nearly as exciting as the movie version. I'd still recommend this as a decent movie. Have to admit Harrison Ford was the main attraction for me. But I'd also recommend the book as a supplement to the story.

I can understand why most American moviegoers would not like it, as it is very nearly unique. The only movie I've seen that it might be likened to is Brief Encounter (the original English version with Trevor Howard, please), but this film is more subtle and interesting than the English classic.Random hearts is a story about two people, a man and a woman, whom the fates have mockingly drawn together for no better reason than their shared nightmare of betrayal, yet as it turns out their very different personalities perfectly complement each other in their efforts to cope and to find the antidote to their poisoned lives - which turns out to be perfect honesty with respect to each other, and integrity with respect to themselves.The movie itself is as honest and integral as its protagonists learn to be. Contrary to what some have said, the plot is both plausible and realistic, and all the little opportunities for over-dramatization that most American directors and actors cannot resist, are studiously avoided. And since the protagonists are intelligent but not particularly articulate, still less self-aware (which is what the movie is about), meanings and dramatic passages are mostly conveyed visually, and by first rate acting and direction, rather than editorially, via the script. Overall, the tone is one of somber realism, which creates the ideal backdrop for the subtly dramatic re-emergence of the underlying humanity and vitality of the characters, in the wake of their mutual trauma.I believe my characterization of this movie makes it fairly self-evident why so many Hollywood-conditioned viewers find this movie flat, boring, and unsatisfying, and I suppose that they also feel cheated because this is not a typical Harrison Ford movie, any more than Bridges of Madison County is a typical Clint Eastwood movie. Yet both of these films are among the best that either actor has ever done.Many seem to see the casting of Kristin Scott Thomas opposite Ford as bizarre, but I see it as brilliant. A principal theme of this movie is to probe for the common humanity that often underlies superficial differences of background, personality, and presentation, and to remind us of what is truly important in our character and our relationships.

As a result you get a romantic film both tender and expressive in their faces. Good thing that Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas have faces that the camera loves.They are the most unlikeliest of lovers. The only other way that these two would meet is if Washington, DC cop Ford was ever assigned to a security detail Representative Thomas. Unlikely as Ford's assignment is Internal Affairs. But somewhere their spouses Susanna Thompson and Peter Coyote did meet. In fact they've been meeting regularly for some time now.It all comes to light when the two are killed in a plane crash that goes down in the Potomac River. As one of them is traveling under an assumed name and the other lied about her destination it does take someone with the mind of an investigator to track it down. Depending on your point of view of how fortunate for Ford that he is one.Both Ford and Thomas are dealing with other issues. Ford and his partner Charles Dutton have just busted Dennis Haysbert, a cop who was shaking down social club operators for protection money. In fact in a very interesting hostage scene Ford puts Haysbert in custody. You have to see the film alone for how he handles that.As for Thomas she's facing a multi-millionaire opponent for her seat which is one of the two in New Hampshire. Not really a good time for dirty laundry to be aired. We never see her opponent, but he's one of those family values types so we know exactly what she can expect.Still these two become a comfort to each other and soon enough become quite a bit more. How their worlds eventually publicly intersect is for you to see Random Hearts.In a modern urban setting Random Hearts is a love story, the kind that Hollywood used to do so well. Bid kudos to Sydney Pollack and his stars and cast for delivering on this one.

This is an amazingly dull movie.I have admired much of Pollack's work (and he is an engaging character actor whose performance in Tootsie was both pleasing and funny), but Random Hearts is easily one of the dullest pieces of film making I've ever dozed through. There is quite simply nothing to hold your interest, not even a lame side story of Harrison Ford trying to prosecute a corrupt cop. There's no intellectual or sexual tension, no intense interest in finding out the details of the spouses' relationship, and I defy you to care whether or not Ford and Thomas get past their grieving to become a couple.It's all so forced and TVish that I'm not sure why I stuck with it to the ending credits.This is the sort of expensive, glossy junk that talented actors and directors sometimes put out there to suck us in and make for themselves some quick cash.I think it would have been more merciful if the film stock had crashed in the Potomac with the cheating spouses.

Random Hearts is one of very few films shot entirely in the Washington DC area, and I like to revisit for historic reasons.The film unfolds slowly and runs for more than 2 hours &#x96; a tough sell in an age of 10-second attention spans. But the plot is more complex than it seems. There is a large cast of sleazy, disgusting people. I got much more from a third viewing; significantly turning up the volume during the first 5 minutes &#x96; especially the haranguing, racist lawyer in the court scene. The dialog often seems to be almost mundane filler, but no phrase or word is wasted because everything comes back to haunt later as the lies and deceit crash back down the mountain of infidelity. Meanwhile their workday routines are what anchor the sad survivors.Ford is an IAD detective investigating a crime lord who's brazen enough to attempt murder in broad daylight. Kristin Scott Thomas works very well as the icy preppie congress-critter kicking off a campaign and determined to keep any whiff of negativity at bay. Her strategy is to move on immediately since there's nothing she can do to bring back either her cheating husband or his lover. But Ford is a cop and has to know; not so much out of spite, but because his training taught him to spot liars &#x96; and he couldn't believe that his wife had duped him. Naturally they realize their spouses were leading double lives while their friends and co- workers covered for them.The couple finally realize as the gossip reaches her daughter that they both need closure. Both stars played the best, most convincing roles of their careers. Harrison Ford in particular reached his John Wayne moment. The love scene in her car at National Airport is so packed with intense emotion that words escape me.If you hated it the first time around, try it again, and repeat, this is not a chick flick.

The betrayals and reactions to them are hard to watch, but they're plausible. In fact, while the incessant, almost obsessive pursuit of details by the betrayed husband, Dutch, apparently made some of the reviewers uncomfortable, it was a likely reaction - especially given that it challenged not only his role as a male and husband, but, perhaps more, it brought into question his savvy and astuteness - not an easy thing for a police investigator.

When something very bad happens to you, you do feel confused and battered, and the lead characters in Random Hearts reflect this well.The criminal sub-plot does feel a bit redundant, like it's strayed in from another film. Perhaps it was some kind of attempt to keep a fig leaf of commerciality on what is basically a couple of hours of numb meditation, although I haven't read the original novel so I don't know if it had some greater significance that I missed.Some of the other reviews on here quite rightly call Random Hearts noir and cathartic, the film equivalent not so much of watching paint dry as watching a river flow.

It had a great director, a bona fide superstar as leading man, a terrific female lead and an interesting premise for the story.  The beginning of the film is masterful.  The spouses of two air crash victims go about the routines of their lives as the news of the disaster creeps into the fringes of their consciousness.  As most of us do, they regard the news with a disconnected interest, another news story about strangers dying.  Suddenly, it occurs to Dutch (Harrison Ford) that his wife said she was going to Miami and he discovers two awful truths, that she was killed and that she was traveling with another man.  He then informs the wife of that man that her husband was on the plane.  The treatment of this entire chain of events was extraordinarily well done.Unfortunately, after this the story bogs down and becomes highly contrived.  Dutch then becomes obsessed with knowing everything about the illicit relationship.  This is almost believable.  But he also drags Kay, (Kristin Scott Thomas) into the vortex and they develop this complicated relationship of grief, passion and maybe even love.  Not so believable.The microscopic character study that ensues of the complex emotions and reactions of the characters is well done, but the viewers find themselves wondering why they have to watch it since most sane people would just have let it go.  After all, the offenders are dead, and little is to be gained by knowing the details of the betrayal.The story also introduces a completely superfluous subplot about the pursuit of a crooked cop by Dutch, a detective in internal affairs.  The only distant connection to the plot is the fact that Kay and Dutch are together during the shootout with the bad cop.As filmmaking, this film is first rate as would be expected from Sydney Pollack.  The color and exposures were particularly rich and the scenes compelling.  I particularly liked the scenes from the tango nightclub.  There were a broad range of different settings and situations and all were handled with great realism.Harrison Ford was asked to play a character quite different from his customary strong, direct and dynamic roles.  This character was far more complex than any he ever attempted and Ford didn't have the range necessary to give a satisfying performance.  He was fine in the cop scenes, but in the scenes with Kristin Scott Thomas he was overly subdued, almost like he was medicated.  This made his performance seem lifeless.Kristin Scott Thomas, on the other had was brilliant.  She showed incredible command of all the myriad emotional states that Kay sustained.  As a British actress playing an American, her accent was flawless, though the character being from New Hampshire should have had a New England accent.Overall, I gave this film a 7/10.  Despite the plot flaws, it was well constructed and as a character study it was excellent.  Most viewers will find such in-depth character studies slow and boring, so if you are looking for pace, you might want to pass on this film.

It's just a shame that he has been given nothing but insufficient scripts lately. The same goes for Kristin Scott Thomas, but her last film, The Horse Whisperer, was one of the best of last year. Then we have Charles Dutton, Bonnie Hunt, Dennis Haysbert, and Sydney Pollack--all potentially fine actors and actresses. Not surprisingly, the performances here are superb. Even though Random Hearts isn't necessarily bad, in the end it only proves that even these performances can't save this movie from defeat; it can't focus past the end of its nose.	Random Hearts opens with a great setup, in which two separate individuals meet after each of their spouses were killed in a tragic plane crash on their way to an exotic island carrying on an ongoing affair. Harrison Ford stars as Dutch Van Den Broeck, is a detective, or something or other--not that it really matters all that much. He is right in the middle of a big murder case when he meets Kay Chandler (Kristin Scott Thomas) and discovers the secret to his wife's death and dismay. Kay is a struggling but well-known candidate in the center of a heated election, campaigning against the scum of the earth. She and her teenage daughter are both in sorrow, but also in denial, regarding the loss of a member in their outwardly happy family. Again, great setup. The film contains two different characters and two separate points of view. The movie then introduces the subject of Kay and Dutch's involvement's with each other Dutch would give anything to have his many questions answered about the entanglement with his wife and Kay's husband. Why did they begin an affair? How long was it going on? Were there any other adulterers involved? How did they get away with this? At first Kay seems a bit repetitive, but it is not long before Kay and Dutch are sleeping with each other, as they seemingly discover it was destiny that allowed the two of them to collide.	Wait a minute! I though this movie was going to detail a tearful search for answers to questions about the affair, not about Dutch and Kay falling in love? Well, they do fall in love. The only thing keeping them from serious commitments is her job and his love for his late wife.Random Hearts is very effective in its old fashioned style. At times the production is quite slow moving and when not, it keeps tedious material nearby. This is pretty tame content here, much milder than the usual Harrison Ford character. I'm quite surprised it got an R-rating, it seems notably PG-13 to me, but maybe teenagers and kids would get bored with the material. Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas both are blossoming with inspiring romantic chemistry. The love triangle of the marriages is a beautiful concept. I only wish we knew more about what was going on.The main flaw here is not in character but structure. The first act is strong, but after that the film seems like a random collage of events, which may be related to each other, but certainly not woven together like they should have been. The ultimate failure is due to an overly confident beginning--then the writers do too much of a good thing complicate things, but never introduce or conclude the subplots in an appropriate way. Lets see, besides the would-be mystery involving the affair, the plane crash, the romantic sparks between Kay and Dutch, this film is about a top secret case which Dutch is in the middle investigating, the heated upcoming election of a candidate running for mayor, Dutch's stolen watch, the murder of a witness, the turmoil a mother and daughter go through when their father dies, best friend cheating on each other's spouses and always being there to save the day, a drive by shooting, the lack of humility, competition, reputation, identity...Brought to you by Columbia Pictures.

Random Hearts is a movie with a very human, but complex theme. Two people meeting each other after their loved ones have died in a plane crash. Then they discover that both of them have had an affair. Coincidence, the affair of Dutch Van den Broeck's wife was with the husband of congress member Kay Chandler. Both character are brilliantly performed by Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas. They have very different ways in dealing with this issue.Van den Broeck, being a policeman, who never suspected that his wife was having an affair (the movie starts with her inviting him to bed), just wants to know why... (When was the last time that she spoke the truth to me) Kay Chandler wants to get rid of the thought as soon as possible and tries to concentrate on her job, being elected to congress again, and her daughter (She must not know what her father has done). They meet each other in Dutch's search for the truth.While going through a very difficult time of accepting and dealing with their partner's death and adultery, both Key and Dutch grow towards each other. This is pictured very intensely and beautifully. Kay states is beautifully in the interview she gives in the hospital when Dutch has bee shot, We are friends, but because of what we have gone through together, we are now more than friends, we are survivors.There is no real why for the adultery, as Dutch discovers when listening to the voice-mail of the telephone in the apartment that was used for the adultery, when Peyton Van den Broeck says, Why are we doing what we are doing?.I don't see why people cannot just enjoy this very intense movie and they think it is a dull and horrible movie. OK, the end was a bit disappointing, but that was probably because I was under the impression that I was watching a romance and romances must have a certain ending. I think, however, psychological drama, may be a more fitting description of this movie.One thing is for sure I came into the cinema when the movie started and when the movie ended I went out of the cinema again. In between I was so taken by the beauty of the movie and the intenseness of the development in the two main characters that I just hadn't noticed how much time had gone by.

Harrison Ford ignites the screen with his presence as he tries to figure out why in what appeared to be a perfect marriage did his wife cheat on him. `There's has to be something.

About halfway through, I picked up a crossword puzzle while my wife attempted to enjoy it. Boring, long, two different plots which had no connection, and totally unintersting.  Even the 'thriller' portion of the movie was just an excuse by the director to wake the deadened viewer.  My wife, who loves love stories, said that they didn't even succeed in making a succesful love story.  So if that's the only reason to see this movie, then they even failed in that area.

And if Kaye was just gearing up for election, it most likely would have been early spring or even late winter. I worry when producers ignore such obvious inconsistencies, perhaps rationalizing that dumb viewers won't notice or even care. It also stretches my credulity to think that anyone would fly all the way from Washington to Miami and back in one day for a very short meeting. Oh. One other thing.

He clearly hasn't produced or directed anything in a long time, and I'm including the Talented Mr. Ripley in this. (Sense and Sensibility is the last good one for me, but that was largely due to Emma Thompson)Always one to use a big name male star in all of his films, Random Hearts goes by the same Pollock formula by casting Harison Ford as the deeply driven, morose, detective who is on a crusade to find out why his wife was having an affair with another man, in which he doesn't find out about it until after her tragic death in a horrific plane crash with her paramour (Peter Coyote) at her side.In true Pollack fashion of grabbing an actress of the moment, Kristin Scott Thomas plays a Congresswoman/wife of Peter Coyote who also has no knowledge of her husband's indiscreetions and is both appalled and shocked at Ford's insistence that their late spouses were involved and in true detective fashion, they should investigate further.   What this movie is trying to reveal is that behind every happy marriage is a dark side of wanting to feel young and alive while still maintaining a regular monogamy with their spouse. What it sadly does is show nothing more then the dark sides of the betrayed survivors and they're indiscretion in what should be their time of grief.One has to wonder if Pollack's reasoning for making this film was to come to grips with an indiscretion of his own or the  loss of a loved one who may have betrayed him.  It clearly just doesn't come over very well in film and the story is just plain depressing.The bright spots to the film are the accurate portrayal of a airliner crash scene and the dismal task of survivors having to identify their loved one's remains.  This film's defining moment is when both of the deceased are displayed on a small video screen with a tragic waste of life-look on their faces. Sadly, this film is just like this scene. It should be properly buried as soon as possible. "}{"Title":"Zzzzzz.........","Date":"26 April 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Mystery, Romance","Review":"  You know, I really like movies.

Unfortunately, I could find little of value that Random Hearts had to offer.Well, I had higher hopes for this movie. I've always said I'd see anything with Harrison Ford in it, but even an actor of his caliber was unable to save a snoozer of a story like this one. In short, my two primary complaints were this 1) About 45 minutes too long; 2) Conspicuously devoid of any decent action or humor. On top of that, the characters did not represent people I would particularly like in real life, so why would I give a flying flip if they ended up happy or not? Kristin Scott Thomas' character, Kay, is too cold and snobby, and the relationship these two people develop seems too haphazard and confusing for any of us to really care. Plus there's that bizarre scene in the car (of course, I won't tell you what it is), which just added to my distaste for this movie because it made me say yet again yeah, right..give me a break.

There should probably be a rule--every screenwriter should see this movie.   Because if not the acting, not necessarily the screenplay itself ( the movie is totally believable ), the movie fails in the reaction it creates in the audience.   Starting with the plane crash that leads to questions of infidelity about a congress woman's husband and a policeman's wife, this movie spins a whirlpool of depression so powerful that the viewer is sucked in. We root for the characters and wish them happiness, but like the shattered victims of senseless crime in real life we find ourselves emotionally shutting ourselves off from them.

What it doesn't say is that Ford is a sergeant in Internal Affairs and Kristin Scott Thomas is a Congresswoman gearing up for an election fight.  This information, however, is worse than useless, it is distracting. Ford's current dirty-cop case and the sketchy political machinations surrounding Scott Thomas' campaign have the feel of an afterthought, one designed to give weight to the stars' sense of loss and, in Ford's case, to introduce a bit of action into an otherwise stagnant tale.  It adds nothing to the principal storyline.  (Those expecting some grand plot to develop around the fact that a Congresswoman's husband and an Internal Affairs sergeant's wife are killed will be greatly disappointed.)Stilling the waters of this landlocked pool of pseudo-intrigue still further is the film's sense of humor, or lack thereof.  This is one of the most humorless films to come along in some time.  When Scott Thomas delivers her big joke--she wants to know if Ford is a democrat--Ford takes it seriously, asking why she wants to know.Random Hearts is also one of the least psychologically astute movies to appear in a while.  All the time that should have gone into developing the relationship between Ford and Scott Thomas instead got diverted into the meaningless activity of their careers, leaving the two of them looking anemic and pathetic and leaving a gaping hole in their relationship.

I would watch this film as soon as possible without reading any bad review. Would I be disappointment?I read a lot of review which is said how bad this film was This is boring, long film without passion emotions and it is not interesting. Harrison is wooden, cold. The sublots should be cut. Too serious, particularly for Harrison Ford. I am interested in the subject, and I like Harrison Ford in the films which are not actions. I like Sidney Pollack and Kristin Scott Thomas too. So reading the reviews on IMDB website then in other sites then in February in the Hungarian movie magazines I was wonder and wonder what the film was. Anyway there are films, directors, stars what/who I want to see despite any reviews.I can understand people who thinks this film is boring and cold and has got not any passion, but I feel different. It is true I liked Sliding Doors, The Forbidden Woman (this is a French film, I don't know what its title in English, or in French). Basic of these films is development of a love.I think Random Heart is a nice and interesting film in its own way.It may be true that the sublots -the congress election and the cop's investigation after a corrupt policeman- are not written well, are not worked out in details but add something to the leading woman and man character.After his wife's death and betrayal emotion, angry of Dutch comes to the surface during his work. He will be suspicious and almost lost his best  friend (then the woman too). The film shows two ways to survive the tragedy our wife/husband's death and cheating.  One of them is the woman's this is tragedy,  but the life is continuing.  She doesn't want to mourn forever. What she wants to know-what her husband's lover-the cop's wife- thought about her she will not learn never. She is forced to behave in this way. The elections are comes, and anything about his husband may become scandal. She wants her daughter not to be disappointment with her father. The man is a cop.He suffering from the fact he lived in lies. He wants to know -maybe every men would want to know in this situation-when his wife started to cheat him. How long had she got lover?. He needs the woman's help but she doesn't want, but the guy is stubborn and steady/persistent. The woman can't stand him because he always steps into her life and she cannot forget. Their relationship is tense at the beginning then slowly developments a type of silent sympathy which is prefer an alliance against the outside world, the tragedy. (I said it in spite of that they made love in bed) However the cop,  can't stop with investigation, can't stop close and can't allow the woman close to him but he starts the love, and the woman wants their relationship to continue. But it can't. The woman realizes it. The end is a bit sad, but logic, and nice at the same time.It was pleasant for me to see again Peter Coyote-I like this man's face- Sidney Pollack. I hardly knew Bonnie Hunt but she was good.I think Harrison Ford did an okay job. His eardrop is unusual but at the beginning then finally I believed that the woman liked being at his company in spite of his temperament.  It was pity he had not got any joke. But Ford has got a good sense of humour. A reviewer noticed (in Hungary) Ford is charismatic against his haircut and ear drop and we are waiting for his presence and would like him to smile at us and make an ironic notice. But Dr Jones is not smiling at us.. But he smiles at the end and it is soooo good. With the rest  I agree. I very like him in this role- He is good in acting of this a bit rough, cool but somewhere in his soul smart cop.. The character of Kristin Scott Thomas is a woman who is determined, self confident, but she is closed inside a ivory tower and she keeps aloof from her emotions.

It is full of common, banal sentence, but there are some humorous sentences from the woman and movement particularly from the man.

About the latter, maybe Sidney Pollack made this film for his age-group which doesn't go to multiplex.

The plot line is that Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas have both lost their spouses to a plane crash. The catch is that their spouses were having an affair with each other. Harrison Ford is unconvincing as a jealous and remorseful widower. Kriston Scott Thomas is cold and aloof throughout the movie, except for brief bursts of lust. The interaction between Ford and Thomas is unemotional and rarely romantic.

(I can't lay claim to the description by the way. Lay the blame my Wife's way).	But as usual she was right. Ford's not necessarily full of it, but he sure looks that way. Harrison Ford spends much of the film looking doleful, unsatisfied, overfed. He's supposed to be heart broken but has been ignored so completely by screenwriter Kurt Luedtke (Out Of Africa, Absence Of Malice) that mind broken would seem to be closer to the mark.Ford plays a Washington cop called Dutch who works in internal investigations. Snazzy sunglasses. An earing. He's a bit of a snappy dresser because his wife (played by Susanna Thompson) works for a fashion house. She heads off suddenly to Miami by aeroplane for her work.Kay Chandler (Kristin Scott Thomas) is a politician who's husband also suddenly leaves suddenly, he says for New York, on business. A plane goes down and the travelling husband and wife are found strapped to adjacent seats under an entirely new hubby and wife name, dead.Kay is up for re-election. It's bad enough that her husband has died but she doesn't want her husband's philandering ways to hit the press.Dutch who was in love with his wife, goes a bit screwball and goes on an investigative binge. He has to know the details of the affair.Dutch and Kay meet. Will a new love blossom? Could these two fall into each other's arms within days of their spouses' untimely deaths?Justifying this, making it believable for the viewers, is a huge dilemma for a filmmaker, even one with the track record of director Sydney Pollack.Pollack directed Out Of Africa, Three Days Of The Condor, Absence Of Malice, The Way We Were, They Shoot Horses Don't They, The Firm and  Tootsie, among others (including the pretty awful Sabrina).Random Hearts works very well indeed for its first third. It sets a cracking pace presenting the far too busy, overstressed, western, urban, lifestyle of the two married couples in a breathtakingly complex and rush about way. No wonder these married people had drifted apart!There's Dutch the cop dealing with a corrupt colleague and Kay the politician marshalling her energies and troops for her  campaign. Television screens, mobile phones, quick commuter flights and particularly voice mail intrude and are used to distraction.The general theme is that of perfidy and treachery, of the lie and its sibling called distrust, taking precedence as the usual means of communication. Is there anyone in this world of police, politicians, husbands and wives who can be trusted?Can these two overcome the loss of their partners and the discovery of the adultery and get on with their lives? And should they be upset about the adultery anyway? One of the characters speaks eloquently in favour of affairs. She'd hate to live without the excitement of illicit romances!Now all of this is interesting enough but what of the execution? Well, I'm afraid that once the plane's gone down, so does the film.It's as though Pollack ran out of airspace with his aircraft. He reduced Dutch to mostly standing about in that Harrison Ford, hair standing on end way even if Kristin Scott Thomas, an English actress, American accent wavering, tried to inject life and brevity into what became an increasingly stolid movie.Scott Thomas (The English Patient, The Horse Whisperer) is an intelligent actress who managed Kay very well indeed and Harrison Ford would have done a lot better with a better script, or at least some more lines. Looking heartbroken for an hour and a half is quite rightly the realm of French actresses, not American leading men.On the plus side, at least Ford's leading lady wasn't improbably younger than him this time, but then for the final insult we were treated to a classic Hollywood, let's tie up all of the loose ends ending. That left me groaning and as constipated as poor old Dutch.

I had enjoyed the work of Pollack and Ford on Sabrina, a well made film and a careful rewrite of the old material.  On hearing that this film was in production I ordered and read the book.  Immediately it seemed  that this would be a more difficult story to film.   The characters are not always sympathetic,  there is little if any humor and the author makes  numerous plot shortcuts to focus on his principal  theme that, since each would see the other as the  only one sharing the unique combination of loss and betrayal brought on by the air crash, the adulterers' completely surprised spouses would seek each other out.  Moreover, he imagines that resolution could come to both through a bitter exploration of the adulterers' hidden lives and that this experience of thick and thin could yield a deeper love than each had previously.  Although much of the book deals with their bitterness and their building hatred of  their former partners, in the end acceptance and  forgiveness are found.      The film script retains only the air crash and the shared predicament of the spouses. Where the woman is the research aggressor in the book, it is the man  in the film and the woman is never a willing  co-researcher.  The film has a completely new  dramatic sub-plot for Harrison Ford which seems even  more contrived than the double coincidence of the air crash.  The congresswoman up for re-election  sub-plot for the woman is also new, yet it works  better.      Audience the expectations of pure romance or  romantic comedy cannot be met because this story  focusses on a very bitter pill.  Where resolution and  forgiveness is achieved in the book, however, lifting  the burden of bitterness from the reader and  permitting levity, there is no corresponding moment  in the film.  Although forgiveness is never hinted at, we are left to surmise that healing following a  shooting does double duty.  Ford's character need not  be such an unentertaining man of few words and  Scott-Thomas's accent change is a little  disconcerting at first.      This film is not the dead loss suggested by  others.  It is, however, a difficult film to  appreciate because the rewrite and adaptation to the screen is below the standard previously achieved by  the director cast.

The main plot was well-thought out, however the sub-plot (where Harrison Ford does the actual police work) was slow, seemingly meaningless, and difficult to follow.  It wasn't until the very end that the subplot was finally tied into the main story.As a minor point, in more than one scene, you will find obvious references to major sponsors.

The main idea seems to be about doubling and echoing - their twin interest in what happened and the pain of the loss and the absence pulls them together	such that they're not sure what's a truly experienced emotion and what merely arises as a matter of structure and proximity at a time of crisis; Ford's job as an internal affairs officer, both pursuing and goading a dirty cop, ought to be further elaboration on this, as should be the theme of projection and image-making (as in her political campaign).

Random Hearts is billed as a thriller, but contains a bare minimum of testosterone-laced action one might be expecting.  It does, however, have a serious dose of something that we don't often see in movies today.  In-your-face reality.This is a rather intriguing (and to some married couples, possibly more than a little disturbing) story of two people grieving over their respective spouses when they are informed that their bodies were found in a jetliner crash.  The kicker being that neither one was supposed to be on the airplane in the first place, and in the second place were having an affair together.Harrison Ford's character, Sergeant Dutch Van Den Broeck,  is a Washington D.C. Internal Affairs police officer who discovers that his wife's last minute answering machine message about a business trip is a lie when he stops at her place of work in a panic to verify which flight she was on. When her manager tells him point blank that the wife is most certainly not traveling for work, the glimmer of something not quite right sparks in his eye, and his cop instincts kick into high gear.As U.S. Congresswoman Kay Chandler, Kristen Scott Thomas portrays the other surviving spouse.  So caught up in her job (fancy that!) and her re-election campaign, she is completely caught off guard when she finds out not only that her husband is now dead, but that he had some extracurricular activities of which she was totally unaware.Some might see the relationship that ensues between these two grieving spouses to be a bit ridiculous or contrived.  I think that any psychologist dealing in traumatic situations would be able to tell you in no uncertain terms that it's a very natural reaction for the story to take this turn.Two people, feeling betrayed, lonely, and grieving the loss of a spouse and the very relationships they thought they had turn to each other to find some sort of solace.  Perhaps, even, as a way to get even with their deceased and unfaithful spouses in the only way they possibly could.There are definitely some steamy scenes in this film that are a serious departure from Ford's usually more romance-oriented characters.  The scenes don't come across as gratuitous though, but filled with pent up need and loss that culminates in these two escaping into each other for a short while.This is not a glamorous film, and with the nature of the subject matter, it certainly shouldn't be one.  Some folks who are looking for a traditional Harrison Ford, action-packed thriller could be quite disappointed and might consider the reality of the film to be more disturbing than entertaining. Those folks may wish to wait until the next Tom Clancy or Indiana Jones-type movie comes along.

This romantic drama was quite a treat. I'm sure this story will not be everyone's cup of tea, especially considering the film's darkly downbeat premise. But the pic has some very uplifting strong points in its favor.All-time Box Office Draw Harrison Ford (Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Fugitive, Air Force One, Patriot Games) is at the top of his game as the harried and desperate Internal Affairs officer, Dutch. Ford's very subdued, nuanced performance shows quite the range he can achieve with class and determination in bringing the audience into his world of loss & betrayal. This is the perfect complex role and very different type of film for Harrison Ford to grace the screen with between his action blockbusters. Next year Harrison Ford returns to action, first for director Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump, Back To The Future) in his summer 2000 thriller, What Lies Beneath, and reportedly later in the year in the film adaptation of Tom Clancy's The Sum Of All Fears. 'Fears' will be Harrison Ford's third outing as CIA operative Jack Ryan.Director Sydney Pollack (Out of Africa, The Firm, Tootsie) has a supporting role in this feature as a political advisor to Scott-Thomas' congresswoman. It's a very sharp & energetic portrayal for Pollack. Not only is Sydney Pollack a gifted director, he is also one of the most believable, natural and charming actors around (see Eyes Wide Shut as well).Kristin Scott-Thomas (The English Patient, The Horse Whisperer) shows that you don't necessarily have to be eccentric or worldly to be considered sexy. This is one of her better films, and she gives a tremendously crafted and mellowed performance that works well opposite Ford's quiet-man toughness.The subplots work wonderfully, especially the subplot involving Ford's character's investigation into police corruption. Look for a chilling & effective turn by Heat actor, Dennis Haysbert, who plays Detective George Beaufort, the obstacle to overcome in Dutch's investigation into police corruption.The rest of the supporting cast is a wonderful delight. Charles S. Dutton (whose long overdue for a film leading role) goes to show that he is one of the best character-actors around, and Bonnie Hunt, who I find extremely solid in this production, steals most of her scenes with that wonderful, charming smile as Wendy Judd.The technical side of Pollack's thriller is top notched. From Dave Grusin's (Pollack's The Firm) perfectly surreal-feeling jazzy score, to Philippe Rousselot (A River Runs Through It) crisp photography, to the sharp editing that keeps the film feeling fresh, despite the film's unfortunate downer premise.I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good yarn of mystery, well-paced plot, character-driven stories, and romance all rolled into one. This is a terrific story about betrayal & forgiveness. It also features one of the most surprising, yet poignant, and certain to be controversial endings for a Harrison Ford film in recent times. Random Hearts is definitely one of the better films of the year.(***1/2 out of ****) or (8.5 out of 10.0)  "},{"Title":"Good acting, too long","Date":"10 October 1999","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Mystery, Romance","Review":"  There's no doubt that the acting was great.

I'm not such a big fan of his more dramatic roles.  Although I have liked many of Ford's movies, they all seem to have the same kind of feel to them.  This movie is no exception.  There is a love story, which kind of comes from left field and then goes nowhere fast.  There is the struggle to find out the truth about his wife.  And there is the sub-plot about the crooked cop. As I watched Random Hearts, I found that I could sympathize for Ford's character.  But I just had a hard time getting into the movie.  I would probably recommend this movie for video night.

Now, try to imagine this agony exacerbated by the knowledge that your spouse was headed for an illicit rendezvous when they died the combination of grief and betrayal is simply too overwhelming to comprehend.  This is what confronts Dutch Van Den Broeck (Harrison Ford) a hard-nosed cop with DC Internal Affairs and Kay Chandler (Kristin Scott Thomas) a US Congresswoman, when their cheating spouses are killed in a plane crash.  With heavy hitters Ford and Thomas on the Marquee, and the subject matter in question,  I expected a well crafted, intriguing movie, or at the very least, an entertaining one.  If only it were so.  Hearts suffers from a flat, poorly written script, with corny formulaic dialogue - several touching moments left the audience in hysterics - leaving the actors with little too work with.  The problems don't end there.From its inception this movie was obviously intended as a romantic drama.  I can only assume that the subplot involving an investigation of a duo of dirty cops was added as an afterthought to secure the ever-important 18-35 male demographic. The result is a quixotic mess every time the movie begins to flow and find its legs, it veers off on a tangent, until you longer care what happens. When the credits finally started rolling after 133 minutes I was positively exhausted. Unless you've seen all the movies that are currently out or are desperate for a pseudo date flick, give this a miss.

This film has had a gestation period of over ten years, as they say in the industry, `in development hell'. The final product is a mixed blessing. Pollack has directed the script by Kurt Luedtke from the novel by Warren  Adler. Many changes have been made from the original, prompting Pollack to say that the resulting film was actually just suggested by the novel. Dutch Van Den Broeck (Ford), a detective, and Kay Chandler (Thomas), a Congressman, are the unwitting spouses of a couple who have been having an affair. The illicit relationship only comes to light when the adulterers are involved in a plane crash and listed on the flight's roster as man and wife. Dutch and Kay eventually meet and their journey of discovery is the meat of the remainder of the tale. The script itself only reveals the simplest of plots. However, the measured, subtle performances of the two leads are what make you care. A subplot involving Dutch's job as police detective seems irrelevant to the main direction of the story, but the two dovetail excitingly, bringing the tale to its only realistic  conclusion. Supporting players, Charles Dutton (Dutch's detective partner), Dennis Haysbert (a cop on the take), Kate Mara (Kay's daughter) and Bonnie Hunt (Kay's close friend) add to the mix with their expert portrayals. Even Pollack himself has given himself a small role. The running time is a bit long for a film of this type, but Ford and Thomas will keep your interest because they both play appealing characters with whom audiences can definitely identify.

If this film had been European, it would have been about simple people in simple surroundings.  Because this is a Hollywood movie, the events surrounding the characters are HUGE a plane crash, a congresswoman, American politics, the media, crime in the city.  The movie could have floundered around so many premises, but instead it works.  It takes its time to tell the story and sometimes that time seems slow, but the events the story tells would take a long time to unveil and so it is understandable that the story would not be over in 90 minutes.Kristin Scott Thomas and Harrison Ford look wonderful in this picture.  It isn't true, as many critics have said, that Ford is plodding in it.  He seems like a man obsessed with unraveling the truth about his dead wife, what made her cheat on him and what the truth about his own life is, and he is very believable in it.  Thomas looks stunning.  When she's on screen, you can hardly look at anything else. The music by Dave Grusin is wonderfully dreamy and sad, like the story.If there is one problem with this picture is that it has no edge.  I know this sounds like a cliche but it is true, and when you see it you'll understand.  Nothing in it feels new or innovative, and it's like it was made for an older audience by an older filmmaker.  Nothing wrong with that, but in the age of so many edgy and inventive films rediscovering the possibilities of movies, Random Hearts is to today's audiences what An Affair to Remember must have been to audiences in the days when Sidney Pollack was a younger filmmaker making edgy things like Three Days of the Condor.

She's a politician who wants to FORGET IT and hope nobody finds out about IT.The subplot of Harrison Ford's career (which most seem to be complaining about) shows how your work can be affected by personal matters.  While the details of his police work don't complement the movie's theme, his emotional reactions do make sense.Actually, the most distracting aspects I found in the film were the two shots where the boom mike comes into view.

Just think, I could have been saved from watching this major embarrassement to the canon of Harrison Ford if only Sydney Pollack had called Steven Soderbourgh for pointers.

Moreover, Ford's character was thoroughly disagreeable, which did not help to involve the audience in the plot which surrounded him.

To keep it short-- Kristen Thomas (the chick) is great-- she has developed quite a talent in the past few years since Four Weddings and a Funeral.

Overall, he looks like a mental patient-- the spikey gray hair thing is NOT happening here, on your head, dood!The first half of the movie was decent. A somewhat calm, but intriguing cop show thing, with romance. Then the second half was not just slow-- it was so slow it went backwards. I came out of the theater ten minutes before I went in, and I was in there 2-1/2 hours.Ford's voice-- was it looped or what? All the other actors and ambient sounds were normal, and then his masculine voice (which is fine), continually boomed out in basso profundo, as if they had a microphone stuffed down his throat. At the very beginning, he was eating some food, and you could hear, in booming surround sound, every drop of saliva sloshing and smacking around, from his lips well down into his small intestines. That is WAY too much audio info folks! Throughout the movie his microphone was picking up his every gulp, lip smack, throat clearing, and other slurps and sloshes associated with being too close to another human being with whom you are not making love. What's that about? Does the director think that obnoxious and annoying replay of all things scatological and saliva-related imply closeness? Or realness? Or whatever...?The slowness of the movie in the second half was not the hypnotic, dreamy pace of The Horse Whisperer. Rather, it was the stilted, jerky can't get it right repetitivenss we see with waiters and waitresses working under tremendous stress on their first day on the job. It was maddening! Imagine Laurel and Hardy on Qualudes, and the film played back in slow motion-- and not for laughs, but to be serious and soulful. YIKES! It was torture to sit and squirm through it all.

Meanwhile, congresswoman Kay (Kristin Scott-Thomas), running for re-election, is also handed the difficult news that the husband she thought was headed for New York City was also on the downed Miami plane. Dutch, driven to discover the truth, learns that the man his wife was traveling with was, indeed, the candidate's mate.

Although the book was probably successful, the resulting movie is weak and plodding, to say the least. Of course, it is a welcome event when a film features a love story between two middle aged players but, in this case, it is more melodramatic than meaningful. Although they try hard, Ford and Scott Thomas can not rise above the stilted roles they have been given. Kurt Luedtke, who penned the lovely Out of Africa, strikes a false note here with his efforts. Then, too, although the costumes and sets are gorgeous, the direction by the talented Synday Pollack is also misguided, resulting in a wandering and killingly-slow paced flick.

While I hate to use that dreadful moment in our history as a staple for this review, one cannot help but consider the connections and possibilities between the fictitious story of this film and those unthinkable WTC events. Director Sydney Pollack has done a fabulous job of adapting a story that is both suspenseful, creative, and full of human emotion. He did a superb job of casting both Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott-Thomas who engulf these sinister characters and bring that much-needed emotion to the screen. His music seems cheesy at times, yet draws you into some scenes the next. With all of these great elements coming together for Random Hearts, why is it that so many people have rated this film low? My response to that has to do with seeing this film in a completely different light. There were elements that I thought were brilliant, yet needed to have some thought involved. Harrison Ford was one of these elements, as well as Pollack's use of airports throughout the film. Let me explain.I saw Harrison Ford as this very evil character in this film. Perhaps this was not the tone that Pollack was hoping to create with Random Hearts, but it was what I witnessed when I watched it. When you watch it, see if you see it as well. Throughout the film Ford pushes Thomas into what he wants. He invades her life, rummages through her personal moments, and even seduces her to discover more information. He is the one most hurt by this disaster, and it turns him dark. While most will argue that the event brought these two hearts together, I think Ford's character was weaker than we imagined. He needed that comfort level that his wife provided and found it with Thomas. He wasn't going to stop until he was with her and found out everything he could about his cheating wife. Ford was creepy to me in this film. While I think Kristin Scott-Thomas did an outstanding job countering this insanity that Ford brought with him, it was really Ford that captured the aura of the film. Thomas was like a child being lead throughout the mall by her determined father. Broken, hurt, destroyed, and even paranoid were all elements that were creeping into Ford's life, and he had no clue how to handle them, so he attached himself to Thomas &#133; perhaps more than he should have.Take Ford's powerful character and Thomas' weakened version of Kay and throw in Pollack's mastermind and you honestly have an amazing film. The scenes that really blew my mind in this film were how Pollack continually brought Ford and Thomas back into the airport. It was because of an airport that these two random strangers met, now throughout the film, they have some of their toughest moments back in that same airport. When they return of Miami sparks a new chapter for both of them, the scene where they both are flying, but cannot be seen together was beautifully awkward and dark, then at the end when they meet together for the climax, it felt a bit stalker-ish to me. Ford was spooky, nearly saying that he cannot continue life without Thomas' comfort. His final speech was supposed to be happy, but to me came across as very wimpy and boarding on lunacy. It was amazing.While the background stories seem to mesh well, I honestly could have done with less of Thomas' story of trying to win an election, and pushed more of Ford's story of how the loss of his wife was destroying his career. I thought this was a really interesting segway that should have been explored more. I wanted to see the fall of Ford, and I think he was just about there. I wanted to see him break down and really turn into this Hitchcockian character. I wanted to really see him corrupt his life because his persistence on detail created this flawed marriage. There was so much more that should have been done with Ford's character, that I was continually biting my nails hoping that Pollack would take that Requiem for a Dream direction. Alas, he did not, I am not sure if it was because he was trying to attract a different audience or what, but Pollack had a dark film on his hands, sadly, he just didn't push that envelope that far.Overall, as odd that this may sound, I was impressed with this film. I believe this was one of those rare Hollywood instances where they had the chance to really scare us with some backwards characters, but instead changed to this high road of romance and drama. I saw this film as a very disturbing film thanks to the work of Harrison Ford. I am not sure if this was the direction either he or Pollack saw the film going, but it is what I experienced in my viewing. I really suggest you go back and see this film with its darker undertones. I may be pulling this out of nowhere, but to me Ford was spooky, Thomas was this pushover that Ford manipulated, and Pollack had a masterpiece before his time. Random Hearts was an unexpected film that I cannot wait to watch again!

It's about very human reactions to extraordinary events. The director is very good and both Ford and Thomas are excellent. Thomas is very feminine too in a initially reserved way. The influence from Kubric, as some people point out, is definitely a positive factor. I cannot understand why the critics so grossly underrate this fine piece of work. I can understand that some people found it depressive, it deals with tragic and difficult things like mourning, betrayal and so on. Life is unfortunately not always sunshine. The feeling described in the film are very real according to me. The director is a person with talent and integrity and a good actor to boot. I will however admit that some people might find the issues here somewhat boring - until they realize that the issues might concern them as well, in some sense.

The writers tried to manipulate us into feeling empathy for the man who lost his wife and his trust in mankind at the same time, but it didn't work. I kept holding out hope that the shocking mystery promised on the back of the DVD case would develop into something more than a depressed-cop-gone-bad subplot combined with a who-slept-with-whom-where story which was scarcely worthy of a Young and the Restless script.

Pity, because Random Hearts is outstanding, one of the most beautifully wrought dramas I've ever seen.  Predictable, as some as said?  What's predictable about making Harrison's Ford's character so obsessively unsympathetic, and Kristen Scott-Thomas' so unexpectedly playful and passionate?  That this movie balances so delicately drama, romance and mystery is a tribute to all that are involved. Harrison Ford has never been better, though I could have done without his off-putting spiked haircut. Just as his character is so self-pitying and obsessive one wants to slap him silly, Ford flies into a rage orcracks a self-depreciating line with that wry little smile.  He's great, as is everyone involved.  Special note should also go to director Sidney Pollack for his wonderful performance.  All production values are topnotch, including Dave Grusin's jazz score.I guess I have to thank the rest of you.  Because you hated or slandered this movie, I got a DVD copy for $4.99.

I can understand why many didn't get it and don't think I'm any better for doing so, but I did get it!Random Hearts is film NOIR.  And, if it isn't, then it's heavily steeped in it.  It's got all the key noir themes deceit, suspicion, obsession, heartache, disillusionment, infidelity...You know the routine.  True the usual trappings were gone fedoras, steaming manhole covers, darkness, etc. And I think that because it was such an original treatment of the genre (even more genre-stretching than Chinatown and L.A. Confidential) that the link wasn't made for most and their response was, (at worst) That sucked and (at best) Huh?  I guess what clued me in was the soundtrack.  It was absolutely drenched (almost comically so) with classic noir motifs sultry saxophone, tinkling piano, and the jazzy moan of fretless bass.  Not that I actually like that stuff but I, at least, recognized it.In its response to Random Hearts the American public has made their message clear to Harrison Ford (whether or not he cares).  DO NOT EXPERIMENT! they clamor.  Don't even think about doing anything even slightly outside our box for you.  Or else...  What they miss, of course, is one damn good performance.  Of course, this isn't the first time Ford has played this type of role.  Rick Deckard in Blade Runner was very similar and Rusty Sabich in Presumed Innocent was nearly identical.  Sure, I love Indy and Han but I gotta admit that it's a bit of a relief to see that classic Ford hubris significantly muted (okay, completely eradicated) for these roles.  As 'Dutch', Ford looks old, tired, and crushed.  He plods through each scene and mutters his lines and, in the process, he makes pain look very real.  He embodies it not so much in its sturm und drang but in its inertia and banality.  In the process, he helps heal those of us who know too well what it's like to feel this kind of pain.Those paying attention can see how well he had become this broken man in the final scene at the airport. Ford shows us (by way of contrast) a man who, having been given a bit of time, has begun to mend, to heal.  Though subdued, we can see his hope returning.  Pay close attention to his face as he watches Kristin Scott Thomas' character walk away.  Amazingly, without really DOING anything, he embodies perfectly this still fragile but sanguine stage of the healing process.  Though he doesn't actually tear up, there is a subtle shift in his face (and especially his eyes) and we know that he may be on the mend but that doesn't mean it doesn't still hurt sometimes.Finally, K.S. Thomas was very believable as the tough but human Kay Chandler.  Her stormy love affair with 'Dutch' was appropriately surreal, fragile and yet still tender and special.  I love the scene in the cabin where (lying in bed together) they banter over politics.  It's one of few light moments in a very humorless movie and works well as do so many other scenes.I thought Random Hearts was classy, electric, and bewitching.  I guess I can understand why others didn't like it but I definitely did! "},{"Title":"Entertainment? No!  Catharsis? Yes!

The the female lead fortifies herself with denial though occasionally she reaches out. The male lead tries to fill the void through attempting to comprehend all the details, all the secrets that are revealed by the sudden loss. The female lead would rather not know.  There is a subtle but powerful line spoken by Harrison Ford Perhaps you didn't lose that much!.In a way this film is more about class difference and snobbishness separating two people who have a shared, shattering life experience.

Such is the situation for two people in `Random Hearts,' a drama that explores pain and suffering, despair and obsession, and the sense of isolation and need that overcomes Dutch Van Den Broeck (Harrison Ford) and Kay Chandler (Kristin Scott Thomas) in the wake of a tragic plane crash that claims, respectively, his wife and her husband.  Director Sydney Pollack weaves an intricate story that begins with the hint of the indiscretion, is followed closely by the tragedy, then quickly escalates into the discovery of the affair by Van Den Broeck, who subsequently locates and contacts Chandler. 	In what is essentially a character study of how differently the parties involved respond to their grief, and how the knowledge of the infidelity effects them individually, Pollack very deliberately peals away the layers of emotion until the feelings of each are laid bare and exposed.  Ultimately it becomes the story of their relationship; of the intimate bond formed between these total strangers who share this dark secret foisted upon them in such an unseemly manner.  He is a cop; not only a cop, but an internal affairs cop in Washington, D.C.  It's his job to observe people and to notice situations, to know when something is out of place or just not right.  Yet his own wife was having an affair, and he didn't have a clue; and in dealing with his emotions, in sorting it all out, he becomes obsessed with finding out everything.  Where did they meet, when and how; how long had it been going on?  Who was he, did they have a `place' of their own.  Where were they going on that fateful day?  Adamant, he pushes himself to find the answers, while Kay Chandler, a congresswoman up for reelection, wants nothing to do with it.  Dealing with it in her own way, she opts to pursue a more immediate form of closure on her own, choosing to suppress her feelings while declining Van Den Broeck's attempts to include her in his incessant investigation.  Unlike him, to deal with the pain and confusion, she has to move on.  She doesn't want to know anything about the affair between her husband and his wife, and not because she feels any less than he does; it's simply a matter of doing what she must to cope, just as he is.  The difference  He has to know; she must not.   	Ford does a more than capable job with an emotionally charged, challenging role, using just enough restraint to make the obsession into which he's channeled his feelings effective, keeping the tone subtle rather than overblown and demonstrative.  Scott Thomas is excellent as well, externalizing the predominately internal turmoil she is experiencing with clarity and precision.  She succinctly conveys the depth of her emotions, placing it all just above the surface so that it leaves you with a strong sense of what is really raging just beneath.  There's a definite connection established between Ford and Scott Thomas, but no real chemistry; but then again, this isn't a romantic love story, but a story of two people at loose ends helping one another cope with unique, unfathomable circumstances.  The excellent supporting cast includes Charles Dutton (Alcee), Bonnie Hunt (Wendy), Dennis Haysbert (Beaufort), Sydney Pollack (Carl), Richard Jenkins (Truman), Paul Guilfoyle (Dick), Peter Coyote (Cullen), Susanna Thompson (Peyton) and Dylan Baker (Richard).  `Random Hearts' is a somber film that demonstrates just how vulnerable we all are, and how life as we know it can change in an instant; a solid drama expertly delivered by Pollack and an outstanding cast that leaves the indelible impression that no matter what you think you know, the human heart will forever remain a mystery to us all.

The idea behind RANDOM HEARTS sounds reasonably interesting, but how it's carried out here is horrendous. I never had a single spark of empathy for either of the main characters, and both performances (from what I saw) are lifeless.

Other examples included the way she conveyed her surprise at herself in getting involved with Dutch - both in the car and in the cottage in the woods.  The comments some have made about the indecency of the haste of their relationship seemed to me to miss the point completely.I guess my wife and I also found the detail of the subplot involving Dutch a bit longwinded - until one started to ask the question why it was included. It occurred to me today driving around thinking about it that it was to highlight the incongruity and improbability of a relationship between Kay and Dutch ever occurring under normal circumstances.  Here she was, an upper middle class congressperson about as far removed from the sleazy world of physical violence and betrayal that was Dutch's daily existence as one could imagine.  And then, through death and betrayal, they were brought together into a relationship of mutual need.  It said a  lot about the way in which shared pain can unite even the most improbable partners - and yet this seems to have passed most reviewers by.  The reality of this incongruity, the different way in which it was appreciated by Kay and Dutch in the closing moments of the film was a perceptive insight into differences in male and female psyches.I think you needed to be in mid-life or later to really appreciate this film - and for many in that age group, the theme could have been quite threatening - so as a box office hit it is likely to miss out with both the young and many in their 40s.The sloppy camera work (mike booms appearing on at least 2 occasions) was technically the worst thing about it.As for Kay's accent - well I'm an orstraylian and it seemed near enough to the real thing for me!

I didn't expect to see a lot of action.  I didn't expect to see a huge mystery.  I didn't expect to see a lot of intrigue.  I believe that this was the right thing to do, because I wasn't raising the bar before I saw what was offered.What I saw was something of an intellectual examination of grief, acceptance and renewal.  The film constantly asked questions that had no set answers - I think this was part of the allure for me.  I was very interested in the characters and the different ways they approached the same loss - although it wasn't the same for them, individually.Kay was content in her marriage.  Not delirious, not ecstatic -- content.  She'd had an inkling that Cullen had possibly had affairs here and there, but her personal background (upper middle class Eastern) and her profession (politics) were such that you just don't discuss things like that, or even admit them to yourself out loud - hence, she was able to recover a bit more quickly than Dutch.  She used this tragedy to re-evaluate her life and re-determine what was important.  I believe she chose happiness.Dutch was happy in his marriage.  As far as he knew, things were great.  He was attentive and he spent time with his wife and he saw no signs of discontent within her.  The added factor to this was his profession.  His job is to know when people are lying to him.  His inability to accept the betrayal was compounded by the fact that also couldn't accept that he didn't know what was going on right under his nose - in his own home.  Therefore, it took him a lot longer to let go.I thought the performances by both actors were wonderful. I thought it was a very nice change of pace for Ford - it sort of reminded me of his Regarding Henry role.  And, I haven't yet seen a bad performance out of Scott Thomas in 13 years of following her career - I think she's very much underrated and I think she achieved much with this performance.  As her character lets go, she just gets more and more radiant throughout the film and her acting is just that much more powerful.I think that, more than anything, the general public wasn't exactly ready for such an introspective film and so it may read as boring.  I think it's a crime, because there are a lot of messages and lessons within the film that are extremely beneficial.

First off, Droopy is incredibly stupid, for no other reason than she HAS to be to advance this dreary plot. The first clue is that she allows Grumpy, who is also scary and creepy, into her life in the first place, after he inappropriately shows up at her philandering husband's funeral and then turns up again at her home and tries to manipulate her to obsess, like he does, about finding out details of their dead spouse's affair (both of whom just died in a plane crash),. Which he does in a weirdly sinister manner, NEVER offering her a sound reason. At this point anyone else would pack up and move, FAST; no goodbyes or forwarding address. Not Droopy. She joins him in Florida, where the plane went down, to help Grumpy dig for information about the ill-fated pair. Despite the brazen stupidity, here, the movie might have improved 10 fold, if there was some twist in the relationship of the the dead spouses -- espionage, embezzlement ANYTHING, thus making it his keen detective instincts (Did I mention he was a detective?) that is fueling his quest for answers-- or even if Grumpy had just been a deluded psychopath, (which is what he seemed to be) instead of just annoyingly obsessive. In fact the relationship between the two is so idiotic, I thought there HAD to be a twist, so I kept waiting for the punch line. No such luck! This incredulous, painfully dull romance was SUPPOSED to be front and center. Adding to the mess, was the script, which was tortuously (sometimes laughably) repetitive.

How Ford pried into the truth of his dead wife's betrayal, how hard Thomas tried to protect her daughter and her career SHOULD HAVE BEEN dealt with subtlety but what I got is only a surface but not 3-D illustration.The director and the editor failed to join, to knit the three lines together, 1) their spouses' affair plus the air crash, 2) Ford's investigation of a cop, 3) Thomas's running for Congress, they are scattered in a random manner!

Pollack also allows us to see both Ford and Scott Thomas at work whereas Lemmon on Mills had left their day jobs behind. Still there are enough similarities for plagiarism to rear its ugly head, so what else is knew. This eluded me on release and I found a Russian version in a Thrift Shop, recognized Scott Thomas on the box, know she always delivers so took it home. I was pleasantly surprised, especially after reading the first few pans here on IMDb.

Worse, you find yourself so far ahead of them that you grow impatient while waiting for them to catch up. They call this situation 'dramatic irony.' More than 30 minutes elapse in Random Hearts before Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas realize that their respective spouses have not only died in a tragic plane crash, but that they also were cheating on them. Sadly, Oscar-winning director Sydney Pollack of Out of Africa and his scenarists&#151;Kurt Luedtke and Daryl Ponicsan--belabor the inevitable, trivialize adultery, and pad the action with two obligatory subplots that interfere with the main romance.Although Warren Adler's novel served as the source material for Random Hearts, this contemporary tale of ill-fated, middle-aged lovers draws inspiration from Sir David Lean's classic, 1945, rainy day soaper Brief Encounter. Unlike Lean's legendary weepie, Random Hearts whirls aimlessly in circles but never seems to go anywhere, chiseling its audience out of any kind of emotional closure with its humdrum ending. Ford and Thomas both radiate celestial Hollywood star power, but their combined wattage cannot energize this comatose two-hour and 13-minute tearjerker.Cast as a District of Columbia cop assigned to Internal Affairs, Ford is appropriately tight-lipped and believably gruff as Sergeant Dutch Van Den Broeck. They call me Dutch&#151;it's easier, he likes to tell people. Dutch busts bad cops, but racking up convictions to earn a long overdue promotion to lieutenant is not his style. He is as content as a police sergeant as he is secure in his marriage to his pretty wife Peyton (Susan Thompson of Ghosts of Mississippi), a catalog designer for Saks Fifth Avenue. Sadly, Dutch lives in a fool's paradise, and the revelations from the plane crash shatter him. Ford is credible as the cuckolded cop, but his short, bristly hairstyle and a gold stud in his ear lobe contradict his blue-collar sensibilities.Thomas plays Kay Chandler, a fastidious, New Hampshire, Republican congresswoman running for reelection against a billionaire opponent with few scruples. Married to well-heeled Washington attorney Cullen (Peter Coyote in a cameo role), Kay adores her 15-year old daughter Jessica (Kate Mara). Obviously, a scandal is the last thing that Kay needs during her re-election bid. When she discovers what her philandering husband has been doing, she keeps the truth from her daughter&#151;and tries to deny it herself. If they find out about your wife, it's gossip, Kay tells Dutch. If they find out about my husband, it's in the newspapers.The recurring question that haunts the characters in the Kurt Out of Africa Luedtke & Daryl The Last Detail Ponicsan screenplay is How deeply can we trust our partners as well as ourselves? The drama in Random Hearts grows out of the troubled relationship that evolved when Dutch shows up at her apartment one day with a series of questions about Cullen. Dutch cannot believe that his wife cheated on him. Obsessively, he must turn over every rock in his search for the truth. Dutch figures Kay must be just as curious. They have a fling while he investigates the untimely death of their spouses. Kay fears Dutch because he cannot leave well enough alone, and the sense of betrayal that Dutch feels threatens his sanity.The people that made Random Hearts had the right idea. Like most classic love stories, the characters share little in common except for their grief and betrayal, and they clash when they first collide. Diametrical opposites always attract in this genre, but the coupling of Kay and Dutch seems more like a screenwriter's conceit than a credible liaison. These characters never win our sympathy because they are too self-absorbed to see what is really happening around them. Further, Dutch and Kay aren't as interesting as their adulterous spouses. You know that a movie is in trouble, too, when forty-five minutes pass before its main characters get together. Luedtke and Ponicsan furnish Ford and Thomas with dialogue that verges on the ridiculous.At one point, before they hop into the sack, Kay says to Dutch I'm not going to make small talk so there won't be any junk between us. Later, Kay observes about herself Nobody knows who I am anymore. While Random Hearts refuses to condone adultery, its sentiments about extramarital affairs seems capricious. During a conversation with one of his late wife's colleagues, Dutch listens as the woman explains how she accidentally caught her own erring husband in bed with another woman. Instead of exposing them, she felt discretion was the better part of fidelity and fled. I kept my mouth shut and I never went home again without calling first, she states.Some of the late Stanley Kubrick must have rubbed off on Pollack. Pollack, if you recall, acted in Kubrick's final film Eyes Wide Shut. Kubrick was known for slowly paced epics. Similarly, Pollack takes great pains to draw out Random Hearts with long, dramatic pauses. The two subplots involving a crooked cop that Dutch is investigating and Kay's reelection campaign add nothing other than an obligatory shoot-out and Pollack himself as a spin doctor moderating Kay's election.Random Hearts emerges as a gorgeous looking but glum melodrama that creeps along with agonizing solemnity before it arbitrarily fades out on a hollow note. Despite its gripping premise and its polished craftsmanship, Random Hearts is still a mopey love story in search of a pulse.

The cool, refined English beauty and the warm-blooded American male -- what could possibly be more lovely? Well, this is not that movie. Right away they ruin it by casting Kristin Scott Thomas as an American Congresswoman. That's like casting Hugh Grant as Babe Ruth. Or Colin Firth as Al Capone. Kristin Scott Thomas is exactly the sort of woman you don't picture shaking hands with greasy ex-junkies in filthy slums, or squeezing into smelly crowds and kissing babies. She would have been far better cast as the English born widow of an aristocratic Senator, the kind who belongs to the hunt club and goes to flower shows but has no idea how the other half lives.Then there's Harrison Ford as a regular guy cop. Certainly he's tough enough for the role. But the idea that he's going to romance this stunning high society beauty is a bit hard to swallow. Why couldn't he have been, say, a tough but wealthy reform politician with blue-collar roots who inherits Kristin's late husband's Senate seat? The two of them are initially quite cool to each other, but for duty's sake Kristin is cordial to him, and he in return starts showing her some of the rawer side of life -- things her husband sheltered her from. Her political awakening coincides with the jolting passion of a newer, more blue collar, lover -- one who appreciates her polish and refinement far more than her aristocratic husband. Now that's a love story! Instead of that, though, you get a blank, meaningless thriller where the action drags and nothing happens. Well, there is one ghetto style drive by scene where Harrison almost gets killed, but it's so abrupt and unexplained it's really more like welcome comic relief.The sky is always gray in this movie, and our refined, lovely Kristin always looks a little chilled. When she's supposed to be dreaming of passion, she looks more like she's dreaming of a wool blanket and a cup of tea! She also looks a bit sleepy most of the time, like she'd really rather be napping in the bed than screwing Harrison Ford.All things considered, I'd say you can't blame her.

Kind of. It makes a half-hearted attempt to have a plot and to have plot mechanics and so on. And just doesn't care at all about any of that stuff, and eventually it all just fades away to nothing. Because the filmmakers don't care at all about the cop's case or his career, any more than they care about the congresswoman's career or her race for re- election, or her relationship with her daughter, or even how each of these people grieves over the loss of their spouses or the betrayal. No, the movie's not about any of that, yet that takes up a good portion of it - so it makes sense that a lot of people would go thumbs down on this.And yet - the movie is really good, if you focus just on what the movie itself cared about in itself, and what it was about at heart. And that is, simply, the two leads, and their relationship. And that's it. The rest of the movie doesn't matter at all to the people making it. But that's OK, because - Ford and Scott Thomas are amazing in this. And have amazing chemistry. And are amazingly written. We love the relationship, we really love the two people in it. We want them to end up together (I won't say if they do or not). Badly. And all the rest is just stuff to justify getting them from point A to point B and having the relationship happen and take the steps it needs to take - and that INCLUDES the entire 'premise' of the film itself, including the plane crash and the situation that opens it. So. As I say, I can see why this would get a fail grade. But it's so involving and the good in it is so good - we care so much about what the filmmakers cared about in the movie - that I can recommend it and could imagine watching it again at some point. Even if only for Kristin Scott Thomas's beautiful face with those big puppy dog eyes that are just - so open and emotional. You can fall in love with her, watching this, much moreso than in The English Patient. Her character here is extremely endearing and adorable - two words I've never used to describe any politician, fictional or otherwise. So perhaps she was miscast. But yea. A lovely woman playing a character you could imagine falling in love with (and do fall in love with, watching the movie), being hurt and having a disaster befall her, being vulnerable, and then meeting and falling for as likable and respectable and endearing a MALE performer as we've ever seen on screen. It's a recipe for success and despite the failed movie surrounding it, I think it was a success.Also of note - film features a young Kate Never Quite Famous Mara in an early role as the congresswoman's daughter. And there's a late scene of plot movement where a subplot crashes hilariously into the main story, in a way that momentarily threatened to be the most ludicrous such subplot intrusion in the history of cinema (narrowly averted, as she didn't take the bullet, thank God).Is the movie plausible, psychologically? No. It's absurd, psychologically. My OnDemand deal had Peter Weir's (brilliant) Fearless as a similar film to this. And superficially, in some plot details, yea I guess they are similar. But the films are nothing at all alike, nor are they about anything similar. The one line towards the end where Scott Thomas tells the press how the cop had been her friend, seen her thru a tough time when she needed it, how they were 'survivors' - all that rings completely hollow and doesn't match the film, which simply depicts a romance. The thing Scott Thomas is talking about at the end there would match the Rosie Perez/Jeff Bridges relationship in Fearless, which was indeed about two survivors of a tragedy using each other's company to cope (or not cope) with a trauma they'd both experienced. But this film isn't about trauma. It sidesteps all of that very quickly and is simply about a romance that, if freed from the requirements of psychological plausibility and the plot, is quite good. So. If you still are interested in seeing a nice and involving romance, despite all those many caveats - check it out.

Neither of them were particularly likeable, and I never saw any chemistry between them. Dutch seemed to fall in love because he wanted to get back at his wife. Kay seemed to fall for Dutch, but we don't know why she fell for Dutch. There was nothing that showed why these two would care about each other, except for the fact that their spouses were having an affair. To me, that isn't reason enough to center a whole film around. So, the writer and director threw in a couple of side stories. Dutch with his investigation of another cop, and Kay with her re-election bid. Neither of these secondary stories had anything to do with anything. It was like they were thrown in there just to make the movie longer. Or because the director realized that the relationship between Dutch and Kay couldn't sustain an entire movie. Which, of course, was true. However the secondary story lines were badly done. The re-election campaign and Kay's relationship with her daughter were shown, but not played out. That story line wasn't too bad, especially compared to Dutch's secondary story. He's on the ass of this cop who has been shaking down people for money. So this cop decides to kill Dutch. In broad daylight. In a driveby shooting. In front of other people. Now c'mon. Am we supposed to really believe this would happen? And what purpose did it serve? None that I could see. Random Hearts was an unnecessary movie. The plot line wasn't strong enough to hold together a whole movie. And the secondary stories were illogical and at times just plain stupid. The only thing about this movie that was good was the fact that Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas were in it. Two fine actors, in two lousy roles. And is it just me, or did some of the music sound like it came straight from the Rocky movies?

Harrison Ford plays 'Dutch' an underachieving Internal Affairs police officer. He figures out that his wife's life and death in the airline accident is not what he thought. This shakes him up and he becomes crazed and obsessed.  He intrudes into the Congresswoman's life to follow his craving to understand his dead wife's actions with the Congresswoman's husband.  A side line of the movie provides some action as Dutch tries to bust a rotten cop.  People do unbelievable, out of character things in this story.

I've read interviews where he expresses his general lack of enthusiasm for the art of movie making (the guy admitted he's never seen Casablanca!), and IMHO this lack of enthusiasm has been written all over his work for several years now. He only makes a film every year or so, so you'd think he'd save his energy for truly interesting roles; yet he chooses to stand around in movies like this, Six Days, Seven Nights and Sabrina? He doesn't need the money (he's starred in some of the most profitable movies of all time), so why not just spare us all? I miss his wry smile, and I'd even welcome efforts to play against type. Intense and brooding is one thing, but stony and bored (and boring) is another.What was everyone involved thinking, first, when they saw the daily rushes devoid of any passion or chemistry; then, later, when the whole thing ran for over two hours? This is the kind of going-through-the-motions film making that, unfortunately, Hollywood feels the need to thrust upon us to fill all those billion-a-plexes and take up cable air-time.But it is passable as cable tv diversion, and I do just love the sound of Ford's voice, no matter what silly lines he's forced or chooses to utter!

You do your job (arrest people, in this case), drink a beer at the bar and decide to call your wife. She left a message on the machine, saying that she had to go into a trip with her agency. The TV is showing a plane crash, and your wife may have taken the plane. Her name is not on the list, but you don't have any idea of what happened to her. You go to her job place, make questions about her trip and find out that she didn't travel for job. You know that she was on that plane, but one idea comes to your mind she was cheating you with another man. You have mixed feelings, of sadness and hate, and finally finds out that she was traveling with another name, with another man sit by her side. The man is the husband of a famous politician, who is on her campaign to the congress. You meet each other and then the situation gets even worse, right? Unfortunately not.RANDOM HEARTS does the impossible turn all those great ideas and an interesting set up into a bad film. Not just bad, but also dull, monotonous, turtle-paced and boring. It lasts 2 hours and 10 minutes, but this running time seems an eternity. I'll compare this with a common situation on the big cities you wait for a bus at the bus stop. You wait, wait, but it never comes. At one moment, you just give up. RANDOM HEARTS is this bus. It's distant, distant, and never shows why it was made. There is not a real climax, unless you consider that Harrison Ford taking a shot and then recovering is a climax. I put the spoiler warning on the beginning, because it is needed on the IMDb and I respect it. But in a film like RANDOM HEARTS telling the end is not spoiling, because nothing happens.Director Sidney Pollack, who has a supporting role on the picture, doesn't show the value of the Oscar he won for OUT OF AFRICA. I never loved that film, but it is certainly much better than RANDOM HEARTS. Here he uses a very slow pace to develop the characters slowly and get into their feelings, but he never succeeds. The film has a big problem it is emotionally distant. The first half is interesting and even a little mysterious and intriguing. But the second half, when we should expect something even better, it is almost unbearable. Sentimental, dull, empty. Maybe this emptiness of the characters is not really an emptiness. I think it's because they are distant and uninteresting, and the leading actors may be the blamed for that. Some critics said that Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas saved the film, but in my opinion it's just the opposite. Ford has one of his worst performances as Dutch. He doesn't show emotions and has a face of eternal bad mood. Thomas is sometimes irritating as Kay. She is a good actress, but her character is bland. A pity. After a supporting role in the intelligent English comedy FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL and an Oscar nod for the 9 Academy Award winner THE English PATIENT, Ms. Thomas took the same way that stars once Oscar nominated or even Oscar winner (Marisa Tomei, Mira Sorvino, Nicolas Cage, just to name a few recent ones) did. The annoying melodrama THE HORSE WHISPERER (with a story similar to RANDOM HEARTS) proved that she took the very wrong way. And this film proves that again. At least she doesn't have the Academy Award at home to increase her decadence.RANDOM HEARTS has more problems, especially a terrible sub-plot about murder, which Ford investigates. Much of this could have been cut at the editing room, so that it would be a shorter film.I do not recommend the show, but give it a 44 out of 100 and a D+, because the beginning was interesting and the film itself is not what I would call unwatchable.

I stayed with it because I like Miss Scott - Thomas,but my fidelity was sorely strained by her Hilary Clinton hairstyle and her accent which was cleverly sustained,but to what purpose?If you're going to employ an English actress why make her speak American?Beats me. The first half - hour was so slow and loaded with so many shots of an air crash that even the dimmest viewer would have cottoned on that something unexpected was on the cards. So I was less than dumbfounded to discover that Miss Scott - Thomas's husband and Mr Ford's wife - passengers on the crashed plane - had a little something going on.Albeit somewhat relieved that at last something was happening in the movie. Presumably to pad the story out there was a sub - plot (completely irrelevant and frankly,uninteresting) about Mr Ford's work as a cop in Internal Affairs.The only possible point was to prove that Mr Ford was not a racist.....but nobody ever said he was in the first place unless I dozed off and missed it. Eventually Mr Ford and Miss Scott - Thomas get it on together and that - you might think - is that,but no,there are a number of false climaxes(if you will pardon the expression)before the movie eventually passes away peacefully in its sleep,leaving,like a hand removed from a bowl of water,nary a trace.

You may think this is a terrible analogy, but you have to understand what an icon he was in this country not to mention Edmonton.  For an American to put it into perspective, try thinking of Babe Ruth, for a Brit, think of the queen saying the F-word in public, for a... well you get the point.  It was the same scenario.  So to say it's a shock that Harrison Ford has made a bad film is a bit of an exageration, but it is still somewhat of a surprise.  I have never not enjoyed one of his films.  Even his somewhat mediocre films like Blade Runner and Six Days Seven Nights were pretty darn good and I enjoyed them.  But this film, this Random Hearts is so slow and trite and uncomfortable that I really thought I was going to leave the theater.  Half way through it I actually went to the concession stand to get some nachos and pop ( here in Ontario Famous Players no longer sells M&M's, they are onto other cheap imitations of peanuts and chocolate, and I am not happy about it, so I now eat nachos and salsa, so I'll be going to Cineplex Odeon more than before, just in case you care ) and that is almost sacriligious to leave the theater once it has started but here I didn't mind because not only was I hungry but I was bored.The problems that I had with Random Hearts are numerous, but  let's start with the obvious.  Where was the emotion?  I know Harrison Ford has made a career of being the stoic, somewhat emotionless, poker-faced, virile man that faces danger and despair like John Wayne, but come on, no tears?  His wife just died in a plane crash and she was having an affair that he didn't know about.  That's a lot to deal with, I think the writer could have allotted one scene of emotion.  I would have appreciated one scene where Indy shows that he is human and breaks down in the privacy of his own space and lets it all out.  He did that in Presumed Innocent and that was just for a person that he was having an affair with.  This was his wife!  But all we get is an obsessed man looking for clues as to why it happened.  But for me to care about this character the way I should have requires him to be real and to show me that he really did care for his wife and that her death is hurting him.  There were also way too many scenes drawn out in the film that were done for dramatic effect instead of honesty.  Sometimes when people have important converstations, there isn't a dramatic pause and then we cut to another day and another scene.  Usually when two people are talking about something serious the way Ford and Thomas were they would have a deep conversation with substance and meaning, but instead we are cheated out of any good dramatics and it is substituted with a blank stare and no conversation and then we are left wondering what happened.  And this becomes frustrating. Another big problem with the film is the chemistry  between the two leads.  Harrison and Kristen did not seem to be as into each other as you need to believe they are.  I found more energy and raw sexual tension between Indy and Marion and even Ford and Heche in Six Days..... Their relationship seems more because they are written that way than believing that they are truly in love with each other.  We all know that a film has writers and directors and cameramen and boom people and gaffers and so on, but a film works best you can't detect the presence of the writer and the director and so on.  Random Hearts suffers from that very problem.  The writer seemed very present to me and that takes away from the cinematic experience.  And I'm not even going to mention the subplot of Ford trying to bring down a ruthless and dirty cop ( it really doesn't fit in this film at all ).As I said at the beginning.  Anything is possible.  But there are just a few things in life that seem sacred.  Remember how you felt when you hit that age and you found out that Santa Clause was just.... well you know.  Well that is how I feel right now.  I didn't think it was possible but now that it happened I have to admit that it was probably just a matter of time.  All good things come to an end.  Harrison Ford has been entertaining us for so long that you almost take for granted how great of an actor he is and how much of an asset he is to our film going lives.  He is constantly entertaining us whether it's as a man being chased by Sam Girard, the president of the United States, a space cowboy or as a guy that wears a fedora, hangs out with a guy named Short Round, had an enemy named Belloq and doesn't know how to speak Hovitos, I'd say one terrible movie in 25 years is okay.  I just really hope that the next one does reunite him with Steven and George, until then, avoid this one.

Harrison Ford is amazing as always, and is amazing here, he is very sympathetic in my opinion, very likable, and while at times i questioned his choices, i stuck with him, as i rooted for him, it also helped that he had wonderful chemistry with Kristin Scott Thomas, was as always very intense, fantastic in the acting department and was just amazing overall! (Ford Rules!!!!!!). Kristin Scott Thomas is also amazing here, she is extremely likable, beautiful, had wonderful chemistry with Ford, is a very charming woman, and i felt sorry for her character, she was amazing!

Bonnie Hunt is wasted here and has barely anything to do,she is a great actress and deserved a better part!. Kate Mara is extremely cute and did wonderful in her scenes as the daughter i just wished she had more!. Sydney Pollack is great in his role, and proves he can act as well as direct!. Dennis Haysbert(George),Richard Jenkins(Truman Trainor),Paul Guilfoyle(Dick Montoya),Susanna Thompson(Peyton Van Den Broeck),Peter Coyote(Cullen Chandler and Susan Floyd(Molly Roll) all do what they have to do extremely well.

All his colleagues and friends are sympathetic but as Ford pushes beyond the limits of the envelope, they withdraw their support. There's no controlling Ford's morbid determination.In this movie, Harrison Ford discovers that his wife was killed in an airplane crash, seated next to the married man she was having an affair with, both on their way to a secret holiday in Miami. Harrison Ford is in thrall to a grim determination to find out all he can about the affair -- the hotel room they used in Miami, the rendezvous point in Washington, the night clubs they went to, the gifts they gave each other. It makes little sense because we haven't seen Ford and his wife happy together. If Glenn Ford was driven half crazy by grief, enough to lose his job, Harrison Ford lacks that compelling motive, although he too loses his job.Along the way he discovers Kristen Scott Thomas, the betrayed wife of the man who was cuckolding him. She's in Congress and can't afford the publicity of having the affair made public. They're at odds with each other. He wants to know all the details while she's stoic and wants to put the whole ordeal behind her. Of course Ford and Thomas have an affair.Is there anything beneath this sappy love story besides the romantic musical score? It has holes -- major and minor -- in the plot. Minor Thomas' daughter, Jessica, is in Andover, a prep school, described as forty miles from Washington, although Phillips Andover Academy is in Massachusetts, 25 miles north of Boston.Major While Ford and Thomas hardly know one another, and she's been icy towards him, they fall into a desperate and strenuous clinch in a car and he apparently brings her off in ten seconds.Well, that's rather intermediate than major, because it adumbrates the affair that begins soon after. But here's another major flaw The last politician to be actually damaged by a divorce or revelation of a wandering spouse was Nelson Rockefeller in 1964. Granted that the press has turned far more tabloid in its sensibilities since then, the fact that one's father has been shacking up on weekends isn't really enough to make sophisticated, sixteen-year-old Jessica drop a plate on the floor in shock. Now if he'd been a serial killer -- There is a sub-theme that has Ford, in Internal Affairs, trying to nail an errant cop. It belongs in an action movie. It seems to have little to do with the developing romance.The performances are okay. Harrison Ford looks glum throughout, wears a hangdog expression, and when he parts for the last time with Thomas he tries to smile openly for the first time and one hears the creak of long-unused facial muscles. Thomas, on the other hand, is more animated. She's quite pretty, her aquiline schnozz notwithstanding. She's appealing -- pale, fragile, wide-eyed -- and from some angles resembles Marlene Dietrich except for von Sternberg's lighting and that thin but prominent nose.But it's mostly a confusing mess. I had no idea where the movie was headed. That's okay because I sometimes get derailed. What was troubling was that I couldn't be at all sure that the writers knew what they were about either.

What's worse, Harrison Ford, as Van den broeck, appears to be in this somnambulistic state throughout the entire movie. Perhaps the best display of this torpor that Ford walks around in is when he is identifying the body of his wife, for legal purposes, after the crash. Ford shows almost no response, and I, therefore, thought that it was not his wife.Kristen Scott Thomas (as Kay Chandler) exhibits so little emotion that (I think inadvertently), some would wonder if she was behind her husband's death. At her first public appearance after that death (at a political fundraiser), she says Thank you all for your friendship and support and don't leave without letting me talk to each one of you. Very shallow, false, almost like cardboard.Not only is Van den broeck's demeanor stupid (as in a stupor), he actually acts creepy. The first time he visits Chandler, to talk about what he assumes is a tryst between their former spouses, he acts so troubled, psychologically, that when Chandler's 15 year old daughter comes home, and is at the door, if I were she, I would have run with her out the door and called the police (one of which, Van Den Broeck is one).I could have forgiven all of this (some people just don't easily, or ever, display emotion), and given this movie a 7, which to me is a grading of not great, but OK, but I downgraded it to a 6, because of the impertinent scenes regarding Van Den Broeck's investigation of another cop. Note to screenwriter Kurt Luedtke If you are going to write disparate scenes, make two different movies. In summary, it is torture to watch Harrison Ford mumble and amble his way through a performance that could have been either electrifying or heart-rendering.

There isn't even a possibility of divorce. So what's the point of the movie.I guess the point is for these two leads to work out their anger and their loss together. It is just so slow with the jazzy trumpets and soft piano. Sydney Pollack thinks this is more profound that it actually is. The two leads have no chemistry. Harrison Ford is horribly cold. The romance is nothing more than melodrama. His police investigation is nothing but a sideshow. I would have more respect for the movie if Dutch goes ahead and shoots the suspect. If this movie is about Kay and only about Kay, the story has a little bit of potential. There is a bit more on her side with her daughter and political ramifications.

As a vehicle for a tragedy-hemmed romance between two striking, middle-aged actors Random Hearts works satisfactorily. Dutch and Kay spend the film trying to deny their partners' infidelity, their own neediness, the actual possibility of romance between them given their previous monogamy; the supression is meant to cook the ardor and often functions in this way.However the film is far too long to sustain this rather simple conceit and the will-they-won't-they, guilt/passion see-sawing of the romance makes one a little frustrated if not seasick. Although this is really Harrison Ford's film as he pursues the truth, be it of his wife in death or his new inamorata in life, once again I find myself in admiration of Scott-Thomas. Her naturally English temper, alluring, inscrutable but liable to crack is carefully tailored to this film and works a treat.

If your wife or husband died in their prime in a plane crash, would you go into an investigative mode after you suspected your partner was having an affair?I suppose that would depend on the relationship preceding the accident.  I think I'd be a little more upset about a spouse's death than the infidelity.  It would bother me but my first thought would be that a person I had loved was gone.So there's the starting point and we have a very dour Harrison Ford (who cracks half-a-smile through the whole film) and a very vital Kristin Scott Thomas as the surviving partners.Another approach--rather than Ford's bullish investigative tactics into what happened--might have been the fact that a drug lord that Ford is seeking to put away was on the same plane.  The drug guy was assassinated through a bomb placed on the plane.  In my movie, the bomb explodes over the water so there are no bodies.  Meanwhile, Ford's wife just disappears--no one knows where she is.Through that investigation of the accident, Ford finds some clue that his wife may have been aboard the ill-fated flight.  Similarly, Thomas is trying to track down her husband and has gotten hooked up with Ford somehow.  Some unusual similarities pop up on the two cases--Ford notices that both were in Florida on the same day twice before that year.The two feel an attraction--while searching for their mates.  At film's end, they uncover the affair but, by this time, are able to help each other handle the crisis.

Partly this is caused by a script which lacks a nerve and something to tie all the pieces together and give us a satisfactory ending. But most importantly, what really makes this movie a crappy one is Harrison Ford. There are two categories of actors; the one that makes a movie and the one that is made by the movie. Ford falls into the latter category. I don't think he's a very good actor, and an over-prized one at that. He has the charm of a lug. The one thing that is positive about this movie is Kristin Scott Thomas, though. She is brilliant, as always.

Kay Chandler, a republican congresswoman finds out her husband was on the plane. Sgt. Van Den Broeck, a policeman who's name is so foreign his colleagues call him 'Dutch', discovers his wife Peyton died sitting next to Mr. Chandler, travelling as his wife. The grief of losing his beautiful, loving wife is combined with the dent to his ego from being made a cuckold, posthumously.Obsessed with finding out what drove his wife to infidelity, he tracks down the congresswoman, and seduces her. But their affair is disturbed by the jealous memory of the dead lovers, of the lie that all four had been living before the crash. The byline reads In a perfect world they never would have met. In a perfect world filmmakers would think twice before embarking on adaptations of bad 80s novels, especially when they lack irony. This adaptation has the emotional realism and grittiness common to the NY film scene, but it is weighed down by too much plot, too many chapters and too much character which has to be condensed into 131 minutes. The result is an acceleration of narrative events that makes the relationship between Dutch and Kay improbably intense and unstable.The ground covered by the film means its 131 minutes felt like three hours to the audience, who began laughing at all the wrong things, even groaning in disbelief as the chapters rolled on. But many of them were there because they'd been given free passes, and were seeking entertainment, not an extended exploration of a grief-stricken relationship. The film has some interesting elements, such as the class conflict between Kay, who got elected to Congress because her dad was famous, and Dutch, the paranoid internal affairs policeman who can't believe his wife got bored and fell for a toff who paid for regular first class trips to their Miami lovenest. There is an unusually raw, honest quality to the script, which has some tense exchanges full of wit and wounding unsophistication, but which is also padded out with inane smalltalk. The film relies too heavily on words to entertain its audience, and the only available subplot is Dutch's run-in with a corrupt cop, which proves so distractingly stupid and violent it cripples the entire movie, combining the high concept of the cop drama and airplane disaster, with the interior drama of two confused lovers. There was a palpable draining of interest from the cinema after Dutch and Kay's repressed sexuality erupts in a violent grope-session in the airport carpark. It seems letting a middle-aged couple engage in teenage sex is taking cinema one base too far for Australia's multiplex audiences. From then on, the audience's primary interest seemed to be What time is it?Random Hearts suffers for its complex 'adult' concept - it fails to generate the appropriate audience expectations. It strives for a truthfulness that endangers its place on the romantic comedy shelf, and it attempts an intrusive action-based subplot that confuses the audience by stripping the film of any romance it had. Whilst it makes some bold political and moral statements, overall the film is a weak adaptation that lacks emotional integrity and popular characters. Pollack has honourable intentions, but the best he can do is go down swinging. His movie will translate better on the smallscreen when viewers can walk away from the parts they don't like to make some coffee, relieve themselves, even engage in some nooky themselves, before coming back to catch up with the plot. It's a mixed-up movie about a mixed-up world that should have been serialised and syndicated for the entertainment of bored housewives; not developed into a serious screenplay with multiplexes in mind.

"},{"Title":"Lost in Lumet Land","Date":"2 August 2003","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery, Romance","Review":"  There are few redeeming features to this plotless, suspenseless, badly written piece of garbage where everyone is a jerk.Two middle aged people (Harrison Ford, Kristin Scott Thomas) are seemingly happily married. Except, their spouses are having an affair with each other. Through some twist of faith, their spouses airplane crashes. And I guess that's it, really. The rest of the movie is spent watching the stars have their little emotional hallmark moments, when he finds out, then she finds out, then her daughter finds out (really). Ford then sets off on some quest to find what really happened, but don't worry, he doesn't find out anything. Because it is already plain as day what happened. They crashed. However, Ford's trek to their better half's little getaway hotel in Miami gives the movie a blunt device to get Ford and Thomas away to Miami too. Watch them look on in shocked bewilderment as Spanish people perform strange mating rituals in the middle of the street, obviously perplexed and in shock at the down and out quality the scriptwriting. By the time they get back, F & T of course are obliged to have their own little encounter. Just because they had an affair, we're supposed to have one too?!?, cries Thomas. She might have been addressing the director. What follows looks like a cross between a kickboxing match and lovemaking in a rather cramped car.  There is also a silly subplot with a corrupt cop (Ford is supposed to be a DC internal affairs detective), but that plot has nothing to do with the main story and doesn't go anywhere. Thomas' congress woman subplot doesn't go anywhere either.The only point of interest in this 1999 movie, is that two of the small characters also appear in the tv series 24.None of the subplots go anywhere. Everyone's a jerk. The writing is abysmal.In short, avoid this piece of gunk like the plague, unless you're a hardcore romance junkie or fan of Harrison Ford or Kristin Scott Thomas. In a perfect world, they would have never met. Truer words, etc. "},{"Title":"There are made-for -TV works much better than this!","Date":"8 September 2002","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery, Romance","Review":"  To think that Sidney Pollack is the director who gave us such works as they shoot horses don't they?

When the plane crashes he is told that no one of that name was on the plane.  He investigates further and finds that she was on the plane as someone else's wife.  He finds the wife of the man his wife was having an affair with in order to try and find out more &#150; but they end up with a relationship.  Meanwhile Dutch's frustration at the deceit in his life begins to affect his work.The film opens slowly with the crash never seen, but instead we see a calm and cool Dutch catching a dirty cop while his wife and her lover lie die in a plane wreck.  The film takes a worthy plot from then on and follows Dutch as he tries to find out how much of his marriage was a lie.  He does this by seeking out the history of his wife and her lover and meeting with her lover's wife, Kay Chandler.  The affair that blossoms between them is interesting as it comes out of pain but grows into more.  The better element is watching Dutch change into a more aggressive, frustrated man &#150; although the `dirty cop' subplot they use to show this isn't very well inserted into the narrative.  Overall I couldn't say the plot was unworthy or uninteresting at heart.However the delivery kills it.  The film is so very badly paced that at times it feels like time itself has literally stopped and is beginning to turn backwards on itself!  So little happens for whole runs of the film that you wonder if the editors just plain forgot to take it out of the final version.  It's a shame because it's a good plot but the running time and lack of anything to capture my interest on a scene by scene basis made for very dull viewing.The cast give the film a very professional and glossy feel &#150; like having a limousine!  Sadly this limousine only has first gear and doesn't go anywhere.  Ford is strong and changes his character well.  However Thomas has a thankless job of not revealing much of her character and hence appearing dull.  The support cast is full of good actors (or ell know ones anyway), Hunt, Dutton, Haysbert, Coyote, Guilfoyle and Pollack himself.Overall this is a worthy film that feels heavy and serious.  It's not that the plot is boring in itself but really the pacing and lack of anything interesting happening really drags the film down.  This could easily have lost 30 minutes and still delivered the same story with no felling of being rushed.

It seems as though every movie he touches turns to gold. But even Harrison makes a mistake once in a while. He should never have agreed to take this role.Once Harrison's character figures out the truth about the airplane crash, the plot comes to a screeching halt. There is nowhere else to go. And this happens within...what? 25 minutes? After that, it's just a long, long movie.Oh, how I wish Harrison would have had an ark to find!

Or perhaps I wish I'd known something about who the writers were. Because this was about as bad as a Hollywood movie can get. Every cliché you can think of, and all of them put in the most obvious places.I can sort of see how it managed to attract the sort of money that's needed to make a Hollywood movie with that sort of star power, because if you take the elements one by one, all of them would sound OK. It's just that they were put together in a manner that makes no sense whatsoever.It's a waste of 131 minutes. "}]
