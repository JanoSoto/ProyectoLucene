[{"Title":"Quasi-realism and burlesque a comedic drama","Date":"7 February 2004","Score":"61 out of 76 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, War","Review":" There was surprisingly enough a lot of humor in the American attitude toward the Nazis and the Germans during World War II. Life goes on even under the conditions of being prisoners of war, and people need to laugh. In such circumstances, they especially need to laugh. We can see that in some of the songs from that time and in this play from Donald Bevant and Edmund Trzcinski that Billy Wilder made into an unusually good movie. It should be realized that the full extent of the horror that the Nazis had visited upon Europe was not known until after the war was over and we saw the films of the concentration camps.William Holden stars as Sgt J.J. Sefton whose amoral cynicism and gift for the cheap hustle allow him to feather his nest even while a prisoner of war.He's the guy who always had a storehouse of cigarettes, booze, silk stockings, candy, etc. under his bunk, the guy who always won at cards, whose proposition bets always gave him the edge. We had a guy like that when I was in the army. We called him Slick.But William Holden's Sefton is more than Slick. He is outrageously cynical and uncommonly brave. He takes chances because he doesn't have the same kind of fear that others have. Most people would feel self-conscious (and nervous) eating a fried egg while everybody else in the barracks had watery-thin potato soup. Others might feel uncomfortable with bribing German guards for bottles of Riesling or tins of sardines. Not Sefton. He flaunts his store of goodies.Perhaps that is overdone. Perhaps the real hardships that prisoners went through are glossed over in this comedic drama--a comedy, incidentally, that plays very much like a Broadway musical without the music. Perhaps it is the case that from the distance of 1953 the deprivations of Stalag 17 have faded from memory and it is the good times that are recalled.At any rate, I think it is this kind of psychology that accounts for the success of this unusual blend of quasi-realism and burlesque. Certainly Stalag 17 has been widely imitated, most familiarly in the TV sit-com Hogan's Heroes and to some extent on Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In. Roberto Benigni's Life Is Beautiful, on the other hand, which also finds humor in the horrific, is of a different genre. Like Ionesco's Rhinoceros, Benigni's movie is from the theater of the absurd, not the Broadway stage.Holden won an Oscar for his performance and Robert Strauss who played Animal was nominated in a supporting role. Otto Preminger, the legendary director and producer, was excellent as the two-faced Col Von Scherbach, the ex-calvary commander and camp commandant who can only take a phone call from the high command with his boots on so he can click his heels. I also liked Sig Rumann as Sgt Johann Sebastian Schulz (always making with the jokes, you Americans) whose previous career as a wrestler in the US accounts for his English-language skills. Gil Stratton, who for years did the sports for CBS Channel 2 in Los Angeles, is interesting as Sefton's sidekick and funky.Indeed, what is responsible for the success of this movie as much as anything is this fine cast playing well-defined character roles. By the way, Strauss and Harvey Lembeck (Sugar Lips Shapiro) were reprising their roles from Broadway.Important is the fine plot line in which Sefton is accused of being a spy for the Nazis while the real spy is exposed step by step. At first we don't know who it is, and then we do, and then the prisoners find out. This should be compared with Sunset Boulevard (1950). While very different movies they have similar elements which reveal part of the psyche and methods of director Billy Wilder. First there is the anti-hero as the protagonist, in both cases played by William Holden. Then there is a lot of the old Hollywood crowd appearing in both films including directors appearing as actors, Erich von Stroheim (not to mention Cecil B. DeMille in his memorable cameo as himself) in Sunset Boulevard, and Otto Preminger here. Sig Rumann has over a 100 credits going back to at least the early thirties. Finally there is the discordant mix of comedic and dramatic elements, a mix that works on our psyches because life is to some very real extent filled with tragedy in close congruence with the laughable.But see this for William Holden who was the kind of actor who was best playing a compromised character as here and as the failed writer/reluctant gigolo in Sunset Boulevard, an actor who drank too much and tended to undistinguished, but when carefully directed could rise above his intentions and give a sterling performance.(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

The scripting is a perfect example of how to marry a tight plot with sharp dialogue and great characters, and the acting is flawless on all counts. While William Holden's performance as the cynical American sergeant rightly won him an Oscar, it is the comic antics of Robert Strauss and Harvey Lembeck that steal the show. And if there was ever a more entertaining ensemble of previously unseen (and sadly subsequently unheard of) supporting players - with the possible exception of Casablanca - I would love to see it. This film predates the more famous WWII pow film The Great Escape by more than a decade, but had Wilder, Holden and company not caused havoc in Stalag 17, the world would never have seen Steve McQueen play the cooler king with such wry aplomb. Stalag 17 is easily one of the finest films of its time, if not of all time, and I would encourage anyone who has never experienced its unique blend of cynicism, comedy, suspense and drama to check it out at the earliest available opportunity.

You see, despite Holden's character Sgt. J.J. Sefton being the film's main character, he is only seen through the eyes of his fellow POWs, rarely ever alone.  When they start to think he's the spy so do we.  Oh, sure, we know he isn't the rat (movies don't do things like that), but since the story is told by all of the POWs who think Sefton is the rat, we start to think like them too.  That is the mastery of Billy Wilder's `Stalag 17', it takes the film's most interesting character and sets him apart from the rest for most of the film, letting us learn about him as the characters do.The story focuses on a group of POWs living in the American section of Stalag 17, supposedly the     's best POW camp.  Among them are barracks chief Hoffy (Richard Erdman), Price (Peter Graves), Shapiro (Harvey Lembeck) and Animal Casava (Robert Strauss).  They all have their own special job when their fellow prisoners try to escape, Price, for instance, is &#145;security'.  The film starts when two prisoners try to escape the barracks.  Everyone inside is enthused, thinking the two will make it very far, except Sefton, who bets precious cigarettes that they wont make it past the outer forest.  When he turns out to be right the POWs start thinking there's a rat and that rat is Sefton.  And as the first hour passes we think so too, it's only logical, Sefton has any luxuries because of his deals with the     s.The POWs start to bully Sefton, and once they beat him to a pulp he decides to discover who the real rat is (at this point, of course, we know he is         ).  His investigation isn't handled with dialogue though, we get this by seeing his facial expressions and his lurking in the shadows of the barracks.So, what starts as a light, `gung-ho' type war movie (there's lots of comedy in the first hour) turns into a dark, sort of gritty thriller with a twist that left me with my mouth open.  I wont reveal it, but I'll just say that Sefton smartly solves the mystery and redeems himself to the rest of the barracks (I didn't spoil anything, come on, it's expected).As I said, there's lots of comedy in the first hour and some in the second, mostly from Strauss and Lembeck's characters.  Some of the comedy is key in showing how these characters cope with their nearly hopeless situation, handled well by Wilder and the actors (Strauss' performance even gained him an Oscar nomination) but some of it just seems tacked on and out of place, like when a drunken Strauss thinks that Lembeck is a             hell.But that is a small qualm, and the rest of the film is excellent.  The direction and writing are great in showing us a war film, a mystery, a thriller and a dark comedy all at once.  I'd have to say I like the acting the most though, Holden (who won a leading Oscar for his work in this) is suave and charming, as well as mischievous and cynical, he creates a real `cool' character without trying too.  And the rest of the cast - Graves, Otto Preminger - are admirable as well.  The POWs aren't clich√©s or caricatures, they're all their own separate people.`Stalag 17' is great as a war movie, a mystery, a thriller and a dark comedy.  It's a classic film, for all who appreciate good cinema, 8.5/10.

The acting is superb, the dialogue quick, the plot unexpected. The film seems fresh and subtle compared to Hollywood films of now. Perhaps this is because the special effects are simple; the emphasis is on dialogue. We also watch for clues in the changing surroundings and the characters in the shadows.I held my breath for the last few minutes. Even after the movie had ended, I wondered What will happen now? Will the guards burst into the barrack? What will happen the next morning? The last seconds of the film are peaceful, but the whistling at the end seems too hopeful...surely something will go still wrong!

It is a fine combination of drama and comic relief that stands up very well against anything else of its type. The setting and atmosphere are quite believable, and they make it easy to enter the characters' world.The opening sequence sets up everything nicely, with most of POW's helping two of the prisoners in an escape attempt, while William Holden as the cynical Sefton separates himself from the rest. Sefton is interesting enough as it is, a man who simply by remaining true to his nature cannot help arousing suspicion and antagonism, and Holden was quite a good choice to play him. The story builds up nicely, with developments coming at a careful pace, and some good stretches of lighter material.There are numerous interesting characters and good performances among the other prisoners, and in particular Robert Strauss and Harvey Lembeck steal more than one scene with their antics which, though goofy, are also an appropriate complement to the main plot and the setting. The German characters are more stylized, but both Sig Ruman and Otto Preminger make them come to life, and help them fit in seamlessly with the others.Billy Wilder's direction and the photography also deserve praise. Besides the way that each sequence fits together so nicely with the others, there are several individual scenes and shots that are done in an impressive fashion - not flashy, but creative and thoughtful. The scene with Holden lying on his cot while most of the others sing and celebrate is one particularly good example. There is a wealth of good material throughout, making Stalag 17 a classic that has lost nothing over the years, and one that can be seen and enjoyed several times.

First of all, William Holden's performance in this film gives this film a very big lead against many other films like it.  Holden is a very good actor given a very good role here as Sefton, a soldier that uniquely accepts his situation.  The other supporting, and even prominent roles are good but seems intentionally underdeveloped for the benefit of not complicating viewers with unnecessary information.  The story, consisting of a whodunit plot, wartime ordeals, and amusing dialogue between the characters is superb for it's time.  All in all, watching Stalag 17 is at least a fine way to spend your time.  I've read many reviews that say that they were disappointed with this film.  Some were annoyed because it wasn't as realistically gritty and tense like Saving Private Ryan.  Well, that's the effect of the Hays Offices (censorship officials of American produced movies during the past).  I have to say that although it may have lacked the grittiness of Spielberg's film, it still surpasses Saving Private Ryan for it's honest approach to it's characters such as the POW that responds to his wife's letter (I believe it.) with a certain kind of feeling that can truly be described as honest and the German Wake up caller Scherbach's constant joking around with POWs while remaining true to his kommandant's wishes.  The 'Animal' and Shapiro characters were obviously created for comic relief but it should only be taken as that, comic relief (Hell, everyone's a comedian and at least they tried).  Most anybody that was disappointed with this film were probably disappointed for it's strange association with the TV show Hogan's Heroes.  I must say that I don't care much for that certain show but I do like this film.  I really don't think that any film should ever be compared with another film or a TV show (unless it's a spinoff, then they're just asking for it) no matter how related they are.  A movie is a movie on it's own and never with the help of another, no matter the similarities.  This is a classic film, worthy of it's praise yet unworthy of it's negative critique.  Nobody should let personal opinions be considered flaws.  Just watch it, when you have the chance, with an open mind.

Here we have a cast of characters, and the undercurrent is 'who's the rat?' in a bunker as the secrets shuffled around (i.e. that there's a tunnel for escape) and the Germans know right away. There's fun in that, and in being able to 2nd guess who the informant really is- at one point I thought the old adage it's the quiet ones you got to watch would come forward- but Wilder is brilliant at transforming this as some solid suspense and dramatic tension while ALSO making a really snappy (sometimes) dark comedy. It's a movie about personality, despite the plot being somewhat important, and with the actors themselves delivering a lot for the characters' sakes.William Holden is the first given attribute as the star, playing the sort who, for a conventional movie-goer audience, seems easy to peg too full of himself, sneaky, has the motive to be the informant. But as the layers come into focus, he's more than meets the eye, and Holden (against his better instincts, as he didn't want the role originally) fills it in with his subtle swagger and great sarcastic touch carried over from Sunset Blvd. Then there's Otto Premminger, a big surprise as he is mostly known as a director, as the Commandant, taking up and stealing every scene he's in (only Erich von Stroheim in Grand Illusion beats him out as tour-de-force Commandants). Then there's supporting work from the desperate 'clowns' (Robert Strauss's Betty Grable obsessed Animal and Harvey Lembeck's Shapiro), and the cool Don Talyer in a turn as Dunbar. They're all at their best.While it almost appears to be more entertaining than it perhaps should- considering, as Cookie's opening narration says, movies about the army have been glamorized and this story is different- it's kind of like the Hollywood 50s answer to something like A Man Escaped. Bresson's film is cold and detached and immediate in dramatic impact, while Stalag 17 wants to be a big hit. There's a lot of humor, some unexpected, some that are meant to be big laughs (i.e. Animal and Shapiro's scheme to get into the Russian prison), and they all connect. It's simply a really entertaining movie that has transcended its period, thanks to Wilder's faith in (and more than likely proponent of) an ironic, witty sensibility to otherwise dark and gloomy cinematic terrain.

While I do admit that The Great Escpae is still a better movie than this one (The Great Escape is probably one of my favorite all time movies) this movie is a great and classic one as well.Just like The Great Escape, the movie knows to create a perfect balance between its drama and comedy. This movie could easily been turned into a heavy war drama but instead a more light approach gets picked, without loosing any of its serious and more dramatic power. It makes the movie entertaining as well as effectively powerful. It can be assumed that The Great Escape and its style got inspired by this movie.The movie is a 'great' portrayal of the lives of American officer POW's, in a German stalag. They try to make the best of it, with very limited resources. Every small thing and things that are out of the ordinary are the things that make them go through their days and is what's keeping them alive. The first halve of the movie isn't even about the William Holden character and he is just one of the boys. It isn't after about halve way through the movie that the story takes to take shape and the main plot of the movie becomes obvious. In advance you would just expect from this movie to be one about POW's trying to escape. But the story is way better written and layered than that though.But it above all things is also a very well made and especially directed one, by 6 time Academy Award winner Billy Wilder. He also received a directing nomination for this movie. It's a '50's movie but it doesn't feel like one. The movie seems to be ahead of its time with its story handling, directing and just overall style of film-making. The camera-work is especially great and worth mentioning.William Holden does a great job at portraying a complicated character. At first you just don't know what to think of him and he isn't a very likable character but he slowly turns into a strong and more important character, that starts doing the right thing. Holden also actually won an Oscar for his role in this movie, despite the fact that he never really wanted to do this movie. It was the only Oscar he ever got, which makes it quite ironic.A great powerful, entertaining classic, which was truly ahead of its time.10/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"A wonderful war film that dares to be different","Date":"15 November 2006","Score":"21 out of 26 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, War","Review":" This is one of Billy Wilder's best films and still stands up very well today. Unlike the concentration camps of the Holocaust, prison camps for Allied prisoners were actually not all that bad in comparison (except for how the Russian prisoners were treated--they were often just shot). So, the prisoners enjoyed a little more freedom and were constantly trying to deal with the incredible boredom of being locked up with very little to do. As a result, films about these camps (such as this one and THE GREAT ESCAPE) are few and far between--they would just be too dull to merit a movie. However, in the case of this film, the monotony is disrupted because there apparently is a snitch within the prisoners' ranks--some rat is tipping off the Commandant (director Otto Preminger--in one of his few acting roles) about escape attempts, major rule infractions and who the actual perpetrator of a major act of sabotage was.Naturally, prisoners begin to think that William Holden is the snitch. After all, he is living incredibly well compared to all the other Allied prisoners in the camp due to all his money-making schemes and black market activities. In addition, he is so cynical and apparently unpatriotic that he has no desire to escape--he's more than willing to sit tight until the war is over since he is safe and happy! In this role, Holden's character is VERY similar to the one he played in BRIDGE OVER THE RIVER KWAI--where he is also a schemer and mostly focused on saving his own sorry butt! However, the problem of the snitch isn't so simply solved and much of the film is about how Holden proves he was NOT the spy for the Germans.The movie is odd in that it is a combination of both drama and comedy--with alternating moods throughout the film. Some of the ways the bored prisoners create their own fun are incredibly funny (especially the MEIN KAMPF scene) and some of the moments are poignant and exciting (such as the escape at the end of the film). All this comes together wonderfully in the marvelous ending of the film. The movie features exceptional acting, writing and direction and is one of the best WWII films ever made. See it--it's well worth your time. "},{"Title":"Nobody has ever escaped from Stalag 17. Not alive, anyway.","Date":"17 February 2008","Score":"18 out of 22 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, War","Review":" Director Billy Wilder was certainly no stranger to the horrors of World War Two. He was born in Austria-Hungary now Poland in 1906, but moved to Berlin to begin a career in movies. However, following the rise of Adolf Hitler, Wilder &#150; being Jewish &#150; fled for Paris and then the United States. His mother, grandmother and stepfather died at the Auschwitz concentration camp. As such, I think it'd be safe to presume that Wilder housed a considerable hatred towards Nazis, which makes his POW-picture, 'Stalag 17 (1953),' all the more remarkable. Whereas the film might have developed into a bleak, depressing drama, the screenplay by Wilder and Edwin Blum adapted from a play by Donald Bevan and Edmund Trzcinski effortlessly blends drama and comedy, clearing the path for other similarly-themed war-time films David Lean's 'The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957)' and John Sturges' 'The Great Escape (1963)' and even TV series 'Hogan's Heroes (1965-1971)' clearly used Wilder's film as a template &#150; including an identical Sgt. Schulz &#150; despite a failed court case in which producers sued for infringement.The year is 1944, in the week before Christmas. Stalag 17, a Nazi prisoner-of-war camp, is situated somewhere along the Danube River, and hundreds of captured Allied sergeants have been imprisoned there. The Americans of Barrack 4 endure a dull, deprived lifestyle, with each day consisting of unwholesome meals, tedious labour and uncomfortable living conditions. Displaying that typical American cleverness and resourcefulness, many of the prisoners have banded together to ensure themselves a few added luxuries &#150; such a makeshift radio to listen to the latest war news &#150; and to build an effective escape tunnel beneath the camp. However, it soon becomes apparent that there is a Nazi spy within their midst. After two escaping prisoners are immediately shot down, and their escape passage is inexplicably discovered, the men turn their suspicions towards J.J. Sefton (William Holden), a selfish and arrogant prisoner with a dog-eat-dog mentality that sees him openly bribing the German guards for luxuries. An unsympathetic character, one who nonetheless exhibits a certain streak of integrity, Sefton decides to uncover the true traitor of Barrack 4.Though he was reluctant to play such an unlikable character, Holden won the Best Actor Oscar for his powerful performance via the second-shortest acceptance speech in Academy Awards history &#150; a simple thank you. The other actors in the film also create distinct and likable personalities, and I particularly enjoyed the big, oafish Animal (Robert Strauss) and Shapiro (Harvey Lembeck). Goodness knows what compelled the writers to make Sgt. Schulz (Sig Ruman), a loathsome tyrant in any other film, a jolly and hearty buffoon, but it works absolutely perfectly, his character's incompetence best highlighted in the sequence where he is distracted into playing volleyball, and enjoys the game so much that he hands his loaded weapon to the nearest POW. As Sefton attempts to uncover which fellow prisoner is leaving secret messages for their Nazis captors, Wilder intersperses the drama with an episodic flow of comedic situations, placing particularly emphasis on the means by which prisoners will alleviate their desire for the opposite sex. A hilarious sequence sees the drunken Animal mistaking his dressed-up bunk-mate for the cinema beauty Betty Grable, of whom he has an undying obsession.

This is Wilder at the top of his cynical game. Not a frame of film is wasted in this movie and even the most minute performances shine.Of course the big prize here is the Oscar won by William Holden for Best Actor of 1953. In a recent biography of Wilder, I learned that Kirk Douglas was Wilder's original choice to play Sefton. Douglas wanted to do it and I'm sure would have been very good in the part, but he had prior commitments. So Wilder turned to Holden with whom he had done Sunset Boulevard and the results were sensational.While making the film, Holden grew to hate his character. He urged Wilder to do something to soften Sefton and Wilder refused. I think the results vindicate Wilder and Holden was the first to agree.Stalag 17 was a play set in only the barracks for the stage. To adapt it for the screen, Wilder created one character that was not in the original play, that of Cookie. Gil Stratton's performance blends so nicely in with the cast that that fact came as something of a surprise to me. Cookie is the offscreen narrator and it is through his eyes in which we see the action unfold.Wilder has such a marvelous sense of the absurd here. In Stalag 17 he created in my opinion one of the great absurd moments in film history. During the mail call scene Harvey Lembeck is getting a ton of letters and poor Bob Strauss is pining away that no one wrote to him. He questions Lembeck and he finds that all the letters were from a collection agency about his overdue payments on his Plymouth.Instead of love letters to Sugar Lips Shapiro, the collection agency wants the third payment on the Plymouth, the fourth, the fifth, the sixth, they want the Plymouth.I don't know about the rest of you, but the sublime absurdity of a collection agency tracking some soldier all the way to a POW camp in Germany for overdue car payments just cracks me up every time I see Stalag 17.Lembeck and Strauss were a great team together. Strauss was nominated for best Supporting Actor, but lost to Frank Sinatra.Lembeck has another favorite moment of mine in the film. The main plot is to discover who in the barracks is a stoolie. Almost at the end of the film when the stoolie is discovered, the stoolie tries to protest. Lembeck, who's been a comic character throughout the film, drops his voice down and just says he said to shut up. There is such a chill in his voice it will frighten the audience. Again sublime film technique by a master.If Billy Wilder were making the film today some of the homoerotic overtones would be a lot more explicit. These men have not had any female companionship for a while and I'm sure some of the other prisoners would have started looking good. There's the Christmas dance in which poor Bob Strauss with some homemade hooch in him, starts dancing with Harvey Lembeck and thinking she's Betty Grable because Lembeck is in some impromptu drag. Also at the dance the blonde naive pretty kid Peterson played by Robert Shawley who you see being held rather tightly by one of the other prisoners. That was about as far as you could go back in 1953.In fact one of the reasons that Holden is hated so much by the rest of the barracks is that he's worked it out so he could consort with the Russian female prisoners in another part of the camp. The best thing the rest of them have in that barracks is Robert Shawley. He'd be a lot more explicitly gay by necessity or maybe even inclination today.Fellow director Otto Preminger is great as the camp commandant and Billy Wilder favorite Sig Ruman is Sergeant Schultz. But he's not your Hogan's Heroes Sergeant Schultz. In fact as the plot unfolds Ruman is not quite the buffoon as we are originally led to think. It's a very subtle piece of acting by Sig Ruman, probably the best performance in his career.In fact Stalag 17 is a wonderful ensemble gathering of great players performing a timeless story.

That's why I rate this a five.The plot elements that focus on the drama and intrigue of an informer in the midst of allied prisoners in a German WWII prison camp are excellent. If the film had focused only on that, along with the addition of the acting and screen presence of William Holden, this would have been a wonderful film. Unfortunately, it is hindered by an overabundance of stupid shenanigans by a few characters who are supposed to be the standard comic relief. I think the intention was to depict these figures as lovable goofballs who are doing what they can to cope with prison life. That intention fails completely, since they never give any indication that life in the POW camp is anything but a time for frivolity and pranks, as if they are just grade school brats away at summer camp.Evidently, the idea was to have a film that was half-comedy and half-drama, but the comedic portions come off as annoying, time-consuming filler until the film can resume the interesting drama - and real story - involving Holden as the self-centered and unpopular fellow prisoner who is singled out as the traitor in the barracks.Actually, the dry, cynical humor from Holden and some others would have provided just the right balance of comic relief. Unfortunately, the scenes in which the Shapiro and Animal characters all-too often dominate are virtually unbearable. Their inane antics are pathetically unfunny. The presence of the Animal in particular is made even more repulsive by the over-the-top attempt to appear grungy-charming while only coming off as a constant, grotesque and distracting irritant to what you really want to see.It really is a shame. You can also take away the guy with the nasally voice who reads announcements. Toss him out with Shapiro, and the Animal and actually you might have a very enjoyable film.

A must see.","Date":"7 November 2003","Score":"13 out of 18 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, War","Review":" Some viewers criticize Stalag 17 for technical inaccuracies and conflicts between comedy and drama in the story. I strongly disagree. I think the film is perfect.I saw Stalag 17 in 1954 at age seven, with my late uncle. He was shot down over Germany in 1944 and spent 14 months in Stalag Luft I (Barth, Germany). He said the film was an accurate depiction of kriegie life.When I was a teenager he and I discussed the film and both agreed it was excellent. Yes, there was much suffering and death in POW camps. But he said there was humor as well. In fact, it was the only way he maintained his sanity. His POW Log (a hard cover diary type book with blank pages for writing and drawing, donated to POWs by the International Red Cross) contained many tales of POW hi-jinks and other funny stories, so I think that aspect of the movie was on target.American and British POWs viewed escape as both a serious endeavor and a game to outwit the Germans. The Air Force Museum in Dayton, Ohio has a display devoted to Luftwaffe POW camps and displays one German poster from 1944-45 that declared Escape activity is no longer considered a game and POWs attempting to escape will be shot, so it appears that, at least up to the last year of the war, both sides saw escape activity as a test of will and competition. It also reduced boredom, on both sides.Viewing this film, one should remember the Luftwaffe considered allied airmen to be brothers of sorts and gave them better treatment than other POWs received. And they certainly treated military prisoners much better than civilians in concentration camps. On the other hand, the Japanese were extremely brutal to all prisoners. An excellent film about Japanese POW Camps is 1965's adaptation of James Clavelle's book King Rat, with George Segal, who also plays a character like Sefton. Clavelle also co-wrote the screenplay for The Great Escape.Stalag 17 is well paced and the characters fully developed. William Holden is perfect as Sefton. I think he was probably the first film anti-hero; a role he played throughout his acting career (Bridge on the River Kwai; The Bridges at Toko-Ri). Sefton wasn't a collaborator. He just traded sharper than other guys. And of course he ran lucrative floating games of chance and a black market operation.Neville Brand shines as a tough POW who hates Sefton and leads a group who give him a 'blanket party' one night. Shapiro and 'Animal' are classic clowns and foul ups who continuously provide hilarious comedy relief. Otto Preminger is nothing short of superb as the arrogant Prussian who was transferred from the cavalry to be a POW camp warden. His daily diatribes to the sergeants are priceless. Schultz is exactly what we expect, a mindless boob. Clearly, the TV series Hogan's Heroes' Sergeant Schultz was based on him. By the way, my uncle and I both thought Hogan's Heroes was absolute trash and an insult to all POWs.POSSIBLE SPOILER The best surprise in the entire movie is the discovery of the stool pigeon. We never expect Peter Grave's character, Sgt. Price, to be the English speaking German masquerading as an American in order to rat out the POWs' escape plans. It is poetic justice that after Sefton is beaten up because the guys in his hut think he's the stoolie, he is the one who catches Price. 'Pricehoffer' (Graves) is gunned down by his own soldaten, when he is tied up and noisily thrown out into the yard as a decoy the night Sefton and Lt. Dunbar escape.In the end, Sefton does the right thing and clearly redeems himself. He uses an inner courage we didn't think he had to help LT Dunbar escape before he's turned over to the Gestapo as a saboteur. But then Sefton does do it for a reward from Dunbar's rich family, so he's still playing the angles up to the end.This is one of the best films about WW II. Holden clearly deserved his best actor Oscar.

While the prisoners talk every little detail of the escape plan and send their friends Manfredi and Johnson to a tunnel they dug under a barbed wire one of the prisoners stands out and opens a bet that Manfredi and Jonson never make it through the forest surrounding camp. When Manfredi and Johnson are shot right way after they emerge from the other end of the tunnel the prisoners jump to conclusions that Sefton,who bets on the escape, is a stoolie. They actually have the wrong guy but Sefton is not someone liked around either. He is a cynical,cold guy who trades blatantly with the German soldiers for eggs, silk stockings, blankets and other luxuriousnesses for a POW in a camp. He also organizes rat races and and manages a portable distillery in the barracks.So just because he is not a straight-arrow it won't be easy for him to disprove the rash conclusions of the sergeants. The plot may sound a bit common maybe as I put it but the movie actually is not.Generally I do not like a genre being tilted towards another genre.If you are doing a war movie then take your job seriously but I feel like for the first time I did not frown upon the amount of humor in the movie.I read some viewers have been disappointed at the amount of dark-humour in what should be a true war drama. But in an environment where they have no heating facilities (like even a simple stove),eat terrible foot,bathe in the latrine sinks,walk through the muddy walkways they try to keep sane thanks to that humor.By this way they really defy the cynical,cold,mocking air of von Scherbach (Otto Preminger) and their stupid supervisor Sergeant Schulz (Sig Ruman.)I do not like to tell anything controversial about IMDb's top 250 list again but I can't help it.There are many(and probably will be many more) movies that I'm disappointed by in this list but this one (as specifically not a usual,simple faded prison flick story) perfectly met my expectations.

It is uproariously funny, it is immensely suspenseful & it has characters you will root for (though not necessarily William Holden - the designated hero!). At times the camarederie between the concentration camp inmates is like boys in a college hostel. One of them is the teacher's pet & feeds him with confidential information. Some lust after the girls in the hostel across the road. Another one runs illegal gambling & bootlegging operations.

Class conflict in a strictly disciplined body is also tackled, as is the gay subtext in a prison camp. The last theme has been an issue in many POW movies - Great Escape, Bridge on the River Kwai, Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence. In the interplay of the Shapiro & Animal characters in 'S17' with the latter's Betty Grable obsession, we see enough evidences of this. The film's most magical moment to me is when the inmates of Stalag 17 sing & dance to the old confed. song &#145;Johnny Comes Marching Home Again'.

He didn't want to do the movie, and was forced to, under contract to the studio. I see that Charlton Heston and Kirk Douglas both turned it down. Apparently, they all detested what the character represented. But a juicy role like this is precisely what a real actor dreams of; it is a chance to prove your chops. Jack Nicholson understood this, and was always looking for out of character roles to extend his range. It is only when an actor delivers a performance out of character that you really know they can act. It convinced his peers, who gave him the Academy Award for best actor. There is a lot of humor, surely more than in real life, but it seems to get the right balance, and to have set a precedent. Catch-22, Slaughterhouse Five, M*A*S*H and, of course, Hogan's Heroes (which was obviously based on Stalag 17) all use humor to make the awful blackness of war bearable. But I think if this were remade today, more realism in the secondary characters would be expected.spoiler alertI like the arc of the story, the cynical POW who has no plans to escape ironically changing his mind and becoming something of a hero. It produces a very satisfying conclusion. But then, it is in character, as there is profit if he succeeds. And given all his scheming and bartering, Holden is more likely to succeed than the others.Robert Graves takes on the role of the real bad guy, and from his performance, we wouldn't guess who he was, but then he was a lot younger. If you don't already know Sig Ruman, you haven't seen enough old films. To Be Or Not To Be is another of his great roles. Otto Preminger is another German expat in the movie, and one we saw very rarely as an actor. The movie begs the question of the viewer, what would you have done in a German POW camp? I have a fair amount of sympathy with the Holden character. Escape seemed improbable, and pointless so near the end of the war. Life was bad, but not nearly as bad as in a Japanese POW camp, where your chances of survival were not good. The movie avoids stereotyping the Preminger and Ruman characters as evil Germans, though they were not nice people, either. What we see are a lot of different, colorful characters, each with their own strategy for coping with the situation, each honorable from their own perspective, even, I suppose, Grave's German-American spy.In the end, Holden's character was honorable and redeemed himself. It's strange, in retrospect, that Heston and Douglas didn't understand this.

The most famous of course is The Great Escape, which is well deserving of its recognition. This subject matter makes for a very watchable film, as Stalag 17 is.The plot focuses around a stoolie within one of the bunkhouses. The captives in this house are constantly having their secrets discovered and their plans stymied, with sometimes serious consequences. Obviously there must be a traitor among them, but who is it? This problem creates a certain tension throughout most of the film and keeps the film quite viewable throughout. This movie does an excellent job of progressively revealing more and more about the true nature of what is happening (to the point where you know exactly what is going on), while at the same time sustaining the tension.The film also provides much comic relief, some of which is genuinely funny, and some of which fell flat (in my opinion) and distracted from the actual plot. Particularly distracting was the over the top performance of Robert Strauss as Animal who was just too goofy for my tastes. In several scenes the film almost gains a screwball feeling, which didn't fit the content of this movie.However, in spite of that the film is very well worth watching for its underlying plot and the interaction between many others of the cast.

Since films were plentiful, this movie took Prisoner of War life and brought it to the heartland of America. The film is called  Stalag 17  and is the best representation of said life as envisioned by consummate director Billy Wilder. The story takes place in 1944, during the famous Battle of the Buldge. 600 American soldiers, Sargents all, share the minimal and miserable existence of Prisoners of War. One night, two prisoners try a planned night-time escape, but are quickly captured and murdered. Because they were so easily betrayed, the rest of the men in the barracks suspect a traitor lives among them. But who? Neville Brand, who plays 'Duke' quickly suspects the most cynical of their group, one J.J. Sefton. (William Holden). This is because, Sefton is at ease in the prison and creates suspicion when getting along with the enemy. He also is content to not be seen as a hero. When the two men are killed, his fellow prisoners suspect he will also betray the new arrival, one Lt.James Dunbar (Don Taylor) who is accused of destroying a German ammunition train. Otto Preminger plays Col. Von Scherbach, the German commandant of the camp. Robert Strauss who is Stanislas Kasava and Harvey Lembeck, as Harry Shapiro play the camp clowns and bring much humor into an otherwise dreary existence. Richard Erdman, Peter Graves and Sig Ruman who plays German Sgt. Johann Schulz complete the main cast. Together the entire film is a remarkable tribute to the soldiers who suffered at the hands of the German and thus created a living memory which in turn gave us this war time Classic.

Another thing that really impressed me was how Wilder sustained the suspense of the plot (Who is the traitor?) for so long. Wilder encourages us, nay, implores us through his silently roving camera and objectivity, to question everyone. And we do, from Sefton to Animal to Joey.This should be regarded as one of Wilder's best films. It's exceptional film-making. Wilder's films remain so fresh today because of his near-perfect scripts that have possess honesty instead of sentimentality, and his willingness to let his characters and story impress instead of burdening the film with showy technique.

The rest of the inmates suspect that one amongst them is an informer but when the suspicion falls on the camp's notorious black marketeer, he decides to find out the real culprit before it's too late for him.Excellently directed by Billy Wilder, Stalag 17 is another one of his unpolished gems which is set during the final years of World War II, in a Nazi prisoner of war camp and yet, despite its grim setting, remains a fun & rollicking experience from start to finish. Cleverly scripted as well, Wilder effortlessly succeeds in balancing all its elements, provides just the perfect dose of every genre this film deals with & employs near-perfect use of humour in its plot.Coming to the technical aspects, the camps depicted in the movie have an authentic feel to some extent, the black n white photography is brilliantly carried out, editing keeps the flow of entertainment smooth & although the use of music is minimal, it's fitting wherever it is present. Every character we interact with exhibit a distinct personality yet it's William Holden who plays an anti-hero here whom we choose to invest our emotions in & are finely rewarded in the end, thanks to his stellar performance.On an overall scale, Stalag 17 is one of the finest World War II prisoner of war films that has something in store for every kind of cinema viewer out there. It's a first rate spy-thriller that offers a first-rate entertainment with its brilliant take on the genres of war, drama, comedy, thriller & mystery and doesn't feel even slightly aged despite being over half century old. People who don't like something funny being made out of what was a horror event may find a lot to criticize but for me, it just works. Highly recommended.

Whenever I feel low, or feel like bored, I get hold of a Wilder film and his films have each time surprised me, from Major Or Minor to One,Two,Three there is a charisma that I believe, only Wilder could bring to the film. Stalag 17 is about a prison escapade and it's not a serious drama nor a suspenseful thriller, it's a plain fun-watch. It has many moments of wit and humor, especially for the good first part. Be it Animal (Robert Strauss) flirting with Russian women, or Shapiro (Harvery Lembeck) collecting letters, they are fun filled scenes and they did not seem to be cynical or mocking at the Nazis. They seemed just plain funny. Wilder, I must say is a master writer, who knows not just only the dialog but also in which tone if it is said, brings out what emotion in an actor, and what reaction can be derived from a viewer. He deliberates acts in this film and they sync well with the script. Not for once, I felt anything was out of place, in this escape drama. Though most of the film focuses on the acts of the prisoners and how they have fun with each other day in and day out, rather than the plan of escape and all, I felt it was all right there, and it helped me engage and even empathize with their characters. Wilder, is one of the few master of the basic principle of writing, that is actions and motives make characters, a set of these characters make a plot and better their actions, better the plot. I am speaking more of the genius of Wilder I think than the film in itself. OK, the film touches all the right notes, in it's 2 hour length and fails to falter as per me. It's not a great Prisoners of War film like Bridge on the River Kwai or even Shawshank Redemption but this essentially a film where a set of people have a motive and they get their thing done. William Holden as Sergeant Sefton gives a delightful performance and there is a host of other actors who gave some wonderful performances too, like Robert Strauss as Animal The sound design seemed perfect, considering that this is a 1953 film and it had to accommodate a landscape of War. The editing was fine too, and other aspects did a great job. Of all, I am impressed with the environment that Wilder brings with each of his films, be it Lost Weekend or Some Like It Hot or even The Apartment. There is a sense of belonging such as being in that place, where the characters are, this is effectively done by right lighting and right art direction and even supreme cinematography. But Wilder has proved yet again that he was one of the most original and most acceptable voices we had who used his pen to speak more effectively than most men do. I salute his dialog, his scene writing and even his screenplay. Though the credit is shared by Edwin Blum, I suppose so that Wilder was behind the writing.I am going with 4/5 for this. It's not the ideal nail biting stuff if such is the expectation, it's laid back fun-filled watch that mostly you will not regret watching. I am happy to have caught up with this.

I only own this one and his best, by a mile, Ace In The Hole. This movie has always been attacked for its levity overcoming its verisimilitude the whole Shapiro / Animal narrative. Yes, it gets on my nerves a bit. It is, admittedly, too long; yet, Holden with exception of Bridge On The River Kwai, gives his very best acting performance. This is his movie, everything else is background. Joyously corrupt, looking out for himself, he has left the war far behind him. And detractors, this is the point of the movie. Even for those of you who loathed the animal / Shapiro stuff, do not miss the main theme of the movie. Sefton's existential flight from the horrors about him. At the very beginning, as we see the bodies of two men shot trying to escape, Von Scherbach joyfully mocks them and their plans to leave his death camp. The narrative center is this path of awakening by Sefton. When we meet him, he is utterly detached from the war, running all kind of money making schemes to buy black market food with for his ever bulging chest under his bed. The best way to understand Wilder's purpose here is to focus upon Sefton and how he is sucked into the war again, against his will, believe me.His powerful money-making mind begins noticing odd things pointing to the spy in the barracks. This is the irony, he saves them all, quite inadvertently. Of course, due to his corruption and indifference, everyone in the barracks assumes Sefton has to be the rat. He brags openly of trading with the Nazis for the men this is but a small step to treason. The movie is the existential change in Sefton which becomes quite personal when he is severely beaten by the men. Even Hoffy, the barracks' leader, comes to believe it has to be Sefton. I love the movie for one of the funniest scenes in all of cinema. It is in my header, the men detest the corpulent, jovial Sgt. Schultz who feigns such consanguinity with the men it will make you vomit. One of the recently captured men puts Hitler mustaches on all the men. Holding the requisite copy of Mein Kampf, he begins lecturing the men, perfecting aping that paper hanging, house painting lunatic. As Schultz comes in the door, stares aghast, the men turn facing him,Are you all good little Nazis? Are you all good little Adolphs? Schultz is so startled at a hundred men wearing Hitler mustaches, the look on his face is priceless. He mumbles, almost inaudibly,One Fuhrer is enough. As the movie progresses, Sefton's, now redirected mind, discovers who the traitor is. The Nazis have hidden a Bundist, from America, who returned home to serve Germany. They have carefully secreted him among the men. I will not spoil it for you. I understand the detractors who just hate the dancing, eternal mail calls, the obsession with the Russian women showering, yet the core is this change in Holden. True, the beating made it personal; still, look what he does at the very end. He volunteers to get Dunbar out of the water tower and escape from the camp. Believe me, the Sefton at the very beginning would have laughed if you asked him to do this. Hoffy stares in disbelief,You're going to take him? Sefton points out the great distraction they have now the traitor. They tie cans to his feet and eject him out of the front of the barracks right under the spotlights. Wilder is trying to make it less jingoistic but, truly, when you watch it again, ask yourself if the Sefton at the very start of the movie would have taken this great of a risk?I enjoy it, despite its flaws, for an alienated, cynical businessman coming to see the costs of the war in the dead bodies of his comrades. He hides from them, and himself, his anger at the Nazis' murderous cruelty. For those of you put off by too stridently patriotic movies, this is for you. Preminger steals the movie as the most sarcastic, arrogant head Nazi,That little man who stole his name from our capital, something or other, Berlin? Wilder's levity covers the seriousness of the narrative but Sefton comes out from his nihilistic cynicism and re-joins the war. A Good Movie. Q.E.D.

Mr. Wilder had all of the necessary skills and balance of the serious, the tragic, the humorous and the ridiculous to pull off the Seri-Comic qualities which are inextricably blended and intermingled in the Play; be it on Stage or Screen.WE notice that there are only 2 carry-overs in roles from the Stage to the Screen. Those two being Harvey Lembeck (Harry Shapiro) and Robert Strauss (called Stosh on Stage, but Stanislaus Kasava or Animal in the film.

The camp's particular barracks has a problem for which that the inmates must find a solution. There is a one among them that no one wants; being a traitor, an informant a Kraut Spy! Aloof, cool and very business like, Sgt. Frank Sefton (William Holden) is Suspect Numero Uno. Sefton, it seems, has no interest in anything else but himself and his sundry money making enterprises. His only confidant is Cookie (Gil Stratton) who runs some of his games (Rat Races, things like that!) and keeps his Books.The inmates deal daily with one German Sgt. Schultz (Sig Ruman) who seems very benevolent, but underneath this fa√ßade, he is a loyal German Soldier and true Nazi. On occasion, the prisoners have the experience of being addressed directly by the Camp Commandant, Colonel von Scheurbach (Otto Preminger, making a rare on camera appearance). The Colonel is a bitter former Cavalry Officer, who now, being relegated to this definitely below-his-dignity job. This is, by the way, a truly outstanding characterization by Mr. Preminger, quite possibly being done as a favor to Mr. Wilder.All's well in the end as the real informant is discovered and dealt with as Sefton splits the scene, taking the Socially Prominent and Wealthy (in Civilian Life), Lieutenant Dunbar, out with him. THE END. (We tried not to give away too much, right Schultz?) STALAG 17 has a tremendous cast, and other than the appearance of some Russian Women prisoners, it's an all male cast. And what an outstanding line-up it is! Other than the previously mentioned William Holden, Harvey Lembeck, Robert Strauss, Otto Preminger and Sig Ruman; we have an Army of others. With all shining in their parts, we must salute Richard Erdman, Peter Graves, Neville Brand (one of the top decorated Soldiers in the real War!), Michael Moore (not the same guy, obviously), Peter Baldwin, Robinson Stone, Robert Shawley, William Pierson, Jay Lawrence, Erwin Kaiser, Edmund Trzcinski, et al! Peter Graves once said in an interview that being in this picture should have been a real boost for his career. But going to the movies was in decline in the 1950's; so Mr. Graves joined his real life bro, James Arness (GUNSMOKE) in Television, as Mr. Jim on FURY.STALAG 17, of course, was the inspiration for its own take-off, HOGAN'S HEROES (Bing Crosby Productions/CBS TV, 1965-71); but that's another story!

On one simple level, it's enjoyable as a tightly made film, period. The acting, writing, editing, and photography--coordinated of course by now legendary director Billy Wilder--snaps like a whip, and two hours goes by fast. A host of minor actors pull of major performances, and the one really big name, William Holden, has the most unusual role, and he gives it an unfriendly edge that really helps save the movie. Save the movie, that is, from a kind of frivolousness. It is, at its core, a really well made sitcom. The situation is a Nazi prison camp, not the kind of place we expect humor. And the comedy comes from making fun of the Nazis, who are always fair game. The reference to Hogan's Heroes is no joke, for those who have seen that 1960s series around the same situation (even including a comic Sgt. Schultz). The producers of Stalag 17 sued the producers of Hogan's Heroes and won. But Stalag is not just a comic romp. There are shades of bitterness that reflect a real camp--almost the kind of gallows humor you need to survive a horrible situation. And there is also a serious strand about who you can trust, about finding the traitor on the inside, and about persecuting the wrong man. Strictly a studio production, this falls just three years after Wilder's Sunset Blvdwhich uses Holden in another embittered role, and which makes fun of studio productions and Hollywood in general. Though based on a Broadway play, it rises above any sense of being set on a stage, and yet it really does not achieve any sense of realism. It's just short of a farce. The narration at the start announces that here, at last, we will have a movie not about the front and fighting, but about prisoners in a prison camp. It announces, that is, that it will be a different kind of WWII film.And it is. Holden won best actor for his role. Otto Preminger, the great German director working in Hollywood (and bucking the censors there), plays the commandant of the prison. And Peter Graves is another prominent prisoner, a counterpart to Holden. The photography is by none other than the great Ernest Laszlo, and Franz Waxman heads up the music. It's no wonder it's a smart, sharp, snappy film. What it isn't, however, is deep or probing or moving. It's an entertainment, and a great one, but it keeps any larger expectations in check.

When I watched the movie again after a year or so, I felt almost disappointed since I noticed how the humor wears out midway through and gritty realism gets the upper hand. The plot about finding the right stoolie and escaping the harsh conditions of the camp had me strongly rooting for the POWs, but after the film I felt a little depressed.I just saw Stalag 17 a third time, and only now did I realize how well balanced the drama and humor were. We get the comedy relief first, and when it's time to concentrate on the actual storyline, the humor is shoved away (except for one last funny bit with Animal and Shapiro) and it's time to really start rooting for the prisoners.I've seen nearly all movies Wilder directed, and, along with such later films as Some Like It Hot, One Two Three and Irma La Douce, Stalag 17 ranks among my favorites (I still need another viewing of Sunset Boulevard).

But the idea that the Germans would put a spy inside an American POW camp (comprised of sergeants) is ludicrous. After watching the film in 2006, I learned that Wilder, who was the Director, Producer and one of the writers, broke off his relationship with Paramount when the film was shown in Germany, and the American spy became a Polish spy. Wilder, who had some relatives die in German concentration camps may have been justified for personal reasons, but I think the character Security was a way for Wilder to portray his anti-German feelings. (This movie was made less than a decade after WWII ended).When an artist crosses the line between telling the truth, and starts to engage in propaganda he becomes a hack. There were many goofs made in this movie that illustrated to me that the truth was stretched to cartoon-like proportions. With Nazi manpower stretched to the limit, that the Nazi's would place a spy in a barracks full of sergeants does not make the main plot line believable. It would have been an odious job, and require a professional whose service would have been more valuable at another pursuit. Perhaps the Germans had used a Polish Prisoner to keep track of other prisoners, and wanted to give the film the plausibility it lacked in the original version.The film begins a few weeks before Christmas in 1944. Hundress of American Bombers had crashed inside Germany. Not only did they know everything about their aircraft, the Nazi's had put together pieces of our planes, and had flown them inside US bomber formations as a battle tactic.When Lt. Dunbar is assigned temporarily to the barracks, I wondered why the character couldn't have just been another sergeant. But then William Holden's character couldn't have given the audience the impression that Dunbar's mother's money got him through pilot training. I am not a writer, but I was a USAF pilot, and I know that money and influence doesn't help a bit when your flying solo. Also, did anyone notice that Lt. Dunbar had to look at his dog tags when asked what his serial number was? I can still remember my original numbers, and that was 41 years ago. The scene where Dunbar is sleep deprived (a Geneva convention violation) and in walks the Geneva Accord Representative. To quote one line from the movie, the Krauts may be dumb, but they're not stupid. And everyone seemed to have watches. Are we to believe that watches would not have been stolen by the guards, exchanged for food, blankets and other favors? The writers have Lt. Dunbar being taken away from the camp as a sabateur because he blew up an ammunition train. Is it plausible that a matchbook with a cigarette stuck inside could be thrown inside a train, and three minutes later an fire would consume boxes of ammo with a resulting explosion. How far can one throw book of matches with a cigarette? Do German Ammo cars always travel with their doors open? Did anyone associated with this movie ever handle ammo. It's very hard to ignite, except in the way its intended to be used., i.e, a firing pin, or a very hot fire is necessary for ignition.Since this movie takes place in a mountainous area in Germany, and the time of year is the beginning of winter, Lt. Dunbar would have died of hypothermia, standing in the water tower. Why the Authors choose to put him in the water tower seems more far fetched that the smoke bomb excape from the SS guards. Several commentators have mentioned King Rat in comparison with this movie. Holden won and deserved his Academy Award. But George Siegal was even better in King Rat, and the plot was more believable because Rat was a complete and believable movie. Siegal's character becomes just one more enlisted man whose throne is overturned by the liberation of the camp. In Stalag, as several reviewers have mentioned, is flawed because we don't know whether the excape is successful, and the consequences of the others is unknown. "}{"Title":"Oh boy...

Jakob the Liar was not a great movie but Stalag 17 takes the sins of that film and puts them into overdrive.The humor works in Life is Beautiful because it flows from the situation and has a purpose in the main character's goals during the story. Here it is just forced in between scenes that advance the story. And the characters on both sides are mostly idiots.When this film was among the Top 250 of all time based on IMDb ratings, my expectations were high.

Their scenes in the mud and drooling over the egg like Marty Feldman reminded me of Young Frankenstein, only Mel Brooks would never have jammed two such glaringly unsuited styles together in such a ham-fisted manner.I was ready to turn off the film again when the prisoner with the grover-like voice came in to parrot orders and attention a short while later.While the suspense mounted and the film improved, moments like those and the amiable relationship between the prisoners of the featured barrack and their German babysitter for lack of a more adequate term (though I doubt one exists) stuck in my mind and prevented me from enjoying what seemed like a very well crafted story. I can see how it survived as a play, some of the dialogue is sparing and to the point. I doubt very much that theatre audiences would have tolerated the two near-imbeciles that Hollywood seemed to think were the missing ingredient for transition to film. But then again, I found the same character on everyone loves Raymond to be insulting to me as a viewer because I'm no longer 6 years old, but many didn't seem to mind it. Perhaps I am stuck longing for a perfect movie and this had a few ingredients to take it to that level, and many stumbling blocks to ensure it never reached that point.Billy has done solid drama and comedy, but I would rank this a failure, despite what were likely good intentions on his part.Fans of Billy should check out Some like it Hot, fans of Holden should check out just about everything he's ever done, apart from this, through no fault of his own. Perhaps if he wasn't so good, I could have more readily accepted this film as more junk on the scrap pile.

Maybe if you had never heard of or seen Renoir's Grand Illusion, then it might seem worthwhile, but, in comparison, this film is a pile of manure. I did not laugh once, nor did I ever even crack a smile. The characters are of sitcom depth. In fact, the sitcom about a similar situation, Hogan's Heroes, has more depth (and more comedy) than this film. I wanted to murder the actor who played Animal throughout the whole movie. His mugging for the camera was painful to watch, as was his voice. The dialogue feels like it was written by a mechanic, it is so repetitive. And there is hardly an ounce of humanity to any character in this whole film...with one exception William Holden. He delivers an excellent performance as a man wrongly accused of being a snitch. In fact, I despised every other character in the film, thinking that the Germans, even the German spy, had more integrity than they did. Alas, Holden has no chance to save this film. Those people who had falsely accuse him simply jump onto his bandwagon near the end of the film and they are supposed to be forgiven by the viewer?

Soon the Germans find out about it and they capture Lieutenant Dunbar. All the pressure is on Sergeant Sefton who has to reveal that he is not the informant, by finding out the real one.

I have always said that if Great Britain were defeated in war, I hoped we should find a Hitler to lead us back to our rightful position among the nations. - Winston Churchill Heavily influenced by Jean Renoir's La Grande Illusion (1937), Billy Wilder's Stalag 17 takes place within a German prisoner of war camp during World War 2's final years. The film was released in 1953 and is regarded as one of Wilder's early masterpieces.Stalag's first half develops a subplot in which J.J Sefton, an American black marketeer, is suspected by his comrades of having spied for their German captors. This subplot has been read as a comment on McCarthyism, but if that were so, its resolution, in which Sefton and his buddies band together to weed out the real rat, misses the historical lesson of McCarthyism entirely.Stalag 17 is aided greatly by Ernest Laszlo's grim black-and-white cinematography. Wilder's direction is also expert, though the film too often prettifies life in the camps. This is a feel good POW movie, very Hollywood, and anticipates Wilder's later, lighter, Lubitsch styled comedies (as well as the transvestite humour of Some Like It Hot). On the flip side, Wilder teases out a number of very bittersweet and even grim moments, and his Sefton character, infectiously played by William Holden, is always interesting. Pragmatism incarnate, Sefton is a profiteer, a merchant, always taking bets and treating the survival of his comrades as a game of profit, loss, risk and reward. Like Rick in Casablanca, Sefton then calls himself into action, the film ending with him risking his guts for another human being. Is this an act of altruism, though, or another scheme by Sefton undertaken solely because he likes the odds? Bizarrely, Wilder portrays Sefton's profiteering as being detrimental within both the collective confines of the barracks, and the larger landscape of war. When Sefton is labelled a traitor by his fellow Americans, his bounty and profits are then appropriated by the group and distributed amongst the men. Ironically, Allied involvement in WW2 was designed to stop precisely this kind of collectivism. As the Governor of the Bank of England himself quipped, British loans to Hitler should be seen as an investment against Bolshevism and communism. Far from an enemy, the monarchs and aristocrats across Europe, of whom Winston Churchill himself belonged (most of the royalty in Germany, England and Russia were related), championed the German Army. Fearful of revolutions, civil wars, and losing their power, they saw Hitler (and even Mussolini, who Churchill routinely praised) as a weapon to be used against Marxists, Jews, Bolsheviks and Russia itself. A further irony is that, without Stalin's bloody brand of collectivization, Hitler perhaps wouldn't have been defeated; statistically, 79-89% of all Nazi casualties were inflicted by the Soviets.Stalag 17 would prove hugely influential, shaping everything form The Bridge On The River Kwai to The Great Escape to Papillon to King Rat. It would influence the farcical TV show Hogan's Heroes, and would be one of Wilder's last dramas (Witness for the Prosecution and The Spirit of St Louis would follow some years later), the director gradually moving toward comedies.8/10 &#x96; Worth two viewings.

It was adapted from a Broadway play.Produced and directed by Billy Wilder, it features William Holden, Don Taylor, Robert Strauss, Neville Brand, Harvey Lembeck, and Peter Graves. Wilder also cast Otto Preminger in the role of the camp's Commandant.It was adapted by Wilder and Edwin Blum from the Broadway play by Donald Bevan and Edmund Trzcinski who were both prisoners in Stalag 17B in Austria.Stalag 17, exclusively populated by American sergeants, is overseen by sadistic commandant Oberst Von Schernbach and the deceptively avuncular sergeant Schultz. The inmates spend their waking hours circumventing the boredom of prison life; at night, they attempt to arrange escapes. When two of the escapees, Johnson and Manfredi, are shot down like dogs by the Nazi guards, Stalag 17's resident wiseguy Sefton callously collects the bets he'd placed concerning the fugitives' success. No doubt about it there's a security leak in the barracks, and everybody suspects the enterprising Sefton, who manages to obtain all the creature comforts he wants of being a Nazi infiltrator. Things get particularly dicey when Lt. Dunbar, temporarily billeted in Stalag 17 before being transferred to an officer's camp, tells his new bunkmates that he was responsible for the destruction of a German ammunition train. Sure enough, this information is leaked to the Commandant, and Dunbar is subjected to a brutal interrogation. Certain by now that Sefton is the mole, the other inmates beat him to a pulp. But Sefton soon learns who the real spy is, and reveals that information on the night of Dunbar's planned escape.The movie survives the jump from stage to screen with flying colors, thanks to Billy Wilder's typically sterling direction and a darkly funny script.The good greatly outweighs the bad, particularly in the profile of Holden's character, a pragmatic, self-centered cynic whose heroism, when it is finally called upon, appears to come from deep within the barriers he has placed inside of himself.Despite the seriousness of the situation,it is as much comedy as wartime melodrama, with most of the laughs provided by Robert Straussand Harvey Lembeck. Other standouts in the all-male cast include Richard Erdman, Neville Brand, Peter Graves, Gil Stratton and Robinson Stone.It is a bleak, black comedy in which the laughter can die in the throat.

The problem (From the POW point of view) is a lack of discipline. The way that Animial and Blondie conducted themselves would not be tolerated according to any kind of military code you can possibly think of. This goes back to Duke (Neville Brand) who as barracks head, is responsible. The exception to this is of course, Sefton (William Holden), who although out for himself, is always neat, and organized. This kind of lose atmosphere makes it easy for the Germans (Or any other enemy) to slip a mole into the camp. Spoilers The reason I like Sefton is he is smart. He knows that he does not really have a chance of escape, and will wait out the rest of the war (If necessary). In particular he is smart not befriending anyone except Cookie (Gil Stratton), who the film is shown through the eyes of. There is an old NAVY adage, Loose Lips Sink Ships and there are always informants (If not outright moles) in almost every kind of prison environment, so Sefton's strategy is correct. It basically is survival for Sefton, until he is suspected of being a traitor by the camp(Two POWs were killed by the Germans), and he is given a Blanket Party by his fellow POW's and beaten up bad. He realizes his strategy of deal making and having fun with Russian Women will end, and he has to uncover the traitor or he will get killed. His opportunity comes, when Lt. James Dunbar (Don Taylor) is snatched out of the Commandant Von Scherbach's (Otto Preminger) office, and Von Scherbach needs to contact the mole in order to find out where he is. What happens is a phony air raid warning is given and the men are ordered out of the barracks, and Sgt. Schultz (Sig Ruman) meets with the mole who turns out to be Sgt. Price (Peter Graves), who runs security. They set up a system where Price signals Schultz by tying the cord on the light, and the air raid warning comes, and he sends notes to Von Scherbach via a chess piece. This time however, who is hiding in the shadows but Sefton who now knows the truth. But the key is proving it. What happens is the POW's have to hide Dunbar (It turned out to be in the water tower), and Price was going to be involved, but Sefton demanded to be guarded my security, so if something bad happens, they don't have a patsy. Thus Price has no idea where Dunbar is. At the end of the film, the plan is to smuggle Dunbar out of the camp, and Price volunteers to do it. Everyone agreed except Sefton says that Duke already turned over Dunbar to the Germans, and Duke says how he had to keep everyone off of Sefton, but keep his mouth shut. Sefton then starts to interrogate Price and asks him when did the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor, Price says December 7th. Sefton asks What were you doing? Price said Eating Dinner. Sefton Eating Dinner in Berlin. Price said That means nothing, you are not listing to him are you? Duke says I want to hear what he has to say. Sefton then searches Price, and finds the chess piece, and has the proof he needs. Sefton then comes up with a plan about how to get Dunbar out of the tower, and the camp, which is to use Price as a decoy, throw him out in the yard, while Sefton takes Dunbar out. Duke is reluctant but Sefton points out It is Price or Dunbar, its up to you?, and Animal says if we kill him they can retaliate and if he is freed, he can be placed in another POW Camp, but if the Germans do it, nothing can happen to us. They agree to do it, and Price gets shot, and Von Scherbach has an evil smirk on his face, until he sees who got killed, as this occurs, Sefton and Dunbar get away. Much is made of the smile on Sefton's face when he said goodbye to the Camp, showing he is not the total hard ass as he seemed to be, but keep in mind, that he brought Dunbar with him, so he was a hero. What is unsaid but you know will happen is Von Scherbach and Schultz will pay for what happened to Price (The Reich did not tolerate failure) and will end up at the Russian Front or before a Court Martial. Note Both were extremely deserving of this, in particular, Von Scherbach with his abuse of prisoners (In Nazi Germany itself, Field Marshal Hermann Goering would not approve of those actions (The Luftwaffe ran the POW Camps and he respected POW's, unlike the Gestapo, and what they did to Jews and other enemies of the state). Finally, I cannot believe anyone who has seen this film can give it less then 10/10 stars. It is an absolute classic.

I thought the film enthralling with one exception.William Holden is excellent as the cynical prisoner who trades with the Germans to get the good things in life (including women!); he would have revelled in being a black marketeer in post-war Berlin. Holden is a master at moralising from a dubious position and the film's dichotomy of Holden representing self-interest versus the rest representing duty provides Holden with ample scope to display this talent. I have heard that Charlton Heston and Kirk Douglas were considered for his role but neither of them would have been able portray the necessary cynicism (as apposed to unpleasant) with Holden's skill because Heston is too noble and Douglas does not have the talent.The remainder of the cast gave sterling performances; especially the hut chief as the man of reason and the hot-headed Sgt playing the unthinking vigilante, and the ..........German spy! I only have two criticisms 1. The 'animal' character was too stupid to be funny; he was merely irritating. I felt the film would have been darker and more intense if this character and the 'comedy' had been omitted. The 'animal' is the reason I did not score the film a 10.2. Generally, the Germans treated western-allied POWs pretty fairly and I do not think they would automatically have opened fire at anyone within the compound or at escapees when caught. (The murder of 70-odd RAF prisoners was an exception and was carried out by the Gestapo).I would thoroughly recommend this film to fans of POW camp films or fans of Who-Done-Its. You are in for a treat.

The similarities are astounding - from a tubby guard named Schultz to the no escape record of the Kommandant to the fraternizing and trading between prisoners and Germans. It was humorously incredible! But the movie was as well, standing on its own. The opening scene with the overview of the huge prison camp really let us know what we were in for. I loved that they made a movie out of this concept. War and other dark subjects are frequently expounded and explained on film; the plight, struggles, hope, and humor of prisoners of war should get their share of attention from a civilian world that so often is ignorant of these military realities. A little introduction to this world can easily lead to more research, greater appreciation, and perhaps even a lifelong study (as what happened with me for my WWII appreciation, courtesy Hogan's Heroes).But on with the movie - I was really surprised by the rich combination of drama and humor, laughter and poignancy, and of the brief character studies of many of the occupants of Barracks 4. Robert Strauss (as Animal) and Harvey Lembeck (as Shapiro) really stole the show; their characters and acting really shine. The plot picks up about halfway through the film and doesn't let up from there. There are many memorable scenes (getting to the Russian women), laugh-out-loud moments (the reading of Mein Kamph), and heart-clutching moments (the lieutenant's interrogation).The Collector Edition's accompanying mini-documentary on the real POWs of Stalag 17 puts the film in perspective and really made me appreciate what they went through.Overall, a fantastic movie - rich and richly acted.

The comedy is not particularly high-brow or intellectual, mostly it's based on Sergeant Animal and his straight man doing their vaudeville routines, but it works. It's still pretty funny even in 2010.The actual plot of the movie, the imprisoned Americans trying to ferret out a spy in their ranks, isn't delivered with nearly the gusto or energy we'd see in later POW movies, especially The Great Escape. Still, this must have been quite the ground-breaking movie in 1953, and I'm glad it was made. It's still fun to watch, even if I wouldn't rate it as an all-time classic, even of the war movie genre.

Robert Strauss, who plays Animal, is the real heart of this film. Sure, William Holden is great, but Strauss is the comic relief and a lovable guy. Without his antics, the film wouldn't have been the success that it was and is.The antics are great. There's gambling with cigarettes, using mice as horses to simulate horse races, including one named Seabiscuit who loses to Snickelfritz. There's the repeated attempts to get to the other side of the camp in order to see the Russian women.The gist of the film reminded me of the television show Hogan's Heroes, and apparently I'm not alone. Allegedly the creators of Heroes got sued and had to pay a large out-of-court settlement for ripping off the general premise.And that's all I want to say about that.

Wilder flaunts the atmosphere of a screwball comedy, and fires off a lot of gags you would probably only find in one. Simultaneously, he builds very stern suspense with inherent tension and subtle mechanisms set by a few characters.The film's plot screens a lot of very tense things that get us all worked up. It's about a character that deals with false accusations by an entire POW camp full of men that while they're in prison at least have each other. This character does not. He's excluded, beaten, and can only think about that one character who is smugly getting away with all that he's being accused of. And then again, in the undercurrent, there's this interesting crop of quirky characters that populate the stalag. There's a big, scruffy lug named Animal who looks like an American Danny Trejo and could break a few chains apart at once, but he's got an insufferable crush on Betty Grable, and when the news is heard that Grable is married, Animal falls apart. He's got a smaller friend with a higher voice who gets caught up in mishaps with him, like a mixture of Abbott and Costello and George and Lenny from Of Mice and Men. Then there's a guy who shows up at the camp who can do impressions of any actor, and does throughout the film.Stalag 17 is a great American counterpart to Grand Illusion, perhaps. The only difference is that Stalag 17 all but ignores the war and closes in completely on the characters themselves, using the period in time as an incidental part of the plot. It's pure entertainment, and beautifully done by a master of such.

But the slapstick shenanigans of the two morons dulls the dramatic edge of the situation and the plot. It is not a film that is easily viewed more than once due to the endless heavy-handed comedic inanity of Animal and his sidekick. It is , all in all , a very good film, due above all to William Holden's stunning portrayal of a selfish, cynical Sefton with a tarnished sense of patriotism and duty that shines brightly when put to the final test.

But don't get me wrong. He's very effective here as the man everyone in the prison camp thinks is the stoolie who is getting favors from the Germans because he's a thief and a snitch.Holden plays the role without any redeeming character traits other than as a man looking out solely for himself. Most of the time he's quick with a cynical one-liner or smirks rather condescendingly at the foibles of his fellow prisoners. And always, he's on his guard because he knows he's got to look out for the real mastermind hiding among them.The suspense comes from wondering when the real villain will be unmasked. And how. And along with this suspense, there's a lot of dark humor and rowdy laughter, particularly when the men are hellbent on enjoying whatever freedoms they have.It's a taut exercise in suspense laced with humor throughout. As the prison warden, OTTO PREMINGER is almost a caricature of a German soldier, but PETER GRAVES is very effective as the security officer who keeps a low profile. The ending is very effective, with an unexpected twist, and the final impression is one of a strong prison drama enacted superbly by its all male cast, thanks to the solid direction of Billy Wilder.

Of course novelist James Clavell who opted to write about a POW whose idea of coping was to become a Black Marketeer a la William Holden's Sefton has to shoulder some of the blame. King Rat wasn't a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination but teenagers and even twenty-somethings who saw it in 1965 may not have realized that Stalag 17 got there first in 1953. Wilder's touch is present in every frame and one of his tricks - he used it again notably in The Apartment - was to lull the audience into thinking 'comedy' and then subtly injecting drama into the proceedings, in this case drama that involves loss of life. Holden, who became a personal friend, was always at his best working with Wilder and his Best Actor Oscar for Sefton was well deserved and here, despite his own initial reservations and a wish to 'soften' the character, he excels as the morally dubious Sefton who can take the loathing of his fellow prisoners in his stride but is averse to being worked over for something he didn't do. Wilder invented the role of Cookie, the nearest thing to a friend/confidente Sefton has and significantly the Segal character in King Rat also befriends another prisoner, Robert Fox.

The POW commandant seemed comical almost, to me. He seemed as though he'd been drawn from archetypes from rejected Saturday Night Live sketches. His menacing, insinuating monotone seemed to suggest a parody of German commandants rather than that of a real person. Admittedly, commandants might come in all shapes and sizes, but nevertheless, the depiction did seem rather generous. I would have expected a nastier depiction of the German camp leaders rather more fitting than the nearly comedic rendering of the camp commandant that was presented. I don't know if this is just a characteristic of seeing the film 50 years after it was released or if this is a fair criticism. Also, the men seemed rather more upbeat than I might have expected. Obviously they had to keep their spirits up in order to survive, but they just didn't seem very unhappy about being in a prison camp.

Nonetheless, there seems to be an issue with this film that can't be easily ignored. It is precisely the same issue that dogged Hogan's Heroes (which, along with Great Escape, this was loosely based) how can you make fun of war, especially the Nazis? Does making fun of them, or the situation, demonstrate total disregard for the nightmare they inflicted upon generations?First off, there are a number of well-respected people (philosopher & Holocaust survivor, Viktor Frankl and even Mel Brooks come to mind) who believe humor, by virtue of its freedom, is a powerful threat against the villainous fools of this world. Not to mention, humor has a therapeutic value that has been utilized through the most horrendous of circumstances (wartime being one of them - again I refer back to Frankl). Hogan's Heroes, it could be argued, was irresponsible because it doesn't really portray the true villainy of the Nazis, and the motivations of the POW escapes are extremely implausable (Hogan would casually leave - often through such ridiculous escape devices as a hollowed out tree stump - to attend a Nazi ball with a hot date & inexplicably, willingly return to the camp! What happened to duty?). Apart from showcasing what is perhaps Holden's finest performance, Stalag 17 IS responsible in its depiction of Nazi terror (at least relative to its own, contained story about a Nazi mole amongst American prisoners.). Watching this as a child, I never thought the POWs had it easy. Their living conditions are cramped, dirty, cold, uncomfortable & deprived (remember that this came out not too long after the war ended, and more than one veteran I've had the opportunity to meet was impressed by the accuracy of the conditions, uniforms, attitudes & lingo. By the way, many of these actors had served themselves, such as the highly decorated Neville Brand). There are no showers, mattresses consist of a pile of straw atop a blanket, and the food is of the watered-down stew and bread variety. I could only hope to have a Harry & The Animal around to help me cope with such a situation!The commandant (Preminger) is somewhat cartoonish, but he's never shown as anything but cruel (he leaves the two bodies of escapees laying on display in the mud for all of the soldiers to look at; he continually punishes the men by depriving them of luxuries such as a stove - their only source for heat - in the wintertime; he lies and manipulates Geneva representatives and has escapees killed on sight). Does this compare to the terrors of the Holocaust? Of course not. Is it a fairly accurate depiction of German World War II POW camps for enlisted American G.I.s? From what I understand, yes. The soldiers are dedicated to escaping (okay, save for Harry & The Animal's foray into the Russian compound), are smart aleck and defiant to the Germans, entertain each other in highly creative ways and create the feeling of a community (albeit an incarcerated one) that comes off as realistic to me given their circumstances. For the type of movie this is, the details contained herein have always been enough to establish the underlying hardship for me without sacrificing the tone of the plot. This is a truly great film that functions well as a comedy, a mystery-thriller, actioner and drama. There are many different individual stories to be told in any war, and while each example can't possibly encapsulate everything, the stories need to be true at least unto themselves if they are to be told well at all. `Stalag 17' is responsible on those terms.

Of course German guards weren't this buffoonish in real life -- but they weren't very funny either!  Sure barracks weren't filled with identifiable ethnic and class types, but that's one way to create comic possibilities.  Movies are deliberate distortions of life, and that's why they're fun and entertaining.  Stalag 17 was considered to be edgy comedy for its time, along the lines of M*A*S*H later on.  The very idea of Americans at odds with each other over supposed traitors in the ranks is at once a challenge to the gung-ho images presented in more jingoistic war films, and an idea that would have resonated with paranoid McCarthy-era Americans.  By offsetting those serious issues with broad comedy, courtesy of Strauss and Lembeck, the drama is heightened rather than obscured.  And sure, Hogan's Heroes was inspired by this movie, but you can't blame the movie for that.  But I wonder why more people don't note Stalag 17's influence on other films, notably The Great Escape, Dr. Strangelove, M*A*S*H, and even Good Morning Vietnam.Now, the ending.  First, the original ending was much more caustic -- Sefton was to deliver the Let's just pretend we never met line and duck out with a scowl.  The studio wouldn't go for it, and made Wilder put in Sefton's little reappearance and grin/salute to the guys.  Boy, would it have been dark the other way!  Also, this movie has a great cynical closing line, like many Wilder movies, this one mouthed by Animal (I think)  Hey, maybe he just wanted to steal our wire cutters.  Ever think of that?

I give it an 8 out of 10; good solid entertainment but not in the legendary, classic status you would think from it's IMDB rank of being the top #153 of all time.I could overlook the obvious jingoism and Germans bad, Americans good since it's a product of its times, McCarthyism, and the Cold War.  But overall, as a war movie, I thought it was an insult to people in real prison camps!  I guess it's hard to take something too seriously which turned into Hogan's Heroes.  Don't get me wrong, there are funny bits and the whodunit story interwoven with the comic stuff is pretty good.  I especially liked the proud capitalist wanna-be-rich-guy meeting up with the proud capitalist already-rich-guy (enemies at first, partners at the end).  Basically this movie is a propaganda piece, although by the time it was made the war was long over, and the only war was cold with the Russians.  So it was a little odd that the Russians were OK in the film but the Germans were still dumb but not stupid (Einstein, Bohr, et al would be glad to know that ;-).But the idea that Russian woman prisoners had nothing to do but giggle for strapping American lads to try and ogle them, or give a piece for some silk stockings was a bit tough.  And the obvious buffoonery of the German soldiers was a bit silly although you can see the segue into the Hogan's Heroes TV show.  I guess the only next step would be the Hoffman's Heroes parody that Mad Magazine did years ago (concentration camp humor).So enjoy it for what it is, but I don't quite see how this is such a classic in the war film canon.  I prefer Duck Soup by the Marx Brothers for comedy and a statement of the inanities of war.

Here we find the peak of Wilder's dislike for any rhetoric, for wholly noble characters, for untarnished heroes. The very opening of the movie is shocking two American soldiers are trying to escape from the German war-prisoner camp Stalag 17. In a barrack of the stalag, everyone is anxious about their destiny. And now comes sergeant Sefton (William Holden) betting that their mates will be caught by Germans! In fact, when they hear a burst of machine-gun, he calmly pockets the stake the cigarettes (current money in the stalag) bet by his fellow-prisoners in the barrack. This first episode gives the tone of the whole movie. The plot is centered on the search of a mysterious spy among the American prisoners. This story is masterly written and masterly solved. The script is magnificent, a perfect blend of drama, suspense and comedy; it oozes ideas of genius. An instance the endless queue of prisoners paying (with cigarettes) to use Holden's kind-of-telescope, to watch for few seconds the hut where the Russian female prisoners are taking showers, dreaming what is happening behind those wooden walls. Extreme care is paid to details. Have you noted that the German soldiers on guard of the stalag are all fat and old? Clear every sound man is at the front. Holden is at his best in the role of the shrewd, cynical anti-hero Sefton. Otto Preminger, in the role of the aged, frustrated commander of the stalag, shows that he is a great actor as well as a great director. All the supporting actors are just superb. Even the funny, comic behavior of some American prisoners is psychologically convincing young guys, even in a tragic condition, are not apt to give way to desperation.

He was in his mid-thirties when it came out, and had been making pictures for close to fifteen years. His first major role, Golden Boy, made him a promising newcomer back in 1939, and for the next decade he toiled as a medium grade star without showing any potential for growth. Then, director Billy Wilder cast him as the gigolo in Sunset Boulevard, and things began to pick up. It was an edgier Holden now, no longer the Smilin' Jim of his youth. Wilder also directed Stalag 17, and this is the one that put Holden over the top, winning him an Academy Award for Best Actor. He never gave a better performance. You can see why Holden became the top male star of the fifties here. Like all great stars, he works by contrasting different aspects of his personality. His character is a wheeler-dealer in a World War II German POW camp. He'll sell or make book or anything. Nobody likes him. Well, almost nobody. He doesn't horse around with the other guys. Holden's basically polite, seemingly All-American personality is at odds with the character he plays. There's a refinement to him, a vulnerability, that doesn't really fit in with this hard guy part. Yet this works in his favor, and makes him all the more interesting to watch. This is, after all, a movie, not a stage play, and movies work differently. Holden lets us see inside his character, not a lot, but enough to know that he's basically a decent guy. It's almost obvious. To us, that is. Because we're watching a movie. But the other POW's see Holden as he projects himself to them,--as a selfish jerk. This is fine for the character, who wants to be alone anyway. We know that this is basically a defense on Holden's part. The tension between what we know and how Holden presents himself is what makes the movie so marvelous. Holden's not just good in Stalag 17, he's sublime.As to the rest of the picture, much of it's standard issue service comedy of the Mr. Roberts-Teahouse Of the August Moon kind popular at the time, only it's set in a prison camp. A nice gallows touch. No wonder Wilder was drawn to the play the movie's based on. He handles the straight suspense and intrigue stuff well enough, but overall this isn't his best work. The best scene is near the end, when the soldiers are celebrating and dancing, singing When Johnny Comes Marching Home, during which a crucial piece of information is revealed. It's a long scene, and at first seems like journeyman work, and when we realize when it's over that Holden heard everything that two characters were talking about, the effect is nearly breathtaking, and the movie, which had been a little fuzzy around the edges up till this time, comes sharply into focus, and stays there till the end.

Some, on the other hand, are poor to the point in which they're essentially garbage. Lastly, there are the greats, which also happen to be the rarest. If a pie chart could illustrate this, the fair films would maybe cover about 55 percent of the circle. The poor films would maybe cover about 35 percent. Finally, the greats would maybe only cover about 10 percent. The reason why I start my brief review off this way is because Stalag 17 is probably part of that rare 10 percent.Stalag 17 takes place in a German POW camp during World War II. Here, the captured Americans try to get by the best they possibly can -- but obviously it's not very easy. Every day at 6 AM, Sgt. Johann Sebastian Schulz (Sig Ruman) wakes them up. Following this, the men go outside, likely stand in the mud, and listen to the POW Camp Commandant -- Colonel von Scherbach (Otto Preminger) -- speak. Their sad lives also consist of soup that is tasty enough to shave with or wash your sox in, occasional letters from back home (maybe from a finance company regarding missed payments on a Plymouth), quick glimpses (from a cheap telescope) of Russian women prisoners entering showers for delousing, and every so often, a tiny amount of homemade alcohol that the house guarantees won't make you go blind. To make matters even worse, living with the American POWs is an informer helping out the Germans. Basically, if the spy can continue to manage to blend in, no secrets will ever be safe and no escapes will ever be successful.Overall, my only real complaints against this film would be that it probably could've been a bit stronger if it was slightly more realistic and if it focused a little more on the drama -- as opposed to some of the comedy. Sadly, I can easily imagine Hollywood remaking this someday. I can picture critics and moviegoers foolishly praising it, while failing to realize that not only was it already done before (as in, in 1953), but it was already great (or close enough to great) to begin with.Rating Minimum 8&#x85; Maximum 10&#x85; Let's just go with 9 out of 10 stars!

For me, the tone of the picture was all wrong, and considering it was made only eight years after World War II ended, I think it borders on the disrespectful.It all starts right at the beginning of the movie. American prisoners of war all seem to be well fed, a couple of them wear fur lined bomber jackets and even wrist watches are allowed. I had an uncle who was a prisoner of war and his weight dropped to eighty pounds; I don't think he was having the kind of 'fun' these soldiers seemed to be having. A German guard hands off his rifle to a prisoner so he could take a swat at a volleyball? A soldier washes his socks in a pot of potato soup? Russian women prisoners arrive at the camp and except for their attire, look like they might have stepped off the pages of a fashion magazine?It's not only that, but there are huge inconsistencies in the story line as well. After the escape attempt to open the picture, the Germans state that the barrack would spend it's time filling in the escape tunnel. But there was no escape tunnel, the soldiers simply descended through a trap door under the building and crawled their way out. At the finale, Sergeant Sefton (William Holden) and Lieutenant Dunbar (Don Taylor) were making their way out exactly the same way.Not to mention all the jovial camaraderie between the prisoners and Sergeant Schulz (Sig Ruman). All of this seemed so wrong to me that it detracted from the actual reveal of Price (Peter Graves) as the plant in the barrack to communicate with his superiors. That's another thing, who uses the term 'barrack' to describe a barracks? It is a real word by the way, I just looked it up, but the term 'barracks' is more properly used for both singular and plural. Just another thing to agitate me throughout the story.If the film had kept to straight drama like it did for the last half hour or so I wouldn't be going on this rant, but I really couldn't determine what director Wilder was going for here. Apparently I'm in a minority considering the complementary reviews on this board and the film's rating, but I just don't get it.

It is an adaptation of a stage play and was filmed just seven years after the end of the Second World War.Its an uneasy mixture of drama, suspense and broad comedy. Given how some British movies made in the 1960s were so pompous about the war its refreshing to see an anarchic take of the war few years after the end of hostilities.Stalag 17 is a Prisoner of War camp inside Germany with captured American personnel. The film opens with two men trying to escape who are soon captured and killed. The prisoners think that one of them is a rat and suspicion falls on Sefton (William Holden) the resident black marketeer and hence not the most popular person in the hut. Sefton's character is similar to George Segal's character in King Rat, a man who knows how to live on his wits and his mission is to survive, preferably in some comfort.Some of the comedy did not work for me, I found it irritating. It focuses on Animal who is infatuated with Betty Grable and wants to break into the nearby compound which holds Russian female POWs and his friend Shapiro. The film would had been better if they were the two characters trying to escape at the beginning of the film and shot.Yet there are some serious aspects to the film. The men are held in filthy conditions given new blankets for a few hours when the man from Geneva arrives to inspect the camp for human man rights breaches and are then quickly taken away. They receive letters from back home and find out that they are behind on their rental payments or their spouses might be cheating on them.However it looks not all of the men are American. One of them is a German inside man, placed there to find out all manner of information that could be important to the Germans. Sergeant Schultz who regularly comes into the hut and takes part in the buffoonery with the prisoners is also exchanging messages with the insider. This plot only unfolds as Sefton realises he needs to clear his name quickly and sets about to unravel the rat.I did feel that bit of the plot was not very strong. No one in that hut played chess, yet the chessboard was always out and no one seems to have noticed the knotted/unknotted cord. Also with Sefton now the prime suspect, we see the real insider asking one of the new men for information on a sabotage event that took place. Its clear that the men would eventually realise that Sefton was not the rat, especially if they managed to get Sefton out of the way like kill him.I class Stalag 17 as a curious war film which was sold as a comedy. It is neither a comedy nor a straight drama. It inspired the television series Hogan's Heroes and William Holden won a best actor Oscar for his role.

Sefton may be a heal but he's no rat.Wilder's work is one of a number of wartime comedies, but perhaps because of its vintage it hasn't aged quite so well. Some of the comedy comes too close to farce and seems at odds with the Germans' readiness to shoot escapees. Most of the gags are in the first half, after that it drifts towards a who-dunnit. Sefton sets out to discover the spy after he is beaten-up and his possessions indiscriminately plundered.There's no great shakes. Almost all of the characters are stereotypic. Some of the conflicts appear contrived. I really enjoyed it when I first saw it as a kid half a century ago, now I'm less inclined. And I'm no longer a fan of ongoing narrative in a movie. It's okay for an intro, but after that the characters and plot should speak for themselves. The viewer shouldn't need additional prompts.Still well worth a watch if you get the chance and haven't seen it before, but it's certainly no classic.

Two POWs attempt to escape from Stalag 17 (apparently, the toughest POW camp in Germany, with a perfect record.) POW Sefton (played by William Holden, in a role for which he won an Oscar) bets the others that they won't make it. They don't. Everyone suspects that there's a stoolie in Barracks 4 passing information on to the Germans. Sefton trades with the guards, and gets a lot of extra privileges from them, and so he becomes the prime suspect. From the viewer's point of view, it's pretty obvious that Sefton isn't the guy. First, it would have been way too obvious, and, second, if he had been the Germans wouldn't have made him such an obvious target. So the mystery revolves around who the stoolie actually is, and director Billy Wilder does a pretty good job of keeping us guessing. There's nothing that really gives it away until that mystery is finally revealed a little more than halfway through the movie with a rather devious question from Sefton (who's committed himself to finding out who the stoolie is) about Pearl Harbor, but the solution to one mystery leads to another - what are the POWs going to do with the real stoolie?This is a pretty decent movie. Aside from a few brief moments, it's not especially exciting, but the mystery is well enough developed that it keeps you watching all the way through. It does have a lot of unnecessary material. Animal's obsession with Betty Grable is funny for a little while, but does get tired eventually, and the whole Christmas Party in the Barracks goes on a bit too long. I also thought the whole idea of female Russian prisoners in a separate compound of the same camp (who looked - shall we say - pretty healthy!) was a real stretch to the credibility of the movie. It seems to me that this is a bit over-rated, although the story is generally good, as are the performances - Holden's, I thought (while good) being somewhat understated for a Lead Actor win. As an aside, it's interesting to note that this must have given birth to the later TV series Hogan's Heroes. There are too many similarities in the basic story to be coincidental (the toughest POW Camp in Germany from which no one escapes, the bald-headed Commandant - played here by Otto Preminger and in the series by Werner Klemperer, and even a character named Sgt.

It's a whodunnit, a slapstick comedy, a thriller, and a gritty war movie, all rolled into one. Made by people, Billy Wilder among them, who knew full well about the horrors of Nazi camps, and a mere eight years after the end of the war. And this wild concoction managed to snaffle an Oscar and was later ripped off as a TV series. Wow.While this has some hallmarks of Billy Wilder's genius, it's simply too wild a mixture. I never knew whether to laugh about the prison guards or to be afraid of them, and ended up doing neither. For the same reason the suspense doesn't work. The humour from the comedic trio Animal, Shapiro and Sgt. Schulz (Do you speaken ze German? - Ya! - Then droppen Sie dead!) or Marko The Mailman (Alright, at ease, at ease!) was a bit too low-brow and grinding for my taste, and eventually got onto my nerves.Watch out for the evil Nazi camp commander played by Otto Preminger, an Austro-Hungarian Jew like Wilder. I'm sure he had a blast in his role.While it's probably safe to say that no real POW camp was much like the depicted Stalag 17, the movie wasn't that far off the mark in many aspects. For an Anglo-American or French POW, life at such a camp probably was an ambivalent experience. I guess the jovial rapport between the prisoners and guardsman Schulz, for example, wasn't entirely without precedent. But don't make the mistake of mixing up the relatively sheltered situation at camps for Western POWs with the situation of Russian POWs (who were routinely murdered), the situation in concentration camps inside the Reich or even the large extermination camps in Eastern Europe.Incidentally, I visited the memorial site of a real Stalag the day after I saw the movie. The contrast couldn't have been bigger. While the depicted Stalag 17 was like a summer camp behind barbed wire set in idyllic California, the camp I visited was an enormous, industrialised affair, with many tens of thousands of prisoners from all around the globe. And the nearby camp of foxy female prisoners was sadly lacking.The title is erroneous, by the way. A POW camp set inside of the German empire would have been numbered with Roman numerals, i. e. Stalag XVII.Anyway, the movie. Like I said, it's a mixed bag, and hasn't aged too well. There are better Billy Wilder movies.

Two of them attempt to escape, but are killed.  The men know that there's a snitch somewhere, and they pin it on Sgt. Sefton (Holden).  This leads to all sorts of trouble, culminating in an excellent ending.The characters in this film are quite interesting, especially the cynical Sefton, whom Holden does a standout job of portraying.  Where this movie shines is in one area that is usually associated with Wilder - the sharp, witty dialogue.

Stalag 17 is escape proof. At least that's what the commandant wants you to think. But inside Barracks 4, there are several men who continually try to break out. Their attempts are always foiled, and it is assumed that someone in the barracks is a rat. The movie continues on as the men beat up on one guy they believe is the spy. *spoiler* He's not. You have to see the movie to figure out who it is, and you probably will have never guessed.Aside from the great little mystery, there are several memorable characters. Most memorable is Animal, a man who continually tries to find a way into the Russian compound because of the female POWs constantly being brought in and has a slight crush on Betty Grable. You have to see the movie to see what I mean. Shapiro, Animal's best friend and often partner in scheme. Sefton, the man who has it pretty well off because of his trading with the Germans for little luxuries. Joey, a piccolo player who has been so traumatized that he never speaks and barely even looks at anyone. It was sad to see these men being held in clearly uncomfortable conditions, to see them break down occasionally and hear of messages that seem to make them think their incarceration doesn't mean anything, like when Shapiro gets a half a dozen letters that say they want the payments for his car and then they say they've taken it, and the man whose wife said that she found a baby on their doorstep that looks exactly like her (sure).

And so, Sefton has to find out who the  informant really is, before his co-prisoners fully decide to blame and  punish him accordingly. Sounds like a really great premise, doesn't it? And  when it does focus on the premise, it sure hits the mark. Sadly, the drama  is unsustained as two characters are thrown in simply to do a comedy relief  every other scene. Obviously, someone decided that a flat-out serious WWII  drama just wouldn't have enough impact at the box office, and tried to make  it more popcorn audience-friendly with these scenes. And sadly, that's what  ruins this film. However, it is still worth it for any William Holden fans  to view the only film for which he won and Oscar, and well deserved. Holden  is cunning enough that it feels like he belongs on the modern cinema screen , as opposed to many stiff male actors of Hollywood's early year. Truly, I  believe Holden to be among cinema's first realistic, modern actors. Also, a  young Peter Graves gives a stellar performance as well.

Stalag 17 is not quite one of my favourites from Wilder but that doesn't stop it from being a classic.As always with Wilder's films, Stalag 17 visually is a very well-made film, and German PoW camp life is very effectively and accurately depicted as claustrophobic. It's beautifully photographed and atmospherically lit, still managing to look aesthetically pleasing while still making the claustrophobic setting as evocative as possible and never looking too flashy or static. As always, there is nothing really to fault Wilder's direction, his visual and writing always shines and he doesn't fail to make the story or characters interesting. Franz Waxman's score is another winner from him, stirring, luscious and haunting while always being appropriate to the film's mood and not being too syrupy.Stalag 17 has a very compelling story, with a good mix of the hilarious, the poignant and the foreboding, emotions are never forced, the pacing is both controlled and exciting, for me the comedy didn't get too much or too goofy and the suspense and tension reach nail-biting heights. The script superbly balances comedy, drama and even satire, what the film tried to be and do not once coming into question. The comedy, a lot of it deliciously dark, is genuinely funny and quite endearing, it may be too much or too goofy for some viewers (depending on whether the antics of Animal and Harry are to your tastes or not) but it appealed to me just fine, and Animal and Harry's antics were appropriately light-hearted and gave the film its heart. The drama doesn't fall into clich√©s and doesn't slow the film at all, also avoiding the mistake of some comedy-dramas seen of jarring with the comedy to the extent the film feels like two different ones. It's also very charming and poignant. The satire is sharp and biting without falling into attacking or bitterness, never does it feel like it's too much.The performances are spot-on from a top notch, and they are advantaged by the fact that the characters are interesting and their situation relatable without falling into stereotypes (even when more stylised that's even including the Germans). William Holden got a well-deserved Oscar for his powerful performance in a somewhat unsympathetic role, while Robert Strauss is funny and moving as Animal, the character that can be seen as the heart of the story, and Otto Preminger (in a surprise piece of casting, considering I know him better as a director) mesmerises as a particularly nasty character, looking like he was having a whale of a time. Harvey Lembeck, like Strauss, was part of the original Broadway run, and it's easy to see why in a fine performance that endears far more than it annoys. Sig Ruman gives a character that could have easily been a buffoonish caricature some welcome subtlety and genuine menace while clearly having a ball.Overall, another Billy Wilder classic. 10/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"An Occasionally Biting but Rousingly Entertaining Black Comedy!","Date":"16 April 2015","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, War","Review":" Stalag 17, Billy Wilder's adaptation of the 1951 Broadway hit, is a rowdily entertaining prisoner of war movie, screened as a lusty comedy-melodrama, loaded with gallant, masculine humor and the original's uninhibited earthiness The film surrounds the inhabitants of one of the myriad prisoner of war camps established by Germany during World War II &#x96; Stalag 17. When two American prisoners, attempting to escape from the camp, run into a German ambush led by German commandant, Von Scherbach (Otto Preminger), it becomes clear to the men in the barrack that they have an informer in their midst. Suspicion fastens on master trader Sergeant Sefton (William Holden), a charismatic, slick-talking yet cynical loner who irritates his camp-mates because he brazenly makes swaps and takes odds on who's going to live or die. All the men in the barracks start to suspect him of trading more than cigarettes and silk stockings with the Germans. A second betrayal seems to confirm their suspicions and he is beaten up by the men mercilessly. Of course, we're certain from the beginning that Sefton isn't the guilty party. Our cocky black- marketeer however, refuses to play the patsy and resolves to expose the traitor before embarking on his own bid for freedom. Set entirely within a WWII German prison camp for American servicemen, this serio-comedy depicts in a raw, edgy, and humorous way their daily existence, defined by cruel ironies, prickling situations, jousting schemes, rivalry feuds and oneupmanship games. Like a lot of Wilder's oeuvre, Stalag 17 is open about the comic side of lust, and that frankness, however slight, still sounds refreshingly adult. Wilder uses a suspense approach with plenty of leavening humorous byplay springing from the confinement of healthy young males. He superbly balances elements of drama, satire and comedy, and captures the claustrophobia of camp life. He also manages to extract a wonderful performance from his cast, including a truly award-winning turn by William Holden as the cocky, self- serving American prisoner and Otto Preminger, who relishes his part as a nasty Nazi.Stalag 17 has a certain humanity and realism that involves you with the intensity of its settings. Like all of Wilder's works, it is not transparently jaded, preachy or egocentric but an astounding blend of revelatory, entertaining and riveting.

The director, Billy Wilder, has opened it up a bit to show the assembly area in the middle of a dismal continental winter in Germany but most of the action takes place inside Barracks Four, where about two dozen Air Force sergeants are kept as POWs.William Holden gets the lead and is the pivotal figure but it's really an ensemble movie with memorable characters and some equally impressive scenes. It may seem a bit hokey now but when it ran on Broadway in 1951 and 1952, the war was only a few years behind us and still fresh in our memories, so what seems stilted now was news at the time.Among the two dozen inmates of Barracks Four, Holden is the odd man out, a wheeler and dealer with a treasure chest of wine, cigarettes, silk stockings, and other delicacies. The sociologist, Erving Goffman, described such places as total institutions in which life was regimented. Part of any functioning total institution was what he called the small reward system. And Holden is the savvy broker who seems to win every bet and whose prices for small rewards resemble usury. He was stuck in the role of operator for several other films, such as The Bridge on the River Kwai and Sunset Boulevard, and he was good at it.One of the better performances is Otto Preminger's as the camps commander, Colonel von Scherbach. His imperious mien is overdone to the point of hilarity. He struts about, making flippant remarks about dead bodies, has a subordinate put on his boots and then take them off again. As a director he was intimidating and authoritarian. One wonders how he took direction from Billy Wilder.Amid all the jokes and improbable events there is one moment of genuine pathos. A complete slob of a POW, Robert Strauss, gets drunk on Christmas and convinces himself that his friend, Harvey Lembeck, is really his ideal woman, Betty Grable. The men dance with each other, Strauss whispers into Lembeck's ear how much he loves her, how he dreams about her every day. When Lembeck, stunned, brings him back to reality, Strauss breaks down into a torrent of convincing tears. It's the only moment in the movie that isn't undercut by irony, cynicism, or triteness.It's a tightly written comedy/drama and not likely to be forgotten quickly.

The humour is very dated, the episode where the inmates stage their own Christmas Dance being by far the strangest where not only do we get the unseemly sight of soldiers dancing man to man, but one even drags up to impersonate Betty Grable so his chum participates.It does settle down in the last half-hour to a gripping finale as Holden uncovers the truth about the traitor in their midst and a (literally) killing-two-birds-with-one-stone escape plan is put into action (and turns out to be a real mission impossible for a young Peter Graves) but it can't make up for the uneven fare that's gone before.Only Holden really emboldens his character with anything approaching depth, the rest have as much truth about them as Snow White's seven dwarfs.As it boasts in the prologue, this was one of the first stories concentrating (sorry) on POW's but better takes on the subject were to follow, none that I can remember making the mistake of playing it for laughs.

You'd almost expect Dean and Jerry to show up in Stalag 17. In fact, Robert Strauss, who frequently showed up as the loud but stupid sergeant in some of the service comedies, appears in Stalag 17 as Animal. He was Jerry's bete noire in Jumping Jacks and Sailor Beware. Strauss's simple-minded humor is kind of fun in those other movies but not what you would expect in a picture by the sophisticated Billy Wilder. You can laugh at the first depiction of Animal's unrequited love for Betty Grable, but not at the tenth. Similarly, the sequence of men dancing with other men to romantic music is funny at first, then gets boring and even a bit disconcerting after the sequence is prolonged and the men give no further evidence that this is at least partly being done in fun. There is much other laying on too thick of humorous material that is usually seen as kid stuff.In the midst of this, we have a drama, played out by capable actors, including William Holden in a fine performance. Sig Ruman does his comical German schtik as in so many other films, and this is a humor very different from the Robert Strauss brand. Even higher on the scale of sophistication is Otto Preminger's riff on the Erich von Stroheim role in Grand Illusion.Two movies in one, then. Much of the goings on, particularly the humorous parts, seem improbable, yet the movie was based on a play by former POWs. So go figure. It's hard to imagine that being in a German prison camp would give rise to big laughs. Maybe you had to be there.On the other hand, maybe World War II has been reduced to raw material for the likes of Hogan's Heroes.

The searchlights and barbed wire, the Old World Prussian kommandant, and the elaborate escape tunnels are all here, together with the same bunch of gruff GI Joes, always cursing the krauts and moaning over dames. Who would expect a Nazi concentration camp could be such fun? The pendulum shift in tone from boyish humor to stark melodrama probably owes more to its theatrical source than to any sort of cinematic expression, but the spy-in-the-barracks plot is still effective, once the fun and games finally end. But the only member of the cast able to rise above the ranks of cardboard cutouts is William Holden, both in character and performance. As the cynical lone-wolf prisoner who bargains with the Germans for his own comfort (and draws the resentment and suspicion of his barrack mates), he single-handedly makes the film worthwhile after all this time.

Sometimes they are funny, and when they are funny, they are funny by virtue of being clever.  As well, the pacing in his movies always seems to be one of a sense of urgency, as if every moment is important.  There is really never meandering and wasted moments.  At least in his best works.  Unfortunately this movie is not one of his best works.  It is just okay. The problem with the movie is that it takes a while to get off the ground and there never really seems to be a sense of urgency and real tension, not until about the last half hour that is(and that saves this movie).  The comedy is more infantile, and mostly produced by a character called Animal.  However, Animal comes off as more annoying than funny, and is over the top.  A poor directional choice from the usually outstanding Wilder.  It seems that the movie tried to take itself seriously, without ever really doing it.  William Holden gives a fine performance, and was really the only character that came off as interesting.  However, he was in another POW movie called 'The Bridge on the River Kwai'.  All though the latter isn't a movie that makes the greatest philosophical statement, it is much more entertaining throughout than this movie is.  In all fairness, this is a fairly well directed movie, and if it was directed by John Hughes or Chris Columbus then it might be considered a greater achievement.  As it stands, Wilder did work that was much better than this, so the expectations are high, and it didn't meet them.  Still, the last half hour saves what would have otherwise been a wasted experience.  7 out of 10.

Stalag means prison in German and this movie deals with the POW's of Stalag 17. This particular prison has surprisingly all sergeants as inmates who are continuously trying to flee prison but in vain. After the death of two of their companions in a bid to escape, they suspect a spy amidst them. Their main suspect is a flamboyant Sgt. J.J.

To prove his innocence, Sefton decides to find the real culprit. Is he successful in his conquest and who is the 'real' spy is the basis of the story. Wilder in his inimitable style has not kept this movie an all serious affair. This is actually a very light-hearted thriller drama which makes you laugh all along. I personally feel this movie inspired some of the scenes in the greatest POW movie ever 'The Great Escape'. This movie has got a gang of characters.

The Great Escape is a much grander scale movie with many heroes. The Allies are all true to each other, no rats or spies. Maybe the fact that soldiers appearto turn on one of their own is upsetting. Frankly it's not believable to me that Sefton would survive his beating. If the boys felt he really was a spy they would have killed him. Wilder's film spends as much time with men dancing with men or dressed in drag, presumably comic relief, as the spy story.

He's the one with the chest full of prime stuff, while everyone else slogs their way through with nary a cooked egg to their name. But Holden's wily ways catch up to him his cynicism and willingness to bet on men failing to escape earn him the enmity of almost everyone in the camp. And when it becomes apparent that there is an informer among the men, probably selling info to the Germans, he naturally becomes the prime suspect. This soon earns him a beating and a reputation lower than the lowest rat. His only option ferret out the real informer and clear his own name. There ain't much to celebrate for any of these jokers, having to spend the Holiday in prison overseas. Director Billy Wilder, known for his comedies, instills a sense of humor in scenes involving the German guards, to the point of making them all look clownish. In this day, this calls to mind the TV Series Hogan's Heroes - a comparison I'm sure the filmmakers did not have in mind. So, amid the death & drudgery, we have a few laughs.

The story concerned WWII American POWs held in a Nazi camp--but it combined serious drama with broad farce and offered one of the first anti-heroes in American film in the leading role. With the war still very fresh in every one's mind, the combination seemed more likely to offend than appeal. Every one concerned held their breath when the film debuted would audiences get it? They did indeed, and STALAG 17 became one of the most critically-lauded and commercially popular films of the early 1950s, picking up an Academy Award nomination for director Billy Wilder and a Best Actor Oscar for William Holden in the process.The story concerns American prisoners of war held in the German Stalag 17 in 1944, and it begins grimly after much planning, the Americans have devised an escape for two of their number, but the next morning the bullet-riddled bodies of the two men are dragged into camp and dumped in the mud. But the escape plan should have worked. It was perfect. How did the Germans know? Suspicion begins to settle on J.J. Sefton (Holden), a bitter cynic and hardbitten opportunist who spends his time running various scams designed to strip his fellow prisoners of what little they have.While this might have worked as drama pure and simple, the film counterbalances its darkness with streaks of a sort of boys will be boys broad farce played out in the most over-the-top way imaginable. And strange to say, even given the overplaying typical of the early 1950s, the balance works for every dramatic twist there is a stroke of comedy, and for every stroke of comedy there is a dramatic twist. In Wilder's hands the ensemble cast, which includes the likes of Otto Preminger and Peter Graves, performs some of the most remarkable juggling of the decade. But the glue here is William Holden. Interestingly, according to most sources Holden hated the play and hated the character and did the project under duress. Whatever the case, he gives a truly remarkable performance Sefton is not a likable man by any stretch of the imagination, but even so he has certain self-integrity that you cannot help but admire. While Holden is now probably best remembered for his performances in SUNSET BLVD and NETWORK, his work here is likely the finest of his entire career.There has been some complaint that STALAG 17 is disrespectful to WWII prisoners of war, for it paints their Nazi captors as buffoons and camp conditions as not so much horrific as merely unpleasant--and it is true that the film makes no serious portray the extreme difficulties most POWs encountered. But to say that it is disrespectful to POWs is akin to saying that 42nd STREET is disrespectful to chorus girls we know, just as 1953 audiences knew, that this is not an attempt to portray reality; it is instead a story told via our willing suspension of disbelief--and a very entertaining story it is indeed.

I think that this film is one of the best I have ever seen. The direction in Stalag 17 was not noticeable enough to make a difference in how I felt about the movie; it seemed rather simple. The one thing I did notice about the direction was the length of the shots. This, in contrast to films that come out nowadays, was highly surprising. I do not know how many takes Wilder must have gone through to get everything the way he wanted, but with that volume of actors having to put together coherent lines in one take, it must have taken a long time. This does make the film better than if there were a lot of cuts back and forth, because being in a prisoner of war camp having fewer cuts lends to the monotony of the endless days of being in capture. Given this, I feel that the direction of this film fit the plot perfectly, and could not have been done any better.This film was filled with both drama and comedy, but was easily the funniest of the Wilder films we have watched so far. One character that I really enjoyed was Feldwebel Johann Sebastian Schulz, whom the prisoners simply referred to as Shultz. The fact that he was a German who was stationed at the prisoner of war camp lends the viewer to believe he will be a complete jerk. However, he comes of as hilarious and just doing his job. One line in this film that I really enjoyed was spoken directly to Schultz.Hey Schultz, sprechen Sie Deutsch?JaThen droppen Sie dead! Now, normally, a German working at a POW camp, upon hearing this directed at him, would go completely nuts and probably kill the prison who said this to him. In this case, however, good old Schultz jovially laughed and played along with the prisoner. This movie, unlike other early Wilder films, seemed a little far-fetched, and I do not believe that these people would act and converse in the way that they do in reality. At least, I do not think that the prisoners and the guards would interact in the way that they do in the film.One actor who really stood out in this film was William Holden. I am quickly becoming a huge fan of his, as I enjoyed him in Sunset Boulevard and even more so in Stalag 17. I love how upon finding out that Price is indeed the traitor in the camp, Holden's character, Sergeant J.J. Sefton, waits until the perfect time to let the cat out of the bag. Instead of just calling Price out on it right away, Sefton waits until it is most advantageous to him and his freedom to out Price. This was done very well. Also, I enjoyed the flashbacks of Sefton's antics, which included mouse races and a telescope to peep on the nude Russian girls. This was hilarious.As for the music, it fit the film well. It did not stand out as being out of place, which is always good. The special effects, though few and far between, were pretty bad. It was not believable that those people were actually being shot in the movie, but it does not distract from the film at all. The costuming and scenery was all very believable. I believed that I was watching events unfold in a German POW camp. Well done, Wilder!

He somehow has to prove that he isn't the mole, and more importantly, he has to prove WHO IS the mole.This is a thrilling and funny film that leaves you guessing.

However, it seems obvious that the treatment of our WWII POW's was far worse than depicted.  As such, in light of some of the recent films dealing with WWII, this movie screams for a remake.  I believe Kevin Spacey would be superb as Sefton (perhaps as good as Holden) and Matt Damon would make a good Price. I strongly encourage the Hanks and Spielberg combo to create a version of the story in the same vein as Saving Private Ryan...it could be huge! "}]
