A Puppet Master Box Set was released in 2000 by Full Moon, but was quickly recalled by Paramount because they still claimed the rights to these films.

Director JEFF BURR (Who became the first director to helm a PUPPET MASTER movie & not be named David) steers the series back to it's darker horror movie roots, that were seemingly abandon in PUPPET MASTER III TOULON'S REVENGE. His direction is really good & he knows how to direct horror movies because it's clear he is a horror fan himself. I knew the series was in good hands with him at the helm, since I've been utterly impressed with his roster of films. What should be noted is how this sequel does away with any sexual elements & tones the gore down a bit (though it is still somewhat bloody) & adds a more fantasy like element to it. It also continues with the idea of the puppets once again being good guys & not evil as they were seen in the first two outings. This was mainly due to the amount of fan mail Producer Charles Band received from kids, who claimed they were big fans of the series & would even send him drawings of their favourite puppets. As is tradition with the series, the film adds a new puppet named Decapitron a head master that can change multiple heads & is really a channeller for Toulon's spirit to enter into. This is a very interesting puppet indeed, since Producer Band had a movie in production way back in the 80's that would feature this puppet, that unfortunately never happened when his EMPIRE PICTURES outfit crumbled into extinction. Sadly along with TORCH, this puppet would only be used in two movies, before being jettisoned with no mention of it's whereabouts after PART 5. The acting is well above par for the genre. GORDON CURRIE really shines as the likable college wiz kid & JASON ADAMS is perfection as his smart, but not as smart & very jealous, stuck up rival. While CHANDRA WEST is appealing as Rick's (GORDON CURRIE) girlfriend Susie. THERESA HILL is interesting as Susie's friend, a Channeler psychic. What I really enjoyed about this entry, is how it never lets up from start to finish, always providing us with new information & adds more back story to the serum. The plot is fun & the film features some good suspenseful moments, atmosphere & tension. The late David Allen really tops himself here, the puppet effects are pretty awesome & some of the best stop motion animation the series has to offer by far. The story in & of itself is very engaging & really easy & interesting enough to get sinked into. The Totem creatures are also a very interesting addition to the PUPPET MASTER fold & make for great villains for the puppets. The set design is really good, the totem puppets weird & creepy, in fact they have an almost Aztec like quality to them.On the downside though, there were a few things that kind of bugged me, but nothing to to spoil the fun of the movie The SUTEK demon although an interesting character & creation is to rubbery looking to be taken seriously & you could tell it was a puppet, since it moved like one. I also had trouble stomaching the idea that the Bodega Bay Inn was open yet again for business, despite it's bloody history & the fact that the murderer(s) were never caught (the puppets themselves). I mean there is no way the authorities & government would allow it & even if they did, who would want to spend a night at an Inn, where a whole bunch of people were horribly mutilated on two separate occasions? The film also leaves some questions unanswered like Whatever became of Camille, who became the puppets new master at the end of Part II? didn't her & the puppets leave the Bodega Bay Inn at the end of that movie? if so, why are the puppets back at Bodega Bay Inn again? Wasn't Toulon evil in Part II? if so, why do the puppets trust in Toulon again after he turned his back on them? Why is he a good guy yet again? the only answer I could come up with, was that this was Producer CHARLES BAND's idea of turning him good again, since the fan response was really positive for the character in III & they really grew to like the character in that film, since he was so sympathetic. Lastly, where was TORCH? despite being on the video box art, he is nowhere to be found here & no answers are given as to his whereabouts? where was Six Shooter in Parts 1 & 2? plus if the film takes place after II, & the puppets were weak from having no fluid in that one, then why are they all asleep here, but BLADE isn't? since he is still roaming around the Inn, does he not need serum too? & didn't TUNNLER die in PUPPET MASTER II? if so how is he alive here?See PUPPET MASTER LEGACY for a correct chronological order of the series.In the end, PUPPET MASTER 4 is a very fun movie & a real treat for fans of the series. It's got all the things really fun & great sequels have, new elements & plot twists, more story with plenty of interesting avenues explored, better effects, better acting, great directing, a fun story & just enough suspense, tension & gore added & some fun & interesting villains to help make it one of the best in the series. Even after all these years the film never loses it's freshness & still manages to entertain you, despite having viewed it multiple times (which I have over the years) but question Did they really need five writers to make an 80 minute movie & it's sequel?

The first, a small bug, is the buildup, which like in 1 or 2 takes a bit. The second, a much larger issue, is that the plot seems to feel very scrapped together, like a bunch of little pieces of a script. So when it's all patched together it feels a little disjointed. The third, another problem, is the lack of blood. I don't mean gore I mean blood. Other than a severed finger the action is never violent or bloody enough to be horror-y.

Director Jeff Burr relates the entertaining premise at a brisk pace, maintains a generally serious tone throughout, makes neat occasional use of funky stop-motion animation, and delivers a generous sprinkling of gore. This film further benefits from solid acting from a capable cast pretty Chandra West as Rick's sweet girlfriend Susie, Jason Adams as smug and jealous jerk Cameron, and foxy Teresa Hill as sensitive psychic Lauren. Gulf Rolfe makes a welcome return appearance as Andre Toulon while Felton Perry has a regrettably small part as amiable scientist Dr. Carl Baker. The gremlin creatures are real gnarly. Moreover, it's cool to see the puppets as the good guys for a change. The tight 80 minute running time ensures that this movie never gets dull or overstays its welcome. Adolfi Bartoli's crisp cinematography gives the picture a pleasing polished look. Richard Band's spirited score hits the nicely spooky spot. Worth a watch for fans of this franchise.

Here, in the fourth instalment we see a demonic creature out to destroy anything associated with the eponymous puppet master, Anton Toulon himself. The subjects of his wrath? The lethal and animate toys Toulon created, as well as an improbably young scientist working on a project to bring life to the inanimate and a clutch of his witless friends and associates. Sound dreadful? Well, it's not. Harking back to the glory days of American horror, this is retro stuff that feels as if it was made ten years before it actually was. And that's a good thing, kids. Trust me, if the only horror you have seen is 'Shrooms, Thir13en ghosts and other such nonsense that gets the green light in modern horror cinema, you really are missing out and would do well to check out pretty much anything pre 1989 as an educational experience. Whilst the production levels and acting are bordering on the inane, this has atmosphere by the bucket load. In truth, the Puppet Master movies feel like really dark kids films, as there is next to nothing in the way of gore or violence, though this one at least has an entertaining death scene near the start which is relatively tense. Special mention must go to the metal soundtrack, which was great, as well as the device used to end the demonic menace The Decapitron, a puppet with the power of mimicry.

For the start of the movie we are introduced to the caretaker of Bodega Bay Inn (Gordon Currie) and some youth friends of his (many of the cast are Canadian and are all very good in unfortunately rather undemanding roles - Teresa Hill is quite yummy). Totems, minions of the Egyptian God Sutek want the secret of animation life back and the puppets (when they surface) act with a previously unseen cleverness to attempt to destroy the ugly and very computer game looking Totems. The Totems merely complicate the series and distract from the things that previously made the series so unique - they don't share the weird beauty of the puppets and thus don't really fit in. Top scene is Pinhead using a rag to clean blood from Tunnelers drill bit, classic and about the goriest this film goes. The fifth film was filmed concurrently with this one so expect similar sections of mediocre and a Toulon performance that seems to have been filmed in a different era (or even galaxy).

So Sutekh (the demon) sends the totems, a bunch of craven little creatures that look like ear-less gremlins.  Then it's up to the puppet troupe to take care of the inter-dimensional threat that's trying to kill there new friends.Like most low budget movies this film is rife with continuity problems.

Why would a contractor by a building with a history of mass murders?  All this and many more questions,  will not be answered...ever.The real suprise of this movie is the acting.  It's actually pretty good.  The actors take it with a enthusiasm unusual especially for a bunch of Full Moon nonames.  Teresa Hill was especially impressive as the shy, nervous, psychic Lauren.  Chandra West (Susie) was also a pleasant suprise also.  Gordon Hill was a tolerable protagonist.  But Cameron was far too annoying to stomach.  Thank the norse god he dies before halfway through.The puppets are there usual animated selves.  With some improvements as well.  There emotions (especially Jester's) are much more human due to the sounds that have been given to them.  Blade's hisses, Pinhead's grunts, and Six-Shooter's snicker have all been improved and sound much better.  The stop-motion animation is only average at best, especially the totems. They just don't seem to move as fluidly as the previous installment in the series.  Also the Sutekh costume is absolutely awefull.  How are we supposed to afraid of a creature so humorous looking.The story seems a bit juvinile for the series.  I think Charlie Band was looking to focus in on a younger demographic.  The violence being toned down in this movie also seems to speak the same.  Gore fans will be disappointed.I think the above is the main problem this movie can't really stick with many people.  It doesn't have the violence for gorewhores.  The language is a little cleaner.  Yet it's too violent and harsh for the wee ones.  Which is why the movie gets low ratings.

Burr had previously worked on Band's The Vault, but the film never came out. At this meeting, Burr was offered parts 4 and 5 for Puppet Master and two parts of Oblivion. At this time, Full Moon was largely backed financially by Paramount.Someone concerned with the continuity points out In Toulon's Revenge, Andre Toulon escaped Berlin somewhere between 1942 and 1944. Toulon committed suicide on March 15, and the film mentioned the Eastern Front, whose conduct of operations didn't take place until summer of 1941. In this film, Toulon's diary recounts Major Krauss's death as being on April 7. Since in previously established timelines, Toulon made it to America almost one year after escaping, Toulon would have to had killed himself on March 15 either in 1943 up to 1945.Who is this concerned? Puppet Master may be one of the worst horror franchises out there. Possibly not the very worst, because Hellraiser (for example) has really gone downhill to low, low depths. But really, this is Charles Band cheese, luckily saved by Jeff Burr, one of the best directors in the genre.The film is not all bad. The casting is strange and the acting is poor, but the effects are decent. Not great, as they never are in the series, but the introduction of the demons is nice and they're way better than any of the puppets. Apparently Burr had only limited impact on the casting, as he wanted Judy Geeson for a role but Charlie Band overruled him and handpicked his own actress.If you love movies, especially these lower budget movies, pick up this disc with Jeff Burr's audio commentary. Burr really needs to write an autobiography, as his memory is incredible and he is an excellent storyteller. He finds a way to fit 200 minutes worth of discussion into a less-than-90 minute film. His reflections on Albert Band and puppetry and everything else are priceless.

Nevertheless I didn't really liked how the puppets are turned into the good guys (although you could say that was the case in the third film, but I preferred that one's revenge angle) facing off against a Sutek the ancient Eygptian God and its minions that can control totems, but credit is due to somewhat (as some familiar staples do crop up) not completely repeating itself.

The only two that didn't appear were leech woman and torch.The whole angle has the puppets finding a new master and protecting him from the demon who wants to destroy the late Andre Toulon's work and the tone has kind of changed, while some dark glimmers I didn't find it all that creepy (with nastiness mainly occurring off-screen) and even the cliff side hotel they occupy doesn't have that dominating presence either. Some instances fell on the funny side, but the change of pace and whole drama moves by quick enough.

There is the absence of that quiet, almost fairytale, quality found in previous instalments, noticeable right from the opening score.I tried to be patient with this film- and indeed the opening, which focuses on other worldly demons who wish to guard the secret of life as tapped into by Toulon, feels like it has the potential to be interesting, something new, a further exploration of the puppet master mythology perhaps.But it's wasted potential- nothing is explored in any kind of depth. This is especially disappointing in contrast to the thoughtful Puppet Master III. Up until now Puppet Master's puppets have always played a relatively small part in a greater story. Yes they probably are the reason people rent these movies, but we are treated to a lot more than just puppets killing people- there's interesting character development, some great building of tension, a rich past to explore but this film focuses mainly upon the puppets themselves, and these demonic critters sent from another dimension.The whole cat/ mouse feel of the action gets really tiresome. It's just not fun to watch the same scream, struggle a bit then eventually kill the baddie routine over and over again in this movie. There's a genuine lack of tension as well. For example we see the puppet master's chest being prised open for about five minutes. The audience knows what will be inside- we've seen the other films, and yet we're forced to sit through this. Why? That isn't tension- a revelation, isn't a revelation if we already know what to expect.Everything feels overly forced too. The boy-genius in his Converses who enjoys jumping around his room firing lasers at robots because he's crazy fun! too. He's not especially likable, he just feels like some, I dunno, Micheal J Fox in-the-80s throwback. The techno-babble is another annoying aspect of this film- we know means nothing so why bother? Even the selling point of this chapter- when bad puppets go good! is redundant because we've seen these puppets as justice-givers in the previous instalment. It's just really a sad contrast to the interesting characters we've met in previous instalments and the simplistic charm of those films too.The sad news is this was filmed back-to-back with its sequel Puppet Master 5. I have the box set, so I'm inevitably going to watch it, but I'm not excited. I don't care about this badly executed plot. The characters aren't interesting to me.

About the only good thing in the film is the stop motion work by Dave Allen and his crew, but it seems to be less and less with each entry. This marks a turning point with the tiny terrors being full blown good guys now. This was also the first in the PM series to feature no nudity. PUPPET MASTER 4 came out in November 1993 and the fifth entry, despite being filmed back-to-back, came out almost a year later in September 1994. Felton Perry has two scenes as a murdered scientist.

It is basically choose your series, the first two go together and paint the puppets as killers, while the next three are a series of them being the good guys. This one plays out to much like some cheesy television series episode to be as good as part three was and I never really had the urge to try and watch part five of the series. Basically, a kid gets the puppets while some strange dark lord or something sends his evil puppets out to kill, this dark lord looks like some sort of enemy from one of those live action Japanese shows like Ultraman. The movie is over before you know it though so it has to get credit for not inflicting you with a very painful to watch movie. Just to many plot holes and things in it for it to be considered an okay movie. You do get to see the guy who played Toulon in the last movie though then you have a very anti-climatic battle and wham the movie is over before it really begins. "},{"Title":"What on Earth?? What were they thinking?","Date":"17 January 2007","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" So I decided to watch the entire Puppet Master series, and had just watched parts 1-3, which I thought were ALL excellent. They had a unique charm to them, and a certain intelligence that I really appreciated. About a year ago, I even saw Puppet Master Vs. Demonic Toys, which of course was bad, but still a terrific guilty pleasure and fun to watch.From the very beginning of this film, I knew it was in trouble. The cheesy Power Rangers-style Egyptian skull villain who watches the Puppets 'Rita Repulsa-style' through his pyramid glass came straight out of left field! All of the additions to this franchise in this story were completely absurd! Suddenly we have a grand assortment of all kinds of new and random characters and plots that are a far cry from the first three films. I seriously doubt that when the first Puppet Master was being penned, the writers had visions of someday seeing an Egyptian Power Rangers villain, totem monsters, annoying twenty-somethings who seriously can't act (and are supposed to be brilliant scientists but never say anything intelligent), and a lame Decapitron puppet who's head can morph into the ghost of Toulon.Another thing that greatly disappointed me in this film was that it completely ignores what happened in the last entry (Part II, since III was a prequel). Suddenly, the puppets are back at Bodega Bay Inn, back in their case (minus Blade), and Toulon for some reason is willing to help his puppets again (he betrays them in part II for his love of Elsa). This isn't explained AT ALL...and so with that, and all of this other junk thrown in, I was no longer amused.I'm a huge fan of ridiculous B movies, a connoisseur if you will. I even collect laser discs of rare B movies you can't find on DVD, and so it takes a lot for me to say that this was one of the most absurd movies I have ever seen in my life. I still love those puppets, the original ones, Blade, Tunneler, Pinhead, Jester and the rest, and if they had only stuck with what they had rather than trying to fix something that wasn't broken, well, the series might still be alive and in good health. That being said, even though the reviews aren't so great, I'm really interested in checking out Puppet Master Retro, sounds like an interesting one that pays great tribute to the original themes.

I've Seen All of Them Except Part 5, and Let me Tell You, I have Gotten Thrills, Chills, and Enjoyment out of Every Single One. In This One, we Have some of The Same Good Things we Find in Part One. Mainly A Psychic, A Team of Researchers, and Most Importantly, Good Scares! However, Unlike The Original, This time we Find Something New. A Few little Demons who want to Steal Back the Magic that Andre Toulon Stole from Them. Sounds Stupid? It isn't. I Even think It was Good for The Series to take a bit of a Twist. I also Thought it was Nice that the Puppets became the Good Guys. Because in The Three Previous Films, We Learn that The Puppets Will Obey any Command from The Puppet Master. Also in The Three Previous Films, The Puppet Master has used the Puppets for Their own Evil. I Think This Film also tries to Tell you That It is not The Puppets who are the Bad Guys, It's the People that Abuse the Puppets' Power.  In Case you Already Haven't Heard, You Should Know that this is The Newest Puppet's Debut Film. His Name is Decapitron, and He is the Most Shocking and Powerful of Them All. It's War and Chaos as The Puppets Fight off The Pesky little Demons as They Protect Themselves, The People stuck in the Hotel, and Most Importantly, The Magic of Life. The Graphics were also Remarkable because The Actually looked like They Were Walking, as to Where in Scenes from Previous Films They looked Like they were Floating or Hovering. As Well as A New Puppet Showing Up, a Few Puppets are Absent. The Absent Puppets are Torch and Ms. Leech.   This Film was so Fun to Watch and I Would Hope that There wasn't a Person in the World who Didn't Like it. I Also Thought the Puppets were a Little More Fun to Watch, Because they are Funny and Curious. All in All, We are left with a Good Film with Plenty of Thrills and Excitement to Go Around. A Pure Joyride. 10 out of 10.

In this third sequel, the human characters and the infamous puppets are forced to battle the forces of darkness in the shape of a towering demonic baddie, Zutek, and the evil Totems (think gremlins but with less personality).It's a feel-good horror movie but with a few genuine scares thrown in early on (a first for the Puppet Master series). The film is ably directed by Jeff Burr (Leatherface) and moves at a cracking pace.The cast do a decent job and there's even the introduction of a new puppet for the film's finale.All in all, a great popcorn horror film that leaves the viewer hungry for the next (but not final) instalment.

Susie notices a strange puppet & Rick say's it's been there since he moved in, then Lauren feels something evil about it & leads the friends to a large chest in a forgotten storage room & several other strange puppets inside it as well as the diary of German toymaker & puppeteer Andre Toulon (Guy Rolfe) which describes a green serum which can animate the puppets & give them life which by an odd coincidence is just the thing that Rick is working on. Meanwhile Sutek the ancient Eygptian God whom Toulon stole the reanimation secret from in the first place wants it back & sends various little monsters out to get it & kill anyone who has learned about it starting with Rick, his chums & Toulon's puppets...Originally having the working title Puppet Master 4 The Demon this was directed by sequel specialist Jeff Burr whose other credits include Stepfather II (1989), Leatherface Texas Chainsaw Massacre III (1990), Pumpinhead II Blood Wings (1994) as well as the following Puppet Master sequel Puppet Master 5 (1994) which was actually made at the same time as Puppet Master 4 & continues the story with pretty much the same cast of actor's & character's (here in the UK ironically Puppet Master 5 was the only one never to be released on video or DVD so that means the only Puppet Master to follow on directly from the previous one storyline wise was never released!). I must admit that I am a huge fan of the first three Puppet Master flicks which I consider to be Full Moon's best films with some strong storytelling, neat special effects & gore & some memorable killer puppets each with their own distinct personality & implement's for killing but this is the point where that stops & the Puppet Master series starts to turn into a cheap horror franchise aimed at making money & selling replica dolls to the fans. Amazingly Puppet Master 4 has five credited on screen writers which I find astonishing, I mean it took five people to write this? While there are elements of the screenplay & plot that I like I have to say some of this sucks big time & some of the plot elements that are newly introduced like the Egyptian God Sutek, the laser fights & the scientific artificial intelligence angle are poor. Event at only 75 minutes long not much actually happens, out of the four main teenage cast members only one is killed & I didn't like the fact that the Toulon puppets don't get to do anything & aren't used as the main threat which ends up falling to Sutek's little monsters which are forgettable & don't have any particular stand out features.A lot of the previous Puppet Master films continuity is forgotten about or ignored here as well, I mean where's Torch from Puppet Master II (1991) which this follows? Although having said that Torch does appear in Puppet Master 5. The character of Andre Toulon has been completely rewritten & changed which doesn't help & the puppets which were once so cool & so deadly are turned into the hero's here & actually protect Rick & his mates from Sutek. The majority of the special effects are surprisingly good with simple yet very effective stop-motion animation & animatronic puppet effects used throughout, I just wish the puppets were meaner & had been given more to do. The only really terrible effect is the awful rubber monster suit that is supposed to pass as Sutek the Demon God. The gore levels are low, someone has their finger cut off & there's some mild blood splatter but this feels like it was made for a PG rating & if there hadn't been some 'F' word swearing it would surely have gotten that PG rating.Production wise Puppet Master 4 is pretty good, the wonderful location used for the Bodega Bay Inn scenes really help as I'm sure the production team would have struggled to build sets that were half as good & anywhere near as atmospheric. The cinematography is quite nice on occasion with some moody lighting & a power cut coupled with a good thunder storm going on outside with sporadic lightning flashes always helps the feel. The acting is alright by a fairly young & attractive cast (especially the two leading girls who are hot!) most of whom return for the next one Puppet Master 5.Puppet Master 4 has a few good points like the return of the puppets & some nice special effects & one or two good moments but it's nowhere near as good as the first three & you can tell the producers are milking the franchise & see it as a money making exercise rather than anything else, or maybe I'm just being too cynical? Splitting what would have sat happily as one long film into two 70 odd minute ones along with turning the once killer puppets into the good guy's & reducing the gore & nudity to virtually zero probably say's it all really. "},{"Title":"The Worst of the Series So Far","Date":"9 October 2011","Score":"0 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" Puppet Master 4 (1993) * 1/2 (out of 4) A teenage genius (Gordon Currie) is working on an Omega Project, which is meant to contact artificial intelligence. Along the way he stumbles onto puppet master Andre Toulon's puppets, which he brings to life just in time because some evil alien/demons have come to steal the magical potion. The most shocking thing in PUPPET MASTER 4 happens during the opening credits when you see that it took five writers to come up with this film and it only clocks in at 75-minutes. I'm really not sure why five writers were needed but it appears that all of them fell asleep at their typewriters. This here is clearly the worst in the series so far and that's a real shame especially considering the fact that the previous two were actually fairly good and delivered quite a bit of entertainment. This fourth installment just comes off incredibly silly and even worse is that this is when the screenwriters decided to take the puppets and turn them into good guys wanting to help out the humans. Blade, the most memorable puppet from the first three movies, makes his return here but he doesn't even get the use the instrument that he's named after. Six-Shooter, Pinhead and Tunneler aren't given much to do either and you really have to wonder why they even bothered to include them. Those expecting any type of violence or gore are certainly going to be disappointed as this thing here is pretty much PG-rated. That's pretty funny considering director Jeff Burr had just gotten done with LEATHERFACE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE 3, which had all sorts of problems due to its gore and violence so perhaps the director was just playing it safe here. With the five screenwriters you'd think that they at least write one good, memorable character but that's not the case. The four teens are all rather annoying and poorly written. Toulon appears for a matter of minutes and his screen time is also wasted. PUPPET MASTER 4 certainly shows its low-budget as it seems they were working with even less money than before. The special effects aren't nearly as good but even if they were better it's doubtful they would have saved the film. "}]
