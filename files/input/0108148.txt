Cantonese / English subtitles.I first saw 'Iron Monkey' on an old, poor-quality VHS release with dodgy English subtitles placed underneath really big and bright Chinese subtitles that took up half of the screen space. You know the type I'm talking about. Even then, my immediate reaction was AWESOME WOW AWESOME.The corrupt officials of a Chinese province find themselves the target of Iron Monkey (Rongguang Yu), a sort of Chinese Robin Hood. When Wong Kei Ying (Donnie Yen) and a young Wong Fei Hung (Sze-Man Tsang) arrive in town, Kei Ying is forced to help the corrupt authorities track down Iron Monkey. Naturally, things get complicated when a group of Shaolin rebels arrive in town. Led by Hin Hung (Yee Kwan Yan) these evil Shaolin Monks and Nuns have been paid take out our heroes, leaving Iron Monkey, Kei Ying, Fei Hung, and Miss Orchid (Jean Wang) to kick many an evil-doers arse.The story in 'Iron Monkey' serves only as a device to allow for more fighting. Things that might usually be kept secret are revealed nearly straight away, just to avoid any major plot twists and allow for more kung-fu time. In fact, in 'Iron Monkey', kung-fu time occurs much more frequently then plot-development time, and whenever a plot-development moment comes along, it usually accompanied by kung-fu time. Awesome.We all know that Donnie Yen and Rongguang Yu are awesome. They spend a good deal of time putting on some awesome fight scenes. Jean Wang and Sze-Man Tsang (who, in Monkey Magic style, is actually a girl) pull of some really cool action sequences. Granted, most of it is grounded in fantasy, much like 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' and friends, but it still looks really cool, and a few of these fights are easily some of my favourite fight-scenes ever. Also, the technique names rule. I wish I could perform a no-shadow kick or a King Kong palm.'Iron Monkey' is nearly nothing but martial arts fantasy. Fans of Hong Kong wuxia movies will get a kick out of this, as will action fans in general. Fans of 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon', 'Hero', and 'House of Flying Daggers' should see this to see how wuxia should be done, but they may not like it. Fantastic action movie - 9/10 "},{"Title":"Great Entertainment","Date":"19 January 2004","Score":"17 out of 17 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":"  This is by far one of the top 10 martial art movies of all time.This movie has beautiful scenery and atmosphere.  It transport me back to a place long ago and far away where life is cruel and government officials are corrupt but all is not forsaken for heroes are out there with heart of pure goodness, body of iron armor, and spirit of courage and valor. This movie made me believe in this world where human can train their body and mind to do inhuman feats like leaping onto roof tops and shattering cement blocks two feet thick.  It invoked memories of my childhood dream of becoming a martial art master able to kick butt but also the restraint and pathos for helping those less fortunate.  Both  Dr Yang and  Wong Kei-Ying plays a martial art hero that possess these traits.  They are well rounded individuals that posses other admirable skills.  Dr Yang for example is a highly skilled doctor, a flashy cook, and a musician.  I love one of the breath taking scenery in which he was playing this Chinese instrument out in the court yard on a golden autumn day.  It's very nostalgic for me for some reason.  Orchid, Dr Yang's assistant is wonderful in this movie as well. She brought beauty and depth to this movie.  The young Wong Fei-hung character was great as well.  These wonderful characters on top of the amazing fight sequences makes this movie transcend martial art movies and rival any movies genre ever produced in terms of sheer entertainment value. I have read review about the bad/simple plot or fake wire-fu in this movie. That's not the point, the mastery of mood and texture in this movie is sheer enjoyment.  How much plot can one develop in a 90 minute martial art movie?...or any movie really...it's all about the human conditions some more complex than other often recycled over and over through the years and placed in a different setting and different context.  Great movies capture the human imagination and touches a spectrum of human emotions.  Great movies also flow smoothly and do not go into a lull. For me this movie did that and more.   Hopefully you'll want to watch it again and again like I did.

Whether it's bodies slamming through tables, hopping from roof to rooftop, there's so much action, then story, then more action!!! Donnie Yen's martial arts is impressive and his character is very straight to the point, but very noble.  Guang as Dr. Yang is heroic as well and plays his dual role very well.  Most of best battles have both men sharing the screen with lightning speed quickness!!  Tsang is good as young Wong Fei Hung and the beautiful Jean Wang is visually pleasing to watch as Miss Ho (who can also whoop butt).  Master Fox provides  funny moments too.Overall, the main emphasis here is the martial arts.  The bad guys are very bad (including one deadly renegade monk) and the action is intense.  Besides shadowless kicks and King Kong fists, weapons used vary from staffs & swords to umbrellas, benches, and very sharp tacks (OUCH!)  The finale is mind-blowing and is like nothing I've ever seen before.

In Iron Monkey, one scene I admire most is the poetically quiet, beautiful interaction of fluid movements in graceful progression as Dr. Yang and Miss Orchid close shop (the clinic), a whiff of wind blows the papers (written prescriptions) up in the air, and Yang (who's actually Iron Monkey) elevates himself up into the air to catch the flying papers, while Orchid, with a few agile movements and glides, catches the balance of the flying papers. It's like a short interlude - a silent romantic song with punctuated accents - with a slight kick from Miss Orchid, a stool plops into place upside down as it should be on another neatly ends the piece. I actually relish this quiet segment much more than the awe-struck extensive finale scene, which is truly an amazing display of exquisitely choreographed martial art movements of three masters (two good forces tenaciously team up against one skillful evil monk) on multiple wooden poles with inferno-like fire a-dancing below. Fantastic performances from Donnie Yen as Wong Kei-ying, father of Wong Fei-hung, who's deftly portrayed by a young girl Tsang Sze-man, and Yu Rongguang as Dr. Yang/Iron Monkey, with Jean Wang as Miss Orchid, to the upstanding police chief, the devastating evil monk and all.Iron Monkey is essentially a film about the legendary Shaolin kung-fu master (also known as drunken master) Wong Fei-hung when he was young. In fact, the alternate title is Siunin Wong Fei-hung tsi titmalau, literally Young Wong Fei-hung's iron monkey. Follow this up with Jet Li's Once Upon A Time In China 2 (Wong Fei-hung ji yi Naam yi dong ji keung 1992, literally Wong Fei-hung #2 - young man should be self-sufficiently strong) and the adult Wong Fei-hung portrayal will be better understood why he's so good at his knowledge and practice of Chinese medicine, why he acted so restrained and coy with Aunt Yee, whom he very much loves but won't express so - all due to the austere teachings from his father as noted in Iron Monkey. We also learn that he lost his mother at a tender young age - though from Jackie Chan's The Legend of Drunken Master (2000 USA, Jui Kuen 2 1994, literally Drunken fist 2), we can see he has quite a wonderful stepmother - smart and wittily portrayed by Anita Mui! See it if you want another excitingly fun, martial arts action-packed drama about the adult Wong Fei-hung.

A Kung Fu Robin Hood fights corruption in officialdom whilst providing for the poor and needy.  Kung Fu skills go from fancy kicks and hand work, to wok skills, balancing on poles and beating up bullies with an umbrella.  Once the visiting doctor realises his mistake in wanting to defeat our hero, a dynamic team up results against the evil foes from Shaolin who misuse their art to the obligatory Kung Fu bad guys (and girls).  The characters are quite good, even the little kid didn't irritate me (good skills).  This movie has some padding, with the father-son routine.  It worked ok, adding some plot and human interest to the movie.  Even one of the corrupt officials (Master Fox) moves beyond 1D, though the Shaolin monk is truly the 1D bad guy.  Well done Tsui Hark.

The story involves a Robin Hood-esque martial artist named the Iron Monkey teaming up w/ Wong Kei Ying to battle government corruption. The movie itself is a prequel to the OUATIC series, and in many ways is better than most of the entries in it. Thematically, this film deals with friendship, greed, corruption, and family relationships.However, this is a martial arts movie. The fight scenes are choreographed by Yuen Woo Ping. He was nominated for the Best Choreography award and it's a shame he didn't win. Donnie Yen, Yu Rong Gwong, and the rest of the supporting cast show off a vast display of martial arts. My favourite fight is when Donnie Yen battles the evil monks and the nun. His footwork is simply awesome, one of the best kickers in the business. All leads up to an impressive finale, where Donnie Yen and Yu Rong Gwong battle their foe on the top of a forest of burning poles. It must be seen to believe.Excellent film. There's a story. There are themes and morals. And there's some of the greatest fights one will witness. A true classic.

This isn't so much a movie about a Chinese Robin Hood/Zorro figure, or a strict martial arts hero - it's a movie about a young boy and the people who influence who he will become. It's poignant in parts - such as when Fei Hong tries to grab his father's hand and is scolded for it - and hilarious in others - My kung-fu is pretty good! exclaims a surprised Fei Hong in one scene.While much of the movie is focused on the concerns of the adults around him, Fei Hong is also the audience's conduit to the subtle messages of the movie as a whole. It's not all about kick-ass fight scenes - that's just how they keep our attention. The world portrayed in IRON MONKEY admires intellect and wit as much as martial arts ability. Woven into the whole is a lesson in honor, the balance between discipline and recklessness, and the need for affection and love.Fans of CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON will love this movie because of one simple fact - the plot is linear, with short flashback sequences as needed, and despite its intricacy, it's not too involved. CTHD would be like riding in a Rolls-Royce beautiful to look at, enjoyable to drive; but IRON MONKEY is like a Porche, fast, sleek and dangerous. CTHD may be visually superior as far as cinematography goes - and in a lot of ways, it is - but IRON MONKEY moves along in ways that CTHD does not. Also look for Tsang Sze Man, who had the potential to be what Haley Joel Osment is here in America. Pity Man didn't do any more martial arts films. Film fans must see this movie; kung fu fans probably should see this movie. But if subtitles scare you (the dubbed version isn't quite as good) and guys in robes and braids are gay, keep away. Go rent DUMB AND DUMBER or something.

With Tarantino's name attached to the previews, I had this growing concern that Hollywood had gripped this film a bit too hard, thus squeezing out any remaining value or originality. I had heard of the stories of Harvey Scissorhands and his ability to really do a number on these Asian films that find their way into our cinemas. I have heard that if you ever really want to fully enjoy one of these films, do not touch those with the name Miramax stamped anywhere. With this in mind, I believe you can see where the hesitancy was coming from, but I need to be honest, this wasn't a horrible film. Using a pre-Wachowski brothers technique of wires instead of bullet-time effects, Iron Monkey quickly transformed from your average Shaolin film (if there is such a thing), to a very humorous, creative, and original film.For some strange reason this film caught my eye and never let go. The strong blend between action and comedy rivals that of most modern Hollywood big-budget features. The impeccable timing of the actors, the perfection of each of the dance-like fights, and its ability to transcend from one genre to another is what really gave this film a big boost in my eyes. While I was expecting a notorious film full of girth and power, I was not in any way expecting this prize-winning, genre-jumping, symposium of pleasure. Everything from the balloonish characters to the simple, yet structured, story pushed this film beyond others of similar nature. I cannot express how impressed that I was with Iron Monkey and how it helped bring the martial arts film back into American homes.Another element that I enjoyed immensely in this film was the mystic forces behind the characters. The different Shaolin techniques impressed me and helped give the characters a masked depth to them. Being relatively new to this genre, I am constantly impressed by the power, creativity, and ingenuity of the basic moves that Shaolin implies while in battle. In this film, it was the Buddha Palm that made me utter the infamous Keanu line, Whoa. While this film wasn't perfection in a nutshell, it was enjoyable to go back to some of these classics and see where our now-modern films are borrowing their style. It is good to see the strength and ability of someone fresh instead of Hollywood Jackie Chan in these roles. Asian cinema is one of the most impressive genres in film, and continually it proves that it can break old molds and stereotypes by revamping them while still paying homage to the originals. It is a genre, unlike Hollywood, that actually pays honest respect to the proceeding films that gave them this opportunity, and while Iron Monkey isn't Criterion-esquire, it does provide several hours of countless fun and mind-challenging action.Finally, you cannot talk about a film like this without mentioning the action. I grew up in a house that prided itself on the popularity of the action film, and while my tastes have changed considerably over the years, it is always a pleasure to revisit in my mind those childhood days. Now, when I go back to visit my family, I take films like Iron Monkey and Shaolin Soccer to bring a new style of action into the home. It continues to be an instant hit. This film was no different. From the quick hand and leg combat, to the creative use of nearly every random inanimate object around, to the different elements of nature that are brought in to bring more thrill to the table, this film had everything and kept the enjoyment level high. That says a lot for a little Asian film that found itself corrupted by America.Overall, I was very impressed with this film. With my growing infatuation with this genre of film, I cannot wait to get my hands on more. While I wish that Miramax would not try to take these films to the butcher's block, they still provide several hours of enjoyment and plenty of action. In intensity and insanity of the actors help create a world where you believe in the impossible kung-fu move and allow even more punches to follow. This was a great film that should be enjoyed with subtitles (never dubbing) and without the Tarantino introduction. Check it out, I do not think it will bring disappointment.Grade **** out of ***** "},{"Title":"One of the greatest martial arts movie ever !!","Date":"19 April 1999","Score":"7 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":"  Donnie Yen and Yuen-woo ping team up again to bring us one of the best kung fu movies ever.

It doesn't matter to me how elaborate the effects of the people and objects on screen if I am not part of the dance.This project is pretty exhilarating in that regard. It is not as thrilling as `Crouching Tiger' because that camera actually entered the fight at times. This camera is always an observer, never a participant. `Tiger' allowed us to personally enter the tradition where the fights aren't between the people in them, but between the masters that trained them, people who may be dead.Nonetheless, this one is definitely worth your time, especially if you can have a friend explain how it fits within legends, history and styles of martial `arts.' That's because of the sheer dimensionality of how we interact with the space. The camera does move in space, often in odd and interesting ways.My favorite part is near the beginning. A pile of paper documents (the history we are seeing?) is blown helter-skelter into three-d. The Doctor and his Orchid perform a dance in the air recovering them - in order, as if they are dancing gods writing history. If they are gods, we are metagods and our dance assembles them.

The Iron Monkey turns up to rob from the corrupt officials and business people and give to the poor and homeless. Iron Monkey is really Dr Yang hidden beneath a mask. Wong Kei-Ying is forced by blackmail to find this Iron Monkey and kill or capture him. Kei-Ying is also a very skillful master of Kung-Fu. This film features many battles between evil monks, a witch, a disfigured man and the most powerful of all, an evil type of Emperor with deadly hands, feet and head.

They relied on incredible martial arts and flashy moves, and achieved greatness in their simplicity.  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon captivated audiences with its involving and meaningful story line, while also backing it with aeronautic kung-fu.  Iron Monkey tries SO hard to mix these two movie styles, but falls short...way short.  Take the kung-fu by itself and you have a terrific movie.  Rongguang Yu has feet faster than any I have ever seen, which made for exciting battles.  However, even though the storylines of the old Wu-Tang/Shaolin movies weren't rock solid, the dialogue was intense!  Iron Monkey's dialogue was cheesy as best, and the plot of a pseudo-Robin Hood hero is lost after the first 20 minutes, from then on its just a free-for-all.

In what seemed like a `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' knock-off, this proves to be several years ahead of last year's immensely popular fantasy/martial arts film. This is a Robin Hood-style action flick that follows Dr. Yang, the town doctor by day and the `Iron Monkey' by night, who steals from the rich, corrupt government and gives their gold and food to the poor. A combination of Hung Gar (kung fu) and choreography makes for the most exciting and amazing action sequences seen on the silver screen in quite some time.Like a Jackie Chan movie, there are very funny moments within the action sequences, but like `Crouching Tiger', the fantasy feel of the film is very appealing. In fact, director Yuen Wo Ping was the martial arts choreographer for `The Matrix', if that gives you an indication of what the fight scenes are like. Every character in this movie is amazing at what they do. Especially impressive is 10-year-old Tsang Sze-man, who could put many fighters twice his age and size to shame. While most martial arts movies are poorly translated and tend to make the movie funny, this one does it on purpose. Some of the lines are so offbeat, that they were obviously put there for a laugh.This is a perfectly good escapist action film that, while not completely original, is fun to watch and very well made. Surprisingly, this is quite possibly the best action film of the year. If you liked `The Matrix' and `Crouching Tiger', go see this in the theater.

A hero, maybe noble, maybe not, wanders into a troubled land, good and evil clash, great rivalries are settled, but only after a great many extras get smacked around to sound effects that resemble someone taking a blackjack to the produce section. If that's all we expect, we are rarely disappointed.  So it's just icing on the cake when, in addition to the kung-fu smackdown, we get a story that makes sense, characters that compel, and a director who lavishes attention on each scene, even when someone ISN'T getting their f****y kicked.  That's why Iron Monkey (for simplicity's sake, I'm just going to use the Westernized title; purists can go get stuffed) is such a welcome treat. After the stunning success last year of Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, perhaps it was realized at last that American megaplexites might finally be able to appreciate a kung-fu movie done as quality  cinema. Woo Ping Yulen, who made his mark in Hollywood as a fight choreographer, is the main guy on this one, and it is apparent that while he certainly knows how to run a fight, he also can direct a movie as well.  Too often, when stunt or special-effects gurus take to directing, they run out of patience during scenes that don't reflect their speciality, but Woo Ping is not one of these.  Some of the best moments in this movie take place when no one is fighting at all particularly memorable is a scene in which a couple of Shaolin super-pugilists cook dinner. Not to say the action scenes aren't up to snuff; they are.  The energy never flags, even during extended melees, and while the brawls often involve the same elements, you never feel as though they are repetitive.  The fighting is bone-crunching hard and dirty too.  The combatants in Crouching Tiger soared through the air like graceful birds, whizzing and turning in artful patterns as they pursued one another across rooftops, but the fighters in Iron Monkey collide, crash, and mix it up, re-assembling their shattered hands and bleeding more than a little bit.  Rarely a moment goes by when someone isn't hurtling through a splintering bamboo wall.  Woo Ping also makes good use of my personal favorite kung-fu convention the hero, just  having laid waste to four or five malefactors in rapid succession, lands back to earth, often atop a table, coiling like a snake, with just the hint of a smirk, before the battle is rejoined. The story is simple and familiar an itinerant monk/physician/five-fingers-of-death  type wanders into a satellite Chinese province ruled by brutal, corrupt officials (hmm, some things haven't changed much), who are bedeviled by the mysterious Iron Monkey, a masked vigilante who rips off the overlords and distributes gold nuggets to the poor and desperate.  The newly arrived wanderer, who devastates bands of ruffians with only an umbrella, is strong-armed by the corrupt governor into hunting down Iron Monkey, lest his young son be killed.  But the script is good, the dialogue and translation make sense (it is also subtitled, which helps a lot), and the actors give such life to the characters, you'd swear you haven't seen their ilk in every other kung-fu movie ever made.  The stars, Rongguang Yu as Iron Monkey, and Donnie Yen as the archetypical good man forced to do wrong, display the type of solemn magnetism that raises stuff like this above the ordinary.  Also memorable are Jean Wang as the lovely but formidable Miss Orchid, and Shun-Yee Yuen as Chief Fox, a sort of Ching Dynasty version of Claude Rains in Casablanca. Many people may dismiss this movie as a second-rate import clunker riding the coattails of Crouching Tiger, and it would be a shame to do so.  While it certainly lacks Tiger's epic sweep, it is also less determined to be philosophically inscrutable, for which I think I liked it a little more.  In any event, Iron Monkey at least softens the blow caused by the postponing of Windtalkers.  As the saying goes, if this is the sort of thing you like, you'll really, really like this.

He is in top form, creating one of his better films, alongside the action of Drunken Master 1&2, Fist of Legend, Tai Chi Master, Last Hero in China, and Wing Chun.The Iron Monkey is one part Robin Hood, one part Batman, and all kick butt Chinese folk hero, hiding under the guise of a kind doctor by day. The oppressive and corrupt local government wants his stealing from the rich and redistributing the wealth to end. In a haphazard way, Donnie Yen arrives with his son (The legendary Wong Fei Hung of Drunken Master fame. Here, portrayed as a youth, by a girl. Shes good, not quite as good as the little kid from New Legend of Shaolin, but good)and is duped into catching the elusive Iron Monkey, witch of course never happens, because the two forces of good, Yen and Monkey, end up forming an alliance. Good thing too, because soon they both have to deal with a renegade group of former Shaolin monks, who have an interesting array of facial scars and demonstrate such techniques as the Virgin Sword and Wonder Palm (aka. Poison Palm). Of course, in the world of kung fu, good claims the victory.Iron Monkey boasts all the elaborate fight sequences one comes to expect from Woo-Ping, and he does not disappoint. His use of wirework and tricky, outlandish choreography rarely looks clumsy and is smooth and impressive, particularly when Iron Monkey is fighting. The movie moves well, never drags, and a few of the humorous gags provide a good chuckle or two without, as Woo-Ping can sometimes do, stretching the humor for too long. Highly Recommended.

The action is spread out at the beginning but as time presses on it becomes non-stop and it is all good. Now I must say one thing.....Some of the fights kind of get monotonous. Let me say this the repetitive nature of 2 things (kicking objects back and forth at each other and throwing stuff and kicking it before it hits them) would have DOOMED any other film but not Iron Monkey the repetitive moves are not a negative thing since it is still cool and they do kick and throw different objects each time.

If so the issues faced are quite convincing and may hold a place in the annals of Chinese history and literature. The history goes back to mid 1850's when the rich kept getting richer and the poor were become more deprived of any financial gain. To me it the story has a Asian equivalent to the greatest English character in ancient folklore, Robin Hood. The time period was different, but the motives between Robin Hood and Iron Monkey are very similar as both rebels try to outsmart a corrupt government by committing criminal acts for a good cause.In a rather poor slum in China, refugees in the area are being overruled by corrupt governor (James Wong). An incognito hero donning a mask who only goes by the name Iron Monkey (Rongguang Yu) is willing to overthrow this Governor by robbing from him and all the other rich people to give to the impoverished villagers. Governor Cheng lines up possible suspects who may be this mysterious anti-hero. In the middle of this conundrum include a monk Wong Kei-Ying (Donnie Yen) and his young son Wong Fei-Hung (Sze-Man Tsang). Cheng demands Wong to search for Iron Monkey while he holds his young son hostage. Through trials and tribulations, father and son lead themselves to the abode of Dr. Yang (Rongguang Yu) and his assistant Nurse Orchid (Jean Wang). It's quite clear that Dr. Yang is indeed Iron Monkey. This clearly pointed out once the character is introduced.The story is simple and easy to follow through. However it skips through scenes at times which makes the movie feel a bit awkward at times. One minute there's bickering if or if not Fei-Hung may have a roast duck and segues to Dr. Yang and Kei-Ying joining forces to bring down Shaolin Monk Hiu Hing (Shi Kwan Yen) We're familiar with this character and lengths he went through so there's nothing new to inform us about here.Sure the story might be thin and there's a lot of fighting, but that's what you expect to see in an action film. Aside from that the plot of the story actually stands out pretty well. The legend of Iron Monkey has been mentioned in many stories and folklore as he fights corruptions from the Governor who's trying to gather enough money to support his nine wives. The corrupt Monk does unorthodox tricks up his sleeves (literally) that can break through anything. You wonder if these individuals are insured. Like in superhero and police dramas, there will be a lot of property damage and it affects innocent bystanders. One provocation and we all suffer. In a rare occurrence one bystander gets some restitution while the antagonists get what's given to them. The refugees won't expect much left after watching stuff getting destroyed.To me, I felt a little bit of Jackie Chan and Jet Li folded into one package. On the visual format, it's vintage Li. But action wise it has a Jackie Chan flare to it. Sure there's wirework involved and Chan (with the exception of the crappy The Medallion) refrains from using cheap wirework to his advantage. The set pieces at the end will really set your souls on fire. Knowing that this is a fictional period piece film, that's classic Jet Li. The little girl in the film was adorable, but I'll just stay out of her way when it comes to battle. Let her have her duck.

It's a retelling of the Wong Fei Hung story with a twist this time around, Fei Hung is a child who plays a supporting role to the central thrust of the storyline which is about a Robin Hood-style freedom fighter battling corrupt politicians.The great thing about IRON MONKEY is the action, of which there is plenty. It's ably directed by Yuen Woo Ping and, put simply, it kicks ass &#x96; despite the plentiful wirework. Donnie Yen is a past master at this kind of material and delivers an action-oriented performance that never lets you down, while the real surprise is Rongguang Yu, a very familiar face in Hong Kong cinema who proves his worth in the kung fu stakes.The narrative is fast-paced and fuelled with conflict and action and the whole film has a colourful, old-fashioned vibe that keeps it moving merrily along.

Well laid out (in the fashion of ROBIN HOOD or ZORRO or THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL, et al), with some beautiful cinematography and special effects, IRON MONKEY nonetheless falters when it comes to its very reason for being- the martial arts sequences themselves. Reality never rears its ugly head (it rarely even comes close) the mechanically-enhanced martial arts mayhem blatantly defies the laws of physics to an astonishing degree. This undermines the solid all-around performances by the actors. The final battle, for instance, reminded me of the lyrics from a song They swing through the air with the greatest of ease- those daring young men on the flying trapeze. Instead of a realistic, nail-biting hand-to-hand battle, we end up with cgi-enhanced acrobatics. Again.

It tells of the mysterious fighter of corruption and helper of the poor, Iron Monkey, using his awesome martial arts abilities to take from the greedy rich and help out those in trouble. As the authorities grow more zealous and oppressive in their hunt for him the travelling Wong Kei Ying and his son Wong Fei Hung become involved, as Kei Ying pledges to catch Iron Monkey, thinking the authorities are in the right on the issue. Of course, the general developments of things are easily guessable, but what really gives this one its fabulous entertainment value is the frequent jaw-dropping fighting, not quite non stop but still deployed in quite a wild stream, enough to sate even the hungriest of action fans. Director/choreographer Yuen Woo Ping goes heavy on the wire-work, adding delightful impact to the many blows but also constructing elaborate and thrilling displays of fantastical acrobatic prowess, not just flying but all kinds of spinning and leaping shenanigans. Wrought with intricacy and sometimes interwoven with more traditional and ground based fighting to create an ever surprising and breakneck paced spectacle, the action scenes in this one are really quite terrific. The stars of the film all do pretty great jobs, Rongguang Yu is decently heroic and chivalrous as Iron Monkey, whilst Donnie Yen comes off nicely noble as Wong Kei-Ying. The beautiful Jean Wang lights the screen as Iron Monkeys lady companion, whilst Tsang Sze Man is lively and amusing as the young Wong Fei Hung. Good villainy is provided by Fai Li, Yee Kwan Yang and others countering the derring do of the heroes with suitably cunning and mean displays. The film really is splendidly entertaining, it loses out just a little though in not providing more regular martial arts amongst the wire-work. The stars are all so talented that it would have been really nice to see more regular work, perhaps a few simple traditional fights without even any undercranking would have lifted this one to perfection. The abundance of wire-work also slightly reduces the dramatic impact of the film, as the viewer quickly loses a sense of realism and the chances for real connection with the characters as people rather than just roles in a stock plot line are a little slim. There is also, as with many of these films thematic interest in the plot line that is somewhat subsumed by all the fighting. Still, these are just minor complaints in what is, for the most part tremendous entertainment. Anyone who likes Hong Kong action and has a taste for wild wire-worked shenanigans should check this one out pronto, it really is an absolute ripsnorter.

And it's not just Donnie Yen - the kid who plays the young Wong Fei-Hung, Miss Orchid, and the Iron Monkey are all fantastic and really showcase the beauty of the art form known as kung fu.My only real complaint is that with Donnie Yen's skill, they didn't need to speed up some of the fight scenes the way they did.Also really interesting is the importance that food plays throughout the whole movie - rice, steamed buns, stewed mutton, peking duck... I wonder if this as some special significance in the Wong Fei-Hung stories?? Humour is sprinkled throughout which adds to the entertainment. There are some really great one-liners that are probably more elegant in Cantonese, but in English they are hokey and I love it... for example You will die soon as you have been hit by my King Kong Fist!, and You, failure! Come try that again!. You gotta love it!! My only warning is that if you aren't a martial arts film fan and are expecting Crouching Tiger, you will probably be disappointed.

Oppression, hero spawned from both that and the fact that his father was murdered by a sect of shaolin monks. In some ways, its a supped up set in china Batman, but with more of a Robin Hood flavour to him. So, the govener of the province is trying to catch the hero at all costs, so he rounds up any suspicious characters around town, including a new arrival and his son.

It's one of the first martialarts films to use elements of eastern and western culture.For example, the music has been redone with a James Venable score. Even Quentin Tarantino was overlooking the movie before it was released.The story is set in China 1858, when corrupt officialstook advantage of poor refugees. In the city of Chekian, a greedy and low life governor namedChen (James Wong)is stealing food supplies and spends mostof his time having sex with 9 wives!!! Yes nine wives!!!Well the people of Chekia are sick of this jerk and theywant someone to take him out. That's where the Iron Monkey (Yu Rong-Guang) comes in.He is a just a master at martial arts and his appearence in black cast a fear over his enemies. In fact at one point in the movie, he shaves of the governor's eyebrows (talk about a close shave). The security chief (Yuen Shun-Yi) tries to captures theIron Monkey but can't. What I loved about the movie, besides the breathtaking action scenes is the story itself revolving corruption and the need for a hero to rid the city of evil and bad individuals.Also I loved the fact that Iron Monkey has a secret identitylike Spiderman and Superman. No one suspects his real identity which is that of a herbalist. However, the movie further gets intriguing as another herbalist comes into town with his son. The evil governorkidnaps the herbalist's son and won't release him until someone captures the Iron Monkey. To complicate matters, an evil monk comes into the picturesand plans to take the Iron Monkey out. One other thing I loved about the movie, is the arsenalof moves every fighting character has.

Definitely better without all the overdone computer special effects.  This proves that Jackie Chan isn't the only martial artist who injects humour into his fighting scenes.

CTHD was amazing, but its rather mundane plot was stretched out and drawn out so much that much of the energy was lost, leaving a movie tending to wallow in its own pretentiousness.  Iron Monkey, however, doesn't know the meaning of the word pretentious.  It does know the meaning of kung-fu.That kung fu has a long line of greatness and cheeziness before it in many Hong Kong actioners, one that Iron Monkey stands proudly with.  Yes, the action is amazing, but more what caught me off guard is the humor, like the 'cleansing the palate' scene...it's all built up perfectly.  Its robin-hood-esqe storyline is pared down to the basics, but still comes across clearly and somewhat freshly.Anyhoo, it all comes down to the kung fu.  If you watch it for the plot alone you may be disappointed, but as a whole it's one of the best I've ever seen.

For the most part it seems like a very formula martial arts picture, but it's use of choreography and more importantly its humour separates it from being just an ordinary chop-socky.I saw this in a packed house on Friday and all I can say is this movie is 100% fun and enjoyment.  Everyone got into it massively, whooping and hollering.  Some people couldn't even sit still trying to contain their enjoyment!  Like most martial arts films you know that the story only suits to create fight scenes which you highly anticipate (and done brilliantly might I add).  But what separates it more is the constant gags and humour used in the film.  The corrupt governor is a bufoon, at one point he orders his henchmen to arrest everyone and anyone who might be the iron monkey.  This creates some hillarious scenes such as when a group arrest an old man who sneezes proclaiming 'You Sneeze like a monkey!! you're coming with us!'.  The real hero though is a doctor who keeps a low profile with a female assistant that he rescued from some corrupt pimps.  We even see them after they close the clinic, going into their second identity fliying and jumping around to chase papers blown in the air.  It's like seeing Batman and Robin transform in the batcave.And like any martial arts film, there is no large amount of profanity, no sex, it's comic book violence and you know who the badguys are.  The main boss villan has one of the best on screen intro appearances I have seen in a long time. For the most part the acting is so over the top in that martial arts B movie dialogue, 'Shadow Kick,  Your kick is no match for my poison buddha palm, Your corrupt sect destroyed my father! etc.. etc..  but you love it none the less and it really gets good when the insults start flying during the fight scenes Ah YOU the ugly virgin again  WHAP WHAP SMACK!!!  The actors in this film you can tell are having so much fun.Much has been said about the astonishing use of the final fight scene involving 3 people jostling over a flaming pit on wodden poles.  While spectacular the idea is, I honestly found it sometimes hard to follow and even some of the fight scenes have that over the top hyperkinetic feel to them where it seems like overkill.  Certain scenes are definatly sped up, and people are twisting in mid air, balancing themselves on cloth, implausable?  of course, but this movie is all a fantasy.  Perhaps my jadedness is getting tired of all the matrix-wire pulling fight scenes, but for the most part this movie is an absolute joy!  It was one of the rare times in the theatre people were yelling, laughing HARD, and applauding and cheering when the villan was killed.  That is what going to the movies is all about and make sure you see this in a packed house.This should have been the movie for the summer, and this IS one of the greatest martial arts movies every made.Martial arts rating 10 out of 10Overall Rating 8 out of 10  "},{"Title":"A Kung-Fu Joy Ride!","Date":"11 October 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":"  It definitely takes a little bit of 'orientation' when watching a Hong Kong Flick. The characters can be a bit cartooney, the performances are over the top, and the stories, well... a bit foreign. But once you get past this, you'll be hard pressed to find films with more breath-taking action and excitement. One of the crown jewels of Hong Kong Action Films is Iron Monkey, directed by Woo-ping Yuen, who also did all the action choreography for The Matrix.Originally released in 1993, Buena Vista has gone back and completely restored Iron Monkey with fantastic results. The print of the re-release has deep rich colors and very little imperfections (only a few shots look as if the color timing is a little off). In addition to restoring the picture, they've refined the audio including an update to the score. The end result is an Iron Monkey which is on par with current Hollywood theatrical releases. Before seeing Iron Monkey I read a lot of concern from DVD Talk Members in The DVD Talk Forum about the re-release being dubbed. I'm happy to report that it ISN'T dubbed! Iron Monkey is presented in its original Cantonese audio with really excellent new subtitles.But the reason to see Iron Monkey isn't for its great picture and sound. Iron Monkey has some of the best martial arts action you'll see on film. If you liked the action and swordplay of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon or enjoy the action of stars like Jackie Chan or Jet Li, do yourself a favor and see Iron Monkey.

All I know is this Iron Monkey made me laugh. Not a There's Something about Mary kind of laugh--those laughs that are sometimes uncomfortable (both because you laughed so hard, and because the scenes were so vile that you had a hard time stomaching it). The kind of laughs that Iron Monkey provokes start as a seedling idea, and spread from the brain to pull at the corners of the mouth. At some point, the laughs are no longer recognized as individual, but rather a collection of pure enjoyment as you wait for the next trap, the next slap, the next vase in the face.Let's begin with the director (since he is the one part of the movie that most of us have experience with). By now, Woo-Ping Yuen is legendary, and you might even have one of his movies in your collection. He began his career as an actor in the 1960's, and moved on to director and fight choreography. He has become most famous for the latter. In the last 10 years, Yuen made a name for himself in America by choreographing the fight sequences in The Matrix trilogy, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, and most recently Kill Bill (Vol. 1&2). If you liked any of those fights, with high flying effects and lots of quick reflexes, you'll be sure to enjoy this one.What about the plot? It's really quite straight forward. A doctor (Rongguang Yu) doubles as a Robin Hood known as Iron Monkey, taking money from corrupt Chinese leaders and re-distributing it to the peasants. He catches the attentions of high ranking Governor Cheng, who wishes to catch and kill the good doctor. When young Wong Fei-Hung is captured by the governor, his father (Donnie Yen) must track down Iron Monkey in order to have the boy released. It is up to Iron Monkey, his assistant Miss Orchid, and the boy's father to save the child from certain doom. In the process they must teach the governor a very valuable lesson about abusing power.And then there is the fighting. Because the filmmaker is a martial arts choreographer, the fights are phenomenal. There are some pretty impressive scenes involving staffs, swords, umbrellas, benches, and very sharp tacks. One of the more exciting scenes occurs when a pile of papers is blown from a table and Iron Monkey and Miss Orchid must retrieve the papers from midair. The dance that follows is a truly beautiful piece of camera-work.Though there has been discussion that the story was changed for the American release of the film (presented by Quentin Tarantino), it really doesn't make much of a difference. People in the know will talk about the historical significance of the characters, the edits made by Miramax in the American release, and the improper translation from Cantonese to English. But really, who cares? Since most people in these parts probably couldn't tell the difference between Mandarin, Cantonese, Shiatsu, Hibachi, Mitsubishi, or Moo Shoo Pork, I'm not going to pretend like it matters that some dialogue has been cut or mistranslated. If you've never seen the original edit, then you won't even notice these differences. The movie rings in at around 90 minutes, and assumedly most of the edits were made to hit that valuable cut-off time.Make no mistake; the fights are where this film shines. But Iron Monkey is as much about family values, government corruption, and the indomitable human spirit (*sigh&#133;a tear) as it is about a swift kicks to the midsection and beautiful camera work. I would go so far as to say it is a family film, aimed at anyone who wants to recapture the enjoyment that can be found in the great fantasy films of America (Star Wars, LOTR, Dunston Checks In). At the very least, you can sit back and laugh at the crazy dialogue and surprised looks on the character's faces as they get hit with random objects.

This movie is amazing. Probably the best thing about Iron Monkey is that it doesn't try to disguise itself as something it isn't, like some of the recent Chinese movies that have entered American theaters. It isn't a suspense thriller, which is why it gets the Iron Monkey's identity (Dr. Yang) out of the way early, which keeps the plot moving.The movie is all about the action, and it has some of the most amazing fight scenes you will ever see. Yuen Woo-Ping, six years before he became famous with his groundbreaking special effects in The Matrix, does a mastery of kung-fu fighting here. The final battle, where the two protagonists go up against the evil Hin-Hung will leave you breathless, and it is still amazing for me five times after I saw it the first time.That said, the plot is good enough, and considering that about half of the movie is people fighting, it tells a pretty good story about how young Wong Fei-Hong, a Chinese hero as an adult, got inspired by his father and the Iron Monkey defeating the evil Royal Minister Hin-Hung and making the city less corrupt.Not really as popular as Crouching Tiger, Hero, or House of Flying Daggers, which is a shame because it's twice as good as Tiger, 10 times as good as Hero, and 100 times better than the pathetic House.

Like Batman, he has a dual identity, battling evil and corruption at night while masquerading as a law-abiding citizen by day, he has a bag full of gimmicks, and he has a sidekick.In this episode/movie of the exciting adventures of the eastern Dark Knight and Miss Orchid, the Girl Wonder, corrupted town governor Cheng, the &#145;Sheriff of Nottingham', with his assistant Chief Fox, a homage to Chief O'Hara, called upon a visiting pugilist warrior and his much-more-famous partner/son (think Green Hornet and Kato) to capture the Dark Knight. Just when the home hero and his visiting counterpart are about to clash in grand spectacle, they joined forces against an evil threat in the form of a renegade Shaolin monk.It does not take a genius to realize that this is no `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon', and the differences do not stop with the action scenes. While `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is a magnificent work in many respects, `Iron Monkey' is not. Aside from the action scenes, there is nothing of substance about the film. Direction and cinematography are lackluster. The storyline is grossly thin, as well as far-fetched and unbelivable. It is unrealistic to think that a pre-teen kid can not only fight but also be able to beat up adults single-handedly; or a villainous monk ascending to a government position despite his checkered past and current ignoble accomplishments, without any opposition whatsoever. Adding to the negatives is bad dubbing. The characters are often heard speaking without moving their lips. Horrible editing of sound and picture only makes matters worse.Yet the only gold mine of this movie, which makes it entertaining despite its many flaws, is the action sequences. They are abundant in quality and quantity. This undoubtedly establishes the standard in which all martial arts films will be judged, which American martial arts action flicks should follow but do not. American martial arts films rely on machismo and natural charisma of the actors to carry the film, an approach that often dies of boredom especially since their fight scenes are frequently one-sided. Chinese martial arts films have breathtaking fight choreographies that emphasize on creativity and improvisation, so even if the same style is utilized the approach makes it look fresh and original. Besides the actors' expressing themselves beautifully in their own unique martial arts background, their repertoire of weapons include ladders, umbrellas, chains, metal balls, wooden benches and &#133; flaming bamboo poles (you have to see it to believe it!). Not only do all of the main characters participated in the fighting, they were also defined by their own styles on-screen Iron Monkey being acrobatically-inclined; the Girl Wonder dancing her movements like a ballerina; &#145;Green Hornet' excessive use of his legs including drawing an arc with the tip of his toes as a pre-fight stance; &#145;Kato's cockiness and use of bamboo pole; and the Villain being hands and claws for the most part.One can fault an action film for its lack of everything else, but `Iron Monkey' does put films of van Damme and Rothrock's to shame, or to the level of slow-motion tai-ji, or better yet to oblivion. Definitely enjoyable, even if its only for the fight sequences.Spellcaster's Level 6 "},{"Title":"great martial arts, poor dialogue","Date":"23 October 2001","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":"  Perhaps in its native language this film doesn't have lines as silly and hokey, but you can't use that excuse for some of the foolishness of the plot.

Its story line is simple, yet effective, providing humor, fun and suspense all at once, which is not atypical of movies from Hong Kong.  It cannot be compared to Crouching Tiger since the directing is so different and the martial arts has progressed quite a bit.Some people thinks the martial art is over the top, but there are so many disciplines of martial art, including some that emphasize their ability to be light on their feet.  Whether they could perform such acts, I cannot answer, but many of those incredible stuff they did have roots in Kung Fu.Anyway, it is still a fun film.

The plot was reminiscent of Zorro or Robin Hood, that is, the good guy steals from the rich and powerful and gives to the poor.  As is usual for these movies the plot was almost childish and silly in places and interspersed with scenes of violence.  You must understand what type of movie you're getting involved in when you see it or you'll be disappointed.  It was fun and paced well and as deep as a dew.  Good mindless entertainment.

Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, a fairy tale resonating with poetry, mysticism, and poignance, captures natural settings with glorious cinematography and shows us martial arts sequences that defy gravity and other laws of physics. Iron Monkey has the martial arts.In Iron Monkey, a doctor in a town plagued by poverty disguises himself with all the believable effectiveness of Clark Kent to rob the corrupt governor by night as Iron Monkey and maintain a clinic by day as Dr. Yang.  Iron Monkey easily evades the authorities until the governor forces a skilled fighter, Wong Kei-Ying, to hunt Iron Monkey to ensure his son's release from prison.  Soon, though, Dr. Yang effects the boy's release and Iron Monkey and Wong Kei-Ying are fighting side-by-side to rescue the town from the reign of the corrupt governor and an even more corrupt Shaolin monk gone bad.None of this really matters, though.  The story is formulaic and the characters are stock.  The meat of the movie is its action.  The fight scenes are masterfully-choreographed and inventive, polished and stylized. If you like well-done martial arts sequences for their own sake, the fights in this film are enough reason to see it.  If you require a meaningful story and well-drawn characters, too, stay away.

The version is hysterical goofy dialogue, goofier sound effects, and great over-the-top fight choreography. Now Quentin Tarantino and Miramax Films has re-translated, re-scored, subtitled, and released Iron Monkey into American theatres. The goofy dubbed dialogue has been replaced with historical references and righteous hero-speak. The sound effects are entirely gone. BUT the fight choreography remains fanciful, creative and the ultimate example of silly wire-fu. Knowledge of the plot is completely unnecessary. It's basically good outlaw, bad governor, noble traveler, a wise beautiful woman and a well meaning but spineless lawman battle each other. Add a sprinkling of greedy wives, brothel owners, poor people, and corrupt monks, and you have the story.The added prologue and subtitles make the story easier to follow, but the fighting and humor is really the point of this movie. Sometimes the serious subtitles seem at odds with the crazy fight choreography. This is not a realistic martial arts movie. Not only do the characters fly through the air and defy gravity while fighting, one character attacks his enemies with a giant flying sleeve. Silly stuff, but the Tarantino and Miramax version seems to be fighting the silly side of the film. They also tack an American-style happy ending onto the film. At the close of the movie, printed titles let us know that Iron Monkey (Yu Rongguang) and Orchid (Jean Wang) get married rather than just continuing to live together in admiration and sexual repression for the rest of their lives. I don't really know which version is more true to the original spirit of the movie. The version in theatres right now is highly enjoyable and probably preferable for those who like wire-fu but aren't crazy about cheese. For those of you who appreciate campy humor, rent the Golden Harvest version; it's much funnier even if it is of slightly poorer quality.

The story, a typical Robin Hood type one that isn't needed to be expanded on here, is really a base-line for a number of well stage fight scenes (the best with poles above fire).  The performances are decent and I suppose people that are really hardcore in the genre will be delighted.  However, I have my squables with the film I want to get off my chest.I'm not sure if everyone will agree with me on this notion, but I'm not sure if the direction martial arts movies seem to be taking is the greatest thing since CGI came about.  Am I the only guy who enjoys classic Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan films where the guys fight without jumping on roofs and hopping like Ninja Turtles, without fighting at a speed a bullet wouldn't catch up with, and without having to divert your attention from the action because of subtitles (say what you will about dubbing, but it is effective in these movies in the most part)?  I'm not saying that the new type of stylizing (shown here in Iron Monkey and also in last years smash Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) is a really bad thing, a good amount of the time the martial arts scenes are exciting and cool.  But it might be prudent to not forget the originality and awesomeness that came with people like Lee and Chan and go forever into the abyss of visual effects and subtitles.That being said, I definately didn't mind seeing Iron Monkey in giving some decently entertaining 90 minutes of film, but just remember for those entering not familiar to proceed with some form of caution (maybe in knowing Chinese maybe).

They are packed for pure enjoyment and films by Jet Li and Jackie Chan leave you with your jaw on the floor.  My favorite would be Once Upon A Time In China.As for Iron Monkey.  I have to disagree with the majority.  Yes, there are lots of action scenes.  Yes, it does relate to the Once Upon A Time In China series.  Yes, there are some good martial arts scenes in this.  But the over use of wires takes away from the full merit that this film could of had.  I liked a lot of the fighters in this picture but every one of them would fly through the air doing god knows what.  I am aware that just about every Jet Li film has wires used in it and I wasn't pleased with the use of special effects in Romeo Must Die, but the amount of wires in this is completely absurd.  I do realize there is a thing called suspension of disbelief but when it comes to this I just can't help it.  And the flying sleaves to top it off made me wish this was an anime so not only did it have an excuse, but only then would it look good.A large disappointment for me.

You can imagine, my imagination was brimming over at the utter expectation for a film with a plot that surrounded the epic tales of some sort of Iron corrugated monkey. I can't say for certain, but when I sat down and witnessed the atrocity of mundane action scenes which numbed away any feeling of a plot, I felt as though I had been robbed of my human decency. There have been some other movies with the word monkey in them, and they had nothing to do with monkeys. This is becoming an increasingly annoying tradition in Hollywood blockbusters and Foreign Films. There are of course some redeeming qualities, like the credits that closed the film, they were good. The visuals are abhorrently typical, something I could have witnessed while half-conscious without having missed a thing. The plot, there is no plot. I don't think it's so difficult to develop a plot; I don't understand why the writers of these scripts, if there are scripts, think that a ridiculous number of action scenes interrupted by boring dialogue makes for a good movie. The character development? Who are we kidding? In an action film of this caliber, the characters are more like paper cut outs, fashioned and molded to be of a specific make, lacking entirely any nuances of a real person. This whole film was a waste of my time, and it was a waste of my effort to keep my eyes open for the duration of the film. If they could just make a movie about a monkey with some sort of iron chasse capable of doing incredible things, it would have been more original and the monkey would probably have been a better actor than the idiots they gather for these martial arts films. I used to enjoy this genre. But now, it's become too commercial, and no one is chosen on the basis of any skill save their capability to kick really high. Would it be so much to ask for a film where Martial Arts action scenes are just the icing on the cake and not the majority of the movie? I guess it is...

However during the night he becomes the masked and mysterious Iron Monkey &#150; robbing from corrupt government officials and giving to the poor and oppressed. In a typical knee-jerk reaction, Governor Cheng arrests anyone associated with the word monkey, men who look like monkeys and, just to be sure, actual monkeys. Among those arrested is hero and martial arts expert Kei-Ying Wong and his young son Fei-Hung. To protect the innocents Kei-Ying fights Iron Monkey but the fight is broken up by Iron's escape. Seeing the potential, Cheng throws Fei-Hung in jail until Kei-Ying can capture Iron Monkey; Kei-Ying reluctantly accepts. On his quest he befriends Yang who helps him out &#150; unaware that he is the man he must capture. However when a Government Investigator arrives with a troupe of rebelling Shaolin monks things are only going to become more complex for both Yang and Kei-Wong.Having recently seen Western audiences go ga-ga for pretty martial arts without any humour or real emotional involvement, I felt it was time to go back and watch some films that are fun to watch &#150; hence me sitting back down to Iron Monkey. For fans of the first three 'Once Upon A Time in China' movies, Iron Monkey will be a great addition to the collection because it not only has similar action and humour but also features a young Fei-Hung in a supporting role. The film starts with a relatively simple Robin Hood style story and then adds Kei-Ying into the mix. At this point it starts to find it difficult to manage the material and we lose sight of Kei-Ying for quite a while, during which time the plot doesn't really advance. This is not a major criticism because, while it lingers it does still entertain however you can't help feeling that the material is not managing to keep its threads together. However it does pull it together (albeit in a rather hasty fashion) for the finale and it still works. The humour is never really laugh out loud funny but I found it consistently amusing in the acting, script and delivery.Of course the vast majority of the viewers will be here for the action and I'm pleased to confirm that it is all pretty great. The wire work looks natural (well &#150; as natural as it can look I suppose) and all the leading actors are actually good at what they are being asked to do. Of course many Western audiences asked about Woo-Ping will start quoting modern films at you but it is important to remember that, long before the American dollar took any interest, he was making this stuff look easy. Having a talented cast helps, although not all of them really cut the mustard in the actual acting front. Rongguang is an unknown quantity to me but he does OK in the lead role. At times he floats close to being a bit bland but generally he is behind a mask and it isn't really his fault. Yen is a great martial artist and he comes close to stealing the film and, if his character had been a bit warmer, he would have done. He has the screen presence but not the charisma of Jet Li and I always feel he is better at bad guys &#150; here his action is great but his performance is too harsh for my liking. Wang is very pretty and does the action very well but the best female role is actually from Sze-Man Tsang (albeit playing a boy). She is a nicely human character and she also is physically very impressive. The comedy is a big part of the film and as such it is important to note the work from Wong and, more specifically, Yuen's Master Fox (whose final line is very funny); they may be clowns but lets not forget that the clown is as important as the action hero in making a well-rounded film.Overall, with the rather ponderous Hero just leaving our cinemas, now is the time to look back at this film and others like it to remember why this genre is increasingly popular. Iron Monkey is a fun film, it is as simple as that &#150; the plot may not be the most moving and involving story ever told but it is entertainingly told. The action is great and will keep your eyes on the screen, while the constant tone of amusement helps to lighten the film and cover the lack of real human involvement in the characters. There are better films around but this did what I wanted it to do &#150; it entertained me on many levels.
