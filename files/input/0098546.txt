And the negative reviews were from insufferable snots.This movie made me laugh as a teenager, but it also makes me laugh as a fully grown adult. Does that mean the humor is dumb or sophomoric? Not necessarily. What exactly is adult humor anyway? Does it necessarily need to contain graphic depictions of sex and generous uses of profanity to be considered sophisticated and adult?? I contend that it does not, and I cite UHF as an example.The laughs here are genuine, and they come from lack of pretentiousness and an honest feeling that one need not take oneself too seriously at any given moment. Al lets us know that it's OK to make fun of yourself as well as the rest of society. Much of what he does is self-deprecating, and UHF is no exception. He doesn't stand around making fun of others and establishing an air of superiority over the rest of society. As George Newman, he becomes the everyman, infusing much of his own personality along with his on-stage comedic persona. And he's not afraid to kick himself around and then proceed to pull himself up via his own bootstraps. Nobody else has to be hurt.Plot has never been a big necessity in these spoof/parody movies. The Naked Gun, Airplane, Top Secret, Johnny Dangerously, and many others have had the most skeletal of plots. Cop must find and bring to justice bad guy who shot his friend. Burned out ex-pilot must save aircraft when crew dies. Rock and roll star must overthrow Nazi plot. Mobster must overcome those who wish to take him down. And in UHF we have Loser Man must save TV station from evil network exec. The plot is not important; it's just a vehicle to get us from laugh to laugh and set up the next joke.UHF's comedy, though basic, rings true, and if you'll drop all of your pretentious airs, you'll get it. (We all know you're not nearly as sophisticated as you think you are anyway.) Who among us can keep from laughing while Raul teaches poodles to fly? Who can stifle a chuckle when Stanley is doing... well... doing just about everything he does in this film? Al admits in his commentaries and interviews that UHF is no Citizen Kane. But that's the beauty of it. There's nothing complex here. It's all about the laugh, and there's where this movie really scores.

So many great scenes, so many awesome quotes, and best of all, a chance for Weird Al Yankovic to show off his talents, both as an actor and as a singer. Also, it's so much fun to see if you can pinpoint all the references to famous movies that Al puts into this film, such as the Raiders of the Lost Ark parody at the beginning, and many others.The film is the story of George Newman, a young man who has trouble holding a job (and frequently gets his best friend Bob in trouble too) due to his overactive imagination. When he is given ownership of a local TV station, UHF, his imagination can finally be put to good use, in inventing the most bizarre show lineup you can imagine. When a network owner gets jealous of UHF's success, George and his friends and fans must unite to stop him and keep UHF on the air. Michael Richards is also quite excellent as the optimistic, not-too-bright Stanley.Though it can be somewhat difficult to find, it's definitely worth the time and effort to buy UHF on DVD, so you can enjoy Weird Al's movie again and again and again...

He's actually more like Jim Varney''s Vern character that was so popular in the '80s a lame but super nice guy.That's what Weird Al plays in here, a Mr. Nice Guy who prevails against forces of evil against him, in this case a TV station owner Kevin McCarthy, who plays a totally over-the-top villain.Yankovic will never win any Academy Awards for his acting but he suffices in this no-brainer comedy. Some of the bits are actually quite clever and some are a bit raunchy (hence the PG-13 rating) but there is almost no profanity in here. Michael Richards was funny as the stupid janitor.

Yup, I think it's safe to say that this movie has everything, folks!Weird Al Yankovic's first (and only) movie is everything you would expect from this underappreciated comic genius.  It has the same goofy charm as a Weird Al record, and works as an effective visual representation of what Al's music is all about.  As you would expect, UHF contains plenty of movie parodies, all of which are spot-on and generally harmless.  Die-hard fans can also look forward to seeing a wide array of Al-isms like Twinkie-Wiener Sandwiches, detailed rants about bizarre nonsense, usage of the word weasel, et cetera.Casual viewers will find the good (U-62) vs. evil (Channel 8) story a bit ho-hum and the humor a little too...  Well, a little too weird.  But let's face it this film wasn't made to tell a captivating love story or to inspire us with biting social commentary.  It's an excuse for using a new medium to show Al doing what Al does best being himself.  And, as all of us devoted fans can agree, we couldn't possibly ask for anything more!  LONG LIVE MR. YANKOVIC!

The overall impression of the film though that it is a 97 minute Weird Al video. If over an hour and a half long weird Al video is your idea of cinematic ecstasy then by all means buy this film. However, if you are looking for a smart comedy avoid this fill at all cost. Personally I like a good dumb comedy and that coupled with my nostalgia makes the purchase worthwhile.

At first glance a cliche ridden poke at 80's TV and film but on further examination it is an original and skillfully made satire that ranks as highly as anything Mel Brooks or Monty Python have ever released. It stars Weird Al Yankovic, the man responsible for Eat it the famous parody of Michael Jackson's Beat it and it is clear from the outset that he loves the things he makes fun of. The movie outline provided by IMDB is sufficient as regards the plot and I'm not about to blow it for you, but there are one or two things I need to draw your attention to. The film starts with a parody of the opening sequence of Raiders of the Lost Ark and the attention to detail is staggering. The scene in which Weird Al Attempts to steal the golden idol is a perfect ape to the original scene in Raiders right down to each stroke of an unshaven chin. It's clear that that this parody is not done to poke fun but instead to add comedy to a familiar and formulaic piece of action, and it is with this in mind that the rest of the movie connects with your head as much as it does with your funny bone. It's not just a series of parodies though. There is a well defined plot pitching hero against villain (enthusiastically played by Kevin McCarthy) and the story meanders perfectly between George Newman's (Weird Al's character)imagination and his reality giving the perfect platform for Weird Al to put in a terrific comedy performance. There is as much original material as there are references to other famous films (Blazing Saddles, Close Encounters and Rambo to name but a few..) and the whole thing adds up to a genuinely funny movie. If you've seen all Mel Brooks's films or you need a change from Monty Python and Jim Carrey doesn't quite do it for you, this film is a must.

Most of them are also big fans of this movie, and so I had it built up quite a bit before I finally saw it. Wow, what a disappointment.  The humor was sophomoric, the jokes were crude, and the ending was childish.  I never wanted to see it again.Fortunately, it played on cable at school, and so I ended up watching it during several long nights of homework.  Once I had lost sight of the glorious hopes of a quintessential work of comedy, I was able to see this movie for what it really was.  Particularly, it is Weird Al doing what he does best  spoofing pop culture and giving fractured takes on the simple things in life.  From his take on Indiana Jones (perhaps one of the truest, funniest parodies of another movie found in film, with the crowning irony of reaching for the Oscar that Al and this film could never win), to Stanley's love of his mop, this movie is full of the kind of parody of art and life that has been Al's trademark.  Only Al would use a twinkie as a hot dog bun. Only he could include the remorseless sketch about launching animals out of the window.Still, the movie also had its dull moments.  Most irritating of those was his dream/music video about the Beverly Hillbillies.  While the computer graphics were pretty good for a  low-budget film of its day, it was a pretty lame song to include.  That brings up another of my frustrations with the movie.  The soundtrack included The Biggest Ball of Twine in Minnesota, which is perhaps my all-time favorite song by Weird Al, but it was not found anywhere in the movie (I listened to the end of the credits for it).  The fact that I wasn't listening for it any more was probably a key reason why I could enjoy the movie the second time.  And, of course, it was entertaining to see such well-known performers as Michael Richards and Fran Dresher in this early role.After all else is said and done, Al Yankovic delivered a movie that was just good, clean fun.  You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll buy a spatula (Nothing says 'I love you' like the gift of a spatula).

Granted, not all of its jokes were terribly funny for this viewer, but there were some that worked quite well. In his inimitable style, 'Weird' Al sends up TV programming, music videos (naturally), movies, movie trailers, and commercials. The story (Al co-wrote with director Jay Levey, a frequent collaborator) relies on that comfortable old device of a misfit making good.Al plays George Newman, a fairly immature man who can't hold down a job because of his daydreaming and penchant for thinking up goofy ideas. Well, finally, as luck would have it, he finds an outlet for his creativity. His uncle Harvey (Stanley Brock) comes into possession of a nothing UHF TV station, and George is hired as a manager. Things get off to a rough start, but take off once George decides to put dim witted but well intentioned and lovable janitor Stanley Spadowski (Michael Richards) on the air.UHF does travel far on Als' likability and irreverent sense of humour. Among the programming that he devises are parodies of Phil Donahue like shows ('Talk Time') and game shows ('Wheel of Fish'). For this viewer, the brightest moments include the opening Raiders of the Lost Ark spoof, the Conan the Librarian sequence (Don't you know the Dewey decimal system?), and the extended mocking of Sylvester Stallones' Rambo movies (with Als' body makeup created by the guys at KNB).It also benefits from a strong villain, in this case Kevin McCarthy, who's perfect as nasty and domineering network affiliate boss R.J. Fletcher. The supporting cast features a rich variety of familiar faces in addition to those already mentioned Victoria Jackson as Als' fed-up girlfriend, soap opera veteran Anthony Geary in an interesting oddball part, and the late Trinidad Silva (to whom the movie is dedicated) as an unconventional wildlife program host, as well as Gedde Watanabe, Billy Barty, John Paragon, Fran Drescher, Sue Ane Langdon, and David Proval. Director Levey appears uncredited as Gandhi. One of the biggest laughs in UHF comes from comedian Emo Philips, as the unlikely shop teacher Joe Earley.Good fun overall, and guaranteed to send its fans away with smiles on their faces. As a bonus, Als' rocking theme song is pretty catchy.Seven out of 10.

But it proves once again that the masses are often wrong. I've read that it failed because there was too much competition at the box office at the time, and also because the critics disparaged it. Maybe that has to do with many critics looking down on comedy, that Weird Al was too closely associated with MTV at the time for them to give him a fair deal.UHF is a hugely enjoyable comedy. If you like Weird Al Yankovic or just the Saturday Night Life-type of lowbrow humor, then you've struck gold. I've seen classic comedies from the same era that were a helluva lot less funny. It's got a solid plot, lots of very funny scenes, and an amazing bevy of great actors (many of which were still relative unknowns then -- such as The Nanny Fran Drescher, Seinfeld's Kramer Michael Richards, or that guy from The Sopranos). Other actors didn't do too well later on in their careers but are still great here, I especially liked Al's girlfriend, Victoria Jackson).I appreciate that the makers really put some sweat into this and took it seriously, wanted to make a great comedy, rather than just a moneymaking vehicle for Weird Al (The kids seem to love this guy, so a movie with him should be a safe investment.)

Personally, pretty much anything he does makes me laugh so it came as no surprise that I enjoyed UHF. What was surprising was just how much I enjoyed it and how much I immediately wished that more people knew about it. It holds up as a hilarious comedy.The thin story sees Al playing George Newman, a daydreamer never in any one job for too long who's about to lose his girl. It looks like this could all change when an uncle gives him a small public TV station he won in a bet and, after a rocky start, the ratings start climbing higher and higher, thanks in no small part to a janitor named Stanley Spadowski (Michael Richards) who becomes a hit with audiences when he gets a chance to host his own TV show. There's a big, nasty, rival TV station (with the great Kevin McCarthy in charge) and a rush to make money during the last half hour but it's all really just an excuse for a load of great gags and fun parodies.This is not a movie to watch if you love nothing but classics of cinema. It's a movie to watch if you like 'Weird Al', enjoy seeing Michael Richards do his jittery, manchild act and can have fun with Indiana Jones parodies and adverts for Spatula City. There's also a gag here that may very well be the funniest dumb gag I have ever seen on screen, it had me crying with laughter for a good few minutes afterwards.Nobody in the cast is all that great (with the exception of Richards and McCarthy) but they all do what has to be done to move things along in between the moments of hilarity. Director Jay Levey does enough to keep things looking decent but, again, this is all really just about the gags and everything is done to serve the material, making it all work brilliantly.

And he also brought us the culinary advance of the Twinkie Wiener Sandwich (they are actually quite yummy!)Here's hoping for a re-release to video next year!

Not the best movie in the world, but as Al himself said in his Behind the Music, Critics cited the hackneyed plot, but it really wasn't about that, it was just an excuse to goof off. The plot's been seen before Everyman needs $75,000 in x amount of hours in order to keep heartless tycoon from buying out TV station. What makes the movie, though, are the Mad Magazine-esque movie parodies, the dark TV parodies (although some, such as Emo Philips sawing off his thumb, or Corpses 'R' Us, are not for all tastes), the oddball dialogue (What's the matter? Don't you like Bonanza?), the Dire Straits send-up, and the winning performances by Al Yankovic, Mike Richards, and the rest. An interesting sidenote is the before they were stars quality Michael Richards before he was Kramer, Fran Drescher before she was The Nanny, John Paragon before he was Jambi the Genie, and Philo (Anthony Gearey's role) was originally intended for a pre-MST3K Joel Hodgson. Say what you will about the movie, it's a cult film in every sense of the word, and it's one of my faves.

That being said, this is still a good movie.This movie starts off with one of many movie spoofs and turns into George Newman's ('Weird Al') daydream.  Soon after George and his friend, Bob (David Bowe), are fired from their jobs as burger flippers.  George's uncle wins a UHF station playing poker and agrees to let George become the station manager.  The station that George inherits is failing fast.George meets up with the station manager of a local network affiliate. R.J. Fletcher (Kevin McCarthy), is a hard-nosed station exec who enjoys yelling at those below him.  Fletcher dismisses George as something not to be bothered by.For a while George and Bob try to run the station and fail.  Bob figures that the station will be broke by the end of the week.  At the same time that Bob tells George this, George remember that he forgot his girlfriend's (Victoria Jackson) birthday.  George is dumped and hits rock bottom. During the taping of Uncle Nutsy's Clubhouse, George walks out and leaves the show in the hands of the janitor (Michael Richards).  George and Bob go to the bar and find out that people love Stanley Spadowski.George and Bob race back to the station and create many zany shows to put on the air.  These shows range from Wheel of Fish to Conan the Librarian. Eventually the station becomes number one in the market.Then George's Uncle Harvey racks up $75,000 in gambling debt and has to sell the station.  George offers to come up with the money so his station doesn't have to be sold.  The station holds a telethon and sells stock in itself.The acting in this movie is weak at best.  Al is definitely a better singer, but Michael Richards shows many of the traits that made him a star on Seinfeld.  The writing is hilarious, however the movie is choppy.  It seems like the movie is just a bunch of bits thrown together.Overall this movie is a classic.  I think that everyone should see it once, even if you don't like 'Weird Al.'

In this world of exhausted, uninspired Mad TV/SNL , it's hard to find good yucks these days (Whose Line Is It excepted). In everything he produces, Weird Al consistently hits the mark when he aims at our funny bone. I don't always care for every target or the way he shoots his arrow, but whether the result is a half-snort or a full belly laugh, the source is a form of art.It depends on how old you are In many ways, this film is a vehicle for the spoofs, which are spliced in. Most are pretty juvenile, and I have no qualms about hitting the 'fridge during them. The exception is the early MTV era Bev-er-ly-Hill-bill-ies version of the I-Want-my-M-TV music video.To each his own What engages me are the vibrant, goofy characters. Like The Princess Bride, the characters make the movie work. Like any good flick, UHF will transport you to a different world, where the bad guys get what they deserve and the Everyman (played by Weird Al) triumphs (with a little help from his/her friends). The favorite characters and  lines are certainly a personal thing. My daughter likes The Wheel of Fish guy, and the way he says You so stup-id!. For some reason, my favorite scene has the bad guys open the closet door marked Supplies and out jump the martial arts rescuers, whose cry of attack is meant to be Surprise!, but sounds exactly like Supplies! (There, I only ruined one visual joke, don't hate me.) I can't explain why it's so funny to me, it just is.The plot thins The content is schlock, but dang it, it's *good* schlock. I admit, my heart gets tugged when Stanley's beloved mop is wrenched from his arms. And maybe the real reason I rent the video, is to hear his pep talk about taking a toothbrush to the stubborn dirt spots in our lives.

That's not the only moment in this film worthy of that accolade.  UHF, starring and largely conceived by musical parodist Weird Al Yankovic, is the story of an American dream-owning our own low-powered TV station, and putting whatever the hell we want on it. Weird Al is an effective protagonist as George Newman, an unsuccessful, single male who along with his friend Bob, gets fired from darn near everywhere.  George is also having romantic problems with Teri (Victoria Jackson, direct from SNL), who wants him to get a real job.  George's uncle Harvey wins the deed to U-62 in a poker game, and instead of giving it up, his wife convinces him to let George run it.  Wackiness ensues.  The TV show parodies in this film are mostly hilarious, with sight gags courtesy of a midget cameraman and a big, coffee-guzzling tech guy.  But perhaps the greatest performance in this movie is by Michael Richards (yes, Kramer), as very inept janitor/kid's show host Stanley Spadowski.  Bumbling, mumbling, yet warm hearted, he's also really darn funny.  I swear you'll never think of oatmeal the same way again.  Yeah, the plot sucks, but if you're renting a film with Weird Al on the cover and expecting Pride and Prejudice, you have some major problems.

The physical comedy that he brings to his clueless character, Stanley Spadowski, is a type of premonition of his future Cosmo Kramer character. Richards does a great job in his portrayal of Spadowski as a dumbfounded janitor who's goal in life is reacquiring his mop! There are some other great performances by Victoria Jackson of SNL and Fran Drescher (in a role prior to her getting her big break in TV).The movie's story is a great lead into the Yankovic's various comedic skits. Commercials and shows such as Conan the Librarian, Spatula City, Town Talk - with Lesbian Nazi Hookers, Wheel of Fish, and Uncle Nutzy's Clubhouse. Yankovic's dream sequences of Rambo and Raider's of the Lost Arc are nicely done as well! This was truly one of my favorite movies growing up and to this day, I will still watch if it is on TV.

As they come up with wacky TV shows their station grows in popularity, a thing that does not sit well with the TV mogul of another TV station. And with the threat of being bought out, George has to raise a lot of money in order to stay on the air.Now, there are better comedies available for sure, but UHF does offer some good laughs in the company of Weird Al Yankovic, Michael Richards, Fran Drescher and Kevin McCarthy.The spoofs on other movies were quite hilarious, especially the one made on Rambo.If you enjoy comedy, and have nothing else to watch, give UHF a chance, it might just be what you are looking for.

UHF TV stations, Weird Al at the height of his popularity, and parodies of popular movies/shows from 80's. The movie is filled with things that should date it to the point of being unenjoyable, yet that doesn't happen. The movie works, even today 26 years later. It doesn't just work. It works really, really well. It's almost baffling that it does. But therein lies the beauty of UHF, you don't need to understand the references. You don't need to know who Weird Al is. The jokes are funny despite this.This movie wouldn't work if it was made today. No one would bother trying to raise $75,000 to run a UHF station when they could make a channel on YouTube for a fraction of the cost. But the UHF station is just a framework to parody a wide range of shows and movies, including the best Rambo parody of all time. But because of that there are a few movies like it. This has kept the movie relevant after all these years. UHF is a must watch classic. If you're a comedy lover, do yourself a favor and watch this film.

When his crazy ideas get in the way of pumping out the orders at the burger joint, his boss Big Edna kicks his ass to the curb. He finds a new employment opportunity via his crazy uncle who owns a UHF station that has no one to run it and is about to go under. Weird Al and his slacker buddy David Bowe start to turn the station around with some truly insane, oddball programming. Things really start happening for them when they give the janitor, Stanley Spadowski his own show. Stanley Spadowski's Clubhouse, a kids show similar to Pee Wee's Playhouse is an instant hit with kids and adults alike and becomes Channel 62's flagship show. They become instantly successful and really tick off the owner of network Channel 8. The owner of Channel 8 is an evil corporate boss that treats people like doormats and will stoop to any level for ratings domination. Kevin McCarthy is great as the evil corporate tyrant opposite of lovable underdog Weird Al. In my opinion Michael Richards(best known as Kramer on hit sitcom Seinfeld) nearly steals the show as janitor superstar Stanley Spadowski. He is truly at his best here. There are a lot of TV and movie spoofs. Some of them work and are real funny and others are less funny and don't work so well. Weird Al was really cooking with this insane feature and UHF is real funny, off the wall and creative.

Back in those days, we still had two band selections on the TV and VHF was where all the good programming was. UHF had a lot of channels but only a few were used and people did not switch to UHF often unless they wanted to watch a community channel, church service, foreign language show or some other oddity. You need to understand this before you watch the movie so ask someone older if you are young. Given that, it is a pretty funny idea for a movie and the mock commercials and TV shows are a laugh. True to name, Al finds lots of weird people to play parts in the movie and work with him-some with a touch of late 80's nerdity about them as well. It had a few stretches-like I cannot see a whole bar captivated by a low IQ person lecturing the value of character over a mop.

Al must have mingled with the right circles on the comedy scene, though, because an odd blend of before-they-weres fill out UHF's cast Fran Drescher, Victoria Jackson and an especially hyperactive, scene-stealing Michael Richards would all go on to bigger things later in life.

I was very excited to finally see Al's only film and I wish he could have done more. Of course he could still do movies today but if UHF had become popular Weird Al could have been in many more films afterwards. Anyway, let me get to the review.So this film is basically a comedy film that tries to parody popular movies throughout the film. It is kind of like a classic Epic Movie or Scary Movie but much, much better. I didn't find everything funny, in fact some of the comedy was just stupid. Thankfully, there were funny moments that I will never forget. The oriental karate guy was hilarious and the spatula city and the buzzsaw scene were pretty funny. The first Uncle Nutzie scene made me laugh because Weird Al and the clown made me have a genuine feeling of sorrow for them because of how bad they failed. Of course, that scene was hilarious as well. There were of course absurd scenes that absolutely was unneeded and there was some below average acting but overrall this was a good movie that i will probably be watching again and again.

As if that wasn't enough, we switched over to the version dubbed into German and watched the whole thing again. Neither of us speak German, nor did we need to. Jay Levey's direction is so well-executed that even without the dialogue, its clear what is happening. I played the film in German at the video store I work at it got a huge response. Pretty much EVERYONE wanted to borrow a copy. YOU MUST TRY THIS! IT'S HILARIOUS! The German actors who lend their voices seem to really understand the comic style of the film because their intonation and emphasis is side-splittingly spot on and even funnier than the original English! Yankovic is no actor and it shows, but hearing his voice dubbed by a professional actor really lifts the material. The DVD also contains versions dubbed into French, Italian and Spanish - which are fun, though not as funny - but this perhaps gives audiences a better indication of the broad appeal of this film. Buy it. Watch it. Laugh out loud!

Weird Al is a great comic talent, all the scenes with him are golden. He even does a music video about the Beverly Hillbillies. Awesome! The movie opens with him doing the best Indiana Jones parody of all time. This is worth buying for that scene alone! So he plays George, a man who's given control of his own TV station by his uncle. George has a few ideas for shows, but none of them are successful until a slow-witted janitor named Stanley (Michael Richards) becomes a character on a kids' show that everyone loves. As the station becomes more popular, you see very hilarious segments such as Wheel of Fish, Conan the Librarian and Ghandi II, just to name a few. They have to be seen to be believed. Pretty soon, the station is #1. And that's when things go downhill... You see, a rival station wants to buy them out, and it's run by an evil boss who has henchmen that carry guns. It's so stupid. So George and Stanley have to raise enough money to save the station, and things start to get unfunny. Kevin McCarthy is annoying as the antagonist, and he puts a stop to all the comedy. Michael Richards is also annoying. His character Stanley is just plain bad, and he gets more screen time than he deserves. After some painful scenes that have zero comedy, Stanley is captured by henchmen, and George rescues him in an excellent Rambo parody, which is funny and refreshing. So as you can probably guess, George's station is eventually saved, but then the movie ends. The plot about trying to save the station has feel-good moments, but it's not funny at all, and the segments stop. I feel that the second half of the movie gives the first half a big middle-finger. So overall, I would recommend this film, but keep in mind that once the station becomes #1, things get disappointing.

This kind of stuff you see in South Park, and The Simpsons, but UHF is virtually free of th nasty sarcastic humor which puts off a lot of parents. The real reason to see UHF however is for comedic genius Weird Al Yankovic. For those of you who don't know, he writes parodies of pop songs. His best hits of the 1980's include 'Like a Sugeon', 'Eat it', and 'Fat'. Al plays George Newman, your average loser who can't seem to function in any job he gets, until one day his rich uncle offers him a chance to operate his UHF TV station. At first things don't go so well, until an unlikely turn of events leads to it becoming the #1 station in town. Suddenly there is trouble. George's uncle decides to sell the station to pay off a debt to his nasty boss, George must find a way to save the station with the help of his buddy Bob and TV star/ Janitor Stanley Spedouski.There are so many kinds of jokes in UHF ranging from Monty Python type absurdities (ex. Wheel of Fish), to film parodies, including Blazing Saddles, Gone with the Wind, Raiders of the Lost Arc, and Star Wars.UHF is practically a family comedy, except for some occasional mature humor, which might not be suitable for little kids. Ages ten and up is probably appropriate for UHF. Whether you are a Weird Al fan or not, you may find this a lovable film.

The film is ripe with memorable parodies and great visuals (Richards pulls a foot-long booger from his nose and Yankovic is flattened into a pancake during a RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK parody). Some of the humor is stupid, like the sight of Conan the Librarian chopping an overdue-book holder in half; while some of it you may have to watch twice to catch or fully appreciate.In a lot of ways, UHF is like one of Yankovic's songs.

This to me goes in the same class of movies as the classics Strange Brew, A Christmas Story, Dumb & Dumber, and The Jerk. If you like those sorts of movies you will love this film. There is really just a dumb plot in place in order to spoof all sorts of films, and make really funny plain ol' ridiculous situations.

I have been a fan of Weird Al Yankovic since the beginning and he never fails to disappoint. The premise of the movie is simple, George Neuman (Yankovic) is a daydreamer who goes from job to job until he becomes the manager at a UHF TV station owned by his Uncle Harvey who won it in a poker game. With the help of his buddy Bob(David Bowe) and janitor turned TV star Stanley Spadowski(Michael Richards) The TV station becomes number 1 in the ratings. This does not make R.J. Fletcher of network affiliate channel 8 happy as he is losing money and ratings because of UHF channel 62, but because of Uncle Harveys gambling debts he attempts to buy the station and turn it into a parking lot. So its up to George, Teri(Victoria Jackson) Stanley and Bob to find a way to raise the money to save the station. George runs wild with ideas for new shows which are some of the funniest scenes in a movie, such as Wheel of Fish, Stay fit with Mike and Spike, and my personal favorite Rauls Wild Kingdom. The movie's cast includes legendary actor Kevin McCarthy and the late great Billy Barty. Also, be sure to catch a cameo by comedian Emo Phillips in an extremely funny scene. UHF is one station to tune into.

His particular brand of hilarity makes for a real treat for any fan of his... however, unless you submerge yourself entirely into the mind-state of it, you'll find yourself moaning almost as often as laughing... and for some people, the moaning will be constant, probably followed by simply turning the film off. This is not a film for everyone; despite my having been a fan of Al for about a third of my life, I was bored watching this film more often than not. There are some of the best moments of movie parodying in this... unlike many spoof flicks, they are not marred by the implication of low-brow humor and overdone gags. Most of the humor works perfectly. Only few jokes and gags are overplayed or don't work. Of course, again, it requires that you enjoy Al's humor, so many won't like this film at all. The plot is pretty standard stuff... underdog fights to make something of himself. The plot develops like you'd expect it to, no real surprises. Of course, neither director nor writers are veterans at this... since they are basically Al himself and his manager. That ensures that the film is full of one thing... Al. There is so much Al in this film that it's bursting with Al. It's an Al-bomb. There is plenty of Al for everyone. Anyone who likes Al should get this movie for that very reason. I dare any fan of him to watch this and not laugh. No matter how bad of a mood you're in. The acting is pretty good. The characters are well-written, though most of them are essentially stereotypes. The comedy is mostly very good. The many tiny Al-moments, many of them barely involved in the actual plot keeps you viewing. Sometimes just to see what he comes up with next. This is one to watch for every fan of Al. Put it on, sit back, laugh, cry, find yourself wondering how he ever got allowed to make such a movie. I recommend this to any fan of Al, great or small.

It's a true feel-good film...great characters that you care about getting in over their heads and then triumphing over rotten bad guys by using their imaginations and working together. The cast is extraordinary... Michael Richards, best known as Kramer from Seinfeld, is utterly perfect as a lonely man-child whose natural silliness makes him the perfect kids-show host. Weird Al Yankovic stars as George, a chronic daydreamer who's given one chance to run a small UHF TV station, which allows him to, as girlfriend Teri (SNL vet Victoria Jackson) puts it, let that overactive imagination work FOR (him) instead of against (him). Fran Drescher puts in a charming performance as an amateur anchorwoman, and Gedde Watanabe is inspired as a karate teacher who is a friend and neighbor to George as well as a really handy guy to have around. The rest of the cast fill their roles flawlessly in this broad comedy. If you enjoy the random silliness of Monty Python, UHF is likely to crack you up. "},{"Title":"A hilarious classic.

I have most of his CDs, and they're a hoot. With that said, let me begin.UHF was released in 1989, but went out of print around 1996, making the VHS version very hard to find. I had to buy one from eBay for around $40. And now, the DVD is out where you can get it for less that $10! A lot of critics don't like it, but I find it very funny.UHF starts off as a funny parody of Raiders of the Lost Ark with Al going into a cave for a hidden treasure (an Oscar, as we see). That turns out to be just a fantasy sequence; we see Al as an employee of Big Edna's Burger World. He, along with his friend Bob (David Bowe), get fired Al's character George Newman burns fries and insults Big Edna.We then learn that Al can't keep a job and his girlfriend Teri's (SNL's Victoria Jackson) relationship with him is strained. George's uncle Harvey (Stanley Brock) gives him a small UHF station, channel 62, that he won from a poker game.Basically, the rest of the movie is about UHF's zany hi-jinks and shows. Kevin McCarthy gives a great comedic performance as the president of network Channel 8, that feels threatened, because with U62's wacky shows, they're getting more viewers. Some of U62's shows include Conan the Libraian, Celibrity Mud Wrestling, and The Volcano Worshipers Hour. Along the way, Michael Richards comes in as janitor Stanley Spadowski, who is the funnies part of the movie. Stanley is just a big kid himself, telling Mr. Coyote to watch out! while watching cartoons.Stanley gets his own hit show, Stanley Spadowski's Clubhouse, that everybody loves. Along with Stanley, George gets some other people to do shows, like his friend Kuni (Gedde Watanabe) who hosts Wheel of Fish, and Raul, who hosts Raul's Wild Kingdom, where he teaches poodles how to fly! All of UHF's humor is basically in the shows that U62 produces. But Channel 8 is very funny with R.J. Fletcher's (president of Channel 8's) son Richard's relationship to U62 cameraman Noodles MacIntosh (Billy Barty, who you may remember as a munchkin from The Wizard of Oz), and the hobo is memorable.So if you want a laugh-out-loud-and-you-can't-stop movie, rent, or better, buy, UHF. The commentary by Al and director Jay Levey is great, maybe the best commentary I've ever heard. Al knows tidbits of the addresses of the locations to every cut scene. A few guests come into the studio during the commentary; it's worth a listen!My rating 9/10Rated PG-13 for cartoony violence. "},{"Title":"Weird Al has that name for a reason!

In the past I have been a fan of Weird Al Yankovic, but I didn't enjoy this movie very much. I found it a chore to watch, such was the ongoing silliness.The movie has a very clever beginning, a close parody of the beginning of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Yankovic is the Indiana Jones character, going into the web-covered cave entrance to harvest the gold statue. But this statue is not an antiquity. No, it is an Oscar!! He even has to escape under the closing stone door and outrun a giant round bolder. But the scene ends with more silliness as the bolder chases him all over the world and finally squashes him.All that was a daydream as Yankovic, as George Newman, is on his job as a burger and fries cook. He of course gets fired. But, at the same time his uncle is winning a dilapidated UHF TV station in a poker game, channel 62, and his wife gets him to make George the station manager.It is interesting to see Michael Richards (Kramer of Seinfeld) as the dim-witted janitor Stanley Spadowski, who gets fired from a rival TV station and goes to work for channel 62. He gets an opportunity to go on air, becomes a hit with a children's show.We also get to see the diminutive and great Billy Barty as Noodles MacIntosh, cameraman. Also Fran Drescher as Pamela Finklestein who also worked for the station. Really a fine cast of actors, I just didn't find the whole movie very interesting, just a bit weird and silly.

It was a more innocent time then, when words like spatula and fish were funny. When the music of novelty act Weird Al Yankovic seemed fresh and original. Lamentably, those days are gone now. It is impossible to view UFH and obtain the same reaction as I had then. Seeing it now only brings me to the conclusion that it is an uneven comedy with some amusing gags thrown in.The story is fairly thin and functions mostly as a clothesline to pin jokes on. Weird Al plays George Newman, a day dreaming half-wit, who inherits a failing television station from his uncle. He is helped along by his friend, and fellow dunce, Bob (David Bowe), as well as the mixed bag of oddballs who work at the station There is Pamela Finklestein (Fran Dresher), the abrasive news broad; Noodles (Billy Barty) the dwarfish cameraman; Philo (Anthony Geary) the station's engineer who also hosts a science show and explains how to make plutonium from common household items, amongst other things. George also enlists his neighbor, Kuni (Gedde Watanabe), for the gameshow 'Wheel of Fish', and who verbally assaults the contestants when they lose. There is also a subplot involving George's long suffering (how long depends on the length of time she has been dating George) girlfriend Teri (Victoria Jackson). When George decides to turn over 'Uncle Nutsy's Clubhouse' to the spastic janitor, Stanley Spadowski (Michael Richards), the show becomes a smash hit in the ratings. This raises the ire of the local network affiliate headed by requisite lout R.J. Fletcher (Kevin McCarthy). Wackiness ensue as R.J. orders the kidnapping of Stanley during a desperate fundraiser to save George's station from ruin. Will George triumph over adversity, or will the big/evil network seize his assets and drive him to suicide? I will personally send $.37 (US) to anyone who cannot answer this question correctly.The outcome is of little importance anyway, it's about the jokes. The humor in UHF ranges from painfully obvious to sophomoric. There are few real laughs in the film and most of those are from the quick asides or transitional material. A good example of this is the 'Wild Kingdom'-esquire program where Raul Hernandez (Trinidad Silva) shakes the ant farms and teaches poodles how to fly. There is still something funny about throwing dogs out of a window (I can't explain it) and these scenes are helped along by Silva's delivery. The 'Conan the Librarian' sketch and the GANDHI spoof are both funny (if on-the-nose), accented by Monty Python type bloodshed. The overlong RAMBO sequence near the end has its few fleeting moments as well. In fact the jokes seem to work best when they do not involve Yankovic at all. His performance here conjures about as much humor as watching someone have a seizure in a public place. I still have a special space in my heart for Weird Al, but he is hard to take for an extended period of time. This is not helped by the flat camera work. The director, Jay Levey, seems to just turn the camera on, leaving the room afterward, perhaps for noon cocktails at the catering truck.But enough talk; it would seem nearly impossible to write a serious review of UHF. The film has achieved somewhat of a cult following and the DVD presentation is lavish. I figure this is because there will always be fourteen year old boys (and girls, though less of them) who will like UHF. Weird Al is still out there doing his thing, which means that this film will be perpetually rediscovered. Looking back, I don't find as many things as funny as I once did, but if UHF is on I'll watch it. It will also remind me of a time when I didn't demand so much from a movie; when stupid charm and ridiculous characters were enough.

It is difficult to watch the likes of Smells Like Nirvana or Aamish Paradise without laughing out loud. Surely, then, having him write his own film, and feature the likes of Michael Richards (Kramer from Seinfeld) Fran Drescher (The Nanny) and Victoria Jackson (Saturday Night Live) would be a recipe for comedy gold? Unfortunately, nothing could be further from the truth.UHF is simply an unfunny, formulaic, clichéd and utterly bland experience. It follows an incredibly well-worn path - no-hoper gets big chance, succeeds against all odds by being totally unconventional, is threatened by the powers that be and eventually wins the day and the girl, with the corporate powerhouse enemies getting their just deserts. It offers no parody, no spin, no originality. The film has a total lack of memorable lines, in such stark contrast to Al's songs, and the humour comes from either low-grade comedy (kicks in the groin, dogs being thrown out a window, etc) and over-the-top characters. Acting seems to consist of mugging for the camera, with only David Bowe and Kevin McCarthy making any real attempt at being remotely normal.Perhaps the most remarkable thing is the lack of songs in the film. Elvis at least had the sense to do a few numbers in his films. While the film does contain movie parodies, they are certainly not up to the standard of Al's songs. A single Al music video is far more entertaining than the entire film.Budget problems are blamed repeatedly in the commentary, but it doesn't take a huge budget to come up with a decent plot or funny lines. Indeed, the parodies of films like Rambo and Indiana Jones actually look reasonably good, though far from original, entertaining and anything less than self-indulgent. The few laughs come from the commentary track, and then the best ones are from Al reading out horrible reviews. Jey Levey contributes so little in the commentary that it is perhaps no surprise the film he co-wrote was so unimaginative. Drescher, Richards, Jackson and Emo Phillips make random cameos in it as well.Perhaps the most startling feature of the DVD is the deleted scenes, which feature so many astonishingly bad, unfunny moments that it is incomprehensible how the original script was ever approved, let alone how they were filmed. At least somebody had the sense to cut them out, though they aren't that much worse than the dross that remains.The only real entertainment value in looking back at the film is watching several actors in roles before they were stars. Perhaps the most remarkable is David Proval as head thug, well before he became known as Richie Aprile in The Sopranos. Considering that he plays the roles almost identically, it's very hard to watch season 2 of The Sopranos after watching UHF...

It has moments when you manage a chuckle and yes, the puppy shoot was one of those moments, but other then that it's substandard comedy. You have stock characters placed in an uneven film, peppered with somewhat funny spoofs, and pitched as a feature length film.

That video of Weird Al in the Beverly Hillbillies was cool and I love the UHF song, but the movie blew like Hurricane Fredrick.But don't worry, Al, you're still cool with me. You tried your best. My recommendation watch something else!- "}{"Title":"From a Weird Al Fan...","Date":"26 June 2012","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" Let me start off by saying I am an AVID Weird Al fan. I have all his albums, I know most of his songs by heart, backwards and forwards. I can name every member of his band and I sincerely cried the day his parents were found dead in their home.THAT said, let's discuss UHF.This movie is AWFUL. It's not funny, it's poorly written, and it seems to go on forever. The best part - by FAR - is the guy who throws poodles out his window in an attempt to make them fly. There. Was that funny? Not really? Of course not. Because it's not funny. Michael Richards isn't funny either, in fact, he's hard to watch. I can only stand seeing a grown man act like a retard for about... well, three seconds, tops. And he's in this for what feels like hours upon hours.I love you, Weird Al. You're a good man and a truly talented comedian. But UHF absolutely sucks balls.

He managed to make a movie about public access television that is just as bad and hard to watch as public access television! Form fits function here...But in all serious, I think the real issue with this movie is simply that most of the gags and references are tired. Indiana Jones, Rambo, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, all movies that have been parodied again and again and again, in usually zanier and better paced farces. This whole movie feels rather slow, with too much dead time between gags and barely enough of a plot to keep going.On the other hand, just like the never-ending series of teacher-fixing-dysfunctional-schools movies, UHF manages to appeal towards the underdog sentiment with at least some amount of sincerity and benevolence. It's a geeks dream and for that alone it's not worth trashing. Nevertheless the only lasting legacy it has is its box office failure and Yankovich's 80s curl.--PolarisDiB "},{"Title":"What happened, Al?","Date":"5 December 2001","Score":"3 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  I was excited when this movie was released back in 1989.  I was ten then, and I thought Al was God.  I initially enjoyed the film, but as I grew older, I realized how mediocre UHF was.  Yes, it did have its moments, but overall, the picture was unfunny and difficult to watch.UHF, you receive *1/2 out of ****.

Why? I absolutely do not know what he was thinking. I do know that his skills are completely wasted in this dreadfully unfunny disaster. This is one of the least funny, flattest, most contrived and absurd comedies I have ever seen. You can almost hear the jokes fall off the screen with a loud thud. Nothing in this movie works. Nothing. I don't think I laughed once.The plot revolves around Weird Al winning an old public-service television station and trying to turn it into a family-friendly comedy network before -- you guessed it -- an evil mogul snatches it out of his hands. I sure hope you won't report me to the spoiler police for revealing that highly original plot point to you. Along the way, Al comes up with several gimmicky shows for the station, all of which are showcased in a slow, tedious, unfunny way. First is a spoof on Wheel of Fortune entitled Wheel of Fish, in which the winning contestant wins his or her weight in fish! Tee hee. After this introduction, we are forced to watch a five-minute clip of Wheel of Fish in which everyone involved desperately tries to squeeze giggles out of this dreadful gag. No such luck. Equally unsuccessful is a vignette involving a children's show hosted by a retarded janitor named Stanley Spadowski (played by the same guy who played Kramer in Seinfeld), in which the aforementioned janitor runs around acting like ... himself. Like Wheel of Fish and all of the other segments, this scene isn't funny, it's just forced and embarrassing to watch.Before you reply that I just don't get it, let me assert that I do. Like I said, I'm a big fan of Weird Al. His parodies of popular music leave me in stitches. But his talents obviously do not extend to the realm of movie making, as UHF has taught us. Stick to the Jacko parodies, Al.

It is overly stupid and not as good as some of Weird Al's later videos.  It's mainly a bunch of overacted stuff thrown together.  Parts of it are funny but the other parts that are stupid outweigh the good stuff.  I'd give this a 4 out of 10.

He told me the movies was totally hallarious but when I saw the movie it was terrible. I think you have to be really weird if you want to call this comedy. It's about a  guy who tries to take over a radio station but it doesn't go well for him at first but then he has lame shows and tries to hire anybody even if the person has no television experience. It goes on an on because later they have to raise $ $ $ to save the station and eventually they do but I consider this movie for a kid that is under the age of sixth grade. Personally I didn't enjoy this movie. "}]
