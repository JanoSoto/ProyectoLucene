[{"Title":"standard but moving story","Date":"31 July 2000","Score":"31 out of 35 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Music","Review":"  I must confess that I approached `Music of the Heart' with a great deal of fear and trepidation.  I really had no desire to subject myself to what I envisioned to be a 124-minute barrage of inspirational life messages and feel-good sentimentality.  What a pleasant surprise then to discover this to be a genuinely moving and heartwarming true-life tale of an extraordinary teacher, Roberta Gaspari, and her equally extraordinary students. In plot, `Music of the Heart' doesn't deviate much from the standard formula common to such films.  We have, first, the neophyte white middle class  schoolteacher, plunged into the heart of a problem-ridden inner city Harlem school, filled with burnt-out teachers who have learned to expect little (and thereby garner little) from the youngsters placed in their charge and children themselves whose troubled home lives provide little in the way of a nurturing environment for academic achievement.  We encounter the predictable first-day stumbles of this headstrong, idealistic newcomer as the students challenge her authority and the relevance of her violin class in no uncertain terms; we see how, through discipline and the sheer force of her own determination, she eventually connects them to the music they are learning to play, building their self-confidence and slowly winning the respect of their often skeptical, and, occasionally, downright hostile parents in the process.  Then comes the great challenge, as the school board, after ten successful years in which the program has earned a sizable reputation and even been featured in magazine articles, pulls the plug on the funding.  Thanks to the sheer determination of Gaspari, the parents whose children's lives have been forever altered, a magazine writer and the voluntary participation of a number of the world's premiere violinists (a large number of whom appear as themselves in the film), the group stages an amazing fundraising concert at Carnegie Hall, the proceeds from which save the program and help ensure its survival for the next several years.One of the chief reasons that `Music of the Heart' does not dissolve (as it so easily might have) into a puddle of goopy tears lies in the matter-of-fact interpretation of the main character that both writer, Pamela Gray, and actress, Meryl Streep, bring to bear on the role.  At no time is Roberta ever portrayed as a saintly figure.  In fact, she is a woman filled with all sorts of insecurities and vulnerabilities, exacerbated by the devastating sense of bewilderment and loss caused by the unexpected termination of her marriage and her seeming need to be dependent on a man for comfort, support and a sense of purpose.  She is often overbearing, pushy and pigheaded and not just in the classroom where it counts, but also in her personal life where it often alienates her from the ones she loves most.  Yet, somehow out of this mass of self-doubts and personal missteps, she finds the inner strength and emotional wherewithal to work miracles.  Streep throws herself so completely into the role that we cannot take our eyes off her for a single one of the film's 120 enthralling minutes (and I doubt that she is ever off screen for more than a few seconds in the entire film).  It is a truly glowing performance.Equally impressive, director Wes Craven is to be highly commended for drawing such an impressive array of credible, down-to-earth performances from a large cast of outstanding preteen actors.  Thanks to them and an air of naturalism in the dialogue, the scenes between the youngsters and their teacher always ring true and believable.I defy anyone - even the most tone deaf, musically disinterested member of the audience  - not to be deeply touched by the final scenes of this film.  Craven, from all his years doing those slasher films I suppose, really knows how to generate a sense of suspense as we follow the pre-show behind-the-scenes preparations of the nail-biting participants.  The recreated concert itself, with a number of the real life participants brought back to play for the occasion, is utterly engrossing and leaves the audience both rheumy-eyed and covered with goose bumps.  Well, maybe Music of the Heart is, after all, filled with the `inspirational life messages' and `feel-good sentimentality' I so dreaded at the outset of the film.  That being the case, I guess that isn't such a bad thing after all!

Which it now is. Meryl Streep, in the lead role, is nothing short of fantastic. She studied violin virtually every day, for 2 to 4 hours a day, for 3 months because she insisted on doing all her on-screen playing. She was so good that duing warm-up for the Carnegie Hall scene, famous violinists Issac Stern and Jascha Heifitz stood in amazement at how good she was. Watching the movie, I honestly became unaware that she was an actress in a movie, and that seldom happens with me.The most enjoyable scenes were those showing young children make music. And the Carnegie Hall performance, with all those real-world virtuoso violinists, is one of the most moving scenes imaginable, when you consider what had transpired leading up to it.This movie is based on the real story of a real music teacher in Harlem. It is a wonderful story of how one person through love and persistence can affect so many in such a positive way. This movie, unlike most, will stay with me for a long, long time.

Seems like a joke at first, but it really isn't. Music of the Heart is the second film that horror director Wes Craven has made and surpasses his first non-horror film, Vampire in Brooklyn.It based on the life of Roberta Guaspari (Streep), a violin teacher who moves to East Harlem with her two sons after her husband left her for another woman. Roberta starts a program of her own, teaching young kids how to play the violin. One mother of one of her students describes it as dead white man music, but Roberta uses the late Arthur Ashe, who was black and a great tennis player as a great example. In another scene, the mother tells Roberta that she was right.Ten years later, Roberta has taught over a thousand children how to play the violin and some of her former students have either gone onto college or become violinists. A problem surfaces, the superintendent and board of education have made budget cuts. Roberta is told by Janet Williams (Angela Bassett), the princpal that the music program has been cut.So Roberta vows to keep the program alive and gets the idea of having a benefit concert. She gets help from some of her friends and some parents to help promote the concert and the place where it'll be held. Bad news, the first place where the concert is going to be held in has a flood. The only other place that is mentioned is Carnegie Hall in Philadelphia.The concert scene is one of the best scenes in the movie. Some of Roberta's first students come back to join some of current her pupils. Also, some of the best-known violinists in the world have come as well, Issac Stern, Mark O'Connor, Arnold Steinhardt, and Itzhak Perlman are among them. Watching O'Connor play was fun to see. I admit that is the concert is memorable and great to watch as the one put up in The Blues Brothers.The emotional energy in this film never lets down at one moment. Bassett, Quinn, and Jay O. Sanders are good in their supporting roles. The movie is great and it stays with the story. Wes Craven deserved an Oscar nomination for Best Director and Streep is great.

When the movie opens, she has recently moved herself and her two sons in with her mother, after her marriage fails. Roberta (Meryl Streep) takes her limited teaching experience and pitches a violin class to a skeptical principal (Angela Bassett).  After proving how well she's taught her young sons the instrument, Roberta is given a chance.  It is slow going at first, as Roberta has to deal with inattentive students, and disapproving parents and fellow teachers.  One African-American parent snaps that her son has better things to do than learn dead white men's music, even though her son lights up while he's taking his music lessons. The violin program grows so much in popularity that kids have to enter a lottery to get a chance to get into it.  When the program is cut due to the insensitive school system, Roberta fights back.  Film hits the message home that music education is important, but it keeps repeating it over and over.  The audience got the point, already!  Streep does portray a likeable underdog, though, and the love she has for the students is always apparent, even when she's snapping at them.  The kids are adorable.  Don't be fooled, however, by how the trailers build up Gloria Estefan's participation in the movie.  She's okay, but her role is very small.  Angela Bassett is effective, as usual.

Of course, as the go-to-guy for horror movies, my least favourite genre, I had to scan through his filmography to find the bizarrely out-of-character film Music of the Heart. As the only non-horror film on the list, it won the honour fairly easily.It surprises me to no end that a horror film maestro could create what is probably one of the best feel-good movies I have ever seen. I can pick a passion project when I see it, and I am positive that Craven was passionate about this story and to telling it right. When I was growing up, music lessons were everything to me. You could escape into a whole other world when you practised, and the instrument became a friend when none other might be. This film captured that more than any other I've seen. For a character who looks and sounds like Meryl Streep, it is amazing how much Meryl Streep vanishes into Roberta. She captures with full conviction the passion she has for her music, whilst also layering her character with personality quirks that inform us why her marriage has broken down. Streep layers that with bursts of anger, sadness and even humour that never feel out of place because they feel like Roberta's real emotions. She could have walked into my high school's music department and wouldn't have felt even a little bit out of place. This is probably my favourite ever Meryl Streep performance. From an unknown supporting cast, Angela Basset is stunningly effective as Janet, a Harlem principal holding a school together with her bare hands.The film essentially splits into two halves, with a ten year break in between. The first is Roberta's struggle to deal with the breakdown of her marriage and her desire to make the program work not to help the kids, but to make ends meet. But as the first act goes on, interactions with the kids show her how much the program means to them - even the troublemakers who give her flack but show up week after week in spite of everything. In the second half, ten years later than the first, Roberta's program is in jeopardy and she must fight to maintain it, because she has seen now how much good it can do. The relationship between Roberta and the kids - especially Jade Yorker's DeSean and Victoria Gomez's Lucy - is beautiful and believable, even as she occasionally hits stumbling blocks associated with kids in Harlem - incidental murders, domestic violence and hostility from black parents. Screenwriter Pamela Gray does a terrific job avoiding the trappings of White Saviour but focusing more on how music helps children, regardless of who their teacher is. Sometimes I felt that there were a few unnecessary subplots, such as Roberta's love life - both of her love interests fizzle out without much impact on the story. Other times, serious moments are swept over quickly, like when a father and daughter turn up to the concert announcing they took the car and violin, which is quickly ignored. But I watched this film with a smile on my face the whole way through - just as the proud parents beamed at their underprivileged children performing beautiful music on stage. I would never have though to find such a feel-good movie in the filmography of a great horror director, but it just goes to show that just like music in the hearts of Harlem, you should never judge a book by its cover.

Although Roberta sees her life falling apart, with a little help she manages to get a job in an inner city school teaching violin. Soon this small class begins to help the people in the community as well as Roberta being able to see the power of music.MUSIC OF THE HEART was pretty much overlooked by fans of Wes Craven when it was released and, to be honest, the fans haven't bothered with it to this day, which is really too bad. I'm ashamed to admit that it took me this long to actually watch the movie because it's certainly one of the best films that Craven ever did and it's obvious just by watching it that the material was very close to his heart. Craven at one time was a teacher so it's clear that he had a passion for this material and it easily comes through his very sentimental direction.Of course, it's certainly doesn't hurt when you've got someone like Meryl Streep delivering one of her grand performances that only she can. It's really amazing watching this actress because she makes it seem so easy yet when you really look at this character it's easy to see the challenged. This character really is all over the place throughout the movie in regards to the emotions that she displays yet Street touches on all of them. It's really amazing to see how much passion she brings to the role and you can't help but see a real violin teacher. The supporting cast features fine performances by all of the children as well as the likes of Angela Bassett, Aidan Quinn and Cloris Leachman.The violin music itself is also extremely good and the technical side of the film is all very good. Craven certainly manages to keep the film moving at a very good pace and there's no question that there's a lot of heart in the picture and this comes through whenever a dramatic moment comes up. I'm certainly not going to spoil some of the twists that happen but they're all handled in a very tender way proving that the director was certainly able to deliver more than just horror. MUSIC OF THE HEART features a terrific performance from Streep and fine direction by Craven and it deserves to be seen.

Meryl Streep received one of her innumerable Best Actress Oscar nominations for playing Roberta Guaspari who creates and heads a program for inner city youth. It's not that Streep has the most impressive of resumes when she applies for the job with Principal Angela Bassett. But music is not a big priority in school funding. But she happens to have purchased 50 violins from abroad for another of her projects. That kind of donation no principal can pass up so Streep gets the job.The film divides neatly in half showing first Streep's early days in creating her violin class and then secondly trying to keep it alive during one of those perennial financial crisis that public education always seems to be having. In the tradition of Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney, what do we do but put on a show.The film this really reminds of is a Samuel Goldwyn Production from the late Thirties titled They Shall Have Music. Gene Reynolds plays an inner city kid who also learns the violin and gets to appear with none other than Jascha Heifetz in a show.Music Of The Heart sees your Heifetz with an Isaac Stern and raises with among others Itzhak Perlman and a number of classical artists who make guest appearances and support Streep and her program. The result, as this is a throwback film to old Hollywood need I tell you?Streep has her personal problems as well, she was a Navy wife who has split from her husband and has two sons, both of whom she has raised to appreciate classical music. She gives all to her kids and her program and loses a few men who'd like to get something going with her, among them Aidan Quinn. She also moves into the East Harlem area where she teaches and truly enters the fabric of her pupil's lives.She gets good support from a nicely chosen ensemble cast, but this film is truly the personal property of Meryl Streep and is joyously recommended to one and all who like classical music.

Opus 118 was initially created to save the famous violin program created and led by Guaspari from the looming government budget cuts but later expanded its vision to serve public school students of low income by engaging them in the field of musical education. As you might guess, despite of or, perhaps, thanks to being based on a true story, the movie is quite inspirational, very stereotypical, and thus predictable &#x96; a gifted, passionate, innovative teacher, struggling in personal life, a wise school principle deciding to give her a chance, skeptical colleagues, difficult at first kids from low-income families, challenges to overcome, and, of course, traditional Hollywood happy end &#x96; this time in the form of a triumphant all-star concert at Carnegie Hall. And yet there is something in Music of the Heart that elevates it from the comfortable, formulaic, cookie-cutter industrial mediocrity to the noble and mysterious realm of art. And moreover, there is also something that transforms a seemingly undistinguished happy ending story from the closing decade of the last century into a bitter tale, quite relevant more than 20 years after it first appeared on big screen.From the art perspective, one cannot help but notice something obvious &#x96; the great Meryl Streep in her nuanced Oscar- nominated performance as Roberta Guaspari. If I were a cinema scholar, I could have covered many pages with a lengthy dissertation on the ultimate professional heights that Meryl Streep so naturally reaches when portraying her characters. But since I am not a scholar, all I could say is this &#x96; you must see this acting magic with your own eyes; very few actors have ever been able to even approach that level of mastery.The distant second but still very important factor that compensates for the deficiencies of the story is the direction of Wes Craven, a classic music lover and a former English professor, who, however, is mostly famous for his influential horror movies (A Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream). The impressive work on Music of the Heart proved that the directing talent of Wes Craven is far more versatile than the one required from a typical horror movie director. My personal opinion is that Wes Craven continuing to explore movie genres other than horror is something that would benefit both the director and cinema in general. I should also mention the solid supporting performances of Angela Bassett as the school principal Janet Williams, Aidan Quinn as Roberta's classmate and romantic interest Brian Turner, and Cloris Leachman as Roberta's mother Assunta Guaspari. I also cannot but mention the wonderful music component of the movie that includes some great pieces written for violin (e.g. Bach's concerto in D minor for Two Violins), the impressive original music score by Mason Daring with its crown jewel - an Oscar-nominated song Music of the Heart and last, but not least - the famous concert scene at Carnegie Hall with the legendary violinists Mark O'Connor, Issac Stern, and Itzhak Perlman joining the movie crew.Besides the Meryl Streep s staggering performance, solid directing, and great music, there is something else that makes the movie from the late 1990s relevant today. I do not think, however, that it was intentional on the part of the movie creators; it looks more like an unintended consequence of their attempt to add traditional family values to the movie mix.One of these values is commitment &#x96; commitment to spouse, commitment to children, commitment to students, friends, coworkers, and finally &#x96; commitment to your higher calling to help those that need you. Being committed? It is so nineties (if not fifties). Nowadays we are so self-absorbed, so preoccupied with self-fulfillment (quickly morphing into self-indulgence), self-actualization and other self- words, that being committed to something or somebody other than oneself or making sacrifices for somebody else's benefit seems to be quickly becoming a rarity, an exception from the common rule.I do not think that it is important whether the commitment theme in the movie was intentional or not. For me it is enough that it reflects a timeless truth, the truth that appears to have been mostly condemned to oblivion these days, when everything seems to be relative, subjective, and conditional even such naturally unconditional thing as commitment.Moreover, nowadays it looks like it is almost fashionable to be uncommitted to anything &#x96; to explore things, to try things, to selfishly jump from one thing to another, to avoid attachments that slow you down on your chosen path and hurt your self-fulfillment perspectives.Those who fall victim of that trend I could only refer to the famous saying of the French icon Jean Cocteau Art produces ugly things which frequently become more beautiful with time. Fashion, on the other hand, produces beautiful things that always become ugly with time. The power of his saying lies in the fact that it applies to life just as it applies to art taking life lightly and following fashion in its important matters equals flirting with disaster.Perhaps, the main lesson of the movie is that becoming a great musician or a famous music teacher, acquiring major titles or achieving professional goals, in other words - investing exclusively into your precious self is not something that would fill your heart with music, your life with harmony, and your existence with higher purpose.The path to the true music of the heart leads in the opposite direction &#x96; to investing in others, cultivating awareness, empathy and compassion, and being committed, faithful, and unselfish in your relationships, both professional and personal.www.knowyourmovie.com "}{"Title":"If you like music AND acting, you'll love this movie","Date":"13 July 2013","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Music","Review":" First of all, Streep practiced the violin for 6 hours a day in preparation for this role.

Good story, lousy script, lousy direction, and horrid acting.  Meryl Streep, as one other respondent mentioned, did not even seem to like the children. She was shrill and harsh.  I think the goal was to be tough, as with Edward James Olmos in a marvelous movie, Stand and Deliver.  Rather, she just appeared mean and ill at ease with children, including her own.  The only redeeming feature was the concert at the end.  That, and it was interesting seeing some of the real students.  Even when her older students came back to support her in the end, she had nothing nice to say to or about them.  I believe that the real Roberta is probably an amazing lady, and this movie has done her a terrible disservice.  For much better movies on similar topics (teachers both tough and loving, creating a love of learning and/or music in the most unlikely of students), see Stand and Deliver, Conroy (both based on true stories), or Mr. Holland's Opus.  In each case, the writing, acting and direction are far superior.

This movie had everything; good acting, name-brand main actors and actresses, a compelling story, social pertinence and a theme of victory over adversity. All the things that I admire and enjoy in a film. The reasons I was only prepared to give what I deem a passing grade to Music of the Heart are these; 1.) What did Mrs. Guaspari do to motivate and engage these students? Bark out orders? 2.) Why, in the absence of Mrs. Guaspari's inspiration, did the students (individually or collectively) want to take up the violin? (We never really get to meet any of the students, nor find out what is important (or at least intriguing) to them. 3.) Why does Mrs. Guaspari not play something impressive for the students, to show what they can accomplish, and how wonderful the violin can sound? ( Initially, to wow the students, 20 seconds of Shostakovich or D'Vorak would have been sufficient, but the film should have been replete with pertinent and brilliant, even if abbreviated, violin music, played by Mrs. Guaspari). 4.) What inspired Mrs. Guaspari to take up the violin, and why does she play? What is her relationship to music?This last point is the most glaring omission in Music of the Heart.It was heart-breaking to see Tanisha informing her teacher that she was moving away and had to quit the classes. Could not have Mrs. Guaspari said, at least, I will call you, if you want. I will continue to help you with your violin.?I appreciated Music of the Heart. I love all movies that have to do with music (especially learning it). The Guaspari family went through a great deal of duress as they tried to make ends meet. In the process, they changed some lives. I just would have liked to have gotten to know the characters more; their inner motivation and dreams.

She never made it as a concert violinist and teach sparingly as she is pulled around the world by her navy husband. An old friend Brian Turner (Aidan Quinn) directs her to Principal Janet Williams (Angela Bassett) who reluctantly hires her as a substitute music teacher in the East Harlem inner city school. All the teachers hate her except Isabel Vasquez (Gloria Estefan).It's a pretty traditional biopic by director Wes Craven who usually does horror. It's not a particularly original true story but it's an effective one. The most impressive thing in this is Meryl Streep. She holds the movie together. There are all the classic hurdles like the intransigent teachers, poverty, angry parents, violent neighborhood, and tough luck kids.

What does this say about Craven? Besides horror, thriller and adult films, he has a passion for something more. Of course, you know, he does hold a masters degree in English and philosophy.Angela Bassett is back in a big way. Those who had only seen Bassett in Craven's Vampire in Brooklyn may not expect much from her, but here she is among her strongest. With Streep getting an Oscar nomination, maybe Bassett deserved one, too.Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four and wrote that Meryl Streep is known for her mastery of accents; she may be the most versatile speaker in the movies. Here you might think she has no accent, unless you've heard her real speaking voice; then you realize that Guaspari's speaking style is no less a particular achievement than Streep's other accents. This is not Streep's voice, but someone else's - with a certain flat quality, as if later education and refinement came after a somewhat unsophisticated childhood. The other music teacher seems a bit one-noted, not believing in the kids. Whether this is supposed to be racism, a commentary on the inner city, or just a dislike of children is unclear. How easily Demetras is able to get their attention seems a bit strange, although she does tend to lose them as time goes on.Where does the reality meet the fiction, or vice versa?

Well, playing the violin costs, and right here is where you start paying, in practice and in sweat! Paraphrasing Debbie Allen's dance teacher from Fame seems so appropriate in describing Meryl Streep in Music From the Heart. Her performance as the real-life violin teacher, Roberta Guaspari, is so filled with the love of music that Debbie Allen's Lydia had for dance in the movie and TV series of Fame. Here, the pupils are not students at New York's school of the performing arts, but second graders in East Harlem. At first, they seem to have more important things to do than be disciplined to play an instrument. But as they gain the discipline and love for what they are being taught, their lives change, their parents change, and so does teacher Streep. Even more changing is the East Harlem neighborhood where Streep teaches and lives, and I should know---I live right down the street from where Guaspari lived (at least in this movie).Supporting Streep magnificently is the wonderful Angela Bassett as the good hearted principal who senses Streep's devotion is needed to help give hope to the children who might otherwise be lost in the tough neighborhood they live in. The dozens of children who supply the music also provide the heart, and it is a joy to watch the lights in their eyes go on as they realize the impact of what they are doing.In smaller roles, Aidan Quinn and Cloris Leachman are very good. Leachman has some nice quick moments as Streep's brittle but loving mother. I really wanted to see more of Gloria Estefan as another teacher who befriends Streep while the other teachers spurn her. A scene which stood out in my mind as being emotionally satisfying is the black mother who earlier had pulled her son out of the class, only to ask Streep to take him back when her cynical eyes open to the magic of what Streep has accomplished. The stony glare and coldness of the scared woman magically disappears once she realizes the impact the violin has had on her son. That's what music is all about.They Shall Have Music, a 1939 movie with a Dead End kids theme is very similar in its narrative about how music can change lives. It featured Javier Havitz, who is mentioned in a tender scene here in Music of the Heart featuring the legendary Isaac Stern. What is amazing for this incredible movie is the direction by none other than horror movie icon Wes Craven.The message of this film is that the only thing every person in this crazy world shares is music, and no matter what language we speak, music will never disappear, and is the one thing that unites us beyond all other barriers.

For me, the most moving part of this film is when the late violinist Isaac Stern appears on stage at Carnegie Hall, addressing in an amazingly warm telling of Carnegie's history, a number of the prior performers who've graced that magnificent stage. Though I wish the final performances of Bach could have been longer, it is absolutely thrilling to see the mentoring of this group of accomplished and noted musicians to the many young children and budding talents that performed with them.

In Music of the Heart, Craven demonstrates his skill with dramatic films and forges a place for himself in the world of non-horror film-making.After suffering an emotionally debilitating break with her husband, Roberta Guaspari gives up on life, packs her kids up, and moves to her mother's house. Her mother (Cloris Leachman) forces Roberta to pick up the pieces of her life and get a job. Coincidentally, Roberta runs into her old friend Brian Turner (Aidan Quinn), who gets her a job as a violin teacher and lets her stay in his apartment until she gets back on her feet. They become sexually involved, and Roberta's kids like Turner. Her students are succeeding at the violin, and everything seems to be picking up for her.In the midst of building a new house, things get rocky for Roberta. She fires her builders and breaks up with Turner. Despite this, she continues to live happily. Years pass, and Roberta's violin program grows into an inner city phenomenon. She teaches students from three different schools in addition to giving private lessons. She remains unattached, but raises her two sons successfully while maintaining her heavy workload. But Roberta's life is thrown into upheaval when the music budget in her district is cut, and she no longer has a program. She puts up a fight that leads her, her best students, and some of the country's finest string musicians to Carnegie Hall.This film has a few strengths that give it an edge above other films in the classroom drama genre. Meryl Streep is an excellent choice for Roberta Guaspari. Her performance is that of an actress at the height of her talent. She is as powerful here as she has been throughout her career, and this film is a mile marker worthy of Kramer vs. Kramer (1979) and Out of Africa (1985). Streep is a broken woman in the first five minutes of Music of the Heart, and her progression from that to a person who is capable of enjoying life on her own terms is understated and believable. Streep demonstrates the range of her talent beautifully. Roberta is both a devastated and a powerful woman, and Streep plays her with passion and grace.We get a good balance of home and school life in this film and this is a credit to the screen writing. Roberta has believable and multi-dimensional relationships with her principal at school (Angela Bassett), her many classes of students, and her children. She goes through a romantic relationship, and both the beginning and the end of that are true to life. The writing here is just consistently good. The film gets a little unbelievable near the end as the Carnegie hall gig approaches, but the problem here may be that this film is based on a real story. The writer, Pamela Gray, had a lot of freedom in character development, and she excelled in this area. But she probably had to stick to a specific set of plot points that forced her to the Hollywood whitewashed conclusion.Craven's directing is good, though at parts it's obvious this is his first successful dramatic film. The only other attempt he made was in 1988 with The Serpent and the Rainbow, a film that examines the Haitian origins of the zombie myth. Though The Serpent and the Rainbow is worth a look as a serious piece, it's still got one foot in the graveyard. For the director's first real drama, Music of the Heart is a pleasant surprise.

Faced with a divorce and raising two sons on her own, Roberta, with the help of a friend, writer Brian Sinclair (Aidan Quinn), finds a job in an East Harlem school teaching violin.  Hired initially as a substitute for two days a week, she struggles to make her program work, competing with a tenured music teacher and less than cooperative students.  A violin program seems out of place in Harlem, and there are some very real racial barriers she must overcome, as well.  That she succeeds at all is due to nothing less than strong-willed determination and tenacity; a former Navy wife who was constantly on the move, she buys her first home, a fixer-upper in Harlem she must renovate to make livable, acting as her own contractor, which adds even more stress to an already overwhelming situation  A single mom living in Harlem, trying to make a life for herself and her boys, while giving selflessly to her students, many of whom soon look to her as their ray of hope in an otherwise seemingly futile environment.  There is triumph and tragedy to her story, but the fact that she was able to help so many young people, and raise the self-esteem of so many individuals as well as that of an entire community, illustrates the difference one person can truly make in our society. 	Streep delivers an Oscar-worthy performance (she was nominated), and as usual, disappears completely into her character.  Indisputably the greatest actress of our times, it never ceases to amaze the way she can take any role and not just play, but become, that person; she is truly a chameleon at her craft, and a joy to watch.  After watching her, you feel as if you really know Roberta; and the fact that she enables you empathize with her so readily heightens the already emotional impact of her story.  It is a touching portrayal that avoids any sentimentality or pretentiousness. 	The supporting cast includes Cloris Leachman (Assunta Guaspari), Angela Bassett (Janet Williams), Jay O. Sanders (Dan), Michael Angarano (Nick, age 7), and features cameos by Isaac Stern, Itzhak Perlman, Sandra Park and Karen Briggs, among others.  Craven has ably delivered a solid and moving film; he keeps everything to scale, keeps it real, never allowing the story to become larger-than-life, one of the pitfalls of many a movie biography, which can so easily diminish the quality of the final product.  Happily, he never allows that to come close to happening in `Music of the Heart.'  This is an unforgettable film, with a memorable performance by Meryl Streep; but in the end, what you'll really remember is Roberta Guaspari.  She is a true, contemporary hero whose song, thankfully, has been sung.  I rate this one 10/10.

I also want to tell you about a really clever thing that I saw in the movie  at first the main character is met with resistance from the administrator and the school's actual music teacher.

Flash-forward ten years the program is still a hit, and the original music teacher's trying to take credit for it!  Didn't see that coming!  Because it is set in the inner city, we get such original characters such as the black mom who doesn't want her son studying the white man's music, and at least one kid dies a young, tragic, violent death.  *SPOILER WARNING* The movie concludes with a race to find new backing for the violin program when the EVIL school district cuts off funding!

The story itself looks quite unbelievable.I myself would never have believed that this was a true story, if it weren't really true (a few years ago already a documentary was made about this, but this movie is better). This movie is a really redeeming one for music-lovers (REAL music, not popmusic) but also for people interested in racial matters. It's quite rare in movies to see black people being portrayed as really nice people (Grand Canyon is another such wonderful film in that respect). Meryl Streep should have won the Oscar again.Makes you realize once more what a totally overrated movie American beauty is. A really great but very surprising delight (I knew nothing about the story) was to see some of the greatest violinists of our time in this movie (Perlman and several others,see cast) playing as themselves. If ever there was a movie that makes you wish it lasted 5 hours it must be this one (but then there's always still the book). I cannot recommend any other movie more than this one!!

Wes Craven's better horror movies have always featured believable and strong protagonists.  For example, Sydney from the Scream series and Nancy from the Elm Street films.Streep's character is just another protagonist along the same lines.  The fact that she is battling personal hardship and the socio-economic factors that her students must contend with instead of a scary monster is very refreshing.  Craven proves with Music of the Heart that he is up to the challenge of directing a non-horror film.  The movie is engaging and very entertaining.

Both Music of the Heart and The Insider raised the question of why producers choose to finance appalling nonsense such as Double Jeopardy and incoherent fantasies such as The Matrix when far superior material lies all around them in real life. An extraordinary fact about Music is that almost every single character is likeable and that the vast majority are actually admirable. The only exceptions are Roberta's cheating husband (only an off-screen presence), the sour and incompetent permanent music teacher (who has good reason to be jealous of his inspirational, but untenured colleague) and Aidan Quinn's appealing but fickle lover. At least the latter bubbles over with irresistible Irish charm and blarney. Some real life musicians appear as themselves, most memorably Isaac Stern whose love, decency and lifelong joy in music shines out from the screen during the brief episode when he describes the famous musical ghosts haunting Carnegie Hall. The whole story is such a glorious relief after a procession of films stuffed with people who are as repulsive as the plots are preposterous.The real difficulties of the Harlem children are portrayed; physical disabilities, crime, single parents, poverty, domestic violence. Meryl Streep's Roberta has her share of shortcomings and problems, as is shown when she struggles with the incompetent contractors she hired to fix up her home or tries to get the charming Aiden to commit to a longer term relationship. But her burning love of music and initially desperate tenacity in teaching these strange inner city kids gradually triumph over all, even mean minded financial cuts. Although it is not mentioned in the film, musical education has enormous benefits in other academic areas, as well as boosting the children's self-esteem and concentration - a fact invisible to the bean counters.Bravo to all concerned, especially to Wes Craven for a project so utterly different from anything he has created before, and to Meryl Streep for another compelling performance.

Roberta turns her own tragedy into a wonderful benefit for her newly adopted community while giving her own life purpose.  Her dedication to teaching children the violin in a Harlem school district, gives her pupils not only an appreciation for music, but a wealth of self confidence and an appreciation for discipline and sacrifice.

The reality of the lives of these children comes across loud and clear, in particular I loved the little Hispanic boy who was so gifted as a violinist, but was afraid of losing his macho image.  The way the film dealt with the loss of child, and the loss of another child's scholarship was treated with compassion and the reality of life in East Harlem or in any inner city for that matter.

If Small Wonders is available on video, it is well worth the watch, before or after seeing the current feature film.  Music of the Heart is Roberta's story, this time presented with well-known actors who honor her life and contributions.  I laughed; I cried.

And that's pretty much the point of this film.  If you think you've seen this story before, you're probably right.Meryl Streep is our title character.  As the film opens, she is living with mom (played by Cloris Leachman) and is still quite shattered by the fact that her husband left her for another woman.  Roberta has two young boys and quite frankly, isn't sure what her next move will be. She meets Aiden Quinn, playing Brian.  Sparks fly, but at the same time he turns her on to a potential job in a Harlem grade school.  She approaches the principal, Angela Basset, for a job.  Of course she is refused at first, but through determination she is able to get her way. There is no point in delving much further into the plot.  You already know that Roberta is going to touch the lives of a few children.  Of course it's obvious that the school board is going to be a challenge to her when they start cutting back their budget.  And don't be too surprised to see her students perform at least one outstanding show, only after several scenes of frustration and hopelessness.I shouldn't be too hard on this film.  While I found it slow and often predictable, there are a few moments worth seeing.  This role is easy stuff for an actress like Streep so naturally she pulls it off.  Bassett is good as the principle, although I hope that her career does not go the way of playing tough black women working in the black community, supporting plucky white women who want to change 'the ghetto.'  She deserves far better than that.  I liked the music in this film and I have to admit that the finale at the end was worth the wait.  Roberta and the kids move into Harlem because Roberta wants to live in the area that she works.  I didn't quite get that, however I suppose I should give her credit.  I just wish the film makers were more honest in their portrayal of life in Harlem. I know that area of Manhatten has a lot of culture and some neat diversity, but I can't believe that the only problems were those pointed out by Angela Bassett's Janet.  I recall she had an exacto knife and a couple of appointments with some kids.  Where were the guns and the drugs we keep reading about?All in all, Music of the Heart is a slow moving, somewhat disappointing film.  We've seen this story before in films like Dangerous Minds and Mr. Holland's Opus.  I'm not too sure why we had to do it again.  I guess I shouldn't totally write off this film.  Anyone with a hunger for sentiment might just find something here.  Anyone looking for another great role from Meryl will just have to wait til next year.

I did not choose to see it but it was chosen by someone else for me to see. I am an ambivalent fan of Meryl Streep. In this film she is absolutely exceptional. It chronicles the trials and tribulations of an individual who is faced with an unhappy marriage break-up, the task of raising two boys and trying to survive financially. She is a violin teacher and a male friend suggests she try for a job in a Harlem school. She cleverly auditions her two boys playing violin to show her teaching expertise just to land a substitute teacher position. Anyone who knows anything about education knows that teaching of the arts is extremely important to building up an individual's self-esteem. It has also been proven scientifically to improve and expand one's mind. In short a person's capacity to think is greatly increased over those not exposed to the arts. The kids in the film are delightful and amazing. These kids intuitively know certain truths. This is a 7 hankie movie. It really tugs at the emotions. I love the climax of the movie and it reminds me of the joke about a chap in New York who asks someone for directions How do you get to Carnegie Hall? His answer is Practise, practise, practise. Not what the person expected but exactly what the teaching ethos of Meryl Streep's character emphasizes.

It should have remained a book. The boyfriend segment that went nowhere should have been left out altogether, as much as I love looking at Aiden Quinn and watching him act. And the flow was made further awkward because here and there, we are shown the main character as not being sympathetic at all, but having a perfectionistic, difficult personality. So who is the woman who the movie was based on? Certainly not a warm and fuzzy type, and yet she does things that help her under-privileged community and students. But it seems like her virtues stem out of a belief-system that poor public school students should be taught to play the violin and anyone can learn the violin-- not from a fully-formed, sympathetic, from the heart woman. ***POSSIBLE SPOILER**... The direction is amateurish with painful cuts from happy face to happy face from an applauding audience at the finale-- including that of the boyfriend that she had left 10 years before applauding wildly like their ending had gone well, and looking like he looked in the last scene we saw him in. Questions beg to be answered. How did all those poor kids get the money to buy the fancy duds for playing at Carnegie Hall? I believe that movies based on modern, real-life people are difficult to make; this one could have stood a LOT more effort in the making.

Unlike most folk, I am not generally a huge Streep fan as I find she tends to over act, but she is perfect here. I think it's her best role ever.The film, based on a true story, tells the tale of a woman named Roberta Demetras, who has recently been left by her husband for another woman, and moves with her two young boys back in with her mother. She manages to obtain a position teaching violin in a Harlem school. Her teaching struggles and personal life (including a long term affair) are chronicled over a decade, culminating in the distressing news that the school board has canceled funding for her music program. However, she comes up the brilliant idea to hold a benefit concert in Carnegie Hall to elicit support.Roberta's classroom struggles are well depicted as, for starters, these kids are perceived as underachievers by their teachers, resulting in low expectations. The violin is a difficult instrument and it requires some doing to convince these underprivileged kids that, not only is it relevant to their lives, but yes, of course they can learn it and can meet her standards. Also, these parents, not exactly classical buffs, are skeptical and sometimes downright hostile. Winning their support takes time. Finally, just when the other hurdles are conquered, the Board of Education challenge...Meryl Streep very skillfully portrays all Roberta's professional trials as well as her personal life story, which is interspersed between the classroom scenes. She has her two boys to raise and also her relationship with her live in lover, Brian, who connects well with her kids.Cameo appearances by famous violinists, including Isaac Stern and Itzhak Perlman, add to the drama.It's a wonderful, inspirational story...and true. These music teacher tales always touch me since my own son played in his school band for seven years, and I saw personally the difference made by the music program in his and the other students' lives. Films such as Mr. Holland's Opus and this one are a tribute to these dedicated music teachers, and serve to highlight their generally unheralded efforts.

This is the story of Roberta Guaspari-Tzavaras (Meryl Streep), a violin teacher who single-handedly created a program to teach violin to inner city kids in East Harlem, New York.  The film follows her from the dubious inception of the program, which started as a substitute teaching job, through the ensuing 10 years where so many children wanted to be in the program that it had spread to three schools in the district and a lottery had to be held each year to limit the number of students.  The last part of the film is devoted to her fight to continue the program after the board of education killed its funding.  It culminates in a triumphant benefit concert supported by some of the greatest violinists in the world to raise private funds to save the program.This film celebrates the dogged determination and courage of one woman who proved that a single individual can make a difference.  Her life was not a pretty picture.  Her husband left her for one of her friends, turning her into an emotional basket case.  Music was her only solace and teaching was her gift.  Unfortunately, her lack of experience in the education system made her unqualified to get a position.  So on the recommendation of a friend she convinces an East Harlem principal to give her a chance as a substitute violin teacher.  She even supplies the violins.The story from there is an example of life often being more remarkable than fiction.  The results she achieved with these children were astounding.  My only criticism of the story was that it contained a little too much treatment of her personal life.  Almost her entire relationship with Brian (Aiden Quinn) could have been eliminated without hurting the story.  I know that director Wes Craven was trying to give us some character development on how tough her life was and how difficult a person she was, but it was superfluous and the digression only bogged the story down.  The real story here was about her and the kids.  He should have stuck to that.  Otherwise, Craven did a fabulous job of directing, delivering an emotional story with great power and effect.  I was quite impressed, especially given the fact that prior to this film, he was almost exclusively a one genre director (Horror.  Think &#145;Scream'). The acting by Meryl Streep was nothing short of brilliant.  I have read criticism of Streep's performance as too harsh, it seeming as if she didn't really LIKE the children.  In actuality her performance was dead solid perfect.  I was lucky enough to rent the Collector's Series DVD of this film which included a separate disk of the original documentary about the real Roberta Guaspari-Tzavaras and her students, including the actual concert at Carnegie Hall.  If you watch that documentary you will be in awe of how well Streep utterly nails her character.  We get to see the real Roberta teaching her students and she is like a drill sergeant barking orders, throwing kids out of practice for not having their violins, reproaching them angrily about plucking their strings while she is speaking, and generally tolerating no nonsense.  She is impatient with them and completely intolerant of anything but their best.The children who made comments about the real Roberta said things like, &#145;I wouldn't have the discipline I have if it weren't for Roberta.  That discipline not only helps me with the violin, but with everything else.'  Another child said, &#145;I have to pay attention to what I'm doing or Roberta will get mean.  But if I do good, she is pleased and that make me feel good.'  Yet another, &#145;I want to work really hard so Roberta will be proud of me.'  Clearly, these are not the comments of children who were being negatively affected by Roberta's no nonsense style.Streep said in the featurette included in the DVD that it is very difficult playing a real person because there is no leeway for artistic interpretation.  Translation  If she was to play Roberta Guaspari-Tzavaras, she had to become Roberta.  This she accomplished with stunning accuracy.  Streep captures not only Roberta's irascible demeanor, but the essence of her drive and passion for drawing the students very best.  Roberta is a complex and difficult character to play and Streep throws herself into the role, delivering a tour de force performance that very few actors have the range and depth to accomplish.This film is a must see for anyone who loves the arts and anyone who can appreciate a great actress giving a career performance.  I rated it a 9/10, subtracting a point for Craven's unnecessary digression into Roberta's private life.  That is, however, hardly a reason to miss this bravura performance and an inspiring story.

There actually isn't much of a plot-- we see pretty much the whole thing in the previews. But like the old time Hollywood stories about heros from art, music, science, etc., that I used to enjoy so much on television (I wasn't alive when that kind of movie was still being made), there are little moments of drama and tension throughout the story, and of course the big built-towards climax. I may not be describing it right, but that's how it felt to me-- an old hero movie.Meryl Streep is amazing, as always. For example, I really liked how they had the character be a bit of a grouch at the start of the movie, and how even after this became one of the many, small dramas that rose up throughout the movie-- she was still a bit of a grouch at the end of the movie. That felt more real to me than any other possible treatments of her flaw of grouchiness. People don't usually have it in them to make radical personality adjustments anyway. Also, we got to see that the grouchiness was heartfelt, and a perhaps clumsy attempt at expressing her dedication to the children she was responsible for teaching. The character then got a chance to see that some of the evident failings of her students (forgetting a violin, not standing straight, etc.) weren't signs of their ineptitude, laziness, or other negative traits. Rather, we and the teacher got to see that often the kids were actually adapting and coping with some pretty horrible circumstances in their world in the only ways they could, and doing a remarkably good job of it, given the fuller understanding.In that light, her grouchiness did taper off a bit; and as more and more students and parents began to appreciate what she really was striving for, the movie showed how cooperation and other forms of support were more forthcoming-- and thus the occasion for grouchiness was further reduced. But I really did like how Streep was able to show the character's personality was essentially the same, but expressed in a variety of different tenors and tones, perhaps, as we might expect over the course of a difficult but successful decade.This movie was heart warming, and appropriately so. (Many movie critics become crazed with rage at anything with any emotion-- but bleep them!) I don't think there was a hint of fakery or manipulation. The conclusion was reached with just enough miracle and just enough accident and just enough mathematical result of events and the natural course of things-- so that it all felt real.

They are drawn to these themes because they have such power, and when one individual connects with another, or a group, the results can be life-altering. So when we have a film that goes directly for the life-altering center, we can expect much.Streep could be up to this, if anyone could, at least from the delivery end.But when we end up with a film about mathematics, it completely misunderstands what math is (like `Good Will') or concentrate on arithmetic (as in the juvenile `Pi'). Only Greenaway connects with math, but his connection isn't intimate, blissful, instead abstract and distant.So most films focus on music because at least you have the performance. But then that is all we get, a filmed performance. Can't there ever be any artists involved? Can't they ever connect with the magic? Check out `Jackie and Hillary' for a taste of what I mean. This film is among the least musical of music films -- it is by and for people who know nothing about music.

Meryl Streep gave a great performance. And for her first major movie role, Gloria Estefan showed great talent in the area of acting.  I just love true story movies and I feel that this is the best one ever made.

My 12-year old niece and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie! She had just started taking up flute, and on the way out commented I wish I was taking violin instead!  I enjoyed pointing out the real-life musicians, such as Isaac Stern, and telling her about Carnegie Hall.  We were both thrilled with the outcome of Roberta Guaspari's fight against ever-present budget cuts.  As a music teacher, myself, I am familiar with these problems and can indeed relate.  While teaching in inner-city Hartford, CT I remember the trials of trying to teach over 1,000 students a week because the budget only allowed music once a week (once every three weeks if you were in Kindergarten). Meryl Streep did a wonderful job in the part of Roberta Guaspari (and I'm not a crazed fan of Meryl), and Angela Bassett did a wonderful job as the principal.  My only question is why did Gloria Estefan receive equal billing with these two?  Her part was minimal and added little (if anything) to the movie.  Was it only because of the song? Lastly, the children were absolutely wonderful.  They deserve as much praise, if not more, as anyone else. This was a wonderful, uplifting film, one that goes on my list of all-time greats with October Skies, and Mr Holland's Opus.

In reshaping its priorities to get America back on top as the world's leader in technological achievement, the nation's public schools slashed its arts program unmercifully.Among those subjects getting the ax were art, physical education, and music -- the very subjects, along with math, which comprised the Aristotle model curriculum.  While America improved its world standing in technology, character-building programs in the schools did indeed take a nosedive.Since the long-range value of music is difficult to measure quantitively, boards of education seized upon this void to mindlessly curtail the subject. The result has been a steady decline in performance, appreciation, and availability of art music during the last several decades.Music of the Heart attempts to tell a true-life story of one determined musician's efforts to bring quality musical performance to a school community that initially lacked appreciation for what she had to offer. In time, through her steadfastness, violin teacher Roberta Guaspari succeeded in keeping her program alive through private funding and community support.Meryl Streep portrays the teacher who experiences some wildy fluctuating trials and triumphs, thanks to Pamela Gray's uneven script and Wes Craver's equally uneven directing. While Streep appears genuinely committed to her role and acquits herself beautifully in her work with both the violin and educational presentation, she is only as successful as the setup will allow.We rather know the path this film is trodding; Sidney Poitier, Richard Dreyfuss and others have preceded Streep on this familiar journey.  For those who long for sentimentality and can ignore the cliche-ridden contrivances of the script, they may be assured of some dramatic catharsis by the end.  Others, though, might well beware.When Music of the Heart makes its nobler points, its a pleasure the need for concerted discipline to render achievement; the unique impact goal-attainment can have on people's sensibilities; and the beauty and inspiration that fine music can accomplish in elevating and transforming a community.It is this awareness and message that makes Music of the Heart an often engrossing statement.

This picture was the worst. Half the theatre did not return after the break halfway the film. I couldnt blame them, if this wasn't a true story there had been absolutely no need for the second half of the picture.

The worst collection of cliches I have seen in a long time. Not that I saw much. I left the theatre screaming after about 40 minutes in search of a stiff drink to soothe my nerves. Meryl Streep was awful as usual. How many hurt and tortured expressions can 1 person have? Aidan Quinn's talents were - as so often - totally wasted. And who told Gloria Estefan she could act? Trying to be polically correct this movie still enforces racial stereotypes. (Brave inexperienced lonely music teacher teaches underprivilegded kids violin in poor neighbourhood school). The kids weren't even cute! Just written in to suit the appalling script. Aaargh! Wes Craven really made me cringe for once. real horror this one!

All the acting is good (even the kids!), the music is beautiful and the story doesn't shy away from the kids painful home life.  One problem--Streep plays the teacher a little too harsh--she never seems to even LIKE the kids, so why is she teaching them? Also the kids are never really shown falling in love with violin playing. I started wondering why they were doing it--cause they were scared of Streep? Still, I enjoyed the movie but director Wes Craven should really stick to horror movies.  He's not too good at this type of movie.

From Sidney Poitier to Hollan's opus, and Gérard Depardieu did one too in France. I think Bette Davis has one in the 1940's. This is a Hollywood forumula movie  no surprise, no creativity. From the start, we know how it will end. Meryl Streep will win in many ways! And the little spark that makes some movies unforgettable? No need for that spark! We had a good star and a lot of cute children (who had problems, of course). I don't mean to say that this is a bad movie, I just mean to say that when I want to see a movie, I want to had real emotions, new ideas. Nothing's like that here. Just for fans of Meryl Streep.

She plays every role to perfection. Ever character has a different way of walking, inflection in their voice, movements, etc. You always believe you are watching a REAL person living their life in front of a camera.
