This film succeeds where all other drug films fail. It doesn't cram a message down your throat. It's not concerned with retreading the territory of Trainspotting or its clones. It has similar scenes, but the tone is completely different. Billy Crudup also delivers his real star-making performance (this came out before Almost Famous) as a young man whose name begins with an 'F' and ends with an 'uckhead'. His rambling narrative makes this film seem more like a friendly anecdote than a wittier-than-thou voice-over which always seems to do more to flatten out a film than to expand it. This film uses drugs as a vehicle to show how all of us need some sort of redemption, but we have to get it on our own terms.  "},{"Title":"Solid little gem!

Some truly great lines. When a nurse tells FH his girlfriend is comfortable now. He asks with total naivete Is she dead?I see that others here have problems with the title and the reference to  Jesus. Not me. Aren't all of us (and esecially the world's losers) just Christ figures waiting for redemption. It made me think of the line, the meek shall inherit the earth.

Heroin addict FH (ryhmes with Duck Bed) goes through a strange odyssey of loss and understanding his compassion. Brilliantly (and this is not an overstatement) acted by Billy Crudup (who should have been given an Oscar nod for his performance), he brings a complexity to his character that is missing from most actors around. Minor details are amazingly evident in his portrayel of FH, as the lovelorn, selfish, and sensitive junkie. Samantha Morton is outstanding as Michelle (FH's girlfriend), giving an intense and moody performance (which the viewer mourns the loss of half way through). The movie mixes moments of surreal madness, as the viewer is taken along existential scenes that could be described as hallucinogenic and funny. The scene where a gentleman (played by book author Denis Johnson) comes into a hospital with a hunting knife stuck in his eye is uncomfortably hillarious. Drugged up hospital attendant Georgie (Jack Black in a standout performance) proceeds to pop pills as he attempts to pull the knife out. But this is just one of the many great cameos that fills the screen. Denis Leary (looking a lot like Dennis Hopper in Easy Rider, Holly Hunter (playing a neurotic widow with a limp), and Dennis Hopper (looking amazingly like Dennis Hopper too) give great performances as well. Alison Maclean directs the film with great use of color and cinematography, but never crowding the actor's performance. Included as well, is a great music theme by Joe Henry, that incorporates the blending of psychedlic guitar and wurlitzer electric piano work. The rest of the soundtrack is great as well, with music by Wilco, Joe Tex, Neil Young, and Booker T & The MG's. This film was one of my favourite films of the year, and unfortunately didn't get as much notice as it deserved. Highly recommended!

It's impossible to imagine this film being produced in Hollywood. The subject matter is thorny, the form is innovative and most characters are ambiguous. In short, there's little here onto which a mass audience can grab. Yet, anyone choosing to pass this little film by will be missing something worthwhile.Jesus' Son, which takes its title from a Lou Reed song, expresses itself as a narrative memory. The film has the feel of random pages read out of someone's diary. It opens with a voice-over and we are immediately aware of an eccentric approach the narrator has jumped the gun and needs to start over again. This sort of starting and re-starting may seem an affectation derived from the French 'new wave,' but it is handled so effectively that it succeeds in pulling the viewer into the film. Once officially on track, Jesus' Son moves from scene to scene with a method that seems wholly controlled by this main character/narrator, a young man known simply as F'head. We're never sure if he deserves this unflattering name, since his intentions are not always clear. F'head just seems to move through life, going where circumstances take him. Along the route, a wide variety of character types are encountered. Most leave F'head with something, and a few take something from him. For individuals who are roughly contemporary with the characters in this film, there is much here that rings true. The time period-early 1970s-was a strange, directionless time for many in their early twenties. In fact, the film almost makes an unintentional case for the rampant drug abuse of the time for so many, there was nothing else to do. But the intention of Jesus' Son is not to excuse drug abuse, nor is to preach against it. Rather, the movie takes its hero on a rambling journey through the undersides and back alleys of life so that he may discover a single reason for staying alive. F'head seems a variant of the wise fool character, bringing about change in the lives of those he meets, yet seemingly unable to evaluate any of the events or relationships in his own life. Some viewers may see the hero guided by a higher power, of which he is himself unaware. While the film's haphazard structure may be annoying to some, it admirably suits the time period and life-styles of the characters. There is a seeming discrepancy between several scenes. Some have a realistic, semi-documentary feel (when F'head first encounters Michelle), while others appear to be drawn from some bizarre cable-TV sitcom (the entire hospital orderly sequence, for instance). As in many independent films of recent years, there is much humor mixed with stark drama. The director, Alison Maclean, keeps a firm grip, maneuvering between wide-ranging emotional states. In the end, one is left with the feeling of having really experienced something. This is due not only to Maclean, but to the very fine cast. Not surprisingly, Jesus' Son is dependent for its success on the portrayal of its central character. Billy Crudup, an actor who could easily be dismissed as a pretty boy, brings an almost palpable reality to every scene. He exhibits a total identification with the character and is able to project perfectly the inherent ambiguity that drives the entire story. Is F-Head putting everyone on? There are flashes of nearly poetic brilliance in his dialogue, mixed with befuddled inanity. He seems to live around his world, rather than within it; observing, but not always participating. Although one might wonder how someone with his lifestyle could have such perfect teeth, F'head as played by Crudup, is a beautiful, confused and confusing angel.Other cast members are memorable as well. Samantha Morton, who made a huge impression in Woody Allen's Sweet and Lowdown, embodies the equally ambiguous persona of Michelle, who loves F'head, yet seeks to destroy herself. Dennis Leary effectively creates a man annihilated by his own life. The growing number of Jack Black fans will probably enjoy his over-the-top characterization, but to this viewer his George seems vaguely disturbing and threatening. Holly Hunter is the kind of performer who can bring a lot to a film with just a few lines. She plays a lovely crippled woman here with dignity and humor. Also excellent in their brief appearances are an understated Dennis Hopper and the vigorous Will Patton.Typical of many period films dealing with young people , the soundtrack of Jesus' Son is loaded with contemporary popular songs. But the choices here seem carefully made. There is new material as well a fine main theme written by Bob Dylan and the closing credits are supported by an absolutely superb song with a Woody Guthrie lyric, set to music and performed by Wilco.

My initial viewing was a little underwhelmed- being a fan of Johnson's book I had worked this up to impossible heights in my mind. However, on a second viewing I enjoyed the film more- the nouvelle-vague via Scorsese editing & structure seemed much better 2nd time around.The film is closest to 'Drugstore Cowboy'- though parts such as the split-screen or the digital editing as F***head takes pills in the Emergency Room could have come from 'Requiem for a Dream'. The source stories have been extended and made more cohesive- as with the adaptation of Hubert Selby Jr's 'Last Exit to Brooklyn' by Uli Edel.The film is wonderfully shot- a great scene is the drive-in/cemetery that plays 'Carnival of Souls' (though I thought I saw Samantha Morton caught in an almost Anton 'Depeche Mode' Corbijin style!); imagine 'Zabriskie Point' without the metaphysical masturbation...The acting is uniformly great- Crudup & Morton are fantastic leads, while Denis Leary, Greg Germann, Holly Hunter are among the excellent supports. The short Dennis Hopper shaving scene is one of the greatest pieces of cinema I have seen in recent years; while Jack Black almost steals the film with his amusing listen to my shoes. And Denis Johnson is great as hunting knife in eye guy. Oh and Will Patton pops up as 'John Smith'- still he was in 'The Postman', so not quite yet forgiven.The soundtrack (chosen by Johnson) is great- Neil Young's 'Cowgirl in the Sand', Wilco's 'Airline to Heaven' & 'She's a Jar', 'Hang on Sloopy' and the great score. The highlight is Morton's gyrating dance to 'Oh Sweet Pea'- almost as great as that dance scene ripped off for 'Pulp Fiction' from Godard's 'Bande a Part'.Only quibble is- where was 'Heroin' by The Velvet Underground?'Jesus' Son' is a touching, funny, and tender film that deserves to find an audience. There are too many great moments here- Hunter's arm waving in the air, Beverly Home, the Amish, the laundry scene, the ER scene, the rabbits roadtrip etc. Terribly depressing that mediocrity like 'Human Traffic' & 'Trainspotting' finds an audience here- but a film like this isn't allowed to (except at a few arthouse cinemas). Pity- and Alison MacLean's debut 'Crush' is also excellent; here's to possible adaptations of Denis Johnson's 'Already Dead' & 'The Name of the World'- by David Lynch and Paul Schrader respectively (hopefully)...Check out Johnson's books- as this film's use of voiceover stems right from them.

Samantha Morton has incredible chemistry with Crudup who is fascinating to keep watching even as his character is a passive naif whom we really don't learn anything about. My biggest complaint is that the cameos by recognizable and/or famous actors (Denis Leary, Jack Black of High Fidelity, Holly Hunter, Dennis Hopper) make the source material of short stories--which I assume are where the chapter headings come from-- too obvious; I would have preferred intriguing character actors or complete unknowns.This is one of those little movies where you see a filmmaker in love with her tools of the medium, because it is both literate and explores the story visually, with judicious use of fantasies and hallucinations.The Joe Henry musical score is wonderful, and the soundtrack selection of alt.country, including several Wilco songs, and offbeat rock and r & b classics are also commentaries on the action (amusingly the only Henry song used comes in over the radio that an annoyed Crudup turns off in order to hear the dialog).(originally written 6/24/2000) "},{"Title":"Searching for Meaning","Date":"19 August 2001","Score":"9 out of 12 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  Searching for Meaning could be the title of the movie as well as of the reactions of many people who didn't want to see below the mixed-up surface of the film.

We all want to find our place in a strange world where we have to consider the answers to the questions Why did God make us? and Why did God make us the way we are?The solution to the riddles seems to be connecting with all our fellow riddlers, realizing that we'll understand someday what it all means.This is a disturbing, funny, sad film -- not for everybody, but an interesting experience for people who don't mind thinking about what is being shown on the screen.

It's not heavy at all. True, the subject is about the drug scene in the '70's, but how can anything be heavy with Jack Black in it? (Yes, the one who delivered a surprisingly impressive singing at the finale of John Cusack's passion High Fidelity 2000). JESUS' SON is neither your usual Hollywood glamorized drug movie.I was skeptical when I first heard about this film in Dec. '99 -- another one on drugs. Then when the trailer started, it grew on me. The image of framing an arc of a wreath above Crudup's head was the crowning influence that I must see this movie. In any case, Billy Crudup and Samantha Morton are quite an intense pairing.The whole film seems like it's on it's own trip (pun intended). Crudup is FH, a rather lovable character. He is actually a shy person. Now and then he emits a sense of humor and it comes across so innocently -- you just can't blame him. He's trying to do right. Billy Crudup carried the picture from beginning to end. We see him and hear him narrating. The words uttered are eloquent. Crudup's clear enunciation adds to the fluidity of the text that we're hearing throughout the film. Watching this film is rather like playing an album, you can go back and forth just by lifting the turntable needle. The vignettes are different tracks on the road trip with Jack Black and the rabbits, and dealing with the knife in the head emergency case during a hospital shift (with Jack Black contributing his comic rhythm and delivering his lines equally fun to hear); shaving Dennis Hopper and interviewing him at the same time; interactions with Holly Hunter before and after AA meetings; staff routines at the senior home in Phoenix; repeatedly watching the Amish couple through the window glass; going to Denis Leary's house and the aftermath; of course, the interludes and episodes with Samantha Morton as Michelle. Humor is ever present. Bravo to the script by three screenplay writers, based on Denis Johnson's short stories, and kudos to director Alison Mclean. She directed a film with such clarity and simple strokes. Billy Crudup would be the reason to see this film if not anything else, he exudes a halo of light about him -- his angelic face, even with his coy whiskers, still has a certain innocence about him, and according to FH, he does have ominous feelings in him of what to come. Jesus' son, he very well is. Enjoy this film, it's an excellent effort and production all round, including the soundtrack music and songs of the 70's.Don't miss Without Limits 1998, another Billy Crudup must-see, if you haven't yet.

He takes drugs, only lives because his girlfriend saves his life, yet he lets her die in the same circumstance. He sees the sacred heart of Jesus on a man who tells him to go away. But ultimately he finds his own place in the world and sees beauty where others can't.This is an art-house movie, and the reason that art house movies don't turn up in mainstream cinemas is because they have limited appeal.

Finally it came up on my Netflix streaming list. I had high hopes after reading the review by the critic Ebert, who I find usually helpful, and also the relatively high IMDb rating. But sadly when it was all over I found it to be not much of a satisfying movie at all.I like Billy Crudup, he is a good actor. Here he plays FH (short for F***-Head), and the moniker fits because as good as his intentions mostly are, he just has a knack for messing things up. He seems sincere, but almost a simpleton, and especially when we see him do some of the things he does. Like the time he hears a woman singing while in the shower, he goes into the home and lies down on the bed to listen to her. Until the husband comes in. Like, who would actually do something like that?The other key character is Samantha Morton as Michelle and when FH meets her she is already an addict. Her addiction pulls him in too and, while they genuinely seem to care for each other, you can't really care for another person when you are addicted to drugs and wonder how you will support your habit.The film has quite a number of other well-known actors, like Dennis Leary, Dennis Hopper, Jack Black, Holly Hunter, but mostly in brief parts. It is puzzling why the title is what it is. There are many funny, or just interesting, moments in the film but for me it did not add up to a worthwhile movie.

The short story origins go a long way to explaining the movie's patchy feel. Billy Crudup is christened FH (F*** Head) by his mates because he fouls up everything and everyone he comes across. The common link in most of FH's otherwise random misadventures is Michelle (Samantha Morton), a junkie he meets at a party and falls in love with. It's a bare thread to hang the film on, but Morton manages to centre things for a while. She gives the film's liveliest performance, making Michelle a lot more interesting than FH and the other eccentrics he meets (played by the likes of Denis Leary, Dennis Hopper and Holly Hunter in cameo roles).Drug taking is not a spectator sport, and watching the semi-dazed FH wander wintry America in the early 1970s quickly becomes tiresome. We've seen this sort of material too often in independent American features for it to be fresh, and Maclean's fluid direction and ability with actors cannot disguise the episodic nature of the material. FH veers from boring to downright unlikeable, and I didn't care much about him or his potential redemption. Not helping was my failure to connect with the grotesque humour.

The film, an adaptation of Denis Johnson's book of short stories, has been fairly well realized by director Alison Maclean (who has a vivid eye for detail); unfortunately, the protagonist isn't really a character at all, and this isn't entirely Crudup's fault. He hasn't been conceived as anything but a walking foul up, one with fabricated answers and--in his narration--'deep thoughts' soaked in the smugness of an elevated consciousness.

The star of Jesus' Son is Billy Crudup, along with the relatively unknown Samantha Morton. But also on board is Holly Hunter, Will Patton, Dennis Hopper, and Denis Leary in small roles. These films' defining stamp is that they are told in an intentionally haphazard manner. Put simply, this makes a film that's difficult to watch. Both films are based on novels (I've read neither) and I can safely say this storytelling style befits the page more than it does the screen. It's supposed to make the experience more challenging for the audience, leaving them to try and piece this collection of strange occurrences into something that means anything. Let's just say I don't prefer this type of movie-going experience. I didn't find anything particularly great about this film, nor did I find anything to be at all endearing.

He hitches a ride with a family, all the while knowing a car accident will kill most of them. He rescues the infant member of the family, and it strangely coincides with the fact that his girlfriend Michelle (Samantha Morton) had an abortion around that same time. FH lives through the horrible suicide of Michelle somehow, and begins to try to get away from drugs and have a life that makes sense.

A quasi blend of `Drugstore Cowboy' and `My Own Private Idaho' with a bent perspective of a drug-fueled world bleakly attempting to clean itself for a better good.  A bit too much in spurts but has its distinct charm largely thanks to the acting and memorable black out sequences (FYI that's author Johnson as an emergency room patient with a hunting knife jutting from his eye).

In Jesus' Son, he plays a low-life, clueless, heroin addict named Fuckhead. I don't think you'll see Leonardo, Tom, or any of the other young, A-list actors coming close to roles like this. The film is placed in the early 1970s and follows Crudup through a few years of his heroin-addled life. Narrated by Fuckhead, he chronicles his own life from his introduction to heroin, through his attempts to quit. The narrative moves backwards and forwards in time, almost as if Fuckhead is remembering something out of sequence which might interest the viewer. Definitely not for everyone, but in my opinion is a very interesting movie.

Its only saving graces are the wonderful, vomit-colored cinematography, the always amusing Jack Black and the always enthralling Dennis Hopper, who could give Mr. Crudup some lessons in movie acting stillness.The myth of the innocent junkie is as tiresome and unrealistic as the myth of the hooker with the heart of gold.

The movie seems vaporous around the edges, like the snowbound compositions of Robert Altman's QUINTET, and the images have a yellowy, rotten-Polaroid quality that seems based on Nan Goldin's portraits of the dispossessed.Based on Denis Johnson's novel, the movie is early John Irving meets DRUGSTORE COWBOY. FH (Billy Crudup), the zero hero, loves his partner in heroin addiction (Samantha Morton), but somehow keeps sidestepping happiness through a series of dropped balls--which involve a squashed handful of baby rabbits pulled from their dead mommy's guts, an ER patient with a knife in his eye, and (most painfully) a Lou Gehrig's patient abandoned by his wife. The worldview on display here was better articulated on the back bumper of a pick-up truck Life's a Bitch and Then You Die. The epiphanies are lame after the joky horrors the movie stockpiles. And as FH, Billy Crudup has the looks of a movie star, and the stick-to-itiveness of an actor, but lacks the personality or the truthfulness to suffice as either one. He is, to put it harshly, no Matt Dillon. And for all Maclean's evident talent, and despite the lovely pass-through performances of Will Patton, Holly Hunter, Dennis Hopper and others, this movie plays like uncharming, creep-inducing Gus Van Sant the insistence on Letterman-style ironic snickering at back-breaking tragedy comes to seem slightly nuts.

Director Alison Maclean has some lovely and disturbing visuals here, in particular a scene where two junkies wander off a highway and into a field that could alternately be a graveyard or a drive-in movie.  The script, based on a novel, stretches out as a series of vignettes surrounding the travels of lovable junkie known only as F*ckhead (Billy Crudup, in a performance that will dethrone DiCrappio as The Next Big Thing) whose first-person narrations offers some almost profound, ideot-savant wisdom.A strong supporting cast includes Samantha Morton as F*ckhead's wild/tragic junkie girlfriend (Her scenes with Crudup play like Sid and Nancy with a little more heart), Denis Leary in his best role yet as a gruff, shaky-handed Cowboy Junkie, Dennis Hopper as a weary recovering addict, Greg Germann (from Ally McBeal)as a hopelessly limited doctor, and Holly Hunter, who in a small part rises above the tongue-in-cheek camp surrounding her character's tragic story.  And the true stand-out is Jack Black, the hefty young character actor who gets the most laughs as a drugged-out hospital orderly.  His scenes in the hospital with Crudup are some of the most frightening, funny and bizarre scenes to appear on film so far this year.

Although Crudup is cast seemingly at random with Samantha Morton, who plays Michelle the catalysts for much of Fuck Head's evolution; their performances together are gritty and riveting.This is a completely original telling of the over used genre of how a man from the 1970's turns from drug addiction and petty crime to a life redeemed by a discovery of compassion. With such a story, there are scenes of absurdity and excessiveness, during which I found myself about to write-off the rest of the movie until I realized that each spectacle of a scene came with a sudden blunt crash back to a harsh reality. This allows us as viewers to experience some of the roller-coaster ride the characters go through without the side affects usually associated with Heroin.Furthermore, this movie is splattered with brilliant cameos from Dennis Hopper, Will Patton, and two of my favorites come from Jack Black and Denis Leary.I suggest you turn the lights off, sit down, crank the volume, and watch this movie with a stiff drink; you won't be disappointed.

I frequently found my interest in the narrative and the characters waning, with particular memorable scenes that made it worthwhile to keep a watch. The uniqueness of the main character's perspective is presented in scenes with a mixture of surrealism at times (along with his own narrative that he can't quite remember). This could have made for an interesting production, but at times I just found it irritating. Maybe I've just seen too many loser druggie films and the mostly pointless lives they portray to empathize with these people and their situations, in contrast to the real-life addicts I have known. The film does have its own redemptive conclusion, however, and deserves credit for being more realistic in the way it is presented than we might have anticipated. In fact, the film's clever title may just have a double meaning, with reference to the Velvet Underground song Heroin and a semi-spiritual theme all in one; we're all God's children. Just having seen Crudup in Almost Famous, a film made around the same time from a similar period, may have typed him for me in this kind of role, although he was a far more succesful character in that far better film.

Jesus' Son instead patches together anecdotal episodes of our amiably inept non-hero's life and acquaintances to give us a picture of a very human, very well-meaning but disconnected and directionless young man. Rather than eagerly awaiting the conclusion of the story, I often found myself mourning the brevity of many of the little segments, which are no less enjoyable alone than as part of a larger narrative.This film needs to be seen for the hospital scene alone. Without spoiling anything, Alison Maclean has assembled a beautifully disjointed array of characters - kudos has and will continue to be given for the deliciously disastrous Jack Black, who both steals the show and plays off Crudup magnificently, but the part of the reception nurse (played by Yvette Mercedes) is also brief but brilliant and deserves a mention.The acting makes this film - it's clever and human and warm, but without the necessary cast, its meandering structure may not have stood up to scrutiny. The quietly terrifying Dundun, the explosive Michelle, Denis Leary and Dennis Hopper's respective turns - all do fine credit to it.Crudup is wonderful; in his hands, the film skirts widely around the clichéd Drugs Are Bad, Mmkay ground of too many films (for every great film of that ilk - Requiem for a Dream, Basketball Diaries - there are many awful ones), and he plays FH subtly and remarkably as a essentially optimistic and wide-eyed fella whose naivety, lack of direction and dubious associations get him into frequent trouble. The structure of his narration is great in its naturalism, starting to tell one anecdote before remembering he forgot to explain something previous - and it adds great depths to his character. One can imagine FH having been the kid at school with Must try harder written in red across every assignment.Jesus' Son seems to have divided opinion across the board. It's certainly not for everyone but to my mind, it's one of the best and most unusual films of recent years. Ultimately, if you're prepared to sit and watch something real, terrifically funny, occasionally disorganised, and all too human - a film that eschews neat edges, Hollywood trimming and concise plot structures for a fantastically life-sized character study of someone many of us will recognise in ourselves - then I doubt you'll be disappointed.

Johnson, the author, has a (rather gruesome) cameo appearance and was the musical consultant, so one can guess that he approved of the film. And well he should much of Billy Crudup's voiceover narration comes straight from the pages of the book, and works beautifully. The film is not afraid to go beyond reality and into a drug-addled point of view. Crudup is terrific, as are Samantha Morton and Holly Hunter (in a small role--Dennis Hopper also has a cameo, and Jack Black once again nearly steals the show). Unlike most movies populated by addicts, you don't tire of these losers and want to share in a redemption that is far from a Hollywood ending.

Jesus' Son, like Trainspotting and Drugstore Cowboy, is yet another whimsical drug movie imbued with black comedy, surrealism, (two of my favorite things) and a hapless addict musing about life. It has it moments of tragedy, symbolism, bumbling humor, and poignancy, but, for all its existential moments, it still manages to come up being shallow, especially in the wake of better films about addiction.The infuriating thing is that it plays like a sentimental Forrest Gump of drug culture. Through a series of vignettes, we follow different moments in the life of F***head, a wide eyed innocent, druggie, who rambles little insights about life, and despite causing misfortune, stumbles along with little regard for his actions. His coming into sobriety, near the end, seems to just be happenstance, and somehow, we are meant to show some kind of affection towards him.  He falls into becoming an addict and just as easily falls out of it, still remaining pure of heart. It's this sickening casual attitude about addiction and F***head's nature that ruins the film; that he doesn't learn from his misfortune, deaths around him, but he is still some great, almost mythic, figure cluelessly touching other peoples lives.  If you didn't buy into a millionaire simpleton (Gump), then you shouldn't buy into the thoughtful, forever innocent addict.Crudup is good, he lives and walks in the skin of F***head, but despite some greasy hair, unflattering makeup, and coy facial expressions, he's still so damn handsome he doesn't remind me of any addict I've seen or known. Samantha Morton is, yet again, note for note perfect as his girlfriend, who introduces him to heroin. Dennis Leary, Dennis Hopper, and Holly Hunter also show up, but none of their characters are in the film long enough to be heavily defined. In other words, they are good, but they remain just Dennis Hopper, Dennis Leary, and Holly Hunter, not anyone else- one of my gripes, do not cast major actors in small roles. Jack Black is fantastic, worth a viewing for the Tenacious One alone. But, ultimately the film is empty despite the good performances.

It's not often I find films poetic, but in this case, I found Jesus' Son to be quite lyrical. It's not necessarily a cautionary tale, it doesn't spit any messages in your face. It's merely a depiction of a certain period in someone's life, a picture so beautifully and non-judgmentally rendered, it reminded me of well-written poetry in texture and feeling. The pacing was slow, but not belabored. More American films should be like this. It's been said before, but the States could stand to take a lesson from European cinema.Crudup's character, F$@#head, is multi-layered, avoiding being pigeonholed as just a junkie, or an over-sensitive individual, or a young man just down on his luck. We feel bad for him, but we don't pity him; he's slow-witted, but smart enough to pull himself out of the trenches of self-abuse when maturity calls upon him to do so. He's an everyman, albeit with a golden heart, guilty of nothing more than some bad choices in tough circumstances. Who can't identify with that? I've been trailing his career since I first saw him in 'Inventing the Abbotts,' and while he hasn't produced a body of work comparable to other character actors I so admire, I look forward to seeing his career ascend. Ditto Samantha Morton. I loved her performance in 'Sweet and Lowdown,' thought it was quite affecting, and her role here, as Michelle, is no less astonishing in its emotional complexity; she's got a big but fragile heart, finally collapsing under the weight of her bond to F#$@head. My sense is that her career will resemble Emily Watson's, both in diversity of characters and, if there's any justice, longevity.If you're looking for a stylistic, gracefully acted drama about self-renewal, this one's for you.

But from its opening scene, JESUS' SON establishes itself as something quite worth watching.  Despite the use of main-character-as-narrator, which can be a real sticking point, the film's writing and Billy Crudup's tremendous acting ability propel every scene into something charming and full, almost overflowing with ideas.  In the course of this movie's average length, FH (in case you haven't seen the film, F and H are the initials of Crudup's character's unpleasant sobriquet) runs in with a bizarre and completely original group of characters who are all like him in some way his manic junkie girlfriend (Morton), a down-and-out scumbag with a hammer (Leary), a perennial widow (Hunter), a Mennonite couple, a drug-addled orderly (Black), a crusty old con (Hopper).  However, these characters are not token or caricatured, but fully formed people who live in FH's bizarre reality and all connect with his desperate longing for escape or meaning in one way or another.  Much like Bruno Dumont's recent films LA VIE DE JESUS (hmm) and HUMANITE, JESUS' SON explores life in a particularly unforgiving world (in this case, 1970's Chicago, in Dumont's, bleak pastoral France) and claws for some sort of beauty therein.  Unlike Dumont's films, FH seems to find that beauty amongst people whom he can relate with and help.  The two sides to this film can be seen in a span where FH works as an orderly, and, with the frantically comic Jack Black, steals pills to make it through the long graveyard shift.  After a grisly scene involving the removal of a hunting knife from a man's eye, the two wander into the countryside, and, drug-addled and playing off one another (like the characters in Thompson's FEAR AND LOATHING. . .), marvel at the ghostly wonders of the night.  These scenes are priceless examples of writing and imagination that, in terms of sheer delight, probably eclipse anything to come out of recent Hollywood. In the end, the true glory of this film is to find compassion where our conceptions of characters would tell us otherwise.  The characters are not spat upon in their depiction; everything they do is earnest and according to their human value.  The viewer constantly waits for something truly horrible to occur (and this is, often, what the film portends), but instead we can find only light.  The movie has weak points, but they are few.  All in all, this is a triumph of acting and writing, and the direction sparkles at times.  The film fails to provide a coherent theme to speak of, but its disjointed pieces somehow fit together to form a wondrous whole that is never short on surprises or pure humanity.

His name refers to the way everything he touches goes horrendously wrong, but what saved this movie for me from being too depressing was the humour and pathos in Crudup's performance which almost made me like the messed up character he plays. His journey is shown in a series of separate segments, staying reasonably close to the style of the acclaimed short stories by Denis Johnson on which the movie is based.  FH  has an on-off liaison with Michelle, powerfully played by Samantha Morton who was so impressive in the badly under-rated  This is the Sea  and in Jesus' Son is once again utterly convincing.A strong cast includes cameo appearances from Will Paton, Dennis Hopper and most notably Holly Hunter who is mesmerising in a brief appearance towards the end of the film as a woman who has suffered from dreadful things which keep happening to her husbands.By this stage I had become a litle bored with the succession of losers and  gory incidents - a guy with a knife in his eye being treated in the emergency room for instance - but Hunter's role together with the overall strength of Crudup's acting re-ignited the final section of this interesting movie.At the end  FH  does find some kind of redemption and his surprise at this situation is almost a happy ending. I was surprised too how much of an impression the movie made on me afterwards with little incidents and lines of dialogue making me want to see it again. So Jesus'Son, although not for the faint-hearted, is definitely worth checking out - especially for Billy Crudup's perfomance - and I am certain that Alison Maclean is set to be a major directorial talent in the years ahead.(Jesus' Son shown at the London Film Festival, November 06, 1999) "},{"Title":"Nice effort, but a serious sense of deja-vu","Date":"10 June 2008","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" Jesus' Son is a decently made independent film whose heart is in the right place.

Its nice to see a movie which doesn't beat you over the head with a simplistic drugs are bad moral (such as the incredibly overrated Requiem For a Dream did), but the material in Jesus' Son is far too slight to have any lasting effect.

Billy Crudup takes a bland character and does his best with him. Hes likable enough in the main role. Even better is the supporting cast. Samantha Morton, Dennis Hopper, Denis Leary, and Jack Black all give surprisingly poignant performances. The direction by Alison Maclean takes the rather uninteresting material and keeps it moving at a quick pace, quick enough to make you not realize the weightlessness of the film until its over. If only the screenplay (credited to three different writers!) had some more effort put into it, Jesus' Son could've been something special.

Just as poor FH only learned that Michelle has written a note asking to be saved if he loved her--- too late.I would not want, nor do I have the expertise, to analyze this film based on cinematic criteria. The film started with an idea, someone had something to say, each participant-- director, actor, editor, passed that idea along, cleanly and precisely. Every cinematic technique served this advancement of the expression The metaphysical surreal elements didn't seem like an affectation, but worked to express the idea.Emblematic of the tone was after the abortion when FH asked, what did they stick up you. Michelle's reaction. Her scream. She could have handled the intrusion into her body, the loss of a living being that could have been her child, but the coldness, the rejection of her beloved, was a cause for anguish, expressed perfectly in a primordial cry.And certain lines, as throwaways easy missed, were profound.

Diverse in color and imagery as well as in the kinds of characters you will see this movie is an interesting change from most coming-of-age and drug movies you will see.But let me tell you how this is a disappointing film. This actually bothers me the most. The plot seems to progress as if something pivotal is going to happen and you expect to see a resolution and a change in this man. I don't think this is portrayed well at all. With the deceiving title like Jesus' Son, this movie is very simplistic and shallow in its spiritual content. There are some references to Christianity and Jesus but thats about it. You do not see this man change or accept Jesus. There is nothing like that. What you are presented with is a very man-centered idea that its good to be a good guy and to be compassionate to people and not do drugs.But as if the lack of any substantial Christian content were not enough, I think this movie glamorizes sex and drugs instead of emphasizing their vanity. Even in the end, when you think that maybe he is changing there is no indication of any true Christian character in him. Even when you feel like the main character may be feeling compassion and love towards the wretched people he encounters he doesn't show it in any way.So, be warned, this is not a Christian movie, nor is it a good anti-drug film. Its a very cinematically pleasing noir-style indie film that simply tells you that people should be nice. It is sad that there are very few real Christian movies out there.

Unless you are into stuff like this, watch the movie, I know you'll like it, because personally I don't.

Yes, as others have noted, its fun to count the metaphors and allusions to religion. Ok, not really fun, but at least it gives you something to do until the movie ends. Apparently, without a written program you'll miss most of the insider knowledge that is the only thing that might make this interesting. Want to watch a movie about drugs? Watch Sid and Nancy. Watching them shoot up was so fascinating, I couldn't take my eyes away. Watching FH's girlfriend do it gave me the same reaction it seemed to give him So what.

The quiet desperation of the Mennonites in this film I'd like to have known more about. Or even the fat nurse who teaches FH to touch the nursing home patients. What kind of insight can come from a drugged stupor? And how does FH know as much as he does about philosophy? Show him with a book in his hand once in awhile. I can just see my high school students admiring him. Only THEY are naive enough to believe a druggie can be worth watching for two hours. But they also think they can relate to Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. You know, the one with Johnny Depp. "},{"Title":"It sucks!!","Date":"7 August 2001","Score":"2 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  I saw this on HBO and was glad that I didn't rent or see this piece of crap in a movie theater. It sounded so good, but it sucked!! The general story idea was good but poorly executed with the most stupid dialogue and subplots! I stopped watching it midway through because it was so bad. The only good thing was the acting. Didn't see one bad performance, and Samantha Morton was outstanding. Too bad they didn't have a good movie to compliment them.

Jesus' Son (a misnomer), is a bunch of meaningless vignettes sort of strung together into a kind of wandering odyssey of a guy who's wide-eyed and stupid (Crudup). The problem with this non-story is it's not compelling nor evocative nor poignant nor interesting nor educational nor prosaic nor entertaining nor...etc. It's, well, just plain dumb.I was deluded by some good reviews (Ebert and others) and watched waiting for something interesting to happen. Unfortunately, nothing interesting did happen. No big climax, no great ending, no apocalypse, no epiphany, no nothing, nada..zip. Just dumb boredom heaped upon more dumb boredom. Good fodder for dilettantes but not recommended for anyone else.

The story - or lack thereof - is poorly written and just sort of wanders from one scene to the next, with no real meaningful sequence. The narrator is a burnout so, Surprise!, the story is told nonsequentially with him backtracking to fill in holes and blah blah blah. I'm getting so sick of the Post-Pulp Fiction Rip-offathon. Tarantino does it well, Fernando Meirelles did it well in City of God, but this is just another quasi-hip movie that has no plot and follows down-and-burntout fools that have no real insight on anything (even drug use) with a tired message. So there's another person out there that thinks drug addiction takes a devastating toll on an individual's life. What an effing surprise. He didn't even get his point across that well. The friend I watched it with didn't even think it had a message and thought argued with me (though he quickly gave up) that this movie wasn't showing the terrible toll heroin addiction took on FH's life. This movie had little to no effect on me, even though I did catch the message- I wanted to do drugs way worse after watching this movie than I did after watching Requiem for a Dream, Trainspotting, or Basketball Diaries. Mainly because I was bored out of my mind. This movie uses cheap tricks to make you think you're feeling something. I didn't care much for the characters, but I wouldn't wish some of this stuff on my worst enemy. Any abortion scene or a scene in an old-folks home full of deformed, disabled, and forgotten people is going to make your insides twinge no matter how much (or little) you care about the characters. Sorry dudes, this movie sucks. Anyone who says otherwise is probably one of these people that tells you about a drug reference in a movie before they tell you anything else. Most Potheads and drug-users (and I use these terms with affection because I am of both persuasions) like any movie with any sort of drug reference- and if all you're looking for is drugs on screen than I guess you should watch this movie. Sum it up Watch Requiem instead. Very similar MO's but Requiem was much more impressive. PS- It would be unfair of me not to mention how funny Jack Black is in this movie. The movie sucks, but he sure is funny in it.

I waited and waited for sometheme or persuasive theory to emerge. Neither happened. I saw some nicescenes here and there, but saw no cohesive plot that could be called unified.  There was a lot of potential here, but no point at all. It's a shame really.Performances were great, and the production value was there. But there'sactually no point to the story. I can't imagine what those actors were thinking  when they agreed to do this because this film could never have had anycommercial potential whatsoever.

Possibly it's the losers themselves, a potentially large if unsung & untrumpeted demographic; or it could be for the great hard-working law-abiding shop-to-help-the-economy consumer middle class which needs to feel that there is really is some flip-side kind of bandit/outlaw culture out there whose lives make all their own compulsive security meaningful. It could be a combination of both.In any case it's the worst kind of self-delusional garbage.

He seems to go from one tragedy to the next in this slice-of-(druggie)life drama. All of the reflections on the characters seem superficial at best. One doesn't really feel for any of them. Sure, the film wants you to relate to F.H., yet it fails on this level. Good films based on literature should make you want to run to your local bookstore to feed your mind with more, this film fails on this level too. Yet there are bright spots in the film, both Dennis Leary as well as Jack Black are excellent here. And Dennis Hopper is ok enough in his elongated cameo.My Grade C-DVD Extras theatrical trailer "},{"Title":"very disappointing","Date":"6 April 2003","Score":"2 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  Don't be fooled by the reviews.

So we rented it, and watched it. It is a complete waste of time. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it impressed upon my son how drugs waste your life. But he already knew that. I think he thought this movie would be comedic, similarly with Napolean Dynamite, but there is nothing comedic about this movie. And the characters are so completely worthless that you never develop an affinity for any of them -- you really don't care what happens to them. They are trashy people, living trashy lives, and this movie about them is nothing but trash. "},{"Title":"Oh My God! This One Was A Sin!","Date":"1 May 2001","Score":"3 out of 14 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  `Oh Christ!' What I thought was going to be a thought-provoking character study type film turned out to be a Joshua backstabbing piece of worthless art that should have been crucified during postproduction. Sorry! My Lord! I know I am being harsh. This movie did have potential. Its theme of a young man's adventure to the world of drug addiction, geriatric centers, hamish singers, deranged hospital orderlies, and the weirdest type of home remodeling that there is could have been something to yell `Halleluyas' about. However, the filmmakers sinned their cinematic art into making a movie that was way too abstract for us to enjoy. However, I do have to kneel down and bow my head to the actors- Billy Crudup, Jack Black, Holly Hunter, Dennis Hopper, Denis Leary, and Samantha Morton. But for the grace of god! Next time hand them a script that they enjoy! If you are looking for cinematic utopia, just remember that `Jesus' Son' is not the one. ** Needs Improvement  "}]
