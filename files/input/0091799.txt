Things are going fine until Norman falls in love with a fallen nun (Diana Scarwid), takes in a greedy drifter (Jeff Fahey), a nosy reporter (Roberta Maxwell) sticks her nose where it doesn't belong and a series of murders begins once again.my thoughts Although not as great a sequel as PSYCHO II, this is still a good sequel. With Anthony Perkins directing himself, you can expect a good addition to the PSYCHO series.Now, Norman Bates is dealing with a lot. He's falling in love, a reporter is poking around, and a new employee is close to discovering his secret. The mystery and atmosphere of the first two are still here but it's 1986, the middle of the 80's slasher era. More sex and violence have been added.We have gorier kills and even Juliette Cummins (FRIDAY THE 13TH PART V A NEW BEGINNING, SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE II) playing a slut who is picked up at a bar by Duke (Jeff Fahey), kicked out of his room, and then murdered in the actually pretty cool payphone scene.These 80's elements do not add much to the film, but certainly do not take away.Perkins also does a fine job directing, and adds a lot of dark humor to the film.Definitely check this sequel out, it's not as good as the first two but certainly better than the fourth installment and the remake.

Still battling the demons that caused her to leave the convent, she stirs the emotions in Norman and he constantly feels the urge to kill. Soon, a rash of disappearances plague the visitors of the motel, alerting Sheriff Hunt, (Hugh Gillin) and sleazy reporter Tracy Venable, (Roberta Maxwell) to the issue. Investigating the disappearances, they find a shocking secret about what's the true nature behind the motel.The Good News Another entry in the long running series initiated by the classic original, this one isn't all that bad. The fact that it's far more generously shot gives it a far better technical appearance. In one dazzling scene, there's a re-staging of the shower murder mixed with a vision of the Virgin Mary, wherein he enters a shower room just as someone attempts to commit suicide, where the sudden sight of the character in drag holding a knife becomes a vision of the Virgin Mary holding a crucifix. There's also a classic moment where the sheriff opens the ice machine and pulls out a cube to suck on in the blistering heat, whilst Norman Bates watches on in horror as the ice cubes are covered in blood. A really intense moment as well comes from a daring escape from a drowning car and comes across a really unexpected entity. The fact that the slashing came into the film more here is a nice bonus, and we get some really nice deaths. One is beaten with a guitar until it splinters, another gets sliced up with a knife that's framed to imitate the shower scene from the first one, another is decapitated, and there's also a brutal impaling with a knife. There's a few more kills here, making this one fit in pretty well with the more kill-happy crowd. This one wasn't all that bad.The Bad News There's really only a couple small comments against this one. For as much of an opportunity as there was to kill, very rarely does it show through. It's not as big of a body count as there really could've had, and it probably could've done a little better had it off a couple more here and there. The other major beef is that the film tries way to hard to mix in several different themes and ideas that some of them get shuffled around and get a little confusing. The religious angle for the events was a big one. It serves it's purpose, but it is melded into the other storyline and it becomes a mess. However, other than those, this wasn't all that bad of a film.The Final Verdict The real secret to enjoying these sequels is that they shouldn't be compared to the original. View them separately and objectively and they're actually decent films. If that sounds like a fine viewing agenda, then give this one a shot, otherwise there's no need to view it if you've already determined it won't stack up to the original.Rated R Graphic Violence, Nudity, Graphic Language, a sex scene and drug use "},{"Title":"Possible Spoilers","Date":"3 July 2005","Score":"18 out of 19 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Mystery, Thriller","Review":" The other negative reviews seem a bit harsh to me. Anyone who enjoyed the first sequel or Anthony Perkins' performance in either of the first two films will have fun watching the third installment. Not many films compare to the Hitchcock original and the sequels to PSYCHO are no exception. But anytime Anthony Perkins takes the screen as the matricidal Bates we the audience are going to be in for a treat.Slasher enthusiasts and Norman Bates fans can rejoice as Perkins brings our favorite motel owner into the 80's. While there isn't quite enough gore for PSYCHO 3 to be considered a true slasher film, Perkins, as director, makes a bold choice to bring Norman and his terrible habits into the 80's while maintaining the charming weirdness in character and setting of the original and even its first sequel. The three films definitely feel like they take place in the same world and the returning characters (or relatives of deceased former characters) help keep the story arc flowing with a consistent feel.The plot this time revolves around a nun, Maureen Coyle, who gives up her vows to God and finds herself hitching a ride with sleazy musician Duane Duke, played by the always entertaining Jeff Fahey. We all know which motel they're going to end up at and it isn't long before Norman meets Maureen in the diner and notices her initials, the same as Marion Crane's, on her suitcase. It's psycho love at first sight.Meanwhile, Duke gets a job working at The Bates Motel front desk despite Norman's obvious disliking of the greasy loner. Add to the mix a bunch of rowdy football fans and what you'll eventually get is the largest body count in a PSYCHO film yet and since.The gore, although minimal, is effective and a severed hand gag will have you laughing even though your stomach is turning. I'll never look at ice cubes the same way. Perkins also takes a stab at a shower-scene-type killing within a phone booth. It's creepy and violent like the shower sequence but, admittedly, loses some of its edge in the day and age of cellphones.Filled with religious and sexual metaphors and ripe with sardonic humor and dark sarcasm, PSYCHO 3 is just plain fun to watch. Anyone in love with Perkins' betrayal as the truly loony Norman Bates needs to give the movie another chance. To say it doesn't hold up to the original is moot since so few films (in any genre) hold up to Hitchcock's masterpiece. Try to forget its untouchable origins and enjoy the flick for what it is&#133; a better than average 80's horror movie featuring the overwhelming presence of one of film history's greatest on screen icons, played by the only man who could and ever should, Anthony Perkins. "},{"Title":"Good with a moment of genius","Date":"28 October 2005","Score":"17 out of 19 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Mystery, Thriller","Review":" Psycho 3 opens well enough with an incident to forever change the life of a distressed Maureen Coyle, and then ruins the moment with an unnecessary, not to mention unwanted, voice-over narration. Fortunately, the narration is isolated to the beginning of the film.Maureen is one of a number of characters destined to find the Bates motel, and the film begins slowly drifting into a sequel formula where typical victims (that reminded me of F13 fodder) come into Norman's path to be slaughtered.But nevermind that. Psycho 3 still understands the strength of this series lay in its unmasked killer, Norman Bates. And one of the more fascinating aspects of the film surrounds Norman and Maureen who has the same initials of that unfortunate girl from twenty years ago, Marion Crane. Cabin one?! an unnerved Norman says to his motel clerk, horrified that the circumstances today are reflecting those surrounding Marion from so long ago. And we, the viewers, note that the film is somewhat mirroring the structure of the original film - how Marion met her fate so early.Now the suspense comes from Norman's knowledge of his crimes, and knowledge of his compulsions, his sincere desire to prevent a repeat outing with the knife, and the audience knows Mother, whom doesn't like young girls in her motel, is up at the house. It's fascinating to watch how fear in Norman soul as the fates seem to unfold leading Maureen to the same end as Marion as she turns the water on and gets into the tub.SPOILER - And the moment of genius comes as mother snaps the shower curtain back to find Maureen in a bathtub of red water. And, ironically, the intended murder becomes a rescue from suicide. Then our disturbed, psychotic, Norman Bates becomes both a hero and guide to the suicidal girl, which needless to say, shakes Norman's world. As they talk in the hospital (later to share intimate moments in the motel) we see the sorrow in Norman, as he wishes for atonement by saving this girl, and that he genuinely cares for her. It places this recluse in a strange new territory, a territory that inspires him to try to fight his inner demons, to protect Maureen, and to fight against mother's compulsions to kill. END SPOILER.I never cease to be amazed at how sympathetic Norman Bates is even after knowing full well that he is a killer, even after seeing him murder, especially in this film when he's fighting so hard against what he is. We fear him, and yet pity him.As the film gears up for its climax, we watch as Duane has stumbled upon Norman's secret and attempts to blackmail him. And we're appalled that a perfectly sane (yet malicious) man would try to take advantage of another man who makes an honest struggles to stay himself. Norman is the killer, and yet Duane is the villain. I found myself leaning forward in my chair, hoping Duane would get more than he bargained for. I'd of been the little devil on Norman's shoulder saying, Kill him. This one's justified. The tributes to the original, for the most part, did not draw attention to themselves as Psycho 2's did (thank you, Anthony Perkins.) I appreciated the return to the taxidermy aspect of Bates' character, the presence of candy corn that he was always munching on, Norman's reaction to discovering a body (identical to Psycho), and the smile at the end of the film that appropriately mirrored Hitchcock's ending.Although the narrative gets clumsy in places, I appreciated Psycho 3 for its faithful continuation of the Psycho series. Most of all though, in a genre that's content to regurgitate the killer's history and theories why he kills in more and more boring detail and call it a plot, Psycho 2 and 3 gives Norman some genuinely new and original scenarios. In the Psycho sequels, we can see Norman grow and evolve, and feel the satisfaction that a new chapter had, indeed, been written.Then again, Psycho is perhaps the only slasher franchises that can continue to evolve because Norman Bates is a fully-developed, fascinatingly complex, and highly sympathetic character. He is the most mesmerizing killer to grace the silver screen in cinema history.Needless to say, neither Psycho 2 nor Psycho 3 will escape from the original's shadow. Even with the drop in craftsmanship, I was content with another stay at the Bates motel. What can I say? Norman is that much fun to hang around.

I was excited to watch Anthony Perkins's directorial debut, but I must say that this film had so much more potential to be better than it was.Psycho III in several ways, is better than Psycho II. It reveals much more about Norman as a person, not just a crazy old man with a mental illness. Anthony Perkins once told David Letterman of the Psycho franchise that They're not really horror movies. They're tragedies. I really felt sympathy for Norman in this sequel above all the others. There is not a better word to describe everything about Norman than tragic.Psycho III contains a lot of 'familar' scenes. The bell tower scene at the beginning inspired from Vertigo, when Norman's 'girlfriend' Maureen fell down the stairs of the home, done exactly the same way Detective Arbogast fell in the original film; 'floaty' like. After Norman 'saved' Maureen from her attempt at suicide, they have a quick heart-to-heart, in which Norman says We all go a little mad sometimes, a famous quote from the original. Clearly Perkins wanted to pay homage to the Master of Suspense.On to his performance - wonderful as always, but I can't help noticing that a lot of the Bates trademark movements and facial expressions were brought back in this sequel, some unnecessarily so. Sometimes it seemed as if Norman was parodying himself. Jeff Fahey as Duke, a musician with a cocky surfer boy personality was an interesting contrast.Overall, I think Perkins should be given more credit. Sure, it isn't perfect - but I think it has a lot more heart. I think if certain scenes were removed, it would have been a lot better, particularly the end of the film where he brings back the infamous grinning 'stare.' It counteracts with what Norman overcame only a scene ago. But Psycho III doesn't deserve such a low rating. It's definitely worth a look - but don't expect a masterpiece. 6/10.

But I bought the triple feature DVD pack of the Psycho sequels, I watched Psycho 3 last night, it wasn't that bad. The only complaint I have is that it felt a little too Friday the 13th to me, a little too slasher. From the first Psycho, we had more left to the imagination and a little more thriller/mystery, Psycho 3 doesn't use that same formula, but it still leaves you in chills. It is almost kind of a tribute in some of the shots and lines from the original, I think that is thanks to Anothony Perkins, it was interesting to see him direct the film, not the worst I've seen for a horror sequel, but the story itself is alright.Norman is back in business, running the Bates Motel, he needs a helping hand, so Duane Duke, musician bum, is his new assistant manager. When a former nun, Maureen, comes to stay in the motel, she reminds Norman of Marian Craine, he falls for her. But it's a question if his mother will let him be with Maureen. Duane is also bringing problems back into Norman's killing spree of bar fly's and a homecoming party.Psycho 3 is worth the look, believe me, when you've seen so many horror sequels that were just beyond horrible, this was a breathe of fresh air. The story does keep your interest, if you are into blood and gore, you will not be disappointed on that note. But I'm looking at this as to what should be a tribute to the first film, the slitting of the throat to me wasn't Norman Bates.

Psycho 3 starts off as a full blown rehash of the first film, but after seeing the ending of Psycho 2, that is not a bad thing at all. Psycho 3 could somewhat be looked at as a rehash of the first film, but it still works out well as a sequel. Of course, Norman Bates is back to the way he was in the first film, which sets up Psycho 3 in a very good way. It really gets inside Norman's psychopathic mind, which is why Psycho 3 has a noticeably darker tone than the other two films. This isn't a terrible aspect by any means. I thought that it added a whole new dimension to the film without being nothing but a repeat of the previous sequels. Psycho 3 also adds plenty of teenage slasher aspects and a very large amount of gore, which also added to the movie in a very good way.Psycho 3 is directed by Anthony Perkins, who also played as Norman Bates in all 4 original Psycho films (not counting the remake directed by Gus Van Zant). Anthony Perkins gives out many Hitchcock style images that are more of homages than anything. The biggest homage that Anthony Perkins delivered the audience was the scene outside the ice box with the dead body inside. The police officer is reaching for some ice, and suddenly we see that the ice is bloody. This resembles a pure Hitchcock trait, which I really liked to see in a sequel to the master's masterpiece.I also felt that the performances from the entire cast did an excellent job, especially for the period and genre of the film. Psycho 3 has very solid character chemistry and a very solid cast, which I also thought helped the film out in a great deal. Duane Duke is a character that I really loved to hate. Several other aspects about the cast made me love this film for what it is.The negative aspects of this film include the loss of power on repeated viewings and the brief moments of cheese. I also felt that the ending didn't deliver spot on as the previous two films did. Whatever the case may be, Psycho 3 is still an excellent watch. It may not by any means be as good as the previous two films, but still a good sequel.Recommended.

Not even Hitchcock could have done better with this one. There are many twists, turns and surprises with a very shocking and creative ending. There is not a lot of gore but there are some violent and scary scenes. All horror/slasher films should have plenty of blood and violence and Psycho III does have it's fair share.    The phone booth scene is done so brilliantly that it brings back the nostalgia of the first Psycho, this scene however is done so much better, with greater detail and special effects. It is also a lot more vivid in blood red color as opposed to Hershey's syrup which was used in the original Psycho. This film was also made over 26 years later so you would come to expect this with newer technology.     Psycho II was also a very good film but not as good as this one. Unfortunately, four years later another Psycho film was made and released directly to cable. It was a bore and had nothing to do with the series. Believe it or not Norman Bates was out of the Bates Motel and was basically discussing his childhood relationship with his mother over the phone to a radio talk show.       Psycho III to me was the perfect way to finish off the series. Since a part four was going to be made I would have liked to have seen Norman and mom at it again, this time with an even higher body count and more gore at the Bates Motel.

Meanwhile, the body count continues to rack up at the Bates Motel. Director Perkins, working from a wickedly witty and perverse script by Charles Edward Pogue, astutely nails Norman's torment; this entry in the popular slasher series has a firm and fascinating grasp on Bates' considerable pain and angst. This in turn adds a fair amount of poignancy to the movie. Perkins and Scarwid are both outstanding in the lead roles. The supporting cast are likewise fine Jeff Fahey as smarmy dirt bag Duane Duke, Roberta Maxwell as snoopy, meddlesome tabloid journalist Tracy Venable, Hugh Gillin as the gregarious Sheriff John Hunt, the ravishing Juliette Cummins as saucy barroom pick-up Red, and future director Katt Shea Ruben as the lady who gets killed on the toilet. Offbeat kinky and blackly humorous touches abound Norman discovering Maureen in the bathtub with her wrists slit when he goes to her motel room to kill her (Maureen mistakes Mother for the Virgin Mary!), the corpse in the ice chest, and the strikingly sick moment when Norman lays a long, lingering kiss on one of his female victims. The phone booth murder set piece is truly brutal and shocking. The pervasively seedy atmosphere adds immensely to the overall creepiness. Bruce Surtees' polished cinematography and Carter Burwell's quirky, spooky, harmonic score are solid and effective. A superior and underrated sequel.

I think the macabre humor is the stand-out plus for the film with two or three sequences very inspired. And, I was one of those who liked the possible love angle for Norman.Norman(Anthony Perkins, still very good)has been living quite a quiet existence until numerous things begin to take shape that will only result in tragedy. It starts with the whole fact that Mrs. Spool's disappearance is a constant reminder in the film. Her ghost looms over Norman as certain characters may possibly uncover what he did to Spool in the last film. The three most important characters in this second sequel change Norman's life, all for the worse in many ways.First, he hires Duane Duke(Jeff Fahey, perhaps overdoes he role), one of those pretty boy-white trash types with his all-smiles charm that wins over many a lady unless you're the type that sees through all that for what he really is. We see, though, a nasty streak permeate in certain situations that recognize that Duke is anything but the nicest guy in the world. He gives Diana Scarwid's Maureen Coyle a ride when she wishes to escape from a horrible occurrence and we later see the monster inside Duke as he tries to molest her when he pulls over because of a severe down-pour. When she slaps him for not stopping, he says adiós leaving her to stand in the rain. Later, he takes on a temporary job for Norman who needs an assistant to help around the Bates Motel(In an inspired moment, Duke tells Norman, I just won't be staying around too long. Norman, with that stuffed owl and it's wings spread behind him overhead, answers, No one ever does.)He picks up a dame at a local bar, and after she puts out, throws her out of his room with nothing but a shower of insults down-grading her.Second, a reporter working on a piece about psychopathic behavior and if they should be released from prison, named Tracy Venable(Roberta Maxwell)will not go away. She actually hires Duke to spy on Norman since he could probably notice strange behavior or other unorthodox types of behavior which might yield guilty suspicions of dangerous activity. She begins snooping around Mrs. Spool's life and is always trying to probe into Norman's life one way or another. If anyone will sniff out what Norman might do wrong, she will.The third character in the film is Maureen Coyle who looks like Marian Crane(the scene in which Norman spots MC on her suitcase, and his horrified reaction, are golden moments of jet black humor)and is so shaken in how her life has turned out she tries to commit suicide while staying at the Bates Motel. Duke, not knowing that Room # 1 is a no-no to hand out to just anyone, gives that room to Maureen only adding to the macabre joke that Norman's psychological baggage is carrying yet another heavy bit of luggage. When Mother decides to put an end to Maureen she finds that the young, tortured woman has already slit her wrists. In the most fascinating sequence in the film, Maureen is looking up at Mother, but she sees through her crazed mind, The Virgin Mary. After surviving the suicide attempt, thanks to Norman who just happened to stop by in order to drop off clean towels, they start a warm, friendly relationship which doesn't go over well with Mother. This is a film that is unlike the other two films because it is effected by the slasher genre(this is an example many users have already pointed out, but I just wanted to reiterate it). The violence that occurs to several people is much more potent and bloody. Perkins, as director, has a heavy religious sub-text within the story that shows how disillusioned poor Maureen is, and after accidentally killing a nun in a bell-tower, is searching for her own private island. She freely admits to a priest/psychiatrist that lust was mainly why she couldn't fully become a nun and that might just end in bad results for her because of the location she winds up at. The Bates Motel seems to be a place that attracts people trying to get away from something. I think the mystery of who is killing is more than obvious. Sure, Perkins shrouds the person in drag with shadow, but the figure is more than recognizable if you look hard enough. Not to mention, there only a few possible suspects since very few characters frequent within the story. I can't tell if Fahey is just badly acting or if this character is trying to put out the charm loudly placing outwardly this facade of Mr. Nice Guy until his more sinister side comes out..specifically towards women. He might identify with Norman more than we think, and Perkins often photographs him as a disturbing type of fellow who might have homicidal tendencies. I feel he's a scumbag just out to make a buck, and always looking to bag a dame..he's your heel that you just know will eventually clash with Norman. But, as I pointed out earlier on, I think the love angle was an important step, even if it was merely inevitable that something(mainly, Mother)would cease it from forming into something amazing for Norman to shift his existence into the norm.

Making a sequel a decade or two later is tricky and can result in disaster, but 'Psycho II' was in good hands. It was also a hit with viewers, critics, and at the Box Office. With Horror being the hot ticket it was at the time it was no surprise that Universal had interest in furthering the series. But just where could they go after II? Not only would Anthony Perkins return to reprise his famous role, he also got behind the camera as the director. What came of that was a sequel even better than the one before it.Pros Powerful opening sequence. Solid performances all around. Brilliant directorial debut for Perkins, who infuses the film with much style. Nice cinematography. Haunting score, quite different from the others. Briskly paced. Intense murder sequences. Good dark sense of humor. Suspenseful story.Cons Nothing much new added to the series.Final thoughts By number 3 you would think things would become stale, but that could not be further from the truth. Though still not on par with the first film, III is a really good follow up that's better than it has a right to be.

Norman Bates is officially insane once again. In part two we questioned his sanity up until the ending, but in this third Psycho there is no doubt he is crazy. It starts off with an unstable nun named Maureen who, while trying to commit suicide, accidentally causes the death of another nun. Shunned by the convent, she accepts a ride from a sleazy musician named Duke (Jeff Fahey). She escapes his sexual assault by jumping out of the car into the pouring rain. Duke ends up at the Bates Motel and accepts a job from Norman to look after the place during the day. Maureen ends up at the motel too and is startled to see Duke. Norman see's her and immediately thinks of Marion Crane, the woman he killed in the shower in the first Psycho. Norman becomes unhinged at the sight of her and his murderous rampage continues leading up to a satisfying ending.Psycho III adds a lot more gore and a lot more nudity, appropriate with the times I assume. Horror in 1986 was filled with blood and sex, so I guess Psycho III felt it had to compete with slasher hits like the latest Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street sequels. The gore and sleaze just doesn't work with a Psycho film though. I have nothing against that in horror, but it makes Psycho III a lesser film when compared to the second one. The pace of this one however is very good, and there certainly isn't a dull moment. It's fun and interesting to watch Norman lose his cool, and Anthony Perkins played it brilliantly as always.Psycho III was directed by Perkins, and overall was a pretty good horror flick. There is a religious undertone with the character of Maureen who was a nun before meeting Norman. The murder scenes are very gory and realistically done. There is also a cringe worthy scene where the sheriff eats a bloody piece of ice. The ice is of course bloody because Norman stuffed a body in his new Bates Motel ice machine. Psycho III is a decent addition to the series and also adds to the back story of the Bates family. Roberta Maxwell does a good job as the grating reporter and Diana Scarwid plays the role of the naive Maureen perfectly.7/10 "},{"Title":"Stylish, sometimes darkly funny sequel.","Date":"18 October 2010","Score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Mystery, Thriller","Review":" An young woman by the name of Maureen Coyle (Diana Scarwid) was training to be an nun but she has lost her faith.

Psycho 3 does have its ups and downs but it is certainly amusing for die-hard fans of the series. Originally the script by Charles Edward Pogue (Dragonheart, The Fly 1986, Kull the Conqueror) was much darker. Originally Dwayne Duke was a killer, who was obsessed with Norman and Maureen Coyle was going to be the new psychologist for Norman. In some ways, that version of that movie, if it was made. It could be been better but Universal rejected the ideas. Some film critics and fans of the series certainly liked Psycho 3 more than Psycho 2. So, judge it for yourself.

Norman is still rehabilitated, reopened the motel, and is hiring some help. He meets up with a drifter named Duke (Jeff Fahey) who he hires as an assistant manager and with a young woman known as Maureen Coyle (Diana Scarwid), who bears a striking resemblance to one of his former victims (who we all know of!). A snoopy reporter named Tracy Venable (Roberta Maxwell) is also around, trying to prove that Norman had something to do with the disappearance of Mrs. Spool, from Psycho II.There are so many scenes in this film that remind me of the original Psycho that it's not hard to figure out that Perkins was owing tribute to the master of suspense. Examples reuse of the lines, we all go a little mad sometimes and mother, oh god mother, blood! blood!, scenes of Janet Leigh getting hacked up in the shower, a woman who looks like Marion Crane, whom Norman falls in love with, scene with Norman looking through the peephole, a take on the shower scene but this time in a phone booth, the shouting matches with Mother, a take on the falling down the stairs death, and plenty of other ones I can't think of right now. There is way too much blood in this though, though Psycho II had it's share of violent moments, this entry goes overboard with the blood, and senseless killings. The cast is so so. Roberta Maxwell is annoying, Diana Scarwid is ok, and Jeff Fahey was downright nasty and awful. The only cast member who does a terrific job, as usual, is Anthony Perkins. This is followed by Psycho IV The Beginning, which was a made-for-tv prequel, but I don't consider it a real part of the series.

It builds a little more on the twist of Psycho II(I won't reveal that here, for anyone who hasn't seen it), and though it did an OK job, I still found it to be too far-fetched to make sense, like the first one did. The twist in this one barely even made sense at all, and was almost totally unbelievable. The killing seemed more or less random, which wasn't a problem of the first, and(to the best of my recollection) not the second one, either. In this one, they just seemed to knock off minor characters whenever the film dropped in pace. The plot is reasonably good, quickly grabs your attention and keeps it throughout the entire runtime. It never really drops in pace for too long at a time, and you never lose interest in it. The acting ranges, of course Perkins pulls off the same excellent performance he also did for the first two. The characters were reasonably well-written and credible. All in all, this is a decent sequel.

Perkins also served as director for this entry and, while he sets up many interesting sequences (both visually and viscerally), he struggles with the narrative--which falls back too easily on a rote formula--and with his own performance (also rote). Bruce Surtees, a wonderful cinematographer, adds a touch of class (after a disappointing opening), and Diana Scarwid is lovely and sympathetic as the runaway nun. Unfortunately, the slashings (one to a nearly-topless woman in a phone booth, another to a young woman on the toilet) are distasteful, and a would-be kinky sex scene is uncomfortably reminiscent of Ken Russell's Crimes of Passion, which also starred Perkins.

I love the toilet kill scene, as we see the roll of toilet paper roll down in a similar way to the shower curtain being pulled in the first film. The film picks up where number 2 left off, with Norman having reverted to his old ways after his real mother confronted him. This means there is a true lack of mysterious suspense surrounding the film. Having seen the second film, Bates is still a character to root for, as we know he has the capabilities to be good, but it's the insanity around him that causes him to slip.

There are too many similarities to the first PSYCHO but those were made on purpose I think, to give some kind of continuity to the story, and to show to the viewer that everything came back to the beginning, as the end of PSYCHO II, by the way, suggests! BATES is on his motel again to receive more customers, but he gets upset when he sees a young woman, with short blond hair, carrying a case with the initials MC going to his motel&#133; she makes him remember someone from the past MARION CRANE! But he will be nice to her&#133; He even will save her life, and almost will get laid with her!...As I said, this film has some refreshing elements and is not so clichéd like the last one. One of those is some dark humour that for the very first time is introduced. It is sublime but it is very effective! I can remember, for instance, some scenes 1) when the Xerife is putting some ice full of blood on his mouth and he didn't even noticed; 2) the apparition of the Virgin Mary, and later when the blond girl says And that woman in the window, there must have been Virgin Mary too!; and finally 3) The mother watching some cartoons in the cabin!... Pretty hilarious! The plot never has a twist; it's straighter than PSYCHO II and much more revealing. The end explains it all, and for the first time the viewer sees, with his own eyes, the schizophrenic personality of NORMAN BATES. Yes, that's true, we see him acting and speaking like his mother, using her voice, when he's dressed with her cloths!Nice sequel too. Also deserves a 7/10 score!

Well, I have to say, the acting is superb, the direction is great, the lighting is amazing, but the storyline is weak. It's just a re-hash of what happened the two previous installments. Storywise, the only addition to the film is the Catholic subplot, which was great, but other than that it's pretty much all that we've seen before, only with much more gore and sex. Still, the film manages to pull out just as great, feeling very much like a giallo and the Argento influence is obvious with the amazing color palette, mixed with echoes of film-noir, with it's great use of shadow. As mentioned before, the film the religious imagery works very well in the film, giving it more depth, and a different interpretation of the events. I really like how, it seemed that former nun - Maureen Coyle's journey was going to have the same ending Marion Crane had, as mother approached the bathroom curtain, to try to stab Maureen, but only to find that Maureen had already slit her own wrists! That's the highlight of the film for me, it was really surprising. Also, in this film, mother is more visible to be seen behind the curtain of her bedroom window and the scenes where he talks to the corpse of Emma Spool, which now he calls mother are pretty disturbing. The ending is basically the same ending of the original film, and it seemed that then, everything will start over again! But the film is very much worth a watch, if only for the visuals and a great music score filled with demonic chants and a theme that is a dead ringer of Tubular Bells from The Exorcist.

First and foremost, like many films, it was rushed.  There were 22 years between I & II, which is probably why II was so good.  Secondly, it was made at the wrong time.  In the short time that passed between II & III, films had become a wasteland of gore and splatter effects with the success of Friday the 13th and others of the horror genre.  Where the other 3 films strayed to the psychological side, this one went more for the gore.  Which is sad since Perkins himself directed this one.  Third problem, the story was weak.  Now Bates is certifiably insane, and (as Vera Miles put it in II) up to his old tricks again.  Instead of leaving us to wonder, we find this out very early on in the movie, which is rather unsatisfying.  Although the film has many flaws, it does have its merits.  In this one, we do get to see what Bates is like when he's on the brink of madness, pushed over the edge by the arrival of Diana Scarwid, who somewhat resembles Janet Leigh (not closely enough though).  And the storyline is tied up about the arrival of Norman's real mother.  Even with the film's problems, Perkins is phenomenal with his portrayal of the insane-again Bates.  Jeff Fahey gives a standout performance as the drifter who takes a job at the motel.  Now, Diana Scarwid doesn't give a bad performance, but she just wasn't right for the role in my humble opinion.  Her resemblance to Leigh is slight and her character's naivity comes off as stupidity.  I liked her in a few other films, but always felt she wasn't right for this one -- or maybe it was just the way her character was written.  I don't know.  A must-see for fans of the Psycho-series, but probably ONLY for fans of the Psycho-series.

Maureen haunts Norman reminding him of Marion Crane. Norman goes in to kill Maureen only to find her half-conscious in a suicide attempt.It's great to see Perkins with his iconic role. He plays Norman's madness quite well but he's not the best director. The movie lacks the needed intensity. Perkins is unable to recreate the great Hitchcock's work and times have also moved on. This is a combination of the original psychological horror and the modern slasher movie. Perkins isn't able to pull it off completely.I do love the Maureen character and Norman's recall back to Marion Crane. She should command greater attention and should be the center of the climax. The order of the final kills are a little off. Duane and Tracy could be more compelling characters if they're not outsiders.

The movie has really good acting and some characters are more likable than others. I found Norman Bates more likable than for example Duane (aka Duke) played by Jeff Fahey. The storyline makes you get more in contact with Norman than before and I really liked that. This movie delivers more blood for the viewer that the first one and the second one didn't have that much of, I don't know what to think about that to be honest, while the first one lived on it's mystery, the second one and the third one feels more like typical 80's slashers. Everything else with the production such as lighting, camera-work,sound etc. is all very good. I really loved the soundtrack as well, it has a very creepy tone to it just like the original had, now I don't compare these two movies with each other in the terms of soundtrack but I would say that if you mixed the original soundtrack and made it a little bit more 80's you would get a soundtrack like the one in this motion picture. To be honest at the time Im writing this down I can't come up with anything bad about the movie, sure it's not a masterpiece and there might be something missing but I just can't put my finger on what.

Perkins, in fact, was initially reluctant to appear in Psycho II, made three years earlier, but by 1986 he seems to have fallen in love with his best-known character; he was to appear in a fourth film in 1990.The events of the film take place one month after the events of Psycho II. Perkins, having given us Norman mad in Hitchcock's original, and Norman sane (albeit fighting desperately to hold on to his sanity) in its sequel, now gives us Norman mad again. I don't really need to tell you any more of the plot, although there is a new twist in that one of the women ill-fated enough to turn up at the Bates Motel is a suicidal ex-nun who has left her convent after losing her faith in God and inadvertently causing the death of another nun while trying unsuccessfully to kill herself. (The woman's name is Maureen Coyle; she is deliberately given the same initials as Marion Crane, Norman's victim in the original film). The surprise ending of the second film reversed what we thought we knew about Norman's family background; this film reverses the reversal by restoring the status quo ante.Of all the Psycho series this is by far the weakest. (Psycho IV was, to my surprise, a considerable improvement). It was also a box-office failure, which possibly explains why the fourth instalment was made as a TV movie. Perkins was presumably so obsessed with his character that he wanted to explain what happened to Norman after the events narrated in Psycho II, and proves himself a capable actor in his portrayal of a man in the grip of an uncontrollable mania. As a director, however, he is in nothing like the same class as Hitchcock or even as Richard Franklin who directed Psycho II. The action does not flow smoothly, the film at times seems to move too slowly and Perkins achieves the feat of making it seem gruesome without making it in the least scary. Apart from Perkins himself, none of the acting contributions stand out. The religious theme, introduced with the character of Maureen, is not well integrated with the rest of the film. Perkins seems to have gone to the well once too often with this one. 4/10 "},{"Title":"Nice homage to the Original","Date":"21 November 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Mystery, Thriller","Review":" Opens with a scream of There is no God and follows an ex-nun who happens upon the Bates Motel.

It's not long, however, until Mrs Bates starts killing again!I think the film could have done without the religious aspect and instead gone in a different direction. That being said, it isn't a bad film.This is the first instalment in which you know who is doing all the killing, but this doesn't take away from the film - in fact I think the audience expects to see Mrs Bates/Norman killing people.The shower scene from the original movie is shown again, but it's done with more style than in the second film and is actually relevant in this film. Further, there is a new take on the shower scene regarding a bath instead and with a different outcome.It was good to hear We all go a little mad, sometimes again as it is one of my favourite movie quotes and there are many other homages to the original in this film.Anthony Perkins again plays the part of Norman Bates well, albeit with less cheeky smirks and less boyish innocence. As with Psycho2 the supporting cast, again, slip to the background in the shadow of Perkins. The man who helps out at the motel and the sheriff are perhaps the only two that are memorable.The fact that it's 1.5 hours long earns it half a star more to equal my score of 2-hour long Psycho 2.

What follows will surprise no-one, with a few mildly gory murders mixed in with lots of mock-crazy psycho-babble.Anthony Perkins is inevitably the best thing about this movie, as his performance as the disturbed Norman is head and shoulders above the rest of the cast. And while I ever enjoy seeing Jeff Fahey in a movie, his character is just too sleazy and unlikeable here to be entertaining.

Bring back the sheriff, cook and back story of Mrs Poole I thought was phenomenal writing maintaining the story and keeping it intact to the previous two. There was also a lot of little shots and dialog bits that played homage to the original two which I didn't mind since it was overloaded with them.

Perkins hit the nail on the head with his direction and the camera work is excellent. The property of the Bates Motel feels alone and abandoned until the guests arrive and even though there are finally people all around, Norman feels alone and isolated and slowly starts to unravel.

On Valentine's Day, 1986, first-time director, Anthony Perkins (Norman Bates himself), released 'Psycho 3' and, at the time, no one cared. It's a shame because, unlike 'Psycho 2' &#x96; which spent a lot of time and energy reproducing and imitating Hitchcock - this is a totally new and much darker take on a scenario that we already know quite well.If you haven't seen the previous 'Psycho' films, there are a number of sub-plots and asides in 'Psycho 3' that will mean absolutely nothing to you. It is a film that really hinges on all the previous elements and as careful as I was in my 'Psycho 2' review not to reveal all the twist and turns, it was all for not because 'Psycho 3' defiantly unravels every one of them.Much like the original, the film starts with a woman running away. This time it's a very disturbed nun who has left her convent having lost her faith in God and her will to live. Janet Leigh look-alike, Maureen Coyle (Diana Scarwid - 'Mommie Dearest' / 'Rumble Fish') treks across the desert where she is picked up by a very sleazy Jeff Fahey ('The Lawnmower Man' / 'Body Parts'). The two wanderers end up checking into the Bates Motel and, by now, you should have a hint at what's in store for them.There are a few attempts at building on the 'Psycho' mythology but there aren't any big surprises and there really isn't one over-arching story (unless you take the previous films into account). Here's a rundown of the sub-plots tied in 1.) Maureen has lost all direction and Norman feels sorry for her so they go on a date before she gets killed. 2.) Duke, Fahey's character, is working his way out to L.A. where he's going to be a big rock star. He learns a bit more about Norman than he should and tries to use this to his advantage. 3.) There's a reporter trying to discredit Norman's sanity and disprove the truth about Norman's mother (one of the twists from 'Psycho 2'). 4.) The Bates Motel is full of guests for once and Norman has to sneak around killing them (for no reason).What's so different about this sequel? For starters, I'm not really sure who the main character is. Unlike the previous sequel, Norman doesn't seem to be conflicted any longer; he's back to taxidermy, he's got 'Mother' back, he's peeking through holes in bathroom walls, and he's quick to kill. Maureen barely has any screen time and, though she is introduced as a possible heroin, her character doesn't really go anywhere (a la Marian Crane). Duke is too repellant to root for (but gets more screen time than almost anyone). So, oddly enough, the closest we're given to a protagonist is Roberta Maxwell's ('Popeye' / 'Philadelphia') reporter who is the least interesting character with the biggest payoff.All in all, this is the most sequeley sequel you will ever see and that should be enough to spark your curiosity.

Perkins did another good job in his role, portraying a more sympathetic and confused Norman Bates rather than a psychotic madman. Diana Scarwid gave a mysterious performance as Maureen, providing a somewhat Marion Crane-ish role. You get to see some flashback scenes to the original Psycho, including the iconic shower scene, which I thought was sort of awkward when you have this movie filmed in color flashing back to a prequel scene filmed in black and white.

While I could never bring myself to say out loud that I didn't like any of the sequels to Psycho, the third one was always my least favorite. Thanks to Scream Factory, I was given a reason to refresh my memory and change my opinion after viewing the Psycho III Collector's Edition.Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) can't seem to get a break. In the short amount of time he's been back running his infamous motel, Norman has dealt with an elaborate attempt to send him back to the nuthouse and faced a revelation about his mother that could send anyone over the edge who's already jumped off it once (or twice) before. Just as he is about to continue his renovations of the Bates Motel, a young stranger (Diana Scarwid) who resembles one of his previous victims shows up on his doorstep. Can Norman finally get out from under his mother's shadow and find love or will he slip into insanity once again?What I once considered merely a slasher film now ties with Psycho II as one of my favorite of the sequels. Most follow-ups pale in comparison to the originals, but that's not the case with the Psycho films. Psycho III excels thanks to it being directed by the man who not only brought Norman Bates to life, but also dedicated a great portion of his life to the character and living in his shadow.I believe Anthony Perkins did what he felt was necessary when taking the reins of Psycho III. He knew there was more to tell of Norman's story, but was terrified of what might happen if someone else was put in charge of the project. Instead, he took the Director's chair and did his best to stay true to Alfred Hitchcock's cinematic vision of Robert Bloch's novel.Perkins is given a chance in Psycho III to show the softer side of Norman to audiences. He reveals that Bates wants to be normal and have a life away from Mother. It also does a great job of showing the inner conflict he has with himself (and Mother, if you will).It almost seems like Perkins was trying to take Psycho III where Hitchcock wanted to go with the original in regards of graphicness, but the censors at the time wouldn't allow him. There's quite a bit more sexual content and even the scenes of violence are amped up. It's as if he's trying to reach some level of shock that Hitchcock was trying to achieve but couldn't get there in 1960.Thanks to Anthony Perkins' portrayal of Norman Bates and his personal touch as Director, you really get a deeper look into the tragic psyche of the man behind the murderer.

Needless to say, these sequels will forever live in the shadow of Hitchcock's masterpiece, although, as with 'Psycho II', there are enough positive elements to suggest that good intentions were at work. Anthony Perkins returns as Norman (and also directs) and of course mother is up and about again, so pretty soon the motel has a few more vacancies. Truth to tell, this isn't such a bad movie Perkins supplies some effective moments behind the camera and the script contains a satisfying line in black humour. Unfortunately proceedings descend into self-parody at times, with Perkins crying 'Mother!' every five minutes, and the shocks skew closer to a cheap slasher flick than is necessary.

And in some ways, this is certainly true. We have gone from having any semblance of a thriller to just straight-up 1980s horror, with a body count and blood. And for some of us, who enjoy the 1980s slasher film, this is actually an improvement.Perkins, who both stars and directs, did his best to keep the Universal spirit. He brought back guys who had done makeup effects on the original Psycho, which really means something. Both parts two and three (and four) were overseen by producer Hilton Green, who had been the assistant director on the original film. With Hitch gone, Green may have been the closest person to the classic.But we also have some new faces -- Jeff Fahey, who would go on to be a science fiction and horror icon, really shines in his role as Duke (and apparently caught the eye of a young Quentin Tarantino). Brinke Stevens also has a role, though you never get to see her face.The Scream Factory disc is a must-have. While the features on part two were a bit of a let-down, for this one they not only have an audio commentary, but four new interviews with Fahey, Stevens, Katt Shea and effects artist Michael Westmore.

He yells at her that he has the same terrible blood in his veins, and it makes him do what he does. Perkins uses Woody Woodpecker on the television interestingly, as Norman cries to his mother to stop laughing at him (which of course is Woody's iconic laugh), and it's so very evident more than ever before how his world is a mixture of reality with a heavy dose of surreal experiences; we've already known this, but for the first time it's almost spelled out in front of us, as he can't even tell the difference between his mother's laugh (one he no doubt knows all too well), and a cartoon bird on the television. There are so many little pieces like that which make Psycho III better than its low rating on here suggests. Norman finally meets someone to love in a disheartened girl who has left her convent where she was poised to become a nun by the name of Maureen; unfortunately for Norma at first, she reminds him of Marion Crane. There are two really interesting bits Perkins throws in involving Maureen. The first is when Norman sees her in the diner, and she leans down towards the floor behind the stool she sits on, but he can only picture Marion laying dead in the shower after he and mother killed her. Soon he snaps back to reality, and leaves the diner quickly. Maureen later ends up at the motel, and tries to kill herself by slitting her wrists in the bathtub. Norman is poised to kill her, all dressed up like mother again, but he finds her with her wrists open in the water, and Maureen does not see Mrs. Bates she sees the Virgin Mary holding a silver crucifix where the knife should be. One of the best moments come when Norman accidentally nudges Maureen over the stairs in his house, and she slips down over them only to fall against a statue with a sharp object protruding out of it. The statue is of Cupid, and Perkins zooms in on the arrow after it has killed Maureen, which drips blood; Cupid has literally shot her, and in a way it has also pierced Norman by taking away the only woman he ever loved. Here, Cupid shows us how everything in Norman's world is backwards; especially love.My only complaint about the film is at the very end when Norman sits in a police car being taken away, and he hauls out a little treat he was hiding to caress, as he gives a look very reminiscent to his final scene in the original Psycho. I find it a little hard to believe the police wouldn't have found this on him (I won't tell you what it is), but then again, it's a horror movie, and a certain amount of belief has to be suspended at times to properly enjoy one. Overall, it didn't ruin anything for me. 8 out of 10 stars for a great entry into the Psycho franchise. People say that Anthony Perkins tried to imitate Hitchcock in this film, but I frankly cannot see it. There's a huge difference in visual style, and a very glaring difference in storytelling. Norman is a little more slasher in this film, but why shouldn't he be? At the end of Psycho II, we are introduced to someone who could be Norman's real mother right before he kills her, so naturally the man is going to be even worse off than ever before with shocking information like that. Of course, the story is a long, winding road, and that isn't every side, but isn't a family history like Norman's bound to drive ANYONE a little mad? After all, we all go a little mad sometimes...

This takes place almost a month after the events of the previous film with Norman Bates (Perkins) living in solitude. Soon, he meets money-hungry musician, Duane Duke (Fahey) whom he hires to work for him at his motel and runaway nun, Maureen Coyle (Scarwid) whom reminds him of someone from his past. Norman starts to find romance with Maureen and his mother starts to interfere where people begin getting slaughtered. Maxwell plays reporter, Tracy Venable who uncovers the truth about Norman and his family.

Like Bronson of '86, Norman is back in a big way. A guilt harvesting nun, (the always, fantastic, versatile, Diana Scarwid who you should also check out in Extremities) with suicidal tendencies, causes the accidental death of her mother superior, whatever, in a bell tower, flees this convent. She hitches a ride in the wrong car, with a not so nice struggling musician, Duane, oh yeah, but he's friends call him Duke, which I'm sure he doesn't have many of. Day becomes night, and our Duke is randy. She's heaved out of the musician's car after rejecting his advances. He yells after her. You could of been coming instead of going, as she's left there, sopping wet. Unfortunately the two meet again, at the infamous Bates Motel, still run by the cooky Norman (Perkins, never better) who likes stuffing birds while slapping peanut butter on crackers, and downing them like smarties. Duane, now co running the hotel, becomes a kind of informant for a snooping, pesky, female reporter (a fantastic Roberta Maxwell) following up an old victim, still missing. The drained Scarwid, like Duane, takes up residence in one of Norman's rooms. What can I say, business is slow. She falls for Norman, who's still losing it, evidently shown as he still has conversations with his dead mother, and zones out, seeing severed fingers stitched up, whatever. But she's losing too, in one scene, slitting her wrists. A quite graphic scene. No wonder they become a couple. There's some quite heavy, stylized violence, here and about, this the goriest psycho of them all, but we really must thank the scriptwriter here (who also penned The Fly remake) who's fashioned a smart script of situations and dialogue, which really works. I like too, after the cops question Norman, where they're just about to go, one of them grabs of handful of ice out of those old boxes. The ice has some blood on it. I wonder why. But the taste of the blood goes undetected. Surely he would of tasted it. Well no movies perfect. That aside, for Psycho fans, this one is a must, and shows Perkins as a great director here. It'd be interesting to hear Hitchcock's opinion on this one, if still alive, but that I guess, we'll never know. This is the most shocking Psycho, and I dig it's poster, and tagline. The ending, will let you wonder, Will Norman ever get his act together? Good stuff.

It's when ex-nun Maureen Coyle, Diana Screwld, walked into Norman's life that his very fragile mind suddenly sapped!

As nutty as well as homicidal as ever Norman whips himself up into a white hot frenzy murdering more people then he did in the original Psycho yet no one in town including the local Sheriff John Hund, Hugh Gillin, ever suspects him of doing it!

The only murder that Norman commits in the film that wasn't sanctioned by his embalmed mom was that of pot smoking guitarist, and assistant manager of the Bates Motel, Duane Duke, Jeff Fahey. It was Duke who found out about Norman's weird mother fixation and planned to blackmail him with it. Not quite realizing what he was up against, a dangerous homicidal lunatic, Duke who was obviously high on drugs and not in full control of his mental faculties ended up paying for his measly, what amount of cash could he get from Norman anyway, attempt of making a quick and dishonest buck.

Despite not being quite up to his usual antics in Part 2, Norman Bates has gone back to his old ways full blown this time, nobody is safe.Psycho 3 is obviously a cash in attempt at the growing slasher boom of the 1980's. I mean what better way to capitalise on the success of Freddy, Jason and Michael than to bring back one of cinema's first notorious serial killers - barking' mad Norman Bates. The move away from Hitchcock's classic towards 80s teenage slasher which in my opinion is a sell out which is disappointing, The first one didn't need sex and gore to make it brilliant and instead concentrated on suspense and character development, and the sequel although not as good as the first one was a good and worthy follow up and still maintained the suspense the first one had. All of which in this sequel have gone which is a shame and wasn't necessary, and I don't get why. I'm not saying that this is a bad movie, it is actually pretty good and very entertaining the Mother with a knife in hand is a great addition to the franchise and certainly what makes the Psycho films stand out in they're own way.Anthony Perkins performance is as great as always, his portrayal of troubled psychopath Norman Bates is what saves this movie from being just another forgettable slasher movie, no-one can play cross dresser serial killer with such depth like Anthony Perkins can and again he was the best star of the movie. Jeff Fahey is also suitably slimy as the drifter Duane, his character was enjoyable and fun who stupidly tries to get one over on Norman Bates...Big Mistake. Diana Scarwid played her part of Maureen Coyle really well with such vulnerability, she's such a great actress in this movie as the kind but troubled former nun, running away from her troubled past. Roberta Maxwell was not bad but she didn't stand out from the rest, I found her character pretty annoying and rather bland and 80's Slasher icon Juliette Cummins the sexy red-head was fun to watch again she's gorgeous and again shows her beautiful body, her part was smaller in this slasher than her previous slashers (Friday The 13th Part 5 and Slumber Party Massacre 2) which is a shame but oh well at least we get to hear her scream, it would have been nice to have seen more of her in this movie.All in all Psycho III is a decent Slasher but Unfortunately whereas we were unaware of Bates' secret past in the original and he was purposely framed by a copycat in the sequel, here we know all too well where the film is heading. Any attempts at hiding it are weak to say the least so of course when the finale occurs, there is no twist. Sadly the franchise continues to keep going down hill after this one.

Psycho is now an official Hollywood cash cow, a franchise to be exploited and run into the ground. Norman Bates action figures and souvenir ash trays cannot be too far behind.The movie revives Norman, his Mom, and their haunted house hotel and serves up victims left and right. Between the incessantly noisy students, the crazy nun, the brassy reporter, and the guitar-playing loser, Norman's cup runneth over in the slasher victim department. The scene with the naked guitar player, doing his seductive lamp dance has to be seen to be believed.Meanwhile, Norman putters around, not sure whether he's a killer, a victim, or a necrophiliac (he plants a big kiss on a dead body in one scene). Despite his legacy of madness and murder, people are drawn to his house like it's an amusement park ride. The nutcase nun does the Martin Basalm jig down the stairs. The reporter inexplicably pokes around the dark house until she encounters Norman and then runs around, shrieking to him the truth about his past while he chases her around manically with a knife.The experience manages to be both laughable and incredibly tedious rather than scary or suspenseful.

It was an extremely feeble attempt to enter Bates into the slasher franchise genre (Let's see a 'Myers Vs. Bates' movie) and it failed harder than sending Pinhead into space.

I guess the writers of #3 did actually watch the first two (even with just a 90-minute running time, a good portion is flashbacks in B&W whether or not the scenes were originally) as they wanted to add some more good/strange characters into the mix, much like this series predecessors. Some villains are so good as baddies, you unbelievably want them to survive/succeed, such as Hannibal Lecter. I can't believe how much I wanted Norman dead in this movie, hopefully ending the series, or even this movie sooner.

In fact, this is the movie all (including myself) feared #2 would've been when they decided to make a sequel to one of the greatest movies of all time. It's just sad how they think Bates was worth turning into another Myers, Voorhees or Kruger.

The swaggering Fahey is looking for a brief job as a helper at the motel and Scarwid is a woman who almost meets her fate in a bathtub, much the way heroine Janet Leigh did in the original until a twist in the plot saves her.The film does manage to maintain suspenseful moments in credible fashion, thanks to some astute directorial touches by Perkins, who directed himself in this reincarnation of Norman. But it never becomes anything remotely as engrossing as Hitchcock's edge of the seat thriller, slow to deliver the kind of shocking moments of surprise (and humor) that made PSYCHO so much more enjoyable. Instead, it settles for being a slasher film and not a very good one.PSYCHO III is the weakest of the first three films. The much more creative PSYCHO IV THE BEGINNING, is a much better piece of work with a finely crafted and clever storyline making it a worthy sequel to Hitch's classic.Summing up The weakest point of the film is Perkins' own performance as Norman. A hammy streak has crept into his acting by this time. You won't know whether to laugh or cry at some of his frightening expressions.

Part II is a great Horror movie with slasher influences and it didn't disappoint because of it's solid acting, great script, and gory death scenes. Unfortunately, part III lacks of the elements that made part II a winner.Norman Bates still manages the infamous Bates Motel even though it's bad reputation scares customers away. The motel's unlucky customers and personal this time include a crazy ex nun, a depraved rocker, and a female reporter obsessed with the Bates history. Norman's life isn't normal at all. He has flashbacks of the murder he has committed over the years and is still haunted by the memory of his mother. We get to see in black and white flashbacks scenes from Psycho II and of course, from the original Psycho. Norman still has the same hobbie taxidermy. His speciality are still birds. His life hasn't changed at all! He also peeps through holes in the wall. Our Norman still has the touch. Anyways, Mr. Bates is the same harmless looney until he meets the crazy ex nun (whose initials are M.C.) and quickly becomes obsessed with her because of the obvious resemblance to Marion Crane. Heck, she has even the same hair cut. The story centers on Norman and his weird interest in M.C. And how she starts to develop feelings for Norman. After the main plot is solved then the story moves on to quickly solve Norman's problem with his mother (which is an underrated scene in the genre in my opinion because Norman finally! takes action against her). Overall, this is a slow paced slasher flick. When this kind of flick gets boring then it's a failure. Psycho III doesn't offers anything you haven't seen except for a weird scene where Duke does some sort of sexual teasing act involving lamps. The strong part of the movie are the death scenes. Two of them are very gory and involve Norman's favorite weapon his butcher knife. The phone booth stabbing is my favorite death scene. Other victim dies because of a guitar smashed to his head and later being asphyxiated; another victim is stabbed Norman's style. The highlight of the movie is M.C.'s death. Check out the statue of Cupid before. Excellent scene. Perkin's directional debut is not that bad visually talking. He makes some very interesting camera angles and most of all, he knows how to create suspense. I wouldn't call Psycho III a stylish Horror movie because, frankly, it is rather mediocre even compared to 80's slasher standards. Special mention deserves the black humor in the movie. The crude black humor is perfectly used in some scenes and it adds a weird factor to the movie's events. Check out the scene where the police officer is munching ice cubes without realizing where he gets them from.The plot gets quickly boring and even Mr. Perkin's great performance can't hold the entire movie on it's back. Watch the movie for it's good death scenes and the thrilling ending. Not the last scene! Give it a try just because it's part of the Psycho franchise. In my opinion, part I and II should only be considered as part of the franchise. You can booth Bates Motel, part III, and IV to the trash can anytime.

Perkins is fairly successful in starring and directing the film, but the directing could have rather fallen into the hands of a professional director. Another problem is that spoofing on stuff could cause not only confusion, but also disgust in groups and individuals. Nudity, as seen in this film, is not worthy of the Psycho name, and Perkins probably had a great time filming these scenes. I'm glad for his part, but really, is it necessary? The violence is also of a more extreme nature than needed. Overall, this film isn't bad, but it doesn't even contend with its predecessors.

Then a disillusioned nun named Maureen Coyle (Diana Scarwid) who has lost her faith in God drifts into the motel & hires a room, that night Maureen tries to commit suicide by slitting her wrists but while delivering fresh towels to her room Norman gets to her in time & saves her life. Meanwhile nosey journalistic reporter Tracy Venable (Roberta Maxwell) becomes increasingly suspicious of Norman's behaviour & with Emma Spool still missing Tracy believes Norman is up to his old ways & becomes determined to prove it...The second sequel to Alfred Hitchcock's original Psycho (1960) I personally think Psycho III doesn't have that much going for it, Universal allowed Norman Bates himself Anthony Perkins to direct & star in this & to be fair he isn't the problem. No, it's the lacklustre script by Charles Edward Pogue. With Psycho II writer Tom Holland turned in a really clever, intricate psycho thriller with some genuine twist's & turns that will keep most viewers guessing right up until the very end & threw in just enough 80's exploitation like gore & nudity to make it fun. However for Psycho III you can forget about any clever narrative, any surprising twist's or any real mystery. It's far too obvious who the killer is & while Psycho II mercifully realised showing Anthony Perkins in drag dressed as his mother complete with wig would just not work & would look frankly ridiculous that's precisely what happens here in Psycho III. Anthony Perkins in drag is not scary or creepy or clever & to me feels very lazy in a 'lets have Norman as the killer because it's the easiest & simplest thing to do' sort of way. It's not a totally terrible film though, the pace is alright, there's some nice gore & nudity here, the character's are fine & some of the black humour & one liners are OK & even though it's a bit uninspired it does fit in quite well as a Psycho film.Apparently Perkins wanted to shoot Psycho III in black and white but Universal quite rightly told him to forget it. The ending was also the subject of some changing, Universal felt the ending was too weak & it needed more of a twist so Perkins was brought back in to shoot some moire footage although I am not sure where the film originally ended & what new footage was shot. It is also said that in the original script Duane Duke was the killer. There are one or two nice murders here including some stabbings & a cool slit throat. The film looks pretty good & Perkins does OK with some nice lighting, angles & shots.Production wise Psycho III looks pretty much the same as the previous two as again it's almost entirely set within the Bates Motel & it's grounds. The acting is alright, no-one really stands out for me here.Psycho III isn't as good as the previous two films but it ain't too bad when all things considered, worth a watch but it's lacking a little something overall I think.

Especially his film Psycho continues to stay the most imitated classic and, with the popularity of slasher-films in the 80's, this cinematic milestone got 'rewarded' with two totally unnecessary yet entertaining and blood-soaked sequels. Psycho II was a reasonably ambitious and cleverly plotted thriller whereas this third part is far more simplistic with gross killings, quite a lot of gratuitous nudity and unsurprising plot-twists. Business is very quiet in Bates Motel until the day Norman homes a runaway nun named Maureen, and she dangerously resembles the murdered Marion Crane. Especially when timid Norman starts to fall for Maureen's suicidal charms, his dominating mothers rears her jealous head again and starts another killing spree. The idea of supplying Norman Bates with a love-interest is nice, especially since the girl is quite nuts herself , and the first half of the film is actually rather atmospheric and tense. The opening shot revolving on Mareen's first and disastrous suicide attempt is even astonishing, despite being unrelated to the rest of the movie. There are several other sequences in which Anthony Perkins proves himself to be an adequate director and his subtle cinematographic tributes to Hitchcock are probably the film's biggest trumps. The murders mommy commits are typically 80's and thus repellent, gory and not caring much about the victim's identity. The set pieces are neat, the music occasionally is very unsettling and the acting performances are decent. Perkins even throws in some humor and witty dialogues, so I can't really say this sequel is a total failure.

The sequel was disappointing and this, 'Psycho 3', is the worst by far.  Honestly though, did we really think that the sequels would live up to the brilliantly done original? Norman Bates and the Bates motel are back yet again equipped with a low budget, a forgettable cast (all excluding the darling Anthony Perkins) and a plot in which a lot more should have been done.The only reason I even considered voting for 'Psycho 3' is that Perkins was the director.  (The vote wasn't too high but it was better than nothing.)  I love him, I adore him, he could have been a good director, but he shouldn't have come back to take charge of the second installment (third overall).Perkins is fairly good in the role that make him well known.  Once again, he is somewhat creepy, more so than what the role probably calls for, but hey, that's what makes him great.  And once again, a bad supporting cast is brought in to merely fill scenes in the picture that really don't have a whole lot to do with...anything.  I can't really recall who played what part or anything like that, I suppose because the performances were awful. The killings, the murders that take place are weird.  They sure have changed quite a lot from the original.  They just don't make 'em the way they used to.  Those were the good ole days.  In fact, most of those scenes made me laugh more than anything else.  Oh, that is bad.Like 'Psycho 2,'  'Psycho 3' creeps along at the same slow pace, if not slower.  Parts of it didn't piece together well and probably should have been left out during editing but if that had occurred, the total runtime would probably have been about eleven minutes and counting.'Psycho 3' is one to be passed on.  For those who skipped part two, I would recommend not going back to view it.  'Psycho' is the best, but these two films, made only to be recognized by the 'Psycho' name, don't amount to much.PS - I am very sorry, Anthony, that this film bombed, but what can I say, the script was bad but you were a fairly good director (while you were still around).

When it puts its mind to it, there is no subject, no person, no concept, no artifact that Hollywood can't debase. In this instance they've managed by dint of great effort and skill to take Hitchcock's 1960 classic and turn it into a schlock slasher movie.All the characters are by now either crazy or terminally stupid. The plot consists of unordered incidents unconnected by any logic that you or I might recognize.This remake, released twenty-six years after the original, was hobbled from the outset by the fact that there is no secret to speak of. We already know that Norman Bates is impersonating his dead, stuffed mother. Therefore, there is no mystery about the goings on except to the extent that we are puzzled at all about why this movie was ever made.Tony Perkins as Norman seems to have lost his taste for investing any acting skills in his performance. He was quite good in the original. He had a boyish, birdlike charm about him, an oddball candor, that elicited sympathy in a viewer, even one who knew how murderous he might be underneath that mask of sanity. Here, he's simply weird from the outset, his face aged in a way that has transformed that pale vulnerability into a darker menace. He reads his lines in a constant sing-song with no values. The script gives him a few in jokes that don't begin to compensate for the recklessness of its commercial blight. Diana Scarwid as the young woman who challenges Mother's dominance over Norman has done fine work elsewhere (eg., Silkwood) but here is shackled by the role of a half-nutty and unsuspecting failed nun who has tried to commit suicide in one of the motel's cabins, a fate from which she is rescued by Norman. That provides the material for one of the in jokes. Scarwid I must have left the bathroom a mess. Perkins I've seen worse. Points for the photography, though, which does a half-decent job of rendering the admirable set dressing in colors not nearly as lurid as the rest of the movie.But why go on? Hitchcock made a good, adult thriller. This is for ten-year-olds.

There are also a lot of  disgusting scenes such as the one where Norman is stuffing a bird with the same knife that uses to put Peanut butter to the cookies at the same time and when he kisses a corpse on the mouth. Norman meets the nun by accident and he initially thinks that she's Marion Crane. A group of young (and others not so young) people check in. It was predictable that many murders  FRIDAY THE 13th style would occur.This film is also a copy of the first one considering that imitates the effects (the falling-from-the-stairs sequence and the shower scene).
