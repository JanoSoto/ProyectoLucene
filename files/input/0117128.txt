The movie is almost exactly like the show, except shot on better film and with better effects. Jokes abound, and the victim is fairly awful. I thought they would have picked a worse movie to mock, though, as This Island Earth was a relatively harmless piece of 50's sci fi fluff. They have dealt with much more dangerous and evil pieces of celluloid than this one. But a good introduction for the novice Mystie. They can always find out about the horror that is Mandos later. The humor has recently been called juvenile and aimed at teenage boys, but I must disagree, as I am a 25 year old woman with a Master's degree in English and still find the show hilarious. The movie is only a taste of the overall genius that is (or was) MST, and if you at all liked the film, immediately go out and get what DVDs of the show are available. It's worth it.

The reason why the show is so loved is because it does what we always want to do or say during a really bad movie. So naturally the successful show that was created on Comedy Central wanted to do a movie about our favorite sarcastic robots. Was the movie a success? Not so much, but doesn't mean that this movie is bad at all, in fact, it's a great one to watch. My only disappointment? I think was just the fact that this was just like any other episode, there was nothing really too special about it to make it stand out as a movie. Secondly, I've seen funnier episodes than this movie. I'm not dissing the movie, because this is still completely worth the watch.Mike, Tom and Gypsy are startled to find Crow deep in the lower sections of the Satellite of Love, pounding at the hull with various digging instruments. He has convinced himself that he can tunnel back to Earth, he tells them. Checking his digging calculations, Crow discovers that he already knew this was inevitable Look at that, Breach Hull, All Die. Even had it underlined! They return to the Bridge, as Dr. Forrester announces that he is about to make them watch the 1955 classic sci-fi thriller This Island Earth in an attempt to break their wills. In Mystery Science Theater 3000 tradition, we are in for a good ride as they mock this silly clich√©d 50's sci fi film with no mercy.I do love the film that they picked This Island Earth, while in some sense it is a fun little sci fi classic, probably the first movie that I saw before I ever saw it on Mystery Science Theater 3000, it still is really cheesy and fun to make fun of. I just love at the end where the alien is trying to protect our two main characters away from the monster and for some odd reason he just lightly blocks the two people away from the monster as Mike points out ACTING!, lol! Obviously fans of the show are going to see this movie, it's a little girt to the fans I think in some sense, I wish they had a few more cameos and could've gone a little bigger, but it's all good. For those who don't know the premise of the show, this is a funny movie, the people that I've introduced the show too have mixed reviews, a few loved it a few didn't really like it, so it's one of those movies you'll have to decide for yourself.9/10 "},{"Title":"It may be simple...

Have you ever watched a lousy flick with friends and improvised dialogue for the actors or make remarks in jest about how stupid the film is? Have you ever wondered what happens to the other sock? If you answered yes, you will enjoy Mystery Science Theater 3000 The Movie.The premise is that the evil Dr. Forrester is subjecting Mike Nelson and his robot companions Tom Servo and Crow to some of the worst films of all time, as part of a plot to beat the world into submission. Yeah, this premise is pretty weak in itself, but the commentary from these three is what you'll be hooked by.What this intrepid trio does best is make fun of stinky celluloid for the audience's amusement. They do the unimaginable; they make an utter piece of trash not only watchable, but hilarious. It's open season on ridiculous movies, and the film is merely a showcase of their regular television program of the same name. The film has been my first exposure to the show, which has selected episodes available on tape. Sadly, the show is not broadcast in my area, and sadder still is the news that the series will conclude this year. The unfortunate aspect of this is that I do have a sense of what I'm missing. It's a great concept, and has proven to be popular with many viewers.The film for the mocking is This Island Earth. A particularly cheesy selection that can actually be found on DVD in its original format without the hilarious commentary. Some people regard it as a sci-fi classic, but it's essentially been brought to better light with the help of the MST3K team. No one is safe. They even mock their own credits. Watch this one with friends if you can; it's really well done.

And the movie is very funny and good and you should see it.That said...Mystery Science Theater 3000 The Movie (hereafter called MST3KTM for time-saving purposes) could of been a LOT better than it was, and it's NOT the fault of the folks at Best Brains, Inc. (The production company that made the TV show, hereafter called BBI).  I place the blame entirely on the fine (HA!) folks at Universal, who forced several changes to the movie and it's wonderful riffing, forcing the folks at BBI to dumb down their product, mess with their tried-and-true break format, and shoot an entirely different (and stupid, compared to the original) ending, as well as trimming it down to 74 minutes (because at 88, it was TOO LONG! As Servo would say ...the HELL?) When you come right down to it, BBI makes MST3K one way, and the studio told them to do it a different way. And ANY other way is the WRONG way! I really wish that BBI had held out for an offer with more creative control, but if ifs and buts were candy and nuts, etc. I don't blame BBI for taking the offer, but the selfish part of me would of rather the film never got made than compromised so radically. Then the realist in me tells me to be grateful that it DID get made, and succeeds (somewhat) in spite of (and believe me, not BECAUSE of) the restrictions placed on it. 4 stars to the fine folks at BBI, -1,000 stars to Universal, 2 1/2 stars to the movie itself.

If you, the viewer, are not familiar with Mystery Science Theater 3000, better known as MST3K, I recommend that you rent/buy/borrow, beg, or steal tapes to become a tad familiar with the concept.The concept is  riffing a B-or-worse-scifi-movie; the victim, er-- subject, in this case, is This Island Earth, a classic from the 50's.  There's this guy (Mike) who's been shot up to an orbiting space station (the Satellite of Love, or SOL) by a Mad Scientist (Dr. Clayton Forrester).  Mike is a replacement test subject (Joel, who made the robots for companionship, escaped), and he and Joel's 'bots (short for ro-bots) ease the stress of being test subjects by making wise@$$ remarks while the movie is running. Then there are little interval segments that attempt to tell a coherent narrative.The catch is that the bots are actually only puppets made from a gumball machine head, salad bowl, Tupperware interlocking set of flower vases, and armatures from folding adjustable desk lamps.  The original actor who voices Crow T. Robot is Trace Beaulieu, who also plays Dr. Forrester (ah, the magic of motion pictures!).  The guy who voices Tom Servo is Kevin Murphy-- well, if you really want to see him, you'll have to find the episodes on tape and go looking for his appearances as other characters.This movie is much better than the episodes that have appeared either on Comedy Central or the Sci-Fi Channel, primarily because Best Brains, the production company, had more money to make better sets, props, and better staging of gags.  The Hubble was great, as was the amusing and embarrassing segment where Dr. Forrester ends up in the Metalunan guy's shower. aaagghhh!!!The only two things I miss are Joel Hodgson, who was the original host, and Frank Conniff, who played Dr. Forrester's assistant, TV's Frank.  Joel was a much different test subject than Mike-- Joel was more introspective, did many more musical bits on the show, was more creative Invention Exchange was Joel's idea; as a comic/magician, he made most of the bizarre and funny inventions on the show.  I feel that Joel's presence, as writer and actor, would have given a tighter, more coherent slant to the experiment (but then, again, I could be biased!).Frank Conniff, as TV's Frank, was the best inept sidekick an inept Mad Scientist could have, and Frank was the perfect foil for Forrester.  Their gags tended to be more physical, slapstick comedy.But MST3K The Movie is, I hope, the first in a long line of franchise movies (like Star Trek The Motion Picture!).  I hope that Best Brains, Inc. does another MST3K movie--it's like no-calorie chocolate!!!

I mean, there's barely any profanity, drug references, and such. But the film being toned down was never the intention in the first place. You see, the company Gramercy Pictures simply forced those intentions onto Best Brains, the company that produces the show and the movie itself. In fact, here's some interesting trivia making the film was not a happy experience for the filmmakers, due to frequent studio interference. Years later, at a cast reunion appearance in New York City, Trace Beaulieu was asked what the worst movie featured on MST3K was. His reply was, you guessed it, Mystery Science Theater 3000 The Movie.But I'll get back to that later. Anyway, the film is about well as usual that Mike and the Robots are doomed to watch bad movies but something a little different happens. You see, Mike, Tom and Gypsy are startled to find Crow deep in the lower sections of the Satellite of Love (The spaceship) pounding at the hull with various digging instruments. He has convinced himself that he can tunnel back to Earth, he tells them. A hull breach soon follows (Checking his digging calculations, a confused Crow discovers that he already knew this was inevitable Look at that, Breach Hull, All Die. Even had it underlined!), which Tom Servo remedies in an unexpected way.But as soon as they get back to the bridge, Dr. Clayton Forrester has them watching a film called This Island Earth. So, they end up riffing the film as they always do with other films.Now I like to point out the good things about the film, it does show for the first time ever other parts of the show (I personally laughed at the Mike on the mouse wheel scene, funny stuff), the characters mocking the film, those are always the best parts and of course, an explanation as to what happened to Dr. Clayton Forrester before Pearl took over as the villain for the rest of the series and the infamous end credits riffing. But despite those aspects, I still didn't like it. I mean, it wasn't as funny as the TV show as it was toned down to a family friendly level which I despise a lot. I mean, why tone down something that wasn't made to be family friendly in the first place?

After being a rabid fan of the show for several years, a feature film version was a mind-blowing possibility that I couldn't wait for. Of course, it only played major cities for about two weeks, then quietly plopped onto video store shelves, where I finally got to pay to see it. I've got to admit, I wasn't that crazy about it. In fact, it seems that Best Brains was engulfed and dominated by a overly-elaborate, poorly-planned studio mentality that couldn't grasp the concept of the show. MST3K is about a good natured temp worker (Michael J. Nelson) who is stranded on a spaceship with witty robots and is forced to watch bizarre and awful movies by a demented scientist. The fact that the bulk of the show is showing movies, translating the concept to a theatrical presentation seems like it should be no problem. The film they chose to riff, `This Island Earth', was a perfect choice. It has great production values and would look great back on the big screen, with crisp imagery and competent special effects. Despite it's technical competence, though, it's saddled with some ridiculous dialog, rock-stupid heroes, dumb situations, unbelievable plot twists, and a really silly/cool rubber monster. What's not to love?But for some damn reason, the movie was edited for it's use in `MST3K The Movie'. Now `This Island Earth' seems rushed and worse than it really is. They delete a scene where Cal (the big, dumb scientist played by Rex Reason) breaks more equipment, making their later jokes about Cal's clumsiness sort of strange, as we only see him break one thing. These cuts also create a continuity gaffe, as Ruth's dress changes from one shot to another. After all the cuts, `MST3K The Movie' is actually shorter than the un-MSTied `This Island Earth', even shorter than an episode of the MST3K TV show- without commercials! What the Hell?So the movie segments are disappointing, but still really funny (despite the wisecracks being less esoteric and frequent then on the TV show). Then there's the host segments.  There's a good introduction by the great Dr. Forrester (Trace Beaulieu), but the rest of the host segments are overly simple and childish, lacking clever word play and gags. They were able to use different angles and cuts within scenes (unlike the TV show), but this seems to hinder the writer's imaginations rather than embellish it.  In these scenes, none of the characters get any good lines or comedic sequences, and Tom Servo (Kevin Murphy) and Crow (Beaulieu again) become interchangeable, colorless characters.  What the Hell?Perhaps I am being overly harsh on this movie because I love the television show so much. I didn't hate the movie, in fact, there is much to recommend. The movie segments are hilarious, and the show's colorful toy-store sets adapt well to the big screen (in theory, I mean, I never got to see it on the big screen).  It's just is distressing to think that many people's introduction to the world of MST3K was this watered down version.I pray that Universal gets around to releasing a special edition of this movie. There were a few cut host segments, including an alternate ending, that would be interesting to see. Plus, they could show the entire, uncut `This Island Earth', giving the strongest point of `MST3K The Movie', the movie-mocking, more screen time. But in the mean time- what the Hell?!?!?

Still, the riffing was good and the film overall funny, just not as good as some of the stuff one saw in the regular show. In this film the Satellite of Love looks like it is in space, other than that it seems there was very little need to make this movie as the producers seemed to want to make this film short as all get out, it would of been better off simply being an episode of the show. The film being parodied is This Island Earth, a film I have not seen other than what is presented here. Usually I feel comfortable reviewing films the gang have done, but this one is so obviously cut short I will not review this one as this one is so chopped up a lot of the plot is too. I am not sure what is happening in places so until I see the full movie I will not review it. I can review this though and like I said, it is good, but I would rather they had stayed on television as this movie is shorter than anything they did on the show on Comedy Central or the Sci-Fi channel. The host segments were not as funny as the host segments on the regular show either as they seemed to want to scream at the audience, This is a movie! So overall, funny, just kind of pointless.

The guys are subjected to This Island Earth by the familiar Dr. Forrester. In between the condensed movie, there are 5 sketches. Dr. Forrester's mad-scientist soliloquy & Crow drilling a hole to the Earth can be considered the first part. When the film melts and breaks is part two. There are two interocitor sketches and the credits.Dr. Cal Meacham is a gifted and important atomic scientist. So important that Lockheed lets him commute to work in one of their vehicles. A commute to work is flying a jet from DC to somewhere across the country. As Cal arrives at work the plane malfunctions, but (thankfully) he is saved by a mysterious and pulsating green glow. At work, more strange things appear. This time an ordering mishap occurs, giving Cal a capacitor of incredible specifications. A delivery of a metal-page catalog arrives and continues the strangeness, which ultimately leads to an ordering spree and the creation of an interocitor.Next, a strange white-haired man, named Exeter, appears on the interocitor & reveals all. He admits that the catalog, the parts & their assembly were a test to verify his aptitude. Exeter is a recruiter for a scientific think-tank. Cal can't resist and ends up at a utopian-like mansion full of the world's best scientists. Some typical snooping later, the development of a love interest (Dr. Ruth, if only it were her) & the Professor's help, lead to the truth; Exeter is an alien and they are going to his home planet of Metaluna, with Cal & Ruth tagging along. BIG Surprise, right? No. Not at all actually. HELLO!. There are aliens on the movie posters even before you would have walked into the theater.I remember seeing this movie as a child on AMC on a Saturday afternoon. It was one of the first science fiction movies that had better than average production value and a plot line that was a bit more than an alien-western or alien-horror story. It's not perfect and it isn't Forbidden Planet (the overall best sci-fi movie of the 50's; story, special effects,etc.) either, but it is fast paced and enjoyable. Most sci-fi of the time is about an alien out to destroy us & our attempts to stop them. This Island Earth adds a small layer of actual science, some sympathetic extraterrestrials and colorful special effects to create something worth remembering. There are genuine attempts at science fiction here, restricted by the budget, studios and audience perception of the genre. Don't expect 2001 A Space Odyssey, but it's not Plan 9 from Outer Space either.This is by far the best production value of anything with Mystery Science Theater 3000 on it. The sets, models and robots look great. One of the funniest parodies of the series comes out of this the Normal View scene. I enjoyed it so much that I made it my ringer. There is a strange echo,however, that accompanies all the sketches, but that can be explained. This contributes to the the most pasteurized version of the show ever. It feels a little hollow. Frank and the opening credits, which were important to the series, are sadly missing here. The guys even do the credits for their own movie and in the end, it is still MST3k and it is still fun. You just have some regret of how much more amazing it could have been.-Celluloid Rehab "},{"Title":"Pure Genius!","Date":"24 November 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Sci-Fi","Review":" I have been a fan of MST3K for quite some time, since I was 9.

Taking a television show and putting it up on the big screen in an almost unaltered format, that's a little more unique, but somehow it works for this cult classic.I grew up watching MST3K, as it inspired most of my humor and love of cheesy movies. The show takes the whole premise of Mike, Tom Servo and Crow and puts them up on the big screen to simply do their thing. They aren't given a contrived plot, an epic story, or even an origin... they just make fun of a film. The actual audience actually pays to watch an older sci-fi movie that is heckled by an on screen audience. It's ludicrous and brilliant all at once.The chosen film This Island Earth, isn't a bad film. It's dated, and some of the concepts are silly by today's standards, but not really a clunker of a film like Manos The Hands of Fate, Mitchell, or Overdrawn at the Memory Bank. But Mike and the bots riff away as they always did before, adding some classic lines, and pausing every few minutes in an attempt to escape the Satellite of Love, or annoy Dr. Forrester.The budget for the movie is a little better, but not by much. But expecting elaborate sets from a show like this is like expecting gas prices to drop anytime soon. And for the fanbase, it's what one would expect from the characters. Putting them in a contrived situation for a movie plot's sake might have had the guys riffing their own film somewhere down the line. The strength of the film remains in the show's writing and biting sarcasm of anything happening on screen.The downsides of the film are the fact that the cut down the overall run time of This Island Earth as they would in the show, which didn't make sense as movies in the theater don't have commercial breaks (well, not yet, anyway). And I would have enjoyed seeing a short before the actual film, as those were some of the best gems of the entire series.The film didn't have a huge release, and finding a copy of the out of print DVD is a hard task in itself, but the movie caters to the fans, and in that respect does not disappoint. Anyone else may or may not get it, but the endless barrage of one-liners still remain funny.

The opening credits of This Island Earth are starting, and a title card reads A Universal-International Picture. At this point Mike Nelson intones Doesn't the fact that it's universal make it international? The line epitomizes the irreverence and style one can expect from the hundreds of other one-liners that will be tossed out over the next hour and a half. Nothing in a movie is more taken for granted than a credit sequence, but then again nothing is beyond the notice of our test subjects. It is also a good example of their Midwestern style of humor, which is a mix of dry sarcasm, wry sophistication, and a sincere desire to not offend. The last of these is probably the key to appreciating what Mike and the Bots are doing. The idea is not to ridicule another person's life's work, as some have contended, the idea is to make the best of a bad situation (i.e., the movie). Once that spirit is accepted, the movie surrounding the movie can be appreciated in the gentle good humor that it's intended.Above all, the creators of MST3K are fans of movies and, just like southern comedians who constantly rip on the South, they see all the weaknesses just as well as the strengths.

It's a solid 50s sci-fi film that I would rate a 7/10 on its own. I would have thought that for Mystery Science Theater 3000 The Movie, the producers would have selected something much worse than this. And why cut This Island Earth? Here again the producers picked the wrong movie. If they were going to turn a 90 minute television show (without commercials) into a 73 minute movie, why pick This Island Earth and its 87 minute runtime? There are plenty of really bad movie with a runtime of right at an hour. Finally, Mystery Science Theater 3000 The Movie lacks to flow found in the television show. I've read that the director slowed down the pace of the movie riffing so theater audiences wouldn't miss anything while laughing.

Alas, any kind of character development (yes, the original show DID develop their characters) is rendered impossible by the curiously short running time of 75 minutes, far less than an average episode.Said time restriction also caused them to essentially cut This Island Earth, of which little over 50 minutes remain, to shreds. Then again, the much-beloved classic was hardly the perfect choice for the MST3K treatment anyway; I'd have picked something like Irving Allen's The Swarm &#150; great to look at, simple to trim to a manageable length, and full of hilarious ridiculousness, both in dialogue, plot and effects.

I am as obsessed with this show as the other fans but I got into the whole deal rather late.  At the video store I thought that the tape of MST3Kthe movie was a good deal at only $9.  That started my descent into madness. Now I have bought all the tapes of the TV series released by Rhino and compulsively, regularly watch them. So you can see that I am rather a newbie to the series, especially since I can't see it on the SciFi channel cause I don't get cable.  However, I can tell that the TV series is far superior.  This does not knock the movie in any way.  It is just that This Island Earth in not THAT bizarre of a movie. It definitely is not in the hideous league of Robot Monster.  I even heard it was one of the best and most realistic alien movies of the 50s(!) and that This Island Earth fans hate MST3K for making fun of it.  Still, time has surely made a difference regarding This Island Earth (unlike the timeless classic, 2001 A Space Odyssey).  The hero was just to macho and deep-voiced to be believable.  The friendly alien is just too goofy.  No one even notices the aliens huge foreheads for quite a while.  Also, too much was cut from the original movie. If there are any MST3K guys that don't know this listen up!  You know that delivery man that gives Joe the packaged Interositer handbook. Guess who that guy is.  COLEMAN FRANCIS!!  Yes, the incredibly inept actor/director from Red Zone Cuba, an MST3K classic.

However Nelson and his robot friends appear to take it all in their stride and are more concerned about how they can pilot the ship they are trapped on back to earth.I have never heard of the TV series from which this came but was attracted to this by the unusual title.  When I started it I was put off by the corny acting and horrid cheap effects in the first 10 minutes or so and wondered `wtf have I taped?', but I stuck with it.  Once the viewing of `This Island Earth' starts, then the film really picks up.  It only drops when the viewers leave the cinema and pick up some sort of plot of trying to pilot their ship back to earth.For information I don't think This Island Earth is that good a film, but I certainly don't think it is the worst or cheesiest of the many sci-fi films made in the period, but it is certainly an easy target for the film.  To describe this movie, it can only be thought of as an evening in with friends, beer and wise cracks.  Basically the viewers sit and wise crack all the way through it.  If you are a fan of This Island Earth then it is probably akin to being in hell, but for everyone else it seems quite funny.I admit that the idea of people talking all the way through a film is unappealing to me but, once I got into the mood, I couldn't stop laughing. It is all very silly and I can see why this film never made it to UK cinemas (and took 7 years to reach UK tv) but it is funny.  And, because it is scripted, the wise cracks know what is coming and can be based on that! If you like silly smart-assed humour then this is for you, otherwise it is probably best avoided.  For me I loved it and will watch it again simply for the line where Exeter says `our people are looking for leading scientists' only to have one of the robots blurt out `you know any' - and other silly lines.While none of this sounds great, I was kept laughing simply because the jokes keep coming all the way through it - even though some miss the next one is never far off.  The effect of watching a film with a running commentary seems annoying but most of us will have done it on DVD.  So ignore the rubbish bits which go on outside of the film viewing and enjoy This Island Earth with an astronaut and a couple of smart mouthed robots!

Stuck on the station with no way home, and basically enduring bad films at the whims of Forrester, our trio tries to keep their sanity intact and hope for eventual escape at some point. With a theatre and the trio silhouetted in front of whatever film they must sit through, Mike, Servo, and Crow offer constant jokes and zingers about the content presented before them. Most of the films that showed up on the show were really, really lousy. Manos, the Hands of Fate and The Creeping Terror were two popular examples, but I just don't think This Island Earth deserved the distinction of being in their company. Still, I laughed a good bit (it really is hard to laugh out loud at something for any longer than seconds before the next zinger comes), and there were openings here and there for them (Casablanca, Gilligan's Island, Salvador Dali, Tangerine Dream, Dr. Seuss, and other pop culture items find their place in the comedy of the trio), but I'm certain plenty of rotten apples were out there far more fitting for lampoonery than This Island Earth. The segments about the aliens from Metaluna (their foreheads, bleach-blond hair, and communication device (that could also shoot laser beams)) were ripe for comedy, but the rest break sequences (mostly concerning Mike, Servo, and Crow trying to come up with a means to get off the station and home) are not quite as strong although everyone involved tries valiantly to do so. All in all, I think the show really didn't leap off the screen to me as something that required a theatrical movie. It seems right at home on cable (or preferably, cable access), and that seems to be where it belongs. It is a show that has a mixed reaction. Some can't stand the nerve of people to take films and hurl jokes at them to amuse themselves and possibly others who might share their sense of humor (often very cinephile and film nerd, while also quite drenched in pop culture of all kinds, including consumer goods and music), while another party of viewers will indeed bask in the delight that comes with taking the bad (dreck that lives on the public domain) and applying comedy to it. So, this movie (and the show that spawned it) will either repulse or entertain. I think this is the case of if you are a fan, this will be enjoyable to you (but, surprisingly, not quite as good as the show during its run at the time); the movie is a chance to be lax on language (curse words were included in the humor at times), with some more adult humor allowed to find its way into the jokes. If you never liked the show, I can't imagine you'll enjoy this movie. I think why this isn't as good as the show, ultimately, is because there's that bit of charm lost (maybe because it was under studio rule?) and that lo-tech spirit seems a bit subdued. But, for me, it was still a good deal of fun.

This is meant to torture the trio but the three turn the tables with their comments. I will admit right up front that I'm not one of the die hard fans who love this show more than anything else. I'm very hit and miss on it and I often find myself on message boards talking against the show because I'm one who can enjoy these bad movies without the added comments. However, every time I argue against the show it hits me that when I do watch one I find it funny and there's no question that there's talent behind the comments. Now, I will say that I found it strange that they selected THIS ISLAND EARTH for their first movie because, to be honest, it's really not a bad movie. I think had they selected a worse movie it might have led to more and better jokes but what's here is still pretty good. I thought the best moments happened whenever the trio went on with continued dialogue. One would pretend to be the voice of a character and then they would just go back and forth. I thought this is when the best jokes came out and especially the stuff dealing with the alien leader's ultra big head. Another funny jokes happens at the start when the plane is about to crash but the alien's help land it with a green flashing light. The jokes that are around this are very good. As with any comedy, there are jokes that don't work but I think for the most part the majority of them hit their target and deliver laughs.

This time, the film is This Island Earth.This film is very funny, but there is really nothing I have to say about it. If you like the show, you will like the movie, because there is really no difference whatsoever. The budget is slightly greater, so the lobby jokes are nicer looking, but they are so minor that it hardly matters. The picture quality also seems slightly crisper. The bulk of the film has them in the theater, which would look the same no matter what.Sadly, the film does little more than make me miss the show. According to some unknown source, The TV show's usual density of gags was reduced for theatrical audiences, so that a larger number of people laughing wouldn't cause too much dialogue to be missed. That makes sense, except when you are watching it sixteen years later on DVD. You do not need that much silence -- it then becomes almost like really watching This Island Earth.Even more mysterious, the film comes in at a short 73 minutes, even shorter than the average episode of 90 minutes. So the movie is shorter than the TV show! And the disc has no special features (besides French language track), so the DVD is not that special -- you would be better off buying a DVD of them watching Manos or something, unless you really enjoyed this particular film.A good film, some funny gags, and a short run time for quick viewing... but really nothing worth making a movie about.

I believe it was state of the art for its time. Just the same, it did leave itself to some reality checks like the one liner in this summary(possible spoilers) chimed in response to Exedor's comment that the bars Cal & Ruth were stuck to were magnetised.    Though the moveis viewed in the series episodes seemed to be much more corny, I must say that one of the main things I found so funny about the heckling & improvising is the way that it contrasted so much as 90's tolerated dialogue juxtaposed against the straight-laced 50's dialogue of the movie. I reserve comment as to whether the change over time is progress or moral decline, but the mixing of the 2 is a hilarious contrast. That's why I like the fact that the wisecracks sounded like they were on the same sound track. Many of the lines were not particularly funny in & of themselves. But the fact that they were interposed into an era that wouldn't have touched the subject matter made them funny.  For example, Cal was telling his assistant Joe about his all night pondering as to whether or not to take Exedor up on his offer. He said he went through 5 cups of coffee before saying to himself-..I gotta pee! interrupted one of the robots finishing his sentence for him. Also, I knew Russel Johnson was in this, & I knew Professor Jokes were inevitable. Looking back, though they did roll in, it's surprising how constrained they were, apparantly careful not to milk a joke for more than it's worth.  Any criticising of the cartoony nature about the way the robots & Mike Nelson & Forrester behaived should be balanced by realising that nobody in this makes any pretence of expecting to be taken seriously. Also, I can only have so much sympathy for Rex Reason & the other actors in TIE. You would have a hard time convincing me that they didn't do their share of hilarious pratfalls & out-takes during shooting & rehearsals just to get it out of their system. The straighter the script, the greater the comic tension. Maybe not, but don't hold your breath. Anyway, guess I betterauger this baby in.

Instead of having Burger World's Dickheads of the Month unspooling wisecracks over Cinderalla and Warrant video clips, you have two androids, Gypsy and Crow, and their human pal, Michael J Nelson, unspooling wisecracks over an endless stream of horrendous Z-grade films. They are held captive aboard a bone-shaped space vessel by an evil scientist, Dr Clayton Forrester (Trace Beaulie who also co-wrote the script), who plans to conquer the world by exposing Earthlings to celluloid crap and, in the movie, the choice of deconstruction is the 1954 sci-fi schlocker, This Island Earth. No household names with eye-candy looks, no costly visual trickery and certainly not much of a plot, MST-3K has less to do with science-fiction than the cannibalisation of popular culture; their gleeful nitpicks are peppered with a litany of pop culture references from The Addams Family and Top Gun, to Kate Moss, the Matsushita Corporation and even William Shatner.

I saw this movie in a tiny theater in downtown Madison, Wisconsin. Just being around other MSTies and laughing together at this extension of the show we all loved was a thrilling experience. Since then, I have watched this movie so many times that I have most of it memorized. There is no doubt that some of the jokes are tamer and some of the humour is not quite up to the par of the show; this is all because of the big studio that was marketing the movie. Apparently, many of the jokes were considered too obscure for audiences and the original ending was cut. The big money-grubbing studio that took over control of this movie must have decided that we weren't smart enough to handle all of these in-jokes. All they did was take away one of the main reasons people love this show. The more obscure the comment, the funnier it is if you understand it; if you don't understand it now, there's always the chance of discovery later. What I hate most is that major control over this movie was literally taken away from the creative geniuses who best know the show. As great as this movie is, I know that it could have been better if Best Brains had been allowed to retain complete control over THEIR movie. All complaints aside, this movie is still one of the best motion pictures ever made in my opinion. The wit and creativity of Mike Nelson and Co. still shines through in all of the skits and movie segments. The movie This Island Earth was an excellent choice for ribbing. As a very colorful movie to begin with, it afforded endless oppurtunities for quipping. One thing I don't understand is the fact that, at one point in the movie, Ruth's dress changes between two scenes that are supposed to be minutes apart, and Mike and the 'bots don't say anything about it. This isn't something that would normally slip by these guys so I guess we can just chalk that one up to bad editing. True, the movie may not be as funny or as well-acted as such classic episodes as Pod People or The Day the Earth Froze, but it is still a blast to watch, and offers no end of quoteable lines. A must-see if you're a die-hard fan, a casual viewer, or haven't yet been introduced to the wonderful world of Deep 13 and the SOL.

From Agent for H.A.R.M. to Time Chasers to Prince of Space, the boys from the Satellite of Love do an excellent job of what everyone in their right mind has always wanted to do- freely mock horrible movies, and get PAID for it.  With the cancellation of the series in 2000, I find myself having to mock bad movies on my own.  And I'm not nearly as good at it. MST3k, as I said, was an excellent series.  From their actual movie-mocking to the skits they'd put on between segments, the show was straight out hilarious, always constructed in just the right way. The movie version, unfortunately, falls just a bit short of the norm.  It's still good, the skits in particular being insanely funny, but it somehow seems a bit off.  I find myself thinking that the good folks on the show were a bit too stressed about this being a movie, and were just not up to their usual feel-good level.  On the whole, it seems rushed- This Island Earth, the movie in question, doesn't seem to take as much abuse as most of the films on the tv version of the show, as though the MST3k guys were being too careful, trying to avoid offending anyone that might like the film.  A great number of the jokes involve the special effects of the day, something they usually avoid with good reason.  After all, many times the special effects are the best that could be done at the time, and the show was made to mock movies that just didn't try, not ones that did.  This Island Earth is widely regarded as a real classic, and it seems like it really was a step above the usual movies MST3k mocks.  While that's not to say that there isn't anything funny in the movie segments, they just aren't as good as they usually are, consisting mainly of the previously mentioned special effects jokes and Star Trek references, with better jokes on the acting or plot coming far less often than in the TV series.  The mocking of the MST3k credits is actually funnier than the rest of the movie segments. Still, the MST3k movie is easily worth watching.  It's a good introduction to the series, and the skits (particularly Mike broke the Hubble) are lots of fun.  If you're looking for the best they can do, though, this isn't it.

No matter, they did a fine job with the new ending. You don't even have to be a fan to like this movie, it's great fun for all. Okay, so the host segments weren't quite like the ones in the TV series, but they were just as good. I have no favorite part, I love the whole film. Even the most straight faced bore on Earth will crack a smile during this, and who couldn't laugh at the jokes about Rando at the end? This Island Earth wasn't that good to begin with, although the plot about aliens needing help was somewhat original for the time it was made. They couldn't have done a better job. Who says this isn't as funny as the show? It's every bit as funny! And it's even shorter than an episode! A great, great, great film, totally hilarious.

Maybe it's the fact that I have seen the movie numerous times, and the jokes just don't effect me the same way anymore. Or maybe it's the fact that some of the jokes are just not top-of-the-game material. But they are still kind of funny.Somehow it just feels like their hearts were really not into the making if this movie. Maybe Universal forced them to have to do this movie, I don't know. But I do get the strong since of something like this happening around Universal. The jokes really do feel like they were screened by Universal and had to be okayed before being done. The acting is just like it is in the show, which is not bad.The cast all do good. Trace returns again as the demented Clayton Forester, though without TV's Frank this time(?) We get to hear him return as the voice of Crow again. Mike is....Mike...His goofy humor really pushes the movie along in a good direction. Kevin Murphy does great -- as always -- as the voice of Servo. We get a new(and not too great in my opinion) door sequence. I don't know why they did not just keep the original Mike era door sequence. The other thing about the door sequence is they only show the fool run of it once. The next couple of times we start off on the second-to-last door.All in all, this movie is not too bad. If you have not seen it and are a fan of the show, you will like this movie.

'Mystery Science Theater 3000 The Movie' tries to fulfill fan expectations without alienating newcomers, and it doesn't quite succeed.I know that many have complained about the choice of the sci-fi classic 'This Island Earth' as a target here, but that objection doesn't make much sense--really, folks, there are very few films that are simply too good to be poked fun of, and 'This Island Earth' certainly isn't one of them, even if it doesn't live down to MST3K's usual standard.No, the problem is largely one of rhythm. The charm of the TV show has always been its overloaded quality, with the snarky armchair wits keeping the jabs and pop-culture references flying so fast that the bomb-to-laugh ratio always stays relatively low. Not so with the bigscreen version, where the stream of jokes was apparently slowed down to accommodate audience laughter in the cinema. On video, you can really feel that, and it hurts the pace terribly. The 'linking' material feels redundant to the initiated, and isn't likely to impress the novice viewer much.Still, many of the jokes that are there do work, and the overall effect is one of rather weak episode of the TV show. Of course, that's going to appeal more to some people than others, so fanboys and newbies alike should consider themselves warned. 6.5 out of 10.

This is one of them.The best heckling sessions are spontaneous.  They come about when a group of people sit down in an honest attempt to enjoy a movie and find their efforts frustrated by the movie's jaw-dropping awfulness.  This Island Earth, while admittedly no masterpiece, looks (from what we can see of it here) to be reasonably well produced, NOT utterly moronic in conception, and far above the level of jaw-dropping awfulness required - unlike the linking segments shot for this film, which have all the frenetic, forced goofiness of an infantile Saturday morning cartoon show.  Besides, the hecklers never even gave This Island Earth a chance they let loose with the wisecracks the INSTANT the opening credits hit the screen.  Whatever else may be wrong with the rest of the movie, there's nothing wrong, surely, with the opening credits.Most of the wisecracks are, it turns out, funny, which is one of two reasons the exercise is not a total loss.  But few of the jokes are as funny in practise as they are in principle.  Something about the way they're superimposed on top of the original soundtrack - the way the 1996 movie has been superimposed on the 1954 one, so that we're sort of watching both at once - prevents the comic timing from being exactly right except by accident.  Jokes far weaker than these could have been made far funnier if the original soundtrack had been completely replaced, as Woody Allen did with a cheap Japanese movie for What's Up, Tiger Lily?  (1966).  (Which I haven't seen.  I have seen the 1993 Australian movie Hercules Returns, though, which is hilarious.)  Such an approach requires skill; you cannot take any old wisecrack that occurs to you and throw it in, for it may destroy the overall story; nor can you spend your time making mean-spirited fun of the earlier film, since you are, so to speak, melting it down to make something genuinely new.I said there are two reasons this film isn't a total loss.  The second one is based on a mere possibility the chance that this production and others like it will encourage Hollywood studios to invest more money in properly restoring their old titles.
