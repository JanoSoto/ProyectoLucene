[{"Title":"Poignant and powerful","Date":"19 August 2000","Score":"73 out of 85 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  Nineteen ninety-nine was an outstanding year for adaptations of major literary works, but of all the great books that came to the screen last year, this is my favorite.  John Irving's novel and adaptation is one of the most complete stories I can remember in many years.  It is poignant, exhilarating, and astutely human in its scope, presenting a myriad of human emotions and experiences.Often, when a story attempts to cross genres so broadly, it fails from lack of depth or insufficiency of the writer or director to meet the variable demands of such a wide-ranging treatment.  This film was a comedy, a tragedy, a romance, a human-interest story, a character study, and a period piece, and each element was excellently done.This was all accomplished without sacrificing the philosophical and emotional depth Irving imbues in all his works.  Irving weaves a strong moral into this story; that rules need to be questioned and that being human is not so easily codified.  He revisits this theme repeatedly, with each character facing dilemmas regarding societal and personal rules that are difficult to reconcile in the given situations.If there is one thing that stands out about this story, it is its human realism.  These are ordinary people struggling with problems we all face.  We come to have affection for almost all of them, and can identify with their tribulations.  Although the story is excessively sentimental and fatalistic, it reminds us that life is complicated and doesn't always turn out the way we plan or hope. From a filmmaking perspective, we could not have asked more from Lasse Hallstrom.  Known most in the U.S. for his direction of &#145;What's Eating Gilbert Grape', Hallstrom has been making wonderful films in Europe for almost twenty years.  However, this film will certainly go down as his finest work.  In the featurette on the DVD, he said that when he goes to Blockbuster with his daughter and sees it on the shelf, he will have a feeling of pride; and well he should.This motion picture was beautifully filmed with rich cinematography, breathtaking locations, and precise period props and costumes.  However, the greatest achievement for Hallstrom, working in concert with Irving, was to orchestrate a large cast in such a way that no character seemed insignificant.  Hallstrom took great care to do enough development of each character (often just visually without any dialogue) that he made us care for each of them.  He gave the film an emotional depth and breadth that is difficult to achieve in two hours.  His work with the children in the orphanage was superb, bringing forth their innocence and enthusiasm without minimizing their plight.The acting was uniformly outstanding.  Tobey Maguire infused Homer with the right combination of idealism, naiveté and inner strength to make him an unassuming but powerful lead.  Charlize Theron continues to impress me with her acting ability.  Besides her enchanting girl-next-door attractiveness, she showed terrific range in a character that at first seemed shallow, but later proved to be quite complex.Michael Caine has had a legendary career spanning close to half a century.  He has long been one of my favorite actors.  His performance here was powerful and well deserving of the acclaim he received.  Dr. Larch was an extremely complex character; egotistical, self-abusive, manipulative and recalcitrant, yet a saintly, self-sacrificing and loving crusader for the good of the children.  Caine's ability to span that range was remarkable.Finally, I have the highest praise for Delroy Lindo as Mr. Rose, the orchard foreman.  Lindo's bright smile and enthusiasm created a rock solid character with charm, strength and simple wisdom.  He captures our admiration immediately, and despite his despicable act, we cannot help but pity him in the end.After having seen all the films that were nominated by the Academy for best picture last year, I have to say that this was my personal favorite.  It wasn't as flashy as the rest; in fact, this was downright old fashioned in its approach.  They just don't write stories like this anymore, and that's a shame.  I rated it a 10/10.  In its quiet way, it captured my heart.

A young boy, played by Tobey Maguire, is born and raised in an orphanage. He is taught the ways of childbirth and abortion by the headmaster, Dr. Larch, played by Michael Caine. The young boy wants to be more useful in life and goes on his own way to end up working in an apple orchard and learning about lobster fishing.The Maguire boy/man character fights with his own morals and lack of worldliness as the movie progresses. The predictable ending probably couldn't have been any better. Life happens. Bad things often happen to good people. This movie does question your thoughts of humanity.I found raw emotion, humor and tenderness in this movie. The story is set in Maine; but actually filmed in Vermont and Connecticut too. Scenery is awesome. Maguire's timid, monotone character does take some getting used to. Caine was very good. Charlize Theron proved that not only is she beautiful, but she can act as well.

It must help that the novelist adapts his own work and writes the screenplay. This novel is a large, complex work with many characters and sub-plots. It would have been easy for the screenwriter to become bogged down in details and losing their way. Irving doesn't. He grabs at the major thematic thread and defines an engrossing tale of growing up and discovering one's self and one's calling. Set in rural Maine during World War II we follow Homer Wells, adolescent ward of an orphanage run by Dr. Larch. Visually it's a dark foreboding place, put emotionally full of love and happiness, excepting the sad women who trek to the orphanage to unburden themselves of their pregnancies, either by adoption or (illegal) abortion. Dr. Larch helps with both. Dr. Larch has also provided Homer with an education in practical obstetrics that would be the envy of any medical school. I don't want to go on further with the plot, it's a sweeping tale told with great acting, camera work, and scoring.What worries me about this near perfect film is that my views are colored by having first read the novel.  The characters and locations in the movie are exactly as I visualized them. It's spooky. And this provides me with information to fill in gaps about the character's motives and drives. How big a hindrance is not having read the book? I hope not much, because I feel this is one of the best movies of 1999.

However, the makers of this carefully crafted film tiptoe so adroitly around such issues as abortion, murder, infidelity, and incest as to leave the audience with an ample helping of the warm and fuzzies.

"}{"Title":"Caine's Rules","Date":"13 March 2000","Score":"21 out of 28 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"                 The Cider House Rules is a folksy tale about a boy from an orphanage and his coming of age. He's been trained to deliver babies at the orphanage by the benevolent Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine).        	Notably this boy's passage into manhood necessitates him accepting the responsibility of also performing illegal abortions! Now there's a twist. John Irving, also wrote the books The World According To Garp and The Hotel New Hampshiire, made into films of the same name, as well as A Prayer For Owen Meany which was made into the puzzling Simon Birch, a film Irving vigourously disowns.        Irving subsequently, in the case of Cider House, has also written the screenplay.        The actual cider house rules are a minor element of a rambling film that is full of such minor events.They are a non-consequential, ignored set of laws meant to govern the behaviour of the workers who bunk in the cider house on an apple farm.        But life's like that, or so John Irving and his film would have you believe. It's just that usually films concentrate a little more on life's more tumultuous moments.        Young Homer Wells (our budding unlicensed doctor) is played delightfully by Tobey Maguire (Pleasantville)with a sweet smile and sleepy eyes. Those of you who prefer your actors to be more dynamic might find Maguire to be too even, but in this film his style  was just the ticket.        He's one of the boys who were never chosen to be adopted at the orphanage. There are some touching scenes centred around the children in particular not being selected, hovering with their bags packed.        Homer sets off to see the world with new friends Candy (Charlize Theron) and Wally (Paul Rudd). They had attended the orphanage for an abortion.        Homer sees the sea for the first time. He learns how to pick apples and to get on with his work mates. He has a romance. And he learns how to accept responsibility for his and other's actions away from the shelter of the orphanage. And that's about it. And that's just enough.        The mood of the film accentuates a dreamy continuance; years and seasons merge. Life goes on. The apples grow. Relationships develop. The scenery is beautiful. The black labourers accept their lot.        This is life (and death) seen from the personal; a snapshot of middle, rural America; a land where you're meant to just get on with it and accept your lot.        The Cider House Rules is sensitively directed and written with an emphasis on people caring for each other. It's a bit of a weepy. Even villains are given their good sides.  "},{"Title":"a film of many strengths and weaknesses","Date":"13 August 2000","Score":"21 out of 32 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  When a film takes place in two entirely different settings - involving almost two entirely different sets of characters - it inevitably runs the risk that one of the two sides will generate more interest than the other and that the movie itself will appear to break into halves of unequal quality.  The end result is that such a film may seem to be disjointed and lacking in the cohesive unity necessary for any work of genuine art.`The Cider House Rules' runs the risk and falls into the trap.  The first section, set in a Maine orphanage in 1943, fascinates us not merely with the sheer novelty of the setting but with the central figure of the piece, the doctor and caregiver who becomes the focus of our attention.  Brilliantly portrayed by Michael Caine, Dr. Larch is a man who provides love to a collection of children otherwise ignored and abandoned by an uncaring world. The most controversial aspect of the character involves the fact that Dr. Larch also provides abortions for women who want them at a time when the operation was still illegal and the only other alternative for many of these women was to suffer at the hands of inept practitioners of the operation. `The Cider House Rules' is certainly to be commended for tackling a subject that is virtually taboo in commercial moviemaking - albeit, it must be stated for those who do not adhere to abortion advocacy that the slant here is decidedly pro-choice despite the script's making a few gestures to the anti-abortion viewpoint early on in the film.The center of the film is occupied by a young man named Homer Wells, a twice-rejected orphan who grows up at the orphanage almost as Dr. Larch's medical protégée and whom Dr. Larch appears to be grooming to take over his practice from him in the future.  The pseudo father-son relationships between Dr. Larch and Homer and between Homer and the boys who are in his charge are conveyed with genuine emotional power and heartwarming believability.   As prospective parents visit the facility, we feel deeply the desperation these children have to be adopted and to find a place where they will fit in.  Conversely, we empathize keenly with the sense of sadness and personal inadequacy that inevitably accompanies each of their many rejections.  Even more fascinating is the social context in which the drama plays itself out.  Because of his willingness to perform the abortions, Dr. Larch's position at the orphanage has come under attack from the board of trustees that runs the institution.  Thus, we are all primed for a gripping showdown between these two opposing forces and wonder how Homer will fit into the proceedings.Unfortunately, the author John Irving pulls the rug out from under us as he decides to take his story off into an almost entirely different direction. Feeling that he is missing out on a whole vast world waiting for him beyond the confines of this remote, isolated community, Homer, rather understandably for a sheltered young man, decides to abruptly leave the orphanage and to start life anew as an apple picker when he meets a soldier whose beautiful wife has come to the doctor for an abortion and whose family is in the cider making business.  Although Homer's sudden farewell results in a scene of great emotional power, as a whole torrent of conflicting emotions come flooding out of both Homer and the people he is leaving behind, the fact is that we sorely miss the orphanage once we are ripped away from it.  Somehow, the scenes on the farm - and they constitute well more than half of the film's running time - never match in intensity and interest those that have come before.  In fact, the least original and impressive aspect of the film is the predictable and conventional adulterous affair that Homer and the soldier's wife, Candy (Charlize Theron), indulge in when her fighter-bomber husband returns to the war.   Has there ever in the movies been a case of a beautiful young wife who did not cheat on her husband the minute he went on a mission overseas?  The theme of the story - as represented by the posted list of  `cider house rules' that we are told by one of the characters are not too be followed because whoever wrote them didn't live in the cider house - seems to be that rules are made to be broken, although in some cases - such as incest - the violation goes so far over the edge that such an act will always result in disastrous consequences for the perpetrator.  Throughout the film, the characters always seem to be abandoning the rules set out for them by society.  Dr. Lance performs illegal operations, creates a phony resume and a set of counterfeit documents in an attempt to get the board to hire Homer as his assistant, and even deceives Homer into believing he suffers from a serious heart ailment to keep him out of the service.  Homer himself seems to suffer little guilt as he pursues a love affair with the wife of the man who has kindly entrusted him with a job when he most needs it.More interesting than this theme, however, is the more subtle one of parents - whether real or ersatz - learning to let go of the child in whom one has invested all one's dreams and hopes for the future.  The genuine heartbreak Dr. Lance suffers as Homer leaves to find a new place in the world becomes almost palpable as written on Caine's beautifully expressive, craggy face. Unfortunately, this aspect of the film is, understandably I suppose, played out almost entirely in scenes in which letters are exchanged back and forth between the two principals and in which their feelings are conveyed in the rather undramatic form of voice-over narration.  In fact, after Homer leaves, Dr. Lance becomes virtually a minor character in the story and, with his withdrawal from the scene of action, much of the emotional energy of the earlier portions drains out of the film.Director Lasse Hallstrom deserves high praise for the fine performances he has drawn from a uniformly excellent cast.  As Homer, Tobey Maguire brings a quiet, understated niceness to the pivotal role. Particularly noteworthy are the young boys who fill the early sections of the film with so much infectious life and emotion.  They are cute without being adorable, touching without being cloying.  Hallstrom has also captured the alternately lush, alternately bleak Maine landscape to striking effect.`The Cider House Rules' is more a thing of bits and pieces than a fully integrated, wholly satisfying work of cinematic art.  But much of it is so powerful and extraordinary that it is a film that, despite its missed potential, still manages to stay with one long after it is over.

The sentiment keeps it from being quite unqualified masterpiece, but the naturalism of the three main actors (Michael Caine, Tobey Maguire, and Charlize Theron) makes it rather convincing. And touching.The writing is also spot on, a bit of magic starting with John Irving's highly regarded novel, and his own screenplay. As the events compound and a tight group of principal characters gets further intertwined, their believability becomes essential as events become more sensational. And it works. It's almost an American fable with moral edges like To Kill a Mockingbird, tightly knit and with a higher ground charted above the usual trench warfare around the issues, particularly illegal abortions.The director Lasse Hallstrom is the wild card here, and deserves unusual praise coming almost out of nowhere on this&#x85;almost meaning he did have What's Eating Gilbert Grape and My Life as a Dog behind him. We can only hope this Swedish director crosses the border often, or at least keeps making Swedish films that get distributed here in the U.S. (I have to confess I found his more recent Shipping News unbearable but I know a lot of people were really moved by it.)Beyond the story and the stars, it's really worth saying the there is a cast of secondary characters--nurses at the orphanage and a crew of African-American apple pickers at the orchard--that deserve huge praise. And then there are the smaller characters, literally, the children. Here I give the actors credit but also Hallstrom for getting them to forget the camera and be themselves. I could have watched an extended version of many scenes because being there and having so many interesting convincing people around was enough.But of course it's better trimmed down and efficient. And hard hitting. You'll cry, or you don't have a pulse. Or you're one of the cynical, which I get. For those who have a softer side for movies, this will win you over and turn your head.

Like impromptu parents arriving to take under their wing the eldest orphan in the establishment, Homer takes his chance to explore the world beyond the railway station - much to the distress of his surrogate father, Wilbur.Initially lost in the foreign environment of the fruit farm run by Wally's mother Olive (Kate Nelligan), Homer soon finds himself well looked after by Arthur Rose (Delroy Lindo) who is the gang boss of the illiterate, migrant fruit-pickers. Accompanied by his unpromisingly named daughter Rose Rose (Erykah Badhu), the small group in the bunk house provide a rich learning environment for the perceptive, but naive Homer.Homer's adventures are many and as the story twists and turns, he finds love and best of all he finds himself through his experience of the wider community he now inhabits.There is so much more in this film that space permits to even hint at. It is comic, tragic, touching and moving. I can't recommend it highly enough.

It is definitely a very rich story. I think it is difficult to separate both notions presented by the movie morality (is abortion a good or a bad thing, and from which point of view as both are present), and equality between Men, in terms of the racial issue. The movie takes place in the 40's, just before the US declared war to Japan. The work on how Afro-Americans should be treated had not yet really started, and they were still not very much considered as real equals to the whites. The rules which are part of the movie title in the first place, are imposed on the Afro-Americans who work in the Cider House, assuming they are stupid and unable to behave responsibly and with common sense. It is about the laws imposed on Men by other Men who do not necessarily understand the implications and the situations of those who have to comply with those rules. That leads naturally to the question of the Law  is the Law only a list of rules that we must obey without questioning at any time, or might it sometimes be a more blurry notion that sensible individuals might have to work out for themselves according to the circumstances? Or can we take into account that Life itself , and chance, sometimes lead to another form of Justice, as it eventually happens at the end? To me, it is a real must see. I would recommend parents to offer it to their teenagers as a means to let them build their own vision of the world.... Yes! it goes that far!!

He helps us to observe aspects of relationships and life in unique ways that we often find funny. I find that his stories, in absence of his narrative voice, miss the point (his point).The Cider House Rules, on the other hand, captures the essence of the novel, most notably through Michael Caine's voice-overs and dialogue.

The movie, due to its subject matter, could have easily turned into a cheesy movie of the week, but it avoids this marvelously thanks to some great performances, great character direction and a beautiful photography. This is indeed a standard coming-of-age story.  Not having read the book, I still felt the story condensed, and some of its other threads not fully realized, like the subject of abortion which starts very strongly, but then fades for a while only to come back later at the end.  Much better and subtle is the depiction of race in the early part of the 20th century, although some African-Americans might find it a little offensive to them. Delroy Lindo gives an astounding performance with so very little.  Erykah Badu is a revelation.  Michael Caine is at his best, and shows the younger cast what acting is all about. Tobey Maguire is likeable as usual, but gives a performance similar to his role in Pleasantville -with little or no emotion and seeming to have more insight into other character's lives than John Irving, the author, himself.  This worked great in Pleasantville, but it was wrong for this movie. While sometimes melodramatic and predictable, the story does deliver its punches well and you shouldn't be ashamed to let a tear wash your cheeks. Come Oscar time, you won't see The Cider House Rules in any big category, but still it is a movie that will play well and be enjoyed by many.

John Irving's main focus was not pro-choice in terms of abortion, but pro-choice in terms of each and every one of us making important and responsible decisions for ourselves.  The fact that the title is The Cider House Rules reveals that the author thinks this idea sums up the whole narrative.  Those rules posted in the cider house represent a more powerful, outside force attempting to control those that live within that cider house. It was also rhetorically inquired earlier at the isolated orphanage What have their the outside's laws ever done for you?  The intent of the film was profound in its simplicity There are no absolute rules (in a cider house or anyplace else) which govern our lives other than those which we out of necessity construct for ourselves.  One needs to know their business, and caring human beings have the responsibility to develop rules that are appropriate to the unique circumstances in which they find themselves.  The only time where imposing across the board rules that automatically prescribe responses to every situation is in a robot.  We are not robots.  Irving's views on abortion follow directly from this mentality, and this story is an attempt to explain the rational reasons behind them.  But please realize that it is merely an example.  If you were to get hung up about your own staunch views, be it pro-choice or pro-life, then you are missing out on a bigger picture that transcends both.

Everybody loves him. In 1943, Wally Worthington (Paul Rudd) and girlfriend Candy Kendall (Charlize Theron) come for an abortion. Homer decides to leave the orphanage with them to everyone's chagrin including Dr. Larch. He works at their apple farm staying in their Cider House with the seasonal workers. Wally goes off to war. Candy and Homer start an affair together. Dr. Larch is setting up for Homer to return as the new doctor in the orphanage as Larch fakes all the medical credentials even without Homer's approval.The movie floats through many points and many themes in this story. The movie opens with a slow but interesting orphanage story. When Homer leaves the orphanage, the movie diffuses the attention between him and back at the orphanage. It is still interesting but the movie loses some of the little intensity. The romance lacks a certain heat. I don't think Tobey Maguire is a particularly good romantic lead. The story does have a nice slow burn. It's a fascinating dark poetic feel that keeps pulling back the audience. It takes some dark turns. The movie is based on a novel.

There was something that bothered me. Here is the first scene that bothered me. Homer takes a pot outside to an incinerator, he looks in the pot, there is revulsion. I knew immediately what was in the pot. Shortly thereafter we get the lecture on abortion by Dr. Larch. It did not seem right to me. The lecture did not fit the opening, arrival at a place to gain or lose a child. Later in the movie we are introduced to the actual cider house rules. They are dismissed as something that have not been chosen and absurd and do not have to be followed by those who work in the cider house. Of course, there are real cider house rules, you do not throw a cigarette in the cider! I guess we are supposed to come away with the idea that there are real rules we accept and have to follow and there are other rules that are imposed and mean nothing and we do not need to follow. This is a pretty empty message. There is the scene where Mr. Rose's body is being taken out of the dormitory. We see the migrants sitting on the cider house roof, watching. If they had accepted the rule, and violated it as a tribute, that would have had dramatic impact. The problem with this movie is that in its world there are no rules. The most important scene for me is when Mr. Rose confronts Homer and says we make up the rules every day. This is supposed to be some sort of learning experience for Homer, I guess. You have to watch the scene and decide for yourself. For me this was the worm at the heart of the movie. A rule is not something you make up every day. Rules are something that persist from day to day. Rules are something that a character believes in. Dramatic power does not come out of breaking a rule. Dramatic power does not come out of consequences for breaking a rule. Dramatic power comes out of the agony of a character for breaking a rule. In this movie many rules are broken. I see no torment. I see reaction to consequences, but no internal conflict. Let me put this crudely, Mr. Rose can bang his daughter and that is OK if she acquiesces. When she is fed up and wants to run away and stabs him that is OK too? He will do the right thing and cover up her guilt for the stabbing? What if she had not run away, would he have continued to bang her? This is not a bad movie. It could have been a great movie for me, if it had stuck to the tagline.

It's the story of a brainy young man's journey through life, starting with his involvement at a secluded orphanage/abortion clinic in St. Cloud, Maine, where he is born.   Homer Wells, as he is named, is raised and mentored by the ether-huffing Dr. Larch, the establishment's resident doctor who eventually teaches Homer everything about medicine.  A chance meeting with a beautiful pregnant woman and her army-hero boyfriend (after an abortion) causes Wells to hitch a ride with them, much to the displeasure of Dr. Larch, and venture out into the world to explore life as an apple-picker.  However, as Homer's life heads into new directions (some dangerous), his past morality and ideals rear their head, only to clash with his complicated present.Whereas the novel focused more on character development, coming-of-age values and generational issues, the film emphasizes the notion of discipline and the breaking of rules.  At every turn in the film (which, by the way, isn't long enough to cover the genius of Irving in all his aptitude), and I mean every turn, someone is breaking a rule &#150; it's almost subconsciously irksome (keep in mind, the film does center around abortion during a time when it was illegal).  As a result, I don't get the same sense of resolution and clarity in the film that makes the novel so endearing.Plus, I'm not sold on the main cast.  I didn't mind Michael Caine (excellent line Good night, you princes of Maine -- you kings of New England!), and though I really like both Toby Maguire and Charlize Theron, neither of them posses the magic of Irving's characters, and certainly don't create an attachment that viewers care about in the film.  I might even go as far as to say they're mismatched. Nevertheless, I give mad props to those in the supporting roles!  Delroy Lindo, playing the incestuous Mr. Rose, should have gotten an Oscar nod (better yet, he should have done a comedy with Evander Holyfield as his twin brother).

I've read most of his novels, but none of them have moved me in the same way as The Cider House Rules.Naturally, I was a little leery about seeing one of my all-time favorite novels dramatized.  The casting really caught my eye, especially Michael Caine as Wilbur Larch (I originally pictured Richard Harris in the role, for some reason), and Charlize Theron as Candy.  I have a lot of respect for Ms. Theron as an actress, and she's very easy on the eyes.It also helped that John Irving himself wrote the screenplay ... and took a LOT of time (ten years) to do so.  I can understand why, too ... the story arc within the novel spans something like forty years ... more like eighty, if you figure in Dr. Larch's biography as well.  To present the core of a story that massive within a two-hour block of time, without losing any major elements of the story, was quite a challenge.Well, Mr. Irving was up to the challenge, and the movie was wonderful.  The actors were convincing, the dialogue was good, the pacing of the story was very good.  I was surprised at some of the changes, certain elements that had been left out, situations that the characters reacted to differently on screen than they had in the novel.  What surprised me even more was that all of these things worked, and made the story work as well, if not better than, in the original story.SPOILERS BELOWNow, as to the agenda of the story My girlfriend has referred to it as the feel-good, pro-choice movie.  I think that Mr. Irving does have a very strong opinion about abortion, and he does express it within the story, but there's a deeper message to it; that people have to make moral and ethical judgements about laws, and decide for themselves which ones are worth following and which ones are better off ignored or only followed for the sake of appearances.Dr. Larch has decided that, since women will seek out abortions whether they are legal or not, he will perform an abortion on whoever asks, in a time when abortion was completely illegal; this is better than the potentially fatal alternatives, which are spelled out in graphic detail in the novel, and mentioned several times in the movie.So, he's risking his medical licensure, his job, and his freedom in order to provide a service in a way that will save the lives of women who might otherwise be severely injured or die.Regardless of your personal views of this hot-button issue, you have to respect the character of Dr. Larch for continuously risking so much to do something, just because he feels that it's the right thing to do.

But, intriguing was not the word for this piece of filmmaking. Brilliant is a more deserved word.Academy Award winning Michael Caine is the benevolent, ether-sniffing Dr. Larch, who runs a remote orphanage and performs illegal abortions for desperate women. Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire) is delivered, raised and loved by the doctor, who expects Homer to succeed him.  But Homer longs to experience the world and find his own way. And when glamorous bomber pilot Wally (Paul Rudd) arrives on the scene, Homer's odyssey of love and betrayal begins, with narration from Caine and the affectionate, sarcastic correspondence between the father figure and the innocent abroad bridging the two. Inevitably, the crisis demands that Homer makes some difficult choices.Many dramas are beautiful, but sometimes just downright boring. If you think The Cider House Rules is ever going to be boring, think again. No, it isn't a marvellously never-ending thriller with action sequences every 15 minutes, but the plot twists are beautifully stringed together and the connection of the characters is entertaining and lovely. The actors are all extremely impressive, Tobey Maguire is perfect for the role of Homer, while Charlize Theron, Paul Rudd and Michael Caine make for an engaging supporting cast. The direction from the well-known Swedish mastermind Lasse Hallstrom is amazing, it is hard not to stand up and cheer for his effort that went into The Cider House Rules.Beautiful, memorable, realistic and intriguing, The Cider House Rules is strongly recommended to all audiences.I rate The Cider House Rules 9 out of 10.

This is pretty sad, considering the fact that Irving adapted the screenplay himself, and won an Oscar for it to boot! The irony is priceless!I don't mind so much that this adaptation did away with some of the novel's sub-plots (the character of Melony, and Homer's friendship with Wally) for the sake of economy.  What irks me though is that it trades in the original novel's sardonic edge for schmaltz and sentimentality.  The movie is designed to make audiences ooh and aah over those cute 'lil orphans.  It is a highly manipulative and candy-coated movie.  Sure, Irving's novel had a lot of heart and sentimentality as well, but at least it showed some restraint.  I probably would have liked this movie adaptation a lot more if it didn't try so hard to be an audience pleaser.  What next? A G-rated version of A Widow for One Year?If you want to see a more worthy adaptation of a John Irving novel, I highly recommend George Roy Hill's The World According to Garp starring Robin Williams and Glenn Close.

My companion found it very moving and cried periodically through it.This is not a movie that those who are very strong on the anti-abortion side could like.  For all others, there's some good story telling going on here.  The movie presents some of the fallacies, weaknesses, aspirations, and occasional rising above that which is the stuff of life.  Afterwards, I was struck by how much like a Garrison Keillor monologue (on Lake Woebegon) this movie was in telling a story that weaves in frailties and transcendence while at the same time simplifying and taking a few liberties with reality for the sake of spinning a good story.   The movie brushes against some very thorny, complex issues (adoptions, orphanages, failed adoptions, group home vs. family placement, incest, abortion, infidelity, professional qualifications of physicians, etc.).  It doesn't examine the complexities of any of these but instead uses them to cast an interesting, entertaining story. The movie gets its title from a set of rules posted by people who never live in the ciderhouse; the movie suggests (somewhat inconsistently) that what you do in the name of love is usually more valuable than following the letter of the law.      I thought the cast was uniformly good. I agree with Michael Caine who thought there were others who could be as deserving of the Oscar; but he did very well in his part as did all the actors in other major and minor roles.As a former New Englander, indelibly acquainted with the era and  the territory, the views of the country were satisfying.  The outdoor shots were filmed in ME, MA, & VT and captured the feel and look satisfyingly well.  Whoever was responsible for research did a good job on the cars, most of the clothes, etc. Few people may notice the small (3x4) windshield stickers, white letter on black background, that proclaims A (meaning the lowest level on the wartime gas rationing program). The Ford Model A truck with the shortened wheelbase & cut-off cab in which the lieutenant takes Homer on a wild ride of the orchards was a common farm vehicle of the times; in VT, we called them doodlebugs and they did much of the work of a farm tractor but had a lot more speed.  Candy's knees wouldn't have been so much revealed -- that was a serious fault of those times that the movie fortunately corrected.         So if you're interested in really strict accuracy and logic, don't see it.  It'll give you enough things to grumble about -- the lack of any mention of school for the kids or its effects; the role of the state board of medicine; the presence of blacks in New England; the impossibility of living a New England  winter in those years in a ciderhouse, etc.  But no matter -- as a story and a movie, it's worth an 8.

Its position on abortion (with which I'm in sympathy) is the present day respectable morality in Hollywood, and it is as self-congratulatory on that position as any message movie from the late 40s. Every character has his or her assigned role made clear at once, and every one does exactly what the role requires, no more no less.SPOILER WARNINGWe know from the outset that Homer will come of age and that his maturity will lead him back to the orphans who are his true family (and thank goodness for poor Mary Agnes, or she'd explode).  We know as soon as we first see them that Fuzzy will die, that Wally will be ruined by the war, that Candy will cheat on Wally with Homer and get punished by God for it, and that Rose Rose will test Homer's principles about abortion.  We know, because the logic of the story compels it, that Dr. Larch must die so that Homer, his de facto son, can replace him as patriarch.  It's all very well done, but there are no real surprises (except maybe the truth about Homer's heart condition).There are, however, a couple of points where you need a pretty heavy duty suspension of disbelief.  A couple of long time hometown sweethearts in Candy and Wally's position in 1943 usually got married before the boy shipped out (although they may have lived to regret it later).  There's nothing apparent in either of the characters or their situation to make them pick abortion instead.  And Candy's future mother in law turned an extraordinarily blind and forbearing eye to her goings on with Homer out in the Cider House.  And it will be real interesting to hear the first time that Homer, forged diplomas or no, has to pass himself off to the orphanage trustees as a medical missionary who has spent the past couple of years in India.Hallstrom is an excellent director of young actors, and this is a good, solid piece of work, but it has no business being nominated for best picture over the far superior but amoral, misogynistic and somewhat reactionary Talented Mr. Ripley.

Our consumer- and youth-oriented culture seems to strongly encourage a surface orientation toward everything.  Almost nobody wants or is interested in deeper things anymore.  To know is enough... to *understand* seems like too much work.  The simple faith in the *moment* shown in this movie is breathtaking.  In The Cider House Rules, life is presented as taking place within a particular context, in an amazingly realistic way (not everybody is in control, just like in real life -- there are times when things get out of control, and we don't know why).  Boring to some people, maybe.  It doesn't get the adrenaline rushing.

The Cider House Rules is gorgeous to look at, providing a real feel for the seasons and the beauty of Maine; its gorgeous close-ups reveal the heart of the characters.       The Cider House Rules is simple and subtle.  It doesn't provide a treatise on abortion, its rights and wrongs, nor does it actually SHOW you the gory details.  Instead, you see the faces of the doctors and patients reacting to the process, like Mr. Rose's horrified face as he watches his daughter put through it.  You feel how grotesque abortion can be, even for a doctor like Larch in favor of it, his anger and addiction to ether revealing his own repulsion for the procedure.  Irving's characters and scenes show rather than tell, which I suppose is the secret of the miracle of moving from printed page to silver screen.  I am personally and politically pro-choice, but at the same time I'm against the death penalty.  One runs into a lot of conflict for holding these two seemingly contradictory positions let the guilty felon live for he is a human being, but the innocent child may be sacrificed.  This film brought up that moral conflict in me once more.         However, the Cider House Rules is not meant to be so controversial.  It is meant to stir emotions and compassion, which it does incredibly well.  Tobey Maguire, Michael Caine, Delroy Lindo, and Erykah Badu all do fantastic work with their characters, miraculously bringing out the humanity of people who perform acts that many of us would find morally corrupt, incest, adultery, abortion, yet they force our compassion instead of our criticism.      I don't think the Cider House Rules will receive any big award in the end except perhaps Best Adapted Screenplay, which it certainly merits.

A commenter or two who worked on the film has said in this space that all the cast gave it their best, and I believe it is true.

Many people have told me they don't like his books because of the subject or what the characters do, but I respond that Irving's strength is taking a less than beautiful subject and bizarre characters and then telling a 'dickens' of a good story around them.I always thought that Irving's books, much like those of Michael Crichton, exist in part because of a desire the author has to make  the reader think about a subject. They both tell gripping and involving stories, and in the course of reading and enjoying them, the reader's mind is forced to view a controversial subject from unexpected angles, and perhaps have one's wisdom or understanding broadened.Getting back to the movie adaptation of Irving's The Cider House Rules, I fully expected that only the basic plot would transfer to the screen, with the underlying subject and thought-provoking material left out. I was quite surprised that the screenplay did not abandon it's soul. In spite of the deletion of at least one major character and about 90% of the timeline, the essence remains and the impact is pretty much the same.The movie does still make one think about differing views on the subject of abortion, and might encourage viewers to take a broader view of the subject. However, this is not an 'abortion' movie; the actual subject is more of a 'coming of age' one.I viewed this film on Christmas day in a theatre that had no empty seats. Members of my party have differing views on positions on abortion, but none were offended and all liked the movie.

Based on the John Irving novel `The Cider House Rules' tells the story of orphan Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire) who is raised by orphanage doctor Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine). Dr. Larch teaches Homer the magic of his craft. One day the orphanage is visited by a beautiful woman (Charlize Theron) and her GI boyfriend (Paul Rudd) this causes a dilemma for Homer. Does he really want to know what its like in the real world? Another feeling Homer isn't to sure about is his feelings for this woman. He decides to leave the orphanage in search of love and a new life.	`The Cider House Rules' is a feel good type film with an underlining of controversy. The controversy plagues a lot of mankind today. It being the abortion conflict between `Pro-Life' and `Pro-Choice'. Throughout most of the film, Maguire's hero struggles with the morals of his mentor and exactly how will he approach that exact dilemma.      Without having read the novel, I am not sure what screenwriter/novelist John Irving left out of his novel but I found the story moving and interesting. Tobey Maguire delighted me with another hero role in the surprise of last year, `Pleasantville'. That role and his in this film have a lot in common as they struggle with a decision that will vastly change each of their lives. Charlize Theron continues to find strong woman roles and juicy scripts as she hones her talent. As for the chemistry between Maguire and Theron it is quite lacking and makes me think of a supermodel and a teen boy. Maguire's depth never really fleshes out Homer as he seems to hide a lot of what is occurring within Homer.        What I did love in the film was the return of Michael Caine to a role he can be good at. He hasn't had one since 1997 where he starred in two great roles.

Although such individuals may couch their criticism in terms of script, actors, and production values, the cause for their dislike is the film's highly existentialistic tone re personal values, its pro-choice stance re abortion, and the fairly compelling argument it makes in favor of that position. Set during World War II, CIDER HOUSE is the story of a child named Homer(Tobey Maguire) raised in a Maine orphanage by stubborn but likable Dr. Larch (Michael Caine), who trains Homer in medical arts. As Homer comes of age, however, he becomes increasingly unhappy with Dr. Larch's tight grip and extremely displeased with the fact that Dr. Larch also casually provides safe but highly illegal abortions to women who demand them. Consequently, Toby sets off to see the world--and finds himself working in an apple orchard, where he lives in the cider house with black seasonal farm workers.There is a great deal to recommend this film. Although Tobey Maguire sometimes overplays the innocence of the character, his performance of the unworldly Homer is generally effective; the real stars of the film, however, are Michael Caine, who brings remarkable humanity to the difficult role of Dr. Larch, and Charlize Theron, with whom Homer falls in love. The supporting cast--which includes Delroy Lindo, Jane Alexander, Kathy Baker, and Erykah Badu--is quite fine. The cinematography is remarkably beautiful, and although not necessarily memorable in terms of dialogue the script is quite effective.Still, the film tends to rely more upon mood than upon actual substance, and as such becomes increasingly predictable as the action progresses, and most viewers will know how the story will end by the time they reach the film's midway point; it also has a very leisurely feel that some viewers will read as slow. Although it forms the crux of the conflict between Homer and Dr. Larch, the issue of abortion is never really fully explored and is presented in a rather one-sided (although very effective) manner. Those expecting an intense, fast-paced drama will be disappointed, and as previously noted pro-life viewers will despise the film from the word go; even so, and in spite of its occasional failings, most viewers will find it thought-provoking, extremely touching, and quite memorable.Gary F.

It's a touching tale of orphans, specifically Homer Wells and his discovery of life outside of St. Cloud. There's much to be taken from this film for viewers of many ages, although children probably won't be prepared to enjoy it.While they are not biologically related, they enjoy and suffer many of the slings and arrows that a father and son would Wilbur loves Homer and gives him what he can, which is hope, protection and `near-perfect obstetrical procedure'. As children do, Homer resists Larch's goals for him, specifically to assume Larch's role as a doctor in the orphanage. Instead Homer ventures away when a convenient opportunity presents itself in the form of a young couple leaving after the woman had an abortion. The couple, Candy Kendall and Wally Worthington, are Homer's age but much more worldly. It is here where Homer's simple appreciation of the world is apparent and most appealing. He had never seen the ocean and so Wally and Candy show Homer the Atlantic. Candy will later show Homer a drive in movie theater, which Homer professes to love, despite it never being open . Homer looked forward to a career picking apples, typically reserved for migrants, and didn't think anything of living with the migrants in the cider house. He finds joy in every aspect of life at the orchard, while others find misery in the same setting. I admire Homer's approach and seek to find more joy in the mundane, every day occurrences that we are so often too busy to even notice.It is the rules from which the film, and novel, derive their title. Literally put, there is a set of rules posted in the cider house that are meant for the migrant workers. However, the workers cannot read, and so the rules are ignored in favor of their own unwritten rules. Many of the migrants' rules are governed by the deft knife of Mr. Rose, the foreman of the migrant workers. It is Homer that will reveal to the workers what the rules actually say, and unwittingly, it is Mr. Rose that will ultimately convince him of things that Dr. Larch had only tried to.It would be incomplete to review the film without mentioning the abortion issue, and yet it would be unfair to suggest that this is all the film is about. Dr. Larch accepts as the Lord's work to carry out whatever the women arriving at St Cloud's want. This is to say that he delivers babies when asked, and performs abortions (at a time when they are illegal) for those that aren't `quick', or too far developed. This is important to him as he is well trained and carries out the abortions safely while other women take matters into their own hands, often with dangerous and lethal results. Despite his best efforts, Dr. Larch never is able to convince Homer to perform abortions.The film and the book are not the same- the book is simply far too long to include everything. Homer's childhood is largely lost in the film, accounted for instead by a montage in the opening scenes and the introduction of Buster who reveals some of what Homer was as a child in the novel. Among the most notable differences are the absence of Melony and the chronology of the movie. Melony is a major character in the novel, only surpassed by Dr. Larch and Homer. She was a very powerful character, and Irving feared she'd overpower others in the film, especially since Michael Caine wanted to play a softer Dr. Larch. As for the time frame, the movie is greatly compressed. Whereas the book took place over several decades, and Homer leaves the orphanage for 15 years, the film takes place over 15 months. This requires of course some things to change- in the film Candy is the sexual aggressor, the war is already in force, and the origin of Larch's ether addiction is a mystery. More significantly, Homer is a part of the Worthington family in the novel, becoming close friends with Wally, living in the `fancy house', becoming Olive's pseudo-son, and becomes the boss of Ocean View. Finally, Angel Wells (Candy and Homer's child) is absent in the film adaptation.This is not to say that the film is delinquent. These omissions and changes were necessary to present the story in a film version, and thus the film is a faithful adaptation of John Irving's 1985 novel. It ought to be, because Irving adapted the novel for the film and won an Oscar for his efforts.This is not a fluffy movie to half pay attention to while doing something else. To do so may lead you to think like some of the other reviewers here, that its simply a story about abortion and nothing else. If you finish this movie and think that way, watch it again because you've missed a lot.

And so it was with a young man who grew up an orphan in the State of Maine, in the years preceding World War II, in `The Cider House Rules,' directed by Lasse Hallstrom.  Under the tutelage and watchful eye of Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine), the administrator of the orphanage in which Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire) had lived his whole life, Homer, by 1943, had become quite knowledgeable and adept in the field of medicine.  What he lacked, however, was the formal education that would have enabled him to practice what he had learned, if indeed, he had so desired; which in fact he had not.  The orphanage was a world unto itself, a loving haven for unwanted children, but a place apart; and a larger world loomed just beyond it's perimeter, a world Homer Wells wanted to see.  And when circumstances present Homer with an opportunity to get away, he grabs it, and embarks upon his journey of discovery, much to the consternation of the good Dr. Larch, who fears that he has lost Homer-- whom he loves as a son-- to the world forever.  And forever is a long, long time. 	Hallstrom presents the story with acuity and care, drawing upon the innate humanity of the characters--especially Dr. Larch and Homer-- to bring it all to life.  While Dr. Larch epitomizes the benevolent nature of man, one who has known the world and has come into his own, has found the place from which he can do some good, Homer represents the longings of youth; no longer a boy, but a man who must discover on his own what Dr. Larch already knows.  And, as it is in real life, it becomes a matter of experience; and though fate ultimately intervenes with a nudge in the right direction, it is Homer who decides the direction his own life will take-- it is he who finally realizes what is meant to be.  And under Hallstrom's steady and skillful hand, the journey becomes, not only Homer's, but the viewer's as well, as he mines the emotional depths of the characters, making them people with whom the audience will be readily able to identify. 	Affecting an American accent for the first time in his career, Michael Caine gives a performance that deservedly earned him the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.  He brings Dr. Larch so vividly to life, capturing the deep concern and humanity of the man, while conveying his sincerity and exposing his vulnerability; it's a complete and real portrayal, enriched with nuance and altogether memorable.  As good as Caine is, however, the film clearly belongs to Maguire, who gives a masterfully understated performance as Homer.  There is such expression in the pacific nature he lends to the character, along with a sense of mature acceptance that serve to accentuate his inner yearnings, that make Homer so believable, a person with whom it is easy to sympathize and relate.  There is something of a wistful poet beneath his stoic, though gentle, outward appearance that makes him endearing.  With a subtle ability, Maguire makes it clear that Homer is a person of intrinsic good, and it gives not only the character, but the performance, a ring of truth and integrity.  It's exceptional work, and taken in conjunction with his turns in `The Ice Storm' and `Wonder Boys,' firmly establishes Maguire as one of the best young actors in the business today. 	The extraordinary supporting cast includes Delroy Lindo (Mr. Rose), Charlize Theron (Candy), Paul Rudd (Wally), Jane Alexander (Nurse Edna), Kathy Baker (Nurse Angela), Kieran Culkin (Buster), Kate Nelligan (Olive Worthington), K. Todd Freeman (Muddy), Erykah Badu (Rose Rose) and Erik Per Sullivan (Fuzzy).  Highlighted by outstanding performances and the sensitive interpretation and delivery of the story by Hallstrom, `The Cider House Rules' is a touching excursion into the depths of human emotions, and a taste of what life is all about.  More than just a film, it's an experience; one that will create a lasting impression on your soul, and one that absolutely must not be missed.  I rate this one 10/10.

Orphan Tobey Maguire stars as a young man who has been trained by a doctor in Maine (Michael Caine, in his second Oscar-winning role) to take over his role when he passes on.  However, Maguire is not sure that he wants to be Caine's successor because he questions whether abortions are right or not (Caine's primary duty at the orphanage).  When Maguire meets a young lady seeking an abortion (Charlize Theron) and her boy-friend (Paul Rudd), he decides to take the step into the real world and create his own destiny.  Caine does not feel that Maguire should leave, reasoning that life is much rougher out in the real world.  Maguire ignores this view and leaves anyway.  Rudd is going off to World War II and Maguire falls in love with Theron, but this complicates everything.  While Maguire does enjoy his life outside the orphanage, he learns that many decisions are very difficult.  A sub-story is the fact that a young apple picker on Rudd's mother's property (Erykah Badu) is pregnant with her father's (Delroy Lindo) child.  Now she is thinking about an abortion and Maguire must decide whether something he is totally against may be warranted.  All in all The Cider House Rules is one of those films that has a lot to say, but tries not to say anything too loudly to offend the audience.  When this happens, the film feels artificial and somewhat confusing.  John Irving's Oscar-winning screenplay is not near as smart as it would lead you to believe.  He deals with subjects of drug addiction, abortion, and incest, but never takes a solid stand on any issue.  All the characters are three-dimensional, but this is not necessarily a good thing.  Irving shows both good and bad things in every character and this makes the viewer skeptical about really caring for any of the players.  The casting is also interesting to say the least.  Erykah Badu, Paul Rudd, and Heavy D (!?) all have their moments, but their screen-time makes the film feel strange to the viewer.  Michael Caine is definitely the greatest asset of this film.  He dominates when on the screen and he makes The Cider House Rules a curiosity if nothing else.  Overall a good film, but far from excellent.  4 stars out of 5.

In a broader sense, I'm concerned that our society seems to believe it's necessary for a book to become a film in order for it to have any real existence. Mona Simpson said in an NPR interview that she was surprised that when well-wishers congratulated her on the release of the film Anywhere But Here (based on her book), they seemed to think that becoming a film was an important--if not necessary--stage in a book's life.

If it didn't deserve the nomination in the main category, it doesn't affect on its quality. It is a great film, with important messages about life. And director Lasse Hallstrom could pass this to the audience in a very beautiful way.Everything in our life needs some rules. The rules have to be established in infinite situations, even in a cider house. But what happens when we break this rules? Well, that's what this film answers, and very well.

Various contrived conflicts keep the plot moving along in an episodic way. And thusly, the film could easily have been transferred to TV as a weekly miniseries. Mercifully, it wasn't.The film's theme I suppose is that, amid life's conflicts and problems, we all need rules to live by. But this lesson, rather self-evident to any five-year old child, and taught implicitly in kindergarten and Sunday School, is presented here in a way that reeks of sap and sentimentality.The story's adult characters are stereotyped. The little boys and girls at the orphanage really tug at your heartstrings. The manipulative score, heavy with orchestral strings, is annoyingly drippy. My impression, therefore, is that the film is aimed at viewers who can easily lose themselves in the emotions of the various pitiful characters. Further, the script's plot is awkwardly contrived. And the story's ending is so predictable you can see it coming the proverbial mile away.Casting and acting are marginally acceptable. But if Tobey Maguire had been any more somnolent he would have been comatose. The film's direction and color cinematography are bland and mediocre, totally unremarkable.The Cider House Rules is the kind of film that Hollywood insiders dearly love sweet and uplifting, a real feel-good movie heavy on manipulative emotionalism.

For the first time as an adult he decides to leave the orphanage and goes with Candy Kendall to work her families orchard with the hired gangs.  Once there he learns just what Larch had been trying to teach him for years.I didn't know what this film was about when I sat to watch it.  Even when Michael Caine was winning his Oscar I was still none the wiser and only saw it yesterday.  Seeing how strong the pro-abortion argument is in the film made me surprised that the very liberal voters in the academy weren't turned against it.  However thick the message is laid in, it is made via a good story that stops short of ramming it down our throat.  As a melodrama it works very well, as an argument it is a little easy but works just as well.Director Hallström controls the film very well.  A lesser director could easily have made this a really mushy sentimental TVM or gone the other way and been too cold and distant. Hallström manages to walk the line between both, the film is emotional, but only because of the subject matter and not because he overdoes the story or uses cheap music.  At times the story appears a bit aimless and wandering, although given the sprawling nature of the source material this is perhaps to be expected.  Generally though it is very involving &#150; the couple of years journey of Homer, his odyssey if you will!Maguire is perfectly cast.  His understated performance allows us to see the story past him easily, but he brings enough so that the role is not a blank.  Caine is good but I can only assume that the field around him for the Oscar must have been weak or that he was an emotional choice (ageing actor needing a win etc).  Personally I felt his performance in Quiet American was miles better than this, but that's Oscar for you!  Having said that I think he is good but has little to do really.  Theron is good looking and happily makes Candy a more complex character than the romantic subplot occasionally makes you think she is.  For the most part her scenes with Homer drag a bit but she comes good towards the end.  The real lift for the film once it leaves the orphanage is two great performances on the farm.  Delroy Lindo is superb as the leader of the gang and Badu, in her first film, is really good.  Damn &#150; even Heavy D plays well!Overall this is a message film but it is balanced well and isn't just that.  The wandering story of Homer is involving by itself and the fact that it asks difficult questions and shows us the lessons of Homer just make it better.

Mr. Caine does fine work, as I suppose everyone in the cast does, but the characters and story line were so annoying, irritating, selfish and stupid, I could barely sit through it.Even the children at the orphanage were not exactly speckled pups in a little red wagon.First we have Michael Caine's character Dr. Larch, who is basically a father figure to Toby Maguire's character Homer Wells. Now on the surface Dr. Larch appears to be almost an angel--here is this saintly Dr. caring for these unwanted orphans, and being kind and loving. But Dr. Larch wants to browbeat Homer into also being a doctor, and we get the distinct impression that is not necessarily what Homer wants to do.Dr. Larch also has a problem dealing with reality when it comes to the orphanage children. These children are so protected from reality they have no concept of it whatsoever. When a young child dies, Dr. Larch secretly buries him, and the other children instead of attending a funeral and coming to terms with the fact there is such a thing as human death--are lied to, and told the deceased child has been adopted.I wondered, toward the end of the film, when an adult personage who worked at the orphanage passed away, if the kids were going to be told the adult had been adopted! Then we have Charlize Theron, as Candy Worthington, and her boyfriend Wally--who apparently are too stupid to use birth control--and too selfish and irresponsible to marry and become parents. But not to worry, Dr. Larch will solve that little problem that's getting in their way of a good time.Homer decides to suddenly leave the orphanage and go pick apples instead of becoming a doctor at the orphanage, which is what Dr. Larch plans him to be--never mind that he has no schooling and has not served any kind of internship at a hospital.Wally goes off to war, and Candy is left behind with a bad case of hot pants. Well there's Homer all handy, ready and willing-- faithfulness is not part of Candy's make up, and Toby feels no loyalty to his friend Wally--so soon he and Candy are rolling in the hay. I fully expected her to have a second pregnancy and abortion.The love scenes between Candy and Homer were definitely nothing I'd care to ever have to see again. Toby McGuire is a fine actor, but he is about as far from being a romantic leading man as you could get. His character, quite frankly, came across as an ignorant,homely nerd.We also have a little side story with some blacks who work at the apple farm. Now I'm quite familiar with migrant Mexicans traveling with the crops--but this is the first time I've ever seen or heard of any migrant crop and fruit picking blacks traveling with the crops.Get the barf bag ready because here comes the worst part of this movie--Rose Rose, one of the black migrants, gets pregnant. And just guess who Daddy is. What makes this so barf-worthy, however, is how they make this man, who is guilty of completely selfish lust--turn into this sacrificing, caring, sensitive person. Character reality flew completely out the window on that one.Then we learn that Wally is now paralyzed from the waist down. Good old Homer is more than ready to marry Candy, but no, she may shag everything in sight, but Wally is her one true love--yeah, right! One can only wonder how someone with the kind of sex drive Candy obviously has, is going to be able to deal with a husband, whom we are led to believe, has become totally impotent. But that's just one more stupid decision a character makes in this movie.Definitely THE worst film I have seen in some time.I voted it ONE star because I could not vote anything lower.

The true standout here was Tobey Maguire who delivers a very subtle performance and is the main reason why the story works so well. I'd say it's the best performance of his career. The film is old-fashioned (and the references to Dickens' David Copperfield reinforce that claim even more) as it manages to capture the humanity in the story with a wonderful adaptation from John Irving of his own 1985 novel. The film isn't afraid of tackling some moral dilemmas such as abortion and incest, and it does so without forcing a point of view on the audience. Lasse Hallstrom directs this film with his characteristic beautiful visual style although at times the melodrama can be a bit too sentimental. I felt like the film was much more similar in style to his prior film, What's Eating Gilbert Grape, as it focuses on several family dynamics and various subplots in a similar way. This is also as close as a Dickens movie we will get set in America. The film isn't perfect however and there are several relationships that feel forced, but I assume it has to do with trying to fit the most important elements of the novel into a two hour movie. The film opens with a voice-over narration from Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine) explaining how he became the orphanage director at St. Cloud, Maine. He takes special interest in a young boy named Homer Wells who is returned back to the orphanage immediately by every foster parent who attempts to adopt him. After a while it becomes evident to Dr. Larch that Homer will stay with them for a long time so he begins to teach him everything he knows about being a doctor. After several years, now Homer is a grown man (Tobey Maguire) who becomes Dr. Wilbur's assistant in the orphanage. When Lt. Wally (Paul Rudd) and his pregnant girlfriend Candy (Charlize Theron) show up at the orphanage to have an abortion that Dr. Larch is willing to do, Homer decides it is time to explore the outside world and leaves with the young couple. Wally offers him a job at his family's apple farm which he gladly accepts. Before heading back to war, Wally and Candy take Homer to see the ocean for the very first time and this is just the first of many first time experiences that Candy will go on to introduce him to. Meanwhile, Dr. Wilbur has hopes that Homer will return and carry on the work which he has groomed him for, but he refuses to consider himself a doctor and seems to be enjoying life picking apples and spending time with Candy. There are a couple of strong supporting performances from Delroy Lindo as one of the men in charge of the apple picking group and Erykah Badu who plays his daughter. Jane Alexander and Kathy Baker are two of the nurses in the orphanage who work with Dr. Larch. Some of the child actors playing orphans deliver some strong scenes as Kieran Culkin, Erik Per Sullivan, and Paz de la Huerta specially stand out. My greatest complaint with the cast however is that J.K. Simmons is given absolutely nothing to do here playing Candy's father. He seems to be only in a couple of montage scenes, but they completely misuse him. One of the strengths of the film however is that despite a shocking discovery surrounding Delroy Lindo's character, he is never portrayed as a one dimensional character. There is some complexity to his character and he isn't simply portrayed as a villain. On the moral dilemma surrounding the issue of abortion we have two characters with differing points of views, on the one hand Dr. Larch is very much for it, while Homer who has more faith in humanity is against it. The film may take a slightly pro abortion stand, but it doesn't feel heavy handed considering the main issue here is Homer's struggle to discover his own identity or follow the destiny Wilbur has traced for him. http//estebueno10.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Beautiful propaganda","Date":"26 April 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" This is a very well written, performed, and filmed movie. It stars Tobey Maguire as Homer - an orphan trained to assist the physician-in-charge of the orphanage. The physician (Michael Caine) is Dr. Larch - a gruff but loving step-father to his charges. The movie is set in the mid 1900's, in a Maine where abortion is quite illegal. Dr. Larch long-ago decided the law didn't make enough allowances and has dedicated himself to right these 'wrongs'. The movie deals with the coming-of-age of Homer Originally seeing the sanctity of all life, seizing an opportunity to see the larger world, and eventually coming to agree with Dr. Larch's philosophy. As I implied at the beginning, this is a very engrossing film. I wish it wouldn't have been used (and not so subtly) to justify abortion on demand. After all, Homer's love interest uses it simply for birth control, so she and her boyfriend won't be embarrassed/inconvenienced.

We grow up in some place and become familiar with this particular place. It is this familiarity that leads us to forget how good this place is and how deeply we are connected with the place. Only by leaving the place can we realize our deeply attachment with the place. Some of the most touching poems in ancient China is about poets' nostalgia.

Dr. Larch taught homer all medical knowledge he possessed, who becomes a skilled doctor but unlicensed. Homer wondered what life outside the orphanage would be like so when Wally and Candy visit the orphanage for an abortion Homer leaves with them and ended up working for Wally's family apple farm. Wally takes off to war leaving his girlfriend Candy and Homer at the cider house, where Homer learns a lot about love and life, in the end he returns to the orphanage to carry on Dr. Larch's work. One of the themes present in the film is, rules have different interpretations depending on the situation. In the film Homer was always against abortion, because it was the rule. But towards the end of the film he ended up performing an abortion himself. Some of the techniques which makes this film a good film includes the transitions between scenes and how the movie is shot. In this film you don't get to see jumps between scenes, they use ease you in to a scene and ease you out it using smooth transitions. A good example is the scene where Homer and Dr. Larch read letter that they wrote to one another, you can see how they switch from one scene to the other and also utilizing a montage like technique where time moves faster and they basically move you from one season to another. Cider house rules is a good film that really shows how important other aspects of the film making process are important in making the film good. The story is somewhat generic but how the story is presented is wonderful, it's simple but elegant. when you start watching the film it's a complete experience with beautiful music and dialogue, and the story feels complete, with techniques like montage they provide a lot of information in a short scene which helps connect the dots and make the film complete.

And it has always seemed to me that few A-list actors have so frequently been in awful movies AND been in so many top notch movies. So, I guess you could say I tolerated Michael Caine in films. But with this film, I came to truly appreciate his abilities.I had planned to go out with a woman friend to see American Beauty, but when someone asked if I knew the premise of the film -- the desire for sex with an underage girl -- I changed our plans and we went to see The Cider House Rules...which to my dismay turned out to be about abortion. I'm not sure that was a better film choice for a date movie.I have to admit that my liking of this movie has improved a great deal over the years. Abortion simply makes me uncomfortable. I'm politically pro-choice, but morally pro-life...although it's a difficult topic. But watching a movie like this shouldn't be about affirming or knocking down your political views, it should be about being absorbed in the story.Michael Caine is simply brilliant here. He's certainly not a beloved character in this film -- an abortionist (when needed) and addicted to ether -- but it's not about loving the character, it's about respecting the profession of acting. And so, Michael Caine -- A+.I'm also not a fan of Tobey Maguire, but again, I felt he was terrific in this film! It just seems as if Mr. McGuire needs to pick his roles very carefully.I have long thought that Charlize Theron is one of the best actresses out there...as well as, perhaps, the most beautiful. She doesn't disappoint here in either category.I believe this was the first film I ever saw Paul Rudd in, and he's quite good here, and usually.Delroy Lindo does a great job here in a role that is hardly a crowd pleaser. He's as close as this film gets to having a villain. Rose Erykah Badu is good as Rose.Two of my favorite character actresses are here as nurses -- Jane Alexander and Kathy Baker.Will you like this film? I think it depends on whether you get wrapped in the politics of abortion, or if you just want to see an excellent film, which is what this is. I may not have felt comfortable in this film, but damn...it's great!

Orphans, abortion, incest, suicide, addictions, affair, and migrant workers are some of the difficult issues explored in this story. Yet it is ultimately an uplifting coming-of-age tale. Homer (Maguire) is an orphan who becomes like a son to the doctor (Caine) who runs the orphanage. I identified with the theme of needing to leave home to see the world and form your own identity. Homer meets a young soldier (Rudd), just ready to serve in WWII, and the soldier's fiancé (Theron), who show him the ocean and arrange for a job as an apple picker. The migrant workers are of various minorities, and though we don't get to know many of them very well, this portion of the story reminded me of John Steinbeck (Dickens is also alluded to at times). The title comes from a list of rules posted in the workers' housing. Even though it is a slippery slope, I was right with Mr. Rose (Lindo) when he questioned whether rules written by the powerful are really for those with no power or if we must create our own rules. There seemed to be a subtext questioning sacred laws here. Well, Homer fights the fact that he is a skilled doctor (with informal training) because he doesn't want to follow his adoptive father's footsteps. Homer also has youthful ideals, yet as he faces some tough challenges, he begins to realize how complicated the world is ethically. He begins to find his place in the world. There are some lovely scenes that show characters appreciating good literature and fun film-going experiences.

Photography and overall directing are GREAT all the way through, delivering a nostalgic feeling of peace, mainly due to the simplistic yet complex subject we're given. Other than that, even thought I tend to enjoy dramatic stories that aren't filled with melodramatic situations, sometimes the lack of boldness in this plot frustrated me. I mean, maybe a stronger moment between the doctor and Homer would've made it a lot more memorable.

The script based on the book by John Irving seems to have been put on the chopping block so that there is no narrative flow, just bits and pieces and dramatic overtures.The movie begins in the 1940s at a New England orphanage run by the benevolent Dr. Larch (Michael Caine). He shepherds over the flock of young children waiting for a new set of parents to come and adopt them. To lift their spirits he reads them a bedtime story and them bids them good night with 'Goodnight you princes of Maine, you kings of New England'. Dr. Larch's orphanage also doubles as an abortion clinic, which he feels provides a service from backalley coat hanger butchers.Dr. Larch more or less adopts one of the orphans and names him Homer Wells. He takes the boy under his wing and teaches him everything he knows about medicine. Homer's stance on abortion seems reasonable &#x96; he believes in abortion only in the cases of incest and rape. Eventually, Homer grows restless and wants to venture into the world by himself. A man named Wally (Paul Rudd) and his girlfriend Candy (Charleze Theron) come to the orphange for an abortion and befriend Homer and take him back to their apple orchard.It's about here that the movie becomes so predictable that we can count every step. We meet the leader of the working crew Mr. Rose (Delroy Lindo and his daughter Rose Rose (Erykah Badu) and knowing that Homer's stance on abortion is limited to incest and rape, we know that soon this issue will come up. Wally goes off to fight in WWII and Homer is left to spend time with Candy. Candy is a smoldering beauty and now has a boyfriend overseas so we don't have to guess that between she and Homer, nature will take its course. The problem with this is that the movie never really conflicts their romance in any real way, it just seems to abbreviate it and wrap it up at the end as if it has to be punctuated.There is never a sense of observation in 'The Cider House Rules', the script jumps from one major plot point to the next without ever really allowing us time to get there. It's like an abbreviated edition of a great novel that includes all of the major developments but edits out all that is in between. I'm not sure what the point of the movie is and I'm not sure that the filmmakers could tell me either.

Round two of giving it a go, and only motivated by the fact it won an Oscar for its screen writing and I guess Caine's second Oscar, I was quite pleasantly surprised at first. It's much more cinematic and iconic than I expected, rather than being derivative of the sentimental scope of a film such as Forrest Gump. It wasn't necessarily great, it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, but that kings of maine line is familiar. I can't say that Caine deserved his award over Tom Cruise, Haley Joel Osment and Michael Clark Duncan, but it could have been a bigger crime.While it has a handful of potentially effective moments which is entirely down to the pleasant surprising conviction of its otherwise unsuspecting cast, it's all squashed in favour of a forced tearjerking attempt at sentimentality which results in an eye roll. The plot begins its windy path to nowhere and it feels terribly formless and unfocused, just a checklist of themes and scenes. The script has a relatively good sense of drama but the way certain things are approached feel nonsensical, especially when we're supposed to buy that Tobey Maguire would confront a big black man about an incestual relationship. I know story lines were cut, but it still feels too densely packed, like three movies in one.

Irving's a master storyteller, of course, and the post-Dickensian plot developments (infidelity, incest, abortion, crippling illness, suicide) are resolved very efficiently, just in time for Homer to do what he has to do. The moral issues presented by the story aren't pressed too hard and tend to be treated in a skittish, Hollywoodish way. (Citizen Ruth it ain't.) It's not really made explicit, but there's an interesting zenlike contradiction between Homer's rejection of the cider house rules (basically any sort of arbitrary order imposed from above) and his mentor's attempts to control his future, on the one hand, and the decision he finally comes to, on the other (no spoilers here!). Toby McGuire's minimal acting style is perfect for the part; Caine's croaking New England accent, Theron's tomboyish beauty and the crisp New England landscapes all make a contribution.

It's as if director Lasse Hallstrom was begging for an Oscar. Well, he didn't get it.But for some reason, the film was nominated for seven Oscars, including Best Picture, director, supporting actor (Caine, who won), and adapted screenplay (which also won, for some reason). Maybe on paper, this sounds like quite the film. But on screen, it sort of falls apart. I was sort of bored to death, waiting for more moments with Michael Caine.Caine won the Oscar over Tom Cruise in Magnolia. While watching this movie, I tried to wrap my head around just why he won. I'll tell you why Because he's Michael friggin' Caine. He's fantastic, and he's not bad in this movie, but he really didn't blow me away. He is in it for about twenty minutes. Okay, fine, more like forty. But it's not like he gets a scene worthy of an Oscar here. Cruise is amazing in Magnolia, and I know Caine is amazing, but Cruise is even more amazing in that movie.Overall, I just don't really like the movie. Now and then I find an Oscar nominee that I just don't really care about. Les Miserables, Beasts of the Southern Wild, Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close, The Blind Side, Good Will Hunting, Good Night and Good Luck, and The Music Man are among the nominees that I don't really like. This one joins them. It just sort of sits there for two hours. Oh well, at least it didn't win.C "},{"Title":"Review of The Cider House Rules","Date":"16 June 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" The Cider House Rules was released in 1999 by Miramax Studios. Set in the late 1930's during World War II, this Drama filled story introduces us to Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine), a prominent obstetrician at St. Cloud's Orphanage in rural Maine. Dr. Larch's journey through this film will bring him happiness, expose his weaknesses, and stir up century old controversies still debated in modern society. Dr. Larch has seen many children come and go through the doors of St. Cloud's, more come, than go. He is particularly interested in one orphan he delivered and named him Homer Wells (Tobey McGuire). Returned to the orphanage several times by different foster homes, Homer finds himself growing up under the father like care of Dr. Larch, who takes Homer under his wing and begins teaching him about medicine including obstetrics. As a young man, Homer provides medical services at St. Clouds that he learned from Dr. Larch to the women of Maine, but refuses to participate in the abortions that Dr. Larch provides to unwed and unwinding mothers. Homer also provides the love and comfort to the younger orphans as he received from Dr. Larch. After an unexpected pregnancy, Candy Wells (Charlize Theron) and Lt. Wally Worthington (Paul Rudd) find themselves at the doorstep of St. Cloud's for Dr. Larch's services, and when they leave, Homer decides to hitch a ride, leaving the orphanage and his medical commitments to Dr. Larch behind. Wally offers Homer an apple picking job on his family's farm with head picker Arthur Rose (Delroy Lindo) and his daughter Rose Rose (Erykah Badu), and quickly learns the value of manual labor which seems to gratify his internal need for self-actualization. Wally heads off to fight in the War, and Candy and Homer begin to fall in love over the next year. Meanwhile, Dr. Larch has been asked to step down at the orphanage, so he falsifies medical degrees in hopes that Homer will return to take his rightful place. Homer and Dr. Larch exchange heated letters as Homer explains his happiness outside of the orphanage, and Dr. Larch tries to convince Homer that medicine is his calling. Homer discovers that Mr. Rose has impregnated his own daughter, and convinces Rose Rose to allow him to perform an abortion on her so she doesn't hurt herself. Wally returns injured from the War, and Candy has chosen to be with him despite Homer's pleads. Homer hears of dreadful news from the orphanage, and has to make a life changing decision that will ultimately dictate the rest of his life. Oliver Stapleton (cinematographer) was able to capture the feelings and emotions throughout this film. His choice of lighting and camera angles during the knife fight between Mr. Rose, and one of his apple pickers, really brought out the emotions and fear of both men, even thru the rain and confusion. In Roger Eberts 1999 review of this film, he criticized Tobey McGuire's performance as Homer Wells as being monotone. I think that Homer Wells was a character that needed a calmer actor like Tobey, and I felt that his performance really demonstrated how someone who was sheltered for so long, and is experiencing new things all at once, could be overwhelmed and excited at the same time. Overall, I really enjoyed this film. I was quickly able to appreciate the characters for who they were, and found common ground with some decisions that were made by the characters throughout the film. Each scene brought a different level of energy and excitement, as well as shame and distrust. This was an emotional film that I think future viewers will enjoy as it is full of controversy, hope, and fulfillment.

Tobey Maquire plays the orphan, Homer Wells, who after several failed adoptions, is brought up by the doctor in charge of the orphanage, Dr. Larch, played by Michael Caine. Set in 1930's Maine, during a period where abortions are illegal, Dr. Larch raises and trains Homer to perform both child births and abortions in an endeavor to save women seeking a way out of children from being operated on by less educated and more criminal abortionists looking to make a quick dollar.Homer struggles with the decision to aid young women in performing abortions, even while Dr. Larch points out the need for their assistance, as without the aid of properly trained individuals, these women risk not only the lives of the child, but their own. Dr. Larch points out that the female should be willing to make the choice for herself while Homer is left believing it is only okay for an abortion to be performed in the case of rape or incest(Dr. Larch and Homer take opposite stances similar to those found today in pro-choice versus pro-life politics). The story becomes murkier as Homer becomes friends with the young couple of Wally, played by Paul Rudd, and Candy, played by the lovely Charlize Theron. This new found friendship leads Homer away from the orphanage for the first time in his adult life to the apple farm own by Wally's family, where he works hard and is able to relax. Homer become close friends with the other workers on the farm including a Mr. Rose and his daughter, Rose Rose. As Wally heads off to fight in the war, Homer and Candy find themselves embroiled in a love story of their own, placing them both in a sticky situation. As this love story unfolds, the past rears its' ugly head as Homer Discovers that Rose had been impregnated through incest and now he must decide whether or not to offer her the opportunity for an abortion, bringing the theme of the film full circle.The theme of the film, while taking place in the 1930's is still extremely relative in the present time and deals with a subject that is considered some what taboo in society today. Overall, it is a thought perplexing film, filled with inspiring acting, beautiful scenery and a refreshing look into the past while still provoking emotional response from the audience today!

It had stiff competition for the Oscars in 2000, it definitely deserved the Best Picture nomination if not the award itself. "},{"Title":"With a strong story, The Cider House Rules has that intangible period piece magic","Date":"29 September 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" It's exactly not easy for a period film to feel magical, and this is something The Cider House Rules achieves almost instantly. No single element of the film feels completely original or totally inspired, but the entire package crafted by Lasse Hallstrom and John Irving has the fairy tale quality that Oscar contenders are made of.Component number one the voice-over narration. Michael Caine, who plays Dr. Wilbur Larch, is a narrator comparable to Morgan Freeman in The Shawshank Redemption, and that's not a comparison to be drawn lightly. Caine's words (credit to the script noted) set the ideal tone for this kind of a drama, and the story of an orphan who grows up and longs to experience is its lucky recipient.Although his origin story comes in fairy tale fashion, Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire) isn't some child with a special gift or a misunderstood outcast; he's just seemingly fated to not find foster parents. Consequently, Dr. Larch takes Homer under his wing and trains him to be a doctor at St. Cloud, the obstetrics hospital/orphanage in middle-of-nowhere Maine where they all live.Life at St. Cloud is isolated to say the least, and as much as Homer enjoys being a role model to the boys there, he's not ready to just assume the mantle of doctor that Larch has prepared him for. The arrival of a young couple seeking an abortion (St. Cloud had a reputation for performing them illegally), World War II pilot Wally (Paul Rudd) and his girlfriend Candy (Charlize Theron), inspires Homer to see life beyond St. Cloud.The archetypes of The Cider House Rules seem all too familiar, but Homer isn't your typical clueless, naive young man whose world view gets him in trouble though he inspires. Instead, when you consider Homer's regular interactions with women and their anatomy, it's clear he's anything but prude. His sudden departure with Wally and Candy is not an act of rebellion, but of pure curiosity.There's a lot of Peter Parker in Maguire's performance, though to be fair Spider-Man came three years after Cider House. Homer is almost foolishly self assured, and Maguire dials down the wide-eyed wonder you might expect from his character.If we're going to talk performance, however, it's Caine who takes the cake, and deserves his Oscar win. Larch is a loving father figure to Homer, overprotective at times and even hypocritical, a tad jocular and mischievous, but passionate about his work. As our elders so often do, he fails to recognize that Homer needs to experience the world in his own way, even if Larch's wisdom is worth being heeded.Homer's time as an apple-picker and lobster-wrangler seems far from an enviable existence, so it's tough to completely empathize with his choice to abandon St. Cloud, but his blossoming relationship with Candy provides the ultimate justification in love. Homer experiences the loss of innocence he never had in his time living in the cider house, whether it be learning from the workers who he lives with or discovering love through his intimate affair with Candy.During Homer's excursion, there's no question that something will call him back to St. Cloud. Cider House can't get away with hiding anything given its classic story structure and obvious tropes, but it can infuse everything with genuine emotion, and that's where it succeeds. In terms of original thinking, The Cider House Rules does explore notions of family. Whereas most films lean on traditional family values in terms of themes and eliciting emotion from the audience, there's a notion in Cider House that suggests that the biological notion of family isn't all it's cracked up to be, and in some cases can even be detrimental to our well-being. At the same time, Homer learns that role models &#x97; people who care about us wholeheartedly no matter our circumstances &#x97; are the real necessity. Even romance takes a back seat in this notion.Director Lasse Hallstrom presents this story in straight-forward fashion. His strength can be found in the way his style works so well in tandem with Rachel Portman's uplifting score. You could almost say that the tone of the movie dupes you into believing it's Oscar worthy, but because Irving provides such a solid story for the rest of the production, there's no trickery involved. The Cider House Rules is a triumph of writing to be certain.A pleasant drama aside from a few challenging moments, The Cider House Rules has that unmistakable quality of greatness, even in its predictability. It stands as testament to how the familiar can sometimes be a great thing.~Steven CThanks for reading! visit moviemusereviews.com "},{"Title":"Not a feel good film.","Date":"29 July 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" The film Cider House rules deals with many sensitive issues. Abortion, unwanted childbirth, and illegal practice of medicine, are all part of this films theme. Unfortunately this film paints a perfect picture of the way it was during the WWII. The setting is a ran down orphanage during WWII. The overcrowded orphanage is run by one doctor and 2 nurses. It is a gloomy film that tells about the life of an unwanted orphan named Homer Wells.

Just as you come to grips with the pro-choice abortion messaging, the incestuous relationship between the apple picker and his daughter hits you like a ton of bricks. The grandfatherly patriarch of St. Cloud's (Michael Caine) turns to deception, not only to bring back his protégé (Tobey Maguire), but it's also revealed at the end of the film that he lied about Homer's heart condition as a ruse to keep him from leaving in the first place. On top of that, the fiancée (Charlize Theron) of the war hero (Paul Rudd) rationalizes her affair with Homer because of her loneliness, but in an out of character turn at the finale, decides to reunite with the paralyzed flyer.

Wilbur is a doctor that performs abortion's which was highly frowned upon during this era. Homer learns the ropes while still yearning to experience the real world outside of the orphanage, all while Wilbur dreams that Homer will partner with him and ultimately takeover when he is gone. The theme of this film is that your heart always brings you back to where you're supposed to be. For example, Homer enjoyed leaving the orphanage and falling in love with Charlize Theron's character Candy, but knew in the end he had a responsibility to the patients and children of the orphanage and returned. Homer had the chance to experience life outside of his normal routine and realized that his abilities and gift to be able to help women in need when faced with an unwanted child was bigger than being in love for a short period of time. During Homer's journey working on the apple farm he is forced to help a young woman named Rose. Rose was raped by her father (Delroy Lindo), and Homer performs the abortion on Rose so that she does not have to live with the memory of her father molesting her throughout her lifetime. After the surgery is over Rose runs from the apple farm without looking back, after her father realized he ruined a large part of her life, he takes his own life. While these dramatic events are taking place Homer is informed that the other man in Candy's life Wally (Paul Rudd) is coming back from serving in the military, because he was injured and is paralyzed from the waist down. Once Homer realizes that Candy needs to be there for Wally he decides to return to the orphanage and use his gift of surgery to good use. The lighting in this film is more high-key because many scenes are taking place in an infirmary type location. The lights are bright so the audience can further their imagination to the stress and realism to what these women and medical staff are experiencing. Also the angle used during the film is mainly filmed straight on, because the lack of action packed scenes. This film is realistic, so to really get the audience involved it is best to keep it simple and believable. A film related to the theme of The Cider House Rules is another film directed by Hallstrom, What's Eating Gilbert Grape. These two films revolve around being there for your friends and family when needed. Hallstrom does an excellent job portraying that you have to take the good with the bad in both of these films. For example, in The Cider House Rules Homer knows that abortion is frowned upon but outweighs the bad and thinks of the women faced with the issue. In What's Eating Gilbert Grape this family would not be considered a normal family, but this family sticks together through the good and the bad. Overall, these films both portray that every situation can have a positive or negative result but in the end your heart will lead you where you need to be.

The movie was directed by Lasse Hallstrom, who demonstrated experience and skills to adapt a bestseller book into an academy award winner film in 1999. The movie has a great cast starting Tobey Maguire as Homer Wells, Charlize Theron as Candy Kendall, Michael Caine as Dr. Wilbur Larch, Delroy Lindo as Arthur Rose, and others. The plot of the movie is centralized through a lifetime decision of Homer, who begins his journey as an non-adaptable orphan at St Cloud, Maine. Homer Wells a brilliant young man, who has never attended school, is experiencing full medical knowledge by the director of the orphanage Dr. Larch.The Cider House Rules' theme can be represented by abortion, which is a major moral issue for our society. Dr. Larch playing a strong character for the movie, and he is a major character contributor to the abortion theme, Homer plays as anti-abortionist in the movie, but still practicing medicine without licensing and proper education. Nurses are helping Dr Larch, but they never expressed their thoughts about abortion and believe for allowing a young man to practice medicine.The movie takes different turns, for instance Home leaving the orphanage to see the world. However, Homer working on the orchard learns things such as friendship, love, courage. However, the incident with Arthur Rose takes him back to the orphanage environment of abortion, medicine, justice, life, etc. Cider House Rules can be compared with American History X, the theme of the movie is not abortion, but it is racism. Racism is a moral topic that for many years society has viewed as an obstacle for social happiness.Cider House Rules is impressive in the use of lightning and sound. First, lightning is used throughout the movie, it is noted when Homer is walking out and heading to the insemination after an abortion is performed. It was getting dark, but it allowed seeing Homer's face of sadness, and anger due to the spare of a human life. Second, the sound is key for the movie's theme. Again, the orphanage setting helps the movie to give a natural feeling of that era. It was primarily the women crying for pain after the abortion procedure, their cry represented physical pain as well as moral pain.Lastly, the movie is great to watch. Moral issues such as abortion takes time to digest while watching a movie with such theme. However, it allows exploring different feelings and thoughts about the matter. It is up to the viewer discretion to interpret the movie as they please.

Dr Larch makes numerous choices throughout the film that impact his and others lives he chooses to work at an orphanage; he chooses to treat Homer as his son, but most importantly, Dr. Larch teaches Homer how to deliver babies and to perform abortions. All of this is done in order to make Homer of use and helpful to others. But as he moves into adulthood, Homer believes his usefulness is beyond the weekly movie nights and the occasional pie dough overdose that the orphanage offers. He is eternally grateful for the education Dr. Larch has given him, but he longs for worldly experience. He longs for a life separate from ether-scented delivery rooms and the daily trips to the incinerator to dispose of human remains. Most importantly, he wants a reality that does not include abortion. This disagreement regarding the medical procedure was also part of the reason he wanted to leave the orphanage and escape the specter of his philosophical and pedagogical father, Dr. Larch. But in the end, it was also the thing that brought him back. During his time away he performs an abortion for a young girl named Rose, who was impregnated by her father. She did not want to have the baby so he offered to help her. He does this not because he wants to encourage her to have an abortion, but because he wants her to know that she has a choice. He wants Rose to know that regardless of race, gender, class, or the current law, she indeed had the same type of choice he exercised when he chose not to perform abortions. And having this choice, like it did for him, will make her impervious to any type of pressure or coercion that is used to try and force her into doing something she is morally opposed to doing. The day Homer chose to leave the orphanage he was confronted with the often grim, unpleasant truths and realities that the world he so coveted offered. After performing an abortion, experiencing heartbreak, and the unfortunate death of Dr. Larch, Homer realizes that by returning to the orphanage and replacing him he would actually make the world a better place. He could continue the legacy of Dr. Larch and care for the future Princes of Maine and the Kings of New England and be of use to them and anyone else who desired his assistance. In the end, this is what he felt he had to do. Indeed, this was his choice.One of the most fascinating aspects of the film is the costume design. Unfortunately, despite the film's seven Oscar nominations, Renee Ehrlich Kalfus's costume design was not one of them. Renee's work truly evoked the time period. The dresses and outfits worn by Candy and Mrs. Worthington (Wally's mother) were fashionable and trendy. The clothes these women wore defined their status. On the other hand, the clothes worn by Homer, the kids at the orphanage, and the apple pickers were drab and plain which is very similar to their status and view of the world. Another omission the Academy made was in regard to the film's cinematography. Oliver Stapleton's lighting crew bathed most of this film in natural light. The numerous exterior scenes demanded this and it was his responsibility to capture the wondrous beauty of New England in its natural state. The snowball fights and the frequent journeys to the incinerator did not require any artificial light. The interior scenes deserved and received the same treatment. Although in the scenes that had little natural light, like the scene in which Homer and Candy are alone in the apple picker's quarters, Stapleton used low-key lighting which makes Homer and Candy's shadows dance as they roll around in the bed. Stapleton's cinematography is also exemplary for its evocative compositions. A perfect example of this is the scene at the empty drive-in that features a shot of Candy and Homer cuddled in the front seat. Homer has never been to a drive-in before and is overwhelmed by experience but Candy explains that people do not usually go to the drive-in to watch the movie. Stapleton is able to capture the tenderness of the scene as Candy forces Homer's arm around her shoulder. The moment is innocent, romantic, but also foreshadows the nature of their relationship their budding romance must be kept a secret. The choices we make have consequences. Although they wanted to be together, Candy and Homer realized that it was not possible. Despite their behavior, Candy was still committed to Wally and Homer still felt a responsibility to Dr. Larch and the orphanage. Once Homer learned that Dr. Larch died and Candy found out that Wally had been hurt, the choices they needed to make became clear. Candy chose Wally, marriage, and respectability; while Homer chose St. Cloud and responsibility.

The theme consists of a boy growing up in a orphanage and is taken under the wing of the director (doctor) of the facility and trained to be a doctor in obstetrics and is looking for something different in life. He finds out that life is complex and finally decides to return to the orphanage, because he realizes that it is meant for him to be a doctor like his mentor. Throughout the film Homer befriends Wally Worthington (Paul Rudd) and Candy Kendall (Charlize Theron) and leaves the orphanage with them after Candy receives an abortion. They take Homer to their family's apple orchid where he works. Then Wally goes overseas during World War II. Homer and Candy begins to have an affair. Wally's plane is shot down and returns home paralyzed. Homer is picking apples with black workers and is staying at the Worthington Estate in the Cider House. The workers are supervised by Arthur Rose (Delroy Lindo). Mr. Rose gets his own daughter pregnant named Rose Rose (Erykah Badu). Homer does not do abortions, but eventually does one in Rose's case. She wants to leave and she stabs her father, because she thought he was trying to touch her. Arthur tells Homer and another worker to tell the law that it was a suicide. Homer learns of Dr. Larch's death due to an overdose of ether and decides to return to the St. Cloud Orphanage and takes his place there. Another film by Irving is The World According to Garp which has an appropriateness to theme. This consists of love, drama,and tragedy. Thus, showing some similarities of the two films. The lighting of The Cider House Rules seems to show the relevance of the theme in regards to the mood and atmosphere. The orphanage lighting seems somewhat dim to display the underfunding and sadness of the parent less children. However, there was a good portion of natural light. The natural light that appears in the outdoor scenes and in the cider house; shows that there is friendship, love and just the warm feeling of the environment. The Motif of the film which included mainly the beauty of the natural environment along with the sounds and the array of beautiful colors that constantly appears throughout the film. The theme consists a great deal of morale issues and complexity of relationships.

The Cider House Rules begins with review of our main characters, Homer Wells played by Toby Maguire, life up to the point of him living in an orphanage as a sort of father figure to the others. The head Doctor and program director for the orphanage is Dr. Wilbur Larch, played by Michael Caine, who provides a consistent and safe environment for the children. As Homer is taught under the care of Dr Larch a young couple, Candy and Wally played by Charlize Theron and Paul Rudd, come in to the orphanage to receive an abortion. Homer, wanting to experience life, asks to ride along with them and so the story takes off as he attempts to experience life and catch up on everything that he feels he has missed.In this film we follow Homer as he attempts to experience all that life has to offer. I believe that we can all relate to Homer's sense of adventure and openness to life. As Homer and Candy begin an intimate relationship we can remember the excitement and youth that they are experiencing. Even while Candy and Homer are forced to part ways due to obligation, we see the heart break in both of their eyes. I see similarities in this film and Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, as a young love is broken apart, not by choice, but by confusion and obligation.I found many significant cinematographically based techniques throughout this film that set the mood and reinforced the story line. With the nurses and doctors in the orphanage we see them in nothing other than white. This white gives a sense of dullness and safety. Homer would live a simple, safe life if he were to stay at the orphanage. On the other side, we see Candy and Wally ride in with a new flashy green car, as Candy is wearing bright red lipstick. Wally and Candy represent life and risk, which Homer grasps on to as it drives him from the orphanage out in to the world. The other technique that the producer and cinematographers use is angles. When the orphanage is shown, we are always looking up the hill at it, almost in a majestic manner. On the other end, when we see images of the train leaving the orphanage or views of the orchard we see a downward camera view, almost demeaning in purpose. Both of these techniques help the producer display their meaning to the audience with small visual underlining. Throughout the film it is fairly evident that Homer will, eventually, return back to the orphanage due to the manner with which we view the origin. We view the orphanage as home and never see Homer settle in anywhere else. That is also why we have a deep feeling that Homer will find heartbreak in the arms of Candy, as he experiences the greatness and misery of life.

There are a lot of themes in here that are apparent for a great memorable film - finding your purpose, entering the world and discovering yourself, issues of abortion and the beauty of life itself.Tobey Maguire's character of Homer Wells was a likable one and so is his father figure Dr Walch played by Michael Caine. Somehow however, it felt as though this was a story of a journey that was bound to get to its conclusion without much of a need to explain it in great detail. No real resolution is really there besides from the theme of 'there's no place like home' or 'i was better off where i was meant to be'. I could see this as well long before it was to happen.The film is beautiful in its landscape and music. Somehow though I wasn't connected so much with the orphans probably because you don't know them as much as you would like. What was the most interesting storyline within this story was the apple picking role Homer adventures into and the black workers he stays with and has a love interest with Charlize Theron. While it all felt real, the conclusions of it are somewhat ambiguous and is more concerned with hiding its feelings and making you dig around for them.The beauty of the film however does capture your interest and it does make for a nice pleasant viewing. But I didn't find this as depressing or as moving as it should have been.

Homer leaves the orphanage with Candy Kendall (Charlize Theron) and Lt. Wally Worthington (Paul Rudd) a young couple that comes to the orphanage for an abortion, to find his own way in the world. Life circumstances eventually bring Homer home to the orphanage where he finally agrees to take Dr. Larch's place as the doctor at the orphanage.This movie is a coming of age movie centered on the idea that you should not judge the actions taken by others in a situation that you have never been in and are not likely to understand. Similarly the affair between two of the main characters Homer and Candy while Wally is away at war can also be seen as a situation that others are unlikely to understand because they are not in the same situation. The inappropriate relationship between Homer and Candy is similar to the inappropriate relationship between a teenager and her best friend's father in the coming of age movie American Beauty.The motif in this film is seen repeatedly in the situation with Mr. Rose (Delroy Lindo) and his daughter Rose Rose (Erykah Badu), in that like the abortions Dr. Larch is performing for the women who come to the orphanage a person is unlikely to understand their distinct situation and therefore should not judge. This is apparent in Mr. Rose's comment to Homer about the situation with Rose Rose, This ain't your business. The lighting in The Cider House Rules is very soft and subtle, almost muted in the beginning of the film when Homer is living at the orphanage and then becomes brighter and crisper when he goes out into the world and finds himself. Like the theme of the movie the lighting is softer and more muted when Homer is still a young boy but as he grows and comes of age and his path becomes more clear to him, the lighting brightens and becomes clearer as well. This film is rife with moral ambiguity and will have you questioning your stance on everything from abortion to infidelity; however it is not my place to judge. "}{"Title":"The Cider House Rules Review and Synopsis","Date":"3 February 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" Adapted from the book by John Irving, this coming of age film is set in the early 1940's. America was still recovering from the Great Depression when we became involved WWII. Men were off at war while women entered the workforce to replace those men. The Cider House Rules occurs in two settings St. Clouds and the orphanage and an apple orchard in the small farming town of Cape Kenneth. At the orphanage, people visit to either adopt a child or receive an illegal abortion. Michael Caine, as Dr. Larch, runs the orphanage. Tobey Maguire plays Dr. Larch's protégé, Homer Wells. Dr. Larch, having raised Homer, wishes Homer to replace him as head of the orphanage. Homer, desiring to spread his wings and find his place in the world, leaves the orphanage to find his own dreams. Homer and Dr. Larch have one major area in which they disagree the right for women to obtain an abortion. Throughout the film, as Homer engages in a love affair with a Candy Kendall (played by Charlize Theron) whose boyfriend is off at war, Homer and Dr. Larch continue this disagreement via the postal service. Eventually, Homer must confront his beliefs when he is faced with a young lady who is pregnant by her father. Homer's heart grows three sizes that day, and once Dr. Larch has passed, he returns to the orphanage to fulfill the role Dr. Larch always wanted him to fill.Unlike other coming of age films like The Graduate, the navel gazing Homer does is more about society and individual rights rather than deciding trivial things (in comparison) such as what career or personal relationship to pursue. Similar to The Graduate, the film uses the vehicle of a love story to unfold the plot of a young man's search for self. As Homer becomes involved with Candy, he experiences the irony of having a sexual relationship and not worrying about consequences. While Homer does not impregnate Candy, he still faces a difficult pregnancy decision in the form of Rose Rose (played by Erykah Badu). Rose is impregnated by her father and (obviously) does not wish to have the baby. Her father will not let her leave, she cannot take care of a baby, and she considers taking care of it herself. Homer, having seen the horrific results of botched abortions, makes the decision to help Rose and performs the abortion himself. It is at this point that Homer realizes that the world is imperfect and if women insist on abortion they should be able to receive them safely.The film was shot on location and therefore uses natural sources when possible. Additionally, the film stock and filters used give the scenes a softness that hearkens back to simpler times and life in the country. This softness also helps detract from the harshness of the abortion debate running throughout the film. The lighting and filters softens everything just enough to allow the viewer to sit back and enjoy the film without becoming too uncomfortable watching abortions occur and allowing the viewer to relax and discover how Homer's search for meaning unfolds.

Dr. Larch is a physician for an orphanage in Maine. Homer is an orphan who was adapted many times but was returned each time. After Homer is returned for the last time Dr. Larch takes Homer under his wing and teaches him to be a doctor and how to deliver as well as abort babies. This becomes a major theme of the movie Dr. Larch keeps trying to convince Homer that it is a good thing to help women abort their unwanted babies but Homer does not agree and refuses. Homer keeps trying to escape this but through out the film he keeps getting pulled back to it. Homer Spends much of the film trying to run from this destiny but life it seems has another purpose for him as we see later in the film.When a young couple, Wally and Candy played by Paul Rudd and Charlize Theron come to the orphanage to have an abortion, Homer leaves with them to see the world. Wally gets called off to war and Candy and Homer have an affair. When Wally returns from the war, Homer leaves and lives with migrant workers picking Apples.While living with the migrant workers Homer discovers that Arthur, one of the migrant workers had impregnated his own daughter. Homer realizes that even though he did not previously believe in abortion, that he needed to give Arthurs daughter an abortion. Shortly after this, Homer learns that Dr. Larch has died and he returns to the orphanage where he takes over for Dr. Larch as the director and physician of the orphanage.This movie is a set during the mid 1930's-1940's during the war, this is the motif of the movie. One of the nice touches of the movie is the lighting, a great use of natural lighting is used in the movie, this gives the scenes a natural and more somber feel. The themes in this movie are really what make it interesting. The theme of abortion is controversial, especially in the setting of the movie when it was illegal but also to see someone struggle against their apparent destiny only to be brought back to it and to embrace it was really what draws you into this film.

"},{"Title":"Wow, What a great movie!","Date":"19 September 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" The Cedar House Rules is definitely a movie you would want to see. The movie has a great story line and even better actors. If you are used to movies that are in color, you will have doubts about this movie when it first comes on. This movie starts off Black and White, and then will change to color. The two colors will then switch between the two extremes throughout the film. My advice have patience and don't rule this movie out, you will have missed out on a classic. While there are many great characters in the movie, the main characters include Tobey Maguire who played Homer Wells, Charlize Theron who played Candy Kendall, Paul Rudd who played Lt. Wally Worthington, and Michael Caine who played Dr. Wilbur Larch.The Cedar House is about Homer Wells who didn't have any direction in life. He had been raised in an orphanage and never saw anything outside the four walls of the building. The only reality he had was the movie that they were able to see every Friday. The proof that Homer never went anywhere is that Homer didn't even know what the ocean looked like. He never knew what a drive-in movie looked like, until Candy took him to one. And lastly, he had never seen an apple tree, until he got a job at Wally's mothers business, picking apples.The Cedar House Rules is centered on Homer Wells. Homer was an orphan at St. Cloud orphanage, at which place, he was adopted and then returned to the orphanage four times. After the fourth time returned back to the orphanage, Dr. Wilbur Larch who was a Doctor at the orphanage decided to raise him and taught Homer how to be a Doctor. Dr. Larch taught Homer how to deliver babies and how to perform abortions (which Homer refused to perform). The movie takes a different turn when Wally brings his girlfriend Candy in to have an abortion. At this time, Homer interviews both of them in a room and tells them that Dr. Larch will perform the procedure. After Candy has the procedure and is resting, Homer looks out the window and sees Wally standing outside next to his car. Homer than mustards up the strength to ask Wally can he leave with him and Candy when they leave. After Wally said yes, the rest is history. Wally goes back to the Military and Homer and Candy fall in love. Homer then meets Rose Rose who was an apple picker, who ends up getting impregnated by her own father. Homer, who wants to help her, finds himself giving her something that he vowed he wasn't going to perform, an abortion. He then realizes that he is a Doctor (unlicensed), and goes back to the St. Cloud orphanage and becomes the Doctor there when Dr. Larch died.Another film that is close in appropriateness is The lover. The two movies are similar because while The Cedar House Rules is based out of an orphanage, The Lover is based out of a boarding school. While Homer falls in love with Candy, Jane March falls in love with a Chinaman (Tony Leung Ka Fai). Both Homer and Jane fell in love with someone thinking they would feel the void that is within them, and they both were wrong. The issue with both of them was deeper. They needed to address the issue of loneliness that had been there since their abandonment. And the last similarity between the two movies is that both relationships didn't end with a happy ending. They both wanted the relationship to continue, which the other partners didn't.The lightning in the movie was subtle. The movie used very little artificial light. The movie mainly utilized natural light. For example, in the scene when Homer was reading to the other children in the orphanage, the light in the room was off. But since the room had windows, you could actually see the light gleaming in through the windows, thus creating a shadowing effect in the room. In the scenes where the landscape was outside, such as when Homer was at the drive-in with Candy, natural light was utilized also.The angles that were used in this movie varied greatly. In the scene where Homer and Candy were having sex outside, the angle was from the side and then moved to the top of them. In this scene the camera remain in a close-up position. In the scene were the kids from the orphanage played in the snow outside, the camera keep at a distance. The angle continually changed. The angled looked as though it was moving around the children. It was as though the director wanted us to see exactly how many children were playing outside.In conclusion, this was a great film to review. The movie will make you laugh at times and it will also make you cry at times. If you like movies that are reality based, you will love this movie. Young Homer that was unwanted in life and told that he would never make it out in the real world figure out one thing on his own, that he wanted to be doctor. He chose to do, what he fought so hard not to do, abortions. So sit back, relax, and enjoy the film. "},{"Title":"It doesn't rule, but it's pretty good","Date":"7 September 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" As a constantly changing film, The Cider House Rules touches on many important themes, most of which are concurrently significant and interesting. The script may initially offer the guise of a film about a young man's challenging development when introduced to the unfamiliar outside world. Despite this, ultimately the premise is far simpler (and, consequently for Homer (Tobey Maguire), far more complicated) it is about the choices we make and the extent to which we will follow our principles (or rules) when functioning in the world.In essence, what is the limit to our personal adherence?Homer's belief regarding abortion is that people as a collective should demonstrate some restraint. Dr. Lurch (Michael Caine) is far less authoritarian in his reserves, thinking that people as a collective should have a choice with what to do with their own bodies. But even to the detriment of other possible beings? Human life? These are the relevant moral questions on the matter.To have never been born may be the greatest boon of all, Lurch might have argued; however, as it is, this film is far less philosophical in its debates, simply presenting the facts instead of the metaphors. This is not to say that the discussions lack depth, they are just more direct.In any case, though Homer is strong in his beliefs and refuses to even assist his loving mentor Dr. Lurch in such a procedure, by the end of the film Homer will have performed an abortion convinced, just as the audience is, that it was the only possible course of action. The event that sways Homer's judgement to this decision is the pivotal moment of the film, where it differs itself from others about love found, love pursued, love lost, lesson learned. At this moment, Cider House becomes more unexpectedly mature.This instance in question is perpetrated by a young girl, Rose, working at the Cider House and her desperate situation she has been impregnated by her seemingly-gentle father, the African-American superior of the Cider House, Arthur Rose. Candy informs Homer of this who, after contemplation, steps in to perform the necessary procedure. He does this because he believes that's exactly what it is necessary.As can be seen, this is quite a nice film of deceptively horrible and quite depressing subject matter, intermittently strewn with uplifting beauty, whether it be Michael Caine's brilliantly subtle performance as the lovable father-figure to Homer, or the director, Lasse Hallström's, attractive portrayal of the ever-present New England country-side and the pure clarity of its coast, often the most positive feature during times of uncertainty and dismay throughout the film. This theme of abortion, however, is an essential component of Cider House, prompting Homer to learn more vital and less clichéd lessons of life in a smaller time frame.Homer's discoveries during his brief journey span across many varying topics, such as love; in particular, his love for Candy (Charlize Theron). While their affair instigates much of the subsequent happenings in the film, it should not be considered a primary element, just simply another of Homer's experiences, stating that perhaps in the right circumstances it is more important to be needed and not loved yet still love that which needs you.Homer also learns the value of forgiveness, or at least pity, for those who have done wrong in his sympathy for Arthur Rose on his untimely deathbed. After her procedure, Rose leaves the Cider House, fatally stabbing her father when he attempts to interfere. Bleeding to death and panting heavily, Arthur calmly tells Homer to inform the authorities that his death was self-induced, nothing to do with his wayward daughter. It can be seen quite clearly from Homer's sorrowful gaze that he does indeed pity this poor dying man. Maybe the basis of this reaction is that of Homer's favourite movie, King Kong, in which a misunderstand creature expresses its love through ferocious means, intending only to prove its affection, never to harm, though still inadvertently doing so. Perhaps that is why Homer can feel for this man, because he believes that he honestly meant no harm.At the end of the film, Homer returns to the orphanage after little more than 15 months away on his revelatory expedition; his return is prompted by the accidental ether overdose of Dr. Lurch. The conclusion, which entails Homer taking up Lurch's esteemed position at the institution, may imply the presence of fate or destiny in this film; that it was always meant to be. Not so this is simply the reaction of a choice which leads to a destination and, with any luck, more to experience and expand upon.

Homer leaves with Candy (Charlize Theron) and goes on life journey to realize who he wants to be.This movie is about a boy who has had practically nothing but still has a good head on his shoulders. All he really wants to do is find his own place in the world. Dr. Larch owns the orphanage and he also does illegal abortions on the side. Candy comes into the picture when she comes to get an abortion. Homer is the doctors help in the clinic, but he refuses to do abortions. The doctor believes he is helping the women and the children so that the children do not have to grow up without a home. Homer refuses to believe growing up where he did is worse than never experiencing life. Ironically, abortion is what brought Homer and Candy together. The film brought in several different emotions and was very powerful. The costumes and even the props down to pictures on the walls were believably from the 40's time period. Everything down to the lighting was perfect to portray this period and draw you in. By using a soft colored tone throughout the movie, we were better able to emotionally connect. The lighting was perfect scene by scene. The orphanage is made to look a little darker and more sad. Especially in the scenes where they film the orphans talking at night. The lighting on the beach was bright and made us excited when Homer saw the beach for the first time. They used the right amount of light to portray sadness as they did to portray happiness. The settings always allowed us to relate to the emotions of the movie. I think the settings and lighting went hand in hand in allowing us to feel what they were feeling. The beautiful beach and how it was lighted up so bright and the orphanage and how it was far away and dark and dim are examples of this. The director uses the camera angle nicely and the zoom feature a lot to draw attention to the important parts of scenes. When Homer is the bedroom with Candy everything around him is dark and you can only focus on him while the camera slowly zooms in. The director catches the emotions of the actors with close ups also. Overall I loved this movie. It really did John Irving's book justice. Finding yourself and getting the most out of life as a theme seem to fit perfectly.

Even after memorizing all of the dialogue and knowing how every scene will play out, there is still something about this film that transcends that knowledge and makes every viewing as enjoyable as the last.The story takes place in the 1940's and revolves around an orphan named Homer that resides at the St. Clouds Orphanage He is adopted on separate occasions, but is returned each time, eventually turning an age that makes him undesirable to parents seeking to adopt a child. It is then that the head doctor of the orphanage, Dr. Larch, decides that if Homer is to stay at St. Clouds, he must be of use. Dr. Larch teaches Homer how to perform births, as well as abortions. A couple, Wally and Candy come through seeking the latter and Homer decides to leave the orphanage and travel with them back to their hometown. Homer finds that he enjoys the work in the orchard that Wally's family owns and decides to stay and work there against the wishes of Dr. Larch since he sees Homer as wasting his surgical talents on picking apples. Wally is eventually called to fight in the war and the rest of the story revolves around Homer and Candy's relationship and their relationship with the migrant workers that come through the orchard on a yearly basis.The most striking aspect of The Cider House Rules is in the editing and cinematography. There are no quick cuts to be found here. The shots linger long enough to get a sense of place and setting. The actors actually have to act as opposed to just having to throw up an expression for a few seconds. Michael Caine shines as Dr. Larch and exudes just the right amount of grandfatherly guidance for Homer. Tobey Maguire does a serviceable job playing Homer, and Charlize Theron isn't bad playing Candy. Delroy Lindo is very good as the head of the migrant workers, Mr. Rose.As a final thought, The Cider House Rules should be sought out if you haven't seen it yet, and is a thoughtful drama that is heavy-handed on the pro-life debate, even though it is in there. Those with a strong opinion against abortion will probably not care for the film as much as those that are on the fence or pro-choice. Beyond that, the film is enjoyable due to the good acting and great direction from Lasse Hallstrom.As for those that have read the book know, there are many more developed characters and plot lines in the book, and Homer's time at the Orchard lasts 15 years as opposed to the few that are in the film. But these things obviously had to be cut back for the film, and the makers did a good job of adapting the material for the screen in leaving out what wasn't absolutely necessary to create a film version of John Irving's novel.

About twenty minutes into the film I honestly thought this was going to be so, so dull. There were no new ideas, nothing we hadn't really heard or seen happening before - example is how the lead character struggles to find his place in the world (which is apparently something we need reminding of for the gazillionth time).However, all this aside, it's still one the most poignant and tragically beautiful films to this day. Homer (not the fat yellow guy but Tobey Maguire) is an orphan at St. Clouds in Maine and unlike the other orphans who have moved away or been collected by a family, he has been trained by Dr. Larch (Michael Caine) to be a physician.To Dr. Larch's disappointment, Homer - I'm still not talking about the fat yellow guy, wants more out of life other than delivering babies from women who scream bloody murder. Unsurprisingly. Then by chance a handsome couple arrive who agree to take Homer back with them, where he can live out the dream of picking apples (can you see why I wasn't a huge fan to begin with?).I'm no Sylvester Stallone, so this film didn't struggle to open up the doorway to emotional highway which only Moulin Rouge and Up were capable of doing faster. And a film that can make me reluctant to pause it for simple needs (the dehydration was worth it), must have done a really great job on driving on that highway well.Tobey Maguire, who looks strangely incomplete without his Spider-man costume makes a cliché character seem like a breath of fresh air; Charlize Theron also gives a creditable performance and is quickly becoming one of my most favourite actresses - for the right reason of course. But out of all the cast, Caine seems almost unstoppable in giving another film a primary reason to watch.The Cider House Rules is sweet, without being sickly and simple while being special. I doubt the Goosebumps I got from the ending will ever entirely fade; the mark of a truly touching film.

Afterwards, Homer leaves with them in order to travel and fulfill a yearning of wanting to see the planet. The events of the film take them only to state line, when they finally end up at an apple orchard owned by the airman's mother (Kate Nelligan), but Homer and Candy develop a deep bond in the absence of Wally after he must go to war. Other dramatic events take place, within the film and it takes its viewers on many ups and downs before ending, eventually Dr. Larch passes away and then causes Homer to review his life and what he believes in. This film is an American Classic that uses tricks of cinematography and lighting to create the ambiance wanted in order to allow viewers to fully experience all of the emotions filling this movie. The movie calls to a simpler day and allows the audience to get lost in its idyllic values and lifestyle of the 1940's. This movie is slightly frustrating due to the fact that when all everything seems perfect and to be going right, something happens to create subtle chaos, mixing up the plot and its characters. It was well casted, well directed and well produced. It leaves nothing to be desired, as far as movies of these genera go. The acting makes the film however, without these big names and perfect performances the film could have gone south, quickly. Although the movie was made in 1999, it does an excellent job of rewinding time in order to make the viewers get lost in the simply complex world that was the 1940's.

It is a classy production but does seem a tad muted. Some more energy would have been welcome. Tobey Maguire is fine but the film is capably carried by Michael Caine. Charlize Theron is good as usual in an underwritten role. Delroy Lindo has a complex role but the script doesn't develop it fully. The film tends to deal with the subject matter rather coyly. While this may make it easier to go down with a family audience, it feels like a lost opportunity.

It tells the story of Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire), who leaves the orphanage he grew up and works at an orchard.Homer was the orphan who the orphanage director Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine) treated as a son and taught him to be a gynaecologist. Wilbur hopes that Homer could take his place and run the orphanage. However Homer feels that he needs to leave the orphanage, and having not seen the world outside it. He befriends a young couple and he falls in love with Candy Kendall (Charlize Theron). He works on the family orchard befriends the seasonal workers. Wilbur thinks that Homer is better then that. At the same time their is a moral issue about abortion. Wilbur performs illegal abortions, thinking that its the right thing to do, but Homer is against it, believing that it isn't moral and a unborn child has a right for life. My personal view is that abortion should be legal because it is dangerous if it was illegal and just force it underground.I will said that this movie is not the greatest story and does sometimes go off the beaten track, but it makes up for it with its acting. Tobey Maguire is especially good, and Michael Caine won an Oscar, doing something he doesn't normally do, an American accent. Delroy Lindo was also good as Mr. Rose, the head worker and Charlize Theron was also decent.

I think that Charlize and Tobey would have made a nice couple in the movie, but I'm glad she went with the boyfriend she had when he really needed her. And it was nice that Homer (Tobey Maguire) get back. This is a movie that is worth seeing. I think it will be a classic for when our children are our ages that we are now.

It's the kind of story Charles Dickens would have loved and depressing at times.Maguire's taste of freedom (which results when he leaves the orphanage, has a brief affair with CHARLIZE THERON) and becomes mired in a sub-plot involving abortion and incest, is all dramatized with sensitivity that gives the whole story a very poignant flavor. The crisp color photography of New England during various seasons is also a plus factor.If you're looking for a warm-hearted tale of intense character relationships that moves at a rather leisurely pace (and has the feel of a Merchant-Ivory film at times), this is your ticket. MICHAEL CAINE truly deserved his Supporting Role Oscar.Highly recommended.

The rules are so outrageous that one really wonders why they were made in the first place. By beginning the story in Dr Larch's orphanage / abortion clinic, the writer wishes to suggest that the rules regarding abortion are equally outrageous. Candy, who lives at Cider House, comes to Dr Larch's clinic for an abortion, to get rid of the baby she has conceived through Wally before marriage. Homer, a grown-up orphan, and Dr Larch's protégé, leaves the clinic to go and live in the Cider House. He has never seen the world, and wants a taste of it. He thinks he will find something different there, and something less sordid. Unfortunately here he is confronted by people with passions and emotions who actually make a place like Dr Larch's clinic possible. It is because of sordid relationships in the outside world (like the one of Rose and her father's) that abortions become necessary. All the separate stories in the movie are subtly woven around the title 'The Cider House Rules'. They are the stories of Dr Larch's orphanage and clinic, the going's on at Cider House amongst the black workers, Candy and Wally's story and Homer's search for a different life. After his experience of helping Rose to get an abortion because of her conception of a child borne of incest, he realizes that he could do something meaningful if he went back to his surrogate father's clinic and performed abortions - which he previously religiously criticized. The title of the movie is very apt, and is the cement that holds all the stories together. There is nothing disjointed in the various plots - they all cohere in a powerful whole with the return of Homer to Dr Larch's clinic. Only now, since Dr Larch has died, he has to take over. And he does so with aplomb. Fantastically underplayed performances by Michael Caine (Dr Larch) and Tobey Maguire (Homer). "},{"Title":"Rules were made to be broken","Date":"6 September 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" Dr. Larch (Michael Caine) is the medical officer of the St. Cloud's orphanage in Maine. He disregards the law, makes his own rules and expects others to follow his precepts. He gathers orphaned children around him with a fatherly kindness referring to them as princes and kings and should a desperate woman wish to abort her baby he will oblige.To assist him in his tasks Dr. Larch selects an orphan Homer Wells (Toby Maguire)who has been twice returned to the orphanage and gives him a private education in medical subjects based on his own experience. Dr. Larch in his strange eccentric way believes that although the boy has not studied at a University he has gained all the necessary knowledge through him and is thus well-equipped for the job.There is a happy atmosphere about the orphanage because of the devoted staff. There are sad moments when couples arrive to adopt a child. There are cries of Take me! and I am the best! as children see a good future when adopted into a new family. When a child dies at the orphanage the staff try to keep it a secret and they tell the boys that he has been adopted out. Some tissues may be needed at times in the story.Dr. Larch is quite shaken when Homer decides to leave the orphanage and seek his fortune elsewhere. He does everything he can to stop him, but Homer is determined and ends up as a casual worker picking apples in a fruit orchard. The cider house where the pickers bunk up each night has rules but they argue they are not meant to be kept because the person who wrote them does not sleep there. Homer breaks a cardinal rule when he has an affair with the proprietor's wife. Another casual picker has sex with his daughter so predictably Homer steps in when the distraught daughter becomes pregnant.One of the loveliest scenes in the film is Homer's welcome back to the orphanage when Dr. Larch dies. An interesting scene prior to this is Dr. Larch's meeting with the Medical Board where he shrewdly uses a psychological approach to get Homer appointed.It's a very absorbing drama, predictable at times, but always interesting particularly when the ether-sniffing Dr. Larch is concerned. Toby Maguire renders a good performance as the simple orphan Homer who has never seen the sea nor a lobster and who Dr. Larch would firmly agree was a Prince of Maine.

He does a top-notch job as a young man raised in an orphanage and now trying to get a better understanding of the outside world. The whole movie really gives one the feeling of New England, with the crisp air and all. Also great in their roles are Charlize Theron as an acquaintance, Paul Rudd as her husband, and Michael Caine (who won Best Supporting Actor) as the man running the orphanage.What's really amazing is that the original author John Irving - who also wrote The World According to Garp - actually adapted the book to the screen, and even won an Oscar for it (the pro-abortion content drew protests from anti-abortion groups when he won). All in all, a great movie. Also starring Delroy Lindo, Jane Alexander, Kathy Baker, Erykah Badu, Kieran Culkin, Kate Nelligan, J.K.

The initial parts of the movie, where Micheal Caine -no doubt- proves to be a great actor, is in my opinion best parts of the movie. Some people may find those scenes melodramatic but I think they are actually what a drama should contain. The life and hopes of the children and the way that a idealist doctor behaves them is emotionally emphasized. However I find the second half a bit slow. I think there was no need to put an incest theme or repeat similar events concerning the life of workers. Such branching in scenario made the movie at least half an hour longer than it ought to be. However the parts that were related to Homer's decisions to discover life outside the local limited area he grew up, and similarly his last decision to find out where actually his soul belongs to where praise worthy.

I guess it was the relationship between Dr. Larch and Homer and the hopeless love story between Homer and Candy. To me, it was a story about growing up, realizing yourself and standing on  your own feet. I think Dr. Larch was a little pride about him, though he was worried as he left the  house - as if  Homer was his own son! But there also some things I don´t know what to think about - the  incest and abortion stories - I´m not sure if I got that right! But besides that I really LOVED it.  Not to forget Rachel Portmans wonderful epic score.  An warmhearted, human, unforgettable film.

He grew up in as an orphan and instead of being taken by outside parents, one of the main people who ran the place (Michael Caine) decided to take him on as a student doctor.  Once the young man gets older, he decides he wants to see the world, and just about that time is when I young couple who needs an abortion comes along and takes him with them.  He falls in love with the girl (Charlize Theron) after her boyfriend goes away to war.

(Note If you're vehemently against abortion, this doesn't apply to you!) On another level, it shows the very gray area in which much of life resides. Rather than definitively showing that one belief/action or another is best, I believe the movie does a good job of being indecisive. To me, this is commendable, because all of human existence really is subjective. For example, there is wide variation in opinion regarding whether a child conceived of incestuous rape should exist on our crowded planet. The movie is entertaining and philosophical without trying too hard, and allows you to take from it whatever you have the energy for.

Writer John Irving  recently defended his novel, saying that it took fourteen years for his screenplay translation (which won him an Oscar earlier this year) to reach the screen not because of the subject matter but because of the lack of a suitable director.Fortunately, the talented Swedish director Lasse Halström, who was directing such gems as 'ABBA The Movie' around the time Irving was writing the story, but later went onto 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape', took the helm. He has done an excellent, unobtrusive job, setting this touching story of a Forties orphanage-cum-abortion clinic among some beautifully photographed Maine countryside. Michael Caine, with an unusually subtle performance and a decent accent (both of which contributed to his recent Academy Award), plays Dr. Wilbur Larch, the liberal-minded head of St. Cloud orphanage. During the Thirties a young mother leaves a baby boy in his care, whom he names Homer Wells. Homer (promising young actor Tobey Maguire) is never taken away by prospective parents and so Dr. Larch trains him in the science of midwifery and, to his increasing moral objection, abortion. However, when a young couple (Paul Rudd and Charlize Theron) in need of Dr. Larch's services arrive, Homer decides to leave with them and make his way in the wide world.Homer takes a job picking apples with a group of migrant workers led by the enigmatic Mr. Rose (Delroy Lindo). From here the plot thickens in surprising ways, ultimately heart-warming, but often edgy enough to ask important questions about their superficially staid society. With a glut of believable and moving performances from the leads, the film really benefits from an excellent supporting cast, especially the migrant workers and the orphans. Emotional, powerful and beautifully shot, The Cider House Rules is just the thing for a quiet Sunday evening.

"},{"Title":"Thumbs-up to Caine, down to Maguire","Date":"9 April 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  John Irving's novel about the tribulations of Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire), a young man who lives all of his childhood in a relatively placid Maine orphanage, is in some ways a masterpiece of cinematic storytelling, although it's nearly sunk by the rather bland, Forrest Gumpishness of its lead character.   Homer Wells is given up by his natural parents as a baby, and for one reason or another is never adopted. Because of his long tenure at the orphanage, the home's good doctor (Michael Caine, who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his work here) teaches him how to be a doctor, and the two share many of the child-rearing duties at the orphanage. Assisted by Nurses Edna (Jane Alexander) and Angela (Kathy Baker), the duo perform countless deliveries of unwanted babies. There's a flip side to this issue, of course - the unwanted pregnancies that are aborted. Homer can't bring himself to perform the abortions, but Dr. Larch can. While the abortion issue isn't central to the plot of the movie, it is an integral piece to Homer's own coming-of-age. At some point, Homer must fly the coop and live life on his own, and here is where the comparisons to characters such as Forrest Gump or even Robin Williams' Garp come into play. Homer leaves the orphanage in due time, but he also leaves behind his family, including his fatherly superior, Dr. Larch, who loves the boy so much that he doesn't want him to go out into the world and be a failure when he knows Homer could stay at the orphanage and be useful.   This sweeping tale checks in at over 2 hours, but it's not a yawner by any stretch. Homer is forthright, honest, and above all respectful, all qualities sadly lacking in many people today. (Luckily, this film takes place in the first half of the 20th century, so those characteristics don't seem out of place.) Caine is amazing in his role, completely dropping his famous Cockney accent in favor of a stentorial New England dialect. Once you get past hearing him sound like an American, you'll be fine - but it's a little jarring at first. One could almost make an argument that Caine could have been up for Best Actor, but this is clearly a movie about Homer, not Dr. Larch.    As for Maguire.... Well, there's something to be said for subtle performances, to be sure, but there's also something to be said about underplaying a roll too much. Maguire simply is miscast. He's earnest, but there's not much expression to be read on his face. To put it succintly, he's more than underwhelming in the lead role. The antithesis of Maguire is the lovely and VERY talented Charlize Theron, a young woman who comes to the orphanage to have an abortion. Theron is stunning, but what really grabs you is her magnificent, moving, and endearing performance. This is an actress to keep your eyes on, ladies and gentlemen. She's going to be a very hot commodity soon, even hotter than she is now.

Do you agree that youngs know contraceptive methods to practise abort to get rid themselves of an undesired pregnancy ? And in case of pregnancy resultant of incest or rape ? Would you be in favor ? These questions are approached, not very much, in the movie The Cider House Rules, nominated to Oscar best picture in this year. The movie tells Homer Wells' (Tobey Maguire) saga, a young that lives in an orphanage in Maine, that leaves in search of definition his proper values in order to tread his proper destiny. Without parents, Homer lives in the orphanage under the guardianship of Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine), a gynecologist, vitiated to ether, that practices illegal aborts. The doctor educates Homer to be his successor, but the young, that was against the practical of abort and wanted to seek his place in the world by himself, decides to leave the orphanage to know the world with his proper eyes. He catches hitchhiking with the couple Wally (Paul Rudd) and Candy (Charlize Theron), that had been in Dr. Larch's clinic for an abort. Homer is going to work as picker of apples in Wally's mother farm. During his adventure, the young knows the love and also finishes needing to review his position about the abort. Although the thematic is very interesting - independence in the choice of the proper destiny -, besides involving controversies questions (another subject that appears in tram is the incest), The Cider House Rules is a lukewarm movie. You leave the movies thinking that could have seen a much better movie, more disturbing movie. Despite the good argument, the movie does not have great dialogues or discussions, losing an excellent chance of constructing intense debates. When approaching the abort, the director Lasse Hallström stands in top of the wall, not arriving at the x of the question. It is not evident, for example, in the end of the movie, if Homer Wells changed your position about the subject. Apparently, he became favorable, but everything is very implicit. Thus, The Cider House Rules is very far his competitors in the dispute for the Oscar. It is not afflictive, distressing as The Green Mile, nor disturbing as The Sixth Sense, much less, so bold, forceful and direct as American Beauty. It is only little pretty.

Talented actors are working here, but they have nothing to work with.There's a relentless message here that abortion is an ok thing if we expect people to be responsible parents they should become parents as a result of responsible decisions.  This point is hammered home relentlessly.  What was it Samuel Goldwyn said about messages being for Western Union?Speaking of hammered relentlessly, the musical score by Rachel Portman is true Hall of Shame material.  Every time there's an important plot point the music swells madly because the film's makers figure we're too stupid to understand what's going on.  Maybe it was just a bad mix in the theatre where we saw it, but the music darned near drowned out the dialogue.  Of course, that might have been a blessing in disguise.It's a shame.  Lots of people worked very hard on this movie.  There were actors here who have done fine work elsewhere.  The production design and camera work are absolutely top notch.

All of these changes and more are to great effect and it is very much a lesson in the different needs and strengths of a novel and a film.  The cast is superb, all of them, the direction is assured and warm and the scenery is lovely.  Cider House Rules is well crafted from all angles and it manages to be highly compelling while at the same time it has a heart.  Indeed, this story was even more successful a rendering of the source material than the strong film 'Simon Birch' was of the novel Owen Meany' and clearly John Irving now rules on the screen and on the written page.

It stood out as an excellent example of filmmaking, editing, and cinematography.  However, in acting it is only moderately good.  Often, I consider good acting to be the ability to make me, as a viewer, forget that these _are_ actors, and that they actually are the people they're portraying.  That kind of experience is, unfortunately, rare.  *shrug* And was I the only one who thought that Tobey Macguire looks far, FAR too young to be bedding Charlize Theron?Again, a good film, but not the one I'll be rooting for come the Academy Awards.Rating 7/10.

Irving is my favorite author, and I was afraid to see what he had done with his own book to turn it into a film.It really works well. Somewhat mushy, the film captures much of the sense of awe and wonder that the book has and tweaks them a bit, so it's a bit more sentimental. Michael Caine is of course beyond any criticism - but I'd like to give Tobey Maguire a hand for his acting he manages to BE Homer Wells as I remember him from the book. Very well done.Also, there are some beautiful footage in this film. What I don't like is how easy they dismiss the fact that Mr Rose sleeps with his own daughter.Other than that, it's worth s few Oscars.

I wanted more time to mull over TCHR and let it soak in. I'd like to see it again to catch some of the nuances. TCHR succeeds at putting you in another place and time. In this case, rural Maine during World War II. It also puts you inside the head of its main character -- orphan and unlicensed doctor Homer Wells -- seeing things through his eyes. The story itself is full of the unanswerable questions of everyday life -- mainly who do you love and what do you do about it? As in Ride With the Devil, Tobey McGuire plays a naive young male lead forced to confront a series of tough questions about himself and his world when every answer will break somebody's heart. Highly recommended ... a possible classic.

Michael Caine is great in his customary fashion -- he breathes life into his role with honesty, humour, and the ease which surrounds the performances of many true artists.

With so much going for it - an outstanding cast (Michael Caine, Tobey Maguire, Kathy Baker, Jane Alexander,  Charlize Theron, Delroy Lindo, Kate Nelligan), a brilliant director (Lasse Hallstrom), wonderful cinematography, the proper mood and music, and good (albeit liberal) intentions, what happened to Cider House Rules?  Simply, John Irving's novel is so full of inconsistencies  that even the translation to film doesn't make it any better.  We are to believe that an orphan, Homer Wells, known to all in the community, is to come back as a doctor without anyone's notice; that somehow a doctor's bag can contain all the where-with-all to do an abortion; that Homer and Candy (whose celebrated boyfriend is off fighting WWII) can carry on a love affair in a small town without retribution; that a father can knowingly engage in incest but not know about pregnancy; and that a young man so committed to life can still act out situational ethics.  The film also portrays do-gooders to excess.  A kindly doctor who reads nightly to his orphan boys and tells them they are 'princes of Maine and kings of New England', a sweet orphanage with sweet nurses that has no lack of decent children, an apple orchard owner who seems to treat all her workers well (save for bad plumbing).   The first part of Cider House Rules really captured my heart - the quaint doctor, the unwanted children, the good intentions.  When we moved into a remake of Summer of 42, the whole thing fell apart.  Rule 1 of good filmmaking is if you spend money and time assembling a well-acted cast and crew, you better have a story worthy of them.  Cider House Rules is a sad work by John Irving, novelist and rule-breaker.

Homer is taken care of by the nurses and is the protege of Dr. Wilbur Larch, played by the great Michael Caine who delivers an amazing right on target performance, an illegal abortion giving, baby delivering, ether addicted doctor who has hopes of Homer taking over for him.However Homer wants to see a bit of what's out there but he doesn't go very far simply traveling across Maine. There he works in a cider house and out picking apples in the orchard.  There he falls in love with Candy Kendall (Charlize Theron), a girl who has trouble being alone.  Though Homer realizes that he can't have Candy, because her husband just returned from the war, and they can never be together. He accepts this and decides to return to the orphanage, the place that holds his heart and passion.While a compelling drama Cider is also a great character study going in depth on Homers struggles with accepting himself and his love of the orphanage and more importantly the children that stay there. So, How far do we have to travel to find where we really belong? For Homer, to a small cider house and apple orchard across the state of Maine.Beautifully photographed, compassionately directed by Hallstrom, and featuring great supporting roles filled by Kieran Culkin, Delroy Lindo, Paul Rudd, and Erykah Badu among others, The Cider House Rules is easily one of the best films of the year and certainly delivers compassion and inspiration to its viewers.Good night you Princes of Maine, you Kings of New England.

The reason why is, when I saw a preview on TV, I said to myself well it doesn't look too bad, just a love story between Charlize Theron and Tobey Maguire...I was wrong.  And while it did involve a love story between the two, it was a very different movie; definitely one of the best dramas of the season.The story begins at an orphanage where Dr. Wilbur Larch (played excellently by Michael Caine in his first role with an American accent) delivers a small baby boy, like hundreds of times before, and puts him up for adoption with all the other boys and girls.  But this boy, named Homer, has a few problems with parents who try to adopt him.  Actually, the parents seem to have problems with him; the first set of parents were upset that he didn't cry (Dr. Larch says orphan babies never cry, they see no point in it), and the second set of parents beat him, so he cried too much.Eventually Homer grew up in the orphanage, closer to Dr. Larch than all the other children, and eventually learns all the tricks in the trade to perform abortions and deliver orphan babies.  Homer is getting restless though, he knows that at his age (late adolesence) there is alot more to see in the world.  So he leaves one day, and hitches a ride to see the world with a young couple (Paul Rudd and Charlize Theron, both surprisingly very good).Tobey Maguire is certainly becoming a very talented actor, and although some would say is performance in Cider was easliy acted (he was a very mellow character), it definitley convinced me enough.  Michael Caine was great, as usual, and the accent was pretty solid too.  I could praise the whole cast individually, but let's just say they were on par with the cast of The Green Mile.If you want to see a very beautifully filmed and emotionally involved drama this Oscar season, I urge one and all to see The Cider House Rules.

Then there are films that you see because you know that they will not be around at the theatre for very long.  Last year I saw a fine film called Something More that was a sweet film about the perils of dating in the 30 something age group.  It had a cast of relative unknowns but it looked, for lack of a better word, nice.  It was quite the film and after I saw it, it abruptly left the theater about a week later.  Cider House Rules may last longer than Something More, but not much.  It too is a sweet film that doesn't boast of a huge cast.  Let's face it, Tobey Maguire and Clarize Theron are not on the A-list of actors that can open a film.  Maguire is probably best known for his stint in Pleasantville and Theron is gorgeous and probably known maybe for her role in Mighty Joe Young.  Not huge hits by any stretch but together in this film they are wonderful.  Michael Caine is always terrific in almost every film he chooses ( we'll forgive him for Jaws 4 ) and here he even pulls off a Maine accent quite well.  But CHR is not the type of film that is going to make 100 million at the box office and bring in droves of people.  But what it is, is a great character study of one character named Homer Wells and it is also a story about finding out who you are, even if that means making mistakes.  After all, how are you supposed to learn if not by trial and error?  It is also a film that tells us that sometimes what we think we know isn't always the truth.  As one of the characters in Secret of My Success said,  There are no right and wrongs, only opinions. The richness of the film stems from the screenplay, which was written by Irving himself, and the actors that portray his characters.  As I said, Tobey Maguire is a great young actor and you can see his ability shine through here.  He is not over the top in any of scenes and sometimes it may seem as though he is very comatose in certain scenes, but then you watch a bit more and realize that he is his character.  Homer Wells is exactly the way Maguire plays him.  He is always thinking, always wondering and always perhaps a step ahead of the other people in his life and Maguire's perfect interpretation of him is one of the best performances of the year.  I would love to see him get a nomination this year for best actor, but that is a tough field already.  Clarize Theron shows great range as well and Erika Badyhu is quite good as Rose Rose, the daughter of Mr. Rose.  He is played by Delroy Lindo.  You may remember him from Ransom with Mel Gibson.  In this film he is perfect.  This is a man many layers to him.  At first you love him then you don't like him so much.  But that would be too easy.  I think the screenplay paints this man with many shades of gray.  And we are left to decide at the end of the film how we feel about him.  What I enjoyed most about the film was showing how people are people and that we all make mistakes.  The seduction of flesh and power of love are hard to ignore, no matter how loyal you may feel to one person.  It's funny, in some ways I can draw parallels to this film and Magnolia.  Both try to tell us that human beings are fragile and mistake prone.  We all sin and perhaps we all have to pay for those sins somehow.  But the difference between this film and the obnoxious, smash mouth Magnolia is that this says it in a way that doesn't annoy us or make us want to rip the projector out and set it a blaze.  Magnolia made me angry, Cider House Rules touched me and made me happy.  It made me think a great deal as I left the theater.  It also showed me that it is okay to make mistakes.  We all do, it's what you do to rectify the situation that counts.  Cider House Rules won't be in the theaters for very long but it is one film that should be seen.  You'll be glad that you did.

The reason, of course, is that Irving himself wrote the screenplay and finally the quirky characters from his books are portrayed with some depth instead of as a bunch of loonies.Tobey Macguire as the main character Homer Wells turned in another wonderful performance, better even than he did as the spooky neighbor kid in American Beauty. Michael Caine, who I am generally annoyed with due to his over the top performances, was at his best in his relatively subdued role as Dr. Wilbur Larch. The rest of the cast was good as well.The story takes place in the 1940's in St. Clouds, Maine at an orphanage run by the ether sniffing Dr. Larch (Caine). Larch, in his own words, tries to give women what they want. If that means a delivered baby to be left in his care at the orphanage or an illegal abortion, he is willing to do it without judgement. He treats all of the children at the orphanage like his own but he pays special attention to the twice adopted, twice rejected Homer whom he trains to become a doctor. Homer is the oldest child at the orphanage and assists Dr Larch in both deliveries and abortions. He becomes morally opposed to the abortions and refuses to continue helping in the procedure in spite of Larch's repeated attempts to show him the necessity of the procedure.When a young couple, Walter and Candy (Theron and Rudd), come for an abortion he decides to pack his bags and leave with them, much to the sadness of the residents of the orphanage. He heads to the coast with Walter and Candy and gets a job at Walter's family orchard. There he lives with a group of migrant workers headed by Mr. Rose and his daughter Rose Rose. On the wall of the Cider House is a set of ridiculous rules and since Homer is the only one who can read they ask him to read them. Later in the story, after a major plot point, Homer finally does and Mr. Rose responds by saying basically, Those aren't our rules, we work here and we live here...we make our own rules.Homer, falls in love with Candy after Walter leaves for the war and enjoys his life of apple picking and lobstering. He refuses to return to St. Clouds in spite of Larch's repeated pleadings and schemings but later in the story is confronted with the reality that his own set of rules or mores are not exactly set in stone and need to be re-vised somewhat. I won't give away any more than that. There aren't any real surprise endings but the whole thing comes to a very satisfying conclusion.A lot of people will find the message of this movie very disturbing and probably dislike it for that reason. I've read every one of Irving's novels and I find myself generally on the opposite side of every moral and political issue that Irving puts forth. At the same time I am captivated by every story. Since I am pro-life, I found Cider House Rules one of the most disturbing books I have ever read and also one of my favorites. The movie affected me the same way. I can really identify with Homer and although my set of rules have not had to be as dramatically altered as his, they have been adapted and modified along the way. You have to see this movie with an open mind to appreciate it.A very good movie and so nice to see a book that Hollywood didn't ruin! "}{"Title":"Princes of Maine!

Cider House Rules is a story typical of the great writer, set in a New England town (this time in Maine) with a cast of odd characters facing some tough taboos.  Lasse Halstrom's film version is true to the book in that it brings to life the heart of the story.  Michael Caine is Dr. Wilbur Larch, custodian of an orphanage.  A kind and gentle man, he takes in unwanted children and offers safe abortions without question.  Toby McGuire plays Homer, one of those orphans who was adopted out unsuccessfully on two different occasions.  His unlucky circumstances make him a favorite to Dr. Larch and soon he becomes his unwilling protege.  The story takes off when Homer decides he would like to see the rest of the world thus leaving the orphanage.  Of course, this is to the dismay of Dr. Larch.Cider House Rules is one of the more sentimental films to come out of the last year.  And unlike previous Irving adaptations, this one is not so outrageous, but rather more tender and compassionate. Michael Caine is wonderful as the doctor.  In yet another great performance, he does not let down his guard.  He remains, throughout the film, the stoic, caring, kind, gentle doctor that people come to when desperate.  His one downfall is his addiction to ether, however, this is in keeping with a man who must carry the weight of others without judgement.The entire cast comes off well.  There were some great supporting performances from the likes of Kate Nelligan, Erykah Badu and Delroy Lindo.  Of course Toby McGuire plays the great voice of reason, as he did in previous efforts like The Ice Storm and Pleasantville. Cider House Rules is not without its danger zones.  Be warned that there is very blatant talk of abortion and incest throughout this film.  While I appreciated the message, others may not.  What turned out to be the greatest treat was that this was the first film in a long time that featured an orphanage doing exactly what they were intended to do.  This orphanage is not filled with abuse and pain, but rather it is a safe haven from the abuse and pain that goes on outside its doors. Cider House Rules is a must see!

In one scene Tobey shotguns a beer (Nady Light no less) and the black people yell This Cider House RULES! and that's kind of how the film gets it's name. One time they catch Tobey gazing at Charlize's tits and they simultaneously yell The Cider House RULES! and Tobey laughs. He knows.The scene that really drives home the movie's message of fractured communication in an increasingly misogynic society is when Tobey is initiated into the Cider House. Stripped of his clothing, he has to stick a greased 45 record between his a$$ cheeks and carry it across the room and place it on the phonograph without using his hands (Louis Armstrong record of course). All of this while the other residents chant Cider House Rule, Cider House Rule over and over in a tribal fashion. Charlize is there and she's INTO it.

This is the kind of movie that shows up every couple of years and truly captures the heart of those who appreciate drama, and completely blows a person who loves storytelling out of this world. This film is one of those films that takes a separate road than most, rather than telling the story of one who ventures away from home to discover what his life is missing, the protagonist Homer Wells, played by Tobey Maguire, actually leaves home only to discover that what his destiny holds has been there all along, and that the real world was what he needed to go and see in order to make the most important realization of his life. Yes, he finds happiness in what he does away from home (picking apples from a Cider House), and yes he does find love, in a sense. But, like many things that come to us in life, Homer also experiences the loss of many he comes to care for and even the heart of the one he loves. I am one of those people who believes that Hollywood is truly at it's best when movies like this are made. Forget those blockbuster thrillers and suspenseful, gut-wrenching experiences that have our heart pumping faster. Appreciate stories like the Cider House Rules, that instead have us walking out trying to catch our breaths as our hearts feel as if they've stopped.

Homer is born and given up to an orphanage in rural Maine. He is guided and mentored by a very creative Doctor Larch, played by Micheal Caine. Doctor Larch and Homer create a bond between the two of them that leads Homer into manhood. Homer finds indifferences in his life as a practicing physician, as he is taught to perform abortions.While performing an abortion Homer finds his chemical identity, Candy Kendall, played by Charlize Theron. This beautiful woman finds a place for Homer in her heart when her boyfriend Lieutenant Wally Worthington, played by Paul Rudd, is sent off to war in Europe. Homer finds his way into a new profession as he chases after his new beauty through the apple orchards of New England. While Homer takes a new road into his new life, he is faced with trials and tribulations from his past. The director, Lasse Halstrom, has created a wonderful film masterpiece that has won two Oscars. She does a fabulous job correlating this movie to the book and the talent selected for this movie was very desirable. As the seasons changed in New England, Halstrom was right with them as she chose low key lighting for the right situations. The camera angles and sound for this film were in line with the action. A perfect example of her first-class directing was during the confrontation between Homer and Mr. Rose, played by Delroy Lindo. The lighting, camera angle, and sound were all in direction to portray this significant turning point for Homer and Mr. Rose.Cider House Rules portrays that life does not play by specific rules. Life is a journey with many roads, many of which have been paved by others. In this film, Homer decided to make his own trail which was the path where he had never gone before. Sometimes, the road less traveled is often the only way we get to stop and smell the apples. This film is highly recommended for all, and especially for those who have forgotten which road to take in their life.

As the years progress, the young man grows weary of being a part of a profession second-hand and travels to a neighboring town to work in an apple orchard. Coming-of-age story with an episodic dramatic structure starts to work after most of the orphanage-preliminaries are blessedly out of the way (Irving and director Lasse Hallström, two jaded souls, go surprisingly heavy on the sick-child and snowball-fight scenes), and the casting is terrific. Michael Caine, who won a Supporting Oscar, isn't a wily eccentric or a fanciful dreamer; he's playing a deeply troubled man with conflicting views of the world, rebellious against the law but also a realist with flagging energy. As his protégé, Tobey Maguire overcomes the obviousness of his role and handles the latter portions (where he's front and center) exceptionally well. Maguire is given some difficult scenes to play, and he carries them off without being showy (his solemn face and calming manner are mature and yet boyish, but never gregarious). As a dimpled, honey-dewed soldier's sweetheart, Charlize Theron has an even more cookie-cutter role to fill, but she does just what is needed and looks beautiful to boot. There are some bummer scenes such as Maguire's speech on the docks about the futility of making decisions and an incest/murder plot-thread that takes up time on the clock. Worse, there's a bit of impatience in waiting for this circular story to do its thing (with the passing of the torch and so on); yet, the film is carefully mounted for a moving pay-off, and only true curmudgeons would fail to be stirred emotionally by that finale. **1/2 from **** "}{"Title":"Home in the Cider House Rules and Homer's Odyssey","Date":"30 January 2007","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" I found The Cider House Rules to be a film I have watched over and over I am never ceased to be amazed at Homer Well's Odyssey and how he finds himself as a true medical healer in the dark world of the colored people and incest in the Cider House \Candy Kendall is (I think) a conflation of the two minor goddesses in Homer's Odyssey Circe and Kalypso - she ensnares Homer Wells though her seeming vulnerability whereas in fact she is taller and generally bigger than Homer WellsIn the book Homer Wells migrates back and forth between Cape Kenneth and St Clouds' but the film is far more dramatic in content that Homer only makes his journey there and back once It is a truly tragic and dramatic moment when Homer and Candy are sitting in the rain - Candy mourning for a paralysed Wally and Homer agonising over a pregnant Rose Rose and the knowledge he can help her and finally must do the think he hates most - abortion Does Dr Larch kill himself as Mr Rose certainly killed himself?

Tobey Maguire stars as Homer, a young man who grew up his whole life in an orphanage under the care of Dr. Wilbur Larch (the fabulous Michael Caine). When a WWII veteran (Paul Rudd) and his beautiful wife (Charlize Theron) come into the orphanage to get an abortion performed by Larch and Homer, Homer decides to leave the orphanage for the first time to go out and see the world. Homer leaves with Theron and Rudd where he works on Rudd's parent's farm picking apples under the supervision of Mr. Rose (Delroy Lindo) and his team of apple pickers including his bright and interesting daughter Rose (Erekah Badu). The film shows how Homer learns what the world and people are like outside the orphanage and how he deals with it. Tobey Maguire gives a wonderful performance as the lead role, while Charlize Theron is solid in her role (before her turn in Patty Jenkin's 'Monster', when we all discovered what a truly magnificent actress she really was). Delroy Lindo gets a chance to exercise his dramatic abilities as Mr. Rose, and he does a fantastic job with it. Michael Caine is only in the film for perhaps a combination of 25 minutes, but in those minutes he steals the film from every other actor on screen with his breathtaking and beautifully-crafted performance that won him the Best Supporting Actor Oscar that very year. Lasse Hallstrom does a nice job directing and the film is smoothly adapted onto the screen from it's original theatrical play format. The movie also stars Kathy Baker and Jane Alexander as nurses working under Caine's Dr. Wilbur Larch.

But reading through the many comments on this site, it seems to me that a whole lot of people viewing the film were sidetracked by the abortion issue, and missed the real heart of the story. But, just to get it out of the way, let's do this thing.  I really don't understand why pro-life people get so up in arms about this movie.  I understand finding abortion horrible, sinful, or evil.  That makes sense to me.  But very few people really look at this film on its own terms.  Everyone is reading into it a grand liberal scheme to propagandize abortion, and to make it seem like a good thing.  I don't know, maybe there is such a scheme, but so what?  The film can be interpreted in any number of ways, many of them without a pro-choice slant. Many people see the film in terms of an ongoing argument between Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine) and Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire), which, in the end, Dr. Larch wins.  In other words, Homer is eventually persuaded of the rightness of Dr. Larch's views and actions.  This may indeed be what the author attempted to say (I've never read the book, which would perhaps shed some more light on it), but I really don't think it's as simple as that. First of all, Homer is never, at any point in the film, your typical pro-life kind of guy.  He explicitly says, very early on, that he has no objection whatsoever to Dr. Larch performing abortions.  He clearly has moral qualms about the practice, but he only objects to being asked to perform them himself.  In modern political terms, he would have to be considered pro-choice.  So this film does not represent the victory of pro-choice over pro-life.  It represents the victory of pragmatism over idealism.  Homer has a very idealistic vision of his role in life.  He wants to be of use, but he feels that performing abortions should not be necessary to that function.  Dr. Larch argues that performing abortions is very necessary, because the alternative is far worse for all involved.  Dr. Larch does not advocate abortions to pregnant women.  He does not delight in terminating pregnancies.  He terminates pregnancies in a manner which is safe to the mother when the alternative is that the mother will find other, more dangerous means to reach the same end.  Sure, the world would be better if no one ever needed or wanted an abortion, but they do, and given that fact, we have to adjust.  You can't ever eliminate the practice of abortion, so shouldn't those abortions that do occur be performed by competent professionals? This is the lesson that Homer learns.  Incidentally, the specific case which compels Homer to relax his personal moral opposition to abortion is exactly a case to which most pro-lifers admit an exception; the case of incest.  So, I really can't comprehend the vitriol with which pro-lifers often attack this film.  But anyway, forget about that.  This movie is a coming of age story featuring terrific characters, excellent performances, and a strong story.  There's so much more to this film than abortion.  The character of Mr. Rose (Delroy Lindo) is one of the most fascinating characters I've ever seen.  He is a hideous monster, capable of unimaginable cruelty.  But he is also a kind man.  This sort of moral contradiction happens so frequently in life, yet so rarely in films.  For that character alone, and for the performance of Mr. Lindo, this film deserves high praise.  Basically, I think the film is about a journey of discovery, as trite as that sounds.  Homer lives for years in a very stable, organized, structured, and protected environment.  He is nurtured, cared for, and sheltered.  Once he leaves the orphanage, he enters a world that is far more complex than what he's used to, and that complexity makes a mockery of all of his noble, altruistic aims.  There's no helping anyone... not out there, Dr. Larch says.  He's not exactly right, but he's right enough.  Homer's simple good nature is unequipped to deal with the moral ambiguities and contradictions of real life.  Candy says she loves him, and maybe she does, yet she hurts him mercilessly.  Candy loves her husband, but betrays him.  Homer, in his simplicity, is swept up into this moral quagmire when he betrays his friend, Candy's husband.  His eventual return to the orphanage could be seen as a retreat from the realities of life, but he isn't trying to protect himself from the harsh world.  He's going back to the only controlled environment he's ever known, an environment within which he is able to be far more effective in his ceaseless desire to be of use.  This film has such a simple, graceful arc, and some really lovely cinematography.  It has, as I said, strong compelling characters well acted.  It has a terrific script full of insight, wonder, sadness, and love.  It has Charlize Theron's bare buttocks. Sorry, I lost my composure for a moment. If people didn't get so caught up in the abortion thing, I think this film would be much more popular than it is.

Although Wilbur develops a strong paternal bond with all of the children, The Cider House Rules examines his special dedication toward Homer Wells, a baby boy who, after proving to be un-adoptable, remains under his tutelage. Throughout the years, Homer (Tobey Maguire) learns about the philosophy behind Wilbur's profession, while resisting the idea of adopting the same. The plot evolves as Homer leaves Wilbur and the orphanage, finds employment in a cider-producing plant, and a new home in the Cider House. Here Candy Kendall (Charlize Theron), fiancée of the Cider House owner's son, and a pregnant Rose Rose (Erykah Badu) force Homer to revisit the philosophies of the distant Dr. Larch.Aside from the good humor and the delicate sympathy with which The Cider House Rules portrays its characters and their situations, the film delivers reasonable pro-choice arguments, which state that 1) in order to allow the opportunity of being a good parent, the choice of being parents to begin with should be allowed as well; and 2) If those who are qualified don't perform the abortion, others will. Most importantly, The Cider House Rules is successful in supporting these arguments by approaching --subtly, yet sensibly-- the dilemmas which envelope the issues. In this same careful manner, The Cider House Rules interweaves meaningful relationships among its characters and adds optimism to all resolutions.

If you need a movie that will make you forget about your own sorrows, go see The Cider House Rules because it will only make you realise that you have nothing to worry about.

A movie that revolves around-- --abortion as a way of life --world war --incest --a knife fight --two suicides is not fooling around with anybody's sentiments.  The beautiful people (the orphans, the black people) and the beautiful landscape are being played off against the general nastiness.  This is just one of the movie's steady stream of ironies.The Cider House Rules is a black comedy, whose central irony is the monarchical orphanage v. the democratic cider house (rules supposedly imposed on the cider house from above have not even been read).  The orphanage is ruled by a caretaker, a benevolent king, whose primary goal in the movie is to settle the succession.  But Prince Homer abdicates, moving from an orphanage of underprivileged children to a cider house of underprivileged adults.  There the prince finds out what his true business is--he too is a caretaker.  The central scene in the movie is when Homer confronts the father in the cider house with his incest.  As a caretaker, Homer can't do anything else. When he realizes that his business is the medical business, and that he is a caretaker, Homer assumes his spiritual father's mantle.The Cider House Rules is a wonderfully achieved black comedy, and it does not have a sentimental bone in its body.

Cider's subjects of drug addiction, incest, infidelity, and (most of all) abortion might leave a more inquisitive viewer to wonder whether they just watched The Waltons meet Oliver Twist or a repackaged American Beauty.Watching this film is like eating a sweet, homemade pie with swamp-scum filling.  Don't get me wrong.  I fully believe the movie to be worth the price of admission.  It was entertaining and the performances of promising newcomer Maguire and reliable veteran Caine deserve the accolades they have received.  Yet, I can't get over how the filmmakers have so beautifully and touchingly presented such tawdry subject matter.I spent the first 20 years of my life apathetic on the issue of abortion (which is to say I was pro-choice).  I have since come full-circle on the issue and now proudly declare myself to be pro-life.  This change of position was not so much caused by religiosity than it was by a frank observation of some disturbing trends in society.  I firmly believe that we do not value human life as much as we used to and I can think of no other issue that has contributed to this more than legalized abortion (except, perhaps, capital punishment and euthanasia).I do not mind a fair debate on the issue - it is so complex as to warrant some serious, honest, and fair debate.  Cider does not present the issue fairly, though.  Homer Wells' change of heart on the merits of abortion was motivated by two relatively rare events.  First, a young patient nearly killed herself in an attempt to self-terminate a pregnancy with a foreign object.  Second, Rose Rose was traumatically raped and impregnated by her father.  Homer decided, after this second circumstance, that abortion had merits and the right thing to do was kill the baby.While I'm sure that many occurrences of situations similar to these took place in the pre-Roe v. Wade days as well as today, Cider attempts to legitimize all abortion-on-demand by these relatively rare sets of circumstances.  I think objective viewers deserve a more realistic presentation of the facts surrounding the abortion debate - if, in fact, the cinema is a proper place to offer any argument at all (seeing as how the opposing viewpoint has no opportunity to rebut).In all, Cider is great filmmaking if for no other reason than its ability to distract less discerning viewers from its real contents.  The costumes, sets, acting, writing, and direction are all worth kudos.  It was as sweet a pie as I've tasted (although I had to hold my nose prevent the swampish odor).

I will not do that, but the result will be just the same. I mean,when you make it through the opening scenes(which are rather confusing)and you know what's going on, you can also easily predict the rest of the film. IT'S THAT OBVIOUS! First of all, the story isn't very interesting. A boy that was raised inside a hospital gets  a chance to know the world.(and see the sea...haven't we heard this before?BEING THERE,even the TRUMAN SHOW,...) Meanwhile some questions are raised about abortion, drugs and incest. But this was obviously too much to take for the director. So he put them aside and got on with the film. Nothing really seems interesting enough to explore and actually...nothing in this movie IS interesting enough to do that! Plus, the story is filled with clichés and is so incredibly corny that this doesn't even work as just an entertaining movie to sit through. The symbolism(especially towards the end) is also very obvious. It's actually so obvious that they were probably thinking no one would get it if they didn't show it this way.  Then the actors. I thought Tobey Maguire was pretty monotonous in this movie. Did they want him to act like some sort of good-natured idiot, a bit like Homer(indeed,the same name!) from THE SIMPSONS? Well,it's hard to compare these two (apart from the name)characters.But the major difference is that Homer Simpson is a funny, interesting character who seems to be more real-life than the dull,unappealing Homer Wells character in this film.Michael Caine however gave a fine performance(enough for an oscar nomination?), as did Delroy Lindo. And Charlize Theron? I think she wasn't bad, but wasn't very good either. In fact, I don't think she will ever be a great actress. Only good for small parts in films such as this one or THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE(in which she fit in very well,certainly much better than in this film).All in all, a film that isn't extremely bad. That's why I still give it 5/10. There are certainly films that are far worse than this one. But this film is too ambitious and predictable and also succeeds in being boring. A film that can easily be forgotten. And let's face it does this really stand a chance against AMERICAN BEAUTY or THE GREEN MILE on oscar night? I honestly don't think so. As I said 5/10.

It wouldn't be so bad if it was actually saying anything important, but it's not at all.The film is the most basic coming-of-age story of a young man experiencing life for the rest time and it doesn't strive to do...anything, really. It's further proof that Tobey Maguire has no charisma at all and can't lead a film if his life depended on it. Honestly, I'm having trouble thinking of someone with less screen presence in his age group and I am so glad that that late '90s surge of people constantly trying to make him the next big thing died out as quick as it did. Michael Caine and Delroy Lindo do fine supporting work, but Caine disappears after the first act and Lindo's character goes down a narrative path that is probably the worst thing about the film -- it's so absurd and out of absolutely nowhere, I'm honestly still trying to wrap my head around what that was even doing here.The whole thing sets up so many strands for the plot but doesn't center itself well enough and when it tries to tie all of those strands together it comes apart completely. It's so miserably paced, the final act drags on for eternity. It felt like it's probably a decent novel but in adapting it to the screen they tried to condense it so much and as a result it falls flat and entirely worthless. Along with all of that it's got one of those classic Rachel Portman I'm going to make you cry if I have to blast this music straight down your throat scores that makes me sick.

The story of Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine), the head physician of an orphanage in Maine who takes an unwanted orphan named Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire) under his wing. As Homer grows older, he begins to question what life is like outside of the orphanage. Although he is training to become a doctor under the watchful eye of Larch, Homer decides to leave the orphanage with Candy (Charlize Theron) and Wally (Paul Rudd), a young couple looking to secretly have an abortion. Homer discovers love, friendship, and the all too familiar heartbreak in life outside of the orphanage where he has spent his entire life.Larch's big plans for Homer to take over for him at the orphanage are derailed as Homer begins the hard labor of apple picking, where he encounters the cider house rules, a set of guidelines for the migrant workers to abide by as they are a guest in the shelter provided for them. Homer along with the other workers start to realize that they are able to set their own rules for life as they seem to break every rule without consequence. One of my favorite scenes is when the migrant workers find out Homer is a trained Doctor, needing him to perform an abortion. Anyone who has seen the film knows Homer's moral dilemma when it comes to abortion (on numerous occasions he displays his thanks to the mother he never knew for having him), but in the end he breaks his own rules.I have so much respect for the author and screenwriter for the film, Academy Award winning John Irving. I was able to read his novel, My Movie Business, which goes into detail about his hard journey in getting this to the big screen. Irving's number one goal with this story is to show the relationship between Dr. Larch and Homer, a pair that begins to drift away from one another as Homer grows older. Larch plays the role of the clingy father figure who does not want to lose his only son. The story works to the level that boys will become men, no matter how hard it is as a parent to accept it. In the end, the Cider House Rules shows there is no escaping destiny, no matter how bad you want to.

If I had written the book, I would have wanted a tighter storyline.But in all honesty, even if it were a better film, I still would not have liked its premise, themes, or ideas.  It seems to be based on the thought that rules are made to be broken.  There are several instances of laws, rules, and social norms that are broken repeatedly without showing any of the consequences of those actions.  Nobody ends up in jail for breaking the law, no employees are punished for breaking company rules, and nobody is shown with hurt feelings when a trust is violated.  The characters even react to the deaths of other characters with little sadness, if any.

Indeed, what would you think of a book adaptation for the screen if it - skims the surface of the plot barely touching the real story; - crams the first half of the book into the first 10 minutes of movie time (with the cast and credits popping up at appropriate intervals), throws half of the characters out of the story (including the most interestingly controversial one &#150; Melony), dwells for one and a half hours on an uninspired love-story line and just omits the last third of the book; - compacts 20 (well written!) years of the main character's life into an incomprehensible gooey mass of disconnected events, unmotivated actions and lackluster emotions and never allows the protagonist grow beyond confused boyhood (the original book ends when he is forty!).

He raises orphan Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire) as his medical apprentice after he was twice rejected by adoptive parents.Under Larch's supervision he is in essence an unqualified doctor. Wells also reluctantly performs abortions. Larch carries out the abortions because the alternative for the women is much worse with dangerous backstreet abortions.In 1943, Wally Worthington (Paul Rudd) and girlfriend Candy Kendall (Charlize Theron) come for an abortion, Wally is a soldier. Homer is unable to serve in the war because of his weak heart decided he wants to experience the world and leaves with them even though he is popular at the orphanage and Dr Larch treats him like a son.Homer works at the Worthington's apple farm staying in their Cider House with the seasonal workers who are mainly black and illiterate. The workers never realised the rules posted in the Cider House as no one told them about it or explained it to them. They certainly could not read it.Wally goes off to war and soon Candy and Homer begin a passionate affair. Back at the orphanage the staff hope he will return soon he regularly writes letters to them. Dr Larch sets up fake qualifications in order to pave way for Homer's return as the new doctor in the orphanage one day.The film has a central theme about rules and how they are set and made to follow by those who do not realise that if the people who the rules are for can read them, understand them or know what purpose they are for. This applies to the Cider House rules which is presumably for the worker's safety and the rules against abortion which is more biblical.Surrounding these issues we have the unwanted kids at the orphanage and the love given to them by Dr Larch and his staff who try to shield them away in this remote part of Maine from the big bad world as best they could. It helps that the kids are sweet, some get adopted, some stay until they grow old enough. A few die because their health is not strong enough.The film goes to and fro from the orphanage to Homer as he enjoys his life at the orchard and his illicit affair with Candy. He also gets mixed up with the dramas of the workers as one of the women has an unwanted pregnancy. However things take a turn when Wally returns from action paralysed and Dr Larch's health worsens and Homer feels the need to return to the orphanage.The film is a sweet tale with dark themes which can blind side you with the scenes involving the young kids watching King Kong. It is a film of Homer being protected from the world and discovering it himself the good and the bad.Caine gives a strong performance as the kindly Dr Larch. An actor who was never good at accents but gives a good New England flavour here. He won his second Best Supporting Actor Oscar.

Its Oscar- winning, Irving-scripted screenplay, I reasoned, was about the only chance I had of being convinced otherwise.The Cider House rules follows the story of the unadoptable orphan Homer Wells. Trained in obstetrics by the orphanage founder and ether addict Dr Wilbur Larch, Homer grows up being told that he must be of use. When a young couple comes in search of Larch's less legal form of delivery, the now adult orphan is motivated to return home with them to experience life outside the orphanage.What I like&#x97;nay, love&#x97;about Irving's writing is its comprehensiveness the encompassing, breathtaking scale of how he writes. His novels often follow characters from youth to old age; from birth to death; from one extreme to t'other. The book-to-film transition is one of the most difficult jumps to make between media, and one which so rarely works to create a brilliant offspring. But enough of that for now. The Cider House Rules about which I write is the film, and must be judged as such. The beginning offers us a quick introduction to life at the St Cloud's Orphanage and to Homer Wells and his mentor, harried ever so slightly by the irritating and mawkishly sentimental music which floats at the threshold of audibility&#x97;it's so cliché as to be emetic. This is a minor problem however in the face of Michael Caine's performance&#x97;the cause of the film's well deserved second Oscar; the way in which he masks his distinctive accent alone is fascinating. The scenes of the emotional Caine are clearly the best the film has to offer, his quiet moments of breakdown genuinely quite moving. Unfortunately much of the film is spent away from St Cloud's, dealing with Homer's budding romance with Candy. The relationship never seems quite as complex or well-explored as it could be, doing little to really draw the audience into it. Little in the film is especially captivating, just barely hanging onto our attention as it lightly brushes themes and topics without ever really doing much with any of these. It remains consistently interesting, but never anything much more. Ultimately, this film suffers the same fate as the film version of Garp in attempting to bring a wide-ranging comprehensive story to the big screen, it loses the thematic and character depth of the source material. Whilst it does a fair job of exploring the rules with which we govern ourselves&#x97;the crucial cornerstone of the novel&#x97;it feels somehow incomplete. And despite the wonder of Caine's performance, his Larch is never so engrossing as the one on paper.Never boring, but never compelling, The Cider House Rules turns a fantastic novel into a just-better-than-mediocre film. Strong performances nevertheless and a touch of the book's important message give something of a positive spin however. Doing nothing so much as highlighting the gross differences betwixt the two media, it proves further to me that Irving is inherently unfilmable.

The doctor also performs abortions as needed. The young man, played by Tobey Spiderman McGuire, eventually takes off with one of the young lasses to see how the rest of the world operates. When he returns to the doctor, nothing is the same. Caine is great, McGuire is McGuire, and the film sort of hangs there. Worth a look, but be prepared. It is an Irving story, after all. And a Lasse Shipping News Hallstrom movie. I have read several Iriving works and watched two or three film adaptations of his works. There is a perverseness to all of them that is different and more elusive than, say, the works of Kurt Vonnegut, another major 20th century writer and (very) roughly Irving's contemporary. Approach with caution.

Homer however wants to see the world. He leaves with a young couple and takes a job picking apples. What does his future hold, and will he ever return to St Cloud's ?Scripted by John Irving (who has a cameo as the stationmaster) from his novel, this is an evocative, charming and thought-provoking period-drama with a great cast, a highly original setting and skillful direction. The only thing I'd change about it is the pace - the first quarter with Caine in the orphanage is pure magic, but when it moves to the ménage à trois subplot it becomes a much more conventional love story; I'd have liked more of the former and less of the latter. The relationship between Homer and Dr Larch is much more interesting, and Homer's naivety, moral instincts and quiet unassuming nature make him a wonderful leading character. The movie is brilliantly cast - Maguire's subtle, soft-spoken portrayal of Homer is right on, and this Caine is superb, giving one of his very best performances (he won an Oscar, as did Irving), and all the children are terrific, particularly Culkin (Buster) and Diamond (Curly). Rachel Portman's score is wonderful, an exercise in heartfelt piano and strings, which is guaranteed to make even the stoniest heart break. This is a great humanitarian film, dealing with death, loss of innocence, unwanted pregnancies and unloved kids with great sensitivity and completely from the point of view of those affected. A fine bow in Swedish director Halström's distinguished career.

For some reason or another I thought I wouldn't like it all that much, despite the fact that it gets so many good comments from many reviewers. But when it was shown on television a couple of days ago, I decided to tape it and to finally watch it, so that once and for all I would know what this movie would be like.Homer Wells has grown up in an orphanage in a small and remote town where the only strangers that visit it, come to have an abortion, to give birth to an unwanted child or to adopt one. Homer was never adopted, but has become the favorite of orphanage director Dr. Larch, who has thought Homer everything he knew about medicine. Now Homer has become a skilled, but unlicensed physician who takes care of the other children and helps women giving birth. But he knows that there is more in life than the orphanage and he wants to see something of the outside world. When Wally and Candy visit the orphanage for an abortion, Homer leaves, much against Dr. Larch's will, with them to work on Wally's family apple farm. But soon after their arrival Wally has got to go back to the war in Asia (it's 1943), leaving Homer and Candy alone together. With a lot of problems on the farm and the loneliness that's never far away, they soon grow closer together...With a story like this one, this could easily have become a syrupy TV-movie, but Lasse Hallström has avoided that trap perfectly. Not that I expected otherwise. I've seen his What's Eating Gilbert Grape and Chocolat before and I liked both movies, but even the best director can sometimes chose a completely wrong way of telling a story. But he hasn't, with his choice to make this movie emotional, but not extremely sentimental, he is able to keep a large audience interested. And even though the movie conveys a message about pro-abortion (which is fine by me, but which could cost him a lot of viewers), he never forces it down your throat. I guess that the fact that they have made doctor Larch pro-abortion and Homer Wells pro-life gives both sides a reason to like this movie.Next to the good story, this movie also has some very fine acting to offer. Tobey Maguire was very well casted as Homer Wells and his performance makes that not all attention is drawn towards him, but allows you to see the other people in the story as well. Charlize Theron also did well and made her role as the main character in a difficult romance look a lot better than what you might expect. Michael Caine's performance was OK as well, but it's Erykah Badu and Heavy D who surprised me the most. Both aren't exactly known as actors, but what they did in this movie was more than OK.Overall this is a good movie that could have gone wrong in many departments. It's probably only thanks to Hallström that it didn't happen. I liked the story as well as the acting, even though it isn't as perfect as some people say. Still, it's more than just worth a watch and that's why I give this movie arating in between 7/10 and 7.5/10.

That's the only reason why someone would come to Dr. Larch (magnificent performed by Michael Caine), the chief of the orphanage. But under his management the orphanage had become also an harbourage for women who got undesirably pregnant. His job to guard over the kids is getting familial, when Homer Wells (convincingly played by Tobey Maguire) gets into his life.Their very intimate relationship is one of the most important things in this movie. It's a very close father-son relationship and that's also one of my personal favourite topics in this movie. But for every child comes the time when it wants to explore and discover the world. Since Homer was a child, he has been instructed by his mentor in medical science. Now, nearly grown up, its finally time for him to leave his protecting environment.He sees his chance come when the young woman (a beautiful and adorable Charlize Theron) wants to have an abortion. And from the that point Homer Wells' life is going to change completely. Far away from home he has to face new challenges of life. The different people he meets are of a very different origin and the foreign feelings are the wideband of human emotions Anger, Fear, Pain and Love.

However, for all the eloquence of Michael Caine's character, the film wimps out and goes for a mushy compromise.  I am refering to the fact the Caine character dies as a ether addict, which one reviewer saw as a punishment for his activities, while the Tobey Maguire character, who is pro life in stance, agrees to perform an abortion for a woman who was a victim of incest.  Only the most rigidly fanatically pro lifers oppose abortions under that kind of circumstance and the film comes off as too cowardly to cowardly to take a real stand for a woman's right to chose.That kind of film may satisfy the studio bean counters, but I want films with the backbone to take a stand on a difficult topic such as this.

At least the orphan boys get a salute before lights out.  The girls get nothing but dour little prayer-speeches from a nurse.  The administrator, a doctor, pumps up the self-esteem of his young charge and right-hand-man by teaching him the cheerful little art of abortion.

There were also moments which transcended their celluloid medium and breathed with life.  On balance, however, this film didn't offer life, and neither could it provide an audience with death.  Instead, it gave to viewers meaninglessness, and showed us characters whose empty lives were only irrelevant interludes between eternity and nothing.Homer Wells was a foundling adopted by Dr. Larch, director of the St. Clouds Orphanage in Maine circa 1932.  Studying medicine under Larch, Homer becomes an accomplished obstetrician and gynecologist by his late teens.Unlike his mentor, Homer would not perform then-illegal abortions.  Though stopping short of condemning abortion, Homer is clearly an idealistic young man with a growing sense of morality.   But right and wrong have no place in St. Clouds, where only expediency holds sway.  Against the advice of Dr. Larch, Homer Wells leaves the orphanage to set his fledgling idealism free upon the world.It would be a sorely one-sided contest.  Homer's nascent morality, badly nurtured at home, quickly succumbs to the hardships of life.  What had been character becomes pragmatism instead, and Homer surrenders what is right to whatever works right now.  In the end, he returns to St. Clouds to become its newest disillusioned-but-enlightened director.In the most memorable line from the film, Dr. Larch bids to his charges `Good night, you princes of Maine, you kings of New England.'

Great acting by Tobey Maguire, Charlize Theron, Michael Caine, and Delroy Lindo. The plot and the scenery was also interesting. BUT, I don't understand why it was nominated for Best Picture and how it won Best Adapted Screenplay?John Irving's screenplay condenses his book into a neat little package. Everything happens too quickly--not enough time was spent on how the romance developed and how strongly the characters despised the Cider House rules.Yet, if the quick plot advances don't disturb you that much, you should enjoy the film. I do believe that P.T. Anderson's Magnolia was much more deserving of a Best Picture nomination than The Cider House Rules. Magnolia was a ground-breaking and influential movie. The Cider House Rules tries to be that, but fails.I also disagree that John Irving deserved winning Best Adapted Screenplay for this film. The Cider House Rules does not leave you with the same haunting feelings and energy that the The Green Mile did. Overall, the Cider House Rules was a great effort and should be considered a movie worth seeing.

I never read the books. That's why I watch the movie!! Since Irving wrote both the book and the screenplay, they both have to be great!!  rate this about 8.5 of 10, a really enjoyable and thoughtful movie.Until I saw the film I had no idea of the meaning of the title. As we learn, Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire)was adopted then returned several times. He finally leaves the orphanage to experience life and ends up bunking in the cider house with the apple-picking crew, and there are rules posted on the wall. However, since no one else can read, what's the meaning? The title becomes a metaphor for the need for each of us to break rules at times when the situation demands it.Charlize Theron is beautiful and great as his love interest. Michael Caine won the oscar for best supporting actor in his role as the orphanage doctor.SPOILERS FOLLOW The doctor has become the father figure for Homer, and groomed him to replace him, teaching all he knows about being a doctor. However, without even a high school education, much less an M.D., Homer leaves and earns his keep as both an apple picker and as a lobster fisherman. He encounters a situation where the father, the crew chief, has impregnated his daughter. Homer does not believe in abortion, but he recognizes the devastation to the daughter so he performs the procedure. He falls for the girl, whose boyfriend is a military pilot in 1943 and 1944 during the war. He becomes infected and paralyzed below the waist. The girl must choose, and she stays with her old boyfriend.Meanwhile the doctor, who puts himself to sleep using ether, accidently overdoses and dies. So Homer is summoned back to the orphanage where, through some creative copying, ends up with a medical diploma, and he becomes the new orphanage doctor. Thus coming full circle, he has found his role in life.Irving also wrote The World According to Garp and The Hotel New Hampshire. I didn't read those either but found both movies offbeat and enjoyable. Cider House Rules in a similar sense mixes drama, comedy, and heartbreak to give a balanced perspective of what life really is like.I saw the film on DVD. The picture is just about perfect, one of the best I've seen. Of special note is the French language track that is available as an option. I viewed several scenes in French and found it also to be one of the best dubbings I've ever seen. Not only are the mouth movements very well synchronized, but the vocal qualities in French are very similar to those of the characters in English, increasing the realism.  The DD 5.1 surround was pleasant, but this type of film has very little in the rear surround channels.

BUT still just a personal agenda dressed up in a Hollywood costume and called 'art'. The real plot here is behind the script. This movie (and its writer) promotes and defends abortion. It suggests a representation of both sides, 'of course'. But the one (Homer) who (mildly and without much explanation) opposes it ultimately compromises his position in favor of abortion. Interesting; he does make a comment earlier about Dr. Larch playing God, when thats what Homer ends up doing himself. This movie advocates unrestrained sexual behaviour and advocates abortion as the resolve for the poor souls who got tagged by one of its obstacles; conception. It employs an ugly and emotional issue of the incestuous pregnancy as either an attempt to stifle the pro-life viewer, or, considering the historical political compromise made concerning incest and rape pregnancies, to suggest a hypothetical common ground for both sides. Either way you're paying your money to have this agenda fed to you, NOT to be entertained.

The screenplay adaption written by Irving was disturbingly unfocused.  I saw this film expecting the great American film that every one was talking about but what I got was a very undisciplined screenplay about a character who goes through little if any catharsis.  Homer's so called odyssey was nothing more that a summer job away from home, a daytrip in it's adversity.  He doesn't go to war, but picks apples instead due to his weak heart.  By the time he comes home, via doctored degrees in medicine, we don't care, he hasn't gone through anything significant that the average person doesn't confront on any everyday level.  We are supposed to feel happy when he returns, but I was very disappointed that he returned.  Homer still had a lot more to discover than what is presented.  The abortion motif in the film, which I was frankly surprised by late in the film,  not for any silly moral reason (I agree that Abortion should be legal) but by it's seemingly disguised nature.  The film isn't about abortion, it's not about Homer's odyssey either.  It isn't about anything.  Every theme is left bare The Cider House rules which show up late in the film creates no significant weight.  I am sure that Irving will tell the audience that it means the silliest of rules are most often obeyed, but by the time Homer burns them I had forgotten about them, not by ignorance but by it's lack of importance. What is left after the lights go up is a very shallow manipulative, but beautifully photographed postcard that is just as dispensible.

We meet Dr. Larch (saving grace Michael Caine), a patriarchal orphanage director who, in private, sucks as much gas as Dennis Hopper in Blue Velvet and performs illegal abortion in the back room, dumping the fetuses out in the incinerator. I just give these women what they want, presses Larch, an orphan or an abortion.Larch's medical prodigy and surrogate son is one of the older orphans named Homer Wells (grotesquely dull Tobey Maguire), a teenager who knows all about birthin' babies, yet, for artificial-sounding moral reasons, refuses to participate in the abortions. When a friendly Air Force pilot (Paul Rudd) and his platinum-blond fiancie, Candy (Charlize Theron) arrive at the orphanage for a first-trimester abortion, Homer decides to hitch a ride with them in order to explore the outside world. His journey is bound to be haphazard and undetermined, and the tough-lover Dr. Larch is opposed to it, but acts aloof.Charlize Theron, by the way, is as laughably bad here as she was in this summer's Astronaut's Wife--and equally easy on the eyes. She is perhaps the only actress who can get away with looking so damn stunning post-operation. She pulls off the unthinkable--she actually makes abortion look sexy!While on his travels, Homer toils along with a kindly crew of black apple pickers, headed by the intensified actor Delroy Lindo from Clockers (whose role here is far too unrealized to even be considered offensive) and R&B artist Erykah Badu as his tight-lipped daughter. Homer also falls for Candy (or so he thinks), who lives on the same property as the apple cider house, and whose fiancé' has conveniently gone off to fight in the war.As it murderously belabors their romance with much too little parallel action, the film seems to be boring itself to death. The script calls for the characters to be engaging in an affair that is both passionate and chilly, yet Maguire and Theron are unthawable in their disastrous scenes together. Even when they make love, Theron's expression is spiritless enough to make one remark that she has a 5-inch icicle inside her--and indeed coming from Maguire, she very well might. This might be the oddest couple of all time, that is if it weren't for the even nuttier actualization of Maguire and pop-songstress Jewel in Ride with the Devil.

The Cider House Rules is a classic example of that rule. Tobey Maguire plays Homer Wells in this story of a young man raised in an orphanage desperately searching for his identity and his destiny. I have to confess that from a personal point of view, that was the first problem with the movie. Maguire, to me at least, is not a first rate actor. He's not bad, but lacks the power to be a lead actor. The same applies in this movie. Maguire is OK, but not great. Michael Caine offers a good performance as Dr. Wilbur Larch, the operator of the orphanage Wells was raised in, but he doesn't have enough of a presence in this movie to make a huge impact. Charlize Theron was good as Candy, Homer's love interest, but it was hardly a role that stretched her talents. The best performance, in what to me became the most interesting of the several sub-plots in the movie, was offered by Delroy Lindo as Mr. Rose, who, as the head of the apple-picking team, teaches Homer everything there is to know about apples.The problem with the movie wasn't with the individual performances. They were all - I'll say it again - OK. It's just that I really didn't think that the cast meshed all that well as a team (in particular, Theron and Maguire just aren't a credible couple.) On top of that they were burdened with a dull, slow-moving script that seemed to take forever to get going. The movie picks up in the last half-hour or so, but only to a crawl, and the end is completely predictable. How this ever got nominated for an Academy Award is completely beyond me. I give it 3/10.

For one thing, the film often comes off as much as a sermon as it does as a story.  I think most of the other socially minded films of the year, such as The Insider and The Hurricane, avoid this, but The Cider House Rules is awfully bogged down by its central issue, abortion.  There's just a few too many instances in which somebody says something like If only she had gotten an abortion or This is what happens when somebody doesn't get an abortion.  Come on.  Isn't that just a little patronizing?  Generally, whenever someone says something like this, the movie has already argued this point through the progression of its story.  Its like John Irving doesn't expect us to understand his argument unless he bludgeons us with it.  And, by the way, Christians will probably be at least a little offended as the film does have some specifically anti-Christian dialogue.Furthermore, I don't really think The Cider House Rules presents abortion entirely realistically.  Anyone who's even a little familiar with the subject knows that women who have abortions experience tremendous emotional stress, yet Theron's character seems unaffected by her abortion.Also, the leads aren't that appealing.  Maguire really underacts, his voice rarely showing any sign of inflection.  I don't like Theron's character either, but I think that's because she's written rather one-dimensionally.  No actress could have done much with that character.What I do like about the movie though is the subplot involving the Roses.  In fact, I'm going to go against the grain again here and argue that Delroy Lindo delivers the film's most interesting performance.  I mean, Michael Caine is effective in his role, true, but Lindo commands your attention any time he's on the screen.  The plot twist involving his character is the film's most interesting by far.  But it's too little and much too late, for most of The Cider House Rules is, at best, average and, at worst, condescending.  5/10 "},{"Title":"The Cider House Rules is a beautiful yet ultimately immoral movie.","Date":"29 July 2002","Score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  It's hard to criticize this film without mentioning moralistic objections, and I won't try to. Don't get me wrong, The Cider House Rules -- named after a list of do's and don't's hanging on the wall of a cabin by an apple orchard -- has a lot of scenic beauty and a wonderful score. It was just very difficult for me to watch it because I am very pro-life (if you haven't already figured out, the movie deals a lot with abortion). It's not the central pivot of the plot, but it stands out enough that it's almost impossible to ignore it. Let me examine the pros of the film first, though as I already mentioned, the filmography is breathtaking. The characters are all very interesting and well-developed, and the soundtrack is outstanding. The story is about an orphaned child (Tobey Maguire) who grows to become a doctor in the adoption/abortion home he lives in. After so many years of living there, however, ~*~ POSSIBLE SPOILERS ~*~ he finally gains an opportunity to go with a young soldier and his beautiful girlfriend (Charlize Theron) to an apple orchard in Maine. Naive and starry-eyed, Homer Wells (Maguire) becomes an apple-picker and falls in love with Candy (Theron). This all seems fine and dandy, but trust me there are many problems with this film. Not only is it pro-choice, but it glorifies an abortion doctor (played by Michael Caine in his Oscar-winning role) who likes to get high on ether and hates Christians (and we're supposed to feel sorry for him when he ~*~ SPOILER ~*~ o.d.'s?). It also shows no sign of opposition towards promiscuous pre-marital sex since Homer ~*~ SPOILER ~*~ sleeps with Candy many times while her boyfriend is away at war. The film turns even MORE pro-choice when the one character you thought would continue to stand tall in his opposition towards abortion ~*~ SPOILER ~*~ BECOMES an abortionist (and this defeated The Green Mile AND The Insider for Best Screenplay?). I am also very shocked that this movie got away with a PG-13 rating, since there are many thematic elements, quite a bit of nudity, multiple scenes of sexuality, portrayals of abortions, and a murder/suicide scene.

Growing up, Homer (Spider-Man's Tobey Maguire) gained medical knowledge and learnt the service of abortion (illegal). But Homer yearns to make his own life away from the orphanage, so when couple Wally Worthington (Friends' Paul Rudd) and pregnant Candy Kendall (Monster's Charlize Theron) come along, he hitches a ride with them to start his own life. Wally goes off to war, and Homer starts working for Arthur Rose (Ransom's Delroy Lindo) picking apples, for eating and cider (explains the title, the cider house has rules the workers have to obey). After being very good friends, Homer and Candy eventually give into temptation and fall for each other without anyone knowing. Homer's new life crumbles though when he gets involved with other people's problems, e.g. he finds out Arthur is abusing his own daughter, and he performs Candy's abortion. In the end, after the death of Dr. Larch he decides to leave Candy, when Wally comes back, and go home to the orphanage to be the new manager. Also starring Jane Alexander as Nurse Edna, Kathy Baker as Nurse Angela, Kieran Culkin (Macaulay's brother) as Buster, Kate Nelligan as Olive Worthington and J.K. Simmons as Ray Kendall.

This will give you the right perspective. In the movie itself many things are told in a specific way or simply omitted. Also, the characters are flat, the plot is straight and simple - in the book you really feel what they think and feel. But this is obvious, movie is just a movie and you can't copy 700 pages of a book into 2 hrs movie. Let's get to the point. The main character (Homer Wells), an orphan, leaves the orphanage, he copulates with the girl-friend of his friend (in Irvings book they (Homer and girl) have a children and the story goes for like 15 years or more - this is shortened in the movie very much). The friend goes to the war and the couple is not sure what to do. Other main character, a doctor (Wilbur Larch), abortionist with virtually a lust for abortions and proving in hundred ways the rationale for this kind of assistance to women's needs, is a drug-addict, convincing everyone that abortion is just the solution when a woman has trouble. There is NOT even 2 arguments for the life of the unborn babies. Abortion or being an orphan - this is how pregnancy is shown. Only once, in a discussion between Larch and Wells, Homer says it's better to be alive (than to be murdered). Once. All along the movie, you will see dozens of arguments for abortion as a solution. If you are conservative, the movie and the book will make you puke, or at least, leave you a bad taste. But it's not only about abortions - it is about changing the rules. Rules of the world we live in. Another character, who made his own daughter pregnant, is talking about changing the rules - we did not make them, so we can change them, it's our world, THEY (who? history? the world we do not belong to?) have written the rules, not us.ALL revolutions, leading to disaster, start this way. This is one big anti-human, anti-civilization movie. All character break some rules - sex with your friends girlfriend, sex with your daughter, justifying abortions as a solution, drug addiction (just barely shown in the movie, a lot more colourful in the book), breaking the law (abortion was not legal them and the doctor finds 100 arguments to justify it) etc etc. Do not show it to your growing children.

Taboo, Taboo, Taboo.","Date":"13 August 2003","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  *************** SPOILER *************     A charming and absorbing film. Readily appreciated for its superficial story it has darker inner meanings. It won an Oscar for Michael Caine, not an actor to my liking but this time he drops his silly irritating cockney accent and performs reasonably well but not really up to Oscar standard. Set during WWII in the year 1943, ostensibly the story of an orphan (Homer Wells - Tobey Maguire) brought up as the protégé of the Doctor Larch (Michael Caine) administering an orphanage in the state of Maine, the film deals with three taboos; illegal abortions; incest; the unfaithfulness of wives of serving soldiers away at war. In doing so the film spreads itself too thinly leaving many things unexplained such as the ether addiction of Dr. Larch, the background to Candy Kendall (former South African Playboy model Charlize Theron) having an abortion just before her forthcoming marriage to her army officer boy friend. How did someone find an abortionist back in 1943 and what did it cost? Surely it would have been easier for her boyfriend to find one of his Medical Officer colleagues willing to do it? Also since the medically unqualified Homer ends up by stepping into the shoes of his mentor Dr. Larch one senses the implication that the good doctor was himself unqualified. Dr. Larch regularly bids 'goodnight' to his beloved orphans with the phrase 'Goodnight my Princes of Maine you Kings of New England' however this becomes incongruous when Homer's bogus degree certificate refers, in Latin, to 'the Republic of Maine'. The incest occurs between a father and his daughter who are part of a group of coloured itinerant apple pickers at the orchard where Homer gets his first job after leaving the orphanage. The Rules of the Cider House these workers must follow are clearly displayed but, although openly flaunted they are irrelevant to the film. In the language of cinematic symbolism the broken rules are those of life's moral code relating to the film's three taboos. Although that on the discussion of abortion has changed much since 1943 it was absolutely banned by the Hays office until William Wyler's 1951 'Detective Story' with Kirk Douglas. The other two remain as strong as ever; incest is universally repugnant and who is going to confront the soldier-hero returning from the war with tales of his wife's infidelity? One of the rare films dealing with this is John Schlesinger's 'Yanks' (1979)which earned Rachel Roberts a BAFTA award for best supporting actress. In CHR the main action takes place in an apple orchard - apple the 'forbidden fruit' of the Garden of Eden. This was the tacit theme of the popular wartime Andrews Sisters' hit 'Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree' which echoed the plea of the soldier at war to his girl friend/wife to remain faithful '....don't sit under the apple tree with anyone else but me until I come marching home .....'. A later hit tried to give him that reassurance when Alice Faye sang  '..... no love, no nothing, I'm getting plenty of sleep.....no love until my baby comes home.....' Here the left-alone Candy blatantly goes out of her way to seduce the naive and innocent Homer, brought up as he was in the sheltered environment of an orphanage with no mother and a foster father. In one shot we see Candy with a come-hither look on her face as she sensually bites into the symbolically forbidden apple. In another Homer is shown how to pick apples, symbolising his sexual initiation. Towards the end Candy's husband is invalided home paralysed from the waist down after his plane crashes, presumably leaving him unable to have children but the story unsatisfactorily hangs there. Generally good acting all round and, unusually for a contemporary film, there is a refreshing lack of foul language.One petty quibble before seeing this film I found its title ambiguous as the word 'rules' can be interpreted as either noun or verb and still make sense.

Apart from Michael Caines performance (he was good, but Tom Cruise should have got the Oscar for Magnolia - and I'm saying that though I usually don't like Cruise), there was absolutely nothing outstanding about The Cider House Rules.

The screenplay by John Irving is a incoherent and boring mess of floating ideas. The dialogue is stilted and lacks any basis in reality. It is so obviously adapted by cutting and pasting the most important bits from a seemingly endless book. Every single event is predictable ways earlier and worse, totaly uninteresting to begin with. This poor material is dealt a final deadly blow by Lasse Halström by means of his faceless direction. He could as well be directing a documentary on the change of seasons in New England! The supporting cast seems to be wondering how they have gotten themselves into this project and consequently, deliver every single line they are given with unnecessary gusto. With the exception of Tobey Maguire. Kind of interesting in The Ice Storm and Pleasantville, he was such a disappointment for me in this movie that by the end of the film I decided that he was an overrated one-note performer. He created a total void at the center of the movie. He was supposed to draw us into the saga of Homer Wells but due to his monotonous delivery and expressionless face, he pushed away the viewer from the whole story as far as he could. I really can not understand what the Academy members saw in this film to grant it 7 nominations. It was a total waste of time and ticket fee.

I think it was a great crowd-pleaser, but personally I was sort of disappointed. The film was very good in that it brought the right emotions out of the audience with the sentimentality factor(which was handled rather nicely). But the theme and the screenplay and Tobey Maguire I had trouble with. First, the theme what was it? I felt confused when I walked out of the theater what to feel. Many of the moments it showed the comment on abortion, and it also showed the themes such as love, adventure in the world to find a real home, but the themes weren't corrolated well enough to give a strong message to the audience. The themes were all over the place in terms of how it showed that in the storyline. Second, the screenplay the screenplay felt very choppy. I understand that it was based on a book, and I felt that based on book cutting in the story. The way the story was told, I felt as if the screenplay was written just by cutting the non-important parts of the book and just put the important elements for the story and the sad stuff in. Third Tobey Maguire Ok, I understand the fact that the character has a heart problem so he can't get excited. I also understand that the character is not so hyper-active type. But you don't have to be monotonous throughout the entire film!!! I did not see a lot or any character development throughout the film even during his life at Cider House. There should be some type of development, but I sure didn't see any! I liked Tobey in Pleasantville and Wonder Boys, but when he's the main character in a 2 hr + film and he's monotonous throughout the entire freaking film, I get annnoyed!!! Anyway, to sum it up, The Cider House Rules was a decent film to a certain extent, and it sure was a crowd pleaser. Great cinematography, great performance by Michael Caine, great cast(Heavy D! ) ),nice direction by Lasse Hallstrom(i think that's how you spell it...). But I don't think it deserved an oscar nomination for Best Pic.

But the directing and writing were so forced and awkward, even a great actor couldn't have performed well, I imagine.Moreover, I felt I was watching a propaganda film, for it essentially gave a list of things that the writers did and didn't agree with. A film with a message should give the facts to the viewer, and let them come to the conclusions (because a person is given the tools to come to the correct conclusion when the facts are presented; whether they take that opportunity is another matter). But this movie gave the conclusions, without the facts -- and did so quite rudely.I was also frustrated that no one seemed capable of taking responsibility for his actions. The two leads had an affair, but they acted as if it was inevitable, and not their fault.

As Homer grows up, he is virtually adopted as a son by Dr Wilbur Larch, the doctor in charge of the orphanage, who trains Homer to become his assistant, even though Homer has no medical qualifications. Eventually, Homer moves away to work on an apple farm and as a lobster fisherman. Homer's motives for leaving the orphanage are twofold. Firstly, he wants to see the world outside the small town where he grew up. Secondly, he has moral scruples about the fact that Dr Larch, whom he otherwise respects, is carrying out abortions which were unlawful at the time. (The story is set in the early 1940s).The film has aroused some controversy because of its position on the abortion issue. Dr Larch is a strong believer in the right of women to choose whether or not to have an abortion. Homer (himself an unwanted child, who is uncomfortable with the idea that he might have been killed before his birth in order to suit someone's convenience) initially serves as the voice of the anti-abortion school of thought, but later, while working on the farm, he reverses his position and agrees to perform an abortion on a young woman who has become pregnant through an incestuous relationship with her own father. (We are asked to believe that, although he has never been to medical school, he has become a highly skilled surgeon as a result of assisting Dr Larch).The film's title is taken from a list of rules which are hanging up in the cider house, the building where apples are made into cider and which also serves as a dormitory for the farm's migrant workers. Although some of these rules, such as the one about not smoking in bed and the one about not operating machinery while drunk, seem eminently sensible, they are resented by the workforce on the grounds that they have had no hand in making the rules. Eventually, the list is ceremoniously thrown into the fire.One of the key lines in the film is Sometimes you have to break the rules to make things right. This piece of cracker-barrel wisdom is actually spoken by the man responsible for violating his own daughter, which must cast some doubt on his status as a moral philosopher. I doubt if John Irving intended his moral libertarianism to extend as far as the rules forbidding incest, but he seems to want to apply it to just about every other ethical question raised in the course of the film, not merely to the abortion debate.Both main characters carry out actions which, from a moral point of view, are highly questionable. Larch falsifies Homer's medical records (without his knowledge) to enable him to avoid military service during World War II. Later, he forges a number of documents which purport to show that Homer is a qualified surgeon, hoping to get him appointed as his successor at the orphanage. Homer is initially reluctant to go along with Larch's deceptions, but later allows himself to be appointed as the orphanage doctor after Larch's death. (He dies as a result of becoming addicted to the ether he uses in operations). He also has an affair with a friend's fiancée while that friend is away on military service. Irving (who wrote the screenplay from his own novel) and director Lasse Hallstrom, however, try to pass all these matters off as being morally justifiable, shrugging any moral issues aside with Sometimes you have to break the rules to make things right, a sentiment which in the circumstances seems inadequate.Michael Caine has spent most of his film career playing Englishmen; there are occasional exceptions, such as his German sergeant in The Eagle Has Landed, but the only other film in which I recall him playing an American was Hurry Sundown from the late sixties. I will leave comment on his accent to those who are more familiar with Maine than I (I have only visited the state once, and that only briefly), but I felt that his was the best acting performance in the film. For all his faults, Larch is basically a kindly man, deeply attached to the children in his care, and Caine brought this out well. I was less impressed with Tobey Maguire as Homer. As a result of Larch's falsifications, Homer believes himself to have a heart condition and that he must avoid too much excitement. Maguire, however, seems to have interpreted this as meaning that Homer must never show any emotion at all, and his performance seems lifeless and wooden.The film has an attractive neo-classical musical score from Rachel Portman, and is photographed to show the Maine countryside in all its beauty (although, as with a number of other films set in New England, I did find myself wondering why it nearly always seems to be autumn). The film's visual beauty, however, is part of what is wrong with it. There is a serious disconnect between its visual style and its sombre themes. From what I have seen of his work, Hallstrom has always struck me as an overrated director, and The Cider House Rules reminded me of another of his films, Chocolat, in which he also uses lush, sumptuous visuals to disguise some highly questionable philosophising. Here, he manages the remarkable feat of bathing in a warm, rosy, nostalgic glow a film whose themes are abortion, drug addiction, sexual infidelity, suicide, incest and death. 5/10 "},{"Title":"Well made, entertaining, thought provoking sentimental garbage","Date":"16 April 2005","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" When it comes to sentimentality that is so sweet that it would make most people sick, Hollywood is the best at it.Here we have an intelligent story about two things, one about the unfairness of the world and more specifically about abortion.

Clearly the rules were posted by someone who didn't live in the shack and had no understanding of the lives of the people who did.  The metaphor is this the rules represent the religious imperatives we are taught as children, imperatives posted by distant ancestors who don't have to live in our shed, etc.There's a difference between expressive metaphors and didactic ones.  This is one of the latter.  Besides which, two things bother me(1)  When we meet the owners of the orchard, the people (presumably) responsible for posting the cider house rules, they turn out to be intelligent, understanding, down-to-earth - not the priggish know-nothings capable of writing such things as do not sleep on the roof.(2)  More importantly...  The cider house rule Homer learns to disregard is the one prohibiting abortion.  Why did he ever follow this rule in the first place?  Where did his disapproval come from?  No doubt his parents disapproved of abortion - if they hadn't he probably wouldn't have been born - but since he was raised from birth in an orphanage, the director of which for obvious reasons did NOT disapprove of abortion, it's not clear how he managed to inherit his parents' views.  Of course, Homer was free to disagree with his father figure and we don't even need to be told how he came to do so - except we ARE told, through the cider house rules metaphor, and what we're told is false.  Homer was not given ANY cider house rules at the start of his life.It makes a nice enough story without the metaphor, though - perhaps a trifle rambling, which is why we get the impression that someone, at some point, said, Quick, someone think of a moral.  (Note that I haven't read the novel; IT may give an entirely different impression.)  Growing-up stories may be better if they naturally contain morals but they don't really need them.  This one is fine without.  The cinematic craftsmanship is pleasingly solid, and we care about the characters, and that's enough (in this case) to make a decent movie.

The orphanage was nothing more than a backdrop for a thinly disguised social commentary on the virtues of abortion as the best alternative for unwanted children.  The very first scene shows Homer about to throw an aborted fetus into the incinerator from a porcelain pot he is carrying.  Later on in the movie he alludes to the incinerator as the certain future he would have faced had his mother come to Dr. Larch wishing to abort him.  This coherent argument is of course incinerated by the time the anti-abortion Homer meets up with a co-worker who is pregnant by her father. Of course there can be no other future than the incinerator for a child that happens to be the product of rape or incest.  Homer is thus converted to the proper faith.  Naturally, his love interest also has an abortion which is how he comes to meet her. Are you getting the picture?  I'm wondering why, after all the extramarital sex Homer has with Candy, the scritpwriters didn't have her get pregnant again just so they could throw in another abortion for good measure.

A group of African American over-the-tops who are rebellious, basically slaves and get into knife fights while spouting lines like What business are you in boy?  I'm in the knife business!9. Stabbing at topics like incest and abortion, not to make any statements of how right or how wrong they are, but instead using said topics to create an enthusiastic but, in truth, false sense of tension and drama between the characters (or should I say 'caricatures'?).I've basically just addressed every single plot point of the film.  It's really just a collection of cliches, and not subtle ones either.  No, these cliches drip off the screen like molasses...in the freezer...in January.  The actors - except for Delroy Lindo and maybe Michael Caine - put no work in it, they just speak Winkler's lines as if it's their first reading of the script.And the lines!  They're trying to be meaningful and insightful but just end up messily going all over the place, starting a new point before finishing the last.  How did Winkler and Caine pick up Oscars for this?  Caine didn't even deliver the best performance, it was Lindo, by far.  No, no, no, Michael Clarke Duncan should've won that Oscar for his work in the far better The Green Mile.An incredibly overrated film, with the only highlights being Lindo and some of Caine's work, 6/10.

What I got was some boring dialogue between actors who look like they never met before, and an endless string of circumstances that anyone with eyesight could see coming a mile away.Why Caine was even nominated is another mystery - the fact that he won is another question.  I did not see all the nominees - but out of the three I've seen - Caine, Jude Law & Osment - Caine is the least deserving. I will give this another try to see if it was just me and the mood I was in, but I would be very surprised if my opinion changed at all.

That seems to be the Academy Award-winning argument of John Irving's much-rewritten screenplay.  Even if you buy that abortion saves kids a life of hell, it isn't evidenced here. . .because the iconic abortionist hero Dr. Larch can't be shown in a derogatory light now can he?  Even Michael Caine softened him from the written character by eliminating the man's tendancy to shout everything.  Within this sanitized portrait it, his addiction to ether comes off like just a quirk or color tagged onto to what's left of his personality.   The movie may play just fine for people with no interest in tracking the film's political stance - such as it is.  Relying on the tired hypothetical circumstance which only describes two percent of abortions performed, any political teeth are very dull.  The manipulations of this film will make the pro-intelligent-movie-writing audience wince.  Yes, it is a pretty and well-crafted lie, much like the ones I may have to tell any time a woman fishes for my opinion by making chit-chat about this film.  Whatever anyone thinks about abortion issues (and, yes, I mean more than one issue), it is not very well illustrated by the story-points of this film.  Mr. Irving (whose World According to Garp I love as both novel and film) happens to have a grandfather who performed abortions, and he makes no bones about the fact that his book at least may be a way to pay him tribute.  Whatever kind of man his gramps was, the reality of abortion is clouded on the road in and out of St. Clouds.

Everyone is unhappy when the cute boy decides to leave his orphanage and live a life of his own. The boy does a lot of good things out in the big world, too. He gives wise advise, do like this and like that. He is soo perfect.The ending scene tops it all. The cute boy decides to return. Strings, mushy music, no eye in the audience is dry. The happiness is total, oh, he's back.One of the girls who grew up with the cute boy in the orphanage is extra happy. She straightens up her hair when she sees him coming.

Would you call babies (or the lack of them through abortions) special effects?PLOT &#16;% Awful is too good a word for this movie. The basic plot (as this is what it should be called) revolves around ethical matters of abortion or not having abortions. However the pro-abortion stance through life circumstances of some of the characters makes it too preachy and predictable. Surely there are good reasons to have a baby as well. The argument of better social learning and being a master of your own desires is a better way of accessing free will rather than reacting to animal instincts or impulsive emotions and actions? Oh it's really romantic to be waiting for someone who has had sex with someone else while he was away! No I thought not!STRONG WORDS AND VIOLENCE ETC &#150;% Abortion is violent and sick and a movie supporting these notions don't help matters.

"},{"Title":"Slaughter House Rules","Date":"2 April 2004","Score":"6 out of 17 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  THE CIDER HOUSE RULES is a cowardly film. Taking on one of the most morally complex issues of our time, the film hides its pro-abortion sentiments behind a facade of New England picture-postcard autumn landscapes and adorable freckled-faced children fresh from Kodak commercials. Those who oppose abortion are just nameless, faceless rulemakers who should be ignored or naive children who haven't learned about life. That is the depth of the film's political discussion.More than this, the film is about as loathsome and morally bankrupt as you can get. Right up front, I'll admit that I am adamantly anti-abortion, therefore the film offends me at its very heart, because it is unabashedly a commercial for abortion. But having said that, there is so much more in the film to find offensive. The moral bellwether of the film is Dr. Larch, who 1) is a drug abuser, 2) sexually exploits his nurses, 3) commits fraud and forgery to leave his practice to a young man who is obviously woefully ill-prepared to handle it. But, golly-gee-whiz, the arrogant Dr. Larch is so much smarter than any silly old college or government board. All of this unfolds at the orphanage that serves as the front for Larch's illegal abortion mill. But Dr. Larch is played by lovable old scamp Michael Caine, who reads bedtime stories to the orphans, so we are expected to overlook that the man is an amoral creep.Secondly, I found the film to be racist. The entire subplot at the apple orchard exists solely to get Homer into a situation where he feels compelled to perform an abortion, an act he has stated he finds morally wrong. To this end, the film introduces a black man and his daughter, who, at first, seem like kind, decent people. But they are mere props The man gets his daughter pregnant -- that's what those kind of people do -- so Homer abandons his moral beliefs to embrace a more pragmatic (read pro-choice) stance. (This, of course, let's us know that abortion shouldn't be just for rich white folk.)So, a young man rejects his fundamental belief in the value of human life for the sake of social convenience. That he sells out his ideals would normally be considered a tragedy. I mean, if he voiced his disapproval of, say, lynching, but helped hang a man, no one would applaud. Innocence would clearly be corrupted. But abortion, the feminist equivalent to lynching, is somehow a clean killing, a type of death that anti-war, anti-death penalty, anti-fur, vegetarian liberals can embrace without any moral qualms. (How, I'll never understand.)Then there is the issue of the cider house rules, a set of simple rules that the workers at the orchard are asked to respect. The film, however, does not, and suggests rather boldly that any rule you don't like, don't understand, or just plain disagree with should simply be ignored. A line of thought, no doubt, endorsed by any self-respecting sociopath or career criminal. But the cider house rules are symbolic representations of The Ten Commandments (apples, first love, The Garden of Eden, etc.), so in effect the film suggests that basic concepts of morality are to be rejected as well, if they conflict with humanly wants. Abortion is so much easier to embrace if thou shall not kill is shrugged off as a silly, oppressive joke.The film's moral integrity is absolutely perverse. Using Homer as our surrogate, the film expects us to reject the rules of God the Father for the rules of Larch the Father, the drug addicted, sexist abortionist. More than being anti-Christian or anti-religion or even anti-God, the film -- for all of its fuzzy sentimentality -- is cold-blooded and nihilistic. It mocks ideas of spiritual values in favor of a ruthless hedonistic value system that recommends that you do whatever it takes to get whatever you want.For all of its soft-focus beauty, THE CIDER HOUSE RULES is one of the most profoundly ugly films ever made.

It puts a mediocre movie out, and come Oscar time, pours tons into a marketing campaign that gives them so much undeserved attention that those masterpieces walk away with scores of awards. Don't believe me? Last year they won TEN Oscars, and bought every single one of them. Life Is Beautiful was a fantasy, a remarkably offensive and ludicrously overrated Holocaust comedy (Roberto Benigni can't act his way out of a paper bag and we gave him Best Actor--no longer can anyone say this country is racist), and Shakespeare In Love didn't deserve Best Picture over Godzilla, let alone Saving Private Ryan.Why do I bring this up? Because Miramax is threatening to do the same with this *deliberately* directionless, fragmented, zero-plot piece of oversentimental, underwritten and overdirected garbage. Movies like the remarkable L.A. Confidential, which create fascinating, diverse plot elements and actually manage to bring them together to add up to something, deserve Oscars. But the makers of this movie have the audacity to create a movie they know is episodic without even trying to bind the episodes together. It just introduces an event, deals with it a while, lingers to let the emotions of a stupidly captivated audience sink in, then moves on to another without bothering to connect them. It doesn't even bother to go anywhere significant with any event. Maybe real life is like that sometimes, but we don't go to the movies to see ourselves, to see the ordinary. We don't have to pay for it.I'm pro-choice and I hated this movie! If The Cider House Rules wins even ONE award (and it looks like that's going to be Best Supporting Actor for Michael Caine, who worked with a dialogue coach for two weeks and STILL couldn't even keep his accent consistent), we'll know it was bought, not won. Miramax's success at the 1998 Oscars showed the world that there is no such thing as a sure thing--or a fair thing, for that matter--in an Oscar race. Who knows how many surprises it has left? One thing that didn't come as a surprise They released a movie this idiotic and insidious and got seven Oscar nominations. Life is peachy.
