[{"Title":"A Sweet Movie For The Whole Family","Date":"24 August 1999","Score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Sport","Review":"  This movie is in line with the first Air Bud. Not many sequels of this nature are tolerable let alone enjoyable. Air Bud Golden Receiver is a movie that your whole family can enjoy. The movie centers around Josh Framm coming to terms with his mom's return to dating. Josh has to get used to the new man in his mom's life and a new sport for him and Buddy, football. Most people can relate to that being a difficult adjustment no matter how nice the man is. In this case it's the lovable Patrick Sullivan,DVM. The low point of this movie are the lampoonish villians Natalya and Popen. They try miserably to add slapstick comedy to this otherwise endearing film. A very notable scene is between Josh Framm and Coach Fanelli. The parts of Patrick Sullivan and Coach Fanelli were wonderfully casted.

Kevin Zegers stars as Josh, a young teenager coping with the loss of his father and guys, who try dating his mother Jackie. Buddy likes his new vet, Dr. Patrick Sullivan portrayed by Gregory Harrison and he arranges Jackie to bump into Patrick. It works and they take a liking to each other. Seeing this Josh doesn't want to be home much to see his mother act like a teenager in love so he decides to join the football team with his friend. Suddenly Buddy shows that he too can play, but at the same time there are two kidnappers around trying to find animals to act in their circus and they intend on snatching Buddy. When Josh's team the Timberwolves land in the finals with Buddy's help Patrick proposes to Jackie. Josh sees this he runs away from home and Buddy goes missing. I found it strange seeing a dog play for a team not that I live in America nor do I know too much about the rules to American football and I never thought I would see a dog play in a team, but miracles do happen...that and a good dog trainer...Good movie very suitable for kids.

Soon he finds out Buddy (the dog) likes to play football and he and his friend Tom, who played basketball with him on part 1, join the team so Josh can get away from the new guy Patrick. Soon Buddy ends up on the team and Josh can't take someone trying to replace his dad so he runs away from home. A bunch of Russian circus freaks are kidnapping animals and kidnap Buddy and the coach finds Josh and tries to talk him out of leaving and to come back and play in the big game, even though Buddy is no where to be found.Same as part 1 basically. Wow, my dog can play a sport, and oh no, someones trying to take Buddy away...the only new factor is Patrick. I hate how they tried so hard to be like part one and offered nothing new. I hated that they ripped off scenes from 101 Dalmations and stole dialog from 2010 with the Russions saying piece of pie instead of piece of cake..I hate like on part 1 you can tell Buddy uses a soft ball and not the kind of ball the team uses, thats very obvious. I liked the coach here, but hated his lame pep talks to the team. The dog is less impressive here too, all he does is fetch basically. I hated also that Josh had runaway and the family was terrified, Patrick knows its his fault, so he leaves.. If you were a good man you would stay at least until the child is found then leave...stupid writing. I also hate how you know the team will win and it'll be a cheesy happy ending.Acting was OK here, Kevin Zegers is back as is Cynthia as the mom. Robert Castanzo did a great job as the coach and Tim Conway and Dick Martin did great as the sports announcers.Part 1 is okay for kids, but part two is just the same story over again with football in place of basketball...2/10 stars "},{"Title":"Will adults enjoy the movie...no, but they'll enjoy their free time","Date":"9 September 2000","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Sport","Review":"  This is not a movie that I would recommend to adults to watch, however, if you have kids and you need to get the house clean with little distraction put this in the VCR.

Unlike my review for the first movie, there will be minor spoilers The boy in the first movie is now in high school and he's playing on the Football team to...expand his sports playing? Yeah, I'm not really sure either but I'll buy it. Air Bud is still endearing and his relationship with the boy seems even stronger than before. He does try to convince Air Bud not to play Football, in concern of Air Bud's safety. Unlike the first movie, Air Bud isn't the one who sealed their victory like in the first movie. Air Bud gets badly injured and the kid has to win the game. It's one of the best moments in the entire series.

Air Bud is still great at basketball (but terrible at movies).This time Air Bud makes a big splash at football and wins the big game. One person who did not make a big splash is director Richard Martin who certainly didn't succeed with the screenplay the way the dog finished the game. Such nonsense included as circus kidnappers nabbing Air Bud leading to a ridiculous scene where a chimpanzee drives their stolen ice cream truck. Kevin Zegers looks bored as Air Bud's owner. He is basically reciting what he did previously. Cynthia Stevenson plays mother while Gregory Harrison plays her veterinarian boyfriend. Both roles are standard but it is obvious that mother's new beau will struggle to win over Zegers until that last moment when he is needed. Robert Costanzo plays the coach who is gifted with the worst dialogue in the film with lines like, He's not a Golden Retriever. He's a golden receiver. this should have him removed from that coach of the year nomination. Idiotic farce purposed to be a sequel with a message regarding talents. Air Bud has many including starring in lame family films.

It's not a good as the first movie, but it's very rare that a sequel is better than the original, other than Terminator 2, that's a given. But it is very common that sequels are not only, not as good, but intact, terrible. I really don't believe this is one of those cases. I do think this movie is a great watch for the whole family. Young children all the way up to seniors will enjoy it. I do hate how there is always someone who wants to capture Buddy, I mean it's likely that, that would happen in real life, but mean people stealing him, so he can be a sideshow act in a Russian circus. Come On.Overall, I give this movie a 7 out of 10.

In this sequel, Buddy is still top dog on the basketball court - but, now, he will learn to play football just as well. It begins when veterinarian Gregory Harrison (as Patrick Sullivan) gives young Zegers and Buddy a football while courting widowed mom Cynthia Stevenson (as Jackie). Of course, Zegers does not want a new man taking the place of his father, who died in a plane crash before the events in Air Bud (1997)...The adults hit it off well, but are reluctant to hurt Zegers' feelings. Also complicating matters is a sub-plot to dog-nap Buddy by exotic animal thieves Perry Anzilotti (as Popov) and Nora Dunn (as Natalya). The Russian evil-doers are an obvious swipe of Boris and Natasha from the old Rocky & Bullwinkle show; but, they are less satisfying here. Better are over-eating coach Robert Costanzo (as Fanelli) and Zegers' fainting pal Shayn Solberg (as Tom Stewart). Veteran comedians Tim Conway and Dick Martin have fun announcing the big game.**** Air Bud 2 Golden Receiver (8/14/98) Richard Martin ~ Kevin Zegers, Cynthia Stevenson, Gregory Harrison, Robert Costanzo "},{"Title":"Cute and inspiring family film","Date":"14 February 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Sport","Review":" In Fernfield, Washington, Josh is not happy that his mother Jackie is now dating Dr. Patrick Sullivan, a veterinarian. His father's absence is apparently explained by a newspaper headline about a deceased test pilot. Hoping to get dirt on his nemesis, Josh and his friend Tom take Josh's dog Buddy to Patrick, pretending Buddy has a problem. They find incriminating evidence.After Patrick gives Josh a football as a present, Josh shows he has talent, and Tom tells Josh he should try out for the junior high football team. Josh makes the team as backup quarterback.Coach Fanelli's job is in trouble, though. He is not winning games and sports are expensive, so Principal Salter would rather cut them. If you know the Air Bud movies, it's not hard to figure out what will happen.Meanwhile, bumbling Russians Natalya and Popov drive an ice cream truck around the neighborhood, hoping to capture Buddy and add him to their collection of animals.This is a harmless enough family film (unless you're one of the stunt players--OUCH!). It's not going to win any awards, except maybe for being bad (I just feel certain people would have said it deserved worst film), but it's an enjoyable story. Between the hapless Russians and the football players, it's only slightly less violent than Home Alone, but it's all good clean fun.Among human actors, I would say the best performance comes from Robert Constanzo as the coach. He never gives up, and he has a positive attitude.Fans of classic comics Tim Conway and Dick Martin have a treat as the legends serve as announcers at one football game. They make the Russians look like geniuses. I'm not entirely sure the writers took advantage of their talents, but if the objective was to make Martin look as dumb as any character in movie history, they succeeded. These two are fun even if they don't really show why they were great.The best actors in the movie played Buddy. I noticed four in the credits, and I suppose each one had a special ability. A chimp in the Russians' menagerie also deserves mention (no, I have no particular interest in chimps).Don't expect too much--just enjoy.

It is nothing short of disgusting that this film was made.  It has none of the believability or freshness of the original Air Bud film (which was a masterful achievement).  The original is somewhat believable with a dog playing basketball, but a dog playing football?  Come on, who do you think we are?  This film takes all of the magic out of the original, and defiles it into its own twisted vision that I can assure you is COMPLETELY void of art.  Whatever you do, do not see this motion picture.  "},{"Title":"An insipid sequel * out of ****","Date":"19 November 1998","Score":"3 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Sport","Review":"  Air Bud 2 Golden Receiver is a very bad rehearse  in making a sequel in the course of a single year.  The first film was cute, cuddly and charming. The idea of a dog playing on a basketball team is quite far fetched, but he defiantly pulled off enough stunts to save the concept. Even the human story had some explanation to it. Josh's father was killed in a plane crash, so he is sad. And the audience becomes emotionally involved as well.Now for the poorly made sequel. It is terrible. This is the worst kind of bad sequel, the kind that changes the good ideas and turns them into bad ones. The kind that changes the main plot piece in one way, this time, the K-9 plays football instead of basketball. No madder how much time is spent in mind over matter, benefit of a doubt, walk into with an open mind of an attitude you have with a film like this, there is no positive thinking when it comes to down right bad film making.The sequel stars Kevin Zegers as Josh, who is in eight grade. He lives with his mother and little sister in a Seattle suburb. In the first film the human story involved him losing his father in a plane accident, which the audience can relate to, most people know what it feels like to lose a close loved one. In this movie, the emotional plot is a bit more complicated. Josh's mother is dating once again. He and Buddy, his dog who can play basketball, don't like this at all. Why? If I were in his shoes I would love to have an extra parent in my life, especially one this nice. The man's name is Patrick Sullivan, and Josh's mother, Jackie, met him became he is a local veterinarian for Buddy.The animal story is too simple. Josh is influenced by his best friend to try out for the school football team, the Timber Wolves. The team itself looks like something from America's Funniest Home Videos, the can even catch a ball without tripping or plummeting into each other. So when Bud shows up one day, he proves he can play as a receiver for them, and is no doubt the team's best player.Buddy's extremely cute in his football costume. Oh, he is enough to melt the heart. The dog is the best in this movie as well. Too bad there wasn't enough stunts done by him to draw attention away from the fact that no one ever asks any questions about a dog playing off a school football team.There is a very bad sub-plot about Russian circus workers that like stealing amazing animals, of course they try to catch Buddy. But their dim minds are ruled over by the animals and end up doing what looks like a Home Alone scenario to them.Air Bud 2 Golden Receiver is much more goofy than the first too. The Russian kidnappers add a bunch of lamebrain slapstick that, I have to admit made me laugh, at the stupidity of it all. There are way too many sequences that detail a screwball nature and too few scenes that depict the true reason why people will see this movie-to see a dog play football.The performances were also quite the embarrassment. I liked Gregory Harrison and Robert Costanzo's presentations, but the overall acting grade would be equivalent to a D+. Kevin Zegers and Cynthia Stevenson were absolutely pathetic.There were a few hilarious moments near the end by a couple of football announcers, but that isn't even worth mentioning. Will children enjoy this movie? Perhaps, but even they will grow weary when the heart felt discussions become too long and deep. They will most certainly complain that the dog didn't get enough screen time in, and loath over the fast changing script, and protest against the boring performances, and argue that this movie is trash in comparison the origami al Air Bud, as I did.I suppose that they will think the dog is adorable.
