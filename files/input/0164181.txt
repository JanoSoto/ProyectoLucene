Both had good scripts and stories; they were interesting, mysterious, dark, weird -- those are my kinds of movies! They are also a proof that the mysteriousness of ghosts is something we will never tire of or not think to be intriguing. Stir of Echoes was somewhat similar to Sixth Sense but it was also in many was DIFFERENT. First of all, it (SOE) is dealing with hypnosis and has a more 'criminal' as well as supernatural theme. This movie is spectacular and the reason it was not recognized as such, is because it was released just a few weeks after The Sixth Sense - a movie which had already satisfied the audience with its supernatural theme. And because The Sixth Sense was such a hit, Stir of Echoes was shoved aside and didn't get the recognition it deserved. Don't get me wrong! I loved Sixth Sense, but this movie is also very good and if you liked The Sixth Sense, I highly recommend you see it!

It's the story of a guy who gets hypnotised and develops precognitive psychic abilities which he can't control.Kevin Bacon is excellent and shows he can be a leading man, while the rest of the cast performs well. Sets, special effects and cinematography are all very good - nothing flashy but solid. It has shocks and suspense, especially in the first half, and although it could be accused of being a little clich√©d, it never strays too far into the 'seen it all before' category. The second half of the film turns into a more traditional thriller but still holds up well, unlike similarly themed movies such as 'What Lies Beneath.' This is because it is pleasingly short, lasting around 90 minutes (the correct length for a film of this type). There are some plot strands that aren't explained, but this can be forgiven because of the film's running time.Although not mind blowing, it has a decent payoff at the end and left me satisfied that I'd just watched a good movie. Not a great one, but a good one. Pick this one up cheap on DVD.

Stir Of Echoes was not it. Partly due to the studio's financial difficulties, Stir Of Echoes came and went by itself, unsung and unappreciated. Which goes to show that recognition in the Hollywood system does not go to innovators or the best storytellers. It is all about marketability, and while Stir Of Echoes had this, the companies involved in making or distributing it did not seem to want to spend the cash involved in taking advantage. Either that or Artisan and Fox decided to use it as their tax write-off for that year.I have not read the novel by Richard Matheson, so I cannot comment on how faithfully the film follows its source. But that is irrelevant. When compared to its more big-name competitor, at least Stir Of Echoes has the courtesy to acknowledge its source. The film updates the story to a more modern era, thus saving a few dollars, since period pieces are expensive to make. In fact, the dramatic angle of the film keeps it rather cheap, since effects shots are few and far between. Not to mention the effects that do appear are fairly simple in nature. Indeed, Stir Of Echoes only cost about thirteen million to make, according to estimates. Which makes it all the more peculiar that Fox was unwilling to invest a little more effort in publicising the film.Kevin Bacon is in fine, fine form as the film's central hero, a regular guy called Tom Witzky. Kathryn Erbe is also in great form as his wife, Maggie. Illeana Douglas is decidedly odd as his sister-in-law, Lisa. But the real surprise here is child performer Zachary David Cope. After the pretender, that pile of sachaarine garbage called The Sixth Sense, child stars had such a bad reputation that Zachary deserves a medal for portraying such a genuinely likable, layered character. Indeed, director David Koepp took one hell of a risk by placing so much of the responsibility for the plot on his shoulders. That it pays off is a testament not only to the strength of Zachary David Cope's performance, but to the strength of the material he was given. Indeed, all the best scenes in Stir Of Echoes involve interaction between Zachary, Kathryn, and Kevin.I do think this film has its faults. Chief among them is that the story needed another ten minutes to properly develop. Plot threads like the group of psychics, a member of which helps put Kathryn Erbe's character on the path of greater understanding, needed better resolution. One moment, Maggie is asking this policeman why her husband is obsessed with a scene of memories to the exclusion of his job. The next moment, not only are details like the job forgotten, so too is the group and the policeman. Smoothing out intricate plot points such as this would have helped the story no end.In the end, however, Stir Of Echoes is proof that the artistic work one does not hear about may just be the one that has more merit. If nothing else, it is worth watching to see a small ensemble cast that excels. Even small performances like Liza Weil's demonstrate a sense of dramatic flair that has long fled most of the rest of Hollywood. It is for this reason that I gave Stir Of Echoes an eight out of ten. It is worth watching just to see how badly misdirected the hype machine often is.

Kevin Bacon is credible in his part and so do Illeana Douglas. Kathryn Erbe however is stuck with nothing to do for large chunks of the movie. Effectively and atmosphericly shot, with some effective jolts that made me jump. To some, the conclusion may be a little simple and drawn-out, but I thought it was satisfying and filled to the brim with suspense. I find that the digging in the cellar/garden is a nice build-up for the finale, not that it goes on forever as a previous reviewer stated. It's only one thing that bothers me about the ending, and it is that too little is explained and a few threads of the story are totally abandoned. But that's only a minor complaint.

This all changed after the release of The Sixth Sense. It was an huge hit and the movie was the talk of the year. It launched a totally new genre of movies. Every movie of the same 'type' released after The Sixth Sense was considered by everyone lame, unoriginal and a rip-off and a movie to quickly cash in after the success of The Sixth Sense. Stir of Echoes was released only a month after The Sixth Sense and people wanted to know nothing of it. Completely unfair, also since I thought that the script was even being written before The Sixth Sense was and I also thought that filming completed earlier but yet it was released later in cinemas. Who knows what would have happened to this movie if it was released before The Sixth Sense...It surely would had been appreciate more than it was now.I'm glad that the movie by now is finally starting to receive the credit it deserves.You also have to remember that in 1999 these type of movies were still fresh and new, so everything about it was original. However by todays standards the movie perhaps doesn't really seem that original anymore, since dozens like this sort of movie are being made every year now.The story is greatly written by David Koepp, who really is one of the best writers in the business. Everything is build up perfectly slowly and mysteriously. You never know what is going to happen next and the movie offers more than enough surprise. In the beginning you really don't know what the movie is going to be about or were its trying to head to. You don't know if its real what is happening or is it just the main character imagining things. It provides the movie with mystery and an uneasy atmosphere.The movie above all is a supernatural thriller (that also definitely has some similarities by the way with The Sixth Sense, which also might be a reason why it was received so coolly) but the movie also features some real horror elements. And remember again, this was all quite new and refreshing for 1999 standards. I was actually quite blown away by the movie when I first saw it, which must have been in 2000 or something.Kevin Bacon is really know for being the biggest Hollywood lead and he normally plays supporting roles, especially before this movie. This movie is perhaps the first one that truly allows Bacon to shine and show his skill as an actor and proof to the world that he can really carry a movie. It was nice and refreshing to see Kathryn Erbe in something different than Law & Order Criminal Intent for a change. She plays such a different character. It shows how good as an actress she actually is.The movie is well directed by David Koepp himself and he knows how to bring his own story to the screen. The movie further more features some nice special effects, that are used only in the right places. The movie is still definitely much better and more refreshing than most genre movies being released today.Deserves to become a real genre-classic!9/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Suspenseful, well written and decently acted","Date":"30 September 2007","Score":"21 out of 23 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Mystery, Thriller","Review":" Stir of Echoes (1999) tells the story of Tom, a middle aged man who, after being hypnotized, starts seeing things. This is the start of a suspenseful psychological thriller that sucked me in and did not let go until the credits rolled.The acting by all the lead and supporting characters is more than adequate. Kevin Bacon is right at home in his role of a somewhat bitter individual who undergoes heavy changes throughout the film. He does a great job, as do the other actors. The film is shot in a sober and down-to-earth way, giving it a serious tone. Plot wise, the movie is also more than decent, with only a few small plot holes which will only bother the most scrutinous of viewers.The movie's plot does however remind some viewers of other thrillers, mainly The Shining and The Sixth Sense (another 1999 release which overshadowed Stir of Echoes with a larger marketing campaign and larger overall budget). Some aspects of the story are indeed less than original, but the movie as a whole feels different and is very enjoyable.Overall, the movie falls just short of greatness in its genre. I found the quality and depth of the story to be good, but not quite as good as some of the afore mentioned greats in the thriller/horror genres. even still, I recommend this film to every fan of thrillers and suspense.

From the likable fish-out-of-water guy who trips the light-fantastic through a piece of fluff like FOOTLOOSE, to putting everything on the line to play a pedophile in the unnerving THE WOODSMAN, there's hardly anything he can't - or won't do - to show his amazing range.That being said, STIR OF ECHOES still holds what is for me one of his all-time Top Five performances.He plays Tom Witzky, a regular mug living with his family in a working-class suburb of Chicago. Though he loves his family, hotter-than-hot wife Maggie (Kathryn Erbe) and precocious son Jake (Zachary David Cope), he's also a man becoming bored with his life. He wants to do and be something more than who and what he is.Obviously, the old adage be careful what you wish for went right over Tom's head.At a party for family and friends, Tom volunteers to be hypnotized by his flaky sister-in-law, Lisa (the always excellent Illeana Douglas), who makes a powerful suggestion to Tom that his mind takes literally. What happens next will change his life and everyone's around him forever.A 'doorway' has been opened inside Tom's head that allows him to communicate with the dead, and for them to reach out and touch him...whether he wants to or not. When the nightmares that he's been having begin to intensify, Tom knows he must find a way to close that doorway for good before he loses his family...and his sanity. The urgency is heightened when he discovers how sensitive he was before the hypnotic suggestion, in the most chilling way possible...it seems that son Jake can see and talk to the dead as well.In the tradition of THE CHANGELING, LADY IN WHITE and THE SIXTH SENSE, the focus of Tom's visions comes from one apparition in particular, who won't leave him or his family in peace until he can figure out what it wants and why. The situation provides fodder for one intense and terrifying performance, and with help from a strong supporting cast, Bacon comes through like a champ.When movies like this are adapted from older works by classic authors, I usually proceed with the greatest caution. But Richard Matheson's creepy novel has been skillfully transformed by David Koepp, a man who knows a little bit about balancing thoughtful plotting and dialogue with outright terror, (as in APARTMENT ZERO) and the outstanding job he does here will make you think twice the next time somebody wants to 'put you out' at a party with something more than just shots of Captain Morgan...

He sees a ghost of a disappeared girl, and he's not the only one - his young son's been seeing the spectre for weeks. What unfolds after that is that Tom slips further and further into imminent madness. His wife Maggie (Kathryn Erbe) can't fathom his insanity, and it's driving her up the wall, as both of the men in her life are increasingly distant and non-communicative. So what happened to Tom when he was under hypnosis? His sister-in-law claims there's a door in everyone's mind that's never been opened, and it sure looks like Tom's door is wide open, with a big neon sign over it, inviting him to run through with abandon. What's behind all of this freakiness? There's a mystery afoot, but it turns out to be a little more standard and predictable than one would hope with the solid premise. Can't fault the actors, though - this is an unusual role for Bacon, who here comes off as a tough, strong, blue-collar kind of guy - he and his family are close to what one might call white trash, but they're never portrayed as being mean-spirited or hateful. This is just one of those cases where weird stuff happens to nice folk, kind of like the clan in Poltergeist.So this is a stylish psychological/supernatural thriller with game performances by a capable cast. It's watchable and full of chills, but the ending's a little pat.

There's no direct reference to the title anywhere through the movie. That's the only thing that bothered me through the whole movie, really. Guess it just unsettled me. Except that Einstein wasn't a Gemini, he was born in March. He was a Pisces. But that's irrelevant. There are lots of little things that make this movie great. There are so many bits where you expect something to happen, but it doesn't. That makes you look for the next one, when it really *must* happen this time, for sure. And it doesn't. Again. So you're kept on the edge of your seat, waiting for something scary to jump up and frighten you half to death. But it doesn't. For all its spooky and weird subject-matter, Stir of Echoes keeps it simple, and in doing so makes itself even more climactic. Where The Sixth Sense was spooky, this movie is frightening. It's like when you watched Dr Who as a kid and hid behind the couch because you couldn't bear to watch. Kevin Bacon is fantastic, and loses his mind quite convincingly. The 'Dig' sequence, along with the total madness that follows, reminds me of Stephen King's The Tommyknockers. And that book was spooky enough. Zachary David Cope (why do all kids have three names nowadays?) is also brilliant as little Jake, although Kathryn Erbe as Maggie leaves a little to be desired. She's too flat - not enough emotion. And I love the way all the little things are tied up, especially the end sequence with Jake in the car...If you liked The Sixth Sense, this is not quite the same standard, although it's pretty close. If you didn't like The Sixth Sense because you didn't think it got personal enough, this one's for you.

Adapted from the novel by the late, great Richard Matheson, the story centers around everyday man Tom Witzky (Kevin Bacon), his wife Maggie (Kathryn Erbe) and their young son, Jake (Zachary David Cope). They seem to have the perfect life in their Chicago suburban home until one night at a neighborhood block party Tom, ever the supernatural/otherworldly skeptic, agrees to be hypnotized by his mystic-minded sister-in-law. He doesn't remember much about what happens during the hypnosis, but what follows next is anything but child's play as strange images involving a ghostly, teenage girl and past events of the house they live in start appearing in his mind. It turns out Tom has become a receiver, someone whose mind is open to visions of the future and communication with the dead, and that's not all. Tom's son, Jake, already has this sixth sense, if you will, and he too has visions of the girl he calls Samantha. It doesn't take long for Tom to discover that Samantha was a real person who disappeared from the neighborhood but no one in the community knows why or seems to care. From there, it's a race for the truth as Tom tries to uncover what really happened to the young girl who haunts his mind before it tears him apart.I had heard of Stir of Echoes through this site long before I saw it. It was not until recently I finally got my chance to see it and needless to say, I was not disappointed. The story is beautifully crafted right from the beginning, where we first meet Jake taking a bath and seemly talking to his father in the next room. It's only after his father leaves the room and he's drying off that we find out (I won't reveal exactly how we know as to not spoil it) he's talking to someone else. The scene gives me chills just thinking of it and there are plenty more to come. Writer and director David Koepp should be congratulated for being to combine scenes that scare and disturb with a good, strong story. As for as characters, each of the actors give solid performances, be it Kevin Bacon as skeptic turned (almost dangerously) obsessed believer, Kathryn Erbe as Tom's devoted wife, Illeana Douglas as the sister-in-law, Kevin Dunn as Tom's friend and neighbor Frank, or Zachary David Cope as young Jake Witzky. Mr. Cope's performance has to be one of the most brilliant I've ever seen from a child actor or in general due to his ability to be sweet but also a bit other worldly due to his ability to see things we can't. Plus there's a whole lot of amazing supporting actors and actresses, such as Jennifer Morrison as young Samantha, that should be congratulated for their work. I'm not sure what Mr. Matheson thought of this film but as for me, I can't praise it enough. Stir of Echoes is a film that works, not only for the reasons above but in addition, it will make you wonder how well do you really know your neighborhood or the house you live in? And on that note, don't let this gem of a film pass you by. Watch and be prepared for some unsettling truths.

It stars Kevin Bacon as a sceptic who undergoes hypnosis and soon finds himself suffering extreme flashbacks and visions of a ghostly girl with vengeance on her mind. The story has been done to death by Hollywood recently - this came out the same year as THE SIXTH SENSE, which helped popularise the ghost story genre once again - but this film works, possessing a finesse and level of quality usually missing in the genre.The good things about STIR OF ECHOES are the reliance on good, old-fashioned storytelling over blood and guts and jump scares. It's a slow-burner of a movie and writer/director David Koepp allows the suspense to generate naturally. Most of these films have a disappointing back story when it finally gets revealed but that's not the case here - the narrative remains gripping throughout. And when it does descend into clich√© at the climax, you can forgive it for the quality that's come before.Kevin Bacon is one of those underrated actors that Hollywood doesn't really know what to do with, and he's rarely given the chance to shine. Yet when he does he burns up the screen with an energy like no other, and he's on top form as the mild-mannered husband and father who finds himself channelling a kind of supernatural vengeance. His mania is both convincing and frightening. Kathryn Erbe is also very strong as his put-upon wife, and child actor Zachary David Cope is excellent in a creepy kid role. STIR OF ECHOES is a lovely surprise, a modern twist on the ghost story that feels fresh and exciting despite its familiarity.

This experience opens him up to visions and ghostly visitations which turn out to relate to events which have happened in the house he is renting. Eventually he receives a message telling him to dig, so he does.In one of those astonishing coincidences whereby two movies with very similar themes arrive in cinemas at nearly the same time, this one arrived just after The Sixth Sense which, in many respects, it resembles (Bacon's small son can also see the main apparition). Unfortunately, it's not half the film The Sixth Sense is, even without the you-know-what delivered by Sixth Sense at the end.And that's a shame, because it starts off really well. There's a strong sense of location, character, and community, and the sequence leading into the hypnosis is nicely atmospheric. Following that there is a decent sense of mystery and mounting paranoia and obsession on Bacon's character's part.Unfortunately, from there it devolves into a variation of Roy Neary's irritating obsessive from Close Encounters, only rather than making mashed potato mountains, Bacon is digging holes in the garden. I always thought that aspect was by far the worst part of CE3K, and it is the worst aspect here, too. And the resolution, when it comes, is depressingly mundane - a bit more bang for the buck would have been welcome. All the mystique built up at the start is flushed down the drain.And good performances from Bacon and Illeana Douglas (never one of my favourite actresses, but very good here) are unfortunately completely counteracted by Katherine Erbe playing Bacon's wife - as written and directed, no doubt - as one of those profoundly annoying people who you just want to slap (in a politically correct way, of course).And it all started out so well, too.

'How about a kid sees dead people, and they want him to do stuff for them?', or, 'How about someone has a dream where something happens, he wakes up and exactly the same sequence of events begins happening in real life?'. However, as the movie has trundled through production, 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Final Destination' have got there first and, sadly, left 'Stir of Echoes' looking decidedly second best.Even so, this is not to call '..Echoes' a dismissable movie. Taken on its own terms, it has moments (particularly the hypnotisation sequence) of quite admirable innovation and tension. It also has a towering performance at its core, courtesy of Kevin Bacon. Its just a shame that the ending seems to take the easy option; a seen-it-all-before climax devoid of any of the films prior brooding supernatural quality.In conclusion then, 'Stir of Echoes' suffers from bad luck and bad ending syndrome, thus ensuring two things First, that it will be reduced to ¬£5.99 within 3 months of its video release. Second, that any discerning viewer should subsequently take advantage of the offer and snap up this flawed gem.

It's not necessarily that the movie was horrible or incredibly boring; it's just that I find it to be one of the most forgettable film's I've ever seen. I've watched it a few times and for some reason I never remember much about it. I remember the premise of the film and that it stars Kevin Bacon, and that's about it. So I gave it another chance to see if maybe I just hadn't paid attention in the past and&#x85;nope. It's just forgettable. It's enjoyable enough while you're watching it thought. It's not a bad little ghost tale, with a few moments of decent suspense. In the movie, Kevin Bacon is Tom Witzky, a phone line maintenance tech that isn't content with the direction his life has taken. He lives with his wife and son in a small Chicago suburb where everyone knows everyone. One night at a party, Tom is hypnotized by his sister-in-law as a gag, but the fun is over when Tom finds himself plagued with terrifying hallucinations. He is haunted by visions of a teenage girl and feels the need to dig. His flashes lead him to believe that the hypnosis has opened a new door to his mind, and his investigations might lead him to uncover a secret that would shatter his peaceful neighborhood.I guess it just might've been overshadowed by some of the bigger titles released in 1999, but I just don't remember STIR OF ECHOES getting much attention. I hadn't even remembered it myself until I grabbed it on DVD as part of a two-DVD set. It's a fine little thriller with some moments of genuine creepiness buffered by a bunch of scenes with Kevin Bacon and a shovel. There aren't a lot of big names in the film, with the obvious exception of course being Bacon. Illeana Douglas (who was slightly more popular at the time of the film's release than she is now) is in the movie as Lisa Well, the protagonist's sister-in-law/amateur hypnotist. Douglas is a cute face but I've never seen her as much of a dramatic actor and her scenes in the movie don't feel too genuine. The rest of the film is filled out with recognizable faces and forgettable names (including the father from the TRANSFORMERS series) that normally would relegate a film of this stature to direct-to-DVD status. Everyone does a fine job but I feel some blame falls on director David Koepp, an accomplished screenwriter with limited directing experience. Bacon provides the strongest performance while others falter, and I wish the scares had been a little stronger. Granted, this is just as much a mystery as a supernatural thriller but it felt cheap. The thrills are pretty barren and I would have liked a little more torment from the tortured soul of the teenage girl (played by a young and almost unrecognizable Jennifer Morrison).I would recommend STIR OF ECHOES as a decent viewing option on a rainy day when it's playing on cable. It's not really worth spending any cash on but, if you catch it for free, it doesn't disappoint. It's tense at times with a mystery that keeps your interest engaged until the final reveal. I wish they would've built more upon the whole psychic abilities the movie hints at with Bacon and his son. I wonder if these elements were built upon further in the novel the movie is based upon. I should also mention that, while I normally hate child actors, the one in this movie isn't as aggravating bad as most. So kudos to Zachary David Cope for that. Overall, the movie has a heavy vibe of a made-for-cable piece, and it's a shame because I think in the capable hands of a director with a real vision this movie could've rivaled THE SIXTH SENSE. Instead we're treated to a mildly entertaining one-off film that most people probably don't remember. I barely did.

He was great in Tremors, over the top but never less than interesting in Hollow Man, and terrific in the understated The Woodsman. So it should be no surprise here that he elevates Stir Of Echoes up a little more than perhaps is warranted.Stir of Echoes famously followed The Sixth Sense by a month in 1999, and by that stage the most famous twist since Luke met his Daddy had given Shamalangadingdong's film massive (and well deserved) momentum.But that's for another time. The upshot is that echoes was a little late to the party.The odd thing is that at its core this really is quite similar to The Sixth Sense. Without labouring the point this didn't help it too much critically and in the box office, when you've just seen one of the definitive psychological thrillers of all time, why check out something with less buzz and less critical acclaim? This is a minor shame, as Stir of Echoes is more than just OK and the good bits outweigh the bad.The film is set in Chicago, Kevin Bacon plays Tom, blue collar regular-guy husband to Maggie, in the early going we find out that Maggie is pregnant again, much to Tom's concern. Tom finds out when Maggie's sister Lisa blabs, I found Lisa annoying, (but I think you were meant to). The odd thing is that after the new baby is mentioned in the first few minutes of the film it never comes up again, so perhaps it was only introduced at all to convince the audience that Tom and Lisa don't like each other? Even though Tom is clearly in his late 30s and Maggie is pregnant, they get around like a young couple, house parties, baseball games and boozy evenings with friends, it is at one of these evenings in the early hours that Lisa is discussing her hobby, that of hypnotism. Tom is a major sceptic - and maybe it's the beer talking - but decides to let Lisa try to put him under&#x85; with hilarious results.Not really. Doo-de-doo-doo. Doo-de-doo-doo. A pretty funny (when you think about it) scene then follows, Tom and Maggie get home, and after Maggie wakes up she initiates Only-in-Hollywood Insta-Sex (c). Basically she rolls over, lands on top and awayyyyy they go. This is interrupted by very brief and startling visions, (they must be bad, she is pretty hot. Tom certainly married the good sister). From time to time thereafter Tom experiences these visions in the tried and tested we see a little more each vision technique.All the while up to this point the couple's 5 year old son Jake, has been yammering away to someone off camera, often in a non-whisper. For some reason this doesn't bother his parents who either ignore or don't hear his frequent discussions. Now however Tom realises that they share more than basic DNA, and Jake becomes somewhat of a confidante for the remainder of the film.It becomes apparent that Tom's visions are a by-product of the hypnotism, and like it or not he has been opened up to receive signals from elsewhere. In this case the repeating image is of a young teenage girl, the situation is inflamed when they hire a baby-sitter who after a chat with Jake decides to take him to see her mum in the middle of the night. Of course Tom's shining tells him what is happening and they cut them off at the pass, it is then that Tom realises that the girl in his visions is named Samantha, and that Jake can see (and talk to) her. The rest of the movie has the situation gradually unfold.Tom becomes fixated on finding the girl and making her ghost reappear. There are a little too many convenient turns and Hollywood clich√©s for this to be a great movie, but there are certainly some chill inducing moments, and a couple of decent scenes. In retrospect though while one of the chills was good in isolation, after the movie finished I realised that it made no sense when considered in context.Maggie is way too accepting of the situation given the unbelievable circumstances going on around her with Jake and Tom, they see everything, she sees nothing and she just accepts this.Not being from America I have no idea how authentic Bacon's accent was, but to me it sounds incredibly thick and annoying. Example Instead of Hey I'm sorry. you hear Ayyyy, Ah'm sahrrry. The token black guy who gets it thing is DONE! Without spoilers when he appears on the scene and understands everything without being told it's forced as all hell.By the finale I think everyone watching knows what Tom will find when he completes his search, everyone should also know by now that there are no surplus characters in these films, so by the end we have already met someone who knows what is going on, we just don't know who.The ending was a little hokey but the bottom line is that despite some of the flaws Stir of Echoes is a pretty harmless DVD-night movie, with good acting and a serious tone that perhaps the material doesn't really deserve.I rate it as worthwhile regardless.One last thought If Jake from this movie and Cole from The Sixth Sense got together for a play date, how fun would that be? Final Rating &#x96; 7.0 / 10. Probably better if you haven't seen The Sixth Sense for a while, but some solid chills and the movie never quits trying, even when it sometimes fails.If you liked this (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com "},{"Title":"Suspenseful and horrifying story,  well written and directed by David Koepp","Date":"31 October 2007","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Mystery, Thriller","Review":" This creepy thriller concerns about a family, when the marriage goes to a party into a calmed neighboring, happen weird events.

They were all marvelous with a low- quality and repulsive script. The scenarist decided that the middle class of Chicago are dumb and kept them that way for the entire film. The original story was more in the suburbs of the films of Stephen Spielberg mixed with Desperate Housewives.Don't get me wrong; the casting was great and so were ALL of the actors' work, but the script was a perversion of the work of a great film, television, short story, and novel writer. (The author of the original book was, among other things, one of the major authors of many classic episodes of the original Twilight Zone.)The story was ruined by that change, but all of the grunts (actors, crew, director of photography, etc.) did great work. ALL of these actors are worth watching in this film... even if the powers that be ruined what could have been a good, new variation on 6th Sense.I realize that the producers need to make money with this story. So, they lowered the class and the IQ's of all of the characters so that a middle American audience would identify with it. That's a sad fact for the film industry (especially in our epoch), but it's common for at least 30 years. That's why comic books (the same story several times over!) and even boardgames and toys are being transformed into blockbusters. Writers in Hollywood have had almost no original ideas in the last 30 years, but since producers have no idea what writing or originality are, they produce and make money with middle America with stories that are the lowest common denominators in the field. Welcome to the industry of art.I have a large DVD collection (more than 500 titles), but this one won't be added. ... However, I will write to the actors' agents so that I can pass the message that they did great work, nevertheless.

There is something very unlikeable and unrealistic about most of the characters in this film. The thing that bothers me the most is the foul language. When Kathyrn Erbe (who plays the wife, Maggie) confronts Tom (played by Kevin Bacon), she crudely confronts him over his vision of a woman who's been haunting their house; she blurts out, Did you f--k her? Not only does this unsubtle, heavy-handed type of dialogue crop up way too often during the film (and spoken by too many of the characters), it also makes the characters wholly unsympathetic. Don't any of them have any wit or a sense of humor or are they all crude boors who like to get into arguments with one another? Koepp based 'Stir of Echoes' on a 1958 tale by Richard Matheson (of Twilight Zone fame). The inciting incident, where Tom is hypnotized and begins seeing visions seems quite dated. Hypnosis might have been a big thing for a movie audience in 1958 but by the late 90s it's old hat! I would have liked to have seen something a little more clever and original to propel Tom into his supernatural world.Many of the characters' actions in this film are way too over the top. I didn't quite believe that the babysitter would kidnap Jake simply because she heard him talking about her missing sister. Most normal teenagers would have calmly told their parents about their suspicions and the parents could have then contacted the police to investigate. Perhaps the most unbelievable part of the film is Maggie's reaction to Tom's obsessions. She visits her friend the hypnotist who advises her to get help for Tom; but she never follows through. She decides to do everything on her own. Even if you believe that she never notices anything peculiar about her child's behavior (especially Jake telling her to hire the babysitter), she totally ignores everything the psychic cop tells her (spelling it out that her husband has partial psychic powers and the son is fully psychic). She goes home and ends up having another argument with Tom over his visions. It's just too unbelievable that she continues to believe Tom is out of his mind.Koepp implies that Maggie fears humiliation from her working class friends if word gets out that Tom has lost his marbles and that's why she gains no insight into what's going on. I don't really buy it given all the clues put in front of her but even if one accepts Koepp's scenario, a real person probably would have gone for some outside help.Koepp settles for some over the top banter between husband and wife with Tom insisting that Maggie has been trying to stop him from discovering the most important thing in my life. In the silliest scene in the movie, Kevin Bacon, sounding like someone who forgot to take his medication, repeats I won't stop three times as Maggie tries to get him to stop digging up the body. Koepp needs a device to get Maggie out of the house so Tom is left alone for the killers to appear and try and do him in. So out of the blue, Maggie's mother dies and she takes Jake and leaves the house. Even way before the resolution where the bad guys are dispatched, it seems pretty obvious that a bunch of locals killed the missing girl so I didn't find the film's denouement very gripping. There are a few scenes in Stir of Echoes that are too drawn out. Koepp could have cut about 10 minutes from the exposition before the hypnosis scene. The same goes for all the digging Kevin Bacon was doing at the end. Koepp has certainly made a name for himself in Hollywood, penning the the two Spielberg films, 'War of the Worlds' and 'Indiana Jones', which showed a marked improvement over the insufferable Spiderman. Now that he is a prime player in Hollywood, perhaps he might consider tackling subject matter that is intellectually on a higher plane. Certainly 'Stir of Echoes', his earlier effort, will never enter the pantheon of memorable films in the future.

Bacon does a good job in the lead, though it would indeed have been interesting to see Matheson's tale told as originally written. The overall feel of STIR OF ECHOES is not unlike that of some of the really creepy Japanese chillers that were all the rage back in the day. (Matheson was always ahead of the curve, if you ask me his short story FROM SHADOWED PLACES, for instance, published a decade before THE EXORCIST, told the terrifying tale of a young man possessed by an evil spirit in a New York apartment. His contortions are described exactly like those we see the girl manifest in THE EXORCIST. A juju woman is called in to combat the evil, though she nearly died fighting it a decade earlier in Africa. She allows the evil spirit to enter into HER body so she can destroy it. Sound familiar?

Music is scored by James Newton Howard and cinematography by Fred Murphy.Chicago phone engineer Tom Witzky (Bacon) submits to being hypnotised by his sister-in-law and finds that his young son's imaginary friend is not imagined after all...Undeniably lost in the slip-stream of the similar themed The Sixth Sense, Stir of Echoes screams out to be seen by more fans of supernatural mysteries. It's a near faultless production, with Koepp getting all the key ingredients right on both the page and in transfer to the screen. Pacing is often the problem with films of a similar ilk, but Koepp deftly structures it in three engrossing sections.First third establishes the main characters and the supernatural set-up, but the bonus here is that character reactions are believable, especially with Erbe's confused wife, and Koepp has a great sense of atmosphere whilst ensuring we are fully immersed in Tom Wizky's new world of disorientation by way of terrifying visions and red light shocks. Second third brings the chills and the odd boo-jump, again the director is aware that too many jumps can overkill the plot, so they are nicely spaced out and accompanied by a palpable fear of the unknown. Then the last third unravels in a whirl of Roy Neary like obsessions and ghosts of the past denouements. It's a standard formula, yet it's amazing just how often film makers get it wrong, especially in horror. Not a problem here. Film is further boosted by Newton Howard's score that blends the ethereal with rising thunder and Murphy's colour photography, the latter of which helps to paint a harmonious Chicago neighbourhood, soon to be turned upside down, literally at one end of the street. The acting is super, which in Bacon's case is a given to anyone who has followed his career, and Koepp shows some nice and creepy visual filming techniques to further enhance the great Richard Matheson's story. There's the odd little misstep, such as a thread involving a secret organisation that has the gift of being open to the supernatural, that feels like filler to over state Tom's torment. While the post reaction to a suicide attempt isn't given nearly enough screen time to really add impetus to the unfolding mystery.

Based on a novel by Richard Matheson, it told a great story in a compelling way. The visual/audio effects were right on the spot, and the crowd was kept curious and intrigued until the very end. Certain films of the genre keep us intrigued and curious because we have no idea what is actually going on until the last 5-15 minutes. Others artistically and magnificently give original and surprising (sometimes even shocking) answers to questions we didn't even know we had until the story told in them begins coming to a closure. Stir of Echoes was slightly inferior in this regard, as the audience had been informed of everything that'd been going on (no guessing / paying attention to clues involved). That, however, didn't reduce the movie's quality even one bit. Being sort of an underground genre, we usually don't see our favorite top celebrities starring in Horror films. In this case - we did! Kevin Bacon played the role of the disturbed neurotic haunted in a convincing manner we could all relate with. His acting was by far the best in the movie. Along with him, the fans of the late show Oz by HBO were in for a real treat - as we got to see the gorgeous Kathryn Erbe (aka Shirley Bellinger) playing the sexy distressed wife trying to cope with the new oddity that had befallen her family. As for Zachary David Copes, who played their son, I must say I was less than impressed... then again I might have been a little biased. You folks might remember another Psychological/Supernatural Horror/Thriller that premiered the same year Stir of Echoes did. In a great (maybe even suspicious) resemblance, it also featured a top celebrity, and even some of the ideas and effects we've seen in SoE. That movie, M. Night Shyamalan's big break to the cinematic consciousness, will forever be more famous, more successful, and more remembered. I must admit that The Sixth Sense (if you haven't guessed) had one of the best ending twists I've seen to this day, and its ending surpassed and exceeded everything about Stir of Echoes' ending. However, that is no reason to completely neglect and even disregard David Koepp's creation. It's 2012 and I've only first found out about this film from IMDb a couple of days ago...In summary - the ending could have used a little more work, and the boy actor could have been somewhat better. One point deducted for each - still leaves 8/10 with some great acting, a great story, and not to mention a brilliant soundtrack. Guaranteed thrilling fun!

As these experiences increase in regularity and severity, Tom gradually pieces them together to discover the secret behind the mysterious disappearance of a local girl six months earlier.Although David Koepp is far from my favourite screenwriter, having penned such monumental stinkers as The Lost World, War of the Worlds, and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, this post-Sixth Sense spook-fest proves to be a surprisingly effective chiller. A great central performance from the always excellent Bacon helps immensely, but Koepp's writing (and direction) really can't be faulted on this occasion, his well developed mystery providing a good deal of expertly executed scares, atmosphere, and tension before culminating with a nail-biting, edge-of-the-seat climax that rounds things off very nicely.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.

Night Shyamalan phenomenon and his acclaimed Sixth Sense comes a ghostly evolution of themes presented. After Tom Witzky (Kevin Bacon) undergoes a hypnotising session, which ends with his mind becoming channelled as a vessel for otherworldly messages, the hapless electrician wannabee rocker rediscovers a new purpose in life. Much to the delight of his even more gifted son Jake (Zachary David Cope) with whom they now share a common understanding about ghosts, precognitions and visions. On the sidelines somewhat terrified, but mostly frustrated and tired by the changes this has enforced, his wife Maggie (Kathryn Erbe) struggles to refind a connection with the changed man. Meanwhile a ghost of a girl named Samantha Kossac (Jennifer Morrison) haunts Tom and Jake seeking attention and liberation...Scriptwriter David Koepp and novelist Richard Matheson combine forces to deliver a tensive, albeit fairly innocuous ghost story. But inasmuch as the movie fails to terrify or even pull the occasional jump, it does deliver a captivating, if somewhat generic take on the worn-down haunted house sub-genre. Nonetheless despite the lingering predictability Stir of Echoes keeps a vivid atmosphere pulsating, tentatively drawing towards the long foreseeable finale. dark humour persists leading to several hysterical interactions between characters, while managing to avoid ridicule, self-parody or dissolution of sobriety. Mostly however the story is carried on the shoulders of Bacon and Erbe. Bacon as the slightly deranged born again psychic excels in his nervously disturbing portrayal, whilst Erbe steals screen presence with her sarcasm, that serves as a superb counterpoint to her perturbed husband.

Before waking him, she suggests that he keep his mind open.That night he sees flashes of violence and the ghost of a young woman. His young son, too, is a receiver, but while the boy is calm and coherent in his conversations with spirits, Tom is confused and agitated.Over time, the young woman's story comes to the surface, and Tom begins a hunt for her body that puts him and his usually understanding wife, Maggie, in grave danger.....Yes it was released too soon after the sixth sense, but saying that this failed because of that is another thing. Some people just cannot get enough of this stuff, we have endless exorcism movies and so on and so on.I think the problem was that the company lost faith in the movie, released it limited, and then hope people would pick it up in years to come.In that respect, the film has garnered a cult following, but those who claim that this is superior to The Sixth Sense are just wrong.Bacon is great as the increasingly paranoid Tom, and the film is electric whenever he is on screen. The rest of the cast are decidedly bland, and you know which ones have the secrets, and which ones think Tom is nuts.There are frights, but these are all jump shocks, and because of this, there is no real tension throughout the movie. There is a little plot revelation toward the end and a neat sub plot with this son, but the film doesn't have the same narrative structure as TSS, so comparing it to that is unfair.It's a solid chiller, with some good scenes and frights, and a good ending.

I knew even then that David Koepp was a talented writer because of his screenplay work on 'Jurassic Park' and 'The Lost World Jurassic Park' and I was excited to see him direct for the first time here, and he did not disappoint.The acting isn't something that needs to be talked about, because we all know that our cast knows what they are doing. The child actor here is notable because of his realism, which is probably very difficult to achieve with child actors.As for the discussion about the character Neil The Cop's striking similarities to Scatman Crothers's character in 'The Shining', who can also communicate telepathically with the little boy, is done because the novel A Stir Of Echoes was written by Richard Matheson (the same author of the book versions of I Am Legend, Hell House, among others) who Stephen King as cited as inspiration for many of his books and his style of writing. King's novel Cell is dedicated to Richard Matheson and George A. Romero. This wasn't really something I picked up on when I was younger, so it is even nicer to watch 'Stir Of Echoes' again after ten years and still be able to notice something new.This is a film I will watch and love probably until I die.STIR OF ECHOES -----8/10.

Both films involved a family, dad goes nuts and the son strangely can see weirdo things from the unknown world. Stir of Echoes begins very intriguing, especially after the sister-in- law made a hypnotic session with Kevin Bacon's character-- that didn't believe in these things before this. Then, he begins to hear and see unexplainable things that, along with a decent directing, scare and involve the spectator. After some running time, I thought the film would develop to a point where we could understand many things of the plot, but unfortunately, we end up barely knowing why all those things were happening. Basically it appears that Samantha was being raped by two punks and got killed accidentally, so her spirit helped Witzky's family finding it out. So, as you can see, the film is too much of nothing. Another horror film that disappoints. "},{"Title":"A Decent thriller with Bacon.  Mmmmm!","Date":"27 January 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Mystery, Thriller","Review":" Stir of Echoes 6/3/2010This movie starring Kevin Bacon is based on a story by famed author Richard Matheson, whose other work includes I Am Legend, The Box and What Dreams May Come. Director David Koepp is better known as a screenwriter who has written numerous blockbusters like the Jurassic Park movies, Spider Man and Panic Room. Stir of Echoes is a decent ghost story, but has its flaws. Set in suburban Chicago Bacon's character of Tom is your average blue collar worker. One night at a neighborhood party he allows his sister in-law to hypnotize him. This seems to open a door in his mind that allows him to be a receiver of the pleas of dead people. His son also seems to have this ability. In several scenes the kid is talking to his friend Samantha who is nobody else can see. Samantha was a teen aged girl from the neighborhood who disappeared six months back. Little kids being used as a medium for the dead to air their grievances is getting to be a pretty tired plot device in my opinion.Tom starts to have visions and hallucinations of a horrific crime and is haunted by the ghost of Samantha. Tom goes back to his sister in-law to if she can fix him. All he finds out is that he has to start digging in his back yard and buy large quantities of orange juice. Kevin Bacon, orange juice, their must be another breakfast reference somewhere I missed. Tom completely digs up the yard and apparently didn't hit any gas or power lines. He is obsessively digging for the truth, yet his hands look fine. My hands would be a bloody mess after a half hour. He asks around the neighborhood and the police about Samantha's case, but they brush him off. As is customary with most movies like this there is a scene where Tom has to go down into a dark and creepy basement, and an extremely tired use of a bathroom mirror gag. So does Samantha get her justice from beyond the grave? Are the neighbors harboring secrets? This movie is pretty formulaic in its story telling but it is pulled off well enough to be somewhat entertaining. The producer also thought so well of it that they made a direct to DVD sequel starring Rob Lowe. "},{"Title":"A Pretty Decent Thriller","Date":"15 December 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Mystery, Thriller","Review":" I wouldn't say that there was anything especially original about this movie, but in the course of its relatively short (a bit over 90 minutes) run time it provides a fair amount of suspense and a pretty good guessing game. Kevin Bacon was pretty good as the increasingly obsessed Tom Witzky. Tom allows himself to by hypnotized by his sister-in-law, and as a result develops the ability to communicate with the dead - an ability already present in his young son. Together, they stumble upon the spirit of a teenage girl who had disappeared a year before and who seems to be trying to give them clues about what happened to her, and the movie basically develops that story to an eventual climax that was pretty shocking.Bacon portrayed Tom's growing obsession well. At first confused and even terrified by the strange visions he's having, once Tom realizes that there's something of substance to them, his obsession to figure out the mystery grows to the point at which he'll sacrifice even his marriage to figure the mystery out. The ultimate revelation of the answer to the mystery around the girl's disappearance took me surprise - and I like it when I don't figure out the solution beforehand. The whole idea of having visions from the other side is perhaps a bit clich√©, but basically the story works, and combined with Bacon's strong performance and a good cast of supporting actors, this comes out as a winner. "},{"Title":"Fairly routine","Date":"1 October 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Mystery, Thriller","Review":" Much has been made about similarities between Stir of Echoes and The Sixth Sense, however, that's not the main problem with this movie. Nor are its inadequacies a case of bad timing in its release around the same time as The Sixth Sense.Firstly, this is a fairly routine story. Girl dies and attempts to communicate as to what happened and where she's buried. That's the sole extent of the plot and, as such, it becomes more like a whodunnit than anything else.Secondly, for a supernatural thriller, it isn't scary.Thirdly, David Koepp's direction is somewhat bland and proves he is a better writer than he is a film-maker.Kevin Bacon, as always, holds the film together but there are too many borrowed elements and plot contrivances not adequately explained. This has more than a hint of The Shining to it (including a kindly black psychic who discerns the same gift in a small boy). We also see - as in The Shining - a father descending into obsession after communication with the spirits. It also borrows heavily from another of Stephen King's stories - the Dead Zone - through the use of flashbacks.Stir of Echoes is a competently made thriller, but the plot is too one-dimensional to make this a genre classic. It doesn't carry the concept of family disintegration as compellingly as The Shining, Close Encounters (or even Poltergeist) and the supporting characters feel like...well, supporting characters.More scares, a fuller plot and a little more character development would have lifted this on a par with The Sixth Sense. "},{"Title":"More proof that timing really is everything","Date":"17 June 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Mystery, Thriller","Review":" This is a ghost story with working class appeal. It's not about a bunch of screaming teenagers or new age mumbo jumbo. It's about an ordinary husband and wife who try to get through an extraordinary trial the way they handle everything else in their lives, by putting their heads down and just keep going.Tom Witzky (Kevin Bacon) is a lineman for the phone company. He lives in a rented house in a blue collar neighborhood with his nurse wife Maggie (Kathryn Erbe) and young son Jake (Zachary David Cope). They've all got a pretty good life but Tom's still vexed by the dreams of his youth that his life was going to be more than pretty good. He thought he was going to be something special and he doesn't quite appreciate how special it is to have a good son and a good woman who loves you. Then one night at a party, Maggie's sister Lisa (Illeana Douglas) hypnotizes Tom. But instead of making him cluck like a chicken or stop smoking, Lisa accidentally opens a door in Tom's head. He begins to see terrible visions of violence, strange images that he can't understand and a sad, gray girl staring at him on the couch. It turns out the girl is the ghost of a young woman who disappeared in the neighborhood months ago. It also turns out that young Jake has been seeing and talking to the ghost all along. The spectral girl needs Tom to do something and he becomes obsessed with finding out what that is, even at risk to his job, his family and his own life.This is an entertaining little movie that unfortunately proves that timing really is everything. There's a lot here to like but I think it was largely overlooked and has been forgotten because in 1999 it followed and dealt with the same subject matter as M. Night Shyamalan's masterpiece, The Sixth Sense. Stir of Echoes isn't that good. It's definitely worth watching, though, something more people would have appreciated if it had come out a year earlier.Much like The Sixth Sense, this film dispenses with a lot of the standard ghost story clich√©s and finds its own way. It does that by placing ghosts alongside things like debt, alcoholism, adultery and other challenges that families face and have to overcome. Though he's initially freaked out by them, Tom eventually latches onto his otherworldly visions as the special thing in his life he's been waiting for. Instead of buying a sports car or banging a hot blonde, Tom's mid-life crisis is seeing ghosts and he throws himself into it with all the selfish disregard any man has in that situation. Maggie is a proud, strong woman fighting to keep her family together and overcome this supernatural thing that is cutting her off from her husband and son. It's this family dynamic that gives the story its power, not special effects or scary moments. Kevin Bacon and Kathryn Erbe both play their roles very well and manage to keep their characters grounded even when faced with the mysterious unknown.Writer/director David Koepp also manages to generate tension and suspense without having to fall back on too many of the standard scary movie tricks. He tells a story that you might hear from a friend or a neighbor about someone they once knew and it's just spooky enough that you can almost believe it really happened. Koepp does completely blow it in one scene, however. It's in the later stages of the movie where the ghost is getting agitated with Tom and his family and there's a moment when Maggie is getting into the bathtub and the audience can see the ghost sitting on the edge of the tub. It's supposed to be a big, unnerving image. The problem is that Maggie is naked and she's the only thing you can focus on in the scene. We're meant to focus on how vulnerable she is to the ghost's machinations, but all you can notice is how sexy Kathryn Erbe is. It totally discombobulates the tenor and tone of the moment, though any scene where Erbe is unclothed can never be all that bad.The whole thing about Jake being able to see ghosts never develops into anything either. It services the Almighty Plot Hammer at a few different points but it never quite synchs up with what Tom and Maggie are going through or has any point on its own. This screenplay was also adapted from a book and there are a few points where things are briefly touched on or referenced that were probably much better developed in print. That's never too distracting, though.If you'd like to watch a ghost story that could happen in your neighborhood to your neighbors or maybe even to you&#x85;go rent Stir of Echoes. The naked Kathryn Erbe stuff is a little bonus.

Maybe we didn't get it with I Am Legend or The Box, but they nailed it here... this is one of the best Kevin Bacon films and one of the best Matheson films, hands down.We have a memorable use of the Rolling Stones song Paint It Black, though here covered by Gob. The song has a dual significance as both the song played during the girl's brutal murder but also as a reference to the hypnosis itself, where Bacon's character is in a theater that has been, quite literally, painted black.If you hate tooth or finger trauma, and I don't really like either, this film will creep you out.

I thought it would be a good idea to finish off my month-long reviewing of horror and Halloween-themed shows with one of my favourite ghost stories, Stir of Echoes. Stir of Echoes had the misfortune of coming out just after the hit The Sixth Sense. It was dismissed as a rip-off- despite the fact that making a movie takes so long that production would have obviously started before The Sixth Sense came out. Besides, it's not like The Sixth Sense invented the concept of a boy who could see ghosts. Have you seen The Shining (1980)? Stir of Echoes is about as good as The Shining. Both beat the The Sixth Sense.Kevin Bacon plays Tom, an ordinary guy who's hypnotized by his sister-in-law at a party. The hypnosis leaves Tom with greater sensitivity to the world around him- he begins to see strange things. As in The Shining, an ability to see ghosts also comes with a touch of premonition. All of these things point to and start to reveal a murder mystery. One dream provides a glimpse into the intense climax. As the dreams haunt Tom and his five-year-old son, the family begins to deteriorate. His wife is getting upset, there's yelling, it's good drama. The ghost in this movie wants justice, as ghosts often do, but there's also some sympathy for a man who helped cover up the crime. There's less sympathy for the other men who decide to kill Tom to keep the crime covered up- unlike the first killing, this would be a graduation to actual premeditated murder. Things get pretty grave.Unlike The Sixth Sense, where the murder mystery of a child who was poisoned by her mother seemed tacked on, irrelevant to the rest of the movie, Stir of Echoes revolves around its mystery; everything builds toward that climax. Stir of Echoes is just good storytelling, perfect for Halloween viewing.Happy Halloween.

Kevin Bacon did a great job per usual, and even though the film came out w/in spitting distance of THE SIXTH SENSE, i thought it did a superior job..especially considering no one even really knew that STIR was written in the 50's.and if you do enjoy THIS movie, you should know that STIR OF ECHOES 2 is on the way...whether or not it stands up to the original, we'll just have to see.

I knew within the first ten minutes that Stir Of Echoes was a movie to be reckoned with. Not only does it have star power but it also has a believable yet simple storyline.Stir Of Echoes was like a book I didn't want to set down because what was inside was interesting and well-written. The characters were particularly well represented. The screenwriter did an excellent job at writing it so the audience cared what would happen to them.   I was extremely impressed by the actor who portrayed Jake, the son. He did it with such conviction and knew what his role entailed. Kevin Bacon is one of those actors you just know will turn in a good performance for you. This movie is no different. I'm not sure I would like this movie as much if there were a story that had some mystery and substance behind it.I came away from this film comparing it to another film that came out in the same year called The Sixth Sense. I couldn't help but notice the similarities these two films have. In both movies, the special effects almost overshadowed the superb acting. Stir Of Echoes is not to be taken lightly because it is scary and psychologically thrilling. All I have to say is WATCH IT.

It also stars a young child with a connection to ghosts and a older man determined to find out what's going on.  Stir of Echoes I think tried to use Sixth Sense's publicity to drum up interest in the occult, and therefore make it another movie that Sixth Sense/ghost movie fans want to see, but I think the Sixth Sense overshadowed it instead, making Stir of Echoes look like it was a rip-off of copy.  That's the way I first thought I would feel about Stir of Echoes, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Stir of Echoes does indeed feature a child with supernatural connections to the dead, but the plot is actually quite different from The Sixth Sense.  Kevin Bacon plays the father of this child, but doesn't even realizes the boy has the power until his annoying sister-in-law hypnotizes him at a party and tells him to be more open-minded.  This opens a door in his mind supposedly and he starts seeing things himself, particularly the ghost of a runaway and assumed dead local teen girl.  He finds out that the ghost won't stop bothering him until he does the one thing that she wants him to do, and she'll grow increasingly more violent if he remains idle.  He then discovers his son's powers and uncovers a huge crime in his good neighborhood.  The movie is tense, jolting at times, and well played out.  It isn't perfect, with some violent rape scenes that I thought were a little drawn out and a few unimaginative characters, but on the whole it was a compelling, scary movie.

Memories of THE SHINING came to mind when watching some of the characters and their actions. The last half, which is not quite as complex or fulfilling as the first half builds it up to be, is still quiet frightening and is sure to make you flinch if not turn your head. I thought that it brought the story to a satisfactory and creepy close even though it did lose a tad of momentum for a few minutes.

I could also have done without the rape scene.On the whole though the script is a good one and for most of the time the acting is right on the mark especially by Bacon, his wife (Kathryn Erbe) and his young son (Zachary David Cope).

He is revealed to be talking to thin air, an immediate indicator that something spooky is afoot.People mistakenly compare this film to 'The Sixth Sense' when in fact it is much more closely related to 'Poltergeist', or 'The Amityville Horror' - suburban family eroded by the unseen.The thrills come thick and fast, following the superbly shot hypnosis scene, with visceral flashes galore (although the overplaying of the cracking fingernail verged on nasty, much like the bloodshot eyeball scene in 'Final Destination') and clues for the audience to play psychic detective.The ghostly apparitions are deftly handled and shot with a beautiful sinister eye, and the performances from the major players really reveal a family in decline - a unit losing it's grip on reality (another excellent child performance from Zachary David Cope). Other characters are underdeveloped  and some (the neighbours' sons) badly played.Things are drawn to a (super)'natural' conclusion (no 'Sixth Sense' twists here) which unfortunately verges on 'Murder, She Wrote' territory.

I think the story it a little rushed in some places and slow in others, but overall it was very effectively done.  I especially like that the details are all put together in the end in order to tie up all the loose ends.  Perhaps it is unnecessary, but I always like seeing all the pieces put nicely into place.  I think the very end of the movie could have been re-written to be more believable and therefore more satisfying, but the acting and directing are not to blame for this.

However, a movie titled Stir of Echoes wouldn't exactly compel me to run to nearest theatre.  The opening sequence is also more appropriate for the preface of a novel than a movie.  Had novelist Richard Matheson written his own screenplay, he would undoubtedly proceeded in a much more filmatic manner.  So the film remains far too prosaic to be totally engrossing.  Not that there is not a lot to like in this film.  Kevin Bacon, Kathryn Erbe and Zachary David Cope all do fine jobs, and Illeana Douglas is as striking, sensuous and witty as ever.  One direction the film took I did find especially annoying.  When Erbe goes to see the Police Officer with second sight like Bacon and Cope, the filmakers chose to leave the audience out of the conversation.  As a result, the scene goes no where and the film loses critical focus.  Unlike some viewers, I felt showing the attempted rape-murder from the victim's point of view was an excellent, especially horrific touch.

Kevin Bacon's character is slow and has no backbone. Kathryn Erbe, playing his wife, is a controlling, whining shrew. Their child (played by Zachary David Cope) is just plain creepy. And Ileana Douglas is her usual self - I can't understand how this woman still gets work. I had to stop the movie a couple of times just to let the aggravation subside - sitting through this movie is like sitting through Thanksgiving dinner, watching distant relatives bicker pointlessly. The guy sees ghosts. Do we really need to hear an argument about how happy he is that they're having another child? Do the people in his life have to be so unbelievably unsympathetic (oh, you see ghosts, but what about _my_ needs)? And are we expected to believe that this family will just reconcile its differences and move on, as the ending suggests?Also aggravating are the trite and silly methods Koepp uses to pad out the movie. The viewer has figured out the mystery long before it is even brought to the fore, and rather than being intrigued by what will develop, finds himself staring incredulously at the screen as the writer finds yet another way to delay the inevitable. Tell the truth - if you were seeing ghosts and spooky visions, and your son held the key to this, would you actually _listen_ to the brat when he says I don't want to talk about this right now. Of course not. But the characters have to, because the film needs to hit the 90-minute mark. And what happened to the others, met by Tom and Kathryn? Much is made of the fact that there is a secret society of people who can see. Then they vanish from the script without trace.To make a long story short don't rent this. You'll regret it.

I didn't really know much about it, except it shared a few common themes with this year's blockbusterand one of the best films of the year the Sixth Sense. However, I cringed when the words Written for the screen and directed by David Keopp. Keopp, who's been working with Brian DePalma for the past few years, is by far one of the worst screen writers I've ever heard dialogue by. With the exception of Mission Impossiblewhich was co-written by expert/genius writer, Robert Towne, his scripts have essentially been awful. Snake Eyes, which could have been the best detective thriller in years, ended up in the almost bombs category. I blame Keopp, because the film was ingeniously shotthe first 15 minutes are one complete shot, nearly the longest in film history, well directedby Depalma, who isn't always on key, but he's not the worst director ever. However, the script was awful, and made everything look bad. Keopp's work on Lost World 2 was far from great, but his second unit direction was terrific. Now comes Keopp's third directoral effort, his last was trigger effecta film I never saw. Stir Echoes is its title. It stars Kevin Baconwho is absolutely terrific. I won't go into the plot, cuz its all available elsewhere on the site, but I must say that this film has really upped Keopp in my mind. THis film is a disturbing, creepy, and original thriller that really does keep you watching. It, from the moment the plot kicks in, never loses a general creepy feeling. It's excellent scriptKeopp's best is character driven, which is always a plus. The tense moments and jump moments really get you. Keopp's direction is excellent. He plays it like a true auteur. Never too much, and never too little. He shows you something just long enough o make it work. He's not a quick cut-quick scare director, but much more trained in delivering well paced scenes and creating and maintaining an intensity in one scene thats more then all of most horror films can do in an entire movie. Keopp is a much more patient director then DePalma. He allows his story time to grow and develop. He doesn't feel the need to thrust in your face. That is what this film needs. This film is far from perfect, and it nearly becomes formulaic in the final few scenes, but its smart enough to keep itself barely out of that trap. However, even with flaws, this will I am sure be regarded Keopp's best work.

I find it hard to really compare the two movies beyond the similar plots, since both were really good but I'd have to say that Stir was better. It did the creepy thing much better than the quick, tired, redux of many many many many horror films that the Sixth Sense did. Echoes was more cerebral. The scene of Tom digging up his garden like madman all of dramatic, chilling, comical and showed true obsession and compulsion. Acting shouldn't be the complaint here the acting was done well, quite well.

They are a wholly believable relationship (a rare item onscreen) and as parents, warts and all.  The kid gives a strong perf, too, and is less mannered than Haley Joel Osment.The jolts are genuinely scary, and the buildup is even better.  One especially creepy scene had Bacon wake up for the day and go through his morning routine while weird things start to happen, leading to a shock - woah! He wakes up.  It was all a dream.  Then he gets up to go through said routine and the same things start to happen.

There were in the stadium seating and we chose nearer the screen on the floor.  There was definitely no one sitting near us, yet I frequently had the impulse to turn around and be sure, expecting to see someone about to touch my shoulder.  This use of sound works well!If you really want a clever idea that is completely unpredictable, don't bother.  The film starts off well, lots of creepy atmosphere, but it simply ends badly.  It becomes almost silly.  Kevin Bacon does a very good performance, such as he has to work with, but even his character becomes silly.  I have one question, where do these characters live in Chicago.  I want to move there.  No neighbors on the street, in fact, no neighbors anywhere except at the obligatory crowd scenes.  I guess the neighbors for the parties are bussed in from a nearby town!  The rest of the time, one can destroy a house and yard without so much as a peep out of the row house occupant next to you.

It is so riveting, so exciting, and so scary, that you may leave the theater shaking!  Unfortunately, it's a great piece of filmmaking that was released at the wrong time.  Rivaling The Sixth Sense, which has a similar premise, it seems that many people aren't going to see this movie.  When I saw it though, the theater was packed!  It definitely worked for the audience.  People were so scared by some of the scenes, I remember hearing loud screams in the theater, and it wasn't coming from the movie.  In a way, Stir of Echoes is like The Sixth Sense, but on other levels, it's not.  The Sixth Sense was more of a psychological film about a boy who had a gift he did not understand.  Stir of Echoes is more of a murder mystery and a scarefest.  The use of subliminals and the camera effects to show the flashbacks and hallucinations was a stroke of genius!  You get glimpses of something, and although you can't quite tell what it is, you know it's something bad.  It reminded me of Altered States on some levels, because of the quick cuts and the bizarre dream sequences.  It is also very well done.  Kevin Bacon is very good in this film, and for me, it's a chance for him to really act, because pretty much all I have seen him in are supporting roles.  The other thing about Stir of Echoes I liked was how much it lacked the typical Hollywood cliches of The Sixth Sense.  I think The Sixth Sense is a more important film, but I think Stir of Echoes is better because it has the ability to function on it's own without borrowing from any genre or any scare tactics.  I was totally unprepared for the scene where Kevin Bacon sits on the couch and the ghost is sitting right beside him.  The whole audience screamed in terror.  The guy who sat behind me was so freaked out by it, that afterwards he was laughing out loud at how much it caught him off guard.  It was just so unexpected.  This movie also reminded me of The Changeling, because it was about a ghost who died as part of a murder plot, and would never rest until it had it's revenge.  The Sixth Sense has a more important message, but Stir of Echoes is a better movie because it has it's own method of storytelling and it's a much scarier film.  I highly recommend this movie to horror film afficianados, but not to people who are unprepared and just plain don't like that kind of genre.  I am into scary movies though, and I was really impressed with Stir of Echoes.  Oh, and don't wait for it to come out on video.  See it in theaters while you still can.

However, like Armageddon and Deep Impact after it, this movie's timing is suspiciously close to The Sixth Sense.  The plots are too similar for this to be coincidence; Hollywood must be a small incestuous place with frequent attempts to jump on the same bandwagon other studios have invested in. Enjoyment of the thrills provided by Stir of Echoes are tempered by my recent viewing of The Sixth Sense, a more reserved and successful movie.My main complaints with Stir of Echoes include too little exploration of the boys' potential to solve the mystery and too little understanding on the part of the mother.  If the boy's contact with Samantha was daily and his father's much less frequent, then he could have posed the necessary questions to spare his father fruitless digging and speculation on the identity of the murderer.  Of course the out here was the mother's reluctance to allow her son to discuss his sightings.  What a tease it was to hear the boy speak with a deep voice and then never to follow through with it again.  The mother is like Dana Scully on the X-Files, despite evidence to support a belief in the supernatural, she would rather bury her head in the sand and overlook critical evidence.The resulting marital tension was more nerve wracking than mysterious and it prevented many opportunities to explore the supernatural (such as the meeting with Neil in the graveyard). Adding to the tension was the steady closeup positioning of the camera, leaving the viewer unaware and expectant of some sudden intrusion on the immediate periphery, a cheap tactic not used nearly as often in the The Sixth Sense.Viewers crave the supernatural in their film viewing.  Witness all the scary movies this summer including Blair Witch, The Haunting, The Sixth Sense, Stir of Echoes and Stigmata.  A few instances of psychic powers in a film like Stir of Echoes work to attract our interest but disappoint when they are used to launch a more conventional murder mystery with marital relation problems as the subplot.  My advice and wish is for filmmakers to give up more instances and explanation of the paranormal.  Haunt us, scare us, but don't tease us with half uses of the supernatural.  Just once, add a half hour to a film after all characters have been forced to believe in the supernatural and find out where that leads.  With all this summer offerings I still want more films like this one.

It's also a shame because on some levels, on the horror side, it's better than The Sixth Sense.Kevin Bacon is one of the main reasons to see this psycological thriller.  His performance is so well crafted and very well delivered that it appears he was completely meant for this role.  Everyone else plays there parts just fine but it's Bacon's that takes the cake.  It's to bad a movie like this won't be looked at by the Academy Awards, chances are they'll overlook it and not bother to give Bacon an oscar nomination that he should for Best Actor.The plot is very intriguing.  It starts out kinda slow but right when things are getting interesting it dosen't let up.  I had a feeling there may have been some things cut out of the film to keep it moving at such a fast pace and there is a lot about what happens to Tom that you never see, just hear about.  All in all it moves on pretty well even though it resorts to a rather typical ending with a few twists thrown in to make it feel rather original.Stir of Echos may turn some off due to some of it's graphic violence (close ups of nails being broke off, needles puncturing skin, teeth being ripped and punched out, etc.) and Sixth Sense lovers will feel cheated by some of the similarities (kid sees dead people, temperture drops to being very cold when ghosts are in the room) but it's definatly a good time spent.  You may have to see it a second time to catch a few things you've missed, especially towards the end.

I saw the movie opening night with two of the actors in it, and the theatre absolutely was in awe of the movie.  They loved it, I loved, and I know you will love it.  Go see it tonight.  Koepp directs the movie to a T, and the setting is marvelous (even down to Bacon's accent).  The portrayal of chicago is perfect, and the cinematography gives the city its due.  I give it a 10/10, ***** out of *****, and any other praise you can think of.  If horror movies won Oscars, this one would be walking with the show.

I went to the theatre to see 'Stigmata', but it was sold out, so I bought my ticket for what I assumed would be Stigmata's poor cousin.  I was quite surprised to discover that 'Stir of Echoes' scared me more than any movie I've ever seen.  I've seen better movies, but never a more well-executed thriller.  It is a sleek, gripping bit of storytelling, and as such, it succeeds incredibly well.  I consider myself a fairly critical movie-goer, and find fault in most films, but this one had me on the edge of my seat.  Unlike 'Stigmata', which treats the audience like children, 'Stir of Echoes' delivers an intelligent presentation that will satisfy all but the most jaded of viewers.  If you don't like this movie, you either aren't a fan of supernatural thrillers, or you should stick to novels, because nothing can please you.The acting is impeccable, and Kevin Bacon will get consideration for a Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Tom, a Chicago working-class man who complains in the opening sequences that his life is hopelessly ordinary.  As the plot unravels along with his sanity, he only wishes he could have his regular life back.  But something deep inside him has been stirred, and he instinctively knows that he will never be able to guzzle beers and pass out on the couch like his average-guy neighbors again. Bacon seems so convincingly ordinary, and so deeply into character, that I saw glimpses of another magical actor, Ed Norton.  Bacon is even better in this movie than Norton was in American History X, for which he recieved a Best Actor nomination.Stir of Echoes works because it tells the story in a creepy, disjointed way, where you never know whether what you are seeing is a hallucination, a nightmare, or a psychic intuition.  As a result, you feel like you are losing your mind along with Tom, who, unlike most movie characters, doesn't feel compelled to verbally explain everything he is thinking for the benefit of the audience.  You feel like you are a fly on the wall, watching this once-ordinary man's life plunge down an abyss of wild confusion and maniacal obsession.'Stir of Echoes' will initially be overlooked a bit, as the bigger marketing budget for the moron-friendly 'Stigmata', and the inevitable comparisons to 'Sixth Sense' keeps moviegoers away in its opening weekend.  But it is a better movie than either of its two current rivals (although Sixth Sense joins it in a league apart from Stigmata), and word-of-mouth will help this movie gain steam in upcoming weeks.   8.5/10 "},{"Title":"Solid & Suspenseful","Date":"13 September 1999","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Mystery, Thriller","Review":"  I hate to jump on the bandwagon and compare this flick to The Sixth Sense, but I felt this film had a better script, explored the supernatural elements more thoroughly, and was a better-constructed and better-paced movie.

Kevin deserves better, and so do we the audience.  Even so, Kevin Bacon is just about the only thing to shine in Stir Of Echoes.  Watching the story unfold gave me the feeling the producers opened up a packet of Sixth Sense and just added water.It seems the script writers knew Kevin Bacon's character having stirring visions of foul play wouldn't be enough to carry the film.  To work around this, they come up with giving Bacon's son some sort of psychic paranormal abilities (out of nowhere) which help drop hints at what's going on.  We also meet a police officer who seems to be part of a cult of psychic people. He confirms what is happening, yet his character is never really developed. It's not a lost cause however.  The direction is fine, the acting (mostly Bacon's) deserves merit, the overall quality of the film is decent. There were also some clever ideas employed which I enjoyed  Bacon's seeing everything in red, the camera work of Bacon's face morphing into that of the girl.  But the overall script's predictability remains the glaringly weak link in the chain.  It would also seem that hollywood has suddenly rediscovered the shock of having bodies or ghosts appear suddenly out of nowhere.  It's a cheap film device that has big scare payoffs.  Sixth Sense used it, Stir of Echoes uses it even more.  It would also seem that Hollywood likes to bang into our heads that when ghosts are around it gets cold, real cold.  Oh yes Sixth Sense fans, did you really think you'd seen the last of the cold breath shots?If you're a big Kevin Bacon fan you'll like his work in Stir of Echoes.  If you're going to get a few genuinely spooky gotchas, you may also be pleased.  But if you're going to see something original and not predictable, don't waste your time.

When I first saw the previews for it, I thought it looked...interesting, so I decided to go see it.  It turned out to be much better than I had expected.Stir of Echoes, written and directed by David Koepp, tells the story of a man who goes under hypnosis during a party in his neighborhood.  The effect that it had on him no one had suspected.  He starts to see visions, always very, very creepy and always having to do with the same teenage girl.  After he is led by some clues, he tries to figure out what happened to a missing teenage girl in his neighborhood, the same girl in his visions.Now, I am sure most of you all know why I would relate this to The Sixth Sense, as many people have.  It talks about a man, and his boy, who can both see ghost(s).  The ghost(s) that they can see only a small percent of people can.Now, I know everyone is wondering why I would say this film, in a way, reminded me of Pulp Fiction.  It isn't as drastic a reason as you would think.  Throughout all of Stir of Echoes, when Kevin Bacon would get all of these visions,  you just saw different things that you thought were just trying to creep the h-ll out of you, and they still did.  Also, different things happened.  At the end, it turned out that there was a reason for all of the weird visions to make sense, and when some people said something and you didn't have a clue what they were talking about, it turns out to all come together, somewhat reminiscent of Pulp Fiction, where the same thing happened different times.  Another movie like that would be Go, which I recommend.Kevin Bacon gave one of the strongest performances of his career.  He was very believable at being haunted by all that was happening to him.

Kevin Bacon plays the father in one of his best performances yet, sympathetically portraying a young blue collar worker is is horrified not just by ghosts, but by the way his life is sinking into depressing ordinariness.  The horror plot is developed a bit too slowly for a thriller, but it has some strong moments, and the denouement is thoroughly satisfying, even if it lacks the jaw-dropping climax of Sixth Sense.  The atmosphere and day-to-day details of the working class Chicago neighborhood are very well captured, especially for a genre movie.

This film is more about the father, Tom (Kevin Bacon) who has been given a post-hypnotic suggestion to open his mind more, and stop being so skeptical.  The end result of this suggestion is the awakening of psychic powers in Bacon's character. The reaction is amazing.  Tom, it appears, is one of the 8% of people who are able to achieve a significantly deep level of hypnosis, to the point where the sister is able to puncture his hand with a safety pin, and he does not bleed.  Tom is completely weirded out by the hypnosis, especially after all he can remember are momentary glimpses into something which he is unable to identify.  After awakening, he also finds himself extremely thirsty, suffering from a bad headache.He suddenly finds himself suffering from momentary hallucinations including one where a young ghost is sitting next to him on the couch, trying to tell him something.  Over the next couple of weeks, small clues come pouring in, and Tom's wife (Kathryn Erbe)  soon realizes her husband and her son share a world she knows nothing about. His obsession to know more about the ghost, and what her fate is, serves to bring a rift between him and his wife, which requires enormous patience on the part of the wife in order to keep their marriage together.To compare this film with The Sixth Sense on anything other than this superficial level is a disservice to both films.  Sixth Sense carried with it a superior wisdom--a true character film carried mainly by the two male actors, with some input by Toni Collette as Cole's mom.  Stir of Echoes, on the other hand, has a wider cast, and each of the players is like a piece of the overall puzzle which is finally almost complete by the time the last half hour of the film comes.  There are no truly shocking endings, but there are questions.  There is no answer, of course, but we think, as the audience, can only hope that things will finally work out.The emphasis is less on the child in Stir of Echoes--in this film, as I mentioned, the child is completely aware and accepting of his gift.  It is the man, emerging from a cocoon of life's gravity, and finally being able to open his eyes to all that surrounds him, who has the benefit of the epiphany of discovering talents which finally make him more than normal--a curse he thought would always be upon him.  Kevin Bacon looks tired and thin in this film and is able to convey a world-weary man who finally breaks out of his earthly perceptions in time to discover his inner self.It is a lot more gory than Sixth Sense, and a lot more shocking in places. I would not recommend it to anyone under the age of 14, especially children who don't take that kind of graphic violence well.  But adults should enjoy the film for having a decent plot, and having a lot of things going on in it.

A good looking wife, a young boy, a tough but okay job and moonlights in a rock band.  When his wife tells him that she thinks she's pregnant again (which means that he'll have to work more and probably give up the and), Bacon begins to feel that his goals in life, his attempts to do something really special, have passed him by. Later, while at a party with friends, Bacon allows his sister in law (played with a great New Age flakiness by Illyana Douglas), to hypnotize him.  While under, Bacon receives images from a dead girl who went missing six months earlier. From this point on, Bacon becomes obsessed with what the girl is trying to tell him.  He begins to feel like this is his one opportunity to do something that matters and it doesn't go down well with the wife.Koepp manages to create a neighborhood we'd all like to live in, only to peel the surface layer away to show us that evil can exist anywhere in anyone.

They are thematically very similar, but where The Sixth Sense approaches the material on tiptoe, whispering, Stir of Echoes hits you over the head with a pickaxe.Both are about a little boy who can see dead people - it's turning into a The Shining - Redux festival.  In Stir of Echoes, the little boy, Jake can see a very particular dead person, a young girl of limited mental capacity who disappeared about 6 months before.  After being hypnotized at a party, his father, played by Kevin Bacon in a stirring performance, can see her too.The look of the movie is dark and creepy from the beginning, and the director manages to maintain that feel even on brightly sunlit afternoons, as when Maggie takes Jake out for a walk in the.... cemetery?   There they meet a big, bald black man, patterned after Dick Halloran in The Shining, who immediately knows the boy has the third eye and suspects that the father must, too. We find out from him that the dead girl wants something, and that Tom will not have peace until she gets it.On cue, Tom is given his task  Dig.  The movie takes the action up a notch with more frequent appearances of the dead girl, as Tom becomes more and more obsessed with his task.  He doesn't know why he's digging, or even where he's supposed to dig, but he pursues his labors with some ardor. Meanwhile the mother, Maggie (played by Kathryn Erbe) through whose able eyes we are meant to watch this story, is getting totally creeped out.  And so are we.I have a real aversion to violence on screen (or in life), and the denouement of this movie is really over the top in that regard.Virtually every performance in this movie is superb.  The little boy (Zachary David Cope) isn't given much to do, except be cute, and rather matter-of-fact about his gift.  Kathryn Erbe is marvelous as the mother, playing the observer of this macabre drama with a perfectly credible mix of indulgence, impatience, worry, fear, and anger. Ileana Douglas does a fine turn as Maggie's sister, a witty and intelligent woman stuck in a world that is too rough for her.Kevin Bacon, rugged and blustering at first, gives us a look at a blue-collar family man who isn't used to seeing quite so much of the world around him, and is not particularly happy about it.  After he is told what part he is to play, he descends into his obsession with a gusto that seems native to a man accustomed to following someone else's orders without questioning.  He doesn't really think about what he's supposed to do, he just does it.  When he finds what he's looking for, his horror is as great as ours.If I didn't have the recent experience of the classier and more tasteful The Sixth Sense to compare it to, this movie would have fared better in my estimation.  Both movies deal with the same subject matter, but The Sixth Sense did it from the perspective of an accomplished psychologist.  It is a film of greater finesse than this gritty, working class take on the afterlife, and its themes are less about violence and retribution than about understanding.  Still, Stir of Echoes is a mighty good psychological thriller, with plenty of moments that make you jump out of your seat.

Soon thereafter, the character is besieged by a rapid succession of unsettling visions which gradually decline in intensity as the mystery unfolds.  By the climax of the film, the tension is muddled in a plot which pulls between a paranormal psychological thriller and a family drama.  What begins as a solidly atmospheric and eerie slip into the crawl space between our world and a mysterious unseen realm becomes a cliche' exhibition of obsessive behavior reminiscent of Roy Neary's gradual descent into UFO induced madness (Richard Dreyfuss in Close Encounters of the Third Kind). The climax of the film loses effect and the mystery sacrifices cohesion and believability for two reasons.  First, the viewer already suspects that the visions are leading the protagonist on a quest for understanding and justice for some horrible crime, and second because the mystery fades into an ineffective pat ending.For the most part, however, the film maintains a level of seriousness reinforced by a consistently appropriate performance by Bacon whose interactions with his wife (played by Kathryn Erbie) and young son (Zachary David Cope) are believable and their different perceptions of the circumstances wherein they are immersed are poignant and intense.  The film could have been bolstered by more exploration into what exactly the visions meant, how they fit into a larger scheme -- and the film almost does this by sending the wife on a cat and dog information-gathering quest -- but the exploration falls short of supplying any meaty insight into the supranormal melee.  The film was relatively short, and perhaps inquisitive dialogue and philosophical discussion was traded for the action of uncovering the murder mystery, but that's no excuse.  Shame on cutting a film full of the potential (promised by Richard Matheson's talented story) short.  The quest for brevity seems to be Hollywood's modern downfall.I give the film three and a quarter stars (out of four)  and highly recommend it as part of the latest trend of 1999 thrill seekers.  It's not as powerful as The Sixth Sense, which investigated the same sort of phenomena, and certainly not as scary as The Blair Witch Project, but Bacon's performance alone is worth the price of admission.

Either way, this genre has made significant money for Hollywood on the eve of the millenium, and Stir of Echoes is a worthy contender in this field.Based in the inner neighborhoods of Chicago in present time, Kevin Bacon plays the head of  amid-income family, whose values stem from working for a living, playing football, and hanging out in the neighborhood with old childhood friends.The story unfolds as our protagonist is hypnotized, and something goes terribly wrong.  Kevin is haunted in his dreams and reality by mysterious visions.  The visions will not cease, and his son is all too familiar with the scenario.As he tries to come to terms with this problem of his, side stories unfold within the neighborhood.  Not too long ago, a young girl disappeared form the neghborhood without a trace.  Are these visions associated with it?His life is turned upside down, his wife tries to unfold the mystery, and the fragile bonds of the neighborhood start to fall apart as the visions become more and more powerful.Without giving too much away...  I recall at leasst three moments where I jumped out of my seat, and had to look around to make sure I didn't make a fool out of myself!  Other moments I grimaced in awe at what was happening on screen.It's scary, it makes you think, and it worth the going rate of a flick today.

In this altered state, she convinces Kev that the movie will not embarrass him or the audience. I actually saw this before SIXTH SENSE and it spoiled the latter film for me.

Kevin Bacon is excellent here, convincingly portraying a man who's losing touch with his surroundings and is obsessed with understanding what is happening to him. Unfortunately, two-thirds into the movie, the story shifts from a supernatural thriller to a more mundane, and predictable, murder mystery.

Going under during a party, Bacon comes back haunted by feelings that a murder has occurred near him recently.  His son has the same visions and the two try to discover what happened to a neighborhood girl who disappeared years before. I understand very easily what director David Koepp is trying to do with this thriller.  Mixing equal parts Exorcist, domestic drama, and TBS original movie ham, Koepp strains to keep this mess afloat.  It's an uphill battle, but Echoes is actually quite effective in it's initial moments.  Koepp is a very seasoned screenwriter (Jurassic Park, Mission Impossible), so the man knows a thing or two about pleasing an audience. When the Bacon character begins the journey into the unknown, the film is packed to the seams with spooky atmosphere and ambitious storytelling. It's very winning to see a movie that's actually trying to creep the audience out (a proven point due to the high level of What the hell... comments during the screening I attended). It's a majestic first half, and one that sets the film up for greatness. When the action turns to Bacon and the strain his madness puts on his marriage, it's there that the film unravels completely.  What was once a creepy and effective thriller now has become a interminable bore.  The resolution of the film, involving a slow rape sequence, is sickening on two levels.  First being that simple fact that Koepp sinks to a new low by showing us the rape - very tasteful, isn't it?  The second being that the movie uses General Hospital type theatrics to get out of, what I thought was, a very complex plot .  It ends silly.  Getting there is even worse.  Koepp had something going but loses it in the closure, what accounts for this I will never know.  Based on a book, Echoes falls apart very cinematically, not like a book would.  It seems like a studio wouldn't let Koepp have his way with the entire movie. Kevin Bacon gets all the credit in the world with his acting.  He usually can be relied on to show us very different characters in each movie he does. It's a talent that many do not even try to discover. In Echoes, not much is asked of Bacon. And he returns the favor with one of his most forgettable performances.  Kathryn Erbe portrays Bacon's wife and she fares better, but in the end her character never really mattered.  Bad character actors like Kevin Dunn and Illeana Douglas round out the cast. Not the best group of performers, but this was not the best script. You decide who's at fault. Stir Of Echoes is a very forgettable thriller.  A movie that might work for people who see 2 films a year. It's always shocking to see a film break apart like this. Koepp's last film Trigger Effect was a more carefully structured movie that was far more successful with half the dramatic raw materials.  I hope Koepp can bounce back from this.  He obviously can craft a crowdpleasing film, just not one so aggressive in it's intent to please.----------- 4  "},{"Title":"Surprisingly good (just don't mention 'Sixth Sense')","Date":"14 May 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Mystery, Thriller","Review":" Stir of Echos is about a regular guy - Kevin Bacon playing an average Joe kind of guy - who, for a laugh at a party, allows himself to be hypnotised and, as a result, starts seeing dead people.

If you pretty much read any review of Stir of Echos, it almost always mentions the Sixth Sense (just like I am) because they do share a fair about of similarities.If I had to choose one, I would go for the Sixth Sense, but, don't think that Stir of Echos isn't worth a watch.

The news of his wife Maggie's (Kathryn Erbe) second pregnancy and his growing antipathy over his watchful sister-in-law Lisa (Ileanna Douglas), both fuel the anxiety inside him and set him up as a character who is ripe for drastic change. Soon after, Tom openly defies Lisa as she impresses a group of friends with talk of ghosts and of the supernatural powers of hypnotism. In an attempt to challenge her, Tom volunteers to be hypnotized, and in the process unlocks a door, which leads to more than what he ever believed in.A character that from start to finish is literally looking for something, Tom progresses from being frustrated by a mundane existence to being terrified by an unwanted ability to hear spirits' stir of echoes. This premise presents an opportunity to sensationalize the unknown, most clearly seen in the attempts to visualize the protagonist's disturbed mental states.Unfortunately, Stir of Echoes is not much more than an exercise in exploiting the common fears of the average viewer and which shows that nonconformity is a dangerous state of mind that may destroy the family unit, and should be passed over by anyone wanting to be frightened.I would watch something else if you want my opinion.

When he initially denounces her following of the occult arts, she decides to hypnotize him so she can prove it to him, yet when she's finished he begins to start acting strange. Convinced he's seeing some sort of dream or hallucinations, he launches head-first into trying to decipher the strange events and causing her to fear for his sanity. Nonplused, he continues to seek them out, and finally starting to believe he is near the true origins of the mystery, he finds himself and his family in great danger when he discovers the true secret behind the events and what lengths it will go to in order to prevent from getting out.The Good News There was some okay stuff here. One of the better ones is the few jump scares in here that actually work, most of which is during the beginning hypnotizing. This is actually quite creepy, as it's done through his viewpoint of events, and they're quite vivid and uniquely-done, while her voice is heard overlaying everything out. What makes it quite fun is that the whole scene plays out for an extended period of time, not rushing through the process and making everything important which is then completely wrapped up with the fantastic aftermath, where the results of what happened out-of-his-head are explored which makes the whole thing quite eerie and enjoyable. Other quick cuts, such as the first experiences and visions with the power aren't too bad, and a couple of them are rather nice as well. These are all used to build up the mystery, which here is really nice and doesn't take too much out of the film. The last plus here is the film's finale, which is the best part of the film overall. From the full revelation to the different fights that break out and the big wrap-up to everything, it's all quite well-done and makes this the best part of the film, as well as the film's good points.The Bad News There wasn't a whole lot really wrong with this, with the main thing being the film's big all-over flaw. For the majority of the film, the plot basically boils down to simply watching a man go inside, and that's not a very entertaining prospect at all. From initially receiving the signals to the rejection of them coming to him and then finally relenting and trying to understand everything is pretty much what the majority of the film contains, basically being the catalyst for the changeover into the second act, all the way through that and into the beginning of the third act, an astonishing amount of time devoted to an area that doesn't really doesn't do anything of much interest. That it feels the need to subjugate more scenes in here, from the antics with the son and the nights out with friends being interrupted by what's going on, aren't all the least bit frightening and come off as rather unneeded since they reek of just expanding out the film even more with scenes that might've been intended to be scares, yet fail all around. That's what makes the scenes so restless, as nothing happens yet they're played off as intended to be scary when they're not, and then the notion of a man losing his sanity does absolutely nothing as well. It's just a way to try to explain why nothing is happening, and the film just really slows to a crawl during these moments before picking up for the finale. It's too little too late, and these are the film's problems overall.The Final Verdict This is pretty much stuck in limbo, too thriller-ish for the horror crowd and not exciting enough for the thriller crowd. Still worth a look if this kind of film appeals to you or are a fan of the creative cast, but there are other, far better films out there with these same conditions to really recommend this one.Rated R Graphic Language, Violence, Nudity and a mostly-off-screen but implied rape "},{"Title":"good movie....... poorly timed release","Date":"12 August 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Horror, Mystery, Thriller","Review":" it's creepy and it's kooky, mysterious and spooky, it's altogether ooky, the stir of echos movie..............kevin bacon in top form, the talented kathryn erbe is good as the concerned mom and wife, she had evolved so much at this stage of her career since 'what about bob' and she's real easy on the eyes, the kid is cute and believable, ileana douglas is a nice addition as the strange sister in law, the plot, storyline, dialog and execution all very good. too bad it was released at the same time as 'sixth sense', which completely eclipsed it. now, so many years later, the film stands up well on its own as an interestingly well done endeavor. see it for the decent entertainment that it is, on its own merit, not as a comparison piece to 'sixth sense'.

Fact is that 'Stir Of Echoes' will disappoint you if you are a real fan of the former two movies. However, it is quite an interesting thriller, although not so thrilling as it could have been, about a man (Bacon) who gets hypnotised and starts seeing things he can't explain. His son knows where it's all about, since for some reason he has the some abilities, but Bacon doesn't understand what's happening and soon he drives himself crazy. Except for the fact that the story is far from original or creative, the thing that most disturbs you watching this flick is the fact you can't feel any sympathy for Bacon's character, since he really has an unfriendly look all the time. The boy is touching, but the makers couldn't decide whether to make his part a leading one or not, so in the end the movie floats somewhere in between, and I guess this is caused by the difficulty of turning a boring novel into a movie. With an original script this could have been a real good one, now it is just entertaining, especially towards the ending. At least the ghost of suspense should have come out and take over control. Instead, we have to make do with the ghost of clich√©.

The direction helps make this film succeed.  David Koepp does a fine job with his pacing and creating a tense, sometimes eerie atmosphere.  I particularly liked the sense of community he was able to capture as part of the setting. That is not always a very easy thing to do.  The ending is not particularly shocking in terms of not knowing what will happen but more in the unravelling of what will happen. A great difference between this film and The Sixth Sense.  I see there are some understandable comparisons to that fine film.

Troubled wife Maggie (Kathryn Erbe) looks on in horror as the man she loves becomes a reclusive loon.The script of the movie has echoes of The Sixth Sense but is different enough in it's executions that the comparison eventually becomes unfair. There's a darker, more downbeat tone here as the mystery becomes unravelled. The actual mystery is somewhat boring but the lead up is done well enough - with hints here, and there - that we're not left falling asleep ever.The direction - by David Koepp (who has a string of movies under his writing credits) - is actually decent. The colours are generally muted in tone. Sound is kept sharp. The visions Bacon receives are done intensely, with quick violent cuts and his obsession is handled well with the apparitions having a suitable menacing feel.

It features Illeana Douglas, whose work I have come to admire through the all-too-short-lived Action. I adore a good ghost story. And Richard Matheson, whose novel served as the basis for this film, is easily in the last century's top five writers in the genre. I have to admit that it started off well. The initial characterizations are very good, emphasizing the ordinariness of the characters while the staging and cinematography lead us--and Mr. Bacon's character--into a world underlying this one that is anything but ordinary. That said, while the world that only those who have the eye can see does contain some real chills (and some heartbreak), the underlying plot is old hat by now. The novel was published in 1958, and the premise has been used in countless films since then. That's not an insurmountable problem, however. The central conceit of the work was old when Matheson penned it--as is almost every other conceit in literature or film. The triumph or the downfall lies in execution. I mean, I knew whodunit and could guess why very early in the film. That doesn't have to be a problem if something else is made the focus. And what this film lacks is focus. It shifts too much among the central characters, and Kevin Bacon going over the top in his performance does not constitute giving his character that focus. Instead, it made me feel alienated from him, no small statement given that he's such a recognizable and real sort of fellow at the film's outset. I did watch it all the way through, and it wasn't a torment to do so, but I did become restless and annoyed--not the hallmarks of audience reaction to a good ghost story. I was able, however, to forgive the picture its faults until the very end, at which point . . . well, I won't include any spoilers; I will say only that the film cheats, and I can't forgive that. As an aside, I would like to comment that while some found this film misogynistic, I found it completely otherwise. The crime that is perpetrated in this film bears strong similarities to a crime committed in my area a few years ago, and I'm glad that the film conveys the brutality and horror of such an experience, made worse by the nature of the victim. The depiction of violence against women does not in itself constitute a glorification of violence against them, and in fact the film's depiction--as well as the entire script--does quite the opposite.

It was one of those movies where if you expect too much, too less is what you get.Tom Witzky (Kevin Bacon) is a blue-collar worker, a family man, the most ordinary guy in the world ... who is about to be plunged into a shattering encounter with another world. It doesn't matter if Tom doesn't believe in the supernatural, because something supernatural has started to believe in Tom. After he is hypnotised at a neighbourhood party, Tom changes. He sees things he can't explain and hears voices he can't ignore. As the horrific visions intensify, Tom realises they are pieces of a puzzle, echoes of a crime calling to be solved. But when his otherworldly nightmares begin coming true, Tom wants out. He desperately tries to rid himself of his eerie unwanted powers - only to be seized by an irresistible compulsion to dig deeper and deeper in the mystery that is consuming his life. When at last he unearths the truth, it will draw him into the long-buried secret of a ghastly crime, a vengeful spirit ... and the lethal price of laying the spirit to rest.Stir of Echoes is a throughly disappointing mess.

Slowly but surely, brief flashes of a sorrowful specter in his home turn to increasingly disturbing glimpses of the ghost's demise. Compounding his confusion are the discovery of his young son's identical proficiency and the simultaneous estrangement of his skeptical wife. Bacon impresses as the victim of his newfound ability whose once-regrettably ordinary life takes an abrupt about-face after his transformation into a receiver. Cope is equally affecting as Bacon's son whose already developed psychic aptitude is as natural for him as bouncing a ball. It is unfortunate that a few elements of the story mimic the concurrent Sixth Sense, but the facsimiles are forgivably minor. It is, however, the presence of other key plot points that make Stir Of Echoes too familiar for comfort. The blue-collar perspective is a welcome change of pace, but aside from that approach little is shown that hasn't been seen before, particularly when the payoff is all too similar to a featured sequence from 1983's memorable The Dead Zone. The faintest recall of that haunting mini-classic will immediately telegraph the climactic events of Stir Of Echoes long before Bacon begins to put the pieces together.

But, every so often, two or more films with similar plots or concepts will arrive, one on the heels of the other, strictly by coincidence of release dates.  And, more often than not, it is not quite the case of great minds thinking alike.  Remember having two volcano movies in the spring of 1997 and no fewer than three life-on-the-farm movies in 1984?  Now we have Stir of Echoes, which revolves around a young boy (and, in this case, his father as well) being able to see and communicate with dead people - and, if it hadn't been produced simultaneously with The Sixth Sense, one might naturally accuse one or the other of plagiarism.  As it is, Stir of Echoes, though not in the league with that other boxoffice smash, rates as a moderately effective, occasionally creepy and reasonably intelligent supernatural thriller.Kevin Bacon stars as a brooding, unsuccessful musician, living in Chicago with his pretty, longsuffering wife and his cute-as-a-button son who, unbeknownst to either parent, is already deep into secret communication with a dead soul.  After Bacon allows himself to undergo hypnosis at a local party, he too begins to have strange visions of a ghost plaguing the house they have just recently rented.Like so many horror films of recent times (and unlike The Sixth Sense), Stir of Echoes is more effective at creating atmosphere and mystery in the early stages than it is in maintaining suspense as the details of the plot begin to emerge.  As is often the case, the revelations are much less interesting than the enigmas they attempt to explain.  Still, Stir of Echoes provides a number of effectively eerie moments thanks to fluid direction, brooding cinematography and a moodily effective musical score.  It also, for the most part, respects the intelligence of the audience watching it.  The resolution may be a bit flatfooted, but the film provides some thrills getting there.  It doesn't stand up there with the masterpiece of the genre - 1962's Carnival of Souls - but it is good enough for these times.

Some of them were actually part of this summer's crop ( Sixth Sense, Blair Witch).  And I have to say that I would rank Blair Witch up there with ten of the most frightening films I've ever seen, and if Blair Witch is in that category, then I have to put Stir of Echoes up there with it.  This next statement is not a metaphor to prove how much this film scared me, it is not a hyperbolic statement, this is the truth, the honest to God truth.  I was sitting in the theater for the first half hour curled up in a ball.  My finger nails were shortened from my nibbling on them and my skin was a little pale from the utter fear that was washing over my body like a storm cloud enveloping the horizon.  Again, poetic words to describe a situation, but absolutely true.  Most of the films that I have seen that scared me were seen on video, but this summer I am convinced that film makers have rediscovered what it takes to scare an audience.  I am a die hard, hardcore horror movie buff/fan.  It takes alot to scare me and I can generally be a cynic when it comes to todays pathetic excuse for horror.  Take your pick and I generally hate it, from films like Urban Legend to all the Chuckie films to Idle Hands to whatever, none of them know what true horror really is.  So believe me when I tell you that the first half hour and the last twenty minutes are some of the scariest moments I have seen on film.Kevin Bacon gets hypnotized and apparently a door to a catacomb of his mind is opened and he can now see things that he shouldn't be able to.  But it is all a mystery to him because he can't understand any of it.  Then a mystery man comes into play to tell us about this awesome power that not only he has but his son as well.  This mystery man is an exact copy of Dick O'Halloran from The Shining.  Instead of calling it the SHINING, he calls it the third eye.  It doesn't matter that people will say that this borrows from Sixth Sense and Shining because this novel was written some 40 years ago, so all the ideas in here are original.  And David Koepp does a masterful job of directing.  He is more known as a writer but here I really think he studied some of the scarier horror films and not only emulated but went one step further and perfected what the camera can do to us.  The editting is also top notch as there are some quick and blurred cuts to show us what Kevin is feeling and seeing.  Especially well done is the scene where he goes under hypnosis.  And it is here that the movie takes off.  Delving into his paranoia and his reality is what makes this movie terrifying.  Even when it settles down to become a good mystery, it still moves well and keeps you interested enough to get to the rest of the scares.  Stir of Echoes is a terrifying film and if you are like me and were turned off seeing this because of the terrible trailer, take my advice and the hundreds of others that are saying that this is a great film.  I really hope people give this a chance.  If you like to be scared, then you will love this one.  If you want a summary of what this is about, then read Roger Egerts review, but if you can trust a horror buffs view, then take this opinion and run with it.  You will not be disappointed.

And it's a shame, since Stir of Echoes is a very effective, well-crafted and well-acted movie.Set in a blue-collar urban neighborhood in Chicago, we're introduced to the Witsky family and their friends. They're the type of people you'd love to know; young, stable, and, family-oriented. And they like to party. At the end of one such party Tom Witsky (Kevin Bacon) is kidding his sister-in-law (Illeana Douglas) about her New Age ways. To settle an argument he agrees to let her try and hypnotize him, and does she ever. It turns out that he's in that small percentage of the population that is very susceptible to hypnosis, and he goes way down deep. While under hypnosis a door to the 'other side' is opened, and is not entirely closed when Tom is brought back. And so begins a very creepy tale.For those that love movies like The Sixth Sense and have not seen Stir of Echoes, look no further when a fright is needed.

Although Kevin Bacon and the rest of the main cast we great also. When we finally figure out who the killer is, we are shocked. We think wow, I didn't see that one coming. Which is true, and that's what people should look for in a suspense thriller. Mystery and suspense. Unlike movies where you already know who has done what and who is bad and who is good, this movie keeps it all in up until its final thrilling moments. It was also nice to see Kevin Bacon in a movie where he is a good guy. He played a real bad guy in HOLLOW MAN, which was released after this one. Kevin Dunn was also outstanding. He really breaks himself down in this one. And there is something else that makes you like this movie, something like the eerieness and the creepiness of the atmosphere. When the opening scene comes on screen, you just know that something creepy is going to happen. And that is basically what scares you. The fact that you don't know what will happen next. JURASSIC PARK writer, David Koepp takes another great novel and brings it to the screen. I hope that he can find another book as good as this one and make that one a reality too. While I found the ending somewhat disappointing, the rest of the film is enough to make up for that. See this one if you're in the mood to be chilled....5/5.

In fact, it's the first place I ever smoked pot.Kevin Bacon is great, as is the rest of the cast. I thought his wife was portrayed by Courtney Cox and not Kathryn Erbe. I also thought his brother with the killer-son football star was Jim Belushi, and not Zachary David Cope. Apparently, the son of the co-conspirator (cop's son) was not killed by Jake Witzky (Zachary David Cope). There was only one casket at the cemetery along with the tombstone of the murdered girl whose ghost drifted off behind a moving car. The credits only showed Bacon and Cope's names. At the end of the film, aired on TWC's 'free movies,' (Sundance) the ending credits flashed by so quickly, I had to Google IMDb after the film ended just to view the cast.I don't see any comparison with 'Stir of Echoes' to 'The Sixth Sense.' This film was much more believable. The best parts were the unforgettable Chicago neighborhood, even if it wasn't Lincoln Park, and the brief shot of Kathryn Erbe's cute butt before her shower.I hope the Witzky family moved to Schaumburg, which really IS a 'decent neighborhood.' Lincoln Park is not a good family neighborhood. I'll take the suburbs any day. Besides, I'm not a Cub or Bears fan.

Kevin Bacon and his wife, Katheryn Erbe, attend a Friday night party at the house of their Chicago neighbor. Half drunk, Bacon allows himself to be hypnotized by his sister-in-law, Ileana Douglas. She induces the trace by suggesting he is alone in a dark theater with only the huge screen to look at. The blurry letters on the screen gradually develop, like a Polaroid photo, into the word SLEEP. Boy, does Kevin sleep.But after he is awakened he finds shards of strange visions are haunting him. First instantaneous and meaningless, then apparently involving an ordinary looking but rather dead young woman. The visions are annoyingly shocking, following the latest editorial fad.His son too is showing some extraordinary qualities, talking to the same young woman who is invisible to everyone else except Bacon during his seizures.Erbe and the boy meet a big, black, friendly Chicago cop who follows them around and seems to know something about what's going on. Erbe corners him and demands to know what's wrong with her husband. He's a receiver, explains the cop, like a man with a flashlight that goes on and off. The girl he's been hallucinating is a ghost and eventually she will ask him for something. And the boy? He's got a much bigger flashlight. So saying, he closes the door and isn't heard from again. In an attempt to rid himself of these ictal states, Bacon has Douglas rehypnotize him, but this time the word that appears on the screen is DIG. So Bacon starts digging -- first the back yard and then the cellar. Finally, accidentally, he bangs a hole in the wall and uncovers the mummified body of the girl in his vision.So far, so Steven King. In particular, a blend of The Shining, with Scatman Crothers as the twigged black guy, The Tommyknockers with the digging and Firestarter, in which the little girl has a much bigger flashlight than her father. Seeing the credits, realizing that the story was based on a Richard Matheson novel, cleared things up a bit. It isn't that Matheson cribbed from King, but the other way around. The Matheson story appeared earlier. And (I suppose), Poe's The Cask of Amantillado was even earlier.The first two thirds of the movie I found a little unfocused. Those nightmarish fragmented visions are as pointless to the viewer as they are to Kevin Bacon. They seem implanted in the story to provide the generic shocks that jaded fans of horror movies have become accustomed to. Clich√©s, one and all, and not very interestingly done.When, in its last act, the film turns into a story of murder and the circumstances endanger Bacon, all the supernatural business comes together and things get a lot more prosaic and a lot more interesting. A question is raised, a new question. Not, What the hell is going on?, but, Will one friend kill another in order to protect a loved one? Bacon does an efficient job. Katheryn Erbe isn't a magnetic actress but the script provides us with a shower scene from the rear in which she seems to glory in her bilateral symmetry. Their little boy is just a little boy and I don't know why he's there except to pump up our worry quotient. He should be stomped on.One of the ancillary virtues of the movie is that it does such a splendid job of capturing a working-class Chicago neighborhood without any obvious display of effort. We get to know those musty, decaying houses pretty well. We can almost smell the black soil of their back yards. And neither the Sears Tower nor The Loop appears in any of the shots.

And while Sense is probably the better film (in spite of the pretentiousness that's come out of M. Night Shyamalan since), Echoes is not entirely without interest. Kevin Bacon plays Tom Witzky, a Chicago telephone lineman who, during a neighborhood block party, allows himself to be hypnotized as a lark; but the act ultimately triggers a string of visions regarding a dark secret kept hidden by his neighbors. A screenwriter long associated with high-profile Hollywood pictures, Koepp handles his directorial duty fairly well (the last act is particularly effective); on the contrary, it's the script's loose ends (the how do I know that song segment that goes nowhere), unexplored threads (particularly the cabal of psychics, and the son's own seeming clairvoyance), and underdeveloped supporting characters that left me feeling less than fulfilled by the experience. It's as if chunks of necessary exposition went missing from the script, leaving the structure frequently disjointed. That being said, Stir of Echoes is an efficient return to the classical ghost story, the performances are admirably real, and the dream-sequences are appropriately chilling. Flaws and all, it still makes for a fine alternative to the current crop of crap wearing the banner of horror infecting multiplexes these days.

One is about a family stuck in a Haunted Hotel and the other is about a family being haunted by a Rape and Murder victim. One kid had an imaginary clairvoyant friend and could see horrible visions of the past as well as hear other people's thoughts while the other sees dead people and has premonition powers. One Mother is Docile and Enabling while the other seems to be stronger and more rationale than her husband. Still, they both are two of a kind due to the Powerful Center character known as DAD. Kevin Bacon does a fantastic portrayal of a Dad gone nuts.THE SHINING is one of my all time favorites and am glad to have been able to see this similar story in Theatres when it opened.In STIR OF ECHOES, Kevin Bacon's DAD role shines and electrifies, the rest of the plot and story fall into place beautifully and makes you wonder how much we or you really know about the supernatural world.As said in the DVD Production notes; Fred Murphy, director of photography, shot the ghostly character of Samantha at the rate of six frames per second.

I've seen it many, many times. It's so unusual to see an American film about ordinary working-class people. Without portraying them as losers. In Hollywood movies the main characters are always rich even if they're supposed to represent standard middle-class people. They always live in either huge villas or very expensive apartments in trendy areas. Another horror film I like is Session 9. It's also about working-class people and the characters are not portrayed as losers in that one either, just because they're not rich. Only realistically portrayed as ordinary, everyday people. I find this a big problem in American cinema that they almost never portray real people. People that are not extremely successful career wise nor have a huge bank account. If people in American movies are not very wealthy they're portrayed as either miserable losers or as just plain bums. Like there's no people in between living in America. What else is really refreshing about Stir Of Echoes is to see other kinds of urban American environments, that is not featuring bums, gangsters, drug addicts nor upper-class architects, Manhattan people. Fantastically realistic production design and photography. It's also unusual to see such realistically portrayed everyday people. Fantastic down to earth performances by all the actors. It's very rare to see such fine performances by actors in horror movies. I think that's another reason I'm also so found of Session 9. The script of Stir Of Echoes is very well written by David Koep. Dialog feels naturalistic and never draws attention to itself. The movie is also featuring some very good camera work and skillfully directed scenes of suspense. The commentary on the DVD by David Koep must be one of the best DVD commentaries out there. Informative and entertaining and gives great insight to how the film was made. Very much in the same class as of DVD commentaries delivered by John Carpenter. The king of commentary directors.I would also like to take the opportunity to recommend David Koeps feature film debut as a director, The Trigger Affect. Another thriller with very well drawn characters and a careful set up of story elements before the dramatic scenes of suspense sets off.

After being hypnotized Tom begins to see visions\flashbacks he cannot understand, what sends him of a journey to find out their meanings. Now as in The Sixth Sense, this movie has a great script that really keeps you interested throughout the movie. The greatest fault of this movie, in my opinion is the acting. Kevin Bacon's acting in this movie is less than second-rate, which really ruins some of the more intense scenes in the film. Larry Neumann Jr. and Kevin Dunn's acting are also sub-par, and so are some of the other side characters. In Zachary David Cope's case (who plays Bacon's son Jake), I want to say that I don't normally criticize child actors as they are usually inexperienced and it is hard to judge them fairly, but again, there's no escape from the comparison with The Sixth Sense. This is probably the greatest contrast between the two films. Considering the rather similar roles, Cope's one dimensional juvenile acting is immensely overshadowed by Haley Joel Osment excellent mature and refined acting.Try and watch this movie without referring it to the Sixth Sense, you'll find it's a pretty enjoyable movie.

In fact, it scared the hell out of me. Based on the novel A stir of echoes by Richard Matheson, the script by David Koepp is what only a gifted writer can achieve.But Koepp went backwards, if you can put it like that. With his writing talent intact, he failed in generating the necessary tension in the closed environment of Secret Window, years after this movie. But with this movie we can see the real director in Koepp; a fresh man full of interesting ideas in a film that not only deals with the mystery, but also with the psychological side of the characters.That's a thing you miss, however; and it's not so important as the gripping and unstoppable tension well handled by the director. After Tom Witzky (Kevin Bacon) is hypnotized by Lisa (Illeana Douglas), he drifts away and starts seeing things&#133;In a state of constant sleep, he feels the time has come for him to do something in his ordinary life; and he leaves his son Jake (a young and impressive Zachary David Cope) and wife Maggie (Kathryn Erbe) aside.Suddenly, Jake is filled with flashbacks he can't identify and the apparitions that become the scary moments of the ride. There's a mystery to be solved, of course; but the good thing of Stir of echoes is that it offers help for us to guess what's going on and also leaves things clear as the film begins. You will not believe it, but that help is not enough; and the movie is incredibly unpredictable.I believe this is because of two things first; the film doesn't recur to the typical 'twist' to achieve an effect (as in Secret Window) and it succeeds grandly. The other reason is Kevin Bacon's performance. The actor hardly looses focus and his little understanding of the events instantly becomes the viewer's little understanding, because he transmits it with a big amount of credibility. I'm writing something about actors without Academy Awards this week&#133;But talk about actors without nominations (Bacon).Together with James Newton Howard's precise score, Bacon is the film's best element after the script, although Douglas is very convincing as the weird Lisa and Kevin Dunn doesn't fail in the role of the caring good friend. I wonder if David Koepp will come up with a movie as good as this one again one where there's no need of a lot of blood (The Descent) to be daunting, and one where he finds the balance between his amazing writing and his fresh direction.I remember The Others; it didn't have much blood but it was completely creepy. I could honestly say about Stir of echoes that I hadn't been so frightened since The Others&#133;And Stir of echoes is older than The Others.

After Tom gets hypnotized at a party by his sister-in-law, Lisa (Illeana Douglas), he starts to experience really strange visions. He begins seeing things in red, and he has terrifying visions of a murder of a disabled girl that took place in his home. Plagued by the terrible nightmares, Tom appears to be losing his mind, but is convinced that the ghost of the murdered girl is trying to use him to solve her murder. It's up to Tom to find out what really happened to her, or she may continue to haunt him for the rest of his life.While most people compare this movie to The Sixth Sense, this movie is a lot different and a lot better in most ways, particularly that this film doesn't tack on a twist ending like The Sixth Sense did, which I thought was a little too much. The story, while it may seem slightly derivative of The Sixth Sense, is rather original and is nicely constructed, not to mention some really believable characters as well. The acting is great, Kevin Bacon was excellent as was the rest of the cast, including Erbe and Douglas. There were some really disturbing scenes in the movie, one that really freaked me out was the sudden dropping-tone of Jake's voice when he's talking to his parents, that was plain creepy. The other scene was the attack and murder of Samantha, the girl whose ghost is haunting Tom. The attack on her was extremely disturbing, mostly it was because it felt so realistic, and the fingernail shot was cringe-inducing, along with the remake of the Rolling Stone's Paint It Black blasting in the background. That scene gives me shudders to this day.Overall, Stir Of Echoes is a top-notch supernatural thriller with good performances and an excellent story.

In this dark movie, he plays very much differently to his 2 previous roles, and combining that with the role in Holow Man, is now viewed in a different light. The story is well known, but the way the story is developed is different in that it uses a obscure way of providing Bacon's character the possibility of being able to see ghosts. His son, who is struck with a similar problem, is both creepy and slightly a sad sight as he will always be troubled by such things. The wife, with the smallish role that is required, keeps up the pace and doesn't let them down. The extras, who slowly rise to the foreground and become more vital to the movie as it continues, put in a worthwhile performance and add credibility. Now I eagerly await the sequel which i hope to prove not a cash-in sequel but a worthwhile sequel.Tom Witzky is a lineman for a utility company. He's a typical working-class guy who lives in Chicago with his pregnant wife Maggie and his son Jake. Tom likes to hang out with his friends, who include Frank McCarthy and Harry Damon. One night at a party, Tom ends up in a discussion with Maggie's sister Lisa, who believes in psychic communication and the power of hypnosis. Tom challenges Lisa to hypnotise him, and she plants in him a post-hypnotic suggestion to be more open-minded...with results that were never, ever expected. That night, he sees images of violence and the ghost of Samantha Kozac, a young woman who disappeared from the neighbourhood some time ago, and is now believed to be dead. Jake also sees Samantha's ghost, but while Jake is calm about it, Tom always seems angry that the images won't stop coming. Jake's baby-sitter Debbie Kozac is Samantha's sister, who is still distraught because of Samantha's disappearance. When Debbie discovers that Jake has been talking to Samantha's ghost, Debbie becomes frantic, and she thinks Jake may know where Samantha is. Determined to figure out what's going on, Tom begins a hunt for Samantha's body, and it's a hunt that threatens to kill Tom, Maggie, and Jake, because there is someone who does not want Samantha's body to be found.

I've watched this film at least a dozen times and I never get bored with it. That's because I always find something new to grab my attention. The photography in this film is unbelievable, specifically the shot of Kevin Bacon high on a telephone pole with downtown Chicago and the three El trains in the background. Thank god the director chose to film this movie on location in Chicago and not a back lot in Hollywood. By filming A Stir of Echoes on location, the city becomes as much a part of the movie as the characters in it. What I liked most are the great performances by Kevin Bacon, Kathryn Erbe and Kevin Dunn, who play their parts so beautifully that you never ask yourself why their characters' acted the way they did. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes an intelligent horror film.

Unfortunately, whereas the latter two have a really inspiring, fascinating and completely unpredictable plot, the same cannot be said for this movie.To be fair, Stir of Echoes is not terrible; simply put, it just cannot get anything above the passable 5/10 mark. Why? Well, its main problem lies with the plot The story is about Tom Witzky (Bacon), who after a hypnosis session with his sister-in-law Lisa (Douglas), he suddenly becomes a receiver who is able to see and hear paranormal things. His son Jake (Cope) has already this gift (or curse, depending on the way you see it), and they both watch enduring and chilling visions involving a girl unknown to them. In the middle stands Tom's wife Maggie (Erbe), who although she is unable to figure out what is happening, she is stoically trying to help and restore normality to her home.Despite a good start, the plot quickly gets more and more predictable; in fact, from some point onwards things became so clear that my thrill mostly evaporated.Bacon's acting is good, while the rest of the cast manages to get satisfactory performances. Koepp makes a decent direction, but with such a predictable plot his job becomes quite difficult. All in all, the film gets a passable grade as I said previously, namely 5/10.

Mostly he is troubled by images of a young girl from the neighborhood who was rumored to have run away from home. Bacon's visions hint at a more sinister fate for the girl. The movie is well done even if the storyline is fairly predictable. (You won't need to have enhanced psychic abilities to figure out who did what.. and what they are going to do next.) At times the film's premise seems a little too close for comfort to that of The Sixth Sense (which was also released in 1999). Maybe that accounts for why a lot fewer people have seen this movie. Still, it does stand on its own merits. Certain (less effective) sequences I also found somewhat reminiscent of Close Encounters of the Third Kind. A lot of currently popular TV actors appear throughout the movie, prompting a lot of exclamations of Oh! Isn't that what's her name? From that show? Based on a book by famed horror writer Richard Matheson (who also wrote a lot of Twilight Zone and Night Gallery scripts)... so it's well worth your time.

It's just another good, strong and fairly creepy ghost story thathappened to come out around the same time as the far more popular SixthSense.  That doesn't make it a pale imitator by any means.  Stir of Echoes has  quite a bit going for it.  Blue collar worker Tom doesn't believe in the paranormal, dismissing hisspacey, New Age obsessed sister-in-law Lisa and somehow oblivious to the fact  that his son Jake frequently talks to an unseen friend in their house.  But Tom  has a rude awakening when Lisa hypnotizes him at a casual party for a jokeand plants a suggestion into his unconscious that he become more open. Suddenly, Tom is seeing things, not least of which is the stark and insistent form  of a teenage girl in his house.  When he desperately tries to turn off hisnewfound sensibilities with Lisa's assistance, things only intensify and themessage in Tom's unconscious is now crystal clear DIG.  Soon, the cellar ofTom's house is a gaping hole and the sad story of a retarded girl's final moments and the person(s) who were responsible for her demise revealthemselves to Tom's absolute horror.This is a tense thriller, filled with realistic emotions and some really great acting  by everyone, especially Ileana Douglas as the free-spirited, pot-smoking Lisa.   There are quite a few jumps and scares here, and the reveal is both horrifying  and terribly sad.  The only thing it has in common with Sixth Sense is a little  boy who can see ghosts - and that scene lasts for all of 1 minute.  Don't befooled by naysayers - this is quite a good little ghost story that deserves better  attention.

Yes, this is a ghost story, too, but it's a single ghost that is trying to contact Kevin Bacon to get him to solve a murder mystery.  While a little boy (Bacon's son) does provide the initial contact with the spirit world because of his sixth sense, he isn't the focus of the story. Bacon is very good, as are the little boy, Cope, and the smart-aleck sister-in-law, Douglas, who hypnotizes Bacon and gets the whole show going. Erbe, as the annoying and immature wife, is less successful because of the thankless role she's been given, but the other characters are fine, and the story fairly rips along with a lot of creepy and scary scenes along the way.My complaints include a few plot devices and threads that are started and then abandoned.  At first, much is made of Erbe's unexpected pregnancy and Bacon's surly I didn't expect to be this ordinary response to it, but that is all forgotten by the middle of the film.  I also thought more was going to happen with the huge black cop, who like Scatman Crothers in The Shining, senses and is drawn to Cope's gift, but his character serves only to educate Erbe about what is going on with her husband and is quickly eliminated.  It seemed like a chunk had fallen out of the plot here.  The resolution with the neighbors was a little choppy and rushed, too, with a slightly unsatisfying climax, especially concerning the suddenly homicidal landlord and his Jason-like offspring.  It seemed like the filmmakers were running out of time or money and had to cut it down and wrap it up. Overall, though, this is a keeper for ghost story nuts (I'm one myself) and anyone who enjoys a good scare or two on a dark night with the lights out.

It¬¥s an adult horror movie, and there are no teenage babes getting butchered every 10 minutes of the film. Finally after endless slasher movies the past 20 years, it seems that good classic horror movies are making a comeback. I realy enjoyed STIR OF ECHOES, even with that incredibly boring predictable ending wich almost ruins the entire story. Fortunely the atmosphere of the film is very well created and that manages to save the final result. And let¬¥s not forgget that when this story was writen that ending must have been very original and unexpected.I love the Sixth Sense and i realy liked STIR OF ECHOES despite that predictable ending, both are very good movies and both have very good classical story lines, like we haven¬¥t seen in a very long time. It¬¥s unfair to compare both movies just because they have little kids who see dead people in it. Both are very good movies in its own right. STIR OF ECHOES, has a good story, predictable but good and filled with creepy details, good acting, good scares and suspence and doesn¬¥t uses special effects to scare people. It uses atmosphere instead and this movie has a fantastic haunted one. The only reason i don¬¥t think this is as good as the Sixth Sense is only because of the lack of surprises in the plot, but other than that it¬¥s a terryfic movie for audiences who prefer their horror stories with atmosphere rather than buckets of blood, CGI special effects and cool Pop soundtracks.Please someone, make more like this. Just do it less predictable next time, and with even more chilling moments.And forgget about bad reviews, if you like serious horror movies, you will like this.

But he, at least, gives the audience the feeling that he is learning about his newfound power and that he is on the verge of understanding more about the mysterious visitor and himself.His wife's, Maggie, performance was a little more unbelievable at times; being over-emotional at times and showing no emotion at other times. Better casting could have been done in that aspect, I think.But probably the stangest and creepiest performance was by Zachery Cope, who plays Bacon's son and who can be compared to Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense even though Cope doesn't have as big a role as Osment did in Sense. His age and appearance make some of his dialogue and actions seem strange and unsettling all at once. I think for a child, he did a pretty good job at performing his part.Not quite as good as The Sixth Sense but with a strange power, a mysterious guest that keeps visiting Bacon, and a son who also has some powers Stir of Echoes is definitely an entertaining horror movie. 3.5 out of 5 stars.

Fortunately it then develops a life of its own. The horror aspects of Sixth Sense (sharp editing to portray the dead people) is perhaps even better developed - I jumped out of my seat quite audibly several times. Unfortunately it doesn't have the emotional depth of Sixth Sense, or the same degree of mystery, or the deja vu that makes you want to see the movie a second time to check your own recollection of what really happened in each scene. The suspension of disbelief is marred towards the end with real life violence as this is a slight shift of genre from the supernatural thriller we have been lulled into watching. In Sixth Sense, by comparison, the supernatural horror aspects are more frightening precisely *because* of the genre-shift from the emotionally loaded human dilemma film to unexpected horror. Having said that, Stir of Echoes turns in fine performances from Kevin Bacon and young Zachary David Cope. A well-made movie, well worth seeing, though some will judge it as not being an outstanding one.

That's not to say it's bad, it's still a perfectly good movie, it just could have been a lot better.	Bacon and Kathryn Erbe both deliver excellent performances, and have great chemistry, unfortunately the movie wasn't long enough, and they didn't have enough screen time together to harness that. Illeana Douglas is adequate, but her character isn't on the screen enough to develop into much.	'Echoes' is closer related to 'The Sixth Sense', last year's suprise megahit, in terms of plot and atmosphere than 'Stigmata' (the film's box office competition through opening weekend) is, and it almost feels like the type of movie that appears fourteen months after 'Sense' to capitalize on its success. Director David Koepp seems almost incapable of creating a mood, or any sort of suspense, and the film suffers greatly because of this.	All in all, skip it unless you're a Kevin Bacon fan, or else you're bound to be disappointed.

It is a frightening and gripping story, well presented and well crafted.  Tom Witzky (Kevin Bacon) and his wife Maggie (Kathryn Erbe) live a normal middle class life with their son Jake (Zachary David Cope) in a Chicago suburb.  Normal, that is, except for the fact that young Jake is communing with the dead.  One evening Tom dares his sister-in-law to hypnotize him to prove it is a bunch of baloney.  The result is that Tom begins to get visions of a young girl named Samantha; the same girl Jake has been talking with.  When Tom gets a message to find her, he begins an all consuming and obsessive quest.  What he finds turns out to be an evil and sinister revelation that puts him and his whole family in grave danger.The story is very effective, presented more as a psychological horror film rather than the grisly gore so prevalent in the genre.  Numerous comparisons have been made between this film and &#145;The Shining' and &#145;Close Encounters of the Third Kind', somehow implying that because this film used some of the effective devices from those films, it is without value.  I couldn't disagree more.  There is a difference between ripping off a story and adapting effective devices used in other films.  This film did the later par extraordinaire.  This story used a novel approach to a well plowed genre.  It combined the supernatural element with a mystery to produce a powerful hybrid.  Forget the comparison with &#145;Sixth Sense'.  The only thing these films had in common was dead people.   Writer/Director David Koepp did a terrific job in both capacities.  The story was plausible, frightening and drew the viewer in.  There were some dangling dead end plot lines (Maggie's pregnancy disappeared as a plot element after the announcement; and what was Neil about?) that just wasted our time. But mostly, everything fit together well.  The direction was fabulous.  It was designed to scare the hell out of you and that it did.  Koepp created incredible suspense without the use of expensive special effects, simply by using the camera and sound effectively.  The five speaker surround on the DVD was particularly good and added impact and eeriness to each scene.Kevin Bacon was at the top of his game in this film.  His obsession with finding Samantha was played with intensity and single mindedness.  Kathryn Erbe was also good as Maggie, bringing both strength and passion to the part.I rated this film a 9/10. This is an excellent thriller.  Don't miss it.

But no one can say this is an imitation, just because Echoes was released only one month after Sense. And that's why it wasn't a big success and didn't have the attention it deserved.The film tells the story of an ordinary man (Kevin Bacon) who starts to see and feel strange things (in another words, to have his mind 'open') after he is hypnotized by his sister-in-law. I'll stop right here, because I can't reveal you some secrets. All I can say is that the whole film is a big puzzle, where nonsense things start to make sense while the story goes on. So it's better to pay attention.What I really liked in Stir of Echoes was the way it is suspenseful, intriguing and creepy. It kept my attention in every moment, and I never got bored. Ok, it's not a very original film. But this mixture of The Shining and The Sixth Sense works out very well, resulting in one of the best horror films of '99, much better than the unwatchable The Blair Witch Project (which was not a horror movie, but a fake) and the so-so The Haunting. However, it doesn't come close to the sweetness and the intelligence of The Sixth Sense. But watch Stir of Echoes for the suspense, the frights, the twists.

The kind of neighborhood where block parties and barbecue's still happen. Everyone knows each other and the potential of discovering skeleton's in your next door neighbor's closet is dangerously possible. This movie portrays events of what would happen if strange things occurred to the layman. These aren't ghost busters, rich doctors, or detectives that know precisely how to handle bizarre situations. Kevin Bacon plays a telephone repair man with such realism you would expect him to leave the movie studio after filming and go back to his regular day job. But the real scene stealer is Kathryn Erbe. Her costuming, her acting, the strength and realism of her character... everything about her kept me watching with interest even though I had a fairly good idea of what was to come.We've seen this story before. The only twist is one that can be predicted if one were to think hard enough. A movie like this is an unfortunate victim to bad timing.

After a posthypnotic suggestion to have an open mind he awakens to all sorts of odd visions and experiences.  The film starts off mostly on a simple creepy note but as it progresses, Director David Koepp does a good job of making it rather scary. Using a sort of montage technique, Koepp is able to turn a rather, uncomfortable love scene between Tom and his wife, into a rather frightening, almost Poltergeist experience.  One of the most unsettling scenes is Tom's flashback into the mind of Samantha, a young girl who was raped by to neighborhood boys.  Koepp handles the scene rather well, by shooting it in a first person perspective.  The basic bottom line is that Stir of Echoes, is clearly not the best ghost story ever.

Stir of Echoes, based on the novel of the same title (save a missing A), came out the same year as The Sixth Sense, and no doubt the reason it did poorly at the box office is because of this fact. But in all truth, this film, though very predictable, has a lot of twists, and I guessed The Sixth Sense's ending long before this'un's. The ending, like many of these films, falls apart a bit and becomes quite average, but then the twists come into play and totally redeem the film.Tom Witzky (Kevin Bacon) is a telephone lineman, living in Chicago with his wife (Kathryn Erbe) and son. The neighborhood he lives in isn't exactly a bad area - everyone knows everyone, everything is out in the open. Or so it seems. Amanda's sister puts Tom into a deep hypnosis one night at a party, just for some fun, and when he snaps out of it he has become a Receiver, one who is open to everything around him. He starts seeing things, flashbacks. One character describes the flashbacks as a flashlight that switches on and off. And as the flashlight continues to flutter, Tom slowly loses his mind.A girl's ghost haunts their home. Tom's son is more of a Receiver than Tom, able to converse with the being and see it constantly. Soon Tom realizes that the ghost is trying to tell them something, trying to get them to do something. But what?Kevin Bacon gives the performance of his career here. I've never seen him channel a character so well - he's even got the gruff Chicago accent down pat. After seeing this film, I still firmly believe that Bacon would be perfect to play a werewolf, as well as Ted Danson. Just look at him - his face is just like a werewolf! Forget Wolf with Jack Nicholson - Bacon and Danson (who I really dislike as an actor) should get together and make Wolfs!, a tale about two werewolfs trying to cut it in the real world. Okay, maybe not, but seriously, he should play a werewolf sometime.The ending to Stir of Echoes didn't really blow me away, I had long guessed it (as always), but there were some small plot twists along the way that made the story much more fun to follow. Such as the feathers element. Trust me, you'll understand what I mean after you see the movie.Regarding the feathers, it took me a moment for it all to register at the end. Unlike a lot of other cheap horror/thrillers out there, Stir of Echoes does do one thing that seperates it from the ordinary - it gives its audience a chance to be an active audience, not just a lazy, sit-back-and-watch-it-unfold audience. Scenes DO unfold, but there are many other elements of the film that you must pay attention to. Stir of Echoes qualifies for a second viewing.4/5 stars -John Ulmer "},{"Title":"**** An excellent film","Date":"1 February 2000","Score":"3 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Mystery, Thriller","Review":"  Enjoy this film as a 'ghost story'.

He discovers that both he and his son are now psychics who occasionally know what's going to happen before it does.It's rather gripping in the way it unfolds, with KEVIN BACON giving a very intense performance as the blue collar worker with the macho attitude and an anger management problem that doesn't seem to disturb his sweet wife at all. She just thinks it's odd that he likes to dig up the garden with help from his cooperative little son.In fact, the only clue the girl from the other side is willing to give about why she is haunting him is the word DIG, which he sees printed on a huge theater screen. This insufficient clue is typical of what we can expect from the denouement of the tale, and leads to the cellar scene where Kevin really goes to town digging up the basement with power tools. And it's there, in the cellar, that he discovers the truth behind his visions.As stated above, there are compensations for all the things that just don't make a lot of sense. But there is no doubt that KEVIN BACON, KATHRYN ERBE and ZACHARY David COPE (as Jake, his son), all give fine performances and weave a spell that keeps you glued until the film's wrap-up scene.The finale raises more questions than answers, as is typical with this sort of story, but let's just say it's a horror tale that almost feels like something out of TALES OF THE CRYPT.But if you start thinking about it, there are enough loopholes to drive a herd of elephants through.

Having seen it again, I've got to say that I'm still not overly impressed; but the finer details have shown through, and it has to be said that director David Koepp has turned a frankly mundane story into a skilfully challenging and sinister slice of horror cinema. The attention to detail is what makes this film what it is, and by keeping the focus on the main character, Koepp is able to keep the audience enthralled for most of the way through. The director has, of course, had much more success with writing than directing, having written successful films for the likes of Steven Spielberg and Brian De Palma, and it's clear that direction isn't his strongpoint. The plot follows the common idea of hypnosis leading to a macabre discovery, as after being put under by his sister-in-law; Tom Witzky begins to hallucinate and receive messages from beyond. It would appear that hypnosis is to blame; but maybe not, as his son is seeing the same eighteen year old girl that is haunting his father...The absolute, hands down, best sequence in this movie involves a babysitter and a baby monitor; and it also sums the whole movie up. This sequence is not very original, but Koepp knows what is frightening, and in this film it feels fresh and is genuinely quite chilling. The rest of the movie is similar, as most of it has been seen in cinema many times before (some the same year with the inferior 'The Sixth Sense'), but by keeping it interesting; Koepp's screenplay succeeds. My only criticism on this front is that sometimes the plot focuses too much on just the one character, and the film can feel a little bare as the plot is overly drawn out at times. Kevin Bacon is a great actor, however, and he does very well in the lead role, as he delivers a performance that is very down to Earth despite the other-worldly nature of the plot. The way the film plays out is good as we're always left guessing, and Koepp keeps up the chills until right at the end; when he lets us down. Despite a dark and sinister atmosphere all the way through, the director sees fit to land a sloppy, sentimental climax on the end; and it really spoilt my enjoyment of it. Still, this is a nice little horror film and comes recommended.

I was scurrying back to the TV after quick bathroom and refrigerator runs so as not to miss anything. I don't do that for a movie that isn't pretty entertaining. This one is.I'm not saying, however, that it's a good movie. Good movies are the ones that demand to be watched again. As much fun as this was, once is really enough. It's doubtful that there is anything more to be learned about the human condition or even about the paranormal from repeated viewings. But I was curious about the user rating it would have here and the accompanying commentary. I'm a little surprised that more than 300 comments have been posted for such a minor piece, it's watchableness notwithstanding. As well, the opinions being expressed seem to be polarized to an extreme, often implying that the movie is utter crap but just as often citing it as excellent and underrated.Again and again it is likened to 'The Sixth Sense'. In retrospect, the producers probably should have withheld it from release after 'Sixth Sense' hit the theaters and recut it without the kid in it. The awakening of Kevin Bacon's ability to receive visions and messages from the dead as an unforeseen bi-product of having been hypnotized is sufficient enough explanation to propel the plot forward. The kid's abilities are not truly needed to make the story move. He isn't really a part of the main plot; rather, his part is a sub-plot that actually goes nowhere. Coming up with another (perhaps something that would have utilized Illeana Douglas more?) could have made the movie better. And without the kid nobody would think to compare it to 'Sixth Sense', a comparison that does not favor 'Stir Of Echoes'.A much more complex film, 'The Sixth Sense' is able to carry three major plot lines - the main plot of the boy being tormented by horrifically unwelcomed knowledge of the dead; the side plot involving the uncovering of a child's murder; and the sub-plot twist pertaining to Bruce Willis' state of being. Okay, SOME of us may have guessed early on as to the Willis thing, but I really doubt that anybody could foresee how all three plot lines would be resolved. And resolved they were, each one as convincingly as could ever be expected. Not the case with 'Stir Of Echoes'.I'd suggest to reviewers who think this is the better piece of cinema that they seriously need to re-assess the criteria by which they judge.Nevertheless, though significantly flawed, this was quite an entertaining experience. The first half implants fear by using sudden 'appearances' of a not-too-happy looking apparition. By the third or fourth jolt our jumpiness has us set up to think we may be on to some classic horror here. Additionally, these jumps follow in the wake of the well-crafted hypnotism scene. Shortly after these early sequences however, the film descends into a kind of ordinary-ness and the reprieve from tension begins to clear our minds (and our nerves). I began to wonder about something and, by the end, several somethings.A surprisingly buff Kevin Bacon almost keeps the pace from lagging with his driven-ness, semi-maniacally digging up the backyard and basement. But the son with the psychic ability is removed from the film suddenly and does not return to the screen again. It's obviously not about him.So I have questions that will probably remain unanswered forever as I'll likely not watch this again. Why was the apparition of the murdered girl so unlike her? What's with the mascara on her eyes? She didn't appear to use it in her real-life look. Why isn't the son afraid of her appearance? Is she appearing scary to Kevin Bacon but unscary to the boy? Also, she apparently carries on entire conversations with the kid but for Kevin Bacon she can only manage the word 'dig' which is rather unhelpful considering she's behind a wall, not under the ground or floor. Glasses back on, where down the street is she going at the end? What was the purpose of turning out the light when Kathryn Erbe was alone in the basement? When Kevin Bacon leaves his neighbor (Kevin Dunn) in the cellar there is a gunshot, prompting us to assume suicide. But it wasn't, so why the gunshot? What did he shoot at? And WHY did this same neighbor inform the villains of the body's discovery? So that he could (surprise!) pop up and kill them with an unexpected heroic gesture? Ultimately, a promising beginning is undone by the use of way too many clich√©s.Finally, I need to say this about the title. 'Stir Of Echoes' sounds too much like a romance novel or something. Maybe not the best title for a horror movie. Still, it made me jump a few times and I stayed with it until the end.

And I'm here to tell you, Kevin Bacon is a *FINE* actor.The material here is pretty sketchy. We have a protagonist who is an average Joe with a few aspirations which never amount to much (in an early scene, he makes a vague reference to being in a band, a plot line that strangely disappears at once), a ghost story that takes place almost entirely in a well-lit suburb (not the most haunting of circumstances), and some shoddy dialog (the supporting characters mostly seem to drink beer, swear, and watch high-school sports). The motivations are absent (why does this average Joe have a sister-in-law who is clearly an art-ees-teek hypnotherapist? Why would he let this flake experiment her technique on his brain?). The special effects and camera angles and mechanics are strictly functional (save one well-handled early scene of hypnosis, on which they apparently blew their entire SFX budget).Yet Bacon rises above all of this petty mishandling to deliver some real soul to his part. When he gets a sudden premonition about danger and tears through a crowd to follow up his instincts, you find yourself breathing hard along with him. When his wife confronts him about how his new obsessive behaviors are tearing their family apart, his rage and frustration are palpable, as his his sweetly delivered, completely nonverbal, guilty apology. It's really a remarkable performance, and worth the price of admission to an otherwise very straightforward story, one which would have been downright boring without the man's talents.Well done, Kevin.

They could easily have added another half hour to the film, and explored the ghostly possibilities, maybe a group sighting of the girl? and gone into more detail about what happened to him when he was hypnotised, and why Jake could already see the dead without being hypnotised.A very enjoyable film, worth watching, but don't take the easily spooked as they won't get to sleep tonight!NeilP.S.

I began to  wonder how this good cast got into this film. When thefilm was over, my first impression was that it was a silly attempt at horror, sort of a second-rate 6TH SENSE, to  which it must be compared and contrasted because of someglaring similarities.But as I thought about the film, I began to think thatmaybe the unintentional humor was actually intentional.Even though a murder in involved and a ghost appears  periodically, I began to get the feeling that much of what leads up to the genuinely well-done climax was much ado  about nothing. There is melerdrama which is corny  melodrama -- in other words, corny corn. There is mumbo-jumbo about x-ray eyes and typical movie versions of hypnosis that have only passing resemblance to real  hypnosis.But I guess it was the final line of dialogue in the filmthat convinced me that this is a comedy with an odd senseof humor. If I am right, I commend everyone for bringingthis off. And if I am right, the film can be viewed as aspoof of 6TH SENSE.

While at a party the talk turns to hypnosis & Tom scoffs at the idea, he goads his wife's sister Lisa (Illeana Douglas) into hypnotising him in an attempt to disprove the process. This idea backfires on Tom when Lisa does hypnotise him & while in a trance she suggests Tom should 'open his mind' to things around him which at first sounds harmless but Tom starts to see disturbing visions & hallucinations which turn out to feature a girl named Samantha (Jennifer Morrison) who mysteriously disappeared six months prior. Tom is haunted by the visions & figures out that they are some sort of message which he is determined to work out & act on...Written & directed by David Koepp this is a surprisingly good ghost film which probably is unfairly dismissed because of it's similarities to The Sixth Sense (1999) which was released only one month before Stir of Echoes. The script was based on the novel 'A Stir of Echoes' by Richard Matheson & has lots going for it, the working class environment which the film is set is very effective & gives the film a certain reality which many will be able to relate to, the film is littered with subtle shocks & jumps which actually work for once for instance the scenes when Bacon sits down on his couch & the ghost of Samantha appears next to him, the basic story is told in an engaging & gripping way with with intelligent character's you end up caring for as the strain on their relationships are portrayed & the dialogue is good too. At 100 odd minutes Stir of Echoes sounds quite a long film but while watching it last night the time flew by & in the end I actually wanted it go on longer, the film has lots of nice moments & some unexpected twists & turns which made this much, much better than I had anticipated. On the down side the ending is maybe a little so-so & it doesn't have much replay value as once you've seen the twist & turns they won't have the same impact on a second viewing.Director Koepp does a really good job here, the film could have ended up confusing & a bit of a mess but it's structured very well & makes perfect sense. While not the most action or incident packed film ever made the pace is good & it keeps moving along. This one also has a really nice, creepy atmosphere as well as a few jumpy moments. There's no gore or violence in this as it relies on good storytelling for it's impact. Stir of Echoes unfortunately did nothing at the box-office probably due to a year packed with ghost themed horror hits including the very similar The Sixth Sense, The Blair Witch Project (1999), The Haunting (1999) & Stigmata (1999) & I confess I was one who dismissed Stir of Echoes as not looking particularly inspiring, one also has to say the film doesn't have many 'moments' in it & not trailer friendly, in fact I'd have thought the films theatrical trailer would be rather dull & maybe one reason why it didn't do much at the box-office.With a modest sounding budget of about $12,000,000 this is well made, filmed in Illinois in Chicago. The acting is good by all involved although most of the cast are relatively unknown which is maybe another factor why this wasn't a big box-office draw. Even the little kid isn't that annoying & he doesn't feature that much either which is a relief.Stir of Echoes really was a surprise to me, I thought like many other's at the time it was released that it looked like another dull ghost story but while one could say it is it's a film I really liked & is very strong in every way. Followed by the made-for-TV Stir of Echoes The Homcoming (2007) which seems to have nothing to do with the original.

I'm sure others could have made a half decent film from the original source material of the book but this was an appallingly made film. Kevin Bacon is a fine actor and has made some good films but I've never seen him so bad as he was in this. The structure and direction were completely off, the script was not good at all and it just felt like a bad TV movie desperately trying to compete with proper movies like the aforementioned 'Sixth Sense'. In fact it works better if you think of it a spoof of that movie or those kind of movies.

Kevin Bacon gives a very credible performance. There are some good scares in unexpected places. As the story continues, we see him becoming increasingly overwhelmed by these visions. What could it be? They consume him and I was left feeling sad for him and his plight. Luckily for him, the son shares the same gift/curse of being able to commune with the dead. The supporting cast helps to move the story along. His wife, played by Kathrin Erbe tries to be the glue which holds the family together. Yeah, good luck with that. The pacing of the film continues to build until the key elements are finally revealed. With a gasp of relief, the story comes to an eventful conclusion.Overall, I highly recommend this film to anyone looking for something different. If you liked The Sixth Sense, you'll really enjoy this gem of a film.

The story is engulfing and tightly suspenseful. David Koepp lends some great direction that not only provides some great cold atmosphere, but a number of hypnotic elements as well. The band Gob does a great cover of the old Rolling Stones song 'Paint it Black', making a perfect theme.Kevin Bacon does one of his best performances as our troubled hero, as does Kathryn Erbe as his skeptical wife and Zachary Cope is good as his young son.Over all, an excellent mystery and a genuine bone-chiller.*** 1/2 out of **** "},{"Title":"The 3 Bad F's - Forced, flawed and forgettable.","Date":"13 November 2001","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Mystery, Thriller","Review":"  STIR OF ECHOES (1999) Rating 4/10I am a big fan of supernatural suspense thrillers, but how forced and disappointing the highly anticipated Stir of Echoes was really the only shocking thing about the film. Lets start with a few reasons why Stir of Echoes doesn't work. Well, to begin with, it had no mystery. Do we really care about what the murder case was or whatever was happening? Do we really give a crap about why Kevin Bacon keeps getting these weird 'feelings'? And finally, even if we do, it provides no really atmospheric mystery, and is a dull-looking film. Second, the movie is rarely fun or easy to watch. I'm sorry, but seeing Kevin Bacon destroy his house and look at a black screen while his wife goes mental and his Haley Joel Osment wannabe kid sees dead people is at all new or sounds even the slightest bit entertaining to you, get help. Third and finally, the movie is not memorable. I can remember no good one-liners and only the rape scene was in my head after viewing. I can't really remember what happened with all the characters, what their motives were and in general what the hell was going on all that time. You may blame my memory, but I personally think this movie was way too shallow to be memorable. Stir of Echoes is a big mistake, and I wish I could've enjoyed myself, but I really just found this movie to be nothing more than an exercise in copying other plot points. Sure, some good performances might've mildly saved the film from being a horrible disaster, but I recommend you not to waste your time. "},{"Title":"A mixed of Sixth Sense and The Shining.
