It works absolutely every time! For all I know it was filmed either at Uncle Ron's or El Matador here in town!Road House is the story of a bouncer hired to clean up a rough bar in a tiny town. He isn't just your ordinary illiterate muscle head, though. It's Patrick Swayze. He's got a degree in philosophy from NYU! He owns a Mercedes! Why, he's the best damn cooler in the business! And it's a good thing he is. This fictional town of Jasper, MO is dominated by a slimy Boss-Hogg type played by Ben Gazzara. He and his thugs skim money from every business in town, and the last thing they want is some stranger waltzing on to the scene to break up their control of the action. Enough plot, though. Let's focus on the highlights.This film has a script that should be bronzed or put on display at the Smithsonian. We get monumental lines such asIt's good to see you! spoken by a blind man when he first greets Swayze.What do you take me for? a bimbo asks another bar patron in an early scene. the reply- About a hundred dollars!And this film also contains the greatest line ever spoken in the history of cinema. Decorum prohibits me from stating it verbatim, but you'll probably know it when you hear it. It's spoken by pro wrestler Terry Funk who plays the bouncer Swayze replaces. The line focuses on the supposed size of Swayze's package, and the size vehicle his seed could fill.The film is filled with bar fights that eventually turn into shootouts, hot women, fast cars, monster trucks, explosions, you name it. Anything for guys who like movies is in abundance. The whole thing plays out like a typical night on the town for us yokels here in the red states.The film comes in surprisingly long at 114 minutes, but don't worry. This is the type of film you can basically stop at any place, then push play when you and your friends get back from the bars. It will be like you never left, as Christopher Lloyd tells Michael J. Fox at one point in Back to the Future. The film has more than its share of logical lapses. As Roger Ebert points out in his review, there is no way anyone could get as rich as Wesley by skimming this little town. It seems to only have a bar, an auto parts store, a Ford dealership, and a cafe or two. Most of these places get wiped out as the action unfolds. It makes you wonder who would have been left for Wesley to skim from. But criticism of a film like this is useless. When faced with such an artistic statement as Road House, one can either sit back and enjoy, or chuck the tape out the window. 10 of 10 stars.The genius of Joel Silver my know no boundaries.Added 9-14-2009 We'll see you on the other side, Patrick!

That legendary year saw the theatrical release of three of Hollywoods most beloved films-the Hulk Hogan opus No Holds Barred, the Sylvester Stallone masterpiece Over the Top(OK, I guess that came out in 1987,but it has a totally 1989 vibe) and our current topic of discussion, Road House.Master auteur Rowdy Herrington has taken the archetypes from ancient mythology (the hero fated to undertake an impossible task, the wise elder who guides the hero, and the villain who the hero must confront)and crafted a tale as powerful and everlasting as any of the classical myths.Dalton, the worlds greatest (or second greatest, depending on who you ask) cooler is given the Herculean task of cleaning up the Double Deuce, a honky tonk bar so vile they sweep up eyeballs with disturbing regularity. Armed with incredible tai chi skills, Dalton completes his task, but runs afoul of Brad Wesley, the evilest man in Jasper, Mo.Dalton soon realizes even his tai chi skills won't be enough to defeat the ascot sporting Wesley, or his army of monster truck driving, booze bottle smashing henchmen, so Dalton is forced to call in his mentor Wade Garrett (the world's greatest, or second greatest cooler, depending on who you ask)to help him defeat the forces of evil.Will Dalton and Wade prevail? Will Brad Wesley continue to finance his evil empire by shaking down the three businessmen that operate in Jasper? All I can tell you is this--Don't be too stupid to have a good time. Put on your right boot, hop into your monster truck and head on down to the video store and make Road House your regular Saturday night thing.

Seeing Swayze almost nude doing karate as an old Uncle Jesse looking guy watches him is just creepy. Swayze is Dalton, a guy who thinks pain doesn't hurt, a guy who can rip your throat out with his bare hands, a guy who can kick your ass and then take home Kelly Lynch and bang her the same night. Dalton is trying to clean up the Double Duce, a rough bar where the patrons aren't very friendly. The dialog is brilliant! We get lines like, I f--- guys like you in prison! The Double Douche? Come on, chicken dick! You're too stupid to have a good time. God, I love the way Don Knots makes love. The movie has tons of violence, a bar fight every 15 min. or so. Boobs flop around alot too and for the women and Shawn, Swayze shows his buns. Ben Gazzara as the bad guy chews his scenery like Adam with wings. It's a very fun film and if you don't take it too seriously, you'll enjoy it. If you liked Sense and Sensibility, you'll enjoy Road House!

The movie has its own rules and an internal structure mostly explained by the character of Dalton (Swayze), a supervisor of bouncers termed a Cooler. When certain entertainment establishments become too lowbrow and rowdy on a nightly basis, someone like Dalton is hired on to show all the patrons how to behave in a civilized manner. He has a degree in philosophy to help facilitate his instruction, plus some martial arts disciplines. In this world of bouncers, club owners, and alcohol dispensers, Dalton has a mighty rep - they've all heard of him, tho many thought he'd be bigger.Also with an older rep is Wade Garrett (Elliott), an aged cooler who shows up halfway in to help his protégé kick some teeth in. It's amusing to watch the bouncers when introduced to Wade - they react like actors introduced to the Marlon Brando of the bouncer industry. The main villain is a local rich bigshot (Gazzara), usually wearing a self-satisfied evil grin and nice clothes, hiding a repugnant nature which treasures power & more power above all else. Well, actually, he doesn't hide it much as the pic progresses. This is where such villains make a foolish error if he'd been just a little more laid-back and content with all the power he already had, things would've probably stayed the same for him. But he just can't resist having total absolute control over everything & everyone - a pure-bred fascist if ever there was - offending the zen-like sensibilities of the usually serene Dalton. Of course, having a couple of Dalton's friends killed didn't help towards a peaceful resolution.The most entertaining portions of the pic are Dalton's methods in dealing with yahoo troublemakers; these dangerous dudes are reduced to clownish oafs by Dalton's effective tactics & knowhow. There's also a dark version of Dalton, Gazzara's main henchman, a martial arts master who seems a match for Dalton's prowess. There are frequent splashes of female nudity, including by Lynch as Dalton's new girlfriend (and doctor; Dalton isn't invulnerable - he needs a doctor about twice a week). You also seem to learn a lot about the art of being a bouncer, though some of this may be baloney. In many ways, this could be the perfect guy picture.

Whether considered good or bad, it is one of the few pictures that is easy to watch all the way through by almost any one who comes across it. It is a rare gem. The phrase it's so bad that it's good doesn't apply to ROAD HOUSE. It isn't so bad it's good, it's so bad it's great. It is the very definition of a guy movie. It contains brutal and bloody fist fights, frequent nudity, a rock n' roll sound track, some of the best cheesy dialogue ever written, fancy cars, gun-play, knives being thrown, and explosions. As a movie for guys, it's a 10, as a movie to be taken seriously, it's a 5. Every attempt at drama flounders, though it never completely ruins what is going on.Although considered a box office failure when released in 1989, ROAD HOUSE quickly became a cult hit once it reached video. Finally giving in to the cult mania, MGM's new DVD version of ROAD HOUSE contains two commentaries one from director Rowdy Herrington and one by filmmakers Kevin Smith and Scott Mosier who were called in to do the track after talking ROAD HOUSE on the tenth-anniversary DVD of CLERKS. Both commentaries are fun to listen to. Herrington's commentary is for those who want to know more about the flick and the Smith/Mosier commentary is for those that want a nice laugh at the expense of this cinematic marvel. Also included on the DVD is a look-back documentary and a short featurette on the direct-to-video sequel.As an actual film 5/10 As a campy guy film 10/10 "},{"Title":"This place has a sign hangin' over the urinal that says, Don't eat the big white mint.","Date":"19 September 2009","Score":"21 out of 25 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Thriller","Review":" OK, this isn't Oscar material, it garnered six Razzie nominations instead.

Top billing here is Patrick Swayze who was in big demand at this time by Hollywood, was able to put to to good use his physical dexterity and dancing skills to to play a martial arts expert who is a head bouncer in this testosterone laden movie. There are a lot of good character actors in support, some great dialog and plenty of brawls to keep your attention.It's mostly a guy movie but it has it's chick moments although their contribution is not really very memorable,however more importantly it's a good verses evil movie! It's not a new concept there have been many similar themes over the years and the one that in many ways stands out was the 1950's western  Shane. It very much resembled this i.e. a new kid in town who stands up to the local heavy and mobilizes and encourages the terrified locals to aid him!Personally I never cared for bouncers, I used to enjoy provoking them just to see how far I could get before they got violent, also I witnessed a fight outside a club once where the bouncers themselves were badly beaten up by some thugs, therefor this movie aroused my attention. Patrick Swayze plays Dalton who has a reputation in the night club scene as a top cooler. This position is somebody who over sees the bouncers and make sure that nobody gets out of line. Although he has a degree in philosophy, Dalton uses his martial arts skills to work in the night club business and consequently gets head-hunted by a club owner from a small town in Kentucky who persuades Dalton to help him clean up a night spot called the Double Duce. The only condition Dalton insists on is that he gets well remunerated (he gets what he wants - no negotiation!) and demands cart blanche i.e. what he says goes and he has the final word!After driving down (he doesn't fly , it's too dangerous -- how ironic!) and after visiting the club he realizes that this place is a slaughterhouse that will only attract trouble makes and low-lives. He soon gets up to speed and marks the thugs and decides that some of the bouncers themselves who relish the violence are as much a part of the problem as anything else, (not at all unusual by the way). Dalton soon assets himself and starts to sort things out and get rid of the bad apples the the place starts to resemble a reasonable night spot.However, what the owner doesn't tell Dalton is that the town itself is run by a local hood and entrepreneur Brad Wesley (Ben Gazzara) aided and abetted by his hired muscle. Not only does Wesley have relatives that have been fired by Dalton but he also has designs on the club it self. Wesley soon realizes that Dalton is not some Johnny come lately and nor will not be a push over because after a couple of encounters with Dalton and his newly trained bouncers his goons come off second best.When Dalton cannot be bought off or reasoned with into joining his organization, he lets his top enforcer the intimidating Jimmy (Marshall Teague)off the leash to really crank up the pressure. Dalton realizes that he's going to need help and asks legendary cooler Wade Garret (Sam Elliot) to join him down at the Double Duce. What makes it even more complicated and really irks Wesley is that one of his former girlfriends who has not only rejected him but takes a fancy to Dalton, so Wesley tries to get to him by using his morality and good conscience against him.By intimidating the locals by destroying their businesses he hopes to turn the locals against him or else force Dalton into leave town as to save their livelihoods. Dalton does not back down and up to this point it's just gratuitous violence and intimidation, however after a show down between Jimmy and Dalton that results in a shocking conclusion, all bets are off and killing and burning down buildings are now fair game.Never the less it's great entertainment, enjoyable to watch although you shouldn't take it too seriously. Two things to point out there is not a cop to be seen in this movie until the very end, also special mention has to go to one of Wesley's henchman the hapless O'Conner who was not only twice on the receiving end of a Dalton beating but also suffered the indignity of a public dressing down and got slapped about by Wesley. This was for not measuring up to what Wesley had come to expect from his men as well as the inability to endure pain! Never the less there he is at the end still working for Wesley, the unemployment line would surly have been a better option at this stage! Well there you have it, grab the pop corn sit back and enjoy Dalton and co take out the trash and send people to barbers college!!

You get one of the most enjoyable and entertaining films of the late 80's, Road House. The film follows James Dalton (Patrick Swayze) a cooler (bouncer) and the best in the business, as he takes employment with Frank Tilghman (Kevin Tighe) the owner of the Double Deuce in Jasper, Missouri. The bar is the roughest in town and he needs Dalton to clean it up. However corrupt business man and crime boss Brad Wesley (Ben Gazzara) stands in his way. After the classic chick flick Dirty Dancing, Patrick Swayze was Hollywood gold. Women loved him and men wanted to be him. The film was full of romance. Then along came Road House, a complete opposite to Dirty Dancing, a little romance and loads of action. The film has a great cast including Patrick Swayze, Kevin Tighe, Ben Gazzara, Kelly Lynch, Marshall R. Teague, Red West, Kathleen Wilhoite, John William Young, John Doe, Kurt James Stefka, Keith David & Terry Funk. The cast works well together and it is full of great performances. Naturally Patrick Swayze at the height of his career stands miles apart from the rest of the cast as Dalton. A character that can hurt you with his words just as much as his fists. Tragically, 20 years later Swayze had his life cut short by cancer. His death is still a major loss to the entertainment industry, but his legacy will live on in the great performances and memorable characters he played. The film also a features a great performance by the late great blues guitarist Jeff Healey as Cody. It's the music in the film that goes a long way to achieving the right feel for the film. Everything works well from the characters, the music to the setting. Set in a rural area the scenery is breath-taking and it is used to great effect. But it's the fight choreography that stands out from many other films. Great bar fights are pretty much a thing of the past, but here they are full of action and humour just like the classic westerns. The one on one fights are brutal, mainly for the realism they portray. The script is awesome and full of classic lines mainly from Dalton and although many are cheesy, when he says it, it feels right. The director surprisingly hasn't made many films but the ones I have seen of his I really like and I know I am in the minority. See my review of Gladiator (1992) for more by this director. This is truly a great film, although very underrated. It is also one of my personal all-time favourites. There are a couple of versions of this so ensure that you see the USA or UK version released after 2002 as these are the uncut editions. So grab a few beers and a few friends, but this on a big screen and turn the sound way up for a really great movie experience.10 out of 10 "},{"Title":"A cheesy ball","Date":"22 November 2009","Score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Thriller","Review":" Patrick Swayze plays the best bar bouncer in the world, hired by Marshall Teague to clean up his rowdy bar, the Double Deuce.

Man, this movie is over-the-top. That is its charm. For a long time, I think it moves too slowly, but when it starts to gain momentum in the middle, it moves like a freight train. A freight train without a conductor, mind you, but, hey. Sam Elliott co-stars as Swayze's long-time partner (if you ever wanted to see Sam Elliott's graying pubes, this is the place to go).

Not necessarily. If you follow Sway's golden bouncer rules. Be nice and only fight outside the club unless it is a really serious situation. A serious situation is defined by the lord of bouncers himself. Basically, that is what Road House is about. An average action film full of flaws and a manifest ending not to be taken too seriously. Yet, if you don't watch Road House expecting too much you can still enjoy it.The very simple story is about a legendary and genuine bouncer called Dalton that tries to teach a chaotic and corrupt village, controlled by the appalling but prosperous Brad Wesley, how to behave. However, he faces big opposition and thus a lot of not so friendly bouncers wanting to foil his plans. While he only attempts to make the village a better place the pressure consistently increases until it even becomes far too personal for Dalton...Of course, there are also loads of sexy woman involved as well as roadsters and the big evil guy Dalton eventually has to fight.Though the action is decent the story lacks of pace and a red thread. Trying to combine a fairly annoying romance with the actual plot the directors fail miserably. That is arguably because Dalton is supposed to be the perfect guy proving that honest doormen do exist. Accordingly, the action never picks up the speed needed to make this film a classic. Still, as mentioned above, Road House serves its purpose Entertainment. Enjoy it if you can ;)!

But things don't go so smoothly when Dalton crosses the town's self-appointed ruler, Brad Wesley (Ben Gazzara, better known as Evil Ben Gazzara). He's paid off the Sheriff, so Evil Ben Gazzara is pretty much the town's law and order. He's not pleased with the Double Deuce's burgeoning prosperity, so he makes things tricky for Dalton. But as we learned in Dirty Dancing, nobody puts Dalton in the corner. Fifteen minutes into the film, it becomes obvious (by just the dialogue) that this is a tongue-in-cheek enterprise. Any illusions that this will be a thought-provoking story about a philosophical bouncer in a rough town go right out the window (average viewer well, this oughta be a fun ride!). Even Swayze (behind that cool stare) knows this movie is ridiculous - and that's exactly where the entertainment value kicks into high gear. Consider what this film has going for it- Swayze at his sinewy, mulleted peak- Bar fights- Monster trucks - A gaggle of shapely ladies- Steamy farmhouse sex- Sam Elliott- Shootouts- Sweaty martial arts- Male bonding that borders on homoerotic- Crackling dialogue (Do you enjoy pain? ...

Nowhere, sir! It is escapist entertainment of the highest order, in all its gratuitous violence. And let us not criticize the film's message. If you have feet and fists of fury, you CAN conquer a small town in Midwestern America. But simply putting a man through a table or a window is not enough. I would say maybe ten or fifteen should do it. I do have one beef. For a movie to feature Keith David in the opening credits, and only give that man one speaking line is morally reprehensible. But there were boobies, so I think we can let this one slide.7.5/10 "}{"Title":"Road House inspires me!!!","Date":"21 July 2004","Score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Thriller","Review":"  Makes me want to go to NYU, get my degree in Philosophy become a bouncer who knows kung fu, grease myself up, kick redneck ass and that weird oily skin guy with the hot blond and kick his ass to the beat of a blind jazz singer.

Road House is a gripping story of trying to run away from your past only to have your past thrown at you like a beer bottle smashing full-throttle towards Canadian-guitar legend Jeff Healy.The two melancholic characters, played or better said - lived - by Patrick Swayze and Kelly Lynch, seem to be in desperate need for a change in life but are in unable or uncertain on where to find it.Dalton, Patrick Swayze's person just seems to go with the flow without any particular purpose, that until a starry night a job offer arrives (re a purpose in life arrives) in the form of a bouncing job at the notorious Jasper, Wyoming nightclub, the Double Deuce.The arrival of Dalton creates a variable chain-like sense of purpose in lives of the patrons and staff of the Double Deuce. One such person is Kelly Lynch's Dr. Elizabeth Doc Clay, a big city transport (like that of Dalton) stuck in a small-town with seemingly little prospects. The two tortured souls find one another after a barroom brawl gone array and are quickly thrust into a night of passion, and a life of love. Or it would be in a perfect world. Brad Wesley (played to perfection by gravel-voiced Ben Gazzara), a big time criminal with the whole town under his belt, has already set his eyes on the beautiful Doc. Needless to say, he doesn't quite appreciate Dalton's presence in both the Double Deuce and the Doc's bedroom. It is then up to Dalton (with a little help from Bouncing Legend and mentor Wade Garrett, a role Sam Elliot was born to play) to prove to the Doc, the Double Deuce, and most importantly, to himself.There are plenty of action-packed fight scenes and steamy hot-Swayze love moments in this masterpiece, but in my view, the film as a whole is both a very sad yet uplifting movie about an outsider who finally accepts and repairs his tattered inner strength and combines it with his sheer outer power.The long shot of the Showdown at Wesley's is simply amazing, forcing you to generate your own images out of the gloom like a bespeckled Jackson Pollock canvas, one spattered with hope, dreams, desire, and love. Somehow Rowdy Herrington managed to top himself with 1993's Bruce Willis Box-Office Smash, Striking Distance. 10/10.  "},{"Title":"Outstanding Western via martial arts!

It wasn't so much that it contained the essential ingredients of fistfights, shootouts and tits (although it does, in abundance), more that is undoubtedly one of the most unintentionally hilarious camp classics of the Blockbuster era.If, as Quentin Tarantino suggests, Top Gun is the world's most homoerotic action movie, then Road House is its inbred Southern cousin. It features Patrick Swayze as Dalton, a tough, good-looking and perpetually oiled-up nightclub 'cooler' who travels from town to town like a hair-sprayed Lone Ranger. Wherever redneck hicks are afraid to drink moonshine or low-rent strippers cry out for justice, Dalton will be there. Thus he finds his way to Jasper, Missouri to get rid of the local crime boss and his number one henchman; a martial arts expert and self-proclaimed anal rapist known only as Jimmy. What follows is a curious mix of Way Of The Dragon and Deliverance, as Dalton makes the villains squeal like piggies with his down-home corn chewin' Zen wisdom, glistening pecs and slick kickboxing moves. As if that isn't enough, the soundtrack features a bunch of blues standards rocked up by the Jeff Healey Band that will delight drivers of big rigs everywhere.Owners of gun racks and monster trucks will love this movie, the rest of us will watch with a mixture of amused delight and spellbound horror.

All kidding aside, Road House is an attempt to modernise Western and Samurai themes, which leaves reality at the door. The plot focuses upon a bar in a town that appears to have a hospital, an auto dealership, a general store, and maybe a couple of houses. Apparently, a villain is skimming money out of these businesses. I don't know whether a gold mine was found in the town or not, but it would explain how a town so small that there isn't even a pharmacy would net such profits for a standover man.Patrick Swayze was an up-and-coming star, having just come out of Dirty Dancing, and I am certain he fired his agent after getting this as a follow-up. His character has a doctorate in philosophy, but works as a bouncer (this is called putting your degree to good use). He is hired by a bar owner who is literally at his wits' end. His business is failing because his clientele consists of forty-year-old adolescents, felons, power-drinkers, and trustees of modern chemistry, as Swayze puts it.Part of the blame for this lies in the people Frank, the owner, hired previously to help combat the problem. Many of them are little more than forty-year-old adolescents themselves. Right off the bat, Swayze fires several of them simply because they aren't disciplined enough for the trade. One would think that, this being the case, a man with ambitions to turn this sawdust-on-the-floor drunken barndance mill into something respectable would not have hired them in the first place.Anyway, as I previously alluded, Frank's big ambition is to glitz the place up and turn it into something a civilised man, say a brain surgeon, wouldn't be afraid or ashamed to take his family to. The problem, at least when you take into account the miniscule apparent scale of the surrounding town, is that in a scale-based economy, Frank should really be grateful for any business he gets. Swayze sets about restoring order to the locality by beating the crap out of as many thugs as he can. However, for a guy with the martial skill suggested by this film, Swayze finds himself getting injured quite a lot. One of the cardinal rules of a bar fight that he breaks very early in the film is to never turn your back to your opponent. Maybe the profession has changed a lot in fifteen years, but these days, the equivalent of a black belt in at least one martial art is supposed to be a prerequisite for the job. Most of the bouncers in this film fight more like Sid Vicious than they do Bruce Lee.Roger Ebert hits the nail on the head when he states that the houses Dalton and Walsh live in seem to be the only two in the entire town, and everything that happens in one appears to be staged for the benefit of the other. How any business, leave alone one as secondary as a bar, can survive in such a place is really beyond me. He also hits the nail right on the head when he says that Road House exists right on that invisible line that divides a good-bad film from a merely bad one. In its favour, however, is the fact that the director realized what a turkey he was making, and increased the violence quotient as much as he could in order to provide something for the viewer to be entertained by.I gave Road House a five out of ten. Normally, it would be a one out of ten, but it just has a certain kind of charm that outshines its idiocy. It makes perfect fodder for a Bad Film Night&#153;, or a drinking game. However, when you compare it to what pass for action films these days, at least it doesn't take itself so seriously.

His limited acting ability blends seamlessly with the surrounding cast with Gazzara and Elliot anchoring the movie.

Sure it's predictable and it's often over the top, but it's a romp, too, and a lot of fun.Although Dalton studied philosophy, one would go astray trying to attach a deep philosophy to the film. I would have liked, however, some closure with regard to Dalton's personal demons which supposedly devolve from a backstory episode where he had to kill in self-defense.I especially appreciated Ben Gazzara's bad guy portrayal and his come- uppance was sufficiently vengeful and of course, more than richly deserved.As usual Sam Elliot was a hoot and Kelly Lynch held up her end with humor, grace, beauty and aplomb.

It is one of the best examples of a typical eighties film. The women are ALL attractive, everyone has either facial hair, 'in your face' hair styles, or mullets, a few people get shot, and the odd few get beaten up in immensely comical ways. 'A polar bear fell on me.' Brilliant.Is the acting good? Well the plot is hardly believable, so many are critically injured, killed and whole buildings are wreaked. Yet when the authorities come in everyone says that 'I did not see nothing.' But thanks to the plot with its overly exaggerated scenes, it is one of the most watchable films I have ever watched. Once the fight scenes start, there is probably only a break of five to ten minutes between each fight scene.But for me, Swayze makes the movie. How many people did he take out with one kick? His kicking power even lead to the film being spoofed in 'Family Guy'. Which is even better. More and more people will be watching this over and over. If anyone tells you that they don't like 'Road House' kick them in the face and then rip their throat out!!

Fresh from his sensational hit, Dirty Dancing, Patrick Swayze turned to this non-stop action the following year. In Road Show Swayze plays a bouncer or cooler who comes to a Missouri town to clean up a very raunchy bar where the fist fights occur every minute with much damage.Along the way, he falls for the female doctor who treats his wounds and gets involved in the town vs. Ben Gazzara and his boys. Gazzara runs a nice protection racket for himself, and when you don't pay up, things really start to happen.The action scenes, which are very lively, are the best things this often cliché film has to offer. The ending becomes very violent and you know what the results will be.A real red-neck film in red-neck country. The Democrats will not exactly carry the day here.

Joining him are Kelly Lynch as a very sexy doctor, Sam Elliott as Dalton's teacher-mentor gives a surprisingly impressive performance as Wade Garrett, and Ben Gazzara is quite convincing as Brad Wesley.

Dalton has a look around the Double Deuce & sees nothing but the wrong sort of client, barmen who steal the takings & security men who like to have sex in the storeroom. Dalton realises he has a big job on his hands but slowly manages to turn the bar around from a rundown pit full of scum to a classy upmarket joint that people come from miles around th get inside. Tilghman is happy as his bar is making lots of money & is now respectable but local gangster Brad Wesley (Ben Gazzara) sets his sights on Dalton when he stands up to Wesley's thugs & extortion, people get beat up & things explode as Dalton takes Wesley & his goons down...Directed by Rowdy Herrington this has to be one of the gayest action films of the 80's, it's total camp from start to finish with so much unintentional humour & homosexual vibes that Road House really is one of those so bad it's good films. Lets look at the evidence. For a start whether it was intentional or not Patrick Swayze spends most of Road House without a shirt on, he swims topless, he gets treated in hospital topless, one of his final fights is topless, he trains topless (covered in sweat too), he does his Tai-Chi exercises topless, he has a row with his girlfriend topless & the list goes on & even when he isn't topless he's wearing tight fitting shirts that show off all his curves if you know what I mean. Coincidence? I think not. Also even for an action film there are too many kicks & punches to guy's groins to not arouse some suspicion that the makers were dick-lovers & really wanted to focus on male bodies & what makes them masculine. I mean all the fights in which the bad guy's grapple & hold Swayze are impossible to ignore. Road House just loves being masculine, the bar fights, the nudity, the soundtrack, the polite bouncers who can still kick ass & every attempt at serious drama just falls flat & becomes hilarious. The script takes itself very seriously but everything it does just accentuates the camp & the whole gay subtext. The dialogue is also unintentionally funny, classics like 'nobody ever wins a fight', 'pain don't hurt', 'I want you to be nice until it's time not to be nice' & 'I hears you had balls big enough to come in a dump truck' (another subtle gay reference?) will have you laughing in all the wrong places. At 110 minutes long Road House goes on longer than it should & has a sort of strange fragmented story, the first third is all about Dalton cleaning up the Double Deuce, then the middle third is about a relationship Dalton has with a Doctor & finally the Brad Wesley subplot comes to the fore during the final forty odd minutes after Dalton has turned the Double Deuces into a top night spot all on his own.For an action film there's not much action, sure the bar room brawl's are OK but hardly amazing & apart from two big explosions there's not much else. The best scene involves one of those trucks with huge wheels crashing through a car dealership & crushing all the cars as it drives over them but the sole highlight really. The whole film seems shot with bright neon colours dominating, from the bright & garish late 80's fashions to the neon signs & bright decor. The late Patrick Swayze had huge hits with Dirty Dancing (1987) & Ghost (1990) with Road House one of three films he made between them although it wasn't a big success at the time.With a supposed budget of about $19,000,000 I can now see why there aren't more big action set-pieces, there wasn't the money. Filmed in Valencia in California. The acting is bad, everyone tries to out macho each other & it's quite amusing at times watching actor's say totally gay lines of dialogue straight & try to make it sound dramatic.Road House is a camp classic, it's so bad it's good but not good for the reasons it wants to be. Sit down & just enjoy Road House for what it, a silly action film that is just plain camp & silly. Followed by the direct to video sequel Road House 2 Last Call (2006) which was going to star Swayze but he dropped out over creative differences...

However I will anyway. I don't like Patrick Swayze as an actor and never have. Until I saw 'The Beast' I just thought he was a lucky guy who had a couple of hits that were made in his comfort zone. Then I watched Road House.This is energy from start to finish and Swayze will obviously be criticised for acting this terribly. That said, could you see anyone else in that role? Or could you see Swayze playing his character any differently? No.Swayze is great and ridiculous as the meditating taichi skilled bouncer straight outta hell (not literally from hell). I've never heard of bouncers being recruited/traded, but obviously it happens because why would a movie lie? He shows up to clean up this bar in a small town and it's all fun and games until someone gets hurt. By who? The racketeering dude who 'owns the town' of course! What, you didn't know that every small town had one of those guys?Swayze gets driven to the edge and it's only the love of a good woman, and the friendship of a great cowboy (Sam Elliott, the dude from big lebowski) that can stop him going over. Anyway, an epic battle ensues and when Wesley (the bad dude) pushes Swayze over the edge we hear an epic cry WESSLLLLEEEYYYY from Swayze. Then we know...its on!Great movie which I overlooked for years because I didn't know the Swayz-Meister did any movies like this. Well he did, and by God it's one of the best 80s actioners in existence! See it, laugh at it, love it.

He is hired by Frank Tilghman Kevin Tighe to clean up his Double Deuce Road House down in Jasper, Missouri. A rough drunken and bloody place, the Double Deuce is just the start of Dalton's problems as he falls foul of town despot Brad Wesley Ben Gazzara.I don't know if it's the same the world over, but here in Britain a bouncer is very different to that of a doorman. This is something that anyone who has been in and round the profession can attest to. So even tho the casting of Swayze at first glance seemed an odd one, his character Dalton wonderfully essayed by him actually is the epitome of a doorman, where violence is the last resort and used only in extreme circumstances. All of which makes Road House an interesting film in the context of its subjects, it's only when the makers resort to cheap tricks and heavy formula that the film descends into soggy popcorn fodder.The fight scenes are competently handled here, and the characters are an engaging bunch an axis between Dalton and his landlord Emmet is particularly warm. It's also a very sexy film, mucho machismo for the lads and ladies as Swayze buffs up and kicks butt, while Kelly Lynch sets pulses raising as the perfectly toned, obligatory love interest, Doc Clay. A huge question remains tho as to if Road House means to be as cheese funny as it is? Because outside of the obvious jokes plenty there's cringe moments that make you wonder if it's comedy first, hard buttock actioner second? Be that as it may, Road House is an entertaining film regardless. Scorned by many but cherished by a lot, it remains a late 80s genre splicer that now has something of a cult following. See it at least if only for Sam Elliott's delightful turn as Wade Garrett, the cooler with a reputation as big as Jasper itself. 7/10 "},{"Title":"Good Story, Good Action!","Date":"24 March 2007","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Thriller","Review":" This is a good movie.

Kelley Lynch is the local doctor who patches up Swayze's ribs after a hard night's work and patches up his heart after a hard night's play as well.  Also after Swayze's heart is the kingpin's moll, which gives us an excuse to see a very seductive strip-tease scene where she tries to lure Swayze away from Lynch.The single best part of this movie is when, after their first date, Swayze and Lynch go back to Swayze's room and put on Otis Redding's These Arms Of Mine.  Very romantic and well done by both actors.Look for cameos and secondary roles played by famous people, such as the blind guitar player who leads the band at the pub.

Which is like in almost every scene in the movie whenever he's confronted with a drunk or unruly customer. Hired by Double Deuce owner Frank Tilghman, Kevin Tighe,to clean up the place Dalton goes to work by first firing a number of the Double Deuce crew, because they skim money from the till sell drugs and fool around with some women costumers in the store room while on a break. Which gets him put on the sh*t-list of Jasper's top mob kingpin Brad Wesley, Ben Gazzara, who's nephew Pat, John Doe, was one of those that Dalton fired.Wesley feeling that his power, as top dog in Jasper, is being threatened by Dalton gets his goons to crash into the Double Deuce and start trouble only to end up getting their heads handed to them by an angry and outraged Dalton. Dalton who seems to like his job, as a nightclub bouncer since he had 31 broken bones 2 bullet and 9 stab wounds doing it before the action in the movie Road House even started. Dalton tries at first to be the kind and sensitive type but quickly gives it up and takes to breaking heads legs and arms as well as ripping out throats. He even gets to using knives and guns on the Wesley mob by the time the movie is over. Getting friendly with Dr. Elizabeath Clay (Kelly Lynch), in one of his many visits to the hospital because of his high-pressure job, Dalton falls in love with her only to get Wesley even more mad at him since Elizabeth was once his girlfriend and even worse dropped him. With things getting out of hand with Wesley's thugs causing havoc at the Double Deuce and to the people in town who support Dalton. Like renting him an apartment and selling him spare parts for his car, which is constantly being smashed and vandalized by the Wesley Mob. Soon the legendary bouncer Wade Garrett ,Sam Elliott, a good friend of Dalton and who thought him everything that he knows about bouncing shows up in town to lend him a hand. Wesley really POed now over what's been happening in his Town Jasper starts full-scale war by almost wiping the town off the map in trying to take down Dalton. These actions end up with his whole crew of goons dead broken and buried with only him left to take on an out of control Dalton. Who's love of the humanities and being a man of peace have long abandoned him since he took the job as chief bouncer at the Double Deuce.It was hard to take Dalton seriously since you got the impression that he'll handle things at the Double Deuce with his brains, like he skillfully did at the beginning of the movie, not his fighting skills but got into to action almost as soon as the bottles and fists started flying. Were told by Wade Garrett that Dalton killed a man in Memphis over a women, his wife that Dalton was hitting on to, and that's the reason that he's so passive when it comes to using his fists. Still Dalton has no trouble at all using them, as well as guns and knives all throughout the movie killing some dozen bad guys. The ending was also a bit strange with Dalton, who just finished off the entire Wesley mob single-handed, having such a hard time with the much older, by 22 years, and out of shape, all he did in the movie was drink booze and smoke cigars, Brad Wesley that he needed a little help from his friends, four shotgun blasts, to put Wesley down for good.Of all the actors in the movie Road House Ben Gazzara seemed to enjoy himself the most , and not taking himself at all seriously,as the despicable and vicious mobster Brad Wesley. Gazzara looked like he was having the best time before the cameras since he played the alcoholic Beat Geneation poet and philosopher ,and former postal clerk, Charles Burowski in the 1981 film Tales of Ordinary Madness.

(Those who've watched this film for years will have noticed that this particular scene is missing lately when the movie runs on TV.)Anyhow...yeah, sure it's unrealistic in some rather basic ways. In an environment as dangerous as Jasper MO, Dalton's bouncer skills would have been useful for about 20 minutes, and then one of Wesley's goons would have taken him out with a few well-placed bullets. But, as so many others have pointed out, this is the stuff of fantasy, not reality, which may be part of why it's a guaranteed good time, every time.I give the film a lot of credit for being quirky enough not to just deliver the expected moves at the expected moments. Case in point is the young waitress/singer who barges into Dalton's loft on his first morning in town. Surprise though clearly staggered by his gorgeousness and mystery, she doesn't come onto him, and he doesn't try to take advantage of her. They just...chat. She's like his little sister.

On September 14, 2009 Patrick died of pancreatic cancer with his family at his side at age 57, 20 months after being diagnosed. R.I.P. Patrick Swayze (1952 - 2009) one of the best actors in Hollywood, this actor get's my respect! You will be missed! I love you! NOTE When Michael Jackson died the same year everyone was crying and put tears in his eyes but when Patrick Swayze died no one was crying for him, so I love Patrick Swayze to death! Road House (1989) this film stands alone as Patrick Swayze's best work in my opinion. It is an action classic that I grew up with it, I am a fan of Patrick Swayze and I can say it is his best action film! I love this film I grew up watching it as a kid. I have been also watching his other film Next of Kin that came the same year as this film come out. Recently watching Next of Kin the movie was never my favorite action movie, it was very boring and trough whole movie Patrick Swayze didn't do almost nothing except on the end of the film when he fought Adam Baldwin and that was it. I love Dirty Dancing the same as I love Road House, but Road House will his best film he work with it. Someday I am going to get Dirty Dancing on Blu-ray disc because of Patrick Swayze. I can say Johnny Castle and James Dalton are mine Patrick's favorite characters he ever played! My mom loved to watching him in her favorite miniseries North and South it was her favorite show that she talked about with me.Plot Dalton (Patrick Swayze) is the best bar bouncer in the business, but he's anything but typical. He's a little small for his trade, has a degree in philosophy and he believes in being nice. But when he's hired to clean up the Double Deuce in the small town of Jasper, he's pushed to his breaking point. Discovering Jasper is controlled by an evil sadist (Ben Gazzara) who doesn't want anyone meddling with his town. After he sends his goons to bust up the Double Deuce, all hell breaks loose. Now it's no more nice guy for Dalton as he starts busting heads, leading him to the all-time, no-holds-barred, butt whooping showdown of the century.There is a lot of action in this film, a lot of kickboxing and a lot's of fights in it. Patrick Swayze does a really good fight scenes, I think Patrick Swayze does really good job with a fight scenes, he does very solid job I mean really bottom in my heart I really miss Patrick Swayze I really do, that he is no longer with us. Road House is my favorite film, it has a lot of action and kickboxing fight scenes, Patrick Swayze does a really good job playing a hero for an late 80's action flick it is pretty good and I love it. It is definitely my favorite Patrick Swayze film I would say Dirty Dancing would be his second favorite film but Road House is a film that I love death and I definitely don't agree with people who doesn't like this film.You have an epic martial art's fight between Dalton (Swayze) and Jimmy (Marshall Teague) watch the fight carefully Dalton uses eagle claws technique when kills Jimmy. The choreography is a mix of various martial art styles evident in the variety of locks, throws, kicks and punches as used in Kickboxing, Hapkido and Jujitsu, with a particularly impressive flying kick from Swayze himself. The grueling work put in by the actors is visible in their strained expressions adding that no-holds-barred street fight feel to a fight scene packed with some excellent technical maneuvers.I love the beautiful music score on the end of the film When the Night Comes Falling from the Sky by The Jeff Healey Band which is very beautiful song on the end of the credits. I love the final showdown between Dalton and Wesley on the end of the movie and the happy ending.This film is directed by Rowdy Herrington who made some pretty good movies that I like, Gladiator and Striking Distance with Bruce Willis which is definitely my Bruce Willis's favorite action thriller film. The rest of the cast did also good job, Sam Elliott also did a terrific support cast, the same as actor Ben Gazzara as the villain who is sadly no longer with us anymore. Kelly Lynch was also good as Swayze's love interest. I am hearing that Nick Cassavetes is planning a remake about this film which it was unnecessary. There was a sequel about this film that I don't care for.Overall This action flick get's a 10/10 by me, I love this flick to death! Road House is a 1989 American action thriller film directed by Rowdy Herrington and starring Patrick Swayze as a bouncer at a newly refurbished roadside bar who protects a small town in Missouri from a corrupt businessman. Sam Elliott also plays a bouncer, the mentor, friend and foil of Swayze's character.

Swayze must adapt and train the local bouncer's to secure the club's respect and the safety of the community.Let me start out by saying that this review will be particularly short, but only because the film doesn't warrant anything extensive to be written about it. In fact, it's as cheesy and predictable as it gets. The plot is so straightforward it can be summed up as easily as this Swayze arrives, kicks ass, gets the girl and leaves. You're welcome. All of the characters are below underdeveloped the love interest is beyond forgettable and the villain isn't so much a villain, as he is a caricature of one. The dialogue is on the nose, the fight scenes are badly played out and it even manages to have the bad kind of 80's soundtrack.On one particularly horrible note Swayze's character has a death move in which he quickly rips out the victim's throat with his bare hand. In the final battle, Swayze resists from using this technique on Gazarra, only for the outcome to be even more implausible and ridiculous. On a general note, I will caution you to stay away. However, if you have a sort of morbid sense of fun, you just might find yourself laughing at the movie and not with it.

Full of action, character, wit, roundhouse kicks, drama, romance, roundhouse kicks, snappy dialogue, sexy performances, and more roundhouse kicks.This movie is everything you want out of a movie like this, and yet, somehow, it's the only movie that IS like this.

He's approached by another bar owner who asks him to sort out the riff-raff at his bar and turn it into a more desirable establishment. Dalton accepts the job for $500 a night and re-locates to Missouri. However, Dalton soon discovers that he has more to deal with than local riff-raff and finds that the true problems in this town exist outside of Double Deuce.What's interesting about this film at the start is that Dalton doesn't appear to be your clichéd heavy - he's an intelligent man, has a PHD in philosophy and yes he's not as 'large' as most doorman (which is a gag that is massively over-used here). His pep talk at the start is also good and acts as quite a nice frame for the film - be nice to the customer even in the face of adversity and only get nasty when you have to. This is probably a good way of dealing with people and is a good way to set the story up. I thought that the film would explore Dalton gradually re-educating the patrons of Double Deuce with a combination of education and violence, but it never really plays out this way.The problem with this film is that it's premise is a little misleading; the write up says that it's about a tough bouncer going to tame a dirty bar and whilst there are problems within the bar, the bigger problems exist outside the bar with the evil corporate tycoon Brad Wesley (Ben Gazzara). The film spends most of its running time focusing on Wesley's greed which isn't too bad to start off with, but the plot is perhaps too thin to sustain the running time. The plot is also repetitive with the bad guys showing up now and again getting their butts kicked - this perhaps wouldn't be so bad if the villains were menacing or perhaps if the fights were intense, but sadly the villains are more like caricatures and most of the fights look like they're taking place in some third-rate Western.We're then treated to the obligatory 'love interest' sub plot which was pointless and terrible. However, it did provide us with a scene where Dalton was dancing with said love interest which was off the scale bad & cheesy, but it was so bad that it was actually quite fun to watch.Road House isn't all bad and I must admit that some of the brawls were fun to watch and some of the musical numbers weren't bad. It starts out promisingly and has some good moments, but if I'm totally honest I just found the bulk of the story dull and uninteresting.

It's amazing that a film that's basically just an excuse for showing hot women and to please everyone, Patrick Swayze without his shirt, as much as possible.I will not go into the plot because I think just about everyone knows it's ridiculous. Just state that I was surprised how much graphic violence it has. I must have been drunk the first time I saw it, because the fight scenes went straight to the garbage bin of my mind at the time.Anyway, what is so attractive about this is the film's inane dialogue. There is actually a character who says I used to bleep guys like you in prison to try and intimidate Swayze's character, Dalton. It's amazing that Swayze could finish that scene with a straight face. The bloopers must be a riot to watch.There is one more reason why I like this film and that is Jeff Healey. I think this is the only time he ever tried acting and he does a really good job. His southern accent is believable even though he is from Canada and the songs are a nice mix of covers, past songs from the band and of course best of all The Doors cover. One little fault Jeff Healey normally only played lead guitar in rare instances, but here (because the songs are playback), he is able to both play the rhythm and lead guitar at the same time. I saw him live where he had the ugliest lead guitar player in history and it's a shame that they didn't include somebody to play him because I think he didn't use the same guy in all his concerts. Anyway, it was nice to see his two other regular band members get some shots in the movie.The score by Michael Kamen is pretty good, but it sounds an awful lot like the score from Lethal Weapon which has been pointed out by Oliver Harper on Retrospective Reviews.There are however major flaws with the flick that I simply can't overlook. Kelly Lynch is given the most ridiculous character to play and one of her lines comparing Dalton's character to that of the bad guy made me almost faint in disbelief. The bad guy Wesley is nicely played by Ben Gazzara by the way. I am not a huge fan of his and in many of his roles he goes overboard with his method training (the worst performance was his Al Capone), but fortunately he is very low key and has a nice moment where we see that he does have a conscience buried deep inside the character.I will not mention the director because this is definitely a Joel Silver production if ever there was one. I don't know why he feels that he has to show women who are humiliating themselves and don't get me wrong. I don't object to naked women on screen but there is one character who taunts Dalton and it's the most excruciatingly bad scene to sit through. That scene alone is why I give the film such a low rating.The ending is very cheesy. Wesley has such a stranglehold on the town that the citizens don't stand up to him. What do they do to make up for that. I won't reveal it but it is one of the more unbelievable parts of the movie, but then the whole thing ain't exactly a documentary to begin with.

OK, it's not exactly a monster or slasher flick, but it's every bit as stupid and action packed. I LOVED it!First, you've got Dalton (Patrick Swayze), a bouncer (OK, technically he's called a cooler..a guy who travels from nightclub to nightclub training bar bouncers to deal with various punks who want to cause trouble, but it really doesn't matter). At the start of the movie he's been recruited by a guy named Tilghman (Kevin Tighe) to clean up his little rat hole of a club called the Double Deuce in this equally crappy little town of Jasper, MO (supposedly outside of Kansas City..just how far outside they don't say).Not long after he arrives, Dalton sets out to rid the DD of all kinds of criminal riff raff, and in the process steps on the toes of Brad Wesley, the town kingpin (Ben Gazzara) who's been extorting every business in town and wants to keep things just as they are.Now you would think that Dalton, upon realizing that Tilghman didn't tell him the whole story about the criminal element of Jasper, would have taken his advance and high-tailed it out of that little dump of a town, right? Wrong! He's befriended some of the locals there, so he sticks around, and has confrontation after confrontation with Wesley's various goons, including his psychotic enforcer named Jimmy. It makes for some great fight scenes, with Dalton and the rest of the bouncers in his charge beating up the punks and sending them on their way (this is a guy movie to its very core). Of course all of this is predictably leading up to the final, bloody (it IS rated R) confrontation between Dalton and Wesley.OK, meanwhile Dalton falls in love with the local doctor (Kelly Lynch) who he meets when she staples together a knife wound from one of his many run-ins. You also meet Dalton's mentor and buddy, Wade Garrett (Sam Elliott in the single coolest role he's ever played). You think Dalton is cool until you meet Garrett. There's a great scene where Garrett ever-so-nonchalantly beats up four guys who were beating up on Dalton behind the DD.I could get into the stupidity of the story along with all the plot inconsistencies and how unrealistic parts of this movie are, but what would be the fun of that? You get to see guys getting beat up, Patrick Swayze and Sam Elliott being super cool while they're beating guys up, the Jeff Healey Band (the house band at the DD) playing the tunes, and a little gratuitous T&A thrown in for good measure. What more could you possibly want?If Joe Bob were reviewing this, he'd probably say 6 1/2 breasts (you only get a side shot of Kelly Lynch's). Multiple types of fu. Drive in academy award nominations going out to Marshall Teague (Jimmy) for the line (to Dalton), I used to f*** guys like you in prison! (honorable mention for his evil laugh after blowing up Dalton's landlord's house). Also, Julie Michaels (Denise, Wesley's live-in hooker) for (again, to Dalton), would you be shocked if I said let's go to my place and...f***?I think I can safely say that Joe Bob would give it four stars out of four, and recommend that you check it out!

Unfortunately, what Dalton doesn't know is that the town is totally controlled by a ruthless and sadistic man named Brad Wesley (Ben Gazzara) who has a personal interest in keeping things the way they are. Throw in the fact that Dalton has developed a romantic relationship with the woman Brad is obsessed with named Elizabeth Clay (Kelly Lynch) and it becomes clear that both he and Dalton are on a collision course and that events are about to turn ugly. Now, as far as the merits of this movie are concerned I will just say that I found it to be enjoyable--but totally ridiculous. It has lots of action, good music (provided by Jeff Healy), a couple of attractive ladies in Julie Michaels (as Denise) and the afore-mentioned Kelly Lynch, and some decent performances by Patrick Swayze and Sam Elliott (as Dalton's mentor, Wade Garrett).

He warns people before he starts, and is always nice, but this film has at least an action scene every five minutes, despite Dalton's rules.Gazzara is hilarious as the villain, and threatens the town by letting them know that if it wasn't for him, they wouldn't have a photo processing booth in the town......very sinister.The acting is corny, Sam Niell pops up just to make the film that little bit cooler, features one of the most abhorrent henchmen, ( I used to **** guys like you in prison), and if it was made today, it would be cut to shreds, because there is so much nudity going on, its unbelievable.So all in all its a funny treat.

This film is a definite reminder that the popular belief of what is beautiful is no doubt an evolving concept. The only thing more fun than watching Swayze's character dish out vigilante justice is watching his character NOT practices what he preaches. And how does someone who smokes that many cigarettes be in that kind of shape and have that much stamina? Despite its flaws, the film is incredibly entertaining, never dull and has pretty decent replay value.*** (out of four) "},{"Title":"Road House and You","Date":"19 July 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Thriller","Review":" Road House is a perfect primer for all father's to show their sons before encouraging them to leave the nest and become a man. The movie flawlessly contains hundreds of life-lessons while maintaining an outwardly appearance that it is nothing more than a simple modern day western about a not so big philosopher cleaning up a local watering hole.What can your child expect to garner from sitting down and watching Road House? Here's just a sampling of the educational opportunities contained in this cinematic powerhouse 1) Entrepreneurship &#x96; not everyone was made to be a CEO, some of us have to use the knuckle-busting philosophical skills that God and community college gave us. $5,000 down and $500 a night is an excellent start!2) Real Estate &#x96; never build your quaint farmhouse on the opposite side of the river from the town's helicopter owning psychotic. You and your horses are just asking for trouble.3) Fashion &#x96; what do you do with that old picnic tablecloth if you're a high paid doctor? Well turn it into a dress and then go down for some swill at the town's worst bar&#x85;of course. (this one's more for the ladies...but Road House plays no favorites) 4) Automobiles &#x96; all bouncers own BMW's &#x96; FACT! 5) Auto-Finance &#x96; the best day to get a loan for that new BMW is the same day the local toughs drive a monster-truck through the auto dealership. Commission and paperwork tend to be reduced in importance for a few hours so you should be driving off the lot with your new car and a low rate in no time.6) Social Etiquette &#x96; Be nice. When a guy comes at you and says, I used to &*%$ guys like you in prison! You have two options&#x85;one of them is obviously the throat rip.7) Romance &#x96; not anyone can charm a girl into a naked submissive position by delivering lines like, Oh baby, you gonna be my regular Saturday night! But with practice and patience&#x85;it'll happen.8) Ballet-Kwon-Do &#x96; a seldom practiced martial art that involves kicking and prancing with your toes straight. Fights often explode into well choreographed encounters that both inflict damage to your opponent and keep them entertained at the same time.9) Home Décor &#x96; nothing spices up a riverfront property like a room filled with stuffed safari (aka poaching) kills ranging from antelopes to lions to the various body parts of town people that didn't agree with you. The topper is always the polar bear&#x85;find yours and kill it while in your 20's to maximize the number of years of enjoyment it will bring you.10) Shotguns &#x96; the best way to return a town to peace and tranquility - the pump action.It is the civic responsibility of all people to be sure that the next generation learn these and thousands of other lessons imparted by Road House to help hone a better society.For those interested in going the more literary route, I also recommend the booksCOWARDS & BLEEDERS AND HOW TO REMOVE THEM FROM YOUR FRONT LAWN by Brad Wesley and the tourists guide to JASPER OUR TOWN AND DON'T YOU FORGET IT! by Tilghman, Stroudermire, Emmett, and Webster.

Patrick Swayze stars as tough-but-fair bouncer Dalton, who always gets the job done no matter if he's not the expected size for a man of his trade. Hell, you know the guy's something special as he's also got a degree in philosophy. Dalton's mantra is that, above all else, the bouncer should always be nice in the performance of their duties until niceness is no longer a necessity. And the person who pushes him to that point is Brad Wesley (a perfectly slimy Ben Gazzara), the kingpin of a small town named Jasper and the type who likes to own everything lock, stock and barrel. Dalton's come there at the request of a bar owner named Tilghman (Kevin Tighe), who wants his bar The Double Deuce cleaned up. By the time this is over, Dalton will have waded through one goon after another. The aptly named Rowdy Herrington is overseer of this plethora of beatings, stabbings, slashings, and shootings (not to mention explosions) guaranteed to appeal in the yahoo in many of us. There's much to enjoy, from the kick ass blues / rock soundtrack with The Jeff Healey Band performing some smoking covers. Spunky co-star Kathleen Wilhoite as barmaid Carrie Anne sings Knock on Wood along with Healey at one point. We're also treated to a delectable strip tease from super sexy Julie Michaels who plays Denise. Eternally awesome Keith David is completely wasted in an inconsequential role, but for the most part the cast is extremely impressive and full of familiar faces wrestler Terry Funk, John Doe of the group X, Marshall R. Teague as thug Jimmy who utters the immortal line I used to *beep* guys like you in prison, Joe Unger as Karpis, Tiny Ron as Mountain, Tito Larriva who also performs a rocking number to open the movie, Patricia Tallman as a bandstand babe, and Chino Fats Williams as a derelict (if you don't know that name, you'll definitely recognize the guy's voice). Kelly Lynch looks mighty fine (showing us her breasts and backside as well) as the doctor turned on by the new guy in town, and Sam Elliott is just a total pleasure to watch as Dalton's older and wiser buddy. Road House, overall, is just too much damn fun to resist, offering undemanding thrills and delivering healthy laughs (whether they're intended or not); one goon is left to leave the movie on a high note by describing how he was incapacitated by having a stuffed polar bear dropped on him. Yup, you read that right. Take my advice and see this movie with buddies & beers; it's a total hoot for its whole 114 minute running time. Eight out of 10.

Stir up any trouble on Wade's watch and you're bound for the floor, writhing in pain with an overextended kneecap and pair of bruised testicles. But Wade is getting old now, and it's up to his young protégé Dalton (Patrick Swayze) to carry the torch and keep on taking out the trash in small town America. Don't let his mullet fool you, or all the scars from knife wounds -- Dalton has a degree in philosophy from NYU. And even though he's unusually small in stature, Dalton knows Tai Chi, and he's mastered the art of tearing a man's throat out -- using only his bare hands.Dalton's just been hand-picked to take on a special job at the Double Deuce, a little watering hole down in Jasper, Missouri where all the bullies seem to be flocking to make a clubhouse for themselves and harass the local patrons. As Dalton puts it, People who really want to have a good time won't come to a slaughterhouse. And the Deuce is fast becoming just that, chock full of 40-year-old adolescents, felons, power-drinkers and trustees of modern chemistry. With all their shenanigans backed by the muscle of a ruthless and power-hungry business tycoon named Wesley -- the self-designated town chieftain who rules over Jasper with an iron fist and has all the local policemen reaching into his pocketbook for kickbacks -- Dalton's task of washing out the sewer scum at the Double Deuce is proving to be a challenge like none he's ever seen.The reputation of the Double Deuce is spiraling down the toilet bowl, and fast. But not if Dalton has anything to say about it. He's here to impart several important kernels of wisdom on all the workers at the Deuce, to forge a team of elite bouncers like none the country has ever seen. Dalton explains that to be the best, all you have to do is follow three simple rules. Number one, keep on the lookout. Number two, flush out the trouble makers. And number three, as a general rule of thumb Just be nice...until it's time to not be nice.Take it from the man who makes love standing upright, with all his clothes on. But it's going to take more than smooth moves and a degree in philosophy to wash out all the scum at the Double Deuce. He's going to have to summon all of Wade Garrett's lessons and then some, to take care of one final bouncing task he's going head to head with Wesley himself for the ultimate no-holds-barred showdown. It's a clash of two titans who have nothing to lose but their lives, and in the end only one man is left standing up.

I did not expect to see him so nicotine addicted he could hardly put down his cigarette to whoop ass. I thought he was trying to emulate the old Bogart technique of covering his acting deficiencies by distracting his audience with his incessant smoking.I enjoyed his effort at playing the hired gun with some success. Of course, the villain 'Brad Wesley' could have easily ended his threat by dispatching his tame police force to arrest 'Dalton' on any convenient charge.There was a moment of deliberate mockery of his previous role in 'Dirty Dancing'. The Otis Redding tune 'These Arms of Mine' played during his love scene with Kelly Lynch just as in one of his love scenes in 'Dirty Dancing'. The sex was far more explicit and raw in this outing. I suppose part of that was due to his love interest in 'Dirty Dancing' was supposed to be 17 years old and a virgin as opposed to a mature divorced woman in this film. Swayze would not have been seen as sympathetic while taking blatant advantage of a young girl. Here, he could act more freely.'Doctor Clay' must have been trying to p*** off 'Brad Wesley' in the movie. She flaunted her tryst with 'Dalton' on the balcony of the barn in maximum lighting. He could hardly fail to notice what they were doing right on his doorstep. Knowing Wesley well, she should have realized her actions could have provoked him into killing Dalton and perhaps herself as well. Surely, 'Dalton' would have picked up on this aspect with his keen Zen sensitivity and toned down his challenge by turning out the lights.Something bothered me about the bar owner 'Frank Tilghman'(Kevin Tighe). I realized I knew him from somewhere. It finally came to me. He was 'Roy DeSoto' on the old 'Emergency' TV show. He had aged a great deal since the TV show went off the air roughly 10 years before the film.Reading comments on this film from overseas leads me to wonder if such establishments as the Double Deuce exist in other countries? There seems to be some sort of hideous attraction to this film from these quarters. The people enjoy the film, then draw back in horror at how the crude lower classes in America behave in their leisure hours. O well, the Hell's Angels have found appeal in certain European countries; why not the corresponding redneck bars to fight and drink in?In conclusion, this was a partly successful effort by Patrick Swayze to break out of his 'Dirty Dancing' typecasting. He had enough sense to turn down the $6 million offered to do a sequel to 'Dirty Dancing'. The over-the-top plot was fairly effective in allowing him to try for other roles. He did another chick flick in 'Ghost', but it was different enough to keep him in demand for the next few years. Swayze is one of those perennial performers who always seem to be able to keep themselves in the public eye. I watch this film at least once a month to enjoy the guilty pleasure of the king of the trashy movies.

But he is no ordinary bouncer. He is to bouncing what Frank Sidebottom was to papier-mâché headed stand-up comedy. He's the best. A rowdy bar needs someone to control it. Swayze is the man with the plan and he comes into town and tames the joint via a mixture of even more fighting and general smugness. His main philosophy is to 'be nice' to rowdy patrons. In practise I only really noticed him punching a lot of people in the face but I guess everything is relative.The road house in question is a spectacularly violent place where physical assaults happen on a seemingly minute-by-minute basis. The entertainment is provided by a blues band consisting of a blind man playing a guitar on his lap and two men with tight-perms in the rhythm section. Unfortunately there is some chicken wire between them and the flying bottles. I think all-in-all if you ended up going to this place on a night out it would be only fair to surmise that your night must have peaked already.Needless to say a film such as this would not function without some villains. We have a local crime boss - who is even smugger than Swayze &#x96; and his gang of boneheads. This borderline autistic group of henchmen range from a hideously overweight cretin to an evil martial arts expert with a prison-gay attitude. Some people might find this character mildly homophobic but to be perfectly honest Road House is, if anything, loaded with homo-erotic moments alongside its copious female nudity &#x96; Swayze seems to be half-naked almost the whole time.

What we're watching is nothing more than a western where karate is substituted for six guns. Among some other of his accomplishments Patrick Swayze as Dalton went to NYU where he majored in philosophy. Most likely of the Oriental variety given his prowess in the martial arts. He's a man of a few more words than David Carradine, but the old Kung Fu series might also have inspired this film. Swayze's a hired gun and in this case the guy who does the hiring is Kevin Tighe, owner of the Double Deuce Road House is Jasper, Missouri. The place has a bad name with a real bad element frequenting it. He's to clean it up.But in Jasper, Missouri the real bad element is Ben Gazzara who's just like every town boss in the old west. He's got the old protection racket working beautifully there with all the business owners kicking in 10% to him. He's also got his own gunfighter so to speak in the person of Marshall Teague who's sure he's better at martial arts than Swayze.Gazzara looks like he's enjoying swaggering through the town and the film, his performance is the best thing about Road House. It's strictly ham with a lot of relish. Two other major characters are here in roles perfectly suited to them. As Swayze's mentor in the bouncing business is Sam Elliot who if these guys were Oriental, Swayze would be calling him 'grasshopper'. And there's Kelly Lynch as a lady doctor who gets patch Patrick up. At one time she had a thing going with Gazzara, but the man's sadism and general meanness made her reevaluate the relationship.After I was through watching Road House again it hit me as to which film this seem to pattern on. Check out the Dean Martin-Jean Simmons- George Peppard film from the Sixties, Rough Night In Jericho. Of course I liked that one a whole lot better because it was a western and not a neo-western.Still Road House has its moments for action fans.

This is typical Swayze; the brooding loner who defends the rights of the less fortunate all while scoring with hot chicks in an effort to blur our curiosities about his sexuality. In all fairness to him as a human being, Patrick Swayze does come across as a decent guy which is saying something considering the wackos that inhabit the movie industry. My mom absolutely LOVES the guys acting (especially the scenes in which he holds back tears) so maybe the criticism stems from us being jealous. Who knows? This film does have some classic lines but even more powerful are the artistic nuances of Swayze's fight scenes. My girlfriend and I nearly laugh our bladders empty at some of his flying leaps and cosmetically perfect kicks. If a guy kicked my ass doing that kind of stuff, I would retire my gender. Swayze is the number one bouncer in the county (if you think realistically) or maybe the world (if you want to feel more of an impact who gets hired by some guy to run his bar. He shows up, cleans up, meets a hot doctor, reunites with his mentor, performs tai chi in chest-high, moose-knuckled sweatpants to the dribbling delight of an all-too interested old prospector looking type and eventually saves the day.

It is   a long violent, pointless film; its purpose is to distract rather than   comment or create. At the start of the film, we meet Dalton (Patrick   Swayze), a renowned bouncer who has taken a job to clean up a local   Texas dive, the Double Deuce. Dalton is a deeply spiritual man, who has   a degree in philosophy (Um, man's search for faith, that   sorta...s***) and a heart of gold. After a tough night, Dalton finds   himself getting stitches from an attractive blond doctor. Later, when she shows up at the Double Deuce (in a dress that   makes her look like a picnic table), Dalton drives her home, and well,   you know. Meanwhile, our hero has become the target for the wrath of   the local eccentric psychopath, Brad Wesley (Ben Gazzara), who drives   around in a monster truck blowing things up. As Wesley's attacks become   more personal, Dalton is forced into many fight scenes that go on for   too long. As tensions mount a final showdown plays out, and only one   man will be left standing.    There is few innovations in ROAD HOUSE, every character fits nicely   into the formula of the genre. Dalton, is the stoic gunslinger who   comes to town and ends up saving it. Another good example is the   chthonian character of Wesley, who, you'll notice, never works, just   scowls and abuses the help. Denise (Julie Michaels), exists for the   sole reason of wearing tight dresses and eventually bares her breasts   to everyone in the bar (on this point, I have no specific contention).   Jeff Healy acts as a kind of Greek chorus who supplies revelatory   details as the plot demands. The only interesting character is Wade   Garrett, Dalton's mentor and friend, who shows up for no apparent   reason. Sam Elliott plays Garrett as a tough guy past his prime, he   fights while favoring his bad leg, and gives the sense that ten years   ago he was the toughest guy around. The audience connects with Garrett,   more than Dalton, and I can't help but wonder how much better ROAD   HOUSE would be if it were about him.    Rowdy Herrington directs this picture with all the deftness of a   fourteen year old boy. It's all about breasts and monster trucks, but   he does not realize that those elements can play a part in a plausible   narrative. The film is cheesy and poorly paced, even small moments of   entertainment are lost in the unpleasant events of the film. The fight   scene between Swayze and the local churl Jimmy (Marshall Teague), near   the end of the film, is more concerned with the detailed choreography   than with the conflict between the two characters. It goes on for far   too long and fails to capture that spark that makes you shadow box   along with it. It simply goes through the motions. In fact very little   connects in ROAD HOUSE, and by the ridiculous ending I had stopped   caring about any of it. 3/10.    By the way, how does one become a renowned bouncer? Is there a annual   convention in Munich or something I don't know about.

That's about it, unless you count a bit of half-assed philosophising and a couple of steamy sex scenes. For nearly two hours we are asked to sit back and enjoy folks getting stabbed, shot, head-butted, struck with bottles, struck with pool cues, throats torn out, eyes blackened, heads smashed against tables, and so on and so on. It's fun for about twenty minutes, but the overall effect is weakened through sheer repetition. I guess if there's a moral that the film-makers need to take away from this movie, then it's that when the audience has seen a couple of beatings, there's no need to subject them to a further forty!!!Dalton (Patrick Swayze) is a super-tough bouncer &#150; known in the trade as a cooler &#150; who specialises in turning violent, lawless bars into sophisticated night-spots. He is offered a phenomenal wage if he can transform a run-down Kansas hell-hole, named the Double Deuce, into a more civilised, respectable kind of place. Dalton visits the Double Deuce to find out what he's letting himself in for, and finds it every bit as rough and tough as anywhere he's ever worked. Within a few weeks, though, he starts to get the joint's reputation sorted out &#150; firing the incompetents, coaching those that show potential, and maintaining strict discipline amongst the drinkers who frequent the place. He even gets a girlfriend in the shape of local nurse Elizabeth Clay (Kelly Lynch). It's not all smooth sailing, however, as the town's resident crime lord Brad Wesley (Ben Gazzara) starts to get irritated by Dalton's successful attempts to clean up the town and the Double Deuce. Seems Wesley preferred it as it was. Various thugs and hired hands try to drive Dalton away, and their campaign against him slowly starts to wear him down. Dalton calls his friend Wade Garrett (Sam Elliott) &#150; the ultimate bouncer, and the guy who taught Dalton every trick in the book &#150; and together they stand up against Wesley's reign of fear.There's really very little to say about Road House. It has mindless action for those who crave such things; some of the dialogue is curiously quotable; and its choreographed fist-fights are every bit as brutal as they're supposed to be. Director Rowdy Herrington (an apt name, if ever there was one!!!) knows exactly which target audience he's trying to satisfy, and he gives them what they want. The film is photographed efficiently but nothing more, and Michael Kamen underscores the proceedings with simple but suitable music. Performance-wise, hardly anyone bothers to shift out of first gear. Swayze poses and pouts, Gazzara smiles jovially even when being threatened (that's the writer's way of demonstrating what a bad-ass he is!), Elliot delivers juicy lines with snarling relish, and Lynch basically stands around looking vacant but sexy. It's unlikely that anyone will be glancing at their watch every five minutes wishing that Road House will hurry up and finish. At the very least, one can appreciate it on the level of entertaining trash. Then again, you won't exactly come away from the film feeling bowled over by the sheer cinematic genius of it all. A Friday night no-brainer &#150; yes. A film of lasting significance and high art &#150; no.

He is an actor with little range, and doesn't seem to change a whole lot from picture to picture. As Dalton, the hired bouncer for the Double Deuce, he doesn't register any emotion, whether in his fighting scenes, or in his romantic ones. Unfortunately, he doesn't seem believable in his role.The story line is fake from beginning to end. It kept reminding us of a Western in which the fed up citizens of Jasper hire Dalton to get rid of the man that owns the town, the evil Brad Wesley. This evil man has surrounded himself with a posse of heavies to abuse everyone in town. Since controls everything, he feels threatened when the hunky Dalton arrives. Even one of Wesley's goons tells Dalton, while they are fighting, he would be one of the men he had sex with in jail!Road House is the kind of film to have at hand when a whole bunch of friends arrive and want to have fun watching a movie because inevitably, it will create a fun atmosphere.

That doesn't stop me watching it repeatedly, however, since it's also one of the most unintentionally hilarious movies ever made, right up there with Showgirls, although this turkey makes Showgirls seem positively knowing by comparison.What's wrong with it? So much, and some of the problems run right to the core. And at that core is Patrick Swayze grinning and working out whilst trying to read an upside-down copy of Sun Tzu's Art of War.Let's examine the script, which is appalling. Every Swayze retort or one-liner is brainless, and yet people react as if he's some kind of invincible cross between the Hulk and Tennyson. As an example, Swayze is giving a speech whereby he asks his charges to Just be nice to the punters in all cases, no matter how vile they are. One of the bouncers asks What if someone calls my mother a whore? to which Swayze quips Is she?. Well, that certainly put him in his place, and the poor thug is left speechless.Along with his incredible wit, Swayze (make no mistake, he's not playing a character here) is also incredibly muscular. No opportunity to show off his 'guns' goes by without him whipping off his shirt, flexing, and looking philosophical, preferably whilst stitching up a knife wound one handed. One of the funniest scenes of all involves a young barmaid coming to visit Swayze out at his (ludicrously good) farm-loft apartment (which is also, coincidentally, just the other side of the river from the villain's hideout). She is fortunate enough to catch sight of Swayze's wet, muscular backside as he climbs out of the tub. We are treated to a close-up of her reaction, and one would think she'd just had an orgasm and won the lottery.More ridiculous than any of Swayze's posturing is the plot. How Ben Gazzara, the local super-villain, has managed to grow rich off this one-horse town is a mystery. He's almost certainly the number one employer so long as you're looking to move into thuggery, so vast is his army of morons.Later in the film, the hairy-lipped Sam Elliot enters as his typical slow-talking cowboy/wise-man stereotype. It's here that Swayze's ego actually takes a back seat and we witness him in awe of one of his peers. For some reason, Elliot is the real King of the Coolers, although the question of why a skinny old man should be better than Swayze is never answered. Frankly, who cares. Elliot still reminds me of Jerry Mouse's guitar-playing, whisker-grabbing Uncle.But the absolute high point of this film comes right at the end. As if you haven't been entertained enough, check out the speedo wearing Swayze's full-length flying dive into the river to swim with his new girlfriend. It has to be seen to be believed, and the young lady herself seems utterly perplexed at her situation - in that moment she realises she's dating not a man, but a two year old in a wrestler's body with a salami for a brain.This film is a testament to the truly mind-boggling ego of it's star, and the lack of talent of the writer and director. The writer has also written for Bronson and Seagal, and the director has managed only a couple more movies after this monstrosity, and his name is Rowdy.

Dirty Dancing (1987), Red Dawn (1984), The Outsiders (1983), basically anything popular at that time that was not made by John Hughes starred 1991's sexiest man alive. He possessed brawn of Kurt Russell yet carried himself without cynicism lending himself to big 'ol softy romantic leads.Road House (1989) firmly places Swayze's Dalton character in the brawny category in what essentially amounts to a watered down Sylvester Stallone vehicle. In the film Swayze plays an infamous bouncer who takes a job at a fledgling small town uber-bar. His first night in town he observes fistfights, bottle chucking, drug dealing and sexual assault all within the confines of the bar and decides to clean house. This catches the attention of the local evil-rich-white-dude (Ben Gazzara) who sees Dalton as an increasingly meddlesome problem.If you're into rough and tumble fight choreography and bloody violence I suppose there are worse things to watch than Road House. I can understand why it's a red-blooded American classic along the lines of Bloodsport (1988) and Smokey and the Bandit (1977). As the lead, Swayze is serviceable and is helped along by a second act appearance by Sam Elliott as fellow infamous bouncer Wade Garrett.Did tough bodybuilder-types have an informational magazine in the 80's where they can peruse through tales of bouncer/security guard lore? As soon as Dalton shows up to the Double Deuce everyone is anxious to get to know the man who ripped a man's throat out. The only person better known than Dalton is Sam Elliott's character who at the point of his introduction is working at a strip club. Being a bouncer is hardly a way to get recognition yet in this movie it's a way of life with an established fan base.The principle conflict in the movie escalates to absolutely ludicrous extremes. Its one thing to siphon all available resources like booze away from a competitor/enemy but it's another thing to get your goons to monster truck smash a car dealership in broad day light. Did anyone think to call the police at any point in this film? There is talk that they're on the take but then wouldn't they be useful to evil-rich-white-dude when Dalton starts to go on a killing spree? Wouldn't the cops be a little wary of running protection for a guy who starts blowing up dissenters' homes willy-nilly? Those are just some thoughts which prevent me from enjoying Road House or really any film of its caliber. The whole exercise appeals too much to our baser instincts and exhibits an unrealistic assault on the senses. Other than that though, I see no reason why Road House couldn't nor should appeal to others with different standards. The story works, the characters are decently developed and the physical hand-to-hand combat scenes are impressive to say the least.Swayze would go on to make a few more classics before his untimely death of pancreatic cancer in 2009. Whether you know him as the romantic Sam Wheat in Ghost (1990), the dashing Johnny in Dirty Dancing or even the daring Bodhi in Point Break (1991) there's little doubt that few will remember him as the gruff Dalton of Road House.http//www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com "}{"Title":"That's entertainment - Top Gun without the planes.","Date":"5 October 2012","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Thriller","Review":" I admit I do have a bit of a soft spot for this film.

The plot is quite simple as cooler Dalton (Patrick Swayze) is hired to clean up a rough bar and soon gets involved with a sadistic loon (Ben Gazzara) who runs the town. Soon Dalton gets a love interest (Kelly Lynch) as well as back up in another ultra-cool cooler (Sam Elliott). This movie is small on brains but large on action, breasts, violence, bar fights, drinking, smoking, loud rock music, throat-ripping, bad one-liners and all out entertainment. This movie has always played to me like a Western as we have a rundown town being held hostage by the bad guy and the loner rides into to town to take things back. This movie might not be the smartest thing out there but it makes up for that as being a pure adrenaline rush and in the end it's hard not to find yourself caught up in the story and characters. Swayze does a great job at playing the role as he can certainly act cool enough for the part and his fighting moves aren't too bad either. He even gets to shout out some nice one-liners especially an early scene when he's giving orders to the workers and one guy asks something about a mother line. Swayze's reply is priceless. Elliott is also wonderful in his part and you'd really have a hard time finding someone cooler than Sam and he really gets to be playful here. Lynch isn't too bad as the love interest and Gazzara appears to be having a blast playing the bad guy. All the supporting players from Gazzara's goons to the good guys are played nicely as well. This movie runs 114-minutes and there's really not a dry moment to be found. If there's not a fight going on then there's some sort of nudity. If there's no nudity then we've got some sort of other action. The Jeff Healey Band does a very good job with the soundtrack, which includes several original tunes as well as covers including Bob Dylan playing over the end credits.

And in case you think Dalton is too little to be a good bouncer, just wait until you see him rip a guy's throat out with his bare hand.Road House is everything a bad movie should be, and it's a hell of a lot more entertaining than a lot of legitimately good films.

Road House gets so progressively bizarre that it almost becomes good. Well, o.k. not good, maybe, but definitely fascinating. You can't tear your eyes away from the screen for fear you'll miss something classic.Do yourself a favor and don't watch the special feature on the DVD that shows Patrick Swayze and other cast members talking about the film. It's too obvious that even they thought it was over the top and a bit embarrassing, which harms its good bad movie vibe. It's no fun to watch a bad movie when the people in it KNOW it's a bad movie. I would, however, recommend watching the special feature called What Would Dalton Do?, in which a bunch of real-life bouncers talk about the character like he's a real person who they idolize.

The movie features veteran actor Ben Gazzara's best work as local businessman and town bully Brad Wesley, played so convincingly it's hard to separate Ben from Brad. I have to keep reminding myself Gazzara is only acting and is not actually the vile Wesley. The house band is in fact the Jeff Healey Band, who perform several live numbers, and guitar great Healey makes his acting debut as Cody, an old friend of Dalton. Healey's untimely death in 2008 make his performance here even more engaging. Sam Elliott plays Wade Garrett, Dalton's fatherly best friend and fellow cooler. Beautiful Kelly Lynch plays Dr. Elizabeth Clay, Dalton's local love interest. Other noteworthy performances include Kevin Tighe as road house entrepreneur Frank Tilghman; Marshall Teague (Jimmy), Wesley's top enforcer and tough guy; former professional wrestling World Champion Terry Funk (Morgan), a bouncer fired by Dalton; musician and actor John Doe (former front man of the new wave band X), who plays bartender Pat McGurn, fired by Dalton and who happens to be Wesley's nephew; and Julie Michaels (Denise), another Wesley associate, who's attracted to Dalton. Jon Paul Jones, Sunshine Parker and Red West play likable local businessmen terrorized by Wesley. Contains the best closing scene of any movie ever, in my opinion; the Jeff Healey Band performing a Bob Dylan song live, When the Night Comes Falling From the Sky, as the final credits roll. A musical gift from the short 41 year life of Jeff Healey. An excellent cast with an excellent soundtrack in an excellent movie you'll watch over and over again. It grows on you!

HOWEVER, I would rank his character and performance in this singular presentation as the MOST OUTRAGEOUS I've ever seen - and perhaps in the entire recorded history of entertainment on stage, screen, performance art, or even back to performances in ancient Roman and Greek presentations.Even Bugsy Siegel when having a manic episode, Al Capone at his angriest, or Don Corleone's Luca Braci, would be pussycats compared with the obsessive, sociopathetic, vicious town-bully portrayed by him in this offering. Even Corbin Bernsen's psychotic dentist in those made-for-TV flicks, with all the drilling, extracting and probing without benefit of Novocaine - compared with Gazarra here, make the doc seem simply like man with a slightly different approach to oral hygiene. This movie would rate about 2* for plot/story - but must be at least doubled for Ben's fascinatingly delightful and outrageous presence.

So let me focus on the first scene. That one is actually pretty cool. Swayze enters a bar, looks around, hardly says a word and shows he can act like Clint Eastwood. And he gets away with it! Of course the whole idea is a rip off, I refer to the three Leone westerns with Eastwood. Still, in that introductory scene, would Eastwood have done it better? There is a small line between non-acting and minimal acting and Swayze does not cross it. The excellent music (Jeff Healey) also help of course.After this everything goes downhill - just read the other negative reviews. The scene were Swayze tells his team to stay nice is bearable yet, but the rest is plain crap. The all time low is the s*x scene, which is the worst I have ever seen. Dogs have more subtlety. So one point for the first scene, a half for the music and a half for Swayze not screwing it up.

At least, that may have been the plan. Road House ain't big or clever, aiming instead for the hairy-chested brigade who just wanna watch something mindless with frequent bloody violence and cringe-worthy dialogue before the beers kick in. In that respect, Road House is a great movie but if you're wanting something a little deeper then you'd better move along right now.Swayze plays Dalton, a professional cooler who works on a temporary basis helping out untrained bouncers across the wilder parts of the southern US. Pitching up in a one-horse town near Kansas, he soon finds a job working at the Double Deuce - a wild bar where brawls are frequent and the women are powerless to resist Dalton's $4.99 aftershave. Falling in love with the town's doctor (Kelly Lynch) seemed like a good idea at the time until local gangster Brad Wesley (Ben Gazzara) interferes, sending in his hoodlums to target the bar and Dalton's best buddy Wade (Sam Elliott). With the sheriff in Wesley's pocket, it seems the unwilling townsfolk have no choice but to put up with... no, wait! Dalton decides to take Wesley down for good, using only his fighting skills, quivering bottom lip and menacing snarl to help him.Yeah. Really deep, isn't it? Essentially a retread of Seventies redneck classic Walking Tall, this movie promises much but actually delivers nothing but unintentional laughs. Despite Swayze's intentions to prove himself as popular with guys as he is with the ladies, he ends up looking like a camp Jean Claude Van-Damme and misses the mark by such a margin, it's amazing his career survived. As for the others, nobody really has much to do but swing their badly-timed punches at each other and wait for the stock punch sound effect first used by Adam & Eve in the Garden Of Eden. Only Lynch escapes the bloodshed but she proves ample eye-candy and nothing more. Suddenly, Dirty Dancing seems like a lifetime ago!So why has this dog's dinner ended up with a five? Well, it's a personal thing but the real star is Jeff Healy, the blind blues guitarist who recently died who crops up here with his band on stage and blows everybody away. The soundtrack is far, far better than the movie itself (if you like the blues, anyway) and to see Healy in action with the guitar laying across his lap is a marvel to behold. Maybe they should have gotten rid of Swayze and the ridiculous fight scenes and just stuck with a Jeff Healy set. Now that would be worth pulling over for but such as it is, Road House is like the last Little Chef café you just passed on the motorway - good to know it's there just in case but you wouldn't really miss it if it were gone.

Any film goer will appreciate his rough look and his devil-may-care attitude. Such a thing works in Western films, and it works here as the older compatriot of Swayze. However, on a personal level, its sad that Sam Elliot looks most likely to outlive Swayze to pancreatic cancer.The action is well done and there is plenty of male and female nudity between Swayze and Lynch. However, the story was sort of weak. I have a hard time understanding why the townsmen were in the house of Mr. Wesley during the final scene. They just sort of popped up out of nowhere and it was a little annoying.However, it is funny that the inept and vastly overweight henchman survived the ordeal, but the other ones lay dead due to Swayze.

In Roadhouse he's a bouncer with a Zen conscious. All the way from The Big Apple, James Dalton(Swayze) goes to this bar which is very, very rough at night. So instead of using his car, he would buy a older model to avoid serious vandalism. On the first night on the job, he gets hurt. The doctor(Kelly Lynch) staples him up. In that bar he meets a very old friend(Sam Elliot) who can kick some serious can. These two are warriors. The town they are in is being controlled by the richest bully Brad Garrett(Ben Gazzara). He and his cohorts do some serious damage to this nice town. The one scene I didn't like is when one of the goons drive the BIGFOOT Truck and turns the Ford dealership, into the Ford junkyard. With the rich bully controlling the town, Dalton is very smooth and very ready to take him out! The super-bouncer and several other victims help join the fight. The big guy who was one of Garrett's goons had the biggest fear of the taxidermy room. The stuffed polar bear gave him the creeps. The fight scenes were great. If it haven't been for Dalton, the town would be in fear forever. Patrick Swayze as a martial artist wouldn't surprise me one bit. If he can dance, he can fight as well. Don't be picking a fight with this man, he'll show both the door and the floor. 4 out of 5 stars!

About halfway into it, though, it really picks up.Basically, there is a rich man named Brad Wesley who runs the small town of Jasper. He is heartless, rude, and cruel. The people hate him, but fear him and his power and will not stand up to him. That is, until the seemingly invincible bouncer Dalton shows up. Dalton learns of his cruel tactics and doesn't like it, but Wesley goes too far and gets very personal later on in the movie, pushing Dalton over the edge. Once this starts to happen, this movie really picks up and becomes a good thriller. I actually enjoyed the last half of this movie, but the first half was unnecessary and boring. This movie easily could have been shortened. A few moments of bare boobs, sex, drinking, and bar fights would have been just fine. I would give this movie either a 6 or 7 out of 10.

Things get a little out of hand when the local mob boss (played by Ben Gazzara, perhaps better known as The Big Lebowski's Jackie Treehorn) wants to fight. Luckily, Dalton has a friend... an old-time bouncer played by Sam Elliott.This film is mentioned as Dawson Leery's (from Dawson's Creek) favorite movie, which seems really odd for a character who emulates Spielberg. The film is non-stop fight scenes that extend into full bar brawls. Okay, wait, not non-stop... there's also a fair amount of sex. Sex and nudity (both male and female). You will see more of Sam Elliott than you ever thought you would. And then back to the fighting.The bar brawls were enough to earn it the title of Second Best Fight Movie Ever (behind They Live, though the choreography of Clockwork Orange is impressive) in my mind, but then the fights turn grotesquely violent. This is either a good thing or a bad thing depending on what you're looking for. I find this to be the selling point of the film, knowing that Dalton has the strength and training to rip a man's windpipe out through his neck. Yet, he has the cool calmness of a zen master (one wonders how his majoring in philosophy fits into his character... if at all).There are a few things that seem strange if you're being picky. All stores and houses are packed wall to wall with propane tanks apparently, as explosions happen for no reason. Cops don't show up for fires, bar fights or the destruction of an entire car dealership (by a monster truck). They do show up once in the film without being called, when their presence no longer matters.This is the kind of movie I can watch over and over and over again. Not because it's a great film (although it is pretty darn good)... but because its absurdity is, well, absurd. The film takes place in a universe I can only dream of. Which, being a late 1980s film, I guess makes it perfectly normal in some way. Well, whatever the case, I loved it and you should love it, too.

It's much better than the likes of Next of Kin but not quite up to par with Swayze's performance in Ghost...which is what he turned into after the release of that movie, a ghost.This movie has a bit of everything from action/fighting scenes to tragedy to romance. The special effects aren't too horrible for its time and the acting is for the most part good. I like Sam Elliot and I enjoyed his role in this movie. The plot is a bit thin, but at least there is one and it's easy to follow.This is good for a rental on a night when you don't want to think, but still be entertained.

Patrick Swayze stars as Dalton (any true hero only needs one name), the World's Best Bouncer (although technically he is The Cooler--the lead bouncer in charge of orchestrating the mayhem-control).  He apparently roams the country looking for bars to clean up and stumbles into the Double Deuce,a bar which inexplicably pulls in hundreds of patrons a night even though it's supposed to be in a small town.  He proceeds to get rid of all the crooked help and turn his team of bouncers into the toughest, smoothest group around.  However, it's all almost undone by the town's evil rich man (played with wicked glee by Ben Gazzarra) who wants Dalton to join the dark side...or die!The dialogue in the movie is deliriously corny but still fun.  One of Dalton's 3 rules of bouncing is Be nice until it's time not to be nice.  When one of his bouncers asks him how they'll know it's time he responds, You won't.  You are the bouncers.  I am the cooler.  I will let you know when it's time.  Great stuff.Kelly Lynch is good as the leggy love interest.  Sam Elliot gives another great performance as Dalton's ultra-easygoing mentor.  Everything in the movie has a surreal larger and stupider than real life quality but they pull it off.  Even Gazzarra's henchman drive around in a monster truck...how can you beat that??  But they don't camp it down to the point of making it a kiddie movie.  If Gazzarra were a bumbling idiot or Swayze played practical jokes to upstage the henchman it wouldn't have worked.  What works is that the bad guys are bad, the good guys are good, and the alcohol plentiful.  If you're ready for this kind of enjoyment, I heartily recommend watching this movie as soon as possible!

Roadhouse is a lot of bad fun from a director who knows how to make films, coupled with a screenwriter who knows how to write them. Offered a chance to clean up this really bad nightclub, The Double Deuce, in a town owned by a really bad man Brad Wesley (Ben Gazzara) Dalton (Swayze) freely gives over his sports car (he doesn't like to fly) and takes his merc. Before he makes it to the door, of this redneck establishment, a guy comes flying out of this bar. Put in charge, Dalton (you could say he sets the bar straight) ha ha, fires a few bouncers, and a barmaid for selling drugs, before he gives a lecture on how this show is to run from now on, re-itering his point on being nice, to the point of not being nice. You should see what happens if you come at Swayze with a knife. After all he's majored in philosophy, and obviously by his I knew it smile, he's had his car tires slashed more than once. He's also a charmer, and has a such a way with words, especially to one of Gazzara's goon's hottie girlfriends. Also pain doesn't bother Dalton. Why? He doesn't let it. I never heard anything so stupid. Unfortunately the people he sacked, and he sacks a few more, one skimming the till, the other, a stud type, doing a hot bimbo in a backroom, are associate's of Wesley's, so you know what this means. Roadhouse is violent in other parts, an exaggeration of bar fights, and their bouncers where this one is more like a zoo. He requests his old bouncer friend come down (Sam Elliot) who he recommended to the Double's Deuces owner (Kevin Tighe from that hit t.v. series, Emergency, remember) at the start. They make a hell of a team too. Swayze falls in love with a medic, (Kelly Lynch) who compliments his stitch work, from a wound he took at the Deuce. And guess what? She was also once involved with Wesley. We finally come to a point in the movie where we've taken enough of Gazzara, who really is CRAZY! and realize Swayze has to end him. Though a bit overly violent, Roadhouse is good fun, but again falls to lame brainer status. Swayze, the avenger in the end, with his support, provide an almost stereotypical climax killing off Wesley's goons, before getting Wesley, one chubby fella having a stuffed polar bear fall on top of him in his trophy room. Swayze adds a comic line to end this shot, very much the same way, Seagal would. Actually this long climactic part, ran similar rivers as in that Burt Reynold's flop, Malone. Roadhouse ends happily with a great sound track, and may a new day begin at the Double Deuce until the next trouble maker walks through the door.

Patrick Swayze plays the charming Dalton, a 'cooler' (head bouncer) enlisted to clean up a troubled mid-west road house bar, the Double Deuce. The movie features veteran actor Ben Gazzara's best work as local businessman and town bully Brad Wesley, played so convincingly it's hard to separate Ben from Brad. I have to keep reminding myself Gazzara is only acting and is not actually the vile Wesley. The house band is in fact the Jeff Healey Band, who perform several live numbers, and guitar great Healey makes his acting debut as Cody, an old friend of Dalton. Healey's untimely death in 2008 make his performance here even more engaging. Sam Elliott plays Wade Garrett, Dalton's fatherly best friend and fellow cooler. Beautiful Kelly Lynch plays Dr. Elizabeth Clay, Dalton's local love interest. Other noteworthy performances include Kevin Tighe as road house entrepreneur Frank Tilghman; Marshall Teague (Jimmy), Wesley's top enforcer and tough guy; former professional wrestling World Champion Terry Funk (Morgan), a bouncer fired by Dalton; musician and actor John Doe (former front man of the new wave band X), who plays bartender Pat McGurn, fired by Dalton and who happens to be Wesley's nephew; and Julie Michaels (Denise), another Wesley associate, who's attracted to Dalton. Jon Paul Jones, Sunshine Parker and Red West play likable local businessmen terrorized by Wesley. Contains the best closing scene of any movie ever, in my opinion; the Jeff Healey Band performing a Bob Dylan song live, When the Night Comes Falling From the Sky, as the final credits roll. A musical gift from the short 41 year life of Jeff Healey. An excellent cast with an excellent soundtrack in an excellent movie you'll watch over and over again. It grows on you!

This guy makes quick work leaving his mark taking out those he thinks will not be good for the place and begins the cleaning up process. Then he fires one dude and the movie shifts to a strange power battle with Swayze's character and a local guy who has a lot of power and is a bit of a crazy guy. I did not care for this turn of events and the only thing that salvages the rest of the film is the introduction of Sam Elliot as another really good bouncer. I just like Sam Elliot as he has a lot of movies where he makes brief appearances, but they are great. Ghostrider comes to mind as an example of this. There is also the standard love interest, however this part of the plot was fine and would have worked in a more simple film better.

Now, I can suspend my disbelief long enough to handle a bar owner hiring a bouncer to fight off the crime boss of the town. However, Ben Gazzara's character is so over the top, who can really believe it. I mean, it might be believable if he is some sinister mafia boss protected by layers and layers of corruption, but when he openly orders wholesale destruction of property? How does that not get notice from higher authorities or the media? Devoid of a believable antagonist, the rest of the movie really just breaks down. There is absolutely no suspense on how it will turn out, nor is there enough action. It is funny how time changes your perspective on something. In 1989 it seemed like a really cool action film.

Hard to believe it was made in 1989, because it includes so many details which would have been considered cliches in 1939.Here's the idea. Before I start, I need to tell you that this takes place in the present, not in the Old West. That's important, because it's really just an old western, as you'll see when you read through the plot summary. Hint think ShaneA powerful landowner with a savage taste for hunting gets all his kicks from his domination of a small town and all its inhabitants. Ben Gazzara plays this part. Don't miss the scene where Gazzara sings Shboom, shboom!Ben comes complete with all the movie evil accoutrements, like llama heads in his paneled den. How hard could it be to kill a llama? They are big clumsy-looking pack animals and they don't live in places where they can hide or run away. In my den, I have the heads of dairy cows. Now that's good hunting. I also enjoy hunting for Koalas. They sometimes go for hours without muscle movement, so you don't have to waste any bullets.Only one man is prepared to challenge Big Ben. The owner of a local bar simply wants to fix up his old joint and live his life, but Gazzara's goons keep roughing up the joint and scaring off the paying customers and demanding the usual protection money. How to fight back? The owner of the bar just happens to know the world's greatest bouncer. Oh, and the bouncer brings along his mentor, and together they stand tall against Ben and his henchmen.The world's greatest bouncer is Patrick Swayze, then one of the hottest properties in filmdom after his success two years earlier in Dirty Dancing. He's a piece of work. He wears a stoic expression, perhaps because he studied the Stoics while obtaining his Ph.D. in Philosophy from NYU. He also wears expensive Armani clothing (black is his color) and drives a Mercedes. Being an itinerant and lonely bouncer cleaning up run-down Midwestern dives isn't that glamorous, but the pay must be sweet. No wonder he gave up his professorship.Of course, his immersion in the highlights of human thought have given him the insight necessary to utter such lines as Pain don't hurt. There will be a test on this later. I think that line probably cracked me up more than any other in film history. The previous record holder, not surprisingly, had been in a comedy, only the singing Hitlers over here. Dancing Hitlers over there. (You film buffs know the movie). Anyway, my buds and I swaggered around for years, whenever we would see each other, and intoned pain don't hurt. Interesting question for the philosophers amongst you. If pain don't hurt, what does? And why do they call it pain? I'll leave the answers up to you, because these trees falling in an empty forest questions always hurt my head.   Although, interestingly enough, when my head hurts there can be no pain, because.... (Your answer here).I told you there would be a test.There is also an interesting fight scene. Swayze is battling a knife-wielding goon. He relieves the guy of his knife with some proven technique of ancient Zen philosophy. Confucius once wrote that while the pen is mightier that the sword, he would prefer to deliver an enemy not a witty epigram from his quill, but a swift kick in the privates from his pointed shoes.My translation from Mandarin may be a bit inexact.Anyway, somehow the knife mysteriously reappears in the guy's hand, and Swayze uses the exact same maneuver to taunt him and remove the knife a second time. An important lesson for us all. If you have to do a second take on a scene - why waste it?Oh, and the back-up cast. Make room for wrestler Terry Funk and Kevin Tighe. Tighe plays a guy named Tilghman, presumably so he won't have to learn any new consonants.Oh, and the dancing. Remember this is a forgotten town about as run-down as the mining camp in Paint Your Wagon, but all the chicks in the bar can dance broadway schtick.Anyway, not many movies are so bad they are good. Most bad movies are bad because they are boring. But this one is not boring for a minute. In fact, Road House is one of the greatest comedies ever filmed, although I don't think the filmmakers were aware of it. It is worth watching, and has a great rock 'n roll score, but I strongly suggest that you do so under the influence of mood-altering substances and in the company of like-minded goofballs.Bottom line - ya gotta see it.

Patrick Swayze is playing a certified hardass hired to clean up a bar in a corrupt town. He ends up fighting an evil syndicate hell bent on milking the townsfolk for every penny they've got. Yes, this plot line sounds like an episode of Walker Texas Ranger and plays like one too, however it is a wonderfully entertaining piece of cinema. Towards the end an exceptionally late introduction of Wade results in the feeling of a rushed plot line, and a truly ill placed stripping scene managed to cheapen the entire movie. Aside from that it has a wonderful eighties charm and wonderful eighties big hair.

He carries the film flawlessly and is without a doubt the most talented actor in the film. Road House for the most part comes across as campy, and filled with gratuitous nudity and violence galore (an absolute eighties action flick to a T.) Despite the moments of gratuity Road House actually supports a fairly strong storyline if not a might predictable and sadly the supporting cast kind of falters against Swayze's strong performance. Nonetheless Road House is a classic for a reason and is the perfect escape film to get your blood pumping and feel good at the end of it.Patrick Swayze leads the cast playing professional cooler (bouncer) Dalton. Swayze is slick and quiet and kind of brooding. He's almost got a Clint Eastwood type persona where you know anyone who crosses him is gonna get an ass kicking and that's exactly what happens with style and grace. Swayze moved like a master when it came to Martial Arts and dancing in those days and this shows off his action skills. He is the only one in this cast who doesn't come across as campy and rather empty. His character has depth and importance and he carries the film. Kelly Lynch plays the eighties gal, Dalton's love interest Dr. Clay. One minute she seems so empty and annoying and then a couple of times she really lets loose a decent performance. Overall though she was hired because she's blonde and gets naked on cue. Sam Elliott looks very tough and plays a good role as Swayze's mentor Wade Garrett. Unfortunately he's not really utilized enough and we don't really get a good feel on him until it's too late. Still he does decent in his role, second best performance to Swayze. Ben Gazzara plays bad guy, family boss Brad Wesley. He's alright as a enemy to Swayze but he's very campy and never really scary but more annoying. The stuff he does to Swayze just makes him look like a scared little kid and he ends up meeting a brutal end. I think a better actor could have made for a terrific adversary.Road House takes on an unusual story about bouncers and gives them a very real existence and you fall in love with their story. It's a story about bravery and friendship and struggles and a fight breaks out every five minutes which gives you enough action to keep you happy. It's exactly everything that eighties classics are known for and that's why it's a must see and it truly is entertaining. Director Rowdy Herrington kind of lucked out I think in doing this film because it's just one of those things that became a cult phenomenon and in one hand you wonder why and in the other you can't help but love it. If you haven't seen Road House well everyone needs to!! 8/10 "},{"Title":"Another B movie given theatrical treatment.","Date":"12 December 2005","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Thriller","Review":" Thanks mostly in part to Swayze's presence who himself just came in hot off the heals of DIRTY DANCING, (That's right, his name alone meant money for the box office!) here he plays a bouncer who is hired to take out the scum at a bar called the Double Deauce, nonetheless he ain't welcome according to a few members of the bar who like doing as they please be it legal or not, so they set out to make trouble for him, including their leader BRAD WESLY, who wants our hero out of the way permanently. ROAD HOUSE is strictly for those who enjoy all those macho action flicks that is almost extinct now, but was pretty prevalent at the time of this films release, PATRICK SWAYZE turned out to be a good choice to play DALTON the hero who has a rep for almost killing a guy & SAM ELLIOT was equally as entertaining as his friend, the rough & tough WADE GARRETT. There is plenty of action to satisfy any action fans thirst, all that aside however, ROAD HOUSE will probably remind you of all those B movie action flicks that wind up going direct to video, with it's sometime bloody fight scenes, over abundance of action & more nudity than most B action films supply. Still the acting was good & Director Harrington shows some great skill behind the camera, a pretty decent watch, just nothing spectacular & not as good as one of the Writers LETHAL WEAPON. Followed by a direct to video sequel, ROAD HOUSE 2 LAST CALL *** stars "},{"Title":"Patrick in his most FORCEFUL roles ever!","Date":"13 November 2004","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Thriller","Review":" Road house is an excellent movie. Those of us Patrick Swayze fans out there can rest assured thet he will be kicking ass in an epic fashion. He plays DALTON who is the best cooler in the business, and is hired to clean up a squalid bar. he's a head bouncer there and knows his stuff. But there is more, he has a love interest too! Without giving too much away, the action is great, the fight scenes are forceful and Patrick plays the role of Dalton to a T!!! The amount of force that this movie supplies is off the chart! And don't forget to check out other titles, such as Steel dawn, Next of kin, Dirty dancing and RED DAWN which I have yet to watch! I suggest you watch it ASAP you can prolly pick up a cheap version on VHS.

This movie has an amazingly trashy reputation, and you can instantly see why! Despite its very good production values (cinematography by Dean Cundey, for example), this is a movie that has no aspirations but to be as brainless as can be! A movie that first starts out as a bouncer taming a wild bar turns into an impossibly over-the-top story about a crazy megalomaniac (Ben Gazarra, completely embarrassing himself here!) vs. the helpless townsfolk.The movie only gets bigger and dumber as it goes along! Patrick Swayze is, of course, a B-movie actor at best. But, having people like Gazarra and Sam Elliott in this is downright silly! How this every got greenlit is anybody's guess. I was honestly amazed at how incredibly insane this movie got! Michael Kamen's film score is pulpy, as usual. And, you have to love how this is supposed to be set in a town near Kansas City, but it's endlessly obvious throughout the movie that it's in California. Over and over and over again, there are mountains in the background, there are road signs that are clearly California highway signs, other signs that say California here and there, etc. Why not just set it in California? Why not?*** BEGIN SPOILERS ***You ABSOLUTELY know that Sam Elliott is going to get killed! You know that when Swayze leaves him at the bar, he's going to be dead when Swayze gets back! Gazarra gets a wonderfully grisly sendoff, getting close to Scarface level. Nice!*** END SPOILERS ***This is one of the all-time stupidest movies ever! Thank you, Hollywood, thank you!p.s. Jeff Healey, who's unfortunately gone now, provides great blues music as the bar's resident guitar slinger!** (2 Out of 10 Stars) "},{"Title":"There is a main actor missing from your cast list","Date":"26 December 2008","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Thriller","Review":" Why is J.T.Walsh missing from your cast list?- It seems he is listed in Good Morning Vietnam but not Road House- what's going on? I'm sorry I can't find somewhere else to make this statement, but to me this seems like a major point. After all, I just saw J.T. appear in an old cut from Good Morning Vietnam and at first couldn't remember his name but immediately I thought of him as being the owner of the Road House of the movie in question- however when I looked this up on the IMDb site he was being completely blanked. I know he was in the movie as I've seen it several times. Can someone please enlighten me as to the problem you guys have with giving him the credit for actually being in the movie.

So let's just stick with the foundation upon which this heap of wasted stock is precariously perched, shall we? First and foremost, the acting is terrible. I haven't experienced such horrible chemistry since I mixed ammonia and bleach inside of my mouth to celebrate the release of Grease 2. Patrick Swayze takes himself way too seriously and is right at home overacting amidst a veritable nontourage of also-rans and the cinematic versions of fighters who've taken and will continue to take dive after dive after dive. The overtly sexual/seduction scenes are awkward and clumsily unsexy, employing generous arm loads of bad music, bad lighting, bad hairdos and bad costumes and should serve as an embarrassment to Ben Gazzara and Sam Elliott, the only two real actors that the production allowed considering the money that was probably spent to cash in on the popularity of, and then equip the bayou bandits and bumpkin bad guys with, Big Foot, the monster truck that, at the time was bringing yokels, hillbillies and morons alike together in some of the finest third-tier arenas across the country for car crushing entertainment at it's very best. And at only ten bucks a ticket. Mercy sakes alive! Though I'm not a fan, I'd like to give the film's best performance to The Jeff Healy Band and their grand, but futile efforts to breathe some life into rhythm and blues tunes best left to their creators and the past masters like Clapton, Jeff Beck, etc. However, appearing in this heap of dung makes them no better than the maggots and larvae that squirm throughout the entire mess. Boo to everybody involved in Rowdy Herrington's Road House. Boo. Boo. Boo.

It is like taking a movie like 'Manos Hands of Fate' and giving it a $10,000,000 make over. Then adding star power just to ruin their acting careers. It is an a-typical B Movie. Mediocre acting. Impossible plot line. I tried to follow it but I kept having to turn away from making some snide remark or riffing the living daylights out of it. No one that has seen it can say a kind word about it. It is unfortunate that it was made because a lot of promising careers where hemmed in after this picture was finished. Sometimes I am glad for good cinema like Good Night, and Good Luck that can redeem what movies such as Road House does to society. I just don't understand giving a 4 or a 5 rating on a B movie. Thats why I gave it a 1. I wish they had decimals because it would have received probably a 0.0002 or something along those regards.

The script writer must have slipped into a coma before putting pen to paper. The dialogue was predictable and clichéd, the acting was very poor and the plot was mind numbing. The Swayze adds his unique 80's class to the role of the protagonist but even the comedy value didn't redeem this movie. I don't know how I managed to miss this movie in the 80's but I wish I'd missed it in the 00's too. I'm afraid I can't find it in myself to write anything good about this stupefying movie. Anyone who likes movies should avoid this one like the plague.

The fight scenes were as unrealistic, mediocre and useless as they come. With a fight movie like this there is no plot; it is rather a shoving of Patrick Swayze and fake blood together. Also, this film is filed with cliché lines that try to be classics in film, and probably are in Redneck towns, but are just stupid to me. And hey, i had no clue that by staying in a single position and thrusting forward(which a female brawler does in this film), you can deliver a punch strong enough to cause a nosebleed. I only watched 5 and 1/2 minutes of Road House, because if i watched anymore i would have lost a few dozen I.Q points. "}]
