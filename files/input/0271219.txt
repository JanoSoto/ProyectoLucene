[{"Title":"Reviewers missing the point","Date":"29 July 2003","Score":"51 out of 54 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  I'm perplexed by the number of people who seem to miss the crucial element of this film that Oscar is not as mature as he thinks he is.  His love for Eve doesn't feel real to the viewer because it's not.  His patter--at tea, in the bar, and elsewhere--feels forced and self-conscious because it is.  Because he is very intelligent, he makes the classic adolescent mistake of overestimating his own maturity and the force of his own feelings.  As Diane, Bebe Neuwirth points out that it's not his maturity that draws so many women to him, but that he is still unjaded.  That is, his most attractive quality is in fact the precise opposite of what he thinks it is. Eve's rebuff, though a bit ambivalent, forces him to reevaluate his own feelings.  The film's only major flaw is that it leaves this process underexplicated, but when at the end he is more responsive to his classmate's overtures it becomes clear that he is starting to see the light, however vaguely.  The film's point is thus obvious a crucial part of growing up is realizing how much growing up one has left to do.  That it makes this point in such a refreshing, funny, and absurd way is the film's charm.

There are points where you feel they haven't followed something up enough, or explained something enough, but this film has better developed characters than almost any other romantic comedy you could name. Plus, of course, explanation isn't everything. In fact, sometimes, you're better off without it. A film that requires you to think, speculate or assume what might have happened between scenes - or before the film started - isn't that a good thing?Much has been made of the DV look of the film, but I hardly noticed - and I like a well shot piece of celluloid as much as the next person. Sometimes, though, you just don't need the gorgeous, sweeping vistas of Lawrence of Arabia - and this is a small, independent gem. The use of DV is probably rather more to do with budget than laziness. In fact laziness would seem to be an unlikely part of the equation, what with the film being shot in a fortnight.If the thought of a 15-year-old spouting Voltaire fills you with the urge to punch someone, this probably isn't the film for you. But how often does a thoughtful, not formulaic, intelligent, witty film come along.

He regularly speaks French in his normal life, and seems to always be reading Voltaire (the one liners seen throughout the film as inter-titles are apparently Voltaire quotes).The film happens over a long Thanksgiving weekend in New York City. We first see Oscar on the train on his way home, briefly talking to a pretty classmate who seems interested in him. After she leaves, Oscar's friend Charlie (Robert Iler from The Sopranos), who may be the sanest character in the film, asks Oscar about her, and Oscar dismisses her by saying that her hands are those of a baby. Apparently he appreciates hands that show more character.We soon learn that the hands he really likes belong to Eve (Sigourney Weaver). She's a medical researcher, whose marriage to Oscar's father, Stanley (John Ritter), makes her Oscar's stepmother. Oscar does not seem deterred by this little obstacle. I can see his point, as I am also a huge fan of Weaver's (even going so far as to see Heartbreakers), but the age difference is pretty extreme, not to mention that little almost incest issue.Diane (Bebe Neuwirth from Cheers), is a chiropractor who is Eve's best friend. *You might want to skip the rest of this paragraph if you don't know much about the film already.* Oscar runs into Diane late at night after drinking too much, and when he smells Eve's perfume on a scarf Diane borrowed, Oscar accidentally ends up sleeping with her. This scenario is of course reminiscent of The Graduate, although Oscar's age causes some to question whether this is comedy or statutory rape. I vote for the former, and in fact Oscar's inexplicable ability to easily be served alcohol in a neighborhood bar bothered me more.Much comedy ensues. In fact, it occurred to me later that low budget independent films are rarely comedies, and even more rarely this well done. The writing was was only adequate to good, but the performances were very good, especially from Bebe Neuwirth. And some of the wordless reaction shots are priceless.The film was shot on digital video and transferred to film for distribution to most theaters. I have read complaints about the quality, but it seemed tolerable to me, except perhaps in the opening shots from the train. What matters is that it is not distracting.I enjoyed this film quite a bit. It isn't life altering in the slightest, but it isn't trying to be. It's definitely worth checking out.Seen on 8/31/2002.

The problem is that the woman he fancies himself in love with now is his very own stepmother, a heart specialist appropriately enough named Eve. Despite the admittedly touchy subject matter, `Tadpole' exudes a great deal of undeniable charm, thanks, primarily, to superb performances by a first-rate cast and to the wry humor of much of the Heather McGowan/Niels Muller screenplay.  Aaron Stanford and Sigourney Weaver are wonderful as Oscar and Eve, two extremely intelligent people who know that in other circumstances they might have been able to act on their feelings but who have the wisdom and maturity to see things for what they truly are.  The possibility of giving into a `forbidden love' can exert a powerful force on an individual, and `Tadpole' does a nice job capturing that theme in a lighthearted, non-threatening way.Of course, `Tadpole' taps into that age-old fantasy of a young boy's obsession with an older woman and one wonders how the audience would feel if the situation were reversed and he were the 40 year-old and she the 15 year-old in the relationship.  I suspect, somehow, that a film on that subject would carry with it a darker, more sinister tone than the one we find in `Tadpole.'   Actually, there are a number of very funny scenes in this film, with much of the humor deriving from the secrecy, misunderstandings and double entendres that would naturally arise from such a situation.  Indeed, some of the movie plays like classic Restoration farce with an ersatz-incestuous twist.  A good deal of the humor arises from the fact that the older women in the film see in this precocious teenager the kind of passion, intelligence and sensitivity that they don't find in men their own age.  Director Gary Winick shot the film in a digital format, giving the movie a slightly shaggy `independent' feel.   This heightens the sense of intimacy and immediacy needed to confront this particular topic without seeming to exploit it at the same time.  A slicker, more `commercial' look and approach would most likely have made the film appear too sleazy, distasteful and arch.	As it is, we are amused at the same time we are appalled. `Tadpole,' by lowering the protagonist's age and keeping the matter `all in the family' so to speak, has brought `The Graduate' into the 21st Century.

Ritter plays the busy working father in one of his rare serious roles and is excellent, as is Weaver as the woman who discovers that her son has been having an affair with her best friend (BEBE NEUWIRTH). Neuwirth makes the most of her sly comic scenes as a temptress who awakens hormones in the teen-ager. A restaurant scene with the boy and his parents is a highlight of the story, where her deceptive conduct is exposed by Ritter's observation of an indiscretion in a mirrored image.Witty and humorous, never taking itself seriously, it's an amiable tale told with deft touches and it moves briskly under Gary Winick's nimble direction with some nice glimpses of Manhattan's upper east side.

On the surface, from reading the description this movie seems like innocent fun. A teenage boy (Peter Appel) falls in love with his stepmother (Sigourney Weaver). It seems almost refreshing, since most movies about stepmothers have her as the hated one. But I found this movie disturbing, and not in a way that sometimes makes a movie worth watching. (SPOILERS AHEAD)Much of the movie revolves around the sexual encounter between Jimmy (Appel) and Dianne (Bebe Neuwirth), which becomes the source of what comedy there is in this movie. Excuse me? Reverse the roles for a moment. If a forty-something man had had a sexual encounter with a 15-year old girl, people would be up in arms about this movie. There would have been calls to ban it. But when it's a forty-something woman fooling around with a 15-year old boy, suddenly it becomes a cute, funny coming of age story? And it's loaded with cliche lines like he's old enough to take care of himself; you're old enough to make your own decisions. No he's not - he's 15! This is the classic double standard. It's good for a teenage boy to have experiences with an older woman; it's scandalous if a teenage girl has the same experiences with an older man. (I find it scandalous either way, and I'm embarrassed to admit that at one point I fell into the double standard too and found myself wondering why the kid would even be interested in Sigourney Weaver when he could have the incredibly sensual Bebe Neuwirth! It just shows how deeply ingrained this double standard is in us.)There was some potential here, had the story revolved around the truly rather innocent love Jimmy felt for stepmom Eve, but I just couldn't get around the double standard. For what it's worth, the performances were generally all right, except for John Ritter as Jimmy's dad, who came across as rather uninterested through most of the picture.2/10  "},{"Title":"Only a Reasonable Entertainment","Date":"2 January 2005","Score":"6 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Oscar Grubman (Aaron Stanford) is a fifteen years old French student, who lives in USA, and spends the Thanksgiving with his father Stanley Grubman (John Ritter) and his stepmother Eve (Sigourney Weaver) in their apartment in New York. His mother is French and lives in France. Oscar is very precocious, cultured, polyglot and loves poetry, and he finds the girls of his age very silly, feeling a great attraction for older women. Oscar has a crush on his stepmother. However, her forty and something years best friend Diane Lodder (Bebe Neuwirth) has an affair with Oscar, and he becomes quite confused with this new situation. Tadpole is a reasonable comedy only, having some funny situations, but never reaching a target, having a terrible conclusion. When the viewer finishes watching the film, he will certainly ask -What is the point? Further, in accordance with the information in IMDb, Aaron Stanford was born in 1977. Therefore, he was completely miscast, being twenty-five years old and pretending he is fifteen. Further, he is not charismatic as his character would require. John Ritter is a reasonable actor, but looks very snob in the role of a history professor of Columbia. Sigourney Weaver is lost, in a character who is neither Mrs. Robinson nor an example of a faithful wife. The best parts of the story belong to Bebe Neuwirth, who is amazingly funny and makes the film worth, together with its soundtrack.

In real life, with his attitude towards women, this guy couldn't get laid in a whorehouse.  He's the type of arrogant dickhead that women laugh at and turn away from in disbelief.       Yet, in this...whatever...piece, women are flocking towards him in unbelievable numbers.  Sure, I could understand if these were women that have no self-esteem or confidence, and actually wanted a man to abuse them so they could feel some sense of importance.  After all, even abuse is a form of attention that they otherwise wouldn't be getting.  But no, these are attractive, confident, successful professional women, and that's what I don't get, and that's where the whole premise of this film falls apart.  There is not one speck of reality or believability in either the characters or the situations.  No confident, successful woman would ever, and I mean EVER put up with the endless torrent of condescension this dickhead unapologetically throws their way.

Directed by Gary Winick. Starring Aaron Stanford, John Ritter, Sigourney Weaver, Bebe Neuwirth, Robert Iler, Peter Appel and Kate Mara.This movie is like Sara Palin's ultimate fantasy about how the residents of New York City are intellectually pretentious and morally degenerate.Oscar Grubman (Aaron Stanford) is a 15 year old kid who's come home from boarding school to spend Thanksgiving with his dad and stepmom. Aaron Stanford looks like he's closer to 30 than 15, but that turns out to be a good thing as the film goes along. Oscar is the sort of budding college literary dick that thinks reading Voltaire and speaking French at his age is some sort of accomplishment. He also thinks teenage girls are beneath him. That's because Oscar is in love with his stepmom, Eve (Sigourney Weaver). Standing in the way of his semi-Oedipel ambitions are Oscar's clueless doorstop of a father (John Ritter) and Eve's best friend (Bebe Neuwirth), who Oscar ends up sleeping with in a moment of weakness. After a comedy of manners dinner and a laughably heartfelt scene between Oscar and Eve, Tadpole concludes by actually asking the audience to seriously consider that maybe Eve should have an affair with her 30 years younger stepson.If an actor who genuinely looked 15 had been cast as Oscar, watching this film would have been a thoroughly skeevy experience. Since Stanford looks old enough to have played a teenager on the original Beverly Hills 90210, that's not an issue. Robbed of its pedophilic overtones, however, Tadpole stands revealed as an aimless piece of crap. This is a 45 year olds half formed fantasy of what he wishes had happened to him when he was 15 after he's forgotten was it was really like to be that age. The only good thing about this story is that at only 78 minutes long, it never has time to wallow in its own crapulence.This is a comedy where no one tells a joke and then it gets all serious at the end, as though there's some profound meaning to be discovered in a teenager wanting to screw his stepmom. It's the sort of movie that repeatedly flashes Voltaire quotes up on the screen. It's a film that confuses sophistication with Three's Company-style misunderstandings. I'm sure there are some folks who think the pretentiousness of Tadpole is intentional. That it's a satire of that sort of urban intellectual preoccupation. The flaw in that theory is that Oscar's pretensions are validated at every step along the way. Instead of portraying him as a deluded kid who only thinks 40 year old women would be attracted to him, the movie actually has a gaggle of 40 year old women find Oscar attractive. The only person in the entire story who finds Oscar's affection for Eve even slightly objectionable is his fellow classmate and comedy relief sidekick Charlie (Robert Iler). Oscar's father isn't bothered when he finds out his son slept with his wife's best friend. Heck, Eve isn't even that bothered when she finds out her best friend slept with her stepson. And when she finally figures out that Oscar is in love with her, instead of finding it silly or shocking or cute, Eve is deeply moved by it. She doesn't laugh in his face. She gets all quiet and pensive. But the more seriously you take the situation, the more seriously you have to take the ethical, psychological and ethical implications of it. Tadpole never does any of that, yet it does take things too seriously to generate any humor out of the absurdity of the situation. You will find some laughs here, but you'll always been laughing at the movie and not with it.There is one good thing about this film and that's the work of the slinky Bebe Neuwirth. Her character may be morally repugnant, but she's also funny, sexy and enticing. She's like that naughty relative you love seeing at family reunions but would become a chore if you saw them all the time. There might have been a pretty good story to tell about this woman playing emotional and mental games with Oscar, but these filmmakers never noticed it.Tadpole is a movie that started out as a bad idea and never got any better as things went along. Unless you're a George W. Bush voter who'd like to have your prejudices about Barack Obama voters confirmed, you can give this film a pass.

Sorel would have rationalized some way to manipulate his impure love, at one with his purer desire. But maybe some of this is already in the film and the character. Tadpole's best and funniest moments have Oscar and Neuwirth sparing as equals. As soon as it begins to soar though, it backs off. Weaver's directed to act ethereal, and that's what she does, as if she never loses sight of her image in the fictional Oscar's eye. To the film's loss, she seems to act not so much the innocently unaware object of Oscar's fantasy as the maudlin fantasy itself. She acts against the film's fictional reality. Maybe such things aren't feasible with a big star in a small film, but I would have, as much as possible, denied her access to the parts of the script that define Oscar. If not that, then I would have written her flawed somehow, fatally bored through some self-interest of her own with husband Ritter, or overwhelmed with a nonsexual crush on Neuwirth, inspired by Neuwirth's lack of restraint. She is, after all, as Oscar keeps saying, his STEPmother. Aside from Oscar's not-quite-past-jailbait age, and her legal marriage to Ritter, she's approximately as legal as Woody Allen was. Give her the freedom to truly hesitate over Oscar. I'm sure Neuwirth scares the hell out of some of the film's audience. Weaver, the bigger star, should have been allowed somehow to up the ante, to compete with Neuwirth, if not in details of the plot, then just as actress to actress. Neuwirth acts. Weaver's been allowed only to pose and pander.

Indeed, I found it nosedivingly painful to watch Tadpole's director essentially make stone soup by plopping one good ingredient &#150; John Ritter &#150; into a tepid crock pot of bland cinematography and unseasoned writing. Innumerable awkward allusions are made to some cringingly obvious classic movies, a naive and gratuitous gesture that predictably backfires because this film is so very far below par. While Tadpole is undeniably well cast, it doesn't take a well-intentioned semi-retired film critic to see that the actors are constantly distracted, baffled, and undermined by the guy behind the camera who undoubtedly was constantly waving his hands this way and that, shouting silent directions and peppering the crew with psychodrama, only to throw up his arms in tizzying despair. I can empathize; it is incredibly difficult to maintain one's composure in the face of utter incompetence. Even the thankful restraints of a low budget and a limited release cannot adequately squash the director's grandiose, adolescent, film-student angst.  "},{"Title":"My...

It turns out this film is NOT just about that, but ultimately leading to how he has such high expectations.  He doesn't really come across as a snob but rather as an adult trapped in a kid's body.  What Tadpole really is about is Oscar trying to adjust to life at his age and girls who are as old as he is.  Oscar (Aaron Stanford)  I don't know.  I just don't think they've lived long enough.Eve  Why don't you give them a chance?I knew that from hearing these two lines of dialog, Tadpole would not be a raunchy or sick kind of film.  The ending concludes that Oscar Grubman just needs to relax and open himself up and learn to accept Eve as his stepmother, instead of falling in love with her.  In terms of the love parts of this film, I really like how there's more talk and conversation.  It makes you think that these characters are really getting to know one and another.  The scene where Oscar meets Eve at her laboratory in Columbia University is just showing how much Oscar wants a mature and articulate woman.  He's not a perverted or stupid guy who thinks of getting in a girl's pants.  All in all, this is one of those rare mature and honest films that deals with a issue like this in an intelligent, not mundane way.  I wish more films made today were like this.Only problem with this film is that the digital look makes this film look funny.  Director Garry Winick needs to realize that making a motion picture on film guarantees a much better resolution and texture than digital video does.  Lower cost filmmaking isn't necessarily the better solution (unless you're a first time filmmaker).By the way, Roger Ebert gives this film thumbs down.  I swear, Ebert is loosing his reputation as a Pulitzer Prize winning film critic.

He has no romantic time for girls his own age - he actually prefers women, for their maturity and experience. In fact, he has a crush on his worldly stepmother Eve (Sigourney Weaver), whom he idealizes. In an amusing farcical turn of events, he sleeps with Eves' friend Diane (Bebe Neuwirth, who's never looked sexier).This is a reasonably funny, lightly entertaining comedy about a young man with lots of book smarts and an endearing amount of naivety which is precisely what some people find intriguing about him. Stanford is just right in the lead role, even if he's clearly older than what he's playing. Neuwirth is irresistible as the saucy older woman (just imagine the trouble the character would be in in real life, though!). John Ritter is good as always playing Oscars' somewhat pretentious dad. And Weaver is appealing as the object of our young hero's misguided affection.One thing that's rather refreshing about Tadpole is that it only runs 79 minutes.

It's low-budget and not a long film, but shortly after it began I found myself smiling through every one of its 80 minutes. Okay, perhaps it is not realistic for a 15 year old boy to be smitten by a 40 year old woman, or for a 40 year old woman to brag openly to her friends about her seduction of him, but it's just fun to watch. (However, 9 years after the film release a 40 year old school teacher, who was arrested due to her affair with a 15 year-old student of hers, had the charges dropped after the two married in 2010.)Tadpole is a nickname that 15 year old Oscar (played perfectly by then 24 year old Aaron Stanford) thinks he's outgrown. Nobody calls me that anymore, he tells the doorman at his father's New York swank apartment building. But it is also a metaphor for how he appears to a coterie of 40+ women who he intrigues. Oscar's divorced mother is French so he is fluent in French as well as English. He prefers the pleasure of reading Voltaire, both for Voltairs's wisdom and his satire, rather than to listen to pop music or other interests of the average teenager. Oscar is bright, sophisticated beyond his years, and finds girls at his boarding school (who are attracted to him like moths to a flame) to be vapid and boring. Instead he is infatuated with Eve (Sigourney Weaver, who at 51 in 2000, looked a bit old for the part) his 40 something stepmother. Not to give away too much, but Eve's friend Diane (Bebe Neuwirth) has a major part of the action. Neuwirth won awards for her performance in this film.Tadpole deserves to be seen by more people. It's rating in TV movie reviews is too low. "},{"Title":"Mum's the Word","Date":"14 October 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Tadpole made a splash at Sundance, announcing the arrival of Gary Winick. But after Tadpole provided him with a ticket to the mainstream, Winick showed a predilection for blander, more middling material. The increasingly dire likes of 13 Going On 30, Charlotte's Web, Bride Wars and Letters to Juliet. This dreary, undistinguished career would have probably continued until it was suddenly cut short when Winick succumbed to brain cancer earlier this year.Tadpole was quite risqué for the normally conservative Winick, and the one shining light in an otherwise throwaway career. You have to wonder what it was about Tadpole he got right that he managed to get wrong on everything else. And when a theme is a teen being romanced by a woman twice his age, something bound to raise the eyebrows of more than a few in an audience, Winick's accomplishment seems all the more remarkable. Winick seemed to fancy himself a Martin Scorsese or a Steven Spielberg. Someone with the capacity to take on any genre regardless of what it was. Kid films, rom-coms, fantasy. Tadpole seemed to be Winick's attempt at a Woody Allen movie. Tadpole lacks the same introspection, but compared to everything still ahead for Winick, its a gem.Oscar Grubman (Aaron Stanford) is visiting his parents in New York for Thanksgiving. He's got all the girls swooning over him, but he's only got eyes for Eve. She's smart, classy, sophisticated. Everything he wants in a woman. She's perfect except for one pesky detail. She's his stepmother! Oscar hasn't even finished prep school yet, and just sees the age barrier as a hurdle to surmount.While his father Stanley (John Ritter) tries to set Oscar up with every teen girl on the Upper East Side, things spiral out of hand when Oscar falls into bed with Eve's best friend Diane (Bebe Neuwirth, delightful). She's quick to brag about it, while Oscar tries to sort out mixed emotions before Thanksgiving dinner.There's a scene in Tadpole when Oscar is described as having the soul of a man in a teen's body. Gary Winick later conducted a gender reversal on that idea, to far blander effect in 13 Going On 30. Tadpole was one film where Winick pulled everything together. Since he never pulled off that trick a second time, I suspect it was more to do with the excellence of the cast, and having such a witty script at his disposal.Admittedly Tadpole makes things easier on itself by having a male teen (instead of a teen girl) caught in a love triangle with two older adults. Aaron Stanford is also too old to credibly play a teenager. But the script is deft the way it deals with Oscar's romantic entanglements. Part of the reason for this is because scriptwriters Heather McGowan and Niels Mueller place Oscar at the centre of a marvellous triptych of conflicting adults.Eve, Diane and Stanley are all well defined. Sigourney Weaver gives Eve a great injection of class. Its obvious why Oscar loves her so, even if she is his stepmother! John Ritter plays Stanley with perfect indifference to the insane situation going on around him. But the performance that lights up the film comes from the vastly underrated Bebe Neuwirth.Its great for the way Neuwirth walks a fine line between spicing up her love life and committing such a reprehensible act. Diane doesn't mind sleeping with a teen, who showed interest in a woman her age. Granted he was drunk at the time but Diane can live with that! What amazed me more than anything about Tadpole is that for such a potentially squeamish topic, and something Winick never managed with the far safer Bride Wars or 13 Going On 30, is that the film is funny in spite of that.I did find it difficult to believe that Diane would want to boast to the girls in her age range about Oscar, but Neuwirth's obvious delight at watching the situation snowball into a sublime comedy of errors is joyous. It all blossoms into one wonderful scene in a NY restaurant, where Oscar, Eve, Stanley and Diane are at dinner together. Weaver's sobering intelligence, Ritter's condescension and Neuwirth's glee at Stanford's discomfort play off of one another superbly. The one thing that lets the film down is a bland visual scheme. Tadpole was made extremely low budget, and to tell you the truth it shows. The film looks like its being captured through the lens of a camcorder, but not like cinema verite. I think that was all they could afford on the budget they had at hand, but because the actors are working from such a terrific script, that's enough to carry Tadpole over the rough spots.Another plus is Winick is content to let the actors lead the show without too much interference from him. He just lets them tell the story without resorting to obvious signposting. Something that seemed to escape him on Charlotte's Web and Bride Wars. The nearest it ever gets to that is the constant quotations from Voltaire. I'm not sure the film needed these because they tend to get in the way of the narrative, and what with only a running time of 78 minutes, they feel more intrusive than informative.Still, Tadpole is a film of surprising charm. It never does resolve the dilemma it sets up for itself, and Oscar is more naive than he likes to believe. I also would have preferred an extended running time, and it works better as comedy than it ever does as drama, but Tadpole is winning, sharp and very insightful. Something you can never say again about a Gary Winick movie.

Never has a truer word been spoken and this film would have saved itself by paying heed. The basic plot concerns an overly intelligent and smugly sophisticated 15 year old Oscar Grubman (Aaron Stanford) and an infatuation with his much older stepmother, Eve (Sigourney Weaver). No prizes for guessing which 1967 Mike Nichols film this is styled on.One drunken night, Oscar bumps into Eve's best friend, Diane (Bebe Neuwirth), a similarly older lady. Diane seizes her opportunity and seduces Oscar like the classic cougar that she is through the guise of wearing a scarf and perfume that remind Oscar of his stepmother. Now, it should be duly noted that if you're a 15 year old guy with a fetish for the older woman, then said older woman could not take any better form than that of Diane when played by Ms Neuwirth. However, the overall plot is not a challenge and distinctly lacks any sense that it might actually be going somewhere until the last ten minutes. Importantly, the last ten minutes turn out to be just as disappointing as the rest of this film.The only pillars of strength for 'Tadpole' are the performances turned in by Bebe Neuwirth and John Ritter. Their time on screen manages to break the monotony of what is otherwise a drab and disengaged motion picture. It says a considerable amount about a film when an actress of Sigourney Weaver's caliber fails to resonate or lift the tone, as even she appears bored at times.The characters seem wholly underdeveloped and the interesting ones appear to drop off the face of the earth almost as quickly as they were shoved onto it. Eve, as Oscar's stepmother could have been an interesting version of the love interest but her limited time on screen leaves a vague and insipid impression of the character. Oscar is an acceptable protagonist, but given that the film deals with a rich topic for storytelling, he is also somewhat disappointing for a male lead with what could have been an excellent show and tell of the Oedipus Complex. The fact that Aaron Stanford is evidently older than his character's 15 years has not gone amiss with either the scriptwriter or the director as the supporting cast constantly reminds the viewer that he is indeed older than he seems, in more ways than one.As John Ritter puts it during the dinner sequence, incidentally the best scene in the film, it's all very The Graduate. Indeed it is, minus the finesse. Crammed with embarrassingly clichéd musical dream sequences, that would quite frankly make Rodgers and Hammerstein seem like a welcome addition to any film collection, we have before us a disastrous attempt to make a Graduate-esque teenage crush appear facetious. Winnick has failed to provide an attention grabbing look at Oscar's dilemma, instead eliciting the comical whimsy of the protagonist's daydreams to the point of exaggerated (and plain bad) slapstick. Overall, 'Tadpole' suggests that it could have, should have and would have been better had Winnick been prepared to put some oomph into the production. It's a shame to see actors of Weaver's, Ritter's and Neuwirth's ability being wasted on shoddy production values and lazy attention to pulldown's and video field capacity. The result is a half-baked comedy that is watchable (tenacity spanning) but at times lacking in passion. Very disappointing ultimately.

Voltaire is no coincidence Candide is Oscar in parts. Oscar wants the ideal - just in this case the ideal is Eva - his stepmother.A lot of this works because of the characterization and chemistry - Oscar fins himself caught in others' webs, but is somehow a good mix of mature and innocent that works well.All in all a nice effort, it never really bites and thus given the material and nature of the film fails to really skewer the comedy and ends up almost a nostalgic look at how 15 year old boys wish love could have been.Funny in parts and wistful this is a nice film about adult relationships.

His role was honest, childish, and playing around the poles. Between his disinterest for ignorant teenage girls and childlike attraction for older, more mature women, he is downright brilliant. An adorable role, and the actor does it much justice. The fact that the movie is short helps the plot, it does not allow it to become overly heavy and somber, lets it play along the edges.

It was at this point, about 15 or 20 minutes into the movie, that I could not take anymore.I have seen other films shot in Digital Video, and it is clear from the quality of shooting here that the Director and Cameraman knew nothing about how to shoot in this medium. The worst consequence of the awful camera work was the unflattering photography of Bebe Neuwirth, one of the true babes of pop entertainment.

(Indeed, the graininess and the occasional time you notice the movements of a handheld camera do nothing to advance the movie - they just make it look cheap.) At least the DV in this didn't alienate me from the setting as much as it did in films like Vidocq and Star Wars Episode II.As far as films about teenage boys falling for older women go, Wes Anderson's 'Rushmore' is clearly better than 'Tadpole'. However I'll give you two reasons to see Tadpole, and both of them are very strong reasons.(1) The dinner scene in the restaurant. In Rushmore's restaurant scene, the protagonist is being utterly obnoxious to the point that the scene isn't amusing, but Tadpole's scene is classic comedy. Who knows what? Who suspects what? The lies are woven and stumbled over, the looks are exchanged, and the scene is far and away the funniest in the film.(2) Bebe Neuwirth - absolutely perfect in this role, sexy, sly, vampish, she gives the most devilish looks throughout. If you're like me, you'll want to smack Oscar for not seeing the forest for the trees - he gets drunk and has sex with Diane (Neuwirth) while drunk, then regrets it and wants nobody to find out, as he continues to lust after Eve (Sigourney Weaver) ... come on, man! Neuwirth (in this film, anyway) is far sexier than Weaver, and even sexier than the pretty young thing from Oscar's school).Some devices used in Tadpole work, and some don't. The doorman at Oscar's father (John Ritter)'s swanky apartment building is a cheesy way of tracing the progress in the film in his three scenes, his conversations with Oscar go from blunt to friendly and, so obvious it's somewhat offensive, the doorman goes from not opening the door for Oscar at all, to closing it behind him, to opening it and closing it for him. Actually, this wouldn't be such a bad concept if not for the fact that Oscar hasn't really changed at all - he's still pretentious, single-minded, inattentive, and somewhat annoying to the audience (as he passes up both beautiful and more homely girls his own age, as well as a beautiful 40-year-old, to relentlessly pursue his stepmother). So if Oscar hasn't changed, why are the doorman's interactions with him changing?! While I mention it, lusting for one's stepmother could be seen as a semi-legal Oedipal complex of some sort, but the film never comes close to exploring the roots or possible meanings of this.Devices that do work the recurring song She and the Alice in Wonderland statue. The latter appears only briefly, but it's not very subtle - Diane (Neuwirth) finishes a sentence, and then in the silence her eyes lead you right to the statue. Both the song and the statue hold contextual meaning rather than contentual, so their effect on you depends on your knowledge of them - they'll either be meaningless, or flatter your intellect. She, which most of us associate with Elvis Costello, was actually written by a young man lusting after Edith Piaf, who was much older than he. 'Alice in Wonderland' was written by a middle-aged man (Lewis Carroll) about and for a very young girl for whom he is romoured to have held amorous affections. In this light, the song's connection to Oscar's love for Eve and the statue's connection to Diane's relationship with Oscar are obvious.Overall, I cannot hate this film, because it was well acted, it made me laugh once or twice, and it had some nice, thoughtful touches. (It also made me want Bebe Neuwirth, but that's none of your business.) However, the film doesn't go beyond cute, as it doesn't explore any of the issues it brings up at all. It even neglects to show the most bare-bones social implications of relationships that border on statutory rape after Diane's relations with Oscar are revealed, Eve has one - largely inconclusive - discussion with Diane, and then almost all of the supporting characters, Diane included, seem to drop off the face of the earth for the rest of the film. The film is only 70 minutes long, which seems awfully short, but when you see that the filmmakers refuse to get any more philosophical than the light humour of the Voltaire quotations used to divide the sections of the film, you will actually applaud the decision to not drag it on any longer.I should add that Oscar's schoolmate is my favorite character after Diane. Although he goes to the same private school as Oscar, this young man has none of Oscar's pretentiousness. He plays with a basketball, he warns Oscar to stay away from his mother, and he hopes Oscar will go out with the hot girl from school so that he can get introduced to her friends. At the same time, he's not nearly as one-dimensional as typical teenaged movie males - he has an ability to read his friend that is normally reserved for female characters. A small role, but well written and realistically delivered (no overacting).7/10 "},{"Title":"A different upscale urban teen movie.","Date":"25 February 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  Tadpole is an upbeat sophisticated little comedy that has more than a ring of truth to it.

If you can't relate to that, then you won't like this movie.After watching two just-released movie with big-name stars, in which the adult characters couldn't express themselves without using four-letter words and weren't able to deal with their lives in a mature, competent manner, I was ready to swear-off contemporary movies and look for David Niven and Cary Grant.  Thank goodness, I gave Tadpole a try.Oscar, known as Tadpole when he was younger, is a fifteen-year-old with a forty-year-old approach to life.  He is still a fifteen-year-old in many respects, and the movie does a great job of balancing that fact with his intellectual and mature mentality.  Although some who have seen the movie consider Oscar's brief encounter with an older woman a form of child abuse, there was nothing in Oscar's character to make him a victim.  Fifteen was just his chronological age.  If you want a movie in which the main character can express himself without swearing, likes Voltaire, has deep feelings involving unattainable love, and deals successfully with it in the end, this may be a movie that you will enjoy.

In many ways, the film was reminiscent of French movies which combine sexuality with ideas, where the ideas undergird the film.  Winick seems comfortable with the reality that families, especially blended ones, are often cauldrons of seething sexuality.  These passions run like a swift underground river, oblivious to the egos and social conventions that rule the surface.  In the hands of lesser actors, the material would have crumbled into camp, but this experienced cast delivers the discourse at the level of tender, light comedy, with a deep respect for the characters and issues involved.  Oscar (Aaron Stanford) is the precocious 15 year old son of a Columbia history professor, Stanley (John Ritter), and has a mad crush on his step-mother Eve (Sigourney Weaver).  Disdaining girls his own age as lacking in the worldly graces and wisdom,  he focuses instead on Eve, a doctor whose passion for her work and interest in him ignites his passion for love, relationship, and self-discovery.  Toting his tirelessly read copy of Voltaire's Candide, he seeks a sensibility in a woman to nurture his hunger for the world that is beginning to open to him.  So, during a brief vacation from his prep school, he charges ahead with a plan to finally connect romantically with his step-mother.  After an awkward evening with the fam, he ventures out to the cool evening air to drop off a girl his father wants him to date, ditches her in a cab (But I only live six more blocks away, she protests) gets drunk, and runs into Eve's friend Diane (Bebe Neuwirth), a chiropractor who invites him into her apartment and, with one thing leading to another, gives him an adjustment he will never forget.  Since she is a friend of the family, Oscar is appalled to learn that Eve has invited her to attend dinner with the family.  And then, the hi-jinx begin.  Or they would in a lesser film, but here, the filmmaker treats the situation with wry humor, a keen understanding of adolescence and the feelings that emerge when the rule book no longer applies because those chapters have never found print.  During the rest of the film, with a surprisingly light touch, it proceeds to describe how the characters resolve these eruptions of passion, and find a way to channel them in a way that is consistent with the developmental course of the family.      While the film is slight in some respects, it works well when taken on its own terms.  The writing is sharp and closely observed, and the characters are realistically drawn.  To the filmmakers' credit, he lets us grapple with the issues he raises without creating scapegoats.  This film savors the ambiguity of the characters who inhabit its plot, which allows us to relate to them in a way that permits us to grapple with ourselves.  And, of course, the movie suggests another compelling social issue......how would we feel if the protagonist were a 15-year- old girl?  I should also add that Tadpole resonates with the look and feel of the coming-of-age films from a generation earlier, with Oscar's character somewhat reminiscent of Benjamin Braddock of The Graduate.  Winick also uses a cover of a Simon and Garfunkel song, along with the David Bowie rock classic Changes.  By using this retro-score, Winick succeeds in not only referencing a film vocabulary, but also unearthing the feel of an era, where life pushed the edge of the envelope, anyone under the age of 30 who was not a revolutionist was considered an inferior (Shaw), and life effused with possibilities.   The only fault I found with the film was its digital cinematography, which looked washed out with ill-defined images, a problem that would not have occurred disappeared with the use of film stock.  Nevertheless, I'm happy to give this film ***1/2 of fours stars.

Tadpole is the story of Oscar (played by newcoming Aaron Stanford) and his Oedipus complex for his stepmother, Eve, (played by Sigourney Weaver).  Oscar comes back from boarding school for Thanksgiving on a mission to express his romantic affections for Eve.  However, it takes him time to find the right moment for this to happen, and one evening, Oscar is diverted by one of his stepmother's friends, Diane (played by Bebe Neuwerth) who seduces him.  Diane and Oscar have sex and it begins a hillarious farce, where Oscar attempts to hide their one-night encounter from his stepmother, whom he loves.The inspiration for Tadpole seems clearly to be Woody Allen.  The look and feel of New York, the witty and punchy dialogue, the kind of New Yorkers that they characterize, and of course the Allen-stepdaughter relationship, all scream out that this is a homage to Woody Allen.  Even the handheld camera movements and the Manhatten party scenes have a Woody Allen flair.The ability of the film to enter this Woody Allen-esqe world was crucial for me, because I gave the same leeway to this film as I do for Woody Allen's films.  I don't expect minority actors, nor do I expect to see moderate or low-income people.  And, above all, I don't expect to see reality; only a slightly warped reality.Another crucial aspect of the film is the performance of young Aaron Stanford.  Stanford's preparation for his portrayal of this character is outstanding.  Stanford's Oscar finds the perfect tone of a boy who believes his is much older than his physical age.  He adopts debonair mannerisms that remind you of how Cary Grant and Humphrey Bogart used to establish their presence on screen; like the slight cocky turn of the head and shoulders and the winning grin.  He also does well, intellectualizing Voltaire and other classical writers.  Stanford carries a large part of the film and I was glad to watch him.Sigourney Weaver, Bebe Neuwirth and John Ritter turn in good performances.  However, the film does not give them a great deal of time to explore their characters.  At one hour and eighteen minutes, the film moves quite expeditiously.  The film could have found a bit more depth with such a strong cast.Overall, I enjoyed Tadpole and recommend it.  My rating is *** (3 stars) out of **** / or 7.5 out of 10.  "},{"Title":"A triumph of restraint and good taste","Date":"28 August 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" (Spoilers)Fifteen-year-old Oscar of `Tadpole' is a sophisticated New York preppy, like Holden Caulfield.  He's seduced by his mother's best friend, like Dustin Hoffman in `The Graduate.' His dominance of his world and his complicated existence recall Max Fischer in Wes Anderson's `Rushmore.' The Upper East Side world of civilized young white people very much suggests Whit Stillman's films, especially `Metropolitan.'  But Tadpole isn't a pastiche. It's a lighthearted and stylish treatment of the old theme of a young boy coming of age through sexual experimentation with older women. As can happen, the excellent Aaron Stanford, who plays young Oscar, is 23, not 15; and his stepmother, Eve, Sigourney Weaver, who ought to be fortyish, is ten years older. They make up for this  Stanford's face can look old and sad, but more often is boyishly innocent; Weaver is plenty sexy, as great looking as ever, and also comes across as very kind.  Bebe Neuwirth as Diane, the best friend, who does the actual seducing, is sly and attractive and has a slightly brassy quality that never goes too far.  In fact what makes `Tadpole' so good is its restraint.  (Oscar tells his father to listen to silences and realize what's not said is important.)The dialogue in `Tadpole' isn't as cool and epigrammatic as Whit Stillman's &#150; in this story there's really only one witty person -- but Oscar's lines are precocious without being too clever.  He's appealing because he's decent and polite, a good person as well as intelligent and preternaturally self-possessed.  The story is a bit like what might happen if one of Stillman's autobiographical young men set out (at an early stage) to seduce his stepmother.  It's just as well that he doesn't succeed.  The movie is about a stage rather than an event.It's true that Gary Winick's `Tadpole' wants to be a bit more sophisticated than it is. (Maybe it didn't have time to with Digital Video, $150,000, and two weeks of shooting time.)  The glamour of uptown Manhattan is almost strong enough to counteract the grainy images; but young Oscar's showoff of French at Boulud may not impress a Francophone audience. His best pal from Chauncy Prep is played by Robert Iler, Tony Jr. in `The Sopranos' and not exactly a prince of suave.  But Oscar (Stanford) is articulate and sensitive and poised enough to convince that he does indeed, for this moment, prefer older women and have the ability to seduce them.  All his conversations with stepmother Eve are charming  the climactic incestuous kiss is presented with wonderful taste and restraint. What young heterosexual man at this stage of his life would not lust after, and fall more than a little in love with, an attractive stepmother?  The epigraphs from Voltaire are very right for a movie about a precocious boy they're not brilliantly apposite, they're part of Oscar's pretension.  (Such epigraphs so often are hopelessly pretentious without the filmmaker's meaning them to be.)  Robert Iler as the buddy gets to be down to earth  `You want to sleep with your MOM?'  John Ritter gets to be the dim dad (even though he's a college professor), but as tact prevails here, there's nothing of the caricature about him.Perhaps the movie's greatest limitation of perspective is that it's a bit too admiring of Oscar.  It might be much better if he appeared to us boyish or jejune at times instead of always scoring in conversation and seduction without flaw.  The power of `The Graduate' was partly the sense of latent terror Hoffman conveyed, but Aaron Stanford never falters &#150; nor does he seem foolhardy  he embodies in superabundance the movie's perfect tact.  In short, he's too perfect.  But the fact that everybody's exemplarily nice in `Tadpole' and nobody gets hurt is what allows this movie to be lighthearted fun and end as a brief episode &#150; a great drama only in its hero's mind and soon over, as suits a 15-year-old's life, rather than turning, inappropriately, into a `dangerous liaison' whose amoral excess leads to tragedy.`Tadpole' has had great distribution luck &#150; Sundance luck &#150; and has received a lot of press and great audience exposure.  But it's a mistake to see this movie as succeeding because it appeals to some kind of special arthouse, inde taste.  The movie has been lucky, but it's also a classic story, it gives pleasure, and it's very well done.  Was `Harold and Maude,' to which `Tadpole' is being compared, some kind of art house-inde thing?  No, it was just a phenomenon.  People discovered it and they liked it.  `Tadpole' could give everybody in it a big boost, particularly the younger actors.

Thank goodness for the recent `Lovely and Amazing,' in which the older woman is charged with statutory rape.Director Gary Winick's `Tadpole' is not as energetic as `The Graduate' or as funny as `Rushmore,' but its charm comes from its low-key attitude toward transgressive sex without consequence.

If you're more into fast-paced, visually appealing Hollywood comedy, this may go too slow for you, even with its extremely short running time.

Ways that are thoughtful and engaging; ways that ask us to rethink the world and our morals in new shades. No, Tadpole isn't revolutionary, but it really reminded me to proceed through life with passion, and to start skimming the internet for scantily clad photos of the lead actor.The only thing I hate about Tadpole is the nauseatingly pretentious flashcards with Voltaire quotes. Every other scene, the filmmakers interrupt the story with a truly obnoxious sample of Voltaire's writing that happens to compliment whatever just happened to the characters.Barf-A-Go-Go! Talk about pandering! Those imbecilic flashcards are the signature of filmmakers who aren't fully confident in their own observations. They're trying to impress us with what they know as opposed to the unfolding events of a good story. What a horribly amateurish display of bad taste! If Voltaire had made his living through techniques so outstandingly mid-brow, history never would have remembered him.But on the whole, Tadpole rocks the casbah. So boo on utahfilmmaker! He's wrong!

A well thought out story. It is not a porn type movie and only french kissing was really played, and there was no nudity at all in the movie. That being said, it is given a positive rating here, because it is a well-thought out drama involving a socio-sexual taboo. It's rated higher because it's a good movie for debate and discussion on sexuality as a whole, and the other features I stated above.What really drives this movie is the socio-sexual taboo of a teenage boy and 40 year old women in romantic interactions. It is natural for a teenager to want to explore their sexuality - which makes them vulnerable to sexual predators - and perhaps this movie shows that these predators do not have to be a sick old male psycho going after a school girl, but could be any female. If it were a sex addicted 40 year old man going after a 15 year old school girl, this movie would have been banned.

The first time I saw it I called it sort of a combination of Shaw's 'Candida,' the Phaedra legend and 'Lolita' with the genders reversed, and I stand by that. This time around it was nice to be reminded of how exciting and sensual an actress Bebe Neuwirth could be when all I'm seeing of her these days is the hard-as-nails prosecutor in Law and Order Trial by Jury, and John Ritter's performance is one of the ones he should be remembered by even though his presence makes one wonder why the movie wasn't called Eight Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Son. (Actually Ritter's best big-screen performance ever was as the President of the United States in the woefully underrated satire Americathon, one movie I'd dearly love to see reissued on DVD.) Just two elements of Tadpole that bothered me how did someone who looked so young get into that bar (I suspect the real Aaron Stanford gets carded all the time!); and why did a pretentious intellectual kid who prided himself on his fluency in French read Voltaire in translation instead of the original?

Tadpole takes every hackneyed theme from freshman English (and, presumably, Film Studies) and dresses them up with established actors (Bebe Neuwirth, Sigourney Weaver, John Ritter) who should all fire their agents for letting them touch this with a ten-foot pole. The soul-crushing banality of the tropes employed (Oscar daydreaming about frolicking in the park with Eve, Oscar gazing wistfully into the distance over the water, exposition and plot advancement wrought via Oscar's conversations with the doorman of his Manhattan apartment building) is matched only by the startlingly bad dialogue (Oscar opines that the girls in high school seem like they haven't lived very much, and says of the latinate terminology of cardiac medicine, It's poetry!). In addition, as another reviewer here mentions, the love interest around which the movie revolves is completely baffling and unmotivated--we never learn anything about Eve, except that she wears slinky dresses and red scarves and feels like there's something missing.  There's something missing, all right--any reason at all to watch this movie.Ritter and Neuwirth put in good performances, despite the sub-par material they have to work with. But on the whole the cast is flat-flooted together, and the action of the movie is irritatingly broken up by epigrams from Voltaire whose wit and wisdom are in marked contrast to the lack of inspiration that pervades the entire film.

Nonetheless, I never really pay heed or put much weight in what passes through the Sundance gauntlet.  In fact, much of what is critically lauded is downright depressing at times!  i.e. Better Luck Tomorrow, etc.Nevertheless, I must state for the record that I picked up this DVD earlier today (at the price of a NYC theater ticket) and watched it twice in the last handful of hours--the second round for the director's commentary.  (I tend to eschew films in theater that appear sketchy in previews or clips even if they feature some of my most celebrated actors.)Tadpole's DV (digital video) format is similar to that of Better Luck Tomorrow in that it has the look of a low budget film--which they both are; however, the constant jerking of the handheld cameras is less noticeable than the overall picture graininess and horrible lighting/sound.  For lovers of commentaries, don't expect much from this one.  All throughout the movie, Winick inculcates the viewer with many points of (dis)interest by revealing to the audience the technical flaw of too many a scene.  This is fine if you're unfamiliar with the trials and tribulations of directing/producing but, it's not particularly fascinating when you're more interested in hearing plotholes justifications et al.  The ramblings were lackluster as a whole, but the highlight of the commentary was an insightful explanation of particular camera views that were used during one of the best scenes in the entire movie (dinner in the restaurant).My problem with the movie itself isn't so much with the technical aspect... but the storyline has a recycled feel to it with the inclusion of plenty of fluctuations in energy.  (I'll explain in a few.)  Although this movie deals with the complex notions of love and relationships, it only grazes the surface of what it's all about seeing as how Oscar's love is quite superficial; what else I find irksome is that so many of the illogical bits that lack illuminating remain unexplained even *during* the commentary! The philosophical nature of the film would have gained substance had the quasi-Greek Tragedy (Oedipal) tie been expounded upon.  Plus, the film isn't at all paced consistently nor is it a quasi-realistic coming of age piece. Perhaps that's part of its charm... the blatant neglect for law and other consequences.  Statutory rape anyone?So what makes this movie so worthwhile?For all of its flaws... three actorsBebe Neuwirth is more than a delight to watch and moves the film along when it drags its feet.  Her expressions, improv, overall comedic nuances, and timing are impeccable for her scenes.  The fact that she disappears for the latter part of the movie is somewhat of a disappointment.  While her scintillating presence is missed, Sigourney Weaver fills in the holes for the most part giving a solid performance as Oscar's stepmother, Eve.  She brings enough heartfelt warmth, humanity, and dignity to the role to make up for the misused John Ritter and gives the movie a more down to earth feel regardless of the inanity taking place.  Aaron Stanford, making his debut as a film star, does an admirable job with his first role; his aplomb while delivering well-timed lines (however obnoxious and irreverent) and natural reactions compensate for the skewed disposition of his character later on.Note I realize that there's only so much an actor--no matter how talented--can do especially when the characterization or plot is limited by the writer(s).  In the case of this film, if anything seems amiss, it would have to be the fault of the writers/producers/director.  Without the chemistry between these actors, the sardonic wit, irony, and comedy of great moments such as the restaurant scene would have fallen through the cracks. The ending may have been bathetic more than fulfilling in terms of giving the audience proper closure, but you too can make the most of this movie by relishing the three excellent performances and little else.

The tension builds (or tries to build), until finally she does reveal it. However, nobody seems to care very much. Tadpole's father and step-mother express some surprise and there are some discussions about it between the step-mother and her friend, but the impact is very muted. Why was it written this way? Because they placed the cheap laughs before the plot. This would be fine if it were a comedy, but it seems to take itself very seriously.

Applying intellect to his problem, he does not believe there are any obstacles that are insurmountable, and the consequent aspirations and revelations make for a wonderful story. Comparisons with The Graduate are inevitable, but this is a story of romantic love and there are no explicit sex scenes. As a coming of age tale it is remarkably mature, and storyboard quotations from Voltaire, peppered through the movie, keep pulling the audience back to central questions and philosophical &#145;solutions'. Shot entirely on DVD, the film has associated highs and lows of the medium. The colours of Central Park are not quite as spectacular as could be achieved in 35mm for instance, but the ability to shoot a major movie on a budget of $150,000 (a figure quoted by the Director at its European premiere in Edinburgh August 2002), the spontaneity of being able to re-shoot a scene on the spur of the moment, and maybe the fact that a small camera is less intrusive when seeking finely shaded responses by the actors, all make a telling testament to the power of DVD.

She needs to be in more films and  more major roles.  She basically carried this film for me, because it does have some  rough patches, I will get to later. What is written on the videotape when I rented it is much different than what I was  expecting. I was expecting more of a Rushmore type film...when the plot came to Oscar  liking her stepmom over Neuwirth's character Diane (ok, tell me how thathappens...since Bebe Neuwirth is super hot,) it became a funnier version of the movie  Spanking The Monkey. The video box and promos act like Oscar likes ALL older women,  giving it a funnier idea than it actually has. It was, however, funnier to me than  Rushmore.The underage theme didn't bother me. Then again, I liked the film and book of Lolita  too. I can see it is just a film, but I am sure things like this happen in real life too. I knew  17 year olds that were dating 25 year olds in high school.  It isn't impossible to imagine  a mature 15 year old attracted to older women.I wasn't quite convinced that Oscar would choose his stepmother, played by Sigourney  Weaver, over Bebe Neuwirth.  It might be my personal opinion, but Diane seems full of  life and gusto, while Eve, his stepmother, is at the most, mousy and incomplete. I know  that is that whole plot line how Eve is missing something and Oscar could be it, but that  falls flat for me.I know that loving your stepmom isn't incest, but it was creepy. The way it was dealt  with the issue in the movie was simple and realistic. I appreciated that Eve didn't tell  Oscar's dad about it. What was strange for me was that when Diane admits she slept  with Oscar, his dad doesn't really care about it. I could see a stepmother not really  caring, but wouldn't a dad think there was something wrong with it...or is it totally ok in  our culture for underage kids to sleep with older people in relationships? None of that  was actually addressed.  In fact, Ritter's character doesn't react to anything around him  and maybe that is the point of the character and why Oscar is so smart...all that time  without dad=a lot of reading of philosophy...as if the character is looking for a dad in  words. Still, the characters act like it is all ok.  Was Oscar a virgin at the time?  He  doesn't say one way or another or say anything to his friend about it.  I just must be old,  but in my day, 15 year olds weren't trying to get laid, like Oscar's friend says. Anyone  agree with me on this one? Or maybe the friend is trying to act older, without knowing  what he is saying?Tadpole does have some funny parts, mainly with Bebe Neuwirth. She breathes life into  this film. I was hoping the scene where Diane introduces Oscar to his friends would have  gone somewhere. It didn't.  I was hoping Neuwirth would have more screen time. She  disappears during the second half of the film.  The scene where she is speaking French  back and forth with Oscar and teasing him is very funny and goes against what the  average boy would do (ie, blab to all his friends) in the situation. It goes against the  stereotype of the randy male teen.It is a sad reality that if this was an underage teenage girl who loved older men, it would  never get made. Not that you don't get the feeling that Oscar is used by Diane and you  can tell he is unhappy with it.  The movie is good at flushing out that mix of feelings  with Oscar.  I do think the video box will draw the wrong crowd to this movie, people  who expect something else, like a rip roaring comedy about a boy courting older  women, when it actually it is a bittersweet comedy drama telling about the frustration  Oscar has in life dealing with his ideal of older women and a crush on his stepmother,  which is taboo.  But in the end, he finds himself at a different place, more apt to deal  with the world. I would recommend this film. It has its funny moments and it runs only 77 minutes,  though it seemed like less to me. If you are a Bebe Neuwirth fan, this is a must see. She  positively sizzles in the role of Diane.

To anyone who complains about the themes - it's a MOVIE, meaning it's not real. There's a thing called willing suspension of disbelief that one engages in when watching a film. Get used to it. It says what its about on the box, if you don't like that, don't buy or rent it. If you aren't a member of the moral majority however, prepare yourself for a fantastic film.

This movie is a coming-of-age story that is packed in less than 80 minutes. The story is refreshing funny without resorting to jokes you've seen before. Its humor comes from situations with its characters that left me asking what's next. Jimmy's protagonist is a very smart high school sophomore that shows passion beyond his year that left me wondering what I can do to look at what's missing in my life. Watch this movie to see something about a smart kid finding out something that any adult will know, and break his liver doing it.

Is it one of the year's best?  No, but not too far off. It certainly is better than Gosford Park and Mulholland Drive and other crap posing as movie gold (I won't even mention big budget flicks). Tadpole tackles familiar, yet still interesting subject matter, and mines it fairly thoroughly and cleverly, even if new revelations are not discovered in the process.  The movie is well made, has some depth, it is written well, acted well, and is funny.Some folks tend to over intellectualize and analyze life, let alone movies. In the same vane, movies that are edgy yet not obscure, ambigious, and downright weird are considered posers.  It seems that Dude, Where's my Car and other mainstream, unadulterated dribble are given more than their due because no one expects anything from them.  Similarly, indie films that are beyond edgy, obscure, confusing, and basically a muddled mess, are considered revolutionary, ground-breaking, multilayered masterpieces just because they are different, take chances, and no one has the guts to admit they don't get them, which must mean they're meaningful!  This akin to staring at a blank canvas and pondering it's genius.  The artist may believe in its genius as well.  Nevertheless, it's still a blank piece of canvas.Enough with the rant.  -)  Read the reviews to help guide you.  But ultimately, decide what interests you and see it.  Then make up your own mind.

When combined with a good ensemble cast, the film should have been a true delight.  However, casting a 25 year-old actor to play the 15 year-old lead character was a fatal flaw.  The age difference between 25 year-old Aaron Stanford (Oscar) and 17 year-old Robert Iler (Charlie) became increasingly problematic as the film progressed.

Despite the the annoyingly perky PR prelude, I totally enjoyed this sophisticated, funny, and endearing flick. Aaron Stanford, a 25 yr. old newcomer, shines as the passionate, voltaire- reading, 15 yr.old Oscar. The acting, particularly Bebe Neuwirth's stellar performance, was effortless, and the writing was crisp and hilarious. The scene in the french restaurant is a total knockout. Overall, it's a subtle examination of the type of preoccupation w/culture, sexuality and education that is unique to New Yorkers.

He doesn't like girls of his own age because they are shallow, and on the course of this complex sexual preference of his, he sleeps with the sensual forty-something friend of his stepmother too. Aaron Stanford is quite good as the lead character. He nicely captures Oscar's apparent innocence mixed with strong desire for older women. Whereas Sigourney Weaver is surprisingly flat and unimpressive as the stepmother. Perhaps she was not a good choice for the role too. I would have preferred Meg Ryan. However, Bebe Neuwirth is brilliant as her friend Diane who has a sexual interest on Oscar. She is fluent, natural and funny. John Ritter also gives a good performance as his father.The film is a low-budget one, shot in about two weeks. And it doesn't get out of that setback. The screenplay is poor. The idea of quoting Voltaire from time to time is disturbing. The music used in the film is poorly chosen (except Paul Simon's Only living boy in New York maybe, though I think it's used in wrong place). Fine acting, the freshness of the story and nice location shots of city landscape makes it a fair film to watch.

It was a real pleasure viewing this movie and nothing at all what I expected I was going to see. Thought it was going to be some cheesy, shallow sex comedy. Than why did I watch it in the first place? Well, I like Sigourney Weaver and quite frankly I was intrigued by the storyline of a 15 year old involved with older women. I was pleasantly surprised. The script was witty and wise instead of being dumbed 'down'! Younger people's sexuality were respected without ignoring and discussing responsibilities real or imagined among elders. Oscar, our '15' year old was played by Aaron Stanford (actually in his early 20's) in his film debut, who was extremely likable as a precocious, Voltaire quoting teen whose eye runs toward the older more sophisticated woman. Sigourney Weaver as Oscar's step-mom is the apple of his eye and it is she that our young protagonist lusts for throughout the movie. Oscar's dad is played by the late John Ritter in one of his very last roles and it's nice to see for a change a regular looking and sounding guy have a wife as sexy and smart as Ms. Weaver! Bebe Neuwirth of TV Cheers fame is around as Ms. Weaver's sexy fun loving friend who winds up bedding a very drunk and confused Oscar. When Ms. Weaver's character finds out what happened and confronts her friend, Neuwirth is quick to point how her and Weaver's character behaved when 'they' were teens. Of course, Weaver's first reaction is the typical, 'oh that's different' but after pondering it for a while, she sees how issues and circumstances can be more complex and messy than at first meets the eye. This is a small scale film that tells it's story wittily and well, with its tongue firmly in cheek. I enjoyed it immensely and will be certain to enjoy repeated viewings.

That seems to be the case with Tadpole.  This movie captures Fall in New York like no other film I've seen.  Even more so than Woody Allen does with his pristine photography, the grainy, washed out look of Tadpole (which a lot of people cite as a negative) actually works for the film.  There is never a doubt that it was all filmed on location. The apartments are cozily cramped just like they are in New York (and these are probably the higher end ones).  There's none of that fake NY look you get in the sitcoms where somehow, a group of twenty-somethings manage to live in a palatial apartment in the BEST neighborhood.  Too bad that reality didn't extend into the rest of Tadpole.  First off, the lead character, Oscar, is an intellectural snob and he's intolerably smug.  There is no way that anyone would tolerate his condescending attitude especially the lovely older women in this movie.  In Tadpole this is supposed to be what makes him so appealing.  About a third of the way through, when I realized that this was how he was going to be portrayed through the movie, I had this impulse to smack the back of his head with something.  Secondly (and most important) if I had been 15 years old and had the blessed opportunity to sleep with a BABE like Bebe Neuwirth, MY GOD...you would've had to have sit on me to NOT tell all my buddies.  This guy Oscar acts mortified about it even though she's totally, way cool with it and wants more.  I kept waiting for him to realize what an idiot he is and grab her. Well, I'd be making arrangements to come home on weekends from school to be with her.  And she wasn't a psycho or anything.  Just a cool, older woman.  That aspect of the movie was totally irrational.  Maybe a different actor might've made more of the role or shown us the complexities.  The rest of the cast is fine (with a special bow to the aforementioned Ms. Neuwirth).  Weaver is (as almost always) very fine.  She is one of the most underappreciated actresses around.  John Ritter is suprisingly good as Oscar's father.  Overall, the movie is a bit of a waste.  But I loved the look and feel of it.  Most New Yorkers will.

I wound up watching this on the recommendation of a friend, and she was right, it wasn't in any way the exploitive trash it appeared to be from the ad. But I probably would have liked it about as well if it had been; at least then it would have been livelier.I think the reason my friend liked this more than I did is she related to the title character. When she was in her early teens she considered herself an adult and was pining after her teachers. Even though I also had an intellectual bent, I don't recall any teachers or adults from my childhood who struck me as either intellectual compatible with me or especially sexy, so I just couldn't connect with the premise. I also had doubts that things could turn out the way they did; it seemed just about as realistic as those teen exploitation movies. But mainly I was just generally bored. The dialog and story and characters just didn't interest me.But my friend loved it, for whatever that's worth. We almost never agree on movies.

I don't think it was a love story so much as a commentary about love; it seemed to me the heavy use of French and French philosopher Voltaire were not so much to allude to the main character's intellect as much as draw attention to the emotional and universal theme of the movie. It was as if the characters themselves did not matter the very short time-frame and lack of explanations for must plot-turns made the plot less believed and important, and emphasized on the concept about love and the inability of reason and logic to deal with it; about how good things are not always found where we want or expect them to, and how sometimes you don't get the good thing after-all, and have to settle for something new.The quotes at the beginning of each episode of the movie were superb, and the music score was excellent. The fact the movie was shot on video and not film was really apparent in well-lit scenes, and was bothersome but didn't ruin the movie. I strongly recommend it, but only for people who can understand the joke.

He should have applied `8 rules not to date his teenage son' to his wife whom Oscar lusts for. Sigourney Weaver, who plays the fixed object of Oscar's desire, has played this type of role before.

The video was too contrasty, the color posterized, the sound just plain bad, and there were no closed captions.
