And unfortunately, but not surprisingly, it was relatively ignored in America.Lili Taylor gives a brooding, glib and haunting central performance as Kathleen Conklin, a New York University grad student who is pulled into an alley and bitten by a seductive female vampire (Annabella Sciorra), from which she emerges uncontrollably drawn into a world of violence and insatiable cravings for human blood. Ferrara's irredeemable urban hell landscape is more immediate and frightening than a million Transylvanias and by contrasting Taylor's addiction to the horrors of the past (war atrocities, the Holocaust) and present (heroine, AIDS), the film has more bite and impact than any fang-bearing, gore or special effects could even attempt to muster up. Nicolas St. John's intriguing philosophical screenplay and Ken Kelsch's gorgeous black and white photography (creating a world solely of light and dark, which is a key element in the plot), are not to be overlooked either.Call it pretentious for the philosophy references (Sarte, Nietzche...) if you want, but this highly intelligent and disturbing low-budgeter is one of the most accomplished and well-thought out horror films I've ever seen. Don't let over-hyped, attention hogging Hollywood productions like BRAM STOKER'S Dracula or INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE keep you from seeing it.

In fact, I can't think of another one quite like it. Abel Ferrara has made some strange and disturbing movies in his time, and this one is as strange and disturbing as any. Lili Taylor ('I Shot Andy Warhol') is brilliant as a troubled, soul searching philosophy student who has an unexpected and life-changing encounter with a mysterious stranger ('Cop Land's Annabella Sciorra). Dark, deep, sometimes blackly humorous, and frequently too obscure for its own good, this can be heavy going at times, but is never less than interesting. Christopher Walken, who did some superb work for Ferrara in his classic 'The King Of New York', has only a cameo here, but what a cameo! Walken is terrific and unforgettable. The rest of the supporting cast includes 'The Sopranos' Edie Falco and (briefly) Michael Imperioli, Paul Calderon ('Girlfight'), and Kathryn Erbe ('Stir Of Echoes'). This is a unique movie that will be appreciated by those with an open mind and preference for difficult viewing. Recommended.

With her desires controlling her turns to Peina for help.A sister film in that both film share a crew, a writer and some of the cast.  The genres are very different but the themes are the same &#150; religion and redemption.  The vampire thing isn't played like it usually is &#150; stakes through the heart etc, these are mentioned but not laboured.  Instead the story is about the origins of sin and the extent it controls us and how we can be redeemed.  It cleverly uses the vampire myth as an allegory for wider human evil &#150; `We are not sinners because we sin, we sin because we are sinners.  We aren't evil because we do evil, we do evil because we are evil'.At times it gets a little heavy &#150; the ending in particular takes some interpretation and the message can be easily misunderstood.  However ignoring the message this also stands up as a great vampire film &#150; the party which turns into a massacre is as good (if not better) then the nightclub opening of Blade, and much more meaningful to boot.  Ferrara is a master director who has never followed the money to blockbusters &#150; here he is in total control of his themes and the film rarely loses focus.  His clever use of music is also good &#150; a blend of all styles.  The theme song feels like it's going to be a 1980's romantic comedy, but this blends straight into hip-hop and others to create a mix that never feels strange &#150; in fact a baseline seems to run under the whole film like a heartbeat.Lili Taylor is on top form as Conklin and commands attention the whole time.  Walken and Sciorra are both good but have less screen time than in the Funeral, however here, as there, they have key lines of dialogue that carry tremendous weight.  Sopranos co-stars Falco and Imperioli are both good but are no more than bit players.  The real stars are Ferrara and writer Nicolas St John, who wrote this and The Funeral after the death of his son.Overall this is a great film that serves up more for thought than for action.  To this end it won't please those expecting a Blade style vampire film but to fans of Ferrara used to his themes this will be very enjoyable.

And the list of attractive concepts are, envelope please Lili Taylor, Christopher Walken, Anabella Sciorra, black and white meta-fictional film, and of course vampires galore! Abel Ferrara has directed other well known movies such as Bad Lieutenant, California, and the Funeral. Of these movies, I mildly recommend the first two but definitely not the third. The Funeral is plain boring and dreary, while the other two entertain by showing the gritty side of human nature.Caution, if you're the type of vampire fan who must have each actor decked out in fangs and yellow contacts, then steer clear of this movie, since it's really questionable whether the characters in THE ADDICTION are actually vampires or are just plain junkies in nice clothes.Lastly, there is a very complex philosophical feel to THE ADDICTION, as Lili Taylor muses about life and death in deep conversations in different venues around New York City a college book store, movie theater, etc. I recommend any philosopher out there to grab THE ADDICTION off the shelves as soon as possible.Speaking of the mid-90's, that short-lived era was a golden age for indie actors like Lili Taylor and Parker Posey. Taylor got a taste of vampire-hood early on in this movie, and fortunately for us, and for the committee, Posey got her fangs in Blade 3, which I was very happy to see happen.

I don't usually enjoy movies shot in black and white, nor artsy fartsy movies, but this one really had something to say of great significance (stated explicitly in the final words of the film), and it was also entertaining (at least I found it to be).I don't agree with the general reviewer's attitude toward the holocaust scenes.  The central message of the film does NOT deny reality to suffering, but explicitly acknowledges it (the fact that the holocaust was real and vampires are not real is entirely beside the point).  Suffering IS real, and is the common thread linking the vampire/addict and the holocaust victim.Has anyone else noticed that the central philosophy of the movie is not nihilism, but nondualism?  How the endless cycle of pain/pleasure (also known as addiction) controls all of us to one extent or another, and how all pleasure takes place against a background of pain -- an endless cycle of suffering for most of humanity?  The film also examines the notion of free will in detail, and ultimately concludes that my will against yours is the cause of much evil.  Nondualism concludes that free will is an oxymoron, and denies reality to the concept of personal volition.  This movie reaches much the same conclusion.Ultimately, the main character's spiritual redemption at the end of the movie demonstrates nondualism, not nihilism (a nihilistic ending would be the suicide or death of the main character in a particular violent fashion). Yet she is redeemed, and realizes that annihilation of self (the ego, will, conflict, separation, addiction, the cause of suffering) is the only true path of redemption.  This is a spiritual, non-dual message.If anyone who hasn't heard of the perspective of nondualism is curious, try your favorite search engine and searching on nonduality and/or advaita.Rating 9/10 "},{"Title":"I loved the Addiction","Date":"6 April 2005","Score":"14 out of 21 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Drama","Review":" I loved this film.

Now I think I understand it a little better; addiction can mean how we are addicted to hurting other people because of our own selfishness. The end struck me as strange - at first I presumed the Christian symbolism must mean something else that I couldn't fathom I suppose I think that people who direct these kinds of films must be entirely nihilistic and not have much time for religion! After some thought I concluded that the only way for Katherine to be redeemed, and for us all to be redeemed is to completely lose our own identity (tying in with Christopher Walken's earlier comment about how one has to blend in and not stick out) - however this is rather too troubling for a girl of little brain such as myself to cope with and I still haven't decided whether I think the end was positive or not! The film's flaw is I think the endless philosophical babble - if one hasn't studied the people Katherine is studying for her course, you will have a hard time keeping up. However the extremely good acting and direction makes up for this. The choice to film it in black and white arguably makes it more disturbing, and the graduation scene is truly scary.

The qualities that Ferrara has going for him, and that he never tires of REMINDING us he has going for him - that he is a maverick, an independent film-maker, and that he is cinematographically competent and able to give his movies a certain visual style - would be estimable if they were combined with any intelligence or with the presence in his head of any idea really worth giving visual and narrative expression to. Unfortunately, no film that Ferrara has ever made has given any evidence of either of these. His scriptwriter on this and almost all his other movies, Nicholas St. John, has regularly provided him with material of strikingly low quality, which Ferrara himself, and the generally top-class group of actors and actresses - Walken, Keitel, Sciorra - with whom he works must then labor as best they can to rescue.Keitel's bravura performance in Bad Lieutenant, for example, is the only reason I can think of for this film's being constantly praised as a landmark and a masterpiece. As a theological drama, it has about as much depth as The Song of Bernadette. And The Addiction displays the same facile, cheap, and cynically opportunistic relation to philosophical ideas as Bad Lieutenant does to religious ones. Anyone who has taken even a serious amateur interest in philosophy will recognize all the philosophical paraphernalia of St. John's script as entirely hokey right from the opening scenes on. (It is an indication of the level of Ferrara's intellectual and moral honesty that he is on record as believing, or as pretending to believe, St. John's ridiculous story that he studied philosophy at Heidelberg, Heidelberg, I suppose, being the kind of place you claim to have studied philosophy at if you want to sound really deep (those Germans, you know)). Nobody on the set appears to have been capable of instructing Lili Taylor in how to pronounce the name Sartre or the actor playing her philosophy professor in how to pronounce the name Nietzsche and, as Jonathan Rosenbaum and other intelligent reviewers have commented, the dialogue woven around this faulty name-dropping is clearly not based on any actual reading in any of these writers but just on puerile juggling with a few images and phrases gleaned from secondary and tertiary sources (the intendedly effortlessly erudite exchanges about anthropology between Lili Taylor and her first student victim about the concept of anthropology - Protagoras, Feuerbach etc. - are in fact the nonsensical result of running down a list of the historical occurrences of the term in some concise encyclopedia of philosophy).The Addiction, in other words, is as irredeemably dumb as US movies about super-clever people - Good Will Hunting etc. - invariably tend to be. Ferrara, maverick as he is or claims to be, thinks and feels no differently about the commodity intelligence than the most vulgar mainstream director. To him as to the peddler of Hollywood trash, intelligence is something that can be ordered up simply by slapping together whatever ingredients are recommended as being the right stuff if you're into that sort of thing. (This betting on heavy reps in these matters is also the reason why US cinematic portraits of intellectual life tend to lag, on average, about thirty years behind the times. The very idea that Satrre and Kierkegaard should be the burning topics of intellectual discussion at the philosophy department of a New York university in 1995 - where any student who took him- or herself even halfway seriously would have been at grips rather with Derrida and Foucault and would have laughed at the mere mention of existentialism - betrays the philosophy of this movie as philosophy for tourists.In short, an unforgivably awful movie - and another reason to shake one's head in wonder at how a relentlessly self-promoting quarter-educated New York hipster like Ferrara has succeeded in hoodwinking such a huge proportion of the cinematic establishment.

Starting with a narrative material that's decidedly pulp, but ennobled by numerous philosophical quotations that are an expert miscellanea of the negative thought of the Eighteenth and Twentieth centuries, the director and his writer Nicholas St. John have built an anguished and tormented interrogation about the presence of the Evil in the world, a movie that instills a real sensation of anxiety and painful participation. Here the myth of vampirism is distorted and re-elaborated in a modern way as a metaphor of the addiction, and in particular of the only addiction that's common to every human being the addiction to evil. The main character comes to the conclusion that humanity is only attracted by sin and cruelty, but the end opens to a way of redemption that comes from the understanding and acceptance of her own condition. Everything is magnificently supported by an exceptional visual apparatus, by a black and white photography inspired by the atmosphere of the expressionism and of the American noirs of the Forties, and by an extremely convincing cast. In conclusion, this is a strange, deeply disturbing movie, that maybe can be judged as dirty, realistic and iper-realistic at the same time in its personal and expressionist poetic of horror, it's a movie about pain, loneliness, addiction, contagion, incommunicability and death, and it's surely one of the most mature examples of horror cinema.

Soon after, she falls victim to an insatiable hunger for blood, much to the concern of her classmate and friend (Edie Falco) and her professors.Though a horror film by technicality, The Addiction is more of a parable on a multitude of things&#x97; the proverbial hole in the soul, the way we use one another, and yes, drug addiction&#x97; really, it's a film about the human condition. Stuffed with highbrow philosophy rhetoric and dialogues about William S. Burroughs, the film is admittedly a bit ostentatious in its philosophical commentary. At the same time, one has to remember that the film is about philosophy students, who are in and of themselves a very small fraction of the populace, and this gaudy display of intellectualist interpretation is standard in academia.Phenomenal black-and-white cinematography works as a fantastic mood-setter here, with Ferrara capturing the grimness of the world (in this case, New York City) enclosing around Taylor. The film has a progressively claustrophobic atmosphere, and the streetside photography of the city is powerful and oppressive. Taylor's performance is incredible and nuanced, with Annabella Scoria as the haunting femme fatale, and Edie Falco and Kathryn Erbe as fellow scholars. Christopher Walken has a minor role as a self-admitting vampire and addict who has learned to cope with the affliction.Overall, this film is a truly unique piece of work. It's rare for philosophy and horror to collide in film, but Ferrara pulls off a class act here. While the philosophical asides are a bit garish, there is still a valid subtext here that is upheld with phenomenal cinematography and great performances from all involved. Ferrara brilliantly captures the pernicious terror of the city, the claustrophobic bubble of academia, and the horror of the human condition. 9/10.

She also tries to grow used to her new lifestyle as a vampire. She begins to neglect her thesis and when she finally is able to finish it, a vampire feeding fest is in order.Accompanied by the philosophy of Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, Heidegger, Sartre, Beckett, and Baudelaire among others, and with gory scenes interlaced with exploitive and cruel images of the holocaust, the film worked. Many people who see it feel that it is about spirituality, but i disagree. If the film were about spirituality, it would have been worked into the plot in a more comprehensive way. I feel that the film is more about the human condition to hate and want to hurt. It's interesting stuff. Check it out if you can find it.

As it suggests in its title, this film takes the vampire genre and innovates it by portraying it as a disease what gives you in a sense, a drug addiction. Rather than some mystical beings what can turn in to bats the characters are people coming to terms with their problems. The film is entirely shot in black & white which I think was a very original step for director Abel Ferrara to take. It signifies that vampires can come out in the day but tend to stick to the dark under bell of New York where sky scrapers and chirpy people are nowhere to be seen. However to compensate for this we have alleyways and ghetto like areas filled with the darkness of night. Conveniently for them in the day. The composition and camera work has a certain simplicity to it which in a way counteracts, creating more depth and allowing us to become familiar with the characters. The characters them selves are deep and ultimately well portrayed. Kathleen Conklin, (played by Lili Taylor) begins as the delicate and unaware being who struggles with her temptation by secluding herself, further moor leading on to her very memorable pinnacle which in deed will stay with you for a while. Not to mention Peina, (played by Christopher Walken) which unfortunately has a smaller part than I would have liked to have seen him in, nevertheless as always his presence is original and wont go forgotten.Overall this is an Art house film, Which uses the stereotypes by going against them. If you like the usual vampire flick this wont be for you, even so if you want to see something original this wont fail to surprise and will stay memorable for many years to come. Without mentioning what happens the climax is shockingly pleasing and very memorable. 10 out of 10 "},{"Title":"Addiction about life","Date":"23 April 2006","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Drama","Review":" What kind of addiction is talked about here.

Writing her essay on the holocaust to show the evil in men she get's deeper involved in the dark side of humanity, until one night a mysterious woman (Annabella Sciorra) appears, assaults her, and tells her to if she is so afraid of being hurt all she has to do is tell her to leave. Katie,being in shock can''t say a word, and with a I didn't think so the mysterious woman bites her in the neck and whispers sinister in her ear, you just wait,and see what happens. After she takes her leave, Katie collapses, and is being hospitalized. The doctors say there is nothing wrong with her physical, besides a small wound in her neck, and she may go home. However traumatized by the incident, Katie noticed that she is starting to change. She can't take bright sunlight anymore, and needs sunglasses for her eyes, she is becoming very cynical about humans and their purpose, but above all,she craves a huge urge. an urge for blood...Ferrara has made a masterpiece here, which is so much more than just a vampire movie. It takes the horror genre out of it's frame, and humanizes it. It shows us the deeper influence of the beast in us all. Although some of the long monologues take some speed out of the film making it slow (Not boring, but slow). It also makes the movie harder to understand for the average movie viewer, and not everyone will like the story.The cast mainly IS Lili Taylor who gives a great performance, and takes one the serious lead very well. A lot of this movies believability rests on her shoulder and she gets away with it. She would almost take the movie if it wasn't for Christopher Walken. His (rather short) performances steals the show in this picture, as he is playing an intellectual vampire called Peina, who tells us about modern vampire-ism, and the addiction that comes with vampire-ism.Peina doesn''t preach about the beastof humanity like Katie, but says that being a vampire is just another way of which you can control. Although giving a good performance and having a strong ending monologue Annabella Sciorra is being acted away by Walken and Taylor.Other notable things is the Cinematography of Ken Kelsch, who creates with use of simply light and shadow a very dark scenery, to the streets of New York that is almost becomes haunting. Together with the score of Joe Delia, and his deep dark tones he uses, he feel this movie has is darker than most new upcoming horror movies have. Abel Ferrara truly has made a great film. Maybe no masterpiece for everyone's likening, but a great film, and worth watching.

His movies have always carried this intellectual philosophic tone, but it remained subtle, abstract; on the contrary, in The Addiction we have a full fledged philosophic dissertation in the shape of a urban vampire movie.Lili Taylor is Kathleen Conklin, a philosophy student who one night is bitten by a mysterious woman (Annabella Sciorra) and her transformation begins. Suffering a terrible hunger, an addiction to blood, she wonders if what is happening to her is either natural or supernatural. Her transformation will have an impact in her life and work as she struggles to finish her final thesis.Sure, with a plot like that the movie is really a case of love it or hate it, specially because it gets over intellectual at times and even borders boredom. The philosophical tone the movie has will probably be labeled of snobby or pretentious, but is really in character, as Lili is truly a pretentious woman and we follow her during her transformation and her realization of life and death. It is a very existentialist movie.The plot is full of metaphors, and in a way, it is more on the lines of Bergman's The Seventh Seal, although in a minor scale of course. The acting is truly impressive, not only Taylor and Sciorra, Christopher Walken makes a small appearance that truly proves his quality as an actor. His performance is outstanding.The beautiful black and white photography is not only outstanding, it is another device to take the audience to a walk on the dark side. The beautiful contrasts between light and shadow are a constant theme through the story, and serve its purpose of showing us the decay of humanity.While not the usual horror movie, The Addiction is a very powerful film that surely will make you think. Sure, it can be boring, redundant and pretentious at times, but this is the type of film that grows on you with time.This movie is truly among Ferrara's best work, and if you are interested in philosophy, it is good to give it a try.

It doesn't particularly add anything new to vampire cinema mythology (it's quite similar to George A.

The cast are good - Taylor has a great remote, impersonal quality as the bloodsucker, justifying her monstrous acts with existentialist quotations, and Walken and Sciorra steal their scenes with great aplomb. It's an art-house movie for sure, but it has at least one great creepy horror movie sequence (the graduation party) and is much more unsettling than your standard teen fangs flick.

Some believe they actually exist, while others find them merely a source of entertainment. I must say I fall strictly into the latter category. It would take me a moment to recall all the vampire films I've sat through. The Addiction however is my latest. Then again, perhaps its unfair to label it a vampire flick.Lily Taylor stars as a women studying for a degree in philosophy. Not only does she study it, but it's her life. It intrigues her, makes the wheels in her head turn. Then one late night, she's bitten by a female vampire (Annabella Sciorra). Only she doesn't see it that way. Believing it was just an attack of a sick twisted woman, she tries to go on with her life. Then she starts getting really sick and her doctor can't find anything wrong with her (and so the story goes). Finally she figures it out - she's a vampire, accepts it - and doing like vampires do - goes about her new found way of life. Anything more than that I can't tell you. Simply because the movie gets bogged down in heavy exposition and lost me.Having only seen one or two other films from Abel Ferrara (the director), I assume 'The Addiction' is meant to be less story and more character study. On that note, it was a fine decision to present this movie in black & white. It adds much needed atmosphere to the proceedings and also takes away from the violence. I would suggest they filmed it in this way for that exact reason. This isn't a horror movie. It's a study in character ... philosophy ... with a large splash of blood. Still with a running time of 82 minutes it felt long. Partly because I didn't understand. Partly because I wasn't entertained. Partly because I felt cheated.The movie box boasts it stars Christopher Walken and Annabella Sciorra, but be forewarned both have no more than five minutes of screen time. I honestly decided to give this film a chance solely because Walken starred. I was given the distinct impression he portrayed a major supporting character and he hasn't popped up yet and I'm past the halfway mark of an eighty-two minute film. When he finally does, it's disjointed, quick and I'm sore ... and the climax turns out to be more funny than scary ... and I'm pretty sure it wasn't intended to be that way. Some people will appreciate 'The Addiction'. Vampire fans or not. However for many reasons, it wasn't my cup of tea and I strongly believe others will feel the same.

The entire concept of vampirism in this movie is itself a metaphor for addiction (alcohol, drugs etc.).And why do I say that? Well, for one thing, it lacks many of the non-addictive parts of vampire lore. A human does not transform into a vampire by just being bitten. The very idea of that is ridiculous, since if that was the case, and just 1 person bit another per day, who then turned into a vampire, who again bit 1 person per day etc., the entire world would be populated solely by vampires in a matter of months.This movie is supposed to depict the descent into drug addiction or alcoholism. When we first encounter the addiction, it (personified by the first vampire in the movie), says Tell me to leave. Say it as you mean it!. This is the drug/alcohol talking. But she can't. This is the ambivalence of the addicts' mind, when she knows that it is leading into descent, yet is unable to resist. After that, the urge just increases, and gets more and more evident.Finally, she goes to see a therapist - personified by another vampire, Peina. This vampire is an passive alcoholic, who has been through what Kathleen has, but now is clean. But the therapy is not helping. When she says What do you want?, and he angrily replies, No! What do YOU want? You came to me!, is the therapist's notion of that she is beyond reach. He then leaves her with her addiction.After that, the abuse grows more and more insane. The feasting is an indicator of a raging addiction beyond control, and it leads us to the last stage - the hospital bed. There, all hope is gone, and death wish ensues. But even there, alcohol/drug manifests itself again in form of the initial vampire, who laconically states According to R. C. Sprouse, we are not evil because we do evil things. We do evil things, because we are evil. We are drug addicts by nature, and there is nothing we can do about it. With this ambivalent comment, we are left without knowing whether death sets in or not.The movie's title, The Addiction, does indeed refer to exactly that, the addiction, and follows an addict from her clean stage to the last stage of substance abuse. If only viewed (or at least solely) as a vampire movie, one would not 'get' the movie's intent.

The rest is a mix between gritty realism and unintended camp. The moments that are supposed to be terrifying suffer from jumbled hand-held camera operating. It seems the idea behind this is to make the audience feel the same way that you would if you were being chased around by a bunch of bloodsucking vampires. The problem, however, is that the combination of both loose editing and horrible camera angles result in many of the supposedly terrifying moments falling flat (Granted, watching actors 'necking' for over an hour and fifteen minutes is somewhat comedic to begin with). The writing is serviceable It hits on some of the cliché vampire stuff while also interjecting some nice attempts at philosophy. But in this film, it's hard to reward good intentions. The same can be said of the director's choice of tone and soundtrack (which really takes away from the subtext of the actor's performances by spelling out 'I can just get high all day.' We get it, Vampires=Junkies). Lili Taylor gives one of those rare go-for-broke performances (screaming, slicing, throwing things, and at one point doing a really odd 'straight-jacket' dance on the floor of a room), but sadly her dedication is lost in a film that aims high and scores low. ***By the way, it's shot in black and white-apparently they decided to suck the blood out of the color tints.

Vampirism is used as the grand metaphor for 20th century ills. Disease, AIDS, crime, drug use. Everything. The Addiction stirs it all like a big stew.Kathy Conklin is an NYU grad student bitten by a mugger one night. She starts to think she has become a vampire and even drinks blood and avoids sunlight. The plot doesn't progress in the usual Hollywood fashion. There is no villain to be killed or hero to be saved (although there is a rousing finale).People into movies like Van Helsing will (I guarantee) dislike The Addiction. It has definite horror touches and the ending leaves you shaken but it is not strictly a horror film. It's also a mood piece (shot in lovely black in white by Ken Kelsch) and a drama. It may be too slow for the average horror audience and all the philosophy talk and discussion about war atrocities will confuse those looking for quick, cheap thrills. But for the patient viewer, I guarantee a rewarding experience. This film has MUCH to offer (much more than Van Helsing!) Also, there are so many little fantastic touches. The brilliant use of New York city street locations and the lowlifes who hang out, smoking and shooting their lives away with drugs. The great use of Cypress Hill's I Wanna Get High, which we hear several times during the film (particularly when we see Kathy or some other street lowlife taking shooting up) and is the PERFECT song for this film. The cinematography is astonishing, turning New York into a kind of American Trannsylvania. The super freaky party scene. The scene where Kathy's friend sends her flowers and Kathy dumps out the flowers and lays on the floor sifting the dirt in her hands soothingly (perfect!).The Addiction is interesting also because it presents horror from a decidedly female perspective. And not the perspective of the perky ingenue who easily foils the villain, or a kick-butt tough girl hero, who picks up a gun and blows away the bad guy. A real female. One who is absolutely horrified in the beginning when she is mugged (and then bitten!). We see her come slowly home after this happens and her shock and terror really register.

Yep, I am going to come out punching with this one, because for nearly 80-some odd minutes, I tried &#133; I tried to get into Ferrara's mind, into his details, into his rhythm, but could not find anything to attach myself too. This was one of those films college philosophy classes drool over trying to find the inside jokes, the powerful double meanings, and the hidden power of the words &#150; but for me, a simple film viewer, this one went over my head, displayed a lack of talent, yet showed me strength with failed opportunity. The Addiction remains on VHS without the transfer to DVD for a particular reason, and while I will honestly give a reason for my disgust, I don't foresee a transfer in this films future, unless the dollar bin has any space to fill.The Addiction has two prerequisites one must accomplish prior to even thinking of enjoying this feature. The first is that you must have some knowledge of philosophy to comprehend the rants that Taylor gives (both in and out of character) &#150; even if it is simply an introduction class, you will be in a better position that I was. The second is that you must have watched or have heard of the Jim Jarmusch film Dead Man. In fact, when looked closer upon, these two films could be companions to each other &#150; both giving nearly a full college credit within the parameters of the opening and closing credits. With these two prerequisites under your belt, you are ready to endure the truth &#150; no matter how painful Ferrara makes it. I tried to enjoy Bad Lieutenant as much as I could, the cult status sky-rocketing the hypothetical stock price of Harvey Keitel's portrayal of a corrupt cop, but it just wasn't the film I was hoping for. The Addiction falls within the same. I wanted a powerful moment of cinema helmed by Lily Taylor, Christopher Walken, Edie Falco, et al, but instead a was handed 80+ minutes of incoherent gibberish. Have you seen I Shot Andy Warhol? If you find yourself with the answer of yes, than you have seen an identical character delivered by Lily Taylor. Ranting, raving, and pushing the limits of independence, Taylor finds herself welcomed unrepentantly into the world of the vampire. Using reverse psychology, philosophical rants, and even the taste of drugs, Taylor becomes a creature of the night &#150; ready to suck blood and bore to sleep.The rest of the characters attempt to give something to camera, but that piece of machinery doesn't lie. Falco is as stiff as a board, Walken tries to steal his scenes, but they merely interpret into hack philosophy quotes. Then we have others (like Fredro Star) that one could mention, but it would just waste your time. The camera focus' on Taylor, and while I can get lost in her blunt mannerism, this wasn't the film for her talents. The picture didn't seem to match the artists, and vice versa. The music didn't seem to match the theme, and the emotion didn't seem to match the words. Addiction felt like a student film, pushing the limits of nothing while trying to seem more artistic than entertaining. The line was fuzzy. I needed either a deeper character study or a deeper plot, I wanted something that would make me think &#150; not bend my mind unwillingly. The language seemed forced and the plot seemed unrealistic. I realize that this is a film about vampires, but two scenes made me shudder uncontrollably (and not in a good way). The first is when Taylor drugs her professor using the infamous in and out method, and the second was when Taylor has the party and everyone goes ballistic &#150; as if nobody will notice that people are missing. I needed more development, more explanation, more voice to this philosophical film. Ferrara could have made this into a breathtaking film that explored possibilities, but instead he let the camera slide, let the music destroy the scene, and allowed our actors to go character-less throughout the entire film. In essence, the film imploded.Overall, I wish I had something positive to say about this film. I wanted to like it, because I thought the cast was incredible &#150; such big names &#150; but nobody seemed to work for the pennies they were probably making. This film is a blemish on Walken's career, proving that he cannot save everything. The hokie black and white choice for cinematography was creative, but not original. It distracted from our central focus and forced us to scurry around near the end of the film to find it. This is an independent film, but that doesn't mean that it is a good independent film. There are problems throughout this feature that destroy the characters, sound, and sights throughout. It is hard to watch, just like Dead Man, and may even put you to sleep before you know what happens. The characters were forced or non-existent, the sound was horrid (completely didn't match the film's tone), and the story was bland. This was yet another way of trying to appeal to smarter viewers without actually listening. Sure, throw in philosophical words &#150; that makes any feature better (did you hear the sarcasm?) &#150; but with Addiction nothing could save it. There is one final scene that is the epitome of how I felt about this movie, it is right before the party when Taylor is so angry she destroys a closet while trying to rip her clothes off. If one had a camera in my house, I believe you would have seen the same thing as this film came to a close. Please avoid &#150; it isn't worth the VHS it is printed on.Grade * out of ***** "},{"Title":"Ethical Relativism In A Horror Film","Date":"9 November 2003","Score":"6 out of 12 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Drama","Review":"  As I`ve said in just about every movie with the name  Abel Ferrara  in the credits he`s a director who doesn`t deserve a reputation for being a maker of video nasties simply because he`s not .

Kathleen craves blood to satisfy her addiction & there are plenty of unwilling donors walking around the streets of New York...This American Argentinian co-production was directed by Abel Ferrara & I personally hated every dull second of it. The script by Nicholas St. John is basically a metaphor for drug addiction, the way Kathleen craves blood & will do anything to get it, the way she ends up in hospital with blood pouring from her mouth which I suppose could be seen as the Vampire equivalent of vomit. To my mind I found it incredibly dull & boring, when I watch a film all I want is to be entertained & The Addiction fails in that simple task spectacularly. Sure there are plenty of great films out there with strong messages, Trainspotting (1996) for one which as it happens also deals with drugs, so why can't The Addiction be both entertaining & have a meaning? I don't know...Director Ferrara films in black and white for absolutely no reason that I can think of, seriously why was The Addiction shot like this? There's no real style or particularly strong use of light & shadow so all I can think of is that the filmmakers thought it would look more arty, or something like that. Forget about decent blood or gore, there's some fake blood splashed around but nothing graphic.Apparently shot in twenty days technically The Addiction is alright although the black and white cinematography did nothing for me. The acting was OK, Christopher Walken fans should be aware that despite his near top-billing in the credits he has nothing more than a cameo.The Addiction may appeal to some upper class film critics who think they can see lots of meaningful moral messages in it, personally I thought it was crap & nearly put me to sleep.

For Abel Ferrara, apparently, that saving grace is submission to Christianity--or at least that seems to be the meaning of the final scenes. In any case it seems clear to me that all the talk about philosophy in the film is meant to be little more than mumbo-jumbo. Philosophy alone is powerless in the face of evil.Vampirism is an ideal symbol of evil. It is portrayed as an addiction or a disease--something inescapable and inherent, like original sin. In a world of wholesale cruelty and slaughter (as in those recurrent images from the death camps), the appearance of vampires on our city streets seems like a logical next step. The startling feeding frenzy of the vampires toward the end of the movie easily represents evil that has run rampant in a spiritually barren world.Perhaps the director and screenwriter are taking on too much, but this is a compelling movie--dark, grim, and intense. As someone who generally dismisses vampire stories as silly superstition and is unable to take seriously the idea of wielding a crucifix as a weapon, I found this vampire movie downright scary. The wonderful black-and-white cinematography certainly added to the effect, as did the excellent performance by Lili Taylor.

Using haunting black and white photography and a moody, foreboding score, Ferrara paints a nihilistic picture of downtown NYC in the 1990s, juxtaposing the ethical dilemmas of its philosophy student protagonist with the urban, Darwinistic wasteland of night-time NYC. The first twenty minutes are stunningly realized, especially the first Vampire bite; thereafter, the film becomes rather too self-conscious for its own good, eschewing its eerie sense of fragmented space for oblique philosophical references. Philosophy and film do not often make good bedfellows because the former is a visual medium that denies rational assessment. Ferrara allows the actors to rise above the material by virtue of his detached yet edgy direction. All in all, A triumph of sorts.

Well - in a sense it is, but actually it has very little to do with standard vampire tales. If you like a horror movie, The Addiction will not fulfill your needs. The 'horror' there is is quite surreal and grotesque, such as the disturbing 'party-scene', and neither frightening nor humorous.So what is the movie about? A lot of things. About being addicted, obviously, but many other themes - such as guilt, redemption, free will, the problem of evil, and others - are present too. There is no closely reasoned message here - at least, I couldn't find it - but more a kaleidoscope of problems and questions. If nothing else, it makes you think.The acting is pretty good, and the black-and-white photography is superb. If the plot is somewhat vague, the atmosphere is always great.The only real weak point of the movie - in my opinion - is the rather clear Christian message at the end. I had expected something more original, after a movie littered with Nietzsche, Kierkegaard and many other philosophers - and some disturbing other comments too.We are not evil because we do evil - we do evil because we are evil.I've given this movie 8 out of 10.

Here he portrays the secret underbelly of New York's subculture of vampires. The vampirism portrayed here is like a form a drug addiction for junkies feed off of illegal drugs like heroin, amoung others, vampires have the feed for blood. The lead character is Lili Taylor who plays Kathleen, a NYU med student studying for her Ph.D and living a lonely existence in a small apartment in Greenwich Village. One evening while walking home from night classes studying about war and the devastation, a chicly dressed woman, known only as Casanova, grabs Kathleen off the street, drags her into an alley and bites her on the neck. The bite slowly transforms Kathleen into a vampire, one of the undead to walk the earth feasting on blood. Kathleen then spends the rest of the movie trying to come to terms with her new existence. Her first impressions of not being able to eat, sleep, tolarate sunlight, unable cast a reflection in a mirror, or to enter a person's residence without an invitation is a hard one for her. Kathleen's new life is shown as she is a type of junkie with the insasible appetite for human blood and is to be dependent on it.  While fighting her blood lust, Kathleen has discussions with her history professor as well as her best friend, Jean, about things like war, death, and other intelectual issues such as poety, and books like Naked Lunch, etc. But eventually Kathleen gives into her addition and her first victim is a street bum huddled in a doorway who puts up an even less struggle than she did with Casanova.  Not wanting to bite her dirty, first victim with her new stubby fangs, Kathleen takes some of his blood with a hyperdermic needle which she injects into her arm, like a heroin junkie. With that her transformation to full vampire is complete and she then goes around vitimizing fellow students, professors, strangers and friends.Shot in black and white on a very low budget, The Addiction is a must-see for all those who crave sub-culture art house films. Though the film looks very art-house as an almost student made picture. Like some of other works by Abel Ferrara, it has strong Catholic messages symbolizing that the only way for one to survive is to seek redemption before God. Lili Taylor is very good as the student turned vampire whom we share her point of view almost throughout the film. Her transformation to vampire in the early scenes is compelling for her transformation physically changes her too into a dark, pasty complextion of a young version of Patti Smith. Kathleen belives that since she is a vampire, and cannot die, she is one better than everyone around her. But midway through the movie, Kathleen's belief that she's superior over the teeming masses of New York is shatered when, during one of her nighttime prowls for victims, she has a run-in with another vampire, a gauntly handsome bloodsucker named Penia who is played by the great Christopher Walken, who's so convincing in his minor role that one really must wonder if he really is a vampire in real life. Inviting Kathleen back to his loft for some nighttime talk, Penia makes no attempt to hide his contempt for Kathleen and her parasitic existence and saying that just because that they're vampires there's no reason to repent their sins and make a life for themselves that's (almost) human as he has. Penia's talk makes Kathleen wonder if this life is really for her, which sets the stage for the climatic massacre which she masterminds with her sire Casanova. The vampire carnage at a party Kathleen throws is both horrifying and funny as a sort of Night of the Living Dead meets Kicking and Screaming.The Catholic messages that repentence is the only way to find salvation and end one's lifestyle is a little confusing as well as some of the poetic rethoric thrown by all of the characters in the film that one may find hard to follow. But the (sort of) happy ending makes little sense since a lot of things are never fully explained in detail. Gore fans by be slightly dissapointed over the lack of blood and guts over the more favored characterization and poetic dialogue. But overwall a very good, not your average vampire drama one would expect to see.

Little resemblance between the two movies beyond that.  Lili Taylor, at home in these off-center roles, heads up the most grueling story of psychological disintegration since the vaguely similar Vampire's Kiss.  Christopher Walken, straight from a turn as a renegade angel in The Prophecy, here has a role as another vampire.Vampirism as a metaphor for drug addiction meets grad-school sophistry, as an afflicted doctoral candidate (Taylor )struggles to place vampirism into a philosophical context of human suffering, evil, and nihilism.  Blood-spattered scenes of vampirism are set against a backdrop of images from the Holocaust and Vietnam.  It makes for some interestingly incomprehensible, pretentious dialogue--like thoughts that come to mind when you're running a 104-degree fever.  Spoilers follow.At least three times in the movie, a vampire attacking someone tells his/her victim  Look me in the face and tell me to go away like you mean it!  If this brings to mind the Biblical injunction, Resist the Devil and he will flee from you, it's appropriate before it's all over, the film identifies mankind's bloodthirsty addiction/illness with a once-familiar name sin.  Our heroine, laid up in the hospital, gladly takes communion following her simple request God forgive me.  Spoilers continue.The final scene, in which she lays a rose on her own grave and walks away from it, is puzzling if taken literally.  Symbolically, it appears to represent the Christian belief in the death of the old man and putting on the new man, the beginning of a new life born again. (For further Biblical parallels to aspects of this film's story, see also Isaiah 118; Acts 1721; and I Corinthians 119-20.) Significantly, if a tad heavy-handedly, her gravestone indicates she was born on October 31st, with all the sinister associations thereof, and died on November 1st... All Saints' Day.All told, a strange movie, middlebrow in its philosophical aspirations, yet capable of scenes of bloody frenzy.  Not for everybody... in fact, it's not at all clear who its intended audience was supposed to be... so if you're looking for a fun vampire flick, keep looking, since this one is pretty rough sledding at times.

It stands up reasonably well to repeat viewings, inviting further and deeper analysis. Christopher Walken is excellent as usual as an ennui-stricken bloodsucker, and Lili Taylor delivers a chillingly credible performance as the doctor of philosophy who acquires a taste for the red stuff.

Now from his two previous films that I have seen I have guessed that this man makes some quite disturbing movies that really have no point and it all happens over again with The Addiction which really is a film trying to be something else.Lilly Taylor plays Kathleen, a philosophy student who is quite an outcast to the world. She has friends and likes to mind her own business till one night she is walking home from the University and she is suddenly grabbed by an unknown woman played by Annabella Scirroa and she takes a liking to her neck and before any introducing she starts to get stuck in. Whether or not she is a vampire I can't answer as in this entire film of many neck biting moments you do not see one fang throughout so this questions the film whether the film is about Vampires with fangs or vampires without and just like to taste blood. Afterwards changes begin to occur in Kathleen's life and of course her zest for the taste of blood becomes more apart of her life. At first it just starts by her injecting other people's blood into her veins but then the she begins to invite people around to her apartment and really get stuck in. Here her life is turned around by all this and she is taken into a journey of madness. On the way she meets more victims then she finally meets Christopher Walken who is just like her but knows how to control his addiction for blood better than others. More of the so called story unfolds and it just seems this film goes nowhere whatsoever. I don't understand why studio's would give funding to a film like this. All the way through it just talks about redemption and stuff and I don't feel convinced by any of this. I've spoken to some people and they say it's probably his best work but I still think King of New York is his best work to date and if he keeps making films like The addiction it will be his best film for a long time to come. The performances from Lili Taylor was very good but I just got this feeling that she was trying to hard to be her character and just goes on in scenes and doesn't make any sense of it. I suppose if I had been bitten by somebody on the neck then I wouldn't be in the right frame of mind but that's not the point, the point is that Abel Ferrara has thrown out a film that is to short and at 79 minutes running time, you can't be expected to throw out a good enough film with this long a film. Christopher Walken was the best thing about it as his character isn't to much to take in and he actually sounds interesting without be annoying unlike Lili Taylor who just drove me mad throughout cause I don't like her acting at all. The Addiction is the reason why Abel Ferrara won't be remembered in 50 years and if he is then it will be to just remember that he made that crap film The Addiction and was trying to hard. Hopefully King of New York will stand its time, but if you watch Driller Killer which is beyond awful, Bad Lieutenant which is just a shock film without the shocks , King of New York will restore your faith in Ferrara and The Funeral which isn't half bad, but the Addiction is just not what I wanted and neither will you. The question is, is this a vampire film cause I think it wasn't.

Horror is not a theme which Ferrara is highly regarded for, however 'The addiction' rather tends to pursue giving a dictation on philosophical theories than intending to frighten the viewer. I first watched this when I was a student myself. This is one movie that can be appreciated for what exists underneath than watching people being bitten. Initially many will perceive this to be a vampire movie. But ones perception will be dependant on how he/she understands the concept. Shot in black and white, this has intended to give the movie a Gothic atmosphere. I personally felt that the black and white presentation eradicates a small proportion of the level of enjoyment that could have been experienced.SPOILERS The basic plot revolves around Lily Taylor who plays a philosophy student. On one night she is bitten by Annabelle Sciorra. From that night on the course of her life changes forever as she slowly begins to live life differently and acts in inhuman manners. She sucks blood from a few individuals and in between we hear quotes of philosophy that she narrates. In the end she attains her degree and indulges in a blood orgy at a get together party with a few of a revamped friends. I found it difficult to understand the final scene. My interpretation was quite confusing. I could not understand if Taylor was alive or dead. The movie ends on a strange piece of thought. But plot wise one should not expect much on it. END OF SpoilerThis is one of Abel Ferrara's more intelligent and less appreciated movies. He had moved far away from the tacky material that he used to make in the 70s and 80s. Many may experience a unsettling feeling with the images of a graphic nature but this is part of what Taylor is studying. Lily Taylor gives a fine performance and her constant body movements expressing the pain she feels is very realistic. She does more than act. The movie has a fast pace and with a short running time of 82 minutes there is never a dull moment. This will not be suited to the taste of many but if one has a interest in philosophy, one can't go wrong.

The characters in The Addiction do nothing but name drop philosophers.  It's like Kierkagard said  It's like Nietzche said.  It's like Sartre said.  I am familiar with the works of Friedrich Nietzche, and I am in no way impressed with people who constantly refer to his work.Christopher Walken, usually so cool, shows up for less than 2 minutes, and he has absolutely no impact on events, making me wonder why he gets such high billing for something so forgettable.I suppose philosophy majors enjoy this, in between working where ever it is that philosophy majors get jobs.  The Addiction is nothing but a self-righteous bore, and that's putting it mildly.  I even liked Interview with the Vampire, and I still can't take how absolutely heavy-handed this waste of film is.

It came off as close to what being a vampire really would be as could be done. At least to my way of thinking. Lili Taylor was perfect as the philosophy spouting, newly made vampiress, Kathleen. Her victims were plentiful, and their feeding time near the show's end was a neck biting good time. I put this one up there with Count Yorga, Vampire and House of Dark Shadows for a chilling look at the undead.

This was Ferrara's third horror film after THE DRILLER KILLER (1979), which I haven't watched, and the more straightforward and much more enjoyable BODY SNATCHERS (1993) ugly-looking with an annoying hip-hop soundtrack to match, the film is generally muddled and - pardon the pun - lifeless. Still, the bloody vampire attacks are quite effective (especially when the undead are brought together and let loose at a party - a similar idea was adopted for the disco scenes in AN American WEREWOLF IN Paris 1997) and the main actors give undeniably committed performances Lili Taylor (striking a good balance between vulnerability and the inevitable ferocity when aroused), Christopher Walken (mesmerizing in his one scene) and Annabella Sciorra (who makes for a fetching vampire lady).

The Addiction is Ferrara's most stylish achievement to date and he also came a long way - when it comes to subtleness - since &#145;The Driller Killer'. The Addiction is a brilliant piece of philosophical horror&#133;one of the most intelligent screenplays I ever beheld, and it easily mixes both historical topics (the Holocaust) and modern concerns (AIDS, drugs&#133;). Ferrara's direct and raw approach raises the feeling you're watching a traditional B-movie. The stunning black and white cinematography even increases this feeling as you're being catapulted straight into an unknown setting where different cultures and social classes get involved with each other. Key figure in all this is Kathleen Conklin (magnificently portrayed by Lili Taylor) &#133;Once a devoted college student, now a confused `undead' with an uncontrollable need for blood. She was bitten down a dark alley and quickly turned into a vampire herself. Note that the word `vampire' isn't used in this film once, by the way. After recovering from the trauma a bit, Kathleen goes through a complete metamorphosis and &#145;contaminates' quite a lot persons herself and she even bumps into some sort of mentor who clarifies her she's facing eternity. This character is given image by the almighty Christopher Walken, who's ruling the screen with his powerful charisma. Everything in The Addiction is pretty much perfect according to me! The majority of Abel Ferrara's films are pretty personal, and even then, this very well might be his least accessible film&#133; Atmosphere, tension, satire, acting, directing&#133;all perfect! Under normal circumstances, I totally loathe rap-soundtracks but it didn't bother me here and I even thought it was appropriate and essential in order to create the right image. This whole production is intriguingly weird and uniquely eccentric, a must for fans of non-mainstream cinema. I'll do my best and recommend this to as many people as possible since it's one of the greatest B-movies I ever saw and easily one of the few cult treasures of the nineties!

You might as well spank this film's ass and call it Charlie, because it was nothing special at all.
