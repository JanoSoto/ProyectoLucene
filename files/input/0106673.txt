No sex (well none worth worrying about), no violence, and not too taxing on the brain, a wonderful tonic.Pre 9/11 it's true, and all to be taken with a pinch of salt, but after all that's gone on in the White House over the years, I found it not totally implausible.

The multi-talented Kevin Kline was excellent in the double role, Sigourney Weaver enchanting as the First Lady, Ben Kingsley reliable as ever as the Vice-President, but it was Frank Langella as the WH Chief of Staff who stole the show. He was superb.To those who may say that Dave doesn't give a true reflection on American politics or make a political statement, I would agree with them, but then it surely didn't mean to.

Kevin Kline plays a dual role. He plays President Bill Mitchell, and Dave Kovic, a look-alike for the chief executive. When he is asked to fill in for him as a decoy, he jumps to serve his nation. However, the real Bill Mitchell suffers a stroke and lays comatose. That's when the White House Chief of Staff, Bob (Frank Langella) and the Press Secretary, Alan (Kevin Dunn) convince Dave to stay on. According to them, the Vice President (Ben Kingsley) is mentally unbalanced. Dave, being naive, falls for it. However, they do not count on a generally nice guy wanting to really play the part of chief executive. He figures out their plan and turns the table, wanting to do real public policy that will make a true difference. Sigourney Weaver plays the estranged First Lady who must be kept in the dark, which is half the battle during this wonderful comedy. I liked this movie on so many levels. The first was that this movie was not silly slapstick humor like First Kid, nor did it resort to preachiness and making a political point in The American President. Dave also did not rely on excessive action in Air Force One. Instead, we have the basic idea that if we get good, honest people elected to office, good things will happen. Almost Capra-esquire, the film is earnest, not wanting to push one political agenda over another. What makes this message work is the restrained direction of Ivan Reitman, and the subtle, yet honest performance of Kevin Kline (one of the best actors ever). One of the most entertaining aspect of this movie is watching actual members of Congress, the Washtingon Press Corps, and popular entertainment making cameos. This is what gave the movie a sense of realism. Finally, Reitman helps the audience fall for the plot. He makes it so believable, honest and true. In the end, the audience will realize that politics will not mend our nation, but rather honest people will. In any case of all the movies about the President, this is the best one. "},{"Title":"Dave  A Vote For Innocence","Date":"4 February 2006","Score":"22 out of 23 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" Another feel good movie from Ivan Reitman? Who'da thunk it? Seriously, folks, that's not at all a bad thing. Firstly, I must say that I am a died in the wool Reitman fan, and from that perspective, this review may be considered biased. Reitman's nearly incomparable ability to craft sweetly funny, heart touching, tongue in cheek films is at the core of this movie, as well.The premise Dave Kovic (Kevin Kline), proprietor of an temporary employment agency and part time Presidential impersonator, is spotted and recruited by the Secret Service to do a brief body double appearance for current President William Harrison Mitchell at a Washington networking dinner. Although explained to Dave as doubling for the President in exposed situations, in reality he is the scandal stopping alibi for Mitchell, currently Lewinski-ing his secretary Randi (a very small part for the tremendously talented Laura Linney). Simple enough, until the unthinkable happens Mitchell, while in flagrante delicto, suffers a massive stroke and becomes completely incapacitated.With a little ingenuity, this may have been covered up and smoothed over simply by transferring leadership to the Vice President, as specified by law. However, White House Chief of Staff Bob Alexander (Frank Langella) has other ideas entirely. Seizing on the opportunity to obtain his greatest ambition, the Presidential office for himself, Alexander decides to take matters into his own hands. Enlisting the reluctant aid of Press Secretary Alan Reed (Kevin Dunn), together they convince Dave that, for the good of the country and the world at large, he must continue to double for the President until Mitchell recovers from his slight circulatory problem of the head. Suddenly, this very down to earth guy finds himself in the most unreal of circumstances, thought of by all but a handful of insiders to BE the actual President of the United States.Although smoothly sailing at the start, as time passes, things begin to become complicated. Dave's naturally sweet personality, gentle sense of fun and moral character are by no means similar to Mitchell's, and cannot help but surface. Soon, the watchdogs of Washington, and the American public, begin to notice the difference. So does the First Lady. Estranged from her husband although living under the same roof, the more time she spends with Dave, the more keenly aware she is of the change in her husband. She begins to have her suspicions that all is not as it seems. And Dave, becoming more immersed and comfortable in his new role, decides to stretch his wings and take a shot at actually DOING the President's job for real, much to the growing consternation of Bob Alexander.Now Could this happen in real life? Probably not. With all of the security, surveillance and snooping that certainly goes on every day in Washington, could the two Pit vipers, Alexander and Reed, really pull this off? Oh, hell, no. Would a woman not know her husband even if she confronted him naked in the shower? As as woman, I doubt it. We ALWAYS know. But, to paraphrase the moderator of The Mclaughlin Report, the correct answer is Who cares? This film was never meant to be Murder at 1600 or The Shadow Conspiracy. No, think of it more as Air Bud Goes to Washington. A delightful departure from reality. A delicious What if...? story. Reitman films are NEVER believable. That is precisely what makes them so wonderful. Yes, this movie asks you to suspend belief for about two hours. Yes, it asks you to swallow the idea that Dave could fool not only the First Lady, but his cabinet, Congress, and the country at large. In fact, it seems he has convinced everyone except Oliver, a delicious cameo appearance by Oliver Stone on Larry King's show.My best advice on Dave Just watch it and love it for what it is. Forget the plot accuracies and the believability factor. Watch the actors, who are superb. Part of what makes Reitman films so watchable is the interaction between the players, the subtle sub plots and undercurrents to the story. Sigorney Weaver is excellent as First Lady Ellen Mitchell. Kevin Dunn does a marvelous job with the conflicted Alan Reed, bound by past misdeeds and present schemes to Bob Alexander yet finding a growing respect and affection for Dave. Ving Rhames is perfectly cast as Duane Stevenson, the President's personal Secret Service man. Stoic and unyieldingly correct, he also finds himself becoming attached to Kline's easily lovable Dave, as does legendary actor Ben Kingsley in his role as Vice President Nance.Kevin Kline, as usual, turns in a workmanlike performance, making Everyman Dave Kovic someone you'd love to have for your own friend. More, he makes you wish a guy like him would actually BE elected President. And what do you say about Frank Langella? He's always magnetic. Those deeply penetrating eyes with their deadly glare, that softly evil voice. Listen carefully to his dialog. Spoken softly, it doesn't do for you to miss his delivery of some of the best lines in the film. His facial expressions say more than ten pages of script could ever. Speaking of facial expressions, watch Charles Grodin as Murray Blum, Dave's accountant friend, especially in the closing scenes of the movie. Hilarious without saying a word.In case you haven't gathered, I loved this movie. I've watched it countless times, and highly recommend it as a charming, witty and touching break from the reality of politics and life in general. Buy this film. You'll be glad you did.

However, after he suffers a massive stroke, he lapses into a coma, his chief of staff and chief scriptwriter however are intertwined in a corruption scandal and if the vice president takes over they will be scuppered. So rather than do that they decide to keep using the stand-in to maintain the illusion that the president is just fine.Not having suffered the rise to power that many politicians go through Dave isn't blinded by just running things the way they always have been and can see the many wrong decisions that politicians make simply to keep the status quo and, after tiring of simply following the orders of the chief of staff, decides to do what so few US presidents do, and make things better for the working man.To this and the last decade Gary Ross is what Frank Capra was to the thirties and forties, with a variety of feel good films that challenge are ideas about what the world is and what it should be. The script for this film is dynamite with a ton of great touches, including Dave's changing from Presidential script reader to tourist as he spots a souvenir. The film manages to stride in between the dangerous path of a hard right Eastwood-Esque take on things and the ultra-liberal path that someone like Redford would focus on. Instead the film manages to put itself in the minds of the ordinary Joe, who watches in disbelief at the stupid things that the powers that be spend money on, when so many problems still go on without being addressed at all, with sound bites like You can't solve problems by throwing money at them (How come it's only the wealthy that say that?)The performances are all first rate with Kevin Kline magnificent as the idealistic Dave Kovic thrown into the deep end after becoming the leader of the free world, Frank Langella and Alan Reed also excel as the Chief of staff and Chief scriptwriter, with Charles Grodin stealing the scene as the put upon Murray who takes on various people from Dave's temp agency when he is stuck finding work for people elsewhere. The direction is nothing special but succeeds in telling the story with humour and sadness that very often the people who get the top job have so little knowledge of the people at the bottom to make any significant change in society.First rate, and far better than the IMDb rating suggests. Also watch out for a great end gag. Top drawer.

Things get complicated because the real president suffers a debilitating stroke, and the poser is asked to maintain the deception for national security reasons by a corrupt power mongering chief-of-staff.Kevin Kline does an excellent job as the innocent who finds he is a modern day Mr. Smith going to Washington, encountering scandals and corruption going on at these levels. The shadow-government conspiracy theory is nothing new, but this film utilizes the idea with an optimistic viewpoint, since the lead character chooses to effect positive changes, rather than exploit the situation. Corruption is seen as the exception rather than the rule, and that honest people can remove this blight from the landscape, if only they had the bravery to do so. Certainly this is a wildly idealistic premise, but it works.Political insiders are the baddies, the rest of us are the good guys, represented by Dave (a great acting performance by Kevin Kline). Ben Kingsley is great as the sincere and benevolent vice president. Sigourney Weaver is wonderful as the ignored first lady who keys into the deception, and Frank Langella is well cast as the plotting diabolical foe of democracy, Bob Alexander.

Kevin Kline is perfect in the role--both roles--a little goofy but totally believable. The rest of the cast doesn't much matter. They are decent if never amazing. It's a lightweight movie and to demand much beyond the gags and feel good qualities isn't fair to it.Does it hold up twenty years after it was made? Oddly, yes. You might not even notice it's a bit outdated on the fringes. Politics in some ways has not changed a bit. And the idea of body doubles for the U.S. President is still in currency (see Vantage Point for starters). Of course the notion of a secretive government that might pull of a huge scam isn't far-fetched at all (except of course that you hope it actually is far-fetched outside of Hollywood--see Wag the Dog for starters).There is also the use of lots of real people to bolster the idea that it's real, or could be real. Some are identified (senators and other celebrities from the era) so if you don't recognize them you should at least trust that these people are not actors. But there are a number (like 20 or 30) of other real people playing themselves, including Oliver Stone. In case you don't know him, Stone is being interviewed on Larry King Live (with the real Larry King) and he says that they've studied photos of the new president and that it's a conspiracy. This is really one of the many little hilarious lines because Stone, of course, is famous for hatching or nurturing conspiracy theories for his movies. His JFK came out just two years earlier.The other fun one most people will miss (and this dates me) is running into an unidentified Tip O'Neill on the streets. He was the real speaker of the house, and it's a great little three seconds. He dies the following year.Okay, the movie isn't brilliant. But it never gets stale, and it's well made enough to survive even a curmudgeon without popcorn. It'll make you laugh.

Everyone associated with this movie should be very proud of what they created, a truly great movie.I was thinking just the other night about a top 10 list of movies that I can watch over and over, and that still work every time. Dave would be on it, along with North by Northwest and The Producers. But Dave produces a different emotional response than these two; it is closer to The Princess Bride, in that it is a very pleasant movie that makes you feel good, even when you feel bad. The script of Dave is fantastic, with lots of memorable lines, and the plot has more hairpin turns than the Alaska Highway. But it is the movie's effectiveness in producing emotional responses to various scenes that sets it apart. The ending is especially powerful. Great directing, writing and acting!Dave has elements of The Prince and the Pauper, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, and Superman, the latter because you have to suspend your disbelief that the public won't recognize Dave. Also, for those too young to remember, former vice president Nelson Rockefeller died while having sex with a young mistress, an obvious inspiration for the story. The story also bears some resemblance to President Bill Clinton's escapades, but those came later. During the premiere of Frank Capra's Mr. Smith, half of Washington walked out of the theater in outrage over the portrayal of corruption, which probably cut a bit too close to the truth for some of them. This time, half of Washington appeared in the film! Capra died two years before Dave was released, but I am sure he would have enjoyed it, and been delighted to see the Capra style continued so beautifully by Ivan Reitman and Gary Ross. If you haven't seen Dave, you must watch it. And if you have, watch it again. And again. And again. You will enjoy it every time. Unless, perhaps, you are a crooked politician.

The segment toward the end of the film, when he and Sigourney Weaver are pulled over for the turn violation, and they do their version of Tomorrow from Annie is absolutely hilarious. This is one of those films that, for some reason or another, I keep going back to watch every so often, mainly because of its entertainment and values orientation. Our President and Congressional Delegations should care more about us than themselves. I'm still waiting, but I haven't seen that happen yet, nor have I seen a movie about the President of Slovenia. When I do I'll be sure to comment on it.

Because of the charm, wit and kind heart of this picture, I am willing to dismiss any and all elements that may seem more-than-unlikely in Dave. This is how much I think of this film.I was introduced to Kevin Kline two years prior, in the excellent romp Soapdish, and to Sigourney Weaver five years prior, in Gorillas In The Mist. Both thespians became favorites because of these movies.Charles Grodin is my favorite straight man, and I laughed out loud at his scenes. I have been a fan of his since 1987's Ishtar. Kingsley is an actor capable of great depth, and I admired the restraint of great emotion he displayed as V.P.It was great to see Helen Thomas. We all miss her.Although Dave is mostly light-hearted and enjoyable, there is a serious aspect to it It portrays the seedy underside of D.C. politics, in particular, those of the executive branch Can chiefs-of-staff, prominent aides-de-camp or lobbyists for foreign governments really run the show, with the president being just a figure-head? Could a coup take place by events similar to those in Dave?Not exactly, but it is worth thinking about.The scene where Klein (as the president) sits and talks with a boy in a homeless shelter was excellent, as was Weaver's well-reserved show of support for it.The ending is ingenious and unexpected. Brilliant.Dave is entertaining-yet-inspiring. It is both frightening in its implications and emboldening in the moral capacity and expression shown not only by the pseudo-president, but by most of those in his closest circle.I think we need something like the events depicted in Dave to happen in real-life. Then again, if we somehow found ourselves in the graces of a moral president, he or she would probably find themself immobilized or worse by pervasive greed, corruption and decay. The movie Dave shows us that there is always hope. Just don't let the light go out.

Recruited to attend an event as the President while Mitchell has a roll in the hay with his secretary, Dave is suddenly put into political office after Mitchell falls under a coma. Though he first tries to fill the President's shoes, Dave soon shuffles off his puppeteers and attempts to make a few changes to the bewilderment of lecherous Chief of Staff Bob Alexander (Frank Langella).Despite its hokey high concept, Dave has a beautifully written screenplay that hones in on the populist fervor of some of Frank Capra's best. Surprisingly unlike Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Dave was actually praised by many in the political establishment and featured cameos ranging from Democratic Senators Christopher Dodd and Paul Simon to conservative pundit Robert Novak and future Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. The underlying themes in Dave however are not entirely serviced with the films aw-shucks approach. Dave as President Mitchell at one point introduces a comprehensive jobs bill that while warms the cockles is light on details. Still no one can expect a film about responsible politics to actually give answers to complex problems. If it did, who'd want to watch? The real challenge of the film was holding back the silliness so as not to belay the films more serious moments. Director Reitman wisely manages to tread that minefield with the help of great acting veterans Kevin Kline and Sigourney Weaver. One of Kline greatest strengths is playing the well meaning fool and while he may not bring anything new to the trope, Kline still manages to be massively entertaining. Sigourney Weaver has a tough job playing the emotionally distant first lady Ellen and her ignorance of the switch isn't entirely believable. Still the chemistry between Kline and Weaver is electric and gently drifts from hatred to love without getting overtly schmaltzy. All due credit must also be given to Frank Langella who is simply irreproachable as the opportunistic Chief of Staff. Additionally Ben Kingsley, as always gives the movie much needed heft as Vice President making his one precious scene the nutritious part of Dave's candy coated political message.I once read an article that bemoaned the political satires of the Bush administration nostalgic for those of the Clinton years. While films like Primary Colors and Wag the Dog concentrated on themes like corruption of power while only eluding to the man in the round room, films like American Dreamz and W. settled on making personal bellow-the-belt pot-shots at the sitting President. Dave falls comfortably in the former category.

It's intended to be heartwarming, hilarious, and romantic, and in all this it succeeds.

This stand in, who bears a striking resemblance to him, is a temporary office replacement worker named Dave Kovic, a kind, likable, and good natured guy. However, the President suffers a massive stroke during this sexual escapade, producing a coma. His corrupt Chief of Staff, Bob Alexander, fears the Vice President would fire him if he assumed office. He thus persuades Dave that it is not in the country's best interests for this VP to take over and that he, Dave, should continue his newfound Presidential responsibilities indefinitely. Alexander intends to use Dave as a puppet until he himself can assume power. Despite the Chief of Staff's manipulative efforts, Dave eventually finds he has his own ideas as to presidential policy, not to mention the fact that he also finds himself attracted to the neglected First Lady.Kevin Kline is convincing as both the uninspiring President Mitchell and the endearing, friendly, hard working, and well intended Dave, who finds himself in quite an unsettling position, until he comes to grips with power struggles within the White House. Signourey Weaver is equally competent as the sophisticated but ill treated First Lady (Ellen Mitchell), Frank Langella as the conniving Chief of Staff, and Ben Kingsley as the honest and decent Vice President, Murray Blum.This movie isn't attempting to make much of a serious statement, other than looking into something many people might wonder...what policies they themselves, ordinary citizens, would bring about if only they had the opportunity to sit in the Oval Office. True, the plot and its ending both have quite a few loopholes, so the tale may be much less believable than The American President. Still, it's a light hearted, amusing, touching comedy romance...and quite an effective one at that.

It was about a political murder in a Latin American country, and how an actor is forced to replace the murdered President to save the country in the middle of crucial negotiations. Tamiroff carried off the improbable plot very well, bringing a growing courage and determination to his actor who finds that he has a political conscience after all.Although the movie MOON OVER PARADOR had a similar plot to THE MAGNIFICENT FRAUD, it is DAVE that actually shows a greater link. This 1993 film deals with Dave Kovak (Kevin Kline), a part-time actor and full time head of an employment agency (where he is assisted by his friend and landlord Murray Blum (Charles Grodin). Kline also plays President William Harrison Mitchell, and it is his resemblance that brings him to the attention of the head of the White House staff Bob Alexander (Frank Langella - a very good performance) and the Communication Director Alan Reed (Kevin Dunn). They need Dave to replace the President for a few minutes after a speech. He just has to leave a hotel in place of Mitchell, and go to a limousine, and he'll be deposited back at his own address. The President can then go to another secret appointment (for a tryst).Dave does what he is supposed to, but the President does not. Mitchell has a stroke. So Langella and Reed face contacting Vice President Nance (Ben Kingsley) to take over the administration. But Langella hates Nance (he and Reed refer to the honest official as a boy scout). Langella realizes that as long as Dave continues playing the President the administration can continue until health issues allow him to quit. The real administration's brains will be Langella (and Reed's to a smaller extent). Nance, in the meantime, can be framed in the failure of a Savings and Loan Company - one actually looted by Langella and the now incapacitated President.There are two flies in the ointment. One is Nance, who is sent on a long good-will trip to Africa (while the framing takes place). The other is First Lady Ellen Mitchell (Sigourney Weaver), who has been estranged by her husband for years. She might notice the difference.Actually there is a third. While the real President Mitchell was not overly concerned about the problems of his poorer countrymen, Dave is interested in this. He actually tries to make a difference, only to be quickly put into his place as a useful fraud by the arrogant Langella. Or has he been? Soon Langella finds that his useful fraud puppet has a mind of his own, and a way to circumvent and humiliate Langella.Like all perfect double substitution movies this depends heavily on suspension of disbelief, but the cast plays very well. Witness the scenes between the stolid Secret Service man Duane Stevenson (Vhing Rhames) and Kline as Dave, who is trying to open up this guard by being friendly, only to find himself facing an official coldness on the issue of whether or not Rhames would take a bullet for him. Or the scene where Grodin comes to visit Dave at the White House, and helps him with a problem regarding balancing the national budget. Weaver, first hostile, than suspicious, and finally supportive, gives one of her two best comic performances (witness her singing Tomorrow). The film is quite a nice comedy, and the appearance of a future Californian governor in one sequence adds a strange feeling to the film.

The dialog is well-written and there are several quotable lines. There are plenty of memorable scenes in there as well. I'm impressed that the filmmakers actually managed to talk so many real senators and important people into appearing briefly in the film, especially since so many of them talk about the quality of this fictional president.

It is not possible to catch any part of this film and not to continue watching some more or until the end. This is a storytelling of great entertaining value. More importantly, it does not play one wrong note as a political plotting, which is rare, considering how diluted it is as a hardcore political story. I believe Ivan Reitman's touch is essentially behind the successful combination. He casts, interprets the story and script, and directs quite appropriately. Kevin Kline's little reactions mean a lot to the plausibility of the story. His character is playful, delightful, and yet respectful to the presidency. A scene when he must be convinced to continue with the act, which takes place in the Oval Office, is subtle and telling. It reveals in depth the characters of Kline's, of Frank Langella's, and of Kevin Dunn's with minimal dialogue. Sigourney Weaver's role as the First Lady is another great contribution to the story's dramatic effect. Both Kline and Weaver portray the real people behind the caricature and totally sell us as a convincing first couple and a political marriage. Even the actors of minor role are wonderfully complimentary. Charles Grodin, Ben Kingsley, Ving Rhames, Laura Linney, and Faith Prince show us that smaller roles can't limit any good actors. But the scriptwriter Gary Ross should be praised the highest. He exhibits the dramatic restraint throughout. Such restraint truly contributes to the believability of the entire story. Not too much, and quite enough. Dave's script is one good piece of writing. Film students can learn a lot studying it.

Ving Rhames plays the head of the security, who must keep an eye on the president at all times, and sometimes shows insecurity about trying to protect a clown, as he perceives Dave at first. Ben Kingsley also has a short role as vice-president Nance and he steals every scene.Of course some of the plot elements in the movie are a tad ridiculous and this could never work, but frankly, it doesn't need to.

When a massive stroke befalls the President of the United States,the Chief of Staff and top adviser(Kevin Dunn and Frank Langella)devise a means to cover the situation up so as to put on the pretense that the President is fine and thus averting a panic. All they need is a look-alike.This is where jovial,fair-minded employment agency head Dave Kovic(Kevin Kline,also playing the President)enters. He semi-willfully goes into this ruse,and is able to pull off the gig reasonably well,save the fact that he is more animated and pleasant than the real Commander in Chief and that the First Lady(Sigourney Weaver)seems skeptical and aloof,at least at first.Gradually,as Dave realizes that while he may command the attention and respect of the nation,he has little say or real power over the affairs of the office,and thus he is moved to make a decision that very well may blow the lid off the ruse and damage his own image and persona in the process.Wonderful performances by Kline,Weaver,Langella,Dunn,Charles Grodin(in a cameo,as a disheveled,grump--what else!--accountant friend of Dave's)and Ving Rhames(as a stone-faced and dedicated Secret Service agent)keep this buoyant throughout,giving director Ivan Reitman one of the more plum movies to run.

Now, why the meanie prez picked the goody VP is never explained -- but it doesn't matter, as long as things can fall into place for that tacked-on, absurd happy ending that is so dear to commercial filmmakers.Yet, despite its many flaws (including some awful, overbearing music), Dave is a movie worth watching because it offers Kevin Kline in top form. This brilliant actor has a tough time playing the cold and heartless president (Kline is too warm a performer to be 100% convincing as The Zombie Leader of the Free World -- wherever that world may be). But as the title character, Kline is superb handsome and goofy, alternately amused and bemused, sometimes both amused AND bemused. The supporting cast is generally capable, especially Frank Langella as the scheming Chief-of-Staff.In all honesty, this viewer was hoping against hope that Langella would get his way at the end. That would have been a more honest assessment of the political world and a more honest ending for this picture. Even so, considering today's ugly headlines, one laments that life doesn't imitate the movies -- at least as far as the political power game is concerned.

All the pomp, all the prestige, all the power... what would you do with it? Kevin Klein is great in a double role as Dave Kovic, an honest guy who genuinely enjoys finding people badly-needed work through his temp agency, and as Bill Mitchell, the stereotypical heartless political animal who serves as president despite not seeming to care about anything but his own career. When Mitchell goes into a coma, Dave - who bears an uncanny resemblance to the president - is recruited to deceive the country into believing the president is fine, until the mastermind of the operation, Bob Alexander (chief of staff), can engineer the ousting of the vice president and his own ascendant to the oval office.However, Dave just can't let things go according to plan as his own big heart forces him to risk everything to try and save his country.As a political commentary, the movie is grossly oversimplified and can't really say much beyond its warm and fuzzy message. As a comedy and light drama it works perfectly fine, with likable supporting characters (aside from Bob Alexander) and the fun fantasy of a plot works perfectly well to keep the audience interested as we are bombarded with all of the amazing aspects of life as (impostor) president.Don't expect a brilliant indictment of Washington politics, just expect a fun movie with some good chuckles, and Dave is definitely worth your time.

It looks like we have what is called a dramedy (comedy + drama = dramedy) that flips both sides of the coin. DAVE is a rewarding change of pace for Reitman, with the right actors and government officials to perform in cameos, and a convenient sense of humor in and out of the White House. Through running a real-life scenario, this accurately tells about the presidency run by a mild-mannered Kevin Kline, who is the amusing piece of DAVE. He builds on the satire level by poking fun of the politically correct system, and illustrates examples of these such films including PRIMARY COLORS (a less serious comedy). The serious side of the picture includes a sombering moment, and Frank Langella who really knows how to be strict for the entire length of the movie! Reitman must have pulled off an ambitious undertaking that doesn't evenly compare to GHOSTBUSTERS or TWINS, but it appears that any genre of film can use a touch of laughter. He did this with CANNIBAL GIRLS (1973), his first film which was strictly horror.

The only change in story is that while Zenda's hero lives happily ever after, alas, it's not with his princess. Under Ivan Reitman's sure-handed blend of subtle comedy & drama, and backed by James Newton Howard's melodic score, Kevin Kline is aces as average guy/everyman Dave, who is plucked from Small Town, USA, to assume the position of the most powerful man on earth. Equally up to the task is Frank Langella as his evil, rotten, power- hungry Chief of Staff. The co-stars, including Sigourney Weaver, Kevin Dunn, Ving Rhames, Charles Grodin & Ben Kingsley,are each finely cast. Three sound versions of Zenda were filmed in 1937 with Ronald Coleman in the dual role & Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as his adversary; in 1952 with good guy Stewart Granger vs. baddie James Mason; and finally in 1979 - the least impressive version - with Peter Sellers, in his third to last role, fighting evil Stuart Wilson. Dave matches up a lot closer with those earlier two versions than with the Seller's take. The shot of Dave heading back home over the hill, his job done, is a marvelous re-do of the Coleman version. BTW, In 1968, Don Adams wrote a take-off on Zenda as well as its 2- part sequel in '69, but that's another story, so to speak.

I never really saw Ivan Reitman as being a satirical director - the films he usually does are simply happy ending films with a few laughs in them movies like Twins and Kindergarten Cop. He is also known for doing kids movies such as Beethoven. I was wrong. Dave is satirical, though not a deep and as complex as some movies can be.Anyway, Dave finds people jobs, but in his spare time his mimics the President of the United States because he has an uncanny resemblance to him (probably because Dave and the president are played by the same actor - Kevin Kline). The secret service find Dave when they are looking for a look alike to walk out of a hotel and into a limousine, simply to protect the president. Dave agrees, but unfortunately the president suffers from a stroke while sleeping with his secretary. Suddenly Dave finds himself ruling the United States from the oval office. He is doing this because the Chief of Staff wants to become president himself, and is attempting to remove the vice-president from office and move himself in under Dave. Unfortunately Dave proves to be too much to handle, and quickly turns the tables on the Chief of Staff and a battle of wits ensures.The main theme is appearance and reality. What we have is the president - a conservative law student who is adulterous, hates his wife, and simply cares only for himself. Then we have Dave - an out going man who comes to see the power of the office as being a responsibility to the people. The chief of staff is manipulating him, but when Dave learns of what this guy is doing, he begins to take the power that is supposed to be is - all the time being reminded that he is a simply clutz from the street who happens to look like the president. He has one thing that he holds the chief of staff to though - he is pretending to be the president under the directions of the chief of staff - if he goes down then so does the chief of staff.I guess what this movie is saying is that politicians are generally people who are caught up in a world revolving around the powerhouses in Washington and only go out to the people during elections to gain votes. At other times they simply don't care. It is an interesting criticism on the budget when Dave brings in his accountant friend to go over the US budget and easily slashes 650 billion dollars from places where money is being wasted. It would be interesting to get a proper accountant to look at the figures of the budget and see if this is the case, though we only know what the government is telling us.Dave was good, and it involved the clever battle of wits that I enjoy in some movies. There was little to really complain about and I did think that Dave was quite a noble gentleman.

True, clichés are rife, but it isn't fishing in the toilet bowl for its laughs, or beating you over the head with raucous shouty antics so beloved by the MTV generation.A great cast is assembled for the fun, led superbly by the talented Kline in a role that so easily could have been over done in a lesser comic actor's hands.

He is also a dead ringer for President Bill Mitchell. So when the President is keen to get away for a night of passion with his secretary, Dave is paid to be a silent stand in at a minor walk & shake event. However, when Mitchell suffers a stroke and is incapacitated, his advisors refuse to relinquish control to the Vice President and instead install Dave as the full time temporary replacement. Despite initial nerves, Dave takes to the public side of the job &#150; his easy natural winning over the public and his change from a dour president to a man of the people is put down to the stroke. But with time in the job, Dave realises the problems in the government and Bill's marriage &#150; and resolves to change it, despite the internal resistance he is met with.With the recent cinematic attacks on Bush's Government over Iraq (Control Room, F9/11 and others), Bush must be wishing that he was being given the light touch that Hollywood gave to Bill Clinton at the time. The American President and Dave were bought light comedies with only very mild comment on the nature of government &#150; so mild that they would barely even count as a cross word in comparison to the full on attacks on Bush! Regardless of the politics of Hollywood, few people would have come to this film looking for anything in the way of social or political comment but rather a rather cosy comedy with the usual liberal idealism (we would all like to think we would change things for the better if we got in power &#150; but the realities of the world mean few can in any significant way). In this regard the film is relatively smug and cosy affair that is fun to watch but utterly naïve at the same time!The plot never gets close to the mix of comedy and comment that West Wing (in its day) had but it never really tries to. If anything the film is like very light wish fulfilment. We wish we had politicians like Dave &#150; even those with opposing beliefs would admire a man who was upright, honest, open and responsible but, regardless of who is in charge when you watch this movie, it will only ever be wish fulfilment and the warm feeling you might have when you finish the movie will last only as long as it takes for the news to come on afterwards. Despite this it does work as a comedy with a (and I shudder to use this overused phrase) Capraesque sense of America to it; many will hate it for this very reason but I found it to be a pleasantly distracting affair even if I never really bought it as a serious piece and fully acknowledge that it was a rather naïve piece of fluff!The cast is very good and contains good names in relaxed mode but still turning out suitable performances for the material. Kline is pretty good and makes for an enjoyable character as Dave &#150; he puts on his best Jimmy Stewart personae and matches the material for every idealistic point. This is not a criticism of Kline but a compliment, he did what the material required and he made it better and easier to watch by his performance. Weaver has less to do and less fun is had; she is an important part of the story and she does 'melt' well as the film progresses but she is an aside, only necessary to provide romance and some drive at key moments. Langella is good value in a role that represent modern politics well and Dunn floats around well enough. Rhames' subsequent fame makes his small role seem strange but he does well with what he is given. Kingsley and Grodin are very enjoyable in their roles for different reasons and again it is strange to see Linney in a very small role given her later fame. The film is packed with cameos from politics and Hollywood, although the non-US viewer will struggle to recognise many of the congressmen etc (in fact, could US viewers name these people) but the standout cameo of the film goes to Oliver Stone who, in the film's funniest moment, allows his famous paranoia/conspiracy theory reputation to be lampooned on Larry King!Overall this is a politically naïve, rather preachy bit of liberal wish fulfilment &#150; but to leave it at that is to miss the point of the film. While it is this, it is also an amusing little comedy that delivers a warm glow as we see the story of Dave &#150; a politician the like of which we will probably never see outside of a cinema. Enjoy it for what it is, have a warm fuzzy feeling for a bit, then forget it for the thin comedy that it is.

Like King Ralph, DAVE pokes fun at government. What happens when you put a funny character in a position where he has to be a leader among men. The leader of a nation. Like a Chaplin comedy, DAVE pokes fun at the class system and government.Kevin Kline does a wonderful job as a leading man. With a series of leading roles in minor films and being an Academy Award winner for a supporting role, DAVE was the film that made Kevin Kline leading man material. Keep your eyes open for Ben Stein at the end of the film. Don't forget now, this was 4 years before Win Ben Stein's Money came out on Comedy Central. "},{"Title":"Electile Dysfunction","Date":"3 March 2006","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" Rooted solidly in the We Can Dream, Can't We? mold, the Ivan Reitman-directed DAVE follows the adventures of a stand-in for the American President who tries to rectify the administration's shortcomings while in office - a grander fantasy than any cobbling from J.R.R. Tolkein. Despite the irony in trying to retain democracy's visage by inserting a man into the Presidential post without an election, writer Gary Ross has crafted a pleasant enough diversion, DAVE's excellent performances redeeming any conceptual constitutional glitches.Kevin Kline is such a marvel in both roles &#x96; as the real American President, Bill Mitchell and as his temp agency doppelganger, affable Dave Kovic &#x96; that never for a moment do we doubt that he is, in fact, two different people, even when both his personas (who look exactly alike, but give off wildly disparate auras of authority and sheepishness respectively) are sharing the screen.When Bill Mitchell suffers a stroke and goes into a coma (during a sexcapade with one of his secretaries), in order to keep the nation's peace of mind, oily Chief Of Staff, Bob Alexander (Frank Langella) and his rationalizing apprentice, Alan Reed (Kevin Dunn), secretly hustle lookalike Dave into the President's chair, crash-coaching him on public appearance and board meeting protocol. Alexander's agenda is to puppet Dave into handing over the Presidency to him, but conscientious Dave, oblivious to Alexander's machinations, sees an opportunity to do some good whilst ensconced in faux public office and (with the help of morose Charles Grodin &#x96; tautologous, I know) actually forges a more sturdy economic stance for America.Sigourney Weaver, as Mitchell's estranged wife, is thrown in to add unnecessary romantic subplot to an already-implausible story. (The day any First Lady divorces her President &#x96; keeping in mind that she not only divorces him, she divorces the life of unbridled enablement that comes with laying down with the Leader of the Free World - and shacks up with a temp agency lookalike who can offer her a ten-year-old Lexus as her primary mode of transport, you might as well jump on that schoolgirl you've had your eye on, for the Gates Of Hell are surely about to open and swallow humanity.) Though the politics of President Mitchell and Dave Kovic are never mentioned outright, Mitchell was painted as a Republican, whilst Dave was noticeably fashioned after beloved Democrat Clinton. And in hindsight, this proved to be the funniest thing about Mitchell's philandering, as it presaged Clinton's Monica-gate by a couple of years.The fact that the American populace can take the profligacy of the American Presidency for granted says something not about their vaunted freedom, but about their tolerance for mendacity. This society itself has set up nonsensical rules regarding marriage and fidelity, yet when demonstrated that those rules matter not, and that we can easily tolerate their infraction &#x96; even joke about it &#x96; what was the point of the rules (and their attendant penalties) in the first place? When an American President can perjure himself whilst simultaneously making us doubt exactly what having sex means, we have to ask ourselves, Are we actually all virgins, then? A scenario like Bill Mitchell setting up a lookalike to press flesh so that he can be elsewhere spanking flesh needs no rationalization or justification, we are so inured to governmental duplicity of this sort. Though no textbooks would own up to it, we KNOW that the President obviously has a harem on call, and though the lookalike ploy may be a stretch in the Real World, we can be sure that a goodly percentage of his business meetings are spent releasing his pent-up, world-broiling stress into some tart vessel bent over backwards for her country.Still, if this movie had been made before the Kennedy administration, someone would have been shot.In not promoting partisanship, the movie tries to illustrate what any politician can do if he were to unselfishly actually serve his country instead of himself. Refrain We Can Dream, Can't We? This is the naïve failing of the film; though Dave retains the innocence that allows him to pull off his budget-balancing antics with sincerity, do the film-makers truly believe this movie will work one iota towards compelling a soul-blackened politician (of any party) to be unselfish?Frank Langella is the only character even minimally portrayed as realistically as we know all politicians are, in their sin-charred, balrog hearts. Even the most beloved of statesmen (Kennedy, Jefferson, Roosevelt) are more likely to be tailored after the Frank Langella character than the Dave character, no matter *what* their public personas promoted.A faltering resolution and hokey wrap-up ruins what little promise the movie glimmered with in its middle act. The scheming Chief Of State gets impeached, the Good Guy Vice-President (Ben Kingsley &#x96; wholly mis-used in this film) is sworn into office as President, and the temp agency guy gets the President's ex-girl, a grand future of shopping at the 99c Store awaiting their low-income, patriotic selves&#x85; "},{"Title":"Great Comment","Date":"31 May 2002","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  This is a great movie starring Kevin Kline & Sigourney Weaver.

In this interesting flick, Kevin Kline plays an everyman who just happens to be a dead ringer for the president. When the president goes into a coma, he has to become the new president, possibly staying longer than expected. It's an interesting look at the world of politics, and the Bush presidency makes this movie all the more idealistic.There is sort of a perceptive aspect here that gives the movie its one problem - and that's only because of something that happened much later the presence in one scene of Arnold Schwarzenegger playing himself. When he ran for governor of California, Dave director Ivan Reitman backed him (and thus I lost all respect for Reitman).But that's pretty much negligible. This is truly an enjoyable movie, with great support from Sigourney Weaver, Frank Langella, Kevin Dunn, Ving Rhames, Ben Kingsley, Charles Grodin, Faith Prince, Laura Linney, Bonnie Hunt, and several real-life politicians playing themselves (Oliver Stone also appears and asserts that there's a conspiracy going on).

Well, you make an affable liberal actor take the President's place of course! Kevin Kline plays Dave, an affable temp agency owner who on his off-time likes to do small event impersonations of the President. As for his luck, he strikes an uncanny resemblance, a la the Prince and the Pauper, and is found by the Secret Service to be an ideal candidate for a decoy body while the President is off doing... confidential things.However, when the real President has a stroke, his advisors don't want to set off a national emergency... especially with a liberal vice-president around to think about. Thus they move Dave in a la The Hudsucker Proxy as the new President... but of course, Dave has a warm heart and an inspiration to try his hardest at everything he does, so... he goes at his job with the energy, charisma, and skill that everyone wants from the most powerful man in the world, even warming the angry scowl off of Susan Sarandon's face! Of course like most cathartic entertainment like this, it's not so much about the actual presenting of ideas on how to solve all the problems (some hints on where to start are made), but more a vehicle for opening up the minds of the audience to the possibility of TRYING to make the world a better place. You can't get answers from it, but dreams, so dream hard. Don't worry, Ving Rhames will grow to like you.The true entertainment from this comes from Kline. His acting is wonderfully physical and involved, and bleeds a sincerity to the common man, the salt of the Earth, that keeps the audience cheering for him the entire way.--PolarisDiB "},{"Title":"Not funny","Date":"9 August 2002","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  This movie had such potential to be an hilarious slapstick with perhaps some satirical wit about the US government, but it reduces itself to an unfunny, banal farce about a double.

Look for instance to the music; it's like the soundtrack of a documentary about the goodness in the world ! The cinematography is smooth. The characters are polished. And everything is damn tame. I worried about sliding over the furbished *icy* surface ! The writing is usual at best. I wanted any crazy scene, to have none. Save (Kevin Kline) moment of God bless you, God bless AMERICAAA! and (Oliver Stone) cameo, I didn't recognize anything comic around. The lost opportunities for making laughs are many (meeting the president and the first lady in the street to just singing Tomorrow is so obvious one). Simply as a funny movie it's soulless.Then, more writing problems; for one, cutting down the budget seemed too easy. And if it was intended to satirize some of the White House unwise policies, then why the script didn't extend the line, to see some fixes where the good-heartedness and patriotism would lead rightly?!To add more ice, (Frank Langella) did his worst acting ever, or non-acting to be specific. OH MY GOD, as if he was determined on giving no reaction at all to the camera. He hated his role? The movie? The producer? Himself ??! I don't know but one thing; if he was replaced with a stone, it would have been nicer ! The rest of the cast did their jobs inside very limited areas caused by uncreative script and direction. For instance (Ben Kingsley) wasn't allowed to do anything good; comic or serious. And for more painful instance let me say that (Kline) acted the character of the unreal president as funny as the character of the real one ! In brief, instead of laughing, I watched a conventional movie about how the ordinary citizen could rule a country ideally by only his own simplicity and innocence. That, according to the movie's story and actors, was disappointing. I felt it as a school film, or a presidential speech, about doing the right thing mistaken for a comedy ! Among other remakes of (The Magnificent Fraud &#x96; 1939), (Dave) is the coldest. Despite its elegance it fails in amusing. The thing is this movie was too rational to a boring degree.

In Moon Over Parador for example. Or I don't know how many others. The plot isn't important. The idea someone is finally going to do some good in a high administrative office is. At this rate, even I Can Happen To You qualifies as a look-alike.Reitman is good and the cast are great, but I wish Sigourney wouldn't play poisonous evil so over the top. She's too evil - and the spell doesn't break until a lot later (and then it breaks nice).And there's always someone threatening the one in power. And above all there is this naive attitude that if you just want to bad enough, you can do anything. You can cut through the noise and accomplish what no one before has ever accomplished.And Kline says as much in one of his speeches. People don't even care anymore. They understand intuitively there is nothing they can do, so they just go through the motions. Kline wants to change that. A lot of people would like to change that. But this is a Hollywood film.And Hollywood films prey on getting people to believe, albeit for a short time, that the impossible is not only possible but an imminent reality. Like when you watched JR pour a bourbon and branch you weren't interested, truly interested, in the tragic family dynamics of the Ewings; you just wanted to be in that room for a while, that luxurious room, be in that life for a while, pouring a bourbon and branch. It's a dream. Hollywood sell dreams.Which would be less tragic (and less profitable) if the reality were not so stark as it is. Reality is that this is lip service to ideals no one will show any respect - it's the same old thing, with the left hand helping the right people - at least in the hyper-confused US - will never have a decent government, so make a fantasy about how they someday do. It's not real.Is there a deeper message to this movie? I doubt it.

In the movie, Dave wins the first lady's heart by saving $650 million dollars for a program to help the homeless, which the bad guys wanted to slash from the budget. Pause for a moment and consider that, according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the federal government spent $2.9 billion for federal homeless programs in 2009. It makes you realize that maybe the real problem isn't that the federal government doesn't spend enough to solve homelessness, maybe instead it's that federal homeless programs aren't really all that well administered or maybe just not really all that effective.What if it's not the bad guys who are the problem? What if at least some of the guys in charge are every bit as well-intentioned as Dave but the problem is that their good intentions are ineffective, or maybe even counterproductive? Dave is a lighthearted comedy with some funny bits, but it also is an unabashed propaganda film which advocates vast expansion of the federal government as a panacea for all social and economic ills.I'd love to see a Libertarian version of this film where Dave gets into office and slashes the federal budget to the bone, fires all the czars, ends the War on Drugs, eliminates the Department of Education and the Department of Homeland Security, abolishes affirmative action, ends agricultural subsidies, privatizes social security, vastly simplifies the tax code, and returns the nation to its constitutional foundation.
