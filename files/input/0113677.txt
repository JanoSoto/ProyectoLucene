Buscemi, who is one of the prime character actors of the past fifteen years, has that range of being grounded, of being out of control, of being funny, and of being sincere even in the strangest circumstances. His character, as the quintessential indie film director of the film, tries to keep some control on what goes on, but as is seen, things don't go quite as planned.Living in Oblivion is one of those little delights for a film buff to see, or perhaps of a particular film buff. On a personal level I connect with some of this as I was a production assistant on indie films that were not far off from this. DiCillo, whether or not you've been in situations like this (which most of us haven't) brilliantly captures the coldness on a set, the uncomfortableness, the technical difficulties, and just the plain old emotional toll that goes on with the film-making process (notably, when it's under a million dollars being made). That it's a comedy of errors helps a lot, and that you never really know which way the story will turn at times. The film is split up in three acts, the first (for me) being the strongest and most affecting, as Nick tries to direct Catherine Keener's Nicole Springer in a heartfelt talk with her mother. Multiple takes bring on more woes, until Nick finally snaps (one of the funniest scenes perhaps in any film from the 90's). The other two segments come closer to being as great, one being a slick scene involving a buff man and Nicole, and the other being a very strange dream that has some kinks to work out.I've seen this film now several times, and the first time my enjoyment was more in the surface comedy of it all, and of course the performances. But with each passing view I get more and more what film-making, and what makes 'indie films' or just films in general, so appealing- there's drama, but there has to be some humor to get in the seams; there's romance, but not always in the ways you'd expect; when it's realer, more power to it. The ending also, while maybe the weaker part of the film, is still charming, and gives an idea as to what pleasures can come from such chaos on the set. I love it.

Yet, what is dream and what is real, you don't realize till they wake up.Buscemi plays Nick Reve (Reve in french means Dream), the frustrated trying to get it right director, and you know by Murphy's Law that when he shouts ACTION! something will go wrong. It is amusing yet almost annoying as we get to be frustrated with Buscemi's character, and after that, it appears that it was just a dream.The character of the arrogant actor Chad Palamino played by James LeGros, resembles Brat Pitt in appearance. It is said that Pitt was cast for this role, and since he was busy with another project, LeGros was chosen. Some say that Palamino's character might be Tom DiCillo's way of portraying Pitt's behavior on the set of his debut film Johnny Suede in 1991. Dicillo denies it. The pearls of this film* The scene where Palamino shouts The only reason I took this part was because someone said you were tight with Quentin Tarantino!, which is a role model for success in the indie film industry since Tarantino is the recent indie filmmaker that became a star director. * The transition from monochrome to color and vice-versa as a difference between reality and film reality, a lovely gimmick.* The 30 second Room Tone scene, where everybody is fantasizing about their life dream. This film is a treat for filmmakers and in general a fun film. People who are not filmmakers will enjoy this film as well. The film is only 91 minutes and I wanted more.

Johnny Suede was a failure with both critics and viewers but an artist can learn from any experience however disappointing or devastating it is. DiCillo wrote a short story from his frustration and turned his experience into a smart, funny, playful, and highly enjoyable second feature Living in Oblivion that takes place during one day of shooting a low budget film. Photographed with the color-to-black-and-white transitions, Living in Oblivions has surreal, strangely poetic and amusing quality to it.The cast is solid and consists of DiCillo's friends who are the regulars in his films. Steve Buscemi, the king of independent movies, in the rare starring role, plays Nick Reve, a long-haired, dedicated but frustrated director who in the moments of creative inspiration has to get back to earth and to deal with the tensions between his leading lady (Catherine Keener, before her star-making turn in Being John Malkovich but already a wonderfully talented beautiful and sexy actress) with whom he is silently in love and the male star, arrogant egotist Chad Palomino (James LeGros does an un-flattering but hilarious and quite accurate impersonation of the real life model for Chad).

It follows the always corpse-like Steve Buscemi as a director just trying to film two scenes in a seemingly awful low-budget independent production that has the distinction of snaring a megastar who is trying to build cred played by Brad Pitt look (sorta)-alike James LeGros. The Pitt character (the comically named Chad Palomino) is pure satire of the spoiled star who believes their least inventive whim is pure genius while the others are fleshed out to the extent that we get a look into their interior lives, anxieties and to some degree hopes. There are extended dream sequences, some attempts at Spinal Tap-esque humor (and the smoke machine went crazy!!!!) and a whole lotta characters tossing F-bombs at one another (shocking!!!). Everyone on the set has slept with a least one other person, Buscemi's addled mom shows up and the whole mess tries way too hard to be either funny or poignant or insider hip or something. If you ever wanted to see Buscemi try to carry a film or if like to feel hip by picking a movie that makes fun of movies themselves you might enjoy this -- I didn't. If you want a movie about movie-making, try Hooper, the 1978 Burt Reynolds vehicle about stuntmen making movies. Believe it or not, there was a (really brief) time when Burt Reynolds was so bankable that studios would sign a blank check and let he, Hal Needham, Dom Deluise, Mary Lou Henner, sometimes Sally Fields and random celebrities like quarterback Terry Bradshaw or drunk (may he rest in peace) Dean Martin just go out and wing it in front of the camera.

What this film reveals to us is not only the problems and the stress that comes about with all film making, but that which is generally connected with making low budget films.What sets low budget films apart from other normal films is that because there is a huge limit on funds available, other things are needed to draw the crowds, such as real characters and experimental filming techniques. This film begins in black and white, but when the filming begins, the film switches to colour. In the next section, it is the opposite, with the normal sequences being in colour and the filming sequences in black and white.Living in Oblivion is divided into three parts, and each of these parts a different scene is being filmed. The whole goal of this movie is that a scene in the movie is filmed, and Nick (Steve Buschemi), the director, seems to always run into problems when the filming begins. The way DiCillo makes the movie, which is very similar to what he did in Johnny Suede, leaves you wondering what is real and what is not. He is very clever with his dream sequences as they are indistinguishable from reality, except that everything ends up destroyed. Yet, the dream sequence in the film that is being made is the opposite, with smoke machines and dwarfs.The lead actors in the film are also important. One is a struggling actress who only did a shower scene in a Richard Geare movie. The famous actor is a complete snob and wants everything done his way, and he prances around acting as if he owned the entire movie. It seems that DiCillo is making a comment about actors who think that they make movies and without them the movie wouldn't exist. It is interesting that a Hollywood writer said that there is no such thing as a bankable product, and just because an actor is popular, doesn't mean that he is going to make millions from a movie.Living in Oblivion is a type of movie that I like because it focuses on characters and the relationships that cause problems. The director is not afraid to experiment, nor make comments about people, such as famous actors. Mostly, he tries to reveal to us what it really is like on a set of a low budget movies, and the problems that they face.

We embrace them as our own special offspring. It's an irrational attachment we have for them, like kidnapping our neighbor's child. But cinema, apparently, is some sort of expression of our collective desire to be acknowledged, to be contributing to the public conversation. That's a bizarre, absurd role to demand of independent films, of any film, but that's the weird world we've been born into, isn't it? The ignored, unnoticed independent film is often the container and conveyor of our most salient, real desires. Frustration and anxiety are palpable, ever present qualities of modern life, and low budget films should not be exempt. Tom DiCillo has incorporated these discomforting, disturbing qualities into his poignantly absurd film. The production of the film within the film is at the mercy of unpredictable, arbitrary forces, like malfunctioning smoke machines, incompetent crew members, emotionally distracted actors, and just plain bad luck. Nothing is as effortless and perfect as it is in the real movies. This revelation elevates this film into the realm of essential; essential for anyone who is considering making their own independent low budget film, and essential for any fan of quality non Studio, non mega budget films.That it can be so impossible just getting a single scene into the can &#x97; the expression for capturing on film a worthwhile moment &#x97; is a potent metaphor for all our own endeavors. We are continually assaulted with the infinite demands of our mundane lives but are so wiling to sacrifice so much of our precious time to the act of getting it just right, whatever it may be. We need to be succeeding at something, anything, in order to feel worthy. And maniacal persistence is the indispensable means to success. However, it's usually a non productive hobby, past time or diversion that occupies us so insistently.Living in Oblivion is a rare opportunity to examine this impulse of ours to perfect relatively minor, inconsequential things. The conceit of the film is that we, the audience, like to believe that we are above and beyond such tedious, temporal concerns, yet we are equally, undeniably fascinated by the intricacies of the inner film's creation. How would I do it? is a question that frames every scene. But our involvement is irrelevant. That's the paradox at this film's core. That's the ultimate message here, that we, the audience, are inconsequential. That might sound bleak and morose to some, but I found it deeply satisfying. I am not responsible, in the end, for this film's success. I am only watching.Tom DiCillo has earned a reputation as an iconoclast, as a rebel, as an anti establishment defender of the individual. I'm not sure just how justified is this reputation - he has lately directed arguably crappy TV such as Law and Order - but still, he proves himself a potent source of genuinely profound insights in this film. You will learn what it feels like to be an ambitious, hopeful, idealistic artist working in a crass, indifferent, commercial world. That's a rare treat.The fact that Steve Buschemi, Katherine Keener, and Dermot Mulroney are so wonderfully natural is proof that Dicillo has golden instincts. We are granted access to these artist's most transcendent talents. I've seen them all in many different, fantastic roles, but here they are at their absolute best, their most real. That's a quality that nearly all films aspire too, but so very few achieve. Enjoy this film for this commendable fact along with the knowledge that it's nearly impossible to make a film like this today or ever again. (David Lynch did it in 2006 with his Inland Empire which has been ignored by the general film going public. It's a monumentally original, powerful, revolutionary film experience. Charlie Kaufman also accomplished a tremendous feat of originality with his phenomenal Synecdoche, NY from 2008. Both films are subtle expressions of artistic desire in the face of a coldly indifferent, if not outright maliciously violent culture.)

When that dwar-- ... erm, vertically disadvantaged person walks around Catherine Keener with his apple for the twentieth time, this otherwise trivial scene just cracks you up.

It's an insider's look at the world of film-making, wherein everything that can go wrong on a set does go wrong, from actors who forget their lines, to unwanted, extraneous noise, to fragile egos among the various stars. The film clearly makes the point that life on set of an independent film is tedious, grueling, and frustrating.The film starts off in B&W, then changes to color, then switches back and forth between B&W and color. Most of the scenes are indoors, and consist of simple, basic film sets; there are almost no outdoor shots. Parts of the plot consist of various dream sequences; this can get a tad confusing, but I guess it really doesn't matter, since the entire story is a fantasy anyway; one might even construe this ambiguity as a homage to Fellini's classic film 8 1/2.Living In Oblivion is billed as a comedy. Indeed, there are some funny segments as, for example, when Chad Palomino (you gotta love that phony Hollywood name), the hotshot stud with the huge ego, tries to out-direct the director. On the other hand, the film's plot can be irksome when it becomes repetitive. Numerous takes of the same scene not only are frustrating for Nick; they're frustrating to us viewers as well.This film gets points from me for being different. I also like the film's theme of crew collaboration. Overall, Living In Oblivion makes a good effort at showing what life is like on a movie set. That's a perspective that most outsiders probably will find interesting.

Relationships are falling apart, actors aren't acting, stars aren't starring and the crew seem more intent on getting in front of the camera rather than staying behind it.In Tom Dicillo's perfect satire on the troublesome process of movie making, the comedy of errors that transpires is one of the funniest that has ever been put on celluloid, with Steve Buscemi flawless and hilarious as the director having a nightmare as events conspire to spoil his film. The dialogue is so damn good that it becomes the kind of quotable fare that just filters into your regular daily language.

The narrative of a film within a film dissects the difficulties experienced during the process of creating an independent motion picture, set with a focus upon cinema's dichotomy between the director as the creative author and film being a collective effort spilt between many hands. While the narrative's structure (conflict/climax/resolution) is paced and moved by the soap opera-esquire exchanges amongst the cast and crew of the project, it is still unsure if DiCillo believes that cinema's nature is either of the aforementioned, but rather a synergy of the two. He makes arguments for both cases, showing how the multi-faceted approach to film-making can slow/change the intended vision and that the director can also not understand how to portray his own vision. As a conclusion Dicillo posits the idea that the ends, more or less, justifies the means. That a film can be made in many different ways, in many different hands and the same juvenile disputes, short comings, technical problems will be met along the way. This is not to suggest that these means are not important, Dicillo's makes them the entire plot of Living in Oblivion, but he rather he wants to give a window for an audience to view (while dramatized) into the world of film production. While this is a seemingly contradictory statement, Living in Oblivion is a contradictory movie, and DiCillo leaves the audience with the feeling that a film has been made and the future of that film will in no way reflect the journey the cast/crew took to get it there.

We have been subjected to some real dross over the years but 'Living in Oblivion' is the proverbial exception to the rule, in that it isn't merely a conglomeration of funny disasters but they are assembled around a rather ingenious idea. As with every flick about film-making you have the different levels of the movie itself and the film that is in the making. This allows the director to switch between those different realities and blur the line between what is real and what might be merely a reproduction of reality. The basic location is a low budget film set run by a fairly incompetent and neurotic staff and apart from all the technical difficulties, true disaster strikes when the human factor raises its ugly head. The film can be roughly divided in three parts. In each part, hopelessly overworked director Nick Reve tries to cope with all the problems that can and inevitably will occur on any set and tries to prevent the whole thing from falling apart. With moderate success I might add. I don't know if you have to be interested in film making as such or if you even have to have some first hand experience to relate to this movie but I would have thought that its all kind of self explanatory. Although we would never have suspected it, the first two parts are dream sequences, thus giving the whole thing another level and hence another layer of reality, whilst the last one depicts the shooting of a dream sequence in real life. Quite clever methinks. However, the line between dream and reality is not quite as clear as you might think cause occurrences and events from the first two parts lead to what will happen in the third. All this is rather clever but what makes this an utter delight from start to finish is the directors eye for detail, how the whole thing just builds up and the great cast that is kinda stereotyped but spot on nevertheless. From the crappy catering and the bossy floor manager to the vain actor and the arty farty director everything fits just perfectly to depict an authentic scenario of underground film-making. I'm not really into comedies as such but I laughed out loud on several occasions during 'Living in Oblivion'. I really enjoyed it all the way through, but then maybe I'm a bit biased as Steve Buscemi is one of my favourite actors.

Things like that are even in Nick's dreams and in the dreams of his main actress, Nicole (Catherine Keener), so Nick must deal with the problems of making low-budget films.Living in Oblivion, the second film written & directed by Tom DiCillo, is one of the most original films that i have ever seen and is an hilarious and strange low-budget comedy about low-budget film-making. The film is divide in three parts showing the dreams of Nick and Nicole and one real scene of Nick's film. But is all fun with this director and his bizarre crew dealing with a Hollywood star (James LeGros) who wants to change the film and with the mother of Nick (Laurel Thomby) who is interfering with the filming. The dreams are just how Nick and Nicole would love to deal with a problematic situation like that, Nick insulting everyone and Nicole ruining the Hollywood star and falling in love with Nick. But for me the most surrealistic sequence is actually the real one of the film with Nick's mother acting better than the real actors.Basically the plot is really simple, showing a lot of takes of the three different scenes but there is always a different detail for every single take and a different reaction of the great characters, you will be asking now, what's next? what could f*ck more the film of Nick?The cast is just superb; for me this role ranks in Steve Buscemi's top five, and that's a really difficult decision because he is an amazing actor with many memorable characters like Mr. Pink, Donny or Seymor from Reservoir Dogs, The Big Lebowski and Ghost World. I really love this character that was based upon Buscemi's own experiences during his first attempts of making his debut film Trees Lounge. The supporting cast is amazing too, with the lovely Catherine Keener as a not very famous actress who's major recognition was a shower scene in a Richard Gere film. James LeGros is really funny as Chad Palomino, the Hollywood star who works with Nick just because he think Nick was tight with Quentin Tarantino. And Dermot Mulroney as Wolf, the loyal camera man who is always supporting Nick.Conclusion Tom DiCillo was used to this kind of situations due to the difficult filming of his debut film, in Living in Oblivon he creates an hilarious parody of low- budget films that all the cinema lovers must check. This film is one my personal favourites of the 90's and maybe ever and is a gem of low- budget film-making. 10 out of 10DVD this film is practically unknown in Mexico so i have to order this DVD.

Things start going wrong right from the get-go when Reve tries to shoot a one-shot dolly in on a scene where Nicole (Katherine Keener) and Cora (Rica Martins) are daughter and mother emoting about a past event in the family. As the action progresses we discover that those in charge of making the film within the film are less than capable to the task. Things reach a nerve-wracking level when we suddenly discover that we are inside the nightmare of the director, and the action begins again. Later to complete a fantasy section for the film a dwarf actor is hired, Tito (Peter Dinklage) to act in a scene with Nicole, but things keep going wrong with adverse reactions to the script and Nick's direction. We're never sure if the movie gets finished but old wounds get salved and another day of creating is successfully completed.It's the little touches in the film that make this inside joke such a pleasure.Highlights are the scene with Nicole and Cora, where we feel that real emotion is being observed and something pure is artistically derived, only to be sidetracked by the incompetent bumbling of the comedy of errors that make up the film crew.Another great section is the one where Nicole and Chad are trying to finish a scene after having sex the night before and carrying all the baggage from that involvement onto the set, with all the accompanying vulnerabilities standing in their way of connecting creatively.The other great section is when we discover that Cora, the mother character of the character in the film within the film earlier, is really the director's own mother. Confused? It's all very funny once you start putting it all together in your own mind.There are some really great quotable lines in this comedy. When you want to really insult an actor call him a Hostess Twinkie Mother F*****- you get it when you see the movie.Another great bunch of lines Chad Palomino Ya know the only reason I took a part in this movie is because someone said you were tight with Quentin Tarentino.

The only place I seen dwarfs in dreams is in stupid movies like this! Although the movie Living in Oblivion will appeal specifically to film-connected people and those who have attempted to create a crew-involved film, even normal people will find laughs in it.You'll come back to this film again and again to look at single scenes to laugh at the stuff that goes on.

Knowing this, one should find it surprising that the average person knows little to nothing about what actually goes on during the production of a movie, nor does he or she understand how much backbreaking work is put into even the most abysmal features.  For the uninitiated, Tom DiCillo's 1995 feature Living in Oblivion will serve as a both an education in filmmaking and a wake-up call to better appreciate an art form many of us take for granted.  It can also be seen as a light-hearted warning to those who are considering a career in the movie industry, or as a refreshing, close-to-home satire to those already involved.To briefly summarize, Living in Oblivion is a film about the making of a film--an independent, low-budget drama with the same title.  Steve Buscemi plays Nick Reve, the film's hopelessly frustrated, strung-out director who's just trying to make it through the shoot in one piece.  The many hurdles--both technical and personal--that come with the territory of shooting a low-budget picture are depicted in a way that is unnervingly realistic, yet absolutely hilarious at the same time.  We learn right from the get-go that filmmaking is one of those ventures where anything that can go wrong will, and Nick Reve's movie is certainly no exception.Aside from just being well-acted, the characters in Living in Oblivion are very original and complex.  I found such depth in character to actually be somewhat surprising, since the movie's premise is relatively simple, and much of the character development isn't really needed for the jokes to work.  But the fact that DiCillo has incorporated a distinct personality and back-story into all of the main parts really helps add to not only the believability of the characters and their actions, but to the viewer's emotional attachment to them as well.  Even though we're laughing, we can feel Nick's aggravation as take after take is blown by one minor difficulty or another, and by the time he finally cracks and vows not to finish the production, the audience shares in the disappointment of the onscreen crew, who have been giving their all to make sure that this film makes it to completion.  As viewers, we can see that Nick's production is really nothing more than a tacky romantic drama, but because it is a labor of love, we develop a relationship with it anyway, and are therefore genuinely saddened during those few moments when all hope is lost.Living in Oblivion is also rife with imagery and visual effects that help to punctuate its mood as well as the characters' relationships with one another and with Nick's movie itself.  The first third of Oblivion (Nick's dream sequence) is in black and white, while the scenes of his production are shown in color.  To me, this represents Nick's total devotion to the project.  This movie is everything to him (it is `the light', so to speak), and showing its scenes in color juxtaposed with the stark black and white shots to represent reality help illustrate his passion for his work.  Conversely, Nicole's (the lead actress, played by Catherine Keener) dream sequence uses the exact opposite technique, showing the movie's scenes as black and white, while reality is in color.  Again, this helps to justify her relationship with the picture-reluctant and detached.Living in Oblivion may appear simple and unremarkable on the surface, but appearances can be deceptive!  Hidden within the film's straightforward storyline and seemingly pessimistic humor lies a very clever look at the human need for involvement, power, passion, and triumph.  It may be difficult to pick up at first, but repeated viewings will tell you that this is undoubtedly more than just a `movie about a movie'.

The rest of the cast are also a joy to watch. DeCillo regular Catherine Keener ('Being John Malkovich'), her real life husband Dermot Mulroney, who has sadly been wasted in mediocre mainstream crap for most of his career, the wonderful James LeGros ('Drugstore Cowboy') as an incredibly egotistical artiste, cult figure Kevin Corrigan ('Bandwagon'), who Buscemi later cast in his directorial debut 'Trees Lounge', and Danielle von Zerneck, who I eventually placed as Lou Diamond Phillips love interest in 'La Bamba' back in the 80s. (She's great and I would like to see her in more films as good as this one). 'Living In Oblivion' is a rarity these days - a genuinely funny film. Highly recommended to anyone who has enjoyed a low budget movie and wondered how it got made.

His Ren-like pop eyes and ferocious anger give life to the on-the-brink-of-a-nervous-breakdown director character and the scene towards the beginning of the film where he snaps and tells everyone on the set what he thinks of them gives a viewer a words-cannot-describe feeling of incredibly inspiring bliss.  It would be a one-note performance if he played Nick Reve as manic all the way through the film but he adds layers of vulnerability and plays the humanity instead of the schtick making the nervous humor burn and stay with you.  It's a quality he brings to every part he plays and is very visible in his best work Parting Glances, Fargo, Trees Lounge, and especially Ghost World.Catherine Keener and Dermot Mulroney are also very good here but James Le Gros as the Brad Pitt-inspired Chad Palomino (great name!) is just too good to be true!

I laughed harder than I did at any other movie in a long while, but I was also stunned by the film's striking originality and moving beauty.  Anyone who has ever been interested in indie film, especially directing it, will find it to be touching and fascinating.     Steve Buscemi is in top form as a young independant filmmaker who strives to produce a cheesy, yet visionary art film about a woman's marriage.  Its characters are all symbolic to the creator's life, and the use of dreams always keep you in a state of wonder and always interested.     I found hope once again in DiCillo.  He truly is a genius.

After a restless night of dreaming of various problems that will plague him, he wakes up to go to the set.  With a relatively easy shot due for the day, it is surprising how much can go wrong.  Not to mention the fact that some of the others have had the same sort of restless night.  They all come together in a typically low rent day on the set of an independent film.It's hard to summarise the story here because the film simply doesn't really have one over the summary `the trials of a low budget shoot'.  The film gets around this by having two dream sequences before actually getting to the main shoot - but the two dreams are essentially the same `things go wrong on shoot' ideas.  The fact that the film still manages to work despite this is to it's credit.  The film is a funny and realistic look into the shoot of Nick's movie with all the problems that come with it.  I wouldn't say it was hilarious or outrageously funny but it is engaging and amusing.The writing is what makes it work, as it brings out the sense of frustration and sheer basic aims of making a film on that level.  Like I said it manages to be amusing but never stretched to the point where it is farcical.  The cast all know a bit about low budget movies, especially Buscemi who is very good here.  Keener is a great actress and she is also good - her acting in the first dream sequence is really good as she slowly turns her performance off in front of the camera.  Mulroney is good but it is LeGros who really steals his section as the inflated actor who can't just do as he's told and is a pain to work with - supposedly DiCillo based this character on his experiences working with Brad Pitt.Overall this is a tight and amusing little film that captures the frustrations and realities of the low budget shoot.  The plot may not be up to much and it certainly could have kept going for much longer than 90 minutes but it is still worth seeing. "}]
