Predator-1 had more Arnie than Predator. This movie simply has more Predator. It also greatly expanded the Predator universe and franchise. It introduced a whole new bunch of Pred weapons, tactics and behavior which never ever seemed out of place and were perfect fits. It explored their race further. All these were added to full effect in the AvP and AvP-2 PC games which were smash hits so imagine how horrible it would be if this movie never happened? The urban (steel jungle?) setting contrasts against the previous jungle setting and is a major plus for this movie. This movie was also extremely realistic and gory. All in all, this movie is fantastic and a few ignorant critics just want to bring it down by comparing it with the uniqueness of the original.

I know I'm going to get hurt for saying this, but I actually think I like Predator 2 just as much, if not more than the original Predator.  I'm not sure, but I kind of think that I saw Predator 2 first, which may be the reason, but I think the true reasons are the followingI loved that the Predator has more weapons, and the action sequences were more interesting.In this film they do a much better job developing and explaining the Predator.  This isn't just a crazy beast that kills things left and right.  This is an intelligent being that is looking for a good hunt.  I love that the Predator doesn't attack anyone that he doesn't consider a threat or isn't a challenge.  I LOVE that he has compassion and respect for an expectant mother.I have to say there are only 2 or 3 little things that I didn't like about the movie, but they aren't anything I can't deal with.  I wasn't too fond of the Predator being struck by lightning...sure, it looks cool, but don't you think that would hurt him pretty bad?All in all, I genuinely LOVED this movie!  I don't know what is is about this movie that just doesn't sit well with a lot of the reviewers on this site, but I loved it.

I almost always to prefer to watch film series in order, but as the Predator films are not constructed as chapters in a novel, there may be some advantage to watching Predator 2 first--namely that the Predator itself is explained much better in this film, so it might help viewers fill out unstated backstory for the first film.Set in a future 1997 (the film was released in 1990), we're shown a Los Angeles suffering from both a mounting heat wave and mounting anarchy. Lieutenant Mike Harrigan (Danny Glover) is a rule-breaking, short-tempered downtown cop. He works closely with Danny Archuleta (Ruben Blades), Leona (Maria Conchita Alonso) and recent transfer Jerry Lambert (Bill Paxton), all eccentrics in their own way, and all but Danny equally rule-breaking. The film begins with a Colombian drug gang engaging in a shoot-out with the cops. The police finally manage to defensively drive them into a building, but when they at last converge on the gang, it seems that somebody, or something, else has finished the job for the police. More drug gangs are attacked, and it seems as if there may be some kind of vigilante on the loose. But when a secretive government task squad, headed by Peter Keyes (Gary Busey), enters the picture and takes increasingly odd actions, it seems that something even more bizarre may be responsible (a fact also given away by the film's title, it's relationship to the Predator series, and obvious shots involving the titular character early in the film).For my tastes, Predator 2 is an example that breaks the supposed trend that sequels are never as good as their predecessors. I think Predator 2 is a brilliant film, better than the first film by two points. This one is a 10 out of 10 for me.Let's get the more obvious comments out of the way first. As a horror and sci-fi leaning crime actioner, director Stephen Hopkins and writers Jim and John Thomas have created a fast-paced, exciting, visceral film. This is a story set against burgeoning anarchy and chaos is a gang-filled urban environment, and Hopkins appropriately never decreases the intensity of the film--we barely pause to take a breath. While that may be exhausting to some viewers, and the rapid pacing might lead some to confusion, anyone with a taste for action films should love it, plus the genre-melding is accomplished without a hitch.The cast is quirky and excellent. Keep in mind that I have a taste for surrealism, camp, absurdism, and so on, so that makes me appreciate the acting in the film even more. I'm a big Bill Paxton fan. His performance in Predator 2 is a good example why. I also like Danny Glover a lot, and he turns in a great performance. Additionally, we have Gary Busey, one of the odder actors in Hollywood (just watch his comments on the DVD extras)--a fact that to me always pleasantly comes through in his characters, and the incomparable Morton Downey, Jr., basically playing his real life television talk show personality, is even present as a guerilla journalist.The music, special effects and every other technical aspect are also excellent.But what makes this film even better is the brilliance beneath the obvious aspects. The Predator, because of his goals, is usually unseen, hidden or camouflaged in his unique way, and most of the time he's watching others. Thus, Hopkins permeates the film with images of voyeurism, hidden views, reflections, veiled appearances, and so on. There are tens of brilliant shots through windows and/or showing our primary visuals through reflections. The heat, which not only amps up the chaotic atmosphere of the film, also enables Hopkins to make everyone sweaty throughout most of the film. The sweat creates reflections. There is the regular presence of the media covering the story, being voyeurs on the film's action. Sometimes we see things through their cameras. There are a lot of televisions and computer screens throughout the film. There is a subtle theme of voyeurism via public display of personal snapshots. We become literal voyeurs, in the sexual sense, by watching the film for one brief scene. The L.A. police become voyeurs of the task force's actions. During the subway scene, much of the action becomes hidden because of a marvelous strobe light effect. I wouldn't doubt that if we watched the film with only this aspect in mind, we would probably find it present in some way in every scene, in nearly every shot.I know this film is sometimes panned, but it would be undeserved. It may be a case of the film being too hip for the room. In any event, you shouldn't miss Predator 2.

Predator is great, but part 2 is equally great. It may not be quite as primal and fast paced, but it more than makes up for it with well developed characters, a more detailed back story and compelling setting, and a deeply developed story. If the predator wasn't in this movie, the story set up would make for a great movie on its own.You may not realize it when you're watching it, but the climax of this movie is nearly 45 minutes long! Starting from the subway shoot out, the tunnel chase, the street-roof chase, the slaughter house fight, the roof top fight that spills into the apartment building across the street, the elevator shaft, and finally to the Predator ship itself. It is a breathless series of action sequences strung together so well that it's almost astonishing to look back on it and imagine such effort was crafted to make this movie.This movie would never be made today. A sequel without the main character from the fist movie? A whole new setting? This would be seen as too great a risk, but in 1990 movie studios were still run by creative people, not accountants. This movie is a true, unsung classic of sci-fi, coming from an age when great care was put into genre movies that had strong stories, good characters, and dialogue that didn't sound silly and forced. Lines weren't meant to become one-liners, they were just so memorable that they ended up that way.You can't see the eyes of the demon, until him come calling. Okay P-ssy face, it's your move. Danny Boy.And of course...Want some candy?Granted, those aren't as good as the classics from the first Predator, likeYou son of a bitch! I ain't got time to bleed. Knock Knock. Stick around.

Gang warfare rages between rival drug gangs with the police caught in the middle. During one shoot out the police led by Mike Harrington (Glover) trap 6 men in a building. Before they can act the 6 are violently killed and stung up by an unseen attacker. As more armed gangs are attacked and killed in similarly unexplained ways the police realise that a new element is attempting to muscle in on the existing gangs. Glover and his team begin to hunt the new gang until they are joined by a FBI unit who seem to know more about the gang than they let on.This follows on from the first movie well - not a forced sequel picking up from the last, but a different film that ties it's action in with previous events. None of the original stars return but the cast is full of name stars - Gary Busey, Danny Glover, Bill Paxton, Ruben Blades, Robert Davi. The plot is basically the same as the first - an unseen attacker attacks armed forces in the jungle - except here it's in the urban jungle, and it's actually pretty good.The plot has the core of the predator doing battle, but now has another string of the FBI/Gary Busey conspiracy which makes the film much more interesting. However all this is window dressing to the action scenes. Unfortunately this doesn't have as much slow tension as the first film, but rather has long raging gun battle throughout - this does tend to bring it down to the level of a standard action movie but it does have some standout scenes that lift the film. The strobing fight on the subway is the most effective but the battles between police, gangs and predator are also very well handled. Overall the action is great but could have benefited from more slow, tension building. That said this sequel doesn't make the mistake that other creature-feature sequels have made - this keep the Predator hidden even though we already know what it looks like. For the most part the Predator moves cloaked and we only really seek the consequences of it's actions rather than the whole beast revealed. This keeps a certain mystery and helps build a certain amount of tension.The final battle between hero and Predator is not quite as good as Schwarzenegger's confrontation with the alien, but is still a good finish to the film. It's easy to believe that Arnie could use the jungle and stealth to defeat the alien - but Danny Glover (Mr 3 days from retirement?) taking on the Predator in what is essentially an extended fist fight? Sorry - it's fun to watch but a little hard to believe.The performances are good, Glover gets to be a Riggs type rather than a Murtagh/retirement case. Paxton plays the energetic side kick and continues his killer-alien experience that he started in Aliens. Even Busey, now almost completely bereft of his star status and wallowing in video thrillers, is good here as a shadowy FBI agent. Sad to think that he got so good at this role that he got regularly typecast and is now doing things like Lethal Tender, Universal Soldier 2 and many others I've tried hard to forget. The rest of the cast do well as fodder for the predator but it's really all about the action.The film contains some nice touches that develop the Predator in the same way that Aliens took a step along from Alien. The feeling that the Predator has hunted across all worlds (including the aforementioned alien) is cool as well as some other things that you get from the ending that I wouldn't spoil. But the attempt to give the Predator a sense of mercy is a bit forced. In the first it wouldn't kill an unarmed person, i.e. it always wanted sport. Here this extends to it sparing the life of an armed police woman because she is pregnant, that just seemed a little out of character to me, but I understand why they did it.Overall this is a solid action movie with plenty of good scenes. When compared to the first movie it almost holds it's own but it lacks the sense of fear and being hunted that the first brought - this has tension but the first film have tension by the bucket.

The voodoo-gang's whole mystique, the hard music score, the attention for detail - the south-American influenced interior design of the drug-lord apartment or the interior of the alien ship(there are some hidden treats for the trained eye, like the alien skull and other interesting trophies) and not at least the creature's design are just a few examples for the stylish quality of this much better than the original sequel. Danny Glover brings a touch of real to the tough but human lead character while Bill Paxton(bad-mouthed as always-I just love this guy in everything he's done), Ruben Blades and Conchita Alonso are the flavor of this adrenalin ride.

I always liked the fact that Predator 2 is set in an urban environment, the jungle is too remote. Not enough prey you see. Although Los Angeles 1997 doesn't look like that then or now,(most parts anyway), the movie does a good job of putting the Predator in what I like to call a target rich environment. Danny Glover isn't Arnold but he does a good job as the lead anyway. Arnold didn't make the first movie good, the Predator did. I think a lot of you miss that.

Despite what the nay-sayers would have you believe, don't take their word for it. Predator 2 is every bit as wonderful as its great predecessor. I'm very surprised that people think that P1 was better than P2. Why? Because of the dialogue where Arnie goes 'We're not assassins, we're rescuers only' and people believing that BS? Please! My verdict &#150; Both Predator films are outstanding. It's just too bad that idiot Paul Anderson was the one who was in charge of directing the pathetic attempt at a 3rd movie. But then again, this isn't the place to discuss the trauma that was Alien Vs Predator. The action in P2 starts fast and furious from the very beginning. The characters are emotionally charged, with Danny Glover, Bill Paxton, Maria Alonso all giving good performances, with smaller characters, such as their captain and the police chief above him, still being decent characters who are played respectfully well by their actors. I suppose audiences nowadays want to see more of the stereotypical politician/idiot of a police captain and chief, and maybe they couldn't handle seeing a police chief who had justifiable gripes with his officer's behavior. At least that's my theory. ******MINOR SPOILER******* Gary Busey leads the other half of the cast, those being the federal agents who are out to freeze the predator and steal its technology. This is definitely Busey's best performance next to Lethal Weapon 1. His character's a hard@$$ who doesn't have the desire to talk to anyone who isn't within his tight-knit agency, so much so that it's obvious he's going through major pains when he finally cracks and tells Glover's character all he knows. Must've been hard for him. And oddly enough, Busy and Glover make a decent team, even if it was one that resembled two magnets that naturally act against each other. We find out a bit more about the predator's background. His ship was nice, ditto for his array of new weapons, and the ending where we see that predators had been on earth for centuries was cool. So they CAN speak English, hehehe ******END SPOILER******* And the bit where Glover's character greets Morton Downey Jr's as the latter is bugging him for comments after yet another series of murders? Beautiful -D My first minor gripe about this film is that there are a few too many expendables who show up simply to be chopped up by the predator. While the first movie had a small number of characters, so that every death was noticed and counted, the second one has literally dozens of cops, federal agents, drug dealers and civilians who encounter and are killed by the monster. That created some amount of de-sensitivity to the violence, which is bad, although the predator's victims are never forgotten by Glover's character as he relentlessly goes after the monster, which is good. My second gripe is that the villainous drug dealers are all one-dimensional, as there's nothing more to them than standard run-of-the-mill bad guys who kill with no regard for the sanctity of human life. It would've been nice if we had at least one drug dealer who had a positive side to him, just like the police officers' and federal agents' negative sides that were so superbly put on film. But then again, that's a problem that the first movie suffered from also &#150; showing 'terrorists' who kill for no reason, and who only exist to be exterminated by Arnie and Company's righteous soldiers.I suppose the reason for that is because the audience wants simplicity and the freedom to place people within Good and Evil labels, and doesn't want complicated social explanations that can turn a good person into a bad one. If only it was easy enough for me to say that it's just a movie and it shouldn't be taken more seriously than that, but it's not, as this is the image of 'evil drug dealers' and 'evil terrorists' that the ignorant masses see that makes it so easy for slimeball politicians to manipulate public opinion. But that's a whole different discussion altogether. To summarize &#150; we have locals cops on one side who want the predator's head for killing some of their own, and we have federal agents on the other side who want the predator's head so they can steal his technology, and lastly we have drug dealers who want everyone's head simply because those people exist. And the predator is running amok in the middle of it all. That makes this a great film. Just remember to keep in mind why Danny Glover's character is so outraged at the predator's killing of humans, because human life is supposed to be precious, and it's easy to forget that when so many characters in this film act otherwise. After all, we have enough people in the real world who think that life is cheap. No point in seeing fictitious characters who do the same. "},{"Title":"A vastly superior sequel.

He's in town with a few days to kill.' Has there ever a tagline cooler than this? I'm telling you there hasn't. Long, long, long underrated Predator 2 seems to be finally getting the recognition and respect it deserves. Why all of a sudden? Because when standing next to the extremely crap AvP, it looks like pure gold to those miserable cynics who disregarded it when it first came out because Arnie was not in it. Fair enough, a Terminator, Conan or even Commando film without Arnie just wouldn't work. But the 7-foot tall, Rastafarian, otherworldly hunter is the star of this film and this time round he gets much, much more screen time. We all know what the Predator is so Stephen Hopkins shows off this ace instead of hiding it up his sleeve.The year is 1997 and the City of Angels is boiling under a 109-degree heatwave. Columbian and Jamaican drug lords have turned the streets into a war-zone. The police are out-manned and out gunned and incompetent. The last thing they need to deal with is the Predator.The titular hunter has returned with an increased arsenal of weapons and is keen on slicing and dicing the aforementioned druggies for fun. During a brutal gun-battle on the streets he watches Lieutenant Mike Harrigan (Danny Glover), a slightly-crazed renegade cop, blow away half a dozen Columbian scumbags and chooses him as his ultimate prey. Naturally, Harrigan and his ethnically diverse team of cops have enough problems without having to worry about their skulls ending up in the Pred's intergalactic trophy cabinet.Making matters worse is faux-DEA Agent Peter Keyes (Gary Busey) who pretends to be after the druggies but is really more interested in swiping the Pred's advanced technology. Yeah, good luck with that! From start to finish Predator 2 is brash, unsubtle, in-your-face wall-to-wall action. A hectic, breathtaking succession of non-stop, increasingly exciting set-pieces. The final 45 minutes will you wetting yourself with excitement I kid you not. While Hopkins (fresh from his Nightmare on Elm Street 5 debut) has remained constantly employed he's never really become a star director, which is a shame since he has a slick, cartoonish style and is far more talented than most other anonymous directors. Like John McTiernan did in the first, he provokes a dusty, sweaty and overbearingly hot atmosphere in the daytime scenes and an alien, Gothic feel to night (pun intended). The way he captures LA on film just makes you NEVER want to go there.Fans of Alan Silvestri's score of the first film can take comfort in the fact that all of his cool themes are back (they were rudely ditched for AvP) and more evolved. It's probably the most engaging score he's done. His Latin drums, sinister, shrieking, Hermann-esquire strings, yawning, haunting urban sound effects and occultist voodoo chants dominate every scene and give each one its own unique voice.But it ain't just that. Everything from set-design and cinematography to sound-design and film editing is nothing short of brilliant. If you think I'm overreacting just watch the film and see for yourself. There's nothing mass-produced or conveyor-belt about Predator 2. Twentieth Century Fox chucked loads of money at it to make it the most sophisticated sequel it could be. Everyone involved seems to have made a huge effort and done their absolute best.It's sad that action films like this are not made anymore. Predator 2 is a classic, the kind of movie that feels torn straight from the pages of a 1950's pulp detective novel and crossed with a Twilight Zone episode. 10/10, no doubt.

They make the movies that don't have the 'directed by...' tag line at the end of the trailer or TV spots. Movie nerds know 'em and typically, we hate 'em. They are on the front lines of the b-grade genre crap with a-grade budgets we complain about all the time, directors for hire. And amongst them Stephen Hopkins, who has consistently given me the most entertainment out of the crappy movies he's made.Let's make things clear, Predator 2 is most definitely NOT better than it's previous film. The first film was a bare bones story made interesting by the expert direction by John McTeirnan, who ratcheted the tension up to then unheard of levels by sheer skill. He knew that GOOD action was always about the ANTICIPATION. Predator 2 however is a different beast.It's loud, in your face, and with more bits added on. It's dumber, with horrible(-y great) dialog and two dimensional characters wasting the talents of Danny Glover, Bill Paxton, and countless other unusually high profile actors. But that doesn't matter, this is a genre sequel, it's not about the talky-talky or character development, it's about the ACTION! And THIS is where we get to Stephen. He saves the film from what could've been a horrible nightmare of a flick. The guy knows how to stage a scene and make it interesting, and he keeps the film going at a quick pace so you don't have time to really think about the dumb parts, while still keeping it reigned in so things that NEED to make sense DO. The presentation of the Predator himself is actually one of the few things he did BETTER than the original. THIS movie's Predator knows how to make an entrance! And the action set pieces are exciting and expertly done (and makes ya pine for the days when an action scene was actually STAGED and DIRECTED and not just shot with a shaky camera). Simply put, it's a well shot movie.And that's what I've noticed this guy does. Predator 2, Ghost and the Darkness, Blown Away, Judgment Night. These aren't good 'films', but they're GREAT 'flicks'. They're fun and exciting, even if they aren't too bright. They're flaws skillfully overcome by the direction, something that I've yet to see Renny or Brett pull off.Now if you go into this movie LOOKING for something bad about it, you won't have to look far and it'll be a terrible experience for you. But if all you want is a good time and nothing else, you won't be disappointed.

Not so. Predator 2 is by far and away the superior example. Relentlessly bleak and gloriously violent, it is a far, far darker story than its 1987 forebear. Furthermore, it adds a whole new layer to the Predator mythos that wasn't fully covered in the original. Thanks to this film, we got some understanding of the Hunter's culture. They were revealed to be members of an honour bound society with their own castes and structures, rather than blood-letting monsters with no restraint to speak of. Alongside this is Danny Glover's powerful lead role, a vision of Los Angeles as the epicentre of violent culture clashes (foreshadowing the racial tensions that led to the 1992 riots) and some brutally relentless action sequences. And yet despite all this, it's still looked on as the lesser of two movies, when the only argument to suggest this is cos, you know, Arnie isn't in it is he?Set in the then-future 1997, Predator 2 negates the rain-forest location by pitting the Hunter into the concrete jungle of LA. The city is on the brink of collapse, torn apart by street wars between rival drug gangs. Fittingly, the film begins with an out-gunned police force struggling to deal with a trigger happy band of Mexican coke pushers. Arriving at almost the same time are the veteran police man Mike Harrigan (Glover) and the Hunter, who watches and waits, selecting targets to add to the trophy cabinet. One horrific burst of mechanised violence later and Harrigan has a mystery on his hands, involving mutilated corpses and an invisible killer who vanished into thin air. Setting out to solve the case, Harrigan and his fellow officers pursue the Predator while trying to deal with the drug lords and a Government team that knows more than they are telling. Then things get personal when one of Harrigan's friends is killed...Danny Glover is nothing short of brilliant in this film. Older and wiser but more out of shape than Arnie, he is a far more realistic opponent for the Predator to face than the Governator ever was and shows what happens when your average cop fights the alien, rather than a pumped up superman. No disrespect to Arnie, but Glover is also a better actor and inhabits his character completely, going about his job with the same reckless professionalism but also a sense of embittered frustration. Harrigan is no hero, he's just a man who's spent more time in the trenches than most.The Hunter meanwhile is still just as formidable in the second round. This one is a bit more headstrong than the first, not afraid to waltz into the middle of firefights and rip Jamaican gangsters to pieces, but also a bit more vulnerable. The city after all is unfamiliar terrain and Harrigan has mastered their environment, giving him an edge that he perhaps wouldn't have held in the wild. In true sequel fashion meanwhile, the Predator gets a wealth of cool new weapons to play with, including a net made of razor wire, a spear tip launcher and best of all, a shiny metal disc perfect for slicing FBI guys in half.Shame then that the supporting cast isn't quite so colourful as Dillon, Mac, Blaine et al. The eighties action heroine of choice, Maria Conchita Alonso makes a decent appearance as a ball busting cop and she is joined with her Aliens co-star Bill Paxton as the smooth newbie, but neither are as memorable as the commandos were. Thank God then for Gary Busey, chewing up the scenery as the head of the investigation team.Aside from that though, Predator 2 is definitely the better film. It's a lot grittier for one thing, the cartoon gore of the first replaced with some gruelling ordeals. It's also much darker, thanks to the air of urban paranoia and allusions to drug smuggling and prostitution. The only thing that really lets it down is the fact that it relies a bit too heavily on racial stereotyping, but that's easy to forgive when you've got a finale as terrific as this. Lasting over three quarters of an hour, the final bout begins on a packed train, moves to a slaughterhouse where an elite team of specialists take on the Hunter in a frozen abattoir, before Harrigan gives chase to the alien, pursuing him over rooftops, down the the side of buildings and into the dark underbelly of the city. It hasn't got Arnie in it? It doesn't need him.

It's different to the first film yes but it's popularity as a cult classic is undeniable. The film paints it's own unique story instead of thieveing off of and re-treading the first instalment. The Predator itself is given much more of a personality this time, with the kills being more obviously trophies rather than just butchering everything and it is given much more of a background and don't forget, this is the film that gained widespread popularity about the concept of these creatures verses the Aliens with the now infamous 'trophy room scene'.The film races along like most movies of the era, i.e. very good and is possibly one of the last action films to be purely an action film before CGI really started to poke it's nose in about a year later.It would have been interesting to see Schwarzenegger in the film for curiosity's sake, even for a cameo but people just don't seem to see the genius of casting Danny Glover. The film takes the original and flips it on it's head, instead of the South American jungle we get a concrete jungle, and instead of a buffed, super trained commando type we get a middle aged, overweight black cop with street smarts and an attitude which gives the Predator a whole new adversary to try and outsmart.Predator was a great mid 80's defining action film. This sequel is as much a defining action film of it's own era (late 80's, early 90's) as the first one along with Total Recall and Batman and should not be overlooked as a flimsy follow up because it simply isn't. It's a fleshed out expansion of the personality of the predator done stylishly with easily as much character and atmosphere as the original.Get it now!

Yet I personally feel that Predator 2 stands up to scrutiny as a fine entry into the sci-fi/action genre, locating it among the urban decay of L.A. works real well, and pitting the Predator against a tough grizzled (but hardly giganticus beefcakeus) cop (Danny Glover) gives us a smart brains against brawn story. Also cutely is that director Stephen Hopkins and writers Jim & John Thomas, have actually got the Predator cleaning up the streets of L.A., in fact another two hours of Predator hunt and kill tactics and crime in L.A. would have been completely eradicated! There is plenty of bloody snotty gore to appease fans of that persuasion, and it's nice to report that the characters on show do actually impact as part of the story.It has a fine cast that reads like a who's who of action films, Danny Glover (Lethal Weapon), Bill Paxton (Aliens), Robert Davi (Die Hard), Gary Busey (Under Siege), Rubén Blades (Once Upon a Time in Mexico) & Maria Conchita Alonso (The Running Man), whilst Kevin Peter Hall dons the Preadtor suit and suitably kicks arse again.

Out to bag the pernicious intergalactic fiend are loose cannon maverick cop Mike Harrison (a game portrayal by Danny Glover) and arrogant military scientist Keyes (a typically lively performance by the ever-crazed Gary Busey).Although completely predictable and pretty mindless, Predator 2 nonetheless still sizes up as an enjoyably over-the-top sci-fi/action item thanks to Stephen Hopkins' brisk, stylish direction, first-rate make-up f/x by Stan Winston, a stirring score by Alan Silvestri, wall-to-wall in-your-face explosive action set pieces, a breathless frenetic pace, and plenty of excessive graphic splatter.

Predator 2 is one of those rare times. In Predator 2, the acting, story line and action sequences are superior to Predator 1. Predator one was good and introduced us to the Predator. However Arnold's acting was a bit bad however the purpose of the first film was not to garner Arnold Schwarzenegger an Academy Award nomination. Danny Glover is a much better actor. The movie opens up with a scene of a jungle much like the one in Predator one. Then it shows that that jungle is right outside Los Angeles, a concrete jungle.  The second film also gave us a glimpse into the future. The future then was 1997. It showed how drug gangs ruled the cities and acted more like armed political factions than the traditional drug gangs. You have the police who are basically under siege and powerless against these drug gangs. Cops are out gunned and out numbered. Then we throw the Predator in the mix. I found myself cheering for the alien as he killed members of both drug gangs in pretty creative ways. Then comes Danny Glover's character LAPD Lieutenant Mike Harrigan. He's tough as nails and commands a unit of elite cops. The members of his unit are also great actors in their own right. There's Maria Conchita Olanzo, Ruben Blades and a young cocky Bill Paxton. Harrigan is targeted by the alien Predator after the Predator witnesses Harrigans heroic rescue of wounded cops in the opening fire fight. As the movie moves along we find out that as the Predator is hunting the Hispanic drug gang, the Jamacan drug gang and the police, a secret government group is hunting the Predator. The leader of this secret government group is well acted by Gary Busey. Busey and his group want to capture the alien and learn about it's technology. This makes for more people with guns the Alien can hunt. This makes the movie more complex. But it all boils down to the Predators desire to go one on one with Mike Harrigan. Then the Predator gets what he wants however the Predator becomes the prey and Harrigan the hunter. In the end we get a glimpse or the sense of honor the Predators have after Glover kills the Predator. The Predator's buddies actually respect Harrigan and give him a trophy for his kill.    I recommend watching both Predator movies. However if you want a more believable and complex story with better acting. Predator 2 is for you.Rayvyn "},{"Title":"You cannot see the eyes of the demon til he come callin'","Date":"15 October 2011","Score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" From the jungle to the concrete jungle, this is a worthy sequel to the original Predator.

What made that one particularly fun was that for just a little while, it looked like the mighty Arnold might actually lose.Three years later came the unjustly ignored Predator 2, minus Arnold, and that fact alone probably had a lot to do with its lack of box office clout at the time. Despite the lack of star power, Predator 2 stacks up nicely against its predecessor. Rather than simply rehash the first film with a new cast, this high-tech update takes the next logical step with the Predator concept by bringing the alien hunter into the urban jungle.Los Angeles 1997 is not a nice place to visit and you definitely wouldn't want to live there. Not only has an ongoing heat wave pegged the temperature around 110 degrees, but as the film opens we see that clashing gangs of Jamaican and Columbian drug peddlers are regularly waging open warfare in the city streets. Into this mix comes Lieutenant Mike Harrigan (a strong performance by Danny Glover), a tough-as-nails L.A. cop who stumbles into a Predator killing ground during a firefight between gangbangers and police. Harrigan and his team follow the string of grisly murders that follow, despite being warned to keep away by a creepy DEA agent played by the always-welcome Gary Busey. Harrigan and his squad believe at first that they're up against a human enemy, until once of his team members die at the hands (claws?) of the Predator and he finally sees the creature. From there it becomes personal for Harrigan and he wages a one-man war to bring the alien down, eventually leading to a thrilling mano-a-mano fight session aboard the Predator's spaceship, hidden deep below the city.In almost all respects, Predator 2 is a bigger, louder, and more colorful sequel. With a whole city to play in, Predator 2 offers a greater variety of scenery than the jungle setting of the original, which allows for more extensive stunt and action sequences. Glover does a commendable job stepping into Schwarzenegger's shoes, doing a 180 degree turn from the cautious, family-man cop he'd been portraying in the Lethal Weapon films around this time. The rest of Harrigan's team is filled out by Bill Paxton, who's his usual snarky self (as the newest member of the squad), Maria Conchita Alonso and Ruben Blades, both of whom occasionally seem a bit out of their element in an action film (my lone complaint). The appearances by legendary trash-TV host Morton Downey Jr. as a tabloid TV journalist are good for a few chuckles as well. (When I saw this in a theater in 1990, everyone cheered when Glover's character punched him out!) Australian director Stephen Hopkins keeps the explosions and gunfire coming throughout the film so Predator 2 certainly is never boring. It also expands some of the Predator mythology and gives you more of an idea of where they come from and why they're here than the first film did. Predator 2 remains a worthy sequel that deserves a second look, it's far better than you might have heard.

But of course, everyone could've seen this coming, because that's how sequels tend to be like; very, very pale in comparison to the original.This time we have the Predator not in the jungles of Central America, but now in the streets of Los Angeles that has become over-run with a gang war between the Jamaicans and the Columbians. Putting the Predator in the big city wasn't a terrible idea, because where else could you put him besides the jungle? But the thing is, it worked a whole lot better when he was in the jungle, because you could feel the deadly silence and the claustrophobic feel. But in a metropolis like LA, you're just gonna find yourself being distracted, and you can't focus enough on the Predator to be intimidated by it. And also, the film spends over 20 minutes trying to hide the Predator behind its camouflage, question is, why? We've already seen the Predator before and we already know what it looks like, so the movie is basically wasting time trying to keep us guessing.But what really killed this movie for me was Danny Glover. And Predator 2 did nothing for him except prove one fact; Glover can't play the bad@$$/maverick cop. Why? Because that's just not him, he's better off being the good cop who plays by the rules in the Lethal Weapon series. He somewhat acts very awkward when he tries to be the tough guy, but that's just ruined by his stilted mannerisms and his good boy face. An the bottom line is, he's just not very convincing. And what makes it even worse, is that his character Mike Harrigan is totally shallow and not a lot is explained about him. For instance, who is Mike Harrigan? What are his motives for him being a maverick? Did he used to have a family? What were his past experiences like? Movie doesn't say. In the original Predator, we knew who Dutch Schaeffer was, we knew he was an ex-combatant who got involved in too many battles and he's seen a lot of death happen. And that's when he decided to tone himself down and become a rescuer and not an assassin.And also the supporting cast is way outta the league of the one in the first movie. The special forces team members were their own individual characters and we basically wanted to see a spin-off prequel for each of those characters. But in Predator 2, all we get is Bill Paxton being bought in to do what he does best; comic relief. But the jokes that tells are so out-of-place and awkward, and in a few small parts, you can tell that Paxton is just embarrassed to be there in front of the camera and spewing out those crappy lines.Gary Busey's performance is nothing special, and he basically just keeps the same expression throughout the whole way. And the idea of an NSA agent trying to capture an alien isn't even realistic.But one thing I liked about this one is that it revealed new facts about the Predator itself. It reveals that it follows a code and a law and the killings that it commits is just an act of sport. And it only kills those who are armed and it doesn't strike at a pregnant woman so it won't take away any innocent lives.But the action just doesn't interest you and the suspense is pretty much abysmal.

We must remember that he visits Earth (and many other planets) for sport. He is here to prove himself in some ways. He is here for...trophies.This film is very clever. In the first film, the Predator was a new species that we were absolutely terrified of - he was the enemy. We wanted Arnie to win at the end. In this film, our loyalties change from time to time. It all depends on who the alien kills. ** When we see him massacre an entire gang of cocaine snorting villains, we are secretly smiling and wishing them dead, because that's what the police want. But when the 'good guys' get targeted, we despise the Predator. Very clever how it plays on our emotions.Danny Glover puts in a 'Lethal Weapon' style performance as his tough, shoot first ask questions later character Mike Harrigan. He and his team think that there is a vigilante on the loose doing the work for the police, little do they know that there's an alien among them, watching mostly every move they make!** Gary Busey, the moment we see him, we know he's not all he seems, and it turns out that the government and Busey himself know of the Predator's existence. They have been studying him, they know why he comes to Earth to kill, and when. He comes for the thrill of the hunt, and especially when it's a warm climate, and there are constant references to the heat in this film!****** Poor old Bill Paxton - will he ever survive a film!! He dies in 'Aliens' as a hero, and here he also dies bravely. Much humour comes from his character, and it was a shame to lose him, but hey, when the hero needs a good reason to off the villain, let the villain kill someone on the hero's side!! Twice!!Many sequences in this film are directed well. The opening shoot-out. The subway scene. The meat factory scene. All great tension builders.We learn far more about the alien in this film. We are even taken to their spaceship, which is a great work of engineering!The pace of the film is good, only letting up for emotional reasons, and the blood and explosions just keep on coming! The first films are always the best (apart from a select few sequels - Godfather 2, Aliens) but this doesn't fail to impress, it is a worthy sequel, and one that seems to have been carefully planned.There has been much speculation of a 3rd installment to the series, but if it's anything like the Alien Legacy, better leave it there really. Much talk surrounds the possible Alien Vs. Predator film - now that is one I would really like to see!!!But this is still worth 8/10. An enjoyable film, which makes you think a little bit more than the original. See it if you liked the first!

There were a lot of negative response regarding this picture when it came out. After watching this movie for 7-10 times in my life (seriously) I simply can not understand, why was this negative reaction. These are the reasons why in my opinion Predator 2 is superb entertainment, based on negative stuff that I have read1) The setting. It's a sequel, so if it would be set in jungle again, it would repeat itself. Predator 2 takes place in urban setting, so it's 360° different than the first picture. The city itself is not overdone in futuristic style, it's 1997 (future at the time when movie was made) and crime chaos is on the streets of L.A.2)No Arnie. Really? Is that an issue? How realist is would be if out of nowhere, the same person would encounter the creature from outer space on second time. Yes, there are legendary examples like Alien franchise (only first two pictures), but I don't think I would have worked equally good in this franchise. The new setting &#x96; logical that it has a new lead.3)D.Glover is not an action hero. Not true! He's superbly cast here as a lead hero. In this setting, he's a cool, mortal detective who gets in very unusual situation and acts as our everyday hero. He's not Arnie, and he shouldn't be &#x96; it would be more funny if they would have cast D.Lundgren type actor as a synonym to Arnie.These are pretty much the main issues that audiences / critics have got upon it's release.Overall, Predator 2 is superb entertainment, superb sequel - you can't ask for more. "},{"Title":"A creditable sequel, bringing together some favourite genres","Date":"2 September 2013","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" The original Predator (1987) is a highly regarded classic '80s action flick with a sci-fi twist, and Predator 2 is a worthy sequel, expanding the Predator myth, throwing the titular antagonist into a new setting and delivering another slick action thriller. The backdrop is the urban jungle, dystopian future Los Angeles circa 1997, where the high crime rates of the early '90s have given way to open gang warfare, with the overstretched police department struggling to keep control. The city is suffering from the worst heat wave on record, another facet to the dystopia possibly projected from fears of climate change. Apparently, the Predator is drawn to heat and conflict and has come on safari.The lack of leading man Arnold Schwarzenegger, as well as many other elements from the first film is something of a risk, but this allows Predator 2 to avoid becoming a tacked-on sequel; it is instead very much a standalone film. The only returning cast member is the 7'2 Kevin Peter Hall portraying the titular Predator. The new star is Danny Glover, fresh from Lethal Weapon fame, as maverick cop Lieutenant Mike Harrigan.Worn down by the attrition of a demanding environment, Glover's character is a tough, but aging man, in contrast to the one-liner spouting, superhuman Schwarzenegger. Of course, this is why we loved Schwarzenegger, and why he is the perfect choice to go head to head with such a savage alien beast. Nevertheless, Lieutenant Harrigan provides a different kind of grizzled humanity. Unlike Schwarzenegger's former Green Beret, Harrigan is a cop, not a soldier. He is a man who knows what he needs to do, and the conviction to persevere against all the odds, even if he is starting to become slightly less confident in his own abilities.For a film that takes the saga in so many different directions, Predator 2 remains faithful to the series with plenty of parallels and call- backs. In both the first two Predator films, Our human hero goes on the hunt with a team of close friends and allies; before long, they become the hunted and are picked off as the film continues, leaving the last man alone to survive a few rounds with the Predator in a battle of wits and strength. The technology is consistent the Predator comes packing his three-dot scope laser, infrared vision and explosive countdown timer. But he also showcases his medical kit and trophy cleaning equipment (a lot more grotesque than it sounds when said trophy is a victim's skull).The Predator is once more instilled with the alien sense of honour seen in the last film. The hunting tactics are expanded, we watch in horror as the Predator collects trophies the cleansed skulls of his prey, and notice as he seeks out and values the challenge of a leader (from drug kingpin King Willie, to Harrigan himself). While brutal, he refrains from harming the unarmed or the vulnerable, including the pregnant detective Leona.The first part of the film plays out like a classic cop movie, albeit one with a dystopian flair, and higher stakes from the start. After an intense opening shootout, Harrigan enters the building where a gang are holed up, only to find their targets have been ritualistically slaughtered. Before long, Harrigan and his team are investigating a series of similarly brutal gangland killings, but are thwarted at every turn. Much to Harrigan's chagrin, an FBI team led by Special Agent Keyes (Gary Busey) begins to muscle in on his jurisdiction and stop him working the case. Clearly, not everything is what it seems. Busey's performance is typically eccentric, frequently garnished with generous helpings of ham as he quotes from the Wizard of Oz, once Harrigan's persistence wins through and Keyes starts spilling the beans. A new director takes the reins for this sequel. John McTiernan, who went on to direct Die Hard (1988) was replaced by the relatively unknown Stephen Hopkins. He relies perhaps on a tried and tested action-movie style, but a lot of thought is given to the pacing, which is intense, and barely lets up throughout. In fact, once the Predator's decimation of the FBI task force ups the ante, the remaining screen time is devoted to Harrigan's pursuit and combat with the Predator. Yet despite this, it is not exhausting in its intensity, and remains entertaining.Effective use is made of point of view shots, as the Predator watches his prey from various vantage points above the action. We can be sure it is him, and not just misdirection by the use of the infrared scope he uses to see. The Predator is then unseen as shots swoop around the urban rooftops. Often, all we see is the shimmering haze of the Predator's camouflage device, which is frequently misidentified as just another hazy shimmer in the sweltering Los Angeles heat wave &#x96; until, of course, it is too late. A suitably disorienting strobe effect is used in a memorable scene on the subway, when a whole host of armed thugs and civilians become easy pickings for the beast.Much of the film is not so subtle, the cops are rebels, the gang members are stereotypical, and the language through back and forth in anger and desperation is frequently crude. There is relentless wall to wall violence that could be deemed excessive by the faint hearted, but I think this is par for the course in any film that tries to do justice to an alien warrior who hunts humans for his sport. We are again left with the sense that any victory against such a Predator is little more than Pyrrhic.It's hard not to enjoy Predator 2. A creditable sequel, it brings together some favourite genres, from the procedural police story, through the mystery of an unseen killer, to the science fiction of the hunter from another world, into a solidly entertaining action film.

Things take a bizarre turn when an unknown force begins to take out all sides and soon Harrigan finds out that he's dealing with something from another world. PREDATOR 2 is actually a better film than the first one because of how sleazy it is. I remember watching this in the theater when it was first released and I still recall how many people walked about because of how violent the film is. Watching the movie for the first time in over twenty-years I was surprised to see that it actually holds up quite well in regards to the action but also just how shocking it is that something this dirty wasn't completely cut up by the MPAA. I thought the story here wasn't all that strong as there are many questions left unanswered but this here really doesn't take away from the good time. The film pretty much starts off in high gear and throughout the running time we've always got some sort of action going on. The opening shoot out between the police and the drug dealers was extremely exciting and of course things heat up on the predator is thrown into the action. I really thought the film offered up a very sleazy side including some nudity, a somewhat rough sex scene, non-stop profanity and then there's the violence. Considering how badly horror films were getting chopped by the MPAA it's rather shocking to see how much blood and guts were allowed to stay in the movie. I'd say there's enough here to turn away weaker viewers but those who can handle the stuff will be entertained with the great special effects. The look of the predator this time around is quite good and I really thought having him in a city worked even if they didn't exploit it as much as one would have liked. Glover is good in the lead role and we also get some nice work from Gary Busey, Bill Paxton, Ruben Blades and Robert Davi. The one issue I had with the film is that it starts to run out of gas by the time the ending comes and once it does, I think it's the weakest thing here.

You can't jump start a story with a creature like Predator and now want to explore everything there is about him and rightfully so. However, there were some serious mis-steps in the making of this sequel and casting was definitely part of it. The fact that Schwarzenegger did not return having decided (rightfully so) to do T2 was a huge misfortune for the film makers. Furthermore choosing Danny Glover as their star was simply a big mistake. I like Glover but he's a supporting/character/sidekick actor not a star that can carry the film. Taking the Predator out of the jungle was interesting but ultimately a bad decision. There was something instinctual and animalistic about Predator hunting in the jungle and it just seems awkward and forced in the city landscape. The most important thing about Predator 2 is the details they put into learning more about what and who the Predator is. We see their ship, more into their arsenal and their vision capabilities. Predator 2 feels like it leans more into the horror genre than the action and while the Predator focus is good it loses a lot of points in style, plot and action.I don't want to harp anymore on Danny Glover but his role in this was ludicrous. Schwarzenegger was so good because it was completely believe that this war bred soldier could fight with everything he had against this larger than life being from another world. Glover does the same and in fact seems to give the Predator an even bigger battle than Schwarzenegger did without pushing himself as much and that just seems ludicrous. He was the wrong choice for this film. Gary Busey is decent as the Predator obsessed Peter Keyes. He doesn't get a lot of scenes but he does well in them, just a tad cheesy at times which is typical Busey. Kevin Peter Hall returns as The Predator and he deserves mention because his massive hulking presence and his body language speaks volumes and makes you believe this being from another planet. Supporting cast including a very young Bill Paxton, Maria Conchita Alonso and Adam Baldwin in decent but small mostly insignificant roles. Paxton is fun but brief without a lot of depth to his character. I almost would have bought him as the hero before Glover.Another strike against Predator 2 was the loss of the amazing John McTiernan for Stephen Hopkins. Nothing against the guy because he's done some good TV later on and a (meaning one) decent movie, The Ghost and The Darkness but he didn't have the same level of commitment or experience needed to do this one justice. As I mentioned, its not a complete loss. There are some solid scenes, some decent action and the last scene on the spacecraft is impressive to Predator fans. I really felt like the biggest issue was Glover in the starring role. He doesn't carry the film that way it needs to be. Obviously you can't experience Predator without seeing this film but it certainly is a bit of a let down once you've watched the first one. Its a little less cheesy than the first but lacks that certain classic feel. 6.5/10 "},{"Title":"Voodoo magic.

Director Stephen Hopkins, that should give you your first indication of how different this film is from its predecessor. Unlike McTiernan, the no-nonsense, straightforward action director who directed the first installment, Hopkins is famed for less straightforward films, such as The Life and Death of Peter Sellers. The first few minutes of the film willserve to solidify the fact that this film is entirely different from its predecessor, with the exception of the title character. Aside from Kevin Peter Hall, who returns to play the Predator, the cast is entirely different from that of the original.This film is set in 1997 in L.A. where rival gangs have turned the streets into a war zone and where the Predator is loose and off killing/skinning people... But the story doesn't really matter. The good news about this film is that this L.A. feels more like Gotham city than the real Los Angeles, and the comic book atmosphere really does work here. All the characters are overblown and cartoonish and the cast is fun to watch, especially Glover and Paxton. However, the film's quality is diminished by a very uneven script, a pretty bad score, and some questionable directorial choices. But it's still an enjoyable action romp and the Predator itself is a bit more interesting here in terms of its movement and weaponry. Predator 2 is one of the few sequels that truly separates itself from its predecessor. However, in going for the atmosphere it goes for, Predator 2 earns comparison to those films that are similar to it, and in that sense is merely a pleasant, good film. Compared to the original it lacks the suspense or excitement of its predecessor. This is a good film, but maybe it should be forgotten as part of the Predator franchise, as it negates Predator's fearsome nature by replacing it with cartoonish violence and broad characterizations. 6/10 "},{"Title":"The urban jungle is his home now!","Date":"14 February 2007","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" My Take Actually equal to the original in most ways. A thrilling guilty pleasure all the way. I loved the original Predator, but I was quite surprised to see that I liked the sequel lives up, and sometimes even outdoes it. The original drags just quite a bit, the whole commando plot. This sequel has cops against drug dealers, but doesn't wade in the subplot for too long, like the original, making it more fast-paced. Danny Glover may not be quite as effective as Arny was in the original, but he manages to get the job done well. The special-effects and Stan Winston's new Predator adds to the greatness. Although much of the gripping tension of the first film is repeated, it's still so excellent in bringing about some new thrills all its own. The film takes place in the future (1997). Drug dealers have turned the local L.A. streets in to a war zone and only the rough-and-tough L.A. cops to stop them, but can they stop the alien Predator? Well, finding out will be such a viewing treat. Stephen Hopkins may not be a director worth winning an Oscar, but he does his job well. Alan Silvestri's music has improved a little from the first film. Though it gets some bad criticism, PREDATOR 2 is an adequate follow-up to the first film, providing a more suitable hunting ground for its monster. It's entertaining in the it's-a-sequel sort of way.

As many of you probably know already, Predator 2 was the highly anticipated sequel to the 1987 hit and upon its release has inspired countless hours of debate over the years as to whether it's great or dreck. It should probably go without saying that I myself consider it to be an excellent sci-fi/horror picture infused with a certain urban grittiness and the dark underbelly of metropolitan America. Set in the mean streets of Los Angeles in the year 1997, the story revolves around a viscous drug war that has grown out of control for most of the cops. Most of the cops that is, except for a handful of detectives led by LT. Mike Harrigan (played by Danny Glover with the same tenacity that he showed in Lethal Weapon), a tough as nails street warrior who does whatever it takes to get the job done. However, it soon becomes apparent that not all of the killing is being done by humans as a mysterious team of govt. agents come to town led by Peter Keyes (played by Gary Busey with his typical crazy zeal) and the fact that the physical evidence just isn't making much sense. It doesn't take long to figure out that he's back; that alien with a face that only mom could love! The first thing that makes the movie as good as it is would be the setting of Los Angeles. If you think about it, moving the setting from the jungle to the big city was very risky and despite what the detractors say, it works. It brings the grittiness that one sees all too often in the urban jungles into the mix which helps create a sort of crime thriller/slasher story for the characters, thus making the story more intriguing even though we already know what the killer is. The second thing that adds to the movie is Danny Glover's performance of Harrigan. Some might say that Glover was miscast in the movie, that he can't do action movies like Stallone or Schwarzenegger. Well, to those I ask what category would you consider the Lethal Weapon movies to fall under? Romance? Oscar? Shakespearean drama? Of course not! And although Glover is once more playing a cop, he does a good job distinguishing Harrigan from Dect. Murtaugh in the Weapon films. Murtaugh if you recall, was always the reserved one, the one who didn't want to do anything crazy but always ended up doing so because of his partner Briggs. Harrigan on the other hand, just doesn't give a sh**. Except when it comes to heights, that is. Finally, there is the predator itself, played once more by the late great Kevin Peter Hall. Although he is covered in makeup from head to toe, Hall gives the predator every bit of a unique personality and attitude that many actors probably couldn't if they were in a similar situation. The writers also give the predators new weapons such as the retractable staff and a flying frisbee of death. Plus, there's a little bit more teeth on the predator's makeup this time around which only adds to its awesomeness. The movie also stars Bill Paxton with his usual bigger than life persona, the beautiful Maria Conchita Alonso, the supportive Ruben Blades, the always memorable Robert Davi, and in a well done performance of a particularly slimy TV reporter, the late Morton Downey Jr. To sum it up, don't listen to the detractors; watch the movie yourself and see a time when Hollywood still took risks with great results.

While the first film was indeed a masterpiece, I think this one just clinches it, apart from anything else, because of the variety of funky weapons this Predator uses.  It makes the action scenes much more interesting to watch, as he continually pulls out different weapons for each of his prey. Also, Kevin Peter Hall puts across a surprisingly deep performance for such a violent creature.  All too often, monster bad-guys are all Grr, Argh and show very little intelligence, but this boy is smart. Of course, this movie inconspicuously links to that other great Sci-fi saga, the 'Alien' films, by showing the skull of an Alien drone in the Predator's trophy room.  It's only glimpsed twice in the movie, but provides the only on-screen basis for the 'Aliens vs. Predator' franchise. Hopefully, Fox might get its act together and finally give us an AvP movie...

Plot points in the original suggest that the Predator is from a more advanced culture than ours..not only technologically, but also their games. He's on holiday, hunting  for trophies, using a Bushido-like code of honor.A lot of this backstory was covered well in some very successful graphic novels. They served to amuse the faithful, but failed to bring the rest of us up to speed. This leaves too much detail hidden from the audience as Danny Glover tries to piece together what he's up against (and makes his conclusions harder to reach).It appears that the director has seen those helpful expositions, or he was able to infer them from the original movie. Either way, the action is too diffcult to follow the first time around unless you know the Predator already. Once you see the ending, you have enough info to go back and enjoy the film the next time.The movie is true to the source material, but not true to the audience.

As people have said, there is more Predator time on screen, the action sequences are exciting, new weapons, all these things really add to this being a great movie. But for me, I find there is one main element which made this film on a par with the original, and some may say, even better.What was executed perfectly, in order to differentiate it from the first, is the mood of the piece. This is one eerie, complex, and at times downright terrifying film. The way Los Angeles was painted for this, as the platform for the story to go to work, is simply ingenious. The entire movie works to represent a city in the depths of despair. There are a few key scenes I would like to touch on here.Firstly, the film immediately starts by placing the viewer in the near future (well 1997 was the near future when the film was released), in a very bleak Los Angeles, which is boiling over in a cesspit of crime. Street warfare is taking place on a mammoth scale, between the authorities and drug gangs. The sheer ferocity of the warfare to open the film, can't help but make a viewer engage and feel uneasy about this city. Adding to this is the aggressive nature at which the drug gang goes to work. Restocking their weapons, encouraging each other, snorting drugs mid fire fight, there is no fear of consequence, a frightful thing to witness. Then insert a Predator into story, and make an already horrific scene worse, leaving behind an unexplainable bloodbath.Secondly, the police station scene also works very well to set the mood. No violence or warfare, but just a police station jammed to the walls with criminals, needing to be processed. It is here that our main character (Lieutenant Mike Harrigan) explains the drug war, to a new recruit. I really like the scripting in this scene, and throughout the movie. The dialogue is clever, and paints a vivid picture of the situation, with no gloss or wasted words, just descriptions spoken with exceptional potency. A hidden gem in this scene also helping to set the mood is the sweat. Everyone is sweating profusely from a heat wave, and the dust in the air is lit by intrusive beaming rays of sun through the filthy office windows. It all works so well to present a city and a police force nearing breaking point.Thirdly, for vicious intensity, I cannot go past the action scene on the subway train. The opening shot of a subway train thundering past, immediately feels intimidating. Add in a sweaty crowded train, more criminals, and our main villain, and we have a showdown in a tight space whilst in motion. This for me is probably the creepiest scene from the whole Predator franchise. And although so many elements are mixed together to make it special, the lighting takes all honours. The use of strobe lighting effects, and gun muzzle flashes, make this edge of your seat viewing. This is horror at the highest level, played out to perfection, in an action film.There are so many parts of this film that work to set and complement the mood of the piece. From the scenes mentioned, to the drug gangs voodoo magic rituals, a back alley meeting with a drug lord, and also the sickening and deplorable media coverage of Hard Copy. So many filmic aspects, from the dynamic and contrasting characters (without the macho) and the richness they bring to a dire situation, a score that is decisively injected throughout, and the lighting of the night to perfection. This truly is a great sequel, and don't get me wrong, the Predator steals the show once again. But I believe the silent achiever was the portrayal of a city with little to no hope left, which really is the all important catalyst to making this an original and highly entertaining film.

Predator 2 was one of them. Was.What starts off with a good concept, bringing the Predator from Jungle Predator to the city, it solely falls flat. Unfortunately, two other examples fit this same mold (Friday the 13th Part VIII Jason Takes Manhattan and The Lost World Jurassic Park) and both had the same crummy result.The difference here is, I'm a huge Jason Voorhees fan &#x96; but his (so-called) Manhattan scenes don't happen until about 10 minutes until the movie ends. Same with Jurassic Park; the dinos journey to San Diego, just in time to see the finale of the already-too-long film. I'm not so much a Predator fan, though the concept of bringing him to an industrial jungle of sorts intrigued me. On paper, it's cool, but it's the execution that's lacking&#x85;anything good.And, ironically, what I hated from the first film &#x96; the lack of a solid plot, was the thing I really hated about this sequel too much plot. We have voodoo gang members, a rogue cop, a visiting Predator, instant Global warming, the future world of crime, a secret government agency and a miniature history into the Predator's existence. This movie was all over the place and wanted to cram too much in, when it would've been just fine with the simple concept of Predator taking a wrong turn in Albuquerque and ending in L.A.Also, what gives with both a Robocop theme &#x96; probably not coincidentally, the other Sci-Fi Future Part II, Robocop 2, came out a few months before this one. Or the exact duplicate scenes stolen from Aliens? It's no wonder the Aliens would battle the Predators soon enough. Heck, even Before-He-Matured Bill Paxton was in both Aliens and Predator 2. (See a MUCH better side of Mr. Paxton in Frailty and A Simple Plan. Shoot, he was better in Twister and his The Terminator extras scene.)While I barely want to comment on the addition of Morton Downey, Jr. &#x96; God, he was a horrible personality in TV and he's not much better here, I will have to mention poor, poor Danny Glover. Sure, no one can replace Arnold Schwarzenegger &#x96; NO ONE &#x96; and I'm sure that wasn't their 100% intentions, but come on. Glover did the best he could with the role, but only played a more serious version of his Lethal Weapon character Sergeant Roger Murtaugh. Granted, outside of the Lethal Weapon franchise, Grand Canyon and the original Saw, he hasn't been in the best movies. (No, I have yet to see The Color Purple &#x96; I can't reference to which I have not seen.)The movie takes place in the far-distant future of 1997 (7 years from when the actual movie took place) in Los Angeles. It's 109 degrees and it's crime filled with a Voodoo Cocaine Gang that holds both Lieutenant Harrigan (Glover) and the Predator's (Hall) interest. Technically, the invisible hunter Predator is helping the police, and World, as a whole, but tracking down and slaughtering the gang members, but this doesn't stop Harrigan from investigating and getting his partners killed in the process.Eventually he meets up with 1980's icon (yeah, I know this was released in 1990, but his career wasn't quite over yet) Gary Busey who plays super-secret agent out to trap and harvest the Predator for the military. Sound familiar? Anyways, along with goofy, and completely unfunny sidekick, Jerry (Paxton) they get deeper in the web of the Predator's plans for, well, hunting.The movie ends cleverly &#x96; and I won't spoil it, this is one of the movie's highlights. Okay, I'll give a clue they'll eventually produce a similar scene in Bride of Chucky's opening scene.All the key players from the 1980's/1990's action films are here as are the clichéd scenes, but the movie has zero heart and the potential for a unique sequel was squandered. And that scene where the soldiers are about to be ambushed and Harrigan tries to get their superiors to get them out of harm's way while watching from monitors&#x85;p#ssed me off. It's one thing to mimic a movie, but to blatantly steal from the superior Aliens is just plain bad taste.

More Predator weapons are seen, you get to see the inside of a Predator ship, including a trophy room.

Having recently watched it however, I think it's a great action movie.  It's not really set in reality, more of a near-future setting, so they can get away with the crime ridden city and packed police stations.  It's almost a comic book setting, but gritty enough to work in live video.  The director gave the movie a great claustrophobic feel. This movie has more action, more Predator, more Predator weapons, less characters that aren't a whole lot more than muscles, not that those kinds of characters can't be fun either.. and I think it's a lot of fun, and doesn't even get too out there.  The slaughterhouse scene could be very debatable with the silver suits and liquid nitrogen guns, but it made sense in the context they were using them, and I think those suits even look somewhat like the Predator's own suit, with the shoulder mounted devices and all.  Those suits were human technology to avoid detection by the Predator, the Predator's suit is technology to be stealthy against the humans.If you don't like a cool alien killing all kinds of people, shootouts, gritty city settings, and excess blood and explosions, what are you watching an action movie for in the first place?

The first one was brilliant with its claustrophobic atmosphere and interesting characters that were very cool and made us feel a slight pang of loss as they got dispatched by the Predator.  The atmosphere was one of the key elements in the first movie, and it also gave Arnie a real challenge for a change (Whose blood didn't get pumping when Arnie pulled his 'Heart of Darkness' boyscout tricks in a all out fight with the Predator?).With all of that said, I'd like to say that I really like this movie.  Though there are some kinks in it as well as some bad dialogue, it is overall a pretty exciting movie.  I think it's safe to say that there is quite a bit more bloodshed this time around, which is good and bad.  It is good b\c the action scenes are, simply put, awesome.  The war between the cops, the drug dealers and the Predator is always no-holds-barred, and though some of it is definitely Hollywood (I didn't know drug dealers had access to military weaponry?) there are a lot of realistic and also daring scenes (the subway shootout is definitely one of them).  The bad part of the excessive action is that there really isn't as much tension in the stalking process this time around.  Though, the first time I saw this, I was 10 years old and excitedly scared out of my wits by this film (and who wouldn't be?  The Predator is one of the most horrific killers ever to grace the silver screen), it doesn't quite have the build up when Arnie and his troops were being stalked in the jungle.  However, there are still quite a few tense moments as well as good scares in this film especially since the Predator is one frightening looking SOB!The best part that I loved about this movie was the way they portrayed the Predator.  When I was a kid, I just saw him as a mindless killing machine, but this now, after watching it recently, I saw how they portrayed him with an ethical code of honor with whom he kills and how (noone that he considers a real threat).  I notice his favorite method is to methodically kill everyone in a group, by any means necessary and then spare the bravest or toughest opponent for a one-on-one battle.  I think it was genious how the creature stalked Harrigan after witnessing his heroics in the beginning and how the movie never blatantly pointed it out (via someone to explain it all to the audience).  Definitely an interesting idea, which is rare for a sequel. The acting is pretty good, overall.  Danny Glover did a good job with his role as Harrigan as well as Bill Paxton (who, by the way, has one of the coolest pre-death scenes ever).  The dialogue lacks in some areas, but is made up with the solid directing and pulse pounding score by Alan Silvestri.  The script could have used some fine tuning, but the action never lets up and the movie, as a whole, is paced very well.  All in all, this is a worthy sequel to one of Arnie's best.  I don't understand why so many people on this board put up negative reviews for this movie, despite the flaws mentioned above.  I think the filmmakers put a little more thought into the average action film and it shows.

It has story problems, casting problems, and originality problems. The novelty of the Predator has worn out in this film, and the whole thing was a bore from start to finish. It's no wonder that this movie isn't brought up much when discussing the Predator franchise; it's overwhelmingly forgettable.So this time around, the locale has changed from a dense Mexican jungle to the city of Los Angeles. While this film could be admired for risking such a style change, the effect is unoriginal and very out-of- place. It takes away from the Predator's primal mystique. Also, for whatever reason, the script introduces an entirely new cast of characters, without a single returning actor and scarcely a mention of Arnold's original team. Again, this is not a bad change in and of itself, but here it only leads to a rehash of familiar plot devices. The audience already knows that the mystery killer is an alien hunter, but they still have to spend over an hour watching the main characters figure it out. Where's the fun, or the suspense, in that?The same can be asked of the Predator itself. At this point we've seen what the Predator can do, and this movie doesn't offer any new tricks. It looks the same, acts the same, and shamelessly rips itself off by copying the heat-vision POV (which is utilized randomly and pointlessly here), as well as the mask removal scene. They even reuse the 'ugly motherf@#$er' line. The movie would have been better served if the antagonist was a new variant of the Predator with some new tricks up its sleeve, à la the 2010 sequel Predators.Like the first film, Predator 2 has some character issues. Replacing the always enjoyable Arnold Schwarzenegger is Danny Glover, who makes a horrendous protagonist. He is constantly angry, overly violent, and completely unlikeable, and is just not believable as an action hero. The rest of the underdeveloped cast is just as bad, relying either on forced exposition to describe characters or painfully obvious archetype clichés to develop them. We hear about how much of a hero Glover's character is even though this is never demonstrated, and about his longtime friendship with his police partner, though this is never proved in their interactions. At one point, a female cop grabs a flirting Bill Paxton by the family jewels and threatens him to leave her alone. Okay, we get it; she's a strong and independent woman who doesn't take crap from anyone. There were many better ways to show it. Ultimately, you won't remember any of these characters ten minutes after you finish the movie.Put all these factors together and you get a severe lack of entertainment. While the first film was riveting and intense, this one is just an unremarkable bore. The story was lame and unwanted, the Predator itself is now derivative, and the characters are pathetic. The best thing about it was the musical score, and of course it was ripped straight from the original. The most interesting thing this movie had to offer was the possibility of a crossover with another classic sci-fi monster (and we all know how that eventually turned out). Don't waste your time with the lackluster Predator 2. I give it 2 out of 10 stars.

In 1990, PREDATOR 2 hit the movie screen to lackluster response. As with most sequels, it failed to capture, or duplicate convincingly, what had made the first film so popular. The first PREDATOR was a violent, well produced action film starring Arnold Schwarzenegger as the leader of a band of army commandos who are hunted by an alien creature in a South American jungle. The film remains a holdover from my formative adolescent years and I have come to appreciate it as a tight, suspenseful action thriller with inspired makeup design by Stan Winston. Well, in the sequel (as the tagline would suggest), the scene has changed from the actual jungle to the urban jungle of L.A. Where, during a heatwave, the city is beset upon by another malevolent visitor from beyond the stars. The hero this time is the tough L.A. cop (is there any other kind?) Mike Harrigan (Danny Glover). He is surrounded by mainly disposable characters who are designed to be threatened or avenged Danny Archuleta (Ruben Blades), Leona Cantrell (Maria Conchita Alonso), Jerry Lambert (Bill Paxton, still in his screeching whine period; see also ALIENS), as well as various captains (Kent McCord, Robert Davi) who repeatedly tell Harrigan he is a loose cannon or that he is officially off the case, etc. There is also a subplot involving a gang war between the Colombians and the Jamaicans, the turmoil being covered by a tabloid journalist (Morton Downey Jr. !) who adds bits of editorial insight into the various happenings. Adding to the cluttered attic that is the plot of PREDATOR 2 is a group of military researchers, lead by Peter Keyes (Gary Busey), who are out to capture and study the Predator; it is through them that Harrigan gains a more formative knowledge of what he is dealing with.PREDATOR 2 is one of of those sequels that fleshes out the mythology of an enigmatic concept. We get insight on what the creature eats, various medical gadgets it uses, a brief glimpse at a trophy case, and lengthy conversations on numerous behavioral patterns. In PREDATOR 2, we learn, for example, the actual physics of the creature's cloaking device, which is great trivia, but much of the mystery is explained away. The result of all these explanations is that the Predator becomes mundane, a bit of a bore. In the preceding film, many of these questions are left unanswered or implied, focusing on the tension and isolation of the events. Gone also is the juxtaposition of the original storyline the soldiers are professional killers who encounter something that is even more dangerous than themselves. They are not heroic in any real sense, but highly skilled men on which the tables have been turned. In PREDATOR 2 we get the more straightforward good cop versus the evil alien scenario which is not as satisfying. Black and white is not as interesting, to me anyway, as the varied shades of gray that the original film created.The fact that PREDATOR 2 has many well produced action sequences, but very little character development, should come as no surprise considering that it is directed by Stephen Hopkins (LOST IN SPACE, JUDGMENT NIGHT, BLOWN AWAY, THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS). The first PREDATOR did not exactly have the most dynamic characters, but John McTiernan, and his actors, did much with narrative shorthand in creating a functional situation in which the viewer was, at least, concerned about the ultimate outcome of the commando's plight. In the sequel, however, the cast is mainly B-list, and those who aren't are wasted. Danny Glover steps into the lead role, but seems out of place as an action film tough guy (his character in the LETHAL WEAPON series, the closest comparison, had much more nuance). I would guess he was cast to lend some credibility to what is, in essence, an attempt to produce the same financial return as the original. It would also seem that the filmmakers expected a veteran actor like Glover to carry much of the human drama of PREDATOR 2 without much help from the supporting cast. Not to be overly critical here, the film does have some good points Hopkins has a flare for explosions (forgive the pun) and gunfights and PREDATOR 2 is fun to watch for those reasons. Alan Silvestri returns as composer, adding layers of aggressive rhythm to his themes from the first film. The film looks good and the production design, particularly the interior of the Predator's ship, is impressive. I can't really say that I like PREDATOR 2, but it has enough action and goofy sequences (the scene in the subway were every passenger carries a gun for example) to make it a mildly entertaining guilty pleasure. 4/10 "},{"Title":"He's in town...with a few days to kill...","Date":"2 May 2016","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" Following a wildly successful film is never easy, especially one backed up with the star power of an Arnold Schwarzenegger, who apparently chose not to reprise his role as he didn't care for the script, feeling the idea of a Predator film set in a major metropolitan city was a poor one. The best thing about the Predator is that he is more detail now. He looks a lot better than he did in the first movie, and the movement is much more tribal, all praise goes to Kevin who studied African tribes so he could master being the Predator, and it really shows in this film. The Predator's weapons are fantastic. You really do get to see the Predator's arsenal in this film.Glover and director Hopkins do a good job, but the effect is kind of like going from tender, juicy steak to a hamburger. The impression I got of the species is that their whole lifestyle, be that as it may, seems to revolve around the hunt, and the more difficult the prey, most likely the greater the prestige and status. If that's the case, why do they visit the Earth, specifically to hunt humans? Let's face it, we're pretty easy targets, given their technology, weapons, and various other strengths. Sure, once in awhile they may come across a worthy opponent, like Schwarzenegger's character in the previous film, or Glover here, but in general, they mop the floor with us. However, this movie never garnered the attention that its predecessor did. This is likely due to the fact that we all wanted a Schwarzenegger shoot-em-up and got a slightly more humorous, plot-driven Predator featuring more of an everyman type of hero.Overall rating 7 out of 10.

The case becomes personal, when one of his team is killed by the notorious SOB. Glover leads a real likable, of course, Paxton, as a new eager beaver cop to their group, again steals the spotlight, where the performances by these players are quite impressive, as again watching the beautifully agile predator do his stuff is breathtaking up close. I really did like Maria Conchita Alonso's performance in this too, (another Where is she now? question) Not making Glover's job any easier, is a special FBI team, led by Busey (top form) who provide the answer to Glover's dismayed and frustrated team. The one on one fight with Glover and beast, is very drawn out too, but also unveils a more deadlier surprise, where we end up with what you could say, is a unpredictable resolution, like a long third act, where at the end of the film, like Glover, we are beat, and the L.A heat really works well for this atmosphere of chaos. Quite a smart, and well made sequel, more grizzly than the first, let me tell ya. Great poster design.

I agree that the acting is somewhat wooden at places, BUT, and it is a big BUT; the overall feel of the movie is quite simply awesome. The action scenes are more than awesome. The expansion of the universe quite brilliant.There are so many memorable and quite iconic scenes in Predator 2, that still look amazing by todays standards (2016). The killing of King Willie, the train scene, the butchering of the drug lord by the Jamaicans, the slaughter house, the final mano e beast scene, the revelation right at the end and most importantly the excellent expansion of the universe. Extremely well done.Compared with Predator movies coming since 1990 the Predator in this one still feels invincible. Like a true force of nature. Not like the dumb ass, clumpsy predators in the extremely bad Predators.Unfortunately the guy in the suit, Kevin Peter Hall, is no longer with us. His other worldly moves inside the Predator latex simply can't be replicated, as evidenced by the extremely heavy handed Predators in the Predators movie.Two thumbs up! Great movie! Give it a shot! I actually think it is better than the first one. "},{"Title":"Odd sequel","Date":"20 February 2016","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" I loved this film. It's really, really bad, but easily one of the funniest films I've seen recently. For some strange reason it's set a mere seven years into the future from 1990, 1997, during a heat wave and gang war in LA. The fact that it's in the future doesn't add much to the story, but I guess the cars look a little different. And the guns. Danny Glover is wound up in the most ridiculous way and for no justifiable reason. One minute he climbs out of a gangster's limo in a cloud of smoke and tells them to lay of the ganj as he goes to see a mystic informant, and the next he's rushing around mad and wound up for no reason like a raging paranoiac with a fear of heights and no time to masturbate who curses birds. Bill Paxton is also ridiulous as his short-lived up and coming partner. The funniest scene in the film has him try to get in the hotboxed limo that takes Glover to the informant, before running after it and shouting f--k! as it drives off. I don't know, I guess he really wanted to get stoned. It's a weird film, and does not make much sense. Danny Glover's character has an intense fear of heights that means the finale of the film is a little longer than usual. I guess it serves to give him a disadvantage to the predator but they don't use it. Instead he climbs out down a ledge and curses about how he doesn't need birds, then finds himself in a spaceship. The characters are all ridiculous, especially Glover's character, who shouts at everything and runs around talking to himself. In one scene he rushes after Gary Busey's equally frustrated agent and grabs him by the collar, but while other films would have him approach casually like a bad ass, or meet him in a corridor, this film has him run out of his office and run down stairs, barging past people, despite the fact that Busey is walking slowly away. It just looks silly and I'm sure it's intentional, because there are many other things that make no sense. In one scene Paxton and Glover are both wearing suits and trilbies, despite having never worn them before, and they never wear them again. It's just slightly bewildering, and kudos to the film makers if it was intentional, because it works without being obvious or self conscious.I don't know, I'll definitely be watching this again, but although unique it's not as good an action film as the first Predator.

It is a hot summer and the predator has been drawn to the war between rival drug-gangs which the police are struggling to deal with. Glover plays Lieutenant Mike Harrigan; a tough cop who realises that something strange is going on; a group of heavily armed gangsters are wiped out by something that doesn't appear to have been armed. He is determined to get to the bottom of it but is ordered to stay away when federal agent Peter Keyes appears on the scene. Inevitably the predator strikes again and it isn't long before one of Harrigan's team is killed&#x85; and he won't be the last. The slaughter continues until Harrigan confronts the predator in a fight that only one of them will survive.After an enjoyable first instalment this sequel is a bit disappointing&#x85; it isn't bad; just not as good as the first. Danny Glover is a good lead but doesn't have the presence of Arnie. This problem is even greater for the rest of the protagonists; the first film had the likes of Carl Weathers, Bill Duke and Jesse Ventura while here we have Rubén Blades, Bill Baxton and Maria Conchita Alonso&#x85; and the last of these is the toughest! Gary Busey is pretty solid as Keyes even if his character is a little cliché. They try to make up for the lack of tough characters with some fairly forced comedy. If you can ignore the flaws there is a lot of over the top action; most of it fairly bloody and it does build nicely on the events of the previous film even if there are no returning characters. Overall this is an okay action film that fans of the previous film will probably enjoy; just not as much.

It does nothing to advance the Predator mythology, where they came from, why they're here, etc. We eventually find out that they hunt for the sport of it, but that's not really demonstrable here, contrary to what I see some other reviewers rave about. The main Predator here seems to be focused on a territorial gang war in the heart of Los Angeles, but doesn't seem constrained to taking out just the bad guys. He's an equal opportunity killer who picks his targets and puts them all away with equal impunity, drug lords, cops and civilians alike. The idea that Lieutenant Mike Harrigan (Danny Glover) gets to go one on one with a Predator and come up victorious seemed like an over the top stretch to me, and all the relentless action without a meaningful story just wore out it's welcome after a while. It wasn't until the full complement of Predators made their presence felt at the end of the story that I figured out why they primarily went after the Jamaican drug gang. I think it had to do with who had the better looking dreadlocks.

The Original was a powerful, poetic, and beautifully Photographed Jungle Adventure with Horror-Sci-Fi overtones, extreme Action, and one of the Great Movies of its Era. Perhaps Arnold's best.This one was and is a major disappointment. The Tone of the thing was ugly, loud, and crass from the very beginning. The Movie never settled down and continued to irritate and annoy for most of the Running Time. Danny Glover is miscast and beyond His capabilities here, Bill Paxton is slightly amusing but over-acts to the extreme, Gary Busey is OK but hardly saves the Movie. The rest of the Cast go through the motions and are unremarkable.The ending was the best part visually as it took a breath and restrained from the shouting and Over-the-Top antics and let the Film glide to a more natural conclusion. But most of the Film is so obnoxious, with ear piercing Dialog and less than involving Shoot-Em-Ups.Most of the Characters are unlikeable and get on the nerves, both the Cops and Criminals. The Movie lacks elegance and barely passes as Entertainment. Only the most calloused Action Fans and forgiving Sci-Fi Types will garner any enjoyment out of this mostly mishandled and ultimate semi-failure. Average and typical at best.

And while director Stephen Hopkins had changed the setting from an actual jungle to the urban jungle was a choice that he executed quite nicely, because it really did work nicely on the screen.The story in Predator 2 is not a continuation of the first movie, nor did it really have any particular ties to the first movie, aside from the predator creature and concept - at least to what I observed.There is a great amount of action in the movie, just as in the first movie. But actually they upped it from the first movie to a more intense level. So be prepared for a lot more gunfire.The urban setting was at first a somewhat odd choice, but it really, really worked quite well, and it was a thrill to have the movie set in a sprawling city.As for the acting, well, while the cast list really holds some great names in each their own right, then I wasn't that particularly thrilled about Danny Glover for the lead part. He is not a bad actor, don't get me wrong, I just have problems with seeing him as a proper action actor. Kevin Peter Hall returns for his formidable predator performance once again.Predator 2 is essentially action-packed from the very beginning and up to the very end, with heaps of action and thrills in between.As with the previous movie, then the special effects team handled their job formidably and presented some great eye-candy for the audience. The predator design is so wonderful and there were some really nice treats in the details once we went inside their spaceship.An entertaining movie with just a few minor bumps along the way, but quite well worth a place in the Predator franchise. "},{"Title":"Entertaining and under-rated... MCU prototype?","Date":"9 November 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" If there's a failed precursor to the Marvel Comic-book Universe this is possibly it.On a list of movies that got a critical kicking they didn't quite deserve, Predator 2 is a comic book movie that promised a crossover franchise and although flawed, it holds up well 25 years later and in many ways is ahead of its time. Heavily inspired by the Dark Horse comic that featured Dutch's brother as an LA gang cop, the lack of Arnie, who's wage demands were knocked back by the studio, clearly went against the movie from the start.In retrospect, Danny Glover's resourceful, seasoned LA gang cop is sound replacement and delivers in what is possibly his best action role. Compared to Murtagh in Lethal Weapon half a decade earlier, he looks a lot younger, fitter and buff enough as a believable opponent for the Predator.The supporting characters are total comic-book and right on the money.These larger than life, stereotypes fit beautifully into this world and there are so many of them, Colombians, Jamaicans, Bill Paxtons, that you don't have time to stop and think about their lack of dimension. They're bubble gum, and fun. A real treat for me watching 25 years on is the atmosphere and feel of the classic 80's sci-fi movies still celebrated today. Predator 2 almost seems to exist in the same universe as RoboCop, borrowing heavily from the aesthetic and attitude of the media, the overcrowded police station and Lewis in Maria Conchita Alonso, which is something that may have seemed derivative at the time but in retrospect, would not seem out of place now with the MCU. Drawing on many influences of the time, throwing them in a pot and seeing what comes out the other end is part of Predator 2's charm but also part of the problem, especially as it veers a little too close into ALIENS territory later in the film, however I can live with that and looking back makes me nostalgic for a great era of sci-fi. But it's not without flaws and there are a couple of problems I had at the time that are amplified now. On release, I felt the film was toned down, not as violent as the first and that it had possibly been edited for a lower rating. In retrospect, it's actually a far more violent film than the original, there's blood and bullets everywhere, but what I was picking up on and what I see clearly now, is more to do with the way Predator 2 is lit and shot. Stephen Hopkins was hired to direct only his 3rd film coming straight off the back of Nightmare On Elm St 5, a film that is widely regarded as the weakest of that franchise and aside from Lost In Space has mostly directed TV since.So it's no surprise that a lot of the scenes in Predator 2 look far less cinematic that they should and instead have more of an X-Files vibe. The lighting is too bright and colourful, whilst watching, you can't shake the fact that this is staged and shot on a set. In my view, it suffers the same problem as RoboCop 2 whereby the lower budget of the preceding film gave the original a rough and ready look, where the sequels ramp up the production values to the point where everything looks far too polished and fake. But crucially, the make up and blood looks almost clean enough to eat and the death scenes are just underwhelming.Exploding heads and chests are replaced with sparklers and cut away shots, which work well in the right context, the Reservoir Dogs torture is a great example of getting it right, but here the camera avoids everything so there's no pay off. You just get fragments and sweeps which are very effective in terms of replicating comic book panels but after the imaginative bloodbath of the first movie, you're left feeling short changed.During the opening sequence there are some brilliant cuts shot between VHS camera's, grainy, hand-held, shaky that represent the view of the media. They look far more realistic for my money and that's how I would have liked to have seen this picture shot.Overall, Predator 2 is a bold and innovative precursor to the MCU.It's a movie that appears to have been designed by a studio with bold plans for a bigger universe, heavily hinting at crossover potential and I would have loved to have seen this era of Fox expand into the Alien Vs Predator territory it hinted at, rather than the damp squibs that came a decade later. Ultimately, Fox picked an inexperienced director who didn't have the resume of a John McTiernan or James Cameron, presumably so that they had more control but in doing so, paid the price with a sequel that almost kills but lacks the genuine wonder and sincerity in its execution, that made the first movie so compelling.

Predator 2 does have error hole the story shouldn't be set 10.years after first movie in 1997 Los Angeles because the movie was released in 1990 so it should be set in that year. Kevin Peter Hall returns as Predator. When Gary Busey say's The Lions, The Tigers, The Bears, o may your the Lion and this is the Jungle. Predator 2 the story is set in Urban jungle and is different than the first one. You are 100% right predator 2 doesn't copy predator 1 it has his own story. Predators did copy the first movie. Oh and AVPR Requiem they stole the line from Arnold Schwarzenegger Predator! I think both movies are great. I love both of them. I only liked Predators because the story was set in an amazon Jungle and it relaxed me. Predators does have a lot of mistakes and I hate it. Lauernce Fishburne from The Matrix and CSI with who was he talking? when he set the fire for Brody and his friends ugh. The rest of the Predators film I don't like. Predator 2 is the best one! It is better than Predators! I love Predator 2. Danny Glover and Gary Busey are the main cast and they completely rock. Predator 2 is the best action movie ever.

Because I loved N.Y.C since...ever actually,eagles head remind me it was sculptures from Chrysler Building. But the movie depict is located in L.A. So I was very confused about this architectural item and couldn't understand why Chrysler Building was shown in this L.A movie. Now, I know it's because the first script should be located in N.Y.C and because of financial aspects, J&J Thomas (writers)changed location of shooting. I guess Chrysler Bg set was made (and shot) before writers relocated action on CA. In a word or 100, don't watch Predator 2 as a mirror sequel but as a kind of variation of the first one.

The film Predator 2, really notched up the special effects and body count, having more freedom with a massive budget. Even with the huge amount of dollars spent towards Predator 2, it didn't really translate into a great action-horror film like the original.Danny Glover was an interesting pick in the lead role as the human combatant to the predator. Other players included stars, Bill Paxton, Gary Busey, Adam Baldwin and Morton Downey Jr, each mixing together as rude co-characters defusing Glover's progress to catch the predator. The story is pretty ridiculous, violent in nature creating an entertaining but senseless plot. The film however does get slow at times, forming some major pacing issues. The ending could have had a better fight scene but adding the spaceship as the final fighting platform was a cool touch. If you like the original Predator than the direct sequel is definitely worth your time.

It's a very disappointing sequel, I had very low expectations going in to this for the fact that Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't in it, but it managed to be even more of a let down than I expected, there is no thrills, even when the predator is on screen I didn't felt any bit of terror as I did with the original, and getting the creature to say stupid comedic lines didn't help. The only redeeming factor about this movie is Danny Glover in the lead role, he is a very charismatic actor and the confidence in his performance is very evident, it was nice to see him shine as a main character, even if he deserved so much better. My main issue with the movie is that it was made for no reason other than making money, the director isn't the same, the cast isn't the same, the studio just decided to throw together a sequel with a bunch of people because the first one was a success, the beautiful set pieces and the very clear hard work that went it to making the original is clearly absent here. Little horror, too much mediocre action, it's a very disappointing sequel and I couldn't possibly recommend Predator 2 to anyone.

When I watch the original, I watch it for its machismo, bravado, dirty dozen in the jungle vs. an alien hunter story. When I watch this sequel, I see a dark, Gothic, ghost story where the ghost is really an alien hunter able to camouflage and haunt its victims. I may be the only one who gets that vibe from this film, but the cemetery scene is what really dangled it in front of me.The whole subway scene is epic and brilliant in its own right, Danny Glover's character may not have the physical presence of Arnold Schwarzenegger, but he has the right type of attitude to keep me interested, and he surrounds himself with the most colourful characters living in the corrupt future city he fights crime (and an alien) in.Alan Silvestri's score is once again phenomenal, pumping, altering it just enough to give it a familiar yet fresh vibe. The new motif's he introduces are perfectly fitting, taking the jungle to the city.All in all a film I love just as much as the original (and to be honest, I think I may have watched this one more than the original).

In a very violent future Los Angeles (the movie was filmed in 1990, but takes place in 1997) 2 major drug cartels have turned the city into a war zone. It's also during a massive heat wave. The perfect hunting environment for a certain alien hunter.The star of the movie is Danny Glover, fresh off Lethal Weapon 2. He played Lt. Mike Harrigan a veteran, and grizzled, Los Angeles police officer. He is similar to Dutch (Arnold's character from the first movie) in that he has rules and cares for his teammates.The movie starts off with a shoot out between cops and Columbian Drug Cartel. The cops are able to drive the bad guys into their hideout, and while those coke whore are reloading, something crashes through the ceiling and wipes them out... I think you know where this is going.The movie plays out differently then the first one, where during the course of the events it seems like the Predator takes a fixation on Danny Glover, first taking out the Columbian Cartel they were fighting, then a group of Jamaican Cartel members, but then it gets weird.The Predator goes back to where he killed the Jamaicans, and find Danny Glover's partner and takes him out. Now he was armed, but there was no conflict and his gun was only drawn in self defense really.I know the whole honor code of the Predators is from the comics and such, but the movies is what established that line of thought so I stick with that.Then the Predator stalks Danny Glover killing the head of the Jamaican Voodoo Posse right after he leaves, leaving part of his partners necklace in a cemetery.The climax is really neat with the audience getting too see a Predator ship, internal and external for the first time really. Plus multiple Predators at once too.Visually the movie was good. The story was solid, and different enough from the first to distinguish it.I would have marked this higher if they had done more connection to the first. For example, Gary Busey's character Keyes, he knows about the Predator from debriefing tapes that Dutch and Anya gave after the events of the first movie. But they were cut from the final production (not sure if ever filmed) but that would have been a great tie-in, and making the connection cleaner, at least for me. "}{"Title":"A worthy sequel","Date":"24 May 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" Predator 2 takes us into a then-futuristic 1997 Los Angeles, a city that has become a war zone between Colombian and Jamaican drug gangs, with the police caught in the middle. Perfect hunting ground for another Predator.This Predator is a lot more macho than the one in the first, taking on whole gangs of people by himself. As a result, there is much less suspense involved, with the film delving a little into slasher movie territory with it's unstoppable killer, but the creature still makes for a most menacing foe. This one has even more hardware to play with.Arnie refused to star, but rather than go with another muscle-bound action hero, the film-makers went with a more workman-like hero, maverick cop Mike Harrigan played by Danny Glover. Danny makes for a likable hero, and proves more than up to the task of taking on the alien foe. Bill Paxton is amusing as the loudmouthed 'Lone Ranger', annoying at first, but you come to admire him. Maria Conchita Alonso is a heroine very much in the Vasquez mold. Gary Busey is cool as Keyes, a 'Fed' who clearly knows a lot more about what's going on that he's letting on. While antagonistic, it's difficult not to feel some sympathy when he tries to capture the Predator in an elaborate trap - one unfortunately the Predator can see right through.The film has a relentlessness characteristic of the best actioners, and throughout it's running time, it never slows down for a minute, even in talky scenes.The climax proves to be exhilarating, though it's here the film starts to 'borrow' a little too heavily from other movies. The sequence with Keyes trying to trap the alien has too much of a whiff of Aliens about it - not helped by an earlier scene that had a 'cameo' of sorts with a familiar-looking skull - while the rooftop battle smacks a bit of Blade Runner. The final showdown though is worth it, a one-on-one between Mike and the Predator that provides heart-in-mouth suspense.Not as good as the first film, but a far better sequel than could have been hoped for.

Comparing them would be pointless, obviously the first the great one, setting the standard for the sequel, but in my opinion Stephen Hopkins does a great work adjusting the theme to his own taste and in terms of setting the mood and atmosphere, he even surpasses the original. I understand many people didn't like the fact that it didn't take place in the jungle, that the mood is now not only mysterious but also gritty, but in my opinion it is only for the better, the slaughterhouse district is a suitable choice for the intelligent extraterrestrial skull-collector to reside. Predator 2 focuses much more on Predator, and has a lot less character development, the acting is noticeably worse, and you don't get memorable witty comments from Danny Glover, or classic funny one-liners like get to the choppa'! from Arnold Schwarzenegger in the first, you do however see a much more diverse set of scenery, which are always very much connecting to the original theme. I personally really liked the final fight in the catacomb-looking tomb, but the rooftop scenes are also noteworthy. This sequel is criminally underrated, I however, recommend it.

It is not as polished as its predecessor, but it does work. By transplanting the action from the jungle to an urban environment, the sequel manages to feel original and does not seem as though it is a simple retread of what has been seen before. Combined with the change in setting is a change in cast, which also works to ensure that the second movie does not unduly ape the first. The film succeeds best when it evolves the character of its titular creature - in terms of technology and the Predator's outlook on hunting, innocence and the suitability of its trophies, the film manages to provide a pleasing depth. The movie's greatest stumble comes in its sometimes uncertain tone. It is mostly serious and action oriented and yet occasional lapses into surprisingly broad humour (including one bizarrely and exceptionally misplaced comedic sequence during the film's climax) undermine an otherwise well crafted action film.Interestingly, the film's post-final-confrontation tag sequence is very, very good - better even than the comparable scene from the first movie. The ending sequence is simultaneously ominous, thrilling and suggestive of (potential) future instalments - a great ending can cover a multitude of sins and in this case, the strength of the film's denouement is such that it leaves the viewer suddenly anxious to see the rest of the story - unfortunately as yet not fully explored.

Then I watched this movie... Honestly, all I can say is that this was a great movie. It was absolutely fantastic and could even be as good as the first one. Im not going to explain the full plot or anything at the moment because you can easily look that up, but I am going to say that Danny Glover done a great job as being the protagonist, who basically in short is looking for the Predator. The Predator is looking for humans to hunt for as a sport. People complain about this movie saying that the Predator is killing random people, which was not the purpose of the first movie. The Predator is in a new kind of jungle, L.A, where he can easily find targets. We got to learn more about the Predator himself, his weapons and what his ship looks like.

It is, of course, markedly inferior to the original film but who could seriously expect otherwise? It does follow the earlier film's template, however, in that it mixes science-fiction, action and horror in equal measure. The addition of the L.A. setting is good. It's an L.A. of the future of course &#x96; the streets are a war zone between gangs of criminals, and the Predator steps into this violent world and makes it even worse.

The lead rogue cop played by Danny Glover and alien expert Gary Busey are fine. While the story is entertaining and there are some nice idea's scenes and set pieces, setting it in the then future of 1997 was unnecessary and its credibility suffers. The film is let down further by the almost comical overacting sub-characters and it losses the semi-realism of the first.It's packed with Predator action graphic decapitations, shootings and mutilated bodies. The practical effects, accessories and costumes from Stan Winston look great, and Kevin Peter Hall as the Predator is once again out of this world. The music score is excellent and carries the same themes from the first as to are the sound effects. For fans an Alien skull show up on the wall of the Predator's trophy room (to entice an AVP) and a tremendous thought provoking ending.Stephen Hopkins gives an enjoyable sci-fi but the film just let down by it's Verhoevenesque future, hammy acting and over-the-top stereotypes.

While not nearly as good as the first Predator it is not a bad movie.Basically the plot is similar to the first film but this time the Predator hunts down people in Los Angeles.Schwarzennegar is not in this film. He was awesome in the first Predator so it is kind of sad that he is not in the sequel. However you should also remember that the Predator is more important to the film than Arnold was. However still I was hoping he would be in this film.Danny Glover instead plays the lead in this film. WHile not nearly as good as Schwarzenneggar he is a good actor, not great but good. Glover does a decent job in the lead but he uses some of the worst language you will hear in a film.The rest of the supporting characters in this film I did not like at all. Predator 2 has a really bad cast compared to the first predator. There are no Carl Weathers and Jessie Venturas to bolster this cast, instead there are Gary Buseys and BIll Paxtons. Paxton is awful in this film. The supporting cast in this film is not developed enough so that when some of them die you do not feel sad for them like when the characters in the original died.Another thing I did not care for was how bad the language was at times. It seems that everyone just says bad words just to do it and it really kills the dialogue.I did like things in the film though.One thing I liked is that they further develop and show you new things about the predator that were not known in the first. Like how they only attack species that have weopons, do not attack children with fake weopons, and do not attacks expectant mothers. This goes to show that they are not all bad and that they have morals which is good. Basically they think that the Predator may have killed everyone but that is proved to be false if you think about it because of the morals that I just spoke of. The Predator gets in a lot of action and there is one extremely funny part involving the Predator in an old womans bathroom.Also the duel between Glover and the Predator is pretty good. It is great action and a pretty intense battle.This film has a pretty sub par plot and bad language but it also develops the Predator in a good way and has some great action. An above average film but not without its flaws. I do recommend it though.

In the year 1997, Los Angeles is in the midst of an intense heat wave and a gang war between the Colombians and the Jamaicans has engulfed the streets. As if that wasn't bad enough for Lieutenant Mike Harrigan of the LAPD, these conditions have attracted the attention of an intergalactic hunter, another Predator. A Predator on the loose in Los Angeles; as much as I loved watching the original Predator go wild in the jungle, this concept seemed to be a sure-fire hit for me. Well, the reality of it wasn't so kind and the results come out a bit mediocre.I had a hard time determining what it was about this film that failed to impress me. It wasn't the storyline, as it was a decent, simple plot. The visual effects in the movie were also impressive for their time period, considering it was all done before computers made the job easier. We are also treated to a good amount of violence and gore, as we'd come to expect from the franchise. So what about the film makes it so average? I guess it would have to be the writing and the acting. There were a lot of moments that had me rolling my eyes at how clichéd or campy they were. One of the biggest contributors was Danny Glover in his role as Harrigan; every line he delivered felt as if it was ripped from some other generic angry cop movie (for a great example, check out the scene where Harrigan is getting chewed out by his superior following the initial street battle). Glover spends the entire movie running around, waving his gun, and yelling at people. Bill Paxton...ugh...the man was grating on my nerves from the moment his character was introduced. Paxton arrives as Jerry Lambert, the newest member to Harrigan's team and a renowned lone ranger; his loud-mouth over-acting had me counting the minutes until the Predator would pay him a visit. Maria Conchita Alonso, Rubén Blades, and Gary Busey were the only cast who didn't annoy me in some fashion, though neither Alonso or Blades has a very large role and Busey wasn't immune to groan-inducing dialogue (i.e. the lions/tigers/bears bit).Though, I don't know if these issues are with the script, the cast, or a bit of both. Regardless, it's enough to prevent the film from being of the same caliber as the original. The effects are great and I'll always count the Predator as one of the greatest sci-fi creatures, but this sequel could've used a bit more polishing and a little less camp in it.

But this movie is meant to be a sequel to the original Predator that starred Arnold Schwargenneger. As a sequel, I would brand it as one of those sequels that essentially have nothing new to offer but are their predecessors done in a different way. In the original Predator, we have Arnold and his team of commandos venturing into the jungle hoping to find some human enemies to deal with and later realize that what they are facing is out of this world.The battleground was the jungle and the match was between Arnold and Predator. The sequel has not much new to offer. All it does is change the battleground to the city and this time a city cop played by Glover has taken up the task of hunting the hunter namely the Predator. There was some decently done shots in this movie, some battles that will not fail to keep the action-genre fans happy. But all-in-all there are unnecessary vulgarities in the movie. There are obscene dialogs and more brutal deaths and dead bodies. It seems like they have been added to make the movie more spicy.What is interesting is the ending scene of the movie. Glover has won the battle and to his horror, he sees more of them come towards him. But all they do is pick the dead body of their fellow Predator and take him away. One of the Predators nods in Glover's direction and hands him a gun. The gun is very old. One interpretation of this scene could be that the Predator meant to tell him that they have been around for a very long time and have been hunting humans as a personal sport or a hobby. This leaves you with unanswered questions. The movie could have dwelled more about the history of Predators rather than just give a lame hint in the end that their history was not a short one.The movie could have taken off in a more creative direction perhaps explaining the purpose, origin and history of these creatures. Instead the movie chooses to be a pure action flick packed with a lot of kills, explosions and reel type action. From this point of view, the movie is entertaining though not much new material can be found here. Overall, a movie worth watching though could have been done in a better way.

The director delivered exactly what a fan wanted with urban LA providing the sweaty, suspenseful atmosphere and background, loads of action and the Predator kicking ass. They've also introduced a new array of Predator weapons which don't seem out of place at all. The Predator related murders getting confused and mixed up with all the crime and gangster related violence in LA, was pure genius or at least a very good move. The opening sequence to reintroduce the Predator was amazing. This movie was extremely realistic and gory as well. It is too under-appreciated. To give you a clue of what type and kind of people did'nt like this movie - Paul Anderson was one of them who spoke out against this movie.

You would have thought that the absence of Arnie and the quiet, tension building jungle would wreck the film. Instead, it see's a different side to the Predator.Los Angles is the setting for this film, with a surprising date of 1997. The view of this year from a 1990 perspective is not bad at all. The settings and cast are all great, and make the film very atmospheric, because cleverly, the cast are all very stereotypical of modern American people - Bill Paxton plays a young, out going rookie cop with terrible jokes, the Jamaican drug gangs.. well enough said there. And Danny Glover plays a good typical cop, who looks as though he's had experience at his job and says a great line to Bill Paxton Welcome to the war (upon Paxtons joining of the cops) The Predators arrival is well noted after some Jamaican drug gang members get slaughtered and hung up. Of course, the Predator takes people out all the way through the film - his calling card being to hang his victims up, legs first. Somehow though, you get the impression that the Predator just doesn't belong in this city, and that he played a much better role in the first Predator film.The special effects are really no different than the first film. The predators invisibility still shown very cleverly by the magnified scenery, giving the outline of his body so we can see him. Again though, this works a lot better in the first film, because he camouflaged nicely in all the jungle. The addition of more weapons is very interesting though - a deadly round Frisbee and spear come in very handy.Of course though, the most talked about part of this film is the scene in which we see an alien head in the predators trophy cabinet. Its Not just any old alien head, but one from the 'Alien' films.After people saw this during the 90's, they realised what had to come soon..AVP! (Aliens vs. Predator, 2004) Its no big deal now of course, but it would have been interesting 15 years ago.I would love to say this is an excellent film, but somehow I think that the jungle suited the Predator best. But, for the fans out there of action, I would say have a go! Its a gory film, but the neat additions to the first film do a lot of justice.

The claustrophobia is gone, but the amount of victims is vastly increased, and the hunt begins.The film is set in LA. It is an increasingly hot summer, and gang warfare, crime and murder is on the up. The LAPD wages a constant battle against the scum, but it seems a vigilante is wiping out some of the biggest criminals. Danny Glover stars as Lieutenant Mike Harrigan, who with his small team- Danny, Leona, and Jerry is trying to find out who is causing these deaths, as well as keeping an eye on the chaos around them and remembering that they each have a habit of destroying property. As his team closes in the killer the feds tell him to back off, so he knows there is something big going on. When his team members and others continue to be slaughtered, he catches a glimpse of the killer- The Predator who can become invisible at the touch of a button, and wipe out anyone with ease. Gary Busey and his team including Robert Davi attempt to catch the Predator but fail, and it has set its sights on Glover as its next victim. A final encounter approaches, but it may not take place on Harrigan's terms.Predator 2 is a letdown after the first film was so good. The action, tension and excitement here is toned down and inferior, but luckily it is still above average. We lose Arnie, but Glover does well as the cop with a fighting spirit. The supporting cast is good, Alonso is feisty, Paxton is as good as always but not given as much to do as I would have liked, Busey is his usual scary self, as is Davi, and Blades is OK. However, the sense of teamwork that should have been present, that was a strong part of the original, is gone. There are many good visual effects here, improving in some ways on the original, and the Predator has a few new and interesting weapons at his disposal. It just lacks the spark of the original though, and does not create much excitement. The dialogue is not as good, but average action stuff, and the direction is solid but does not have the style and grasp of technique that McTiernen has.

We get the first introduction to the predator. Danny glover plays a cop who seems to always be getting himself in trouble. Other notable cast members are Bill Paxton, and that other guy with his own comedy show i forget his name. This so wasn't the right part for Danny Glover, i just didn't see him in a Predator movie. Bill Paxton plays a cocky side kick who is funny sometimes. Back to the movie, After the bodies of some of the gang members are hung from the roof with their skinned bodies hanging, no one seems to know what is going on except a group of FBI's agents who don't let LAPD know whats going on. This movie revolves around the gangs more then the predator. Who seems to be the sidestory. I think this movie should have aloud more predator time. It could be me? This movie has a good pace, its never boring. And the climax started a revelation Alien vs. Predator, with the skull of the Alien aboard their ship. I think they should have put Arnold back in this movie as a ex military guy now a cop in Los Angeles. Since he seems to know how to deal with the Predators more then Danny Glover.

It just didn't capture the magic of the first film.  The characters, while more realistic and deep, lacked the gung-ho appeal of the first film's grunts.  Also, instead of the original's extreme suspense punctuated by bursts of action, they chose to make Predator 2 a straight-forward action movie.  The problem is that the director didn't provide the superdramatic visual pizazz that all great action films require.  Just look at the camera angles and direction used in the sequel then the original.  Director John McTiernan's work on the first film still looks modern and stylish to this day, while the sequel by Stephen Hopkins already looks a tad dated. Having said that however, watching Predator 2 again without the memory of the first film interfering, Predator 2 is actually rather enjoyable.  The story does a good job of expanding the Predator concept and revealing further details.  The actors give good performances, the score by Alan Silvestri is as effective as ever, and the second half of the movie is continuous action.  While not nearly as good as the first film, it is a entertaining film on its own and better than its reputation would suggest.

The Predator, the evil space alien hell-bent on killing innocent human beings for the purpose of making their skulls into its own personal trophies, is really a symbol of the obstacles minorities in America face on a daily basis.So instead of an action film, Predator 2 is a film about the struggle of minorities in America and how they will eventually triumph over the evils that are ignorance and prejudice.So what is the signifigance of the Jamaican VooDoo Posse, or the antique gun that Danny Glover wins at the end of the film?

Long, long, long underrated Predator 2 seems to be finally getting the recognition and respect it deserves.it looks like pure gold to those miserable cynics who disregarded it when it first came out because Arnie wasn't in it.Fans of Alan Silvestris score of the first film can take comfort in the fact that all of his cool themes are back - they were rudely ditched from AvP - and more evolved. It's probably the most engaging score he's done. His Latin drums, sinister Hermannesue strings, haunting urban sound effects and occultist voodoo chants dominate every scene and give each one its own unique voice.Everything from set-design and cinematography to sound-design and film editing is nothing short of brilliant. If you think I'm overreacting just watch the film and see for yourself. There's nothing mass-produced, or conveyor-belt, about Predator 2. Twentieth Century Fox chucked loads of money at it to make it the most sophisticated sequel it could be. Everyone involved seems to have made a huge effort and done their absolute best.Sure, we all love Arnie but, with his bulging biceps and brick-wall mentality, he's not the kind of screen icon your ordinary film-goer can really relate to. Danny Glover, on the other hand, is the common man personified irritable, durable and beset by myriad woes. In an obvious nod to the recent success of 'Lethal Weapon', Glover is once again cast as a police lieutenant fighting a bloody battle with drug runners on the streets of LA. The twist is that now it's 1997, the drug lords are out of control and the streets of South Central have basically become one giant war zone. Plus there's a heat wave on. And then this bloody alien shows up,The rest of the cast are great, too, 'Predator 2' is more interested in character than how much a guy can bench, so here the muscles are replaced with mouths Bill Paxton essays one of his most memorable roles as brash country cop Jerry 'The Lone Ranger' Lambert, Maria Conchita Alonso is perfect no-bullshit action-heroine fodder as Glover's partner Cantrell and Gary Busey performs his usual eye-rolling, wisecracking shtick to perfection as shady Special Agent Keyes, a role originally intended for Arnie's big comeback. Our gain.It's got great action sequences,The original was essentially an action spectacular with a spot of blood and a touch of sci-fi. 'Predator 2' is all over the place is it a police procedural, a 'Robocop' style future satire, a science fiction thriller, a gangland drama, a black comedy, a monster movie? The answer is all of the above, plus everything the original was, leading to a fantastically unsettling sense of unpredictability, as a series of radical tonal shifts take the move from all-out action to gut-churning suspense in a heartbeat.Conceptually, PREDATOR 2 is the perfect sequel. It does not attempt to recreate the first film, but rather moves the setting to the next logical location The concrete jungles of LA. The Thomas Brothers turn in another action-packed script that attempts to outdo the original at every turn. There is more blood, more violence, and more gadgets as this sleek new urban Predator sets out to collect his human trophies using metal shurikens, razorwire nets, and spears. The redesigned costume and differing attack patterns show us that the Predator race is as varied and diverse as our own, which leads up to a shocking finale aboard the Predator spacecraft. Danny Glover offers a welcomed change of pace from Arnold and the gang, playing a breakneck cop with no regard for authority. PREDATOR 2 comes as close as any sequel could to reproducing the thrills and non-stop action of the original, while giving us something new entirely.

In the tradition of bad sequels, Predator 2 has none of the thrill of the original, and more unfortunately, none of the fascination that the Predator creature once offered to moviegoers.Combined with appalling acting, and 'cheap' special effects, and lots of unnecessary blood and gore, we get something similar to an awful scare fest.

For better or worse, it just can't match the original, although it's still a highly entertaining trophy sequel. The lousy reputation it has been branded with doesn't do it any favours, because it's far from bad. Truly this is one frenetic story that shifts from the cops battling rival drug gangs (Columbians and Jamaicans), to taking on the Predator. Yep Danny Glover finds himself smack right in the middle of the nightmare, and eventually playing a cat 'n mouse game with the predator. Glover is suitably fine in the lead role, but it's the support that features largely. Bill Paxton's loose cannon cowboy-cop is fun. Maria Conchita provides bite. Rueben Blades solidly works off Glover and Gary Busey's edgy intensity always diverts as a fed. Robert Davi and Morton Downey Jr. appear in minor support. And donning the predator suit again is Kevin Peter Hall. The novelty of the creation might not be as potent, but still it's an admirable creation that Hall fitted perfectly and brought to life with personality.Music director Stephen Hopkins makes his debut, and floods the screen with relentless flashes of sweaty style, and hardcore action. Watch for the cracking climax. While keeping with the blood n' guts of the original, it demonstrates a far nastier quality (which replaces the original's break-neck tension) and this could be associated to the seedy, rundown locations of an urban jungle that's L.A. The film has that sombre, rough, ugly and dirty feel. You could say it's pretty much the same routine (or set-up), just done in a different environment. The high-octane camera-work, blends in with the rapid editing and music score is explosively arousing. It's quite excessive, and pumped up on those technical fronts, but never becomes a mess. Well not much of one. The plot moves quickly by not giving too much away and throws in some interesting references, or possibilities to where this franchise could go. Sure reading too much into it can bring out the ridiculousness, and senselessness of the exercise, but we're not expecting art here. An unjustly mangled sequel.

The predator comes to Los Angeles to hunt down people, which basically consists only of drug dealers and cops. The cops are led by Lt. Mike Harrigan (Glover), a tough cop with a chip on his shoulder. His team is attempting to fight off Jamaican and Columbian drug dealers, all in the meanwhile the predator comes to town. The predator commences in killing drug dealers and skinning them without leaving a single trace. Harrigan and his team are stunned as to who is orchestrating these murders. Meanwhile a federal agent Peter Keyes (Busey) seems to possibly have more information as to what is going on. But sooner or later Harrigan and his team encounter this strange, violent creature, which leads to an all out war to stop it.Predator 2 contains very good special effects. The makeup effects make the Predator look stunningly realistic. And some of the sets are truly amazing looking. This sequel also begins to answer a few mysterious questions that fans of the original had.However these virtues don't really make Predator 2 a good movie. Danny Glover tries his hardest but the script is more into the action than the dialogue. Gary Busey I feel should have been the lead character. He was far more interesting than Glover's character, and in the end Busey's acting had more charisma. The clichés also arise in the form of annoying news reporters, a lead cop who's too into his job, and generic shootout action. The rest of the actors just kind of sit around with dialogue that makes them sound like idiots, and just leads most of them to their deaths. Bill Paxton's character Jerry Lambert for instance is very annoying and unlikable.I understand that most people will see this for its action, and that will more than likely entertain them. However it is not often that movies centered around action, forgetting good dialogue and characters, end up very good. While the original Predator movie added intrigue and mystery to to its title alien, this film ditches that for a few high pitch action sequences. Which while entertaining do not make up for the malfunctioning rest of the film. Also the Jamaican drug dealers never truly add anything to the story. I kept thinking they were hinting at the Predators being spiritual beings involved in voodoo or something. But no, as it turns out the drug dealers are there only for a bunch of bloody kills.The Predator is not as interesting in this sequel as he was in the first. The jungle was a better setting than the urban jungle of Los Angeles. The original Predator was more about the build up of tension, and the mystique of the creature's reason for being on Earth. Predator 2 is all about the violent bloody payoff which hurts the title character. There are very few significant answers to what these Predators are all about, and when the answers do appear there is still not much insight.Predator 2 suffers from bad dialogue and clichés. But mainly from a lack of interest in its title character, with the movie focusing more on the action. Special effects do not save a movie, sorry. I give Predator 2 a 1.5 out of 4. Go watch the first instead.

Three years after a claw-faced alien hunter eliminated a US Army Rescue Team stuck in the jungles of Central America, another alien drops in to takes its place and have a hunt in Los Angeles. Such is the premise for Predator 2. However, while the first Predator was twenty years ago, the time frame for Predator 2 is 1997 - ten years after the South American incident. However, this time a top secret government agency led by Gary Busey knows about the creature. They have gone by the testimony by the two survivors of the first Predator (although neither appear in the sequel). Busey also relates witnesses have seen the creature in Iwo Jima, Vietnam, and Cambodia. Apparently, the creature is drawn by heat and conflict. No wonder this one takes place amidst the drug wars of Los Angeles While conflict and gore are much like the first movie, there are aspects of Predator 2 which are imaginative and different. One fun aspect was Morton Downey, Jr as an over zealous reporter. Another was the use of science by the good guys. While the first movie has military grunts guessing about the creature, this top team knows the Predator can only see in the infra-red spectrum. We also learn a little more about the Predator itself. Believe it or not, it show ethics in its hunt. For example, in one scene when the creature attacks a commuter train, the cops are amazed that the only ones attacked were the armed civilians. Moreover, it spares one cop who was pregnant. Also, the last 30 to 40 minutes will physically wear an audience out. It is the typical out-of-the-frying pan into-the-fire suspense as Danny Glover attempts to confront the creature in a long chase sequence. It is also good to see that Danny accomplishes what Arnold couldn't. The best part is a wonderful twist on the ending, but to reveal that would truly be a crime. It does have some pratfalls, though. First is the very prejudicial lens of the story. Every Jamaican is obsessed with voodoo, drugs, and violence. Moreover, the violence and profanity pushes the limits even for hardcore testosterone freaks like me. Finally, the acting is less to be desired. With so many action stars like Danny Glover, Gary Busey, and Bill Paxton, you shouldn't expect a whole lot. Of course that is to be expected in an action film. But just once, can we do without a cop who is always obnoxious, smart-mouthed, smarter than his superiors, over zealous and reckless? Despite the flaws, action freaks will definitely enjoy Predator 2.

P2 takes the Alien hunter into the jungle of concrete and brick known as LA. The beauty of this film, as with the original is it is effectively a war film with an Alien thrown into the midst, there is a plot that goes on in the world of P2 that has nothing to do with the ET Hunter until he starts offing people on both sides of the fighting. Drug lords and their gangs are out of control, the streets are often turned into bloody open battlefields as the police battle the gangs for control of the city, an awesome plot which is then amplified by the arrival of the Predator. The opening scene is of one of these battles and brilliantly introduces all the main characters to the story (barring Bill Paxton's character). The acting is good, and you care about the characters (something I found occurs in 80's-early 90's films more than modern film) and even if you remove the predator from the film you have enough depth and character to make an film based entirely on the police vs. gangs.The only thing this film didn't do as well as the original was I feel the Predator's eyes, there were too big and Human looking in the extreme close ups, whereas the original had those small nasty looking ones. But that is all, and it is something you don't really notice until you watch the film in depth many times.Despite the poor rating on IMDb, and what bad things people say about this film it is as good as the original, it furthers the plot, it ups the ante, it does all the things a good sequel should do.

Unfortunately, it was not to the level of the first Predator, but that was expected because most sequels are worst then the previous movie. You will enjoy this film more if you had not seen the first one. If you had seen the first one, you should still enjoy this but not as much as the other. Nonetheless, Predator 2 is a pointless but entertaining sequel.Predator 2 takes place ten years, 1997, after the first Predator. Lt. Harrigan (Danny Glover) is a cop fighting the good war against drugs. Unfortunately, the major drug lords have been killed in a very brutal fashion. Harrigan's superiors tell him to stay out of it, but he knows something is wrong. His instincts are right when he discovers the person behind the murders is none other than the Predator, a human-hunting alien who likes to make trophies out of his victims' skulls. Can Harrigan stop the Predator? The biggest problem with this movie is its silly premise. The first Predator was fun with a Predator in the jungle stalking his prey. This one involves the Predator stalking its prey in the city of Los Angeles. Some people may enjoy this factor, but this reviewer was not one of them. It is much more exciting in the jungle of Central America. Arnold Schwarzenegger also rejected the opportunity to reprise his role as Dutch because he thought the premise was too ridiculous. You should not blame him because if you had read the script, you would have probably turned it down too.A minor problem is Danny Glover. As everyone should know, Danny Glover is no Arnold Schwarzenegger. In addition, as everyone should think, it is a lot less fun thinking of Danny Glover kicking a Predator's butt then it is Arnold Schwarzenegger. Danny Glover was not bad, but he just does not have that instant coolness that Arnold has. It would have been more entertaining if The Governator, aka Arnold Schwarzenegger, was in Predator 2 instead.There are some positives though. Many of these positives were improved from the previous Predator. The special effects were an improvement from the first Predator. The action, the violence, and the gore factor are also improved from the previous film. The way they expanded on the Predator by giving him more gadgets and weapons was very interesting. Bill Paxton is always enjoyable in his supporting roles.Overall, this is a decent film. This is not anything worthy of owning, but it is still entertaining. This would have been better if three things happened the first reason would be if the first did not exist, the second would be if you had never seen the first one, and the third would have been if you had seen the first one but were not comparing the two. This reviewer made a comparison to the first and that was his mistake. If you had not seen this film in a while, or would like to see it, you should rent it because it is still entertaining.

I remembered loving it before and sure enough that feeling came back after watching it again. I love this movie! People complain about the racism, stereotyping of ethnic groups, Danny Glovers is weak and blah blah blah&#133; It's a movie like any other where you can focus in on the shortcomings or the highlights. For me, what I loved so much about the first one was mainly the Predator, his strength, his weaponry, his predator code of life. If you dig on horror and Sci-fi like I do, then he's quite an admirable bad guy with more depth, mystery and originality than most villains&#133; So from that perspective, the second movie was great. It took the basic Ideas of the Predator, tweaked a few things and expanded on him, quite well IMO. They gave him a whole new bag of goodies which were done well and made for great eye candy.My take on this was similar to the first movie in that when the Predator's on screen, I'm glued to the screen. When the Predators not on screen, it's just another action movie. In essence the Predator really did it for me 100%. I hate to compare the two movies, so I won't as I think they are both great, in similar and different ways. Which one do I like better, depends on the day I suppose. I was really impressed by the route Stephen Hopkins took with the Predator. He gave him more on screen time, expanded on his already cool weapons, and I was especially captivated by the scene when the Predator treats his wounds with his handy dandy med kit. Things like this, how he built on him, but in the right ways made all the difference and gave the Predator more life, yet without revealing too much to the point of working yourself and future movies into a corner. So being that I weight the Predator movies mainly by the Predator himself, this movie really ranks up there for me! This unfortunately is what wasn't done in AVP as the Predators are not expanded on, they don't appear that strong or stealthy, and overall don't get a whole lot of screen time. Although AVP IMO shifted the balance of power more towards the Alien, so alien lovers will probably like AVP more than predator lovers.All this being said, I do have complaints or confusion on some moments of Predator 2. First off, admittedly Danny Glover was a little weak as the hero, but compared to Arnold (who's like my all time action idol) at the time who could you get to play the roll and pull it off more successfully? Danny Glover's acting is decent, and he's a big guy who's pretty physically fit, much more so than Lethal Weapon made him out to be, even though now he's getting up there in years. But even now a days who would you get to play his roll? The Rock? Vin Diesel? Moving on&#133; As another review pointed out, I didn't really like how in the subway scene, Bill Paxton empties two clip worth of bullets at the predator, many of which at close range and doesn't appear to even nick him, yet Glover hits him with every shot of his shotgun spewing green blood everywhere? How do you explain that? Was Paxton's gun too weak? It's not like a shotgun spray would penetrate any better than a single bullet (unless it wasn't a shotgun&#133;). Also the Predators pack doesn't offer much of a defense in terms of shielding, I call it a pack cause it's not really armor as most of his chest & stomach are reviled, more like heavy shoulder pads where his gear straps on to. But the movie as a whole seems to give you the impression that 20+ cops can't do what Glover can do, as with the opening scene in the movie where they seem helpless until Glover arrives on the scene. I guess my last gripe would be that in the first Predator, once Arnold goes toe to toe with the predator, he gets the crap beat out of him and only wins in the end because of the falling tree trap that slams the predator. Whereas in Predator 2, Glover slowly beats the crap out of the Predator until he ultimately kills him in a toe to toe mêlée match, starting with shooting his plasma canon, peppering him with a shotgun, cutting off his arm, then finally Frisbee to the belly to finally end it.

Arnold is MIA for this picture and the films suffers immensely. Replacing him is a gruff Danny Glover who could have felt right at home saying I'm getting too old for this sh*t. Glover does hold his own against the Predator in several scenes (Glover stands about 6'3). Much like the original, Predator 2 sports a good ensemble cast featuring Ruben Blades, Maria Conchita Alonso, Adam Baldwin, Robert Davi, Bill Paxton (who has now been killed by a Terminator, an Alien, and a Predator), and Gary Busey. And who could forget Kevin Peter Hall returning as the titular creature. Predator 2 is nice and gory too. It's definitely not rated PG-13 and that's a good thing. I do miss the jungle locales buy they did have to make a different movie. Don't expect it to be as good as Aliens was and you just might enjoy the hell out of it.Note for genre buffs An Alien skull can be seen in the background of the Predator's ship.

It doesn't have Arnie, true but did Arnie really make the first one so great? I don't think so. Gary Busey is in this along with Danny Glover. I do think this movie has its faults but it's so much fun, it's so exciting and adds so much to the Predator universe including the start of the 14 year wait for Alien Vs Predator which ended up not being really worth the wait for. It's all about another Predator who lands near Los Angeles in the middle of a blisteringly hot heatwave. It witnesses a cop played by Danny Glover take on a couple of warring drug gangs which impresses it no end so it decides that Glover is the worthy prey it needs to hunt whilst being hunted itself by a top secret Government organisation lead by Gary Busey.*Slight Spoiler*Predator 2 is full of thrills, excitement, spooky terrifying atmosphere just like the first and gore. The characters are just as deep as the original too. We find out more about the predator too in this. The only thing that maybe irks me a bit is that realistically Danny Glover is nowhere near capable of defeating a predator mainly due to the fact that he is just a cop and he is kind of fat unlike Arnie's character in the first who was an elite commando leader but that can be explained away as luck. Danny Glover is one lucky S.O.B. in this.In Predator 2 we have drug gangs, drug wars, drug lords (gotta love King Willy who says the coolest line ever in movie history), top weapons, action, excitement, tension and of course, a bad ass predator. The effects are great, the acting is good and the music and sound effects in this are pretty much the same from the original so huzzah! You will probably disagree with me but this has a slight edge over Predator 1 and Aliens. It definitely beats the crap out of the rather disappointing Alien Vs Predator. Watch Predator 1 and 2 instead even though if you are a fan of either aliens or predator then nothing and no one will stop you from watching AVP.

Number 1 A predator cant kill a women unless she is armed.

( As seen in the first movie Arny vs predator the same here except the fight travels around the city) Number 3 Predators have been around since the revolutionary war.

Number 4 The final battle will almost always be fought with no weapons until the victor was to finish off his advarsary.Just listed some of the rules so that you don't get confused and think its an error in the script or a directors error.

No way could he take on all those Predators. The symbolism (sorely lacking in most blockbuster action-fests) was great. Of course, the real star of this movie is the Predator. The rest of the cast is uninspired. Glover puts on his best apoplectic intense performance as always. But Maria Alonzo and Paxton seem to phone their lines in. Gary Busey is great as always.

Plain and simple.The original film was fueled purely by testosterone, but it had a good concept (an alien hunting for sport), and was executed pretty beautifully. The action never slowed down for a break, and it was clearly, one of the best action films of the 1980's. Plus, it had Schwarzenneger. And it was in the jungle, where the concept of the predator actually made sense.Whereas in the sequel, he is in futuristic gang/war-ridden Los Angeles (why did it always have to be LA, were there never any other cities that were thought of to become infested with violence years later?). He is still hunting, but as opposed to buffed up marines, he's taking out gang members and city cops.Danny Glover stars in the film as Liutenant Mike Harrigan, who replaces Schwarzenneger's Dutch, as the main protagonist of the film. He is attempting to fight against the gangs, but once this mysterious killer appears on the scene, he attempts to bring him to justice. Of course, he has opposition from a federal agent (Gary Busey), and most of his department, but he still attempts to put the pieces together anyway.I'm not sure if it's just me, but Predator against Danny Glover just really does not sound anywhere near as fun as Predator versus Arnold Schwarzenneger. It seems like they took anything that vaguely made the original film enjoyable, and tried to tone it down a lot. Main adversary went from a pumped up Austrian, to a skinny African-American. The vast jungle went to a big city. It just does not have the same feel, look or enjoyment at all. In fact, it all seems downright ludicrous and silly.Subplots come and go, only vaguely mentioning the original within them. Others are just mentioned, and never gone back to. Supporting characters come and go, never really having a chance to shine (I'm thinking Bill Paxton and Adam Baldwin here, but there were many others who just seemed to have all the fifteen minutes or less of dialogue to use within the film). They attempt to throw in some satire with the whole gang situation, and with the news reports that are oft shown within the film, but the only ones getting the jokes are the filmmakers. And the entire gang element just comes off entirely as over the top. Voodoo rituals? I'm sure they could have found something much more original than that. In fact, removing all of that garbage would have alleviated the running time, which just seems to cry that it is too long for it's own good.As for Predator himself, the effects to bring him to life are just as good as they were before. Sure, in many scenes his camouflage suit looks really terrible, but in others it looks great. When he's not wearing the mask, you can noticeably tell how much more advanced the technology was when the second film came, as opposed to the original. He looks that much different.The film as a sequel just does not work. There's nothing in it that made the original so enjoyable in the first place, which is the cardinal mistake that always seals the fate of a sequel. If this was the original film, then we never would have gotten another one. Now if only they left out the alien skull. Then we never would have had the even worse Alien vs. Predator.4/10.

When scores of drug dealers turn up skinned alive & hanging from the ceiling & others missing their heads, the police are confused & assume that another drug dealer & his gang has come to town to dominate by mowing down their competition. However tough cop Mike Harrigan (DANNY GLOVER) comes to learn that the person held responsible for the vicious slayings, isn't a new player in the drug community at all, but rather a massive & very vicious alien with high tech weaponry & camouflage like abilities, here to hunt all the cities drug lords for sport. When his partner is brutally murdered, Harrigan becomes more determined than ever to take down the creature, but is stopped by D.E.A. agent Keyes (GARY BUSEY) who threatens him to back off. Eventually Harrigan comes to learn that Keyes isn't a member of the D.E.A. but a secret government run organization & seeks to uncover what they are trying to hide from the city police force. PREDATOR 2 is a very rare opportunity in the world of filmdom sequels, it's a film that is not only just as good as the original, but in many ways may even be a much better film than it's predecessor! Many may cry foul over that statement, but I actually wound up enjoying this film much more than the original for a variety of reasons. Not only does the film up the action, stunts & explosions of the first, but also improves on the visual effects, make-up effects & stunts & features more of the Predator than what the original film did & while the film may fail to match the final 45 minutes of the original film, in terms of tension & exciting Mano a Mano showdown between the creature & the hero, for the most part the film tops it in pretty much every department. What is here for the final showdown between the hero & the creature, is still pretty impressive however, as the film-makers do they best they can for the budget they got & the climax is still mighty fun & puts most action/horror/sci-fi climaxes to utter shame. While the film repeats pretty much the same story to an extent, for the most part PREDATOR 2 takes a far more fresher approach by expanding upon the franchises many potential ideas, including a beefed up back story on just what the Predators are, where they come from & why they always comes to earth. There's more suspense, there's more tension & better character development, plus a number of impressive action & horror set pieces. This time the directorial reigns are handed over to A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 5's own STEPHEN HOPKINS, who fares far better here behind the camera than on the otherwise tepid NIGHTMARE 5. He manages to deliver a series of relatively cool shots & keeps the film going at an even pace. There's plenty of gore & stunts on hand, explosions, plus several really cool kills & visual effects to make fans of the first film happy. Much like the first film, the film has many moments of edge of you're seat moments, particularly the action packed opening sequence, the subway train massacre & Glover & The Predator hanging over the edge of a building, while trying to avoid falling to their deaths.The acting works, JOEL SILVER returns as producer & brings along his LETHAL WEAPON co-stars DANNY GLOVER & GARY BUSEY & they both do fine jobs in their roles. Glover may not be no Arnold, but he fares well in his role as a tough cop. Busey shines in his role as a sneaky government operative Peter Keyes, while BILL PAXTON from ALIENS seems to be having fun with his role & the late KEVIN PETER HALL is very impressive as the Predator. The special effects by STAN WINSTON are top notch & better than what they were in the first, including a more detailed Predator suit & make-up.

When various gang members fall victim to the aforementioned predator, an ultra-secret government agency (led by no-nonsense Gary Busey) wrests control of the case from Glover, who becomes personally involved when his partner (Ruben Blades) is torn to pieces by the alien fiend.Glover is a little too old for the kind of macho heroics displayed here, though his commercial profile was on a high at the time, due to his appearance in the hugely successful Lethal Weapon series, and his professional approach to the less-than-stellar screenplay is mirrored by an equally talented supporting cast, including Maria Conchita Alonso, Robert Davi, Adam Baldwin, Calvin Lockhart and a young-looking Bill Paxton as the rookie cop who has a memorable encounter with the title creature on a fast-moving subway train, the movie's pièce de résistance.

Good to see Bill Paxton though, because he of course starred in Terminator and Aliens also. The Predator was a great creation though and if they could get a better story-line and it was better casted Predator 3 would be a welcome return, I don't fancy an Alien v Predator film though, which has been rumoured for about the last decade.

It in no way tarnishes the first Predator film.  The first Predator's victims ranged from South American guerrilla soldiers to American soldiers, now the second Predator's victims range from Columbian and Jamaican drug dealers to street gangs to federal agents.  I think the setting (1997 Los Angeles)of Predator 2 adds to the overall intensity of the film.  The Predator in the first film was old and experienced, the Predator in the second film seems a lot younger, but just as deadly.  What really separates Predator 2 from the first film is the assortment of weapons.  The weapons I think, are the highlight of Predator 2.  My favorite is the flying disc.

Although it wasn't particularly scary, it was fun, exciting and it had Sir. Arnie. So when I rented this out a couple of nights ago I was expecting something similar, fun but chilling (despite Glover). Instead I get a stupid boring piece of garbage! As I expected Glover is awful but everyone in the film gives terrible performances, even Paxton is average after his brilliant performance in Aliens. The script is full of senseless dribble and the racist gangs are so- American stereotypical, drug smoking lunatics. Also I have an unusual quip about the language. I have no problem with swearing in films and sometimes it is sort of essential. In this film they just pack it in, every 5 minutes a person swears!. I'm sorry but this is too much and totally ridiculous and pointless. And then we come to the worst thing about it, The Predator. Arnie's guy was menacing, stealthy and strong at the same time which is helped by the total beat down and laugh scenes at the end of the first film. Also it looks brilliant, just as good as the alien effects. This makes him formidable and certainly not someone you'd want to meet. In this film the predator could have been beaten up by a hard teen. You need the creature to be threatening in a these films for it to work, this weedy thing doesn't help things and coupled with the other terrible parts of this film it turns into a cesspool. The thing that saves this is the interesting ending where we discover some of the culture of the predators. Them rewarding glover with a trophy and the collection of skulls on the spaceship's wall is very insightful and was the only decent thing in this film. All successful sagas (and by that I mean 4-7 films) the sequel needs to be quite good. If this had been better I think we could have seen a lot more predator films but this pile of garbage destroyed a potentially great franchise. "},{"Title":"From Arnie to Danny Glover!?

Lieutenant Michael Harrigan (Danny Glover) & his team, Danny Archuleta (Ruben Blades), Leona Cantrell (Maria Conchita Alonso) & new boy Jerry Lambert (Bill Paxton) are on the front line fighting against the terror these gangs bring to the streets. However there seems to be a new player in town, a new kind of killer loose, a killer without mercy, without motive, without discrimination & one who loves to kill. Harrigan & his team have nothing to go on except a spear head made from a material that is unknown on Earth & the sudden appearance of shadowy FBI figure Peter Keyes (Gary Busey) & his team of men who seem very interested in capturing whoever or whatever is responsible for these brutal killings. It's not long before Harrigan realises that what he is up against is not of this planet, it's the ultimate killing machine, it's the ultimate predator...Directed by Stephen Hopkins I thought Predator 2 was a good solid sci-fi/horror/action film but was not as good as the original Predator (1987) which had the perfect blend of blood, guts, big guns, testosterone, one-liners, action & explosions. I cannot say the same for Predator 2, unfortunately. The script by Jim & John Thomas shifts the action from the jungles of Central America to the urban jungle of Los Angeles which is my first problem, I just thought that the hunter/prey situation worked so much better in the isolated harsh jungle than the sprawling city of Los Angeles. Danny Glover is no Arnold Schwarzenegger in the running around with a big gun blowing things up stakes & they just had to include the clichéd misguided scientist who wants to capture the predator so we can study it. Also, if these FEDS were so clever why did they leave the only piece of information that could lead Harrigan to them & the predator on the computer for that pathologist to find & yet manage to completely delete everything else? Having said that Predator 2 is a good film, it moves along at a nice pace, has one or two decent action scenes & provides solid entertainment.Director Hopkins could have done a better job, for a start just having people randomly fire guns at nothing in particular is neither exciting or original & I actually thought the action scenes lacked a certain spark & seemed a little dull even down to an almost incomprehensible train sequence in which you can barely tell what's happening because it's set amidst flickering lights. Danny Glover looked a bit old & out of shape as well as he tries to do a Mel Gibson in Lethal Weapon (1987), wasn't Glover purposely the old slow one in the Lethal Weapon films? Apparently Predator 2 was cut down to get a lower rating so don't expect buckets of blood or gore, there are some skinned bodies, a decapitated head, someone is cut with a razor wire net, people are impaled on spears & there are plenty of gunshot wounds but there's nothing here overly nasty.Technically Predator 2 is great & has that big budget Hollwood polish to it, the special effects hold up well even today & the predator creature is just plain cool, isn't it? A lot of the original's music is reused here which also seemed out of place & inappropriate at times. Predator 2 has a fine cast which it wastes, Paxton is always watchable, Robert Davi is criminally underused although Conchita Alonso annoyed me with her hairstyle & irritating accent.Predator 2 is a good film of that there is no doubt but I much prefer the original, it's as simple & straight forward as that. Definitely worth a watch though as I think most would enjoy it.

They also wouldn't pay John McTiernan what he wanted, so we got a director of a low budget horror film (Nightmare on Elm Street 5) McTiernan also started with a low budget horror, (Nomads) was the studio hoping for a clone of John McTiernan in Stephen Hopkins?All of the action film elements from the original are gone, so is a lot of the sci-fi angle, the suspense, and anticipation of the Predator, the well written dialogue, and mostly all which remains is an excessively gory, blood- drenched film, dealing largely with voodoo and gang violence in LA, with the Predator taking on only a supporting character role.But in the rousing final act, as Glover finally does battle with the Predator, the film really comes alive, in 30 or so minutes of chasing and fighting; the highlight of the movie. We learn a bit more about the Predator's weapons, which doesn't mar what we found out in the first film.

New weapons were introduced, the Predator stayed true to form and mystery was maintained about it's species. But the execution of it all made for as insulting a treatment of the canon as Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines did to that franchise.I don't know why Hollywood in general feels the need to dumb-down sci-fi in order to attract audiences. There is no need for it in the Predator universe because its a premise we can all understand at our animal level. But they did more than dumb it down here, they made some scenes downright comical and not in the sense of comic books.Science fiction can be made believable with a little more attention paid to the three spatial dimensions and time. In this case, I'm talking about Murtaugh surviving a near-disintegration after having but a handful of seconds to duck behind some small obstruction to shield himself from the engine blast of the Predator spaceship located perhaps thirty yards away.Not everyone is as demanding - or easy - as I am about such things, but once, just once I'd like to see a second installment exceed it's predecessor not unlike Terminator 2 Judgment Day managed to do.

It doesn't have any of the characters from the first movie in it. It's a different film that ties it's action in with previous events. The director John McTiernan and original star Arnold Schwarzenegger turned down the project . Instead we have a relatively unknown director Stephen Hopkins and a star cast &#x96; Danny Glover , Gary Busey , Bill Paxton and Robert Davi. The plot is basically the same (alien versus armed people) , only the setting is different.Predator 2 is a disappointing sequel. The original film had good and original concept , great direction and an action star in main role. This movie has none of that. First problem &#x96; the setting. The concept of predator made sense in jungle . The jungle playground has this time been replaced by a large city (asphalt and concrete jungle , get it ?). This is a VERY bad move, it takes what was so fresh and puts the audience into too well-known territory of slasher movies.Second problem &#x96; the cast . Danny Glover is the main star in Predator 2. Here , Glover gets to play the part of Riggs instead of Murtagh and it's a very odd choice. He gives a decent performance , the best in the movie and has a certain charisma. Still , Glover as the man who could defeat Predator is simply unconvincing. I understand that movie makers wanted someone more like a regular guy this time for audience to root for , but Glover is not tough enough for action star (who was the real star of Lethal weapon &#x96; he or Gibson ?). I would suggest casting Sylvester Stallone , who can be convincing as both tough guy and regular guy at the same time , but that's me.Glover is pretty much alone in this .Schwarzenegger had great support from Carl Weaters , Bill Duke , Shane Black , Jesse Ventura and Sonny Landham . Here Glover gets annoying Maria Conchita Alonso plus Bill Paxton and boring Ruben Blades. Robert Davi appears for less than 5 minutes . Their characters aren't interesting or particularly well played. Only Gary Busey is quite nice as the FBI agent.Third problem &#x96; the story. Predator is just randomly killing people, without really toying with them or any real effort into it. The Predator is barely in the film, as there are huge sections where the Predator is absent, focusing instead on it's boring story. The story is utterly predictable , characters have rather lame dialogues and all in all the story is an excuse for blood splatter with lame characters that die very graphically in many different ways. The movie also seems to try a little bit of satire on future Los Angeles (something in Verhoeven style) , but it ends rather laughably over the top.Fourth problem &#x96; the direction. Hopkins tries to create some horror atmosphere in here , but fails . Even worse are the action scenes that feel very amateurish and are devoted of any spark. Predator 2 has a rather slow pace, fits into the horror more than action and unfortunately unfortunately, is a lot less effective in doing so. It can't settle on one mood , it tries to be both horror and action , but neither is done right. Hopkins is more interested in visual style , and while Predator 2 looks pretty cool is almost completely devoted of any real tension or excitement.The good things ? The movie looks cool. The use of Jamaican gangs seems like a original and cool idea.The music by Alan Silvestri is still good. The gadgets are cool (weapons and the ship). The movie does become fun in third act when FINALLY we get some tension and excitement. There's even some nice humor (I don't think he gives a s**t , alright , who's next). I also liked the Easter eggs (the head and the gun).It's true that Predator was a hard act to follow. However , there was no real need for the sequel to be made. If you can't do something right, don't do it at all. This is obviously MUCH better than those horrible Alien versus Predator movies ,but still a disappointment. I give it 4/10.

However, there's enough non-stop chaos and violence for any action, horror, or sci-fi fan. It's an adequate sequel, but certainly not anything extraordinary. A few new bits of information on the Predator's origin are introduced.The basic plot Rasta alien creature goes to New York to hunt the hunter and feed on bloody carcases. Hunters here refers to gang bangers, and gruesome crime scenes of their remains strewn about puzzle investigators, including the cop hero (Danny Glover). The cop goes on a vigilante pursuit of the creature, and their ultimate mano-a-mano encounter is handled well. Along the way, the movie fulfills its obligatory cliché requirements dumb guy wanders alone where he doesn't belong; government interlopers dressed in black want to cover everything up; and the monster shows how tough it is by destroying the bathroom of some old lady's house.Trying to meld two conflicting themes that don't fit together is a big problem this film doesn't solve. The stark reality of vicious crime lords of the inner city and a malicious fantasy killing machine may each be formidable in their own arena, but mixed together forfeits their believability and consequently any power as antagonists. They become comical caricatures of themselves, in a world that is neither fully real nor fully imaginary. The loss of the charismatic mercenary hero from the original Predator doesn't help much, either. There are superior visuals, like the interior shot that's used in the final sequence. The film never slows down, and something new is always unfolding. Acting is decent, but the script writer gives most characters poor lines and little dimension. Why the alien doesn't exploit its advantages is unclear. And he AGAIN conveniently loses most of his most lethal weapons at just the right moment? Flagrant foul, script writer. Can the renegade cop get rid of the menace, and make the streets of New York once again safe for violent crime? The film is entertaining enough to sit through and find out, but it will help to fast-forward through some of the sillier scenes.

But aside from that Predator 2 does nothing much to stand out as being a good movie. Yes, you do get to see the Predator kill and assassinate multiple victims in the movie for your viewing pleasure, but the producers have given the Predator a bit of a soft side, which just doesn't feel right after its predecessor. There will be those that think the twists that Predator 2 offered from the last Predator are great and make it an excellent sequel, others will be completely letdown by it as they'd expect much more after Predator. Next time you go to Blockbuster and want to watch a gritty urban sci-fi thriller Predator 2 might be worth your time, just don't take it too seriously.

The supporting cast is a who's who of late 80s/early 90s B-listers, but they all do their bit nicely in a film that simmers along at a decent pace. The Predator is a brilliant monster and its a shame that the franchise was tarnished by AVP in 2004, a really lame offering that didn't pack this film's punch. Compared to Predator 1 it's hard to say whether this is better. The films are actually quite different, but both very entertaining.

However, I find the main characters in the movie, although maybe a bit too charicaturish, are doing a good job making you care about them just enough to be interested in their fate.The biggest problem with the plot is that everyone who sees the movie has already seen the first Predator movie. The plot tries to do what the first movie did, make the audience wonder what this creature is. But we all already know what the guy is, so that part of the plot misses the audience.The rest of the plot mostly works though, and we do get to learn a bit more about these ruthless killers.I give this one 6.5/10. A bit above average.I've read several other comments about this movie, and I feel I need to clear up some misconceptions**** SPOILERS ***** The Predators does NOT speak English. They replay parts of recorded sound. And being intelligent creatures having spent centuries on earth, they're able to put these recorded bits and pieces into context and replay them at an appropriate moment.The predator did NOT see HEAT from the light sources. He scanned different frequency bands until he saw some other emission reflected from the dust in the air.The other predators did not help out their friend, because it was his battle. The predators hunt to show their manhood. Getting help from the others would probably mean lost honor, or some such.The ship was not in the basement of the building. It was below, in some abandoned tunnel or cave or something. How it got there in the first place, yes I agree that's a bit strange.Yes, the elevator would not crush anyone underneath. But hanging below one closing in on the ground may cause a momentary laps of reason. I think the main character is not the only one who would struggle thinking clearly in that situation.

Throughout the movie we see a powerful being whimsically hunt down and kill humans, strip and possibly skin them, hang them upside down, take from the carcass and eat what it wants and then display the spinal column and skull in a trophy case.  We sit in awe of the creature's power over us, hoping that it is alone, gets board and leaves us alone.  Fortunately we are able to kill the superior foe as sometimes happens, but it is the setting of the final scenes where the movie makes its real statement.  These scenes take place in a meat packing plant where we see skinned frozen sides of beef hung up waiting for consumption by us.  The true horror of this movie is that we know the terror of the alien is really a representation of us.  Nothing the alien has done is as horrible as what we do to cows (and so many other animals). The alien's actions towards us are an obvious comparison to the practices of the industrialized slaughterhouse and the processing of cows into hamburgers.  Each member of the audience knows in a deep way that mercy is not to be expected if the aliens actions are anything like ours.  Instead we ourselves will soon be easily subjected and horribly processed according the aliens desires.  I think that this movie can create some thought around the idea that the fear and terror we bring to our fellow creatures not only hurts them but is hurting us also.  While most people are so disassociated from their role in the practices of horror that take place on the planet that they don't even notice the hanging carcasses of fellow creatures who we have mistreated (the cows), the pain we are creating is working its way out in this film, and in society.

It's an interesting idea done well with good special effects.

Transferring the alien from the jungles of Central America to the urban jungle sounded really interesting.  But the film turns out to be just a loud and incompetently made action movie.What is an action film?  Is it simply scenes of people shooting at each other and running around while explosions go off?  Or is there something more to it than that?  Pred 2 shows no cognizance of how to put action on screen.  Static scenes of people shooting at each other do not an action film make.  The film's opening is a good example of this.  The police are having a shoot-out with some gang members.  We see 1) shot of the cops standing towards the right of the screen shooting towards the left; 2) Cut to shot of the gangsters standing towards the left of the screen shooting towards the right; 3) Cut to shot of the cops standing towards the right of the screen... and so on.  Meanwhile, between these groups is a policeman who is lying on the ground and whom the gang members apparently want to kill.  Why don't they just shoot him?  You get the feeling that the reason is because the gang members are never in the same camera angle as he is.  This is simply BAD DIRECTION and it is displayed throughout the film. Danny Glover is a good actor and has appeared in action movies before, but he is not believable here with all the physical derring do required of his character.  Gary Busey, looking very pudgy, has a rather foolish role as a government agent out hunting predators.Most sequels aren't as good as the original and, in my opinion, Predator 2 doesn't even come close to the film that preceded it.

Due to how the original film is well received (whether in popularity or in box office) and because of this has a lot of hype surrounding it, the sequel has a lot of weight to carry on it's shoulders, and because of this, is very disappointing when they often don't deliver. Sure, there are some exceptions here and there, but often movie sequels are often regarded unfavorably as they usually can't live up to the hype. This is definitely one of the prime examples of that. A bad story, bland characters, a lack of threat from the main villain and more helps this to become one of the worst sequels ever made, and makes the first film look like Citizen Kane in comparison.The story is that a decade after the original film, the Predator is on another hunting season, this time in a gang controlled Los Angeles, with many being killed off in the process. However, when a cop is murdered, his friend Lieutenant Mike Harrigan starts investigating trying to find his killer. Along the way he will have to deal with menacing drug kingpins and corrupt federal agents. The plot is one of the major problems of the film. Not only does it move at a significantly slower pace than the first film, but many of the multiple sub-plots it tries to establish (i.e. the corrupt federal agent, how his right-wing attitude towards certain crimes is being investigated) aren't interesting and often go nowhere, due to how either the characters in these sub-plots are killed off or how they are swiftly forgotten about after only a few scenes. It is hard to get invested in anything in the movie due to how not only is the plot very boring, but the characters are (with the exception of the main character) either very bland (e.g. Gary Busey's federal agent, the police captain) or pointless (e.g. Mike's female co-worker, Bill Paxton's comic relief sidekick who is clearly meant to be this film's version of Shane Black's Hawkins from the original). Not only that but by the end of the film, there are many loose ends that it doesn't tie or characters whose fates aren't revealed, and because of that you are left with a lot more questions than answers. That leads me to the biggest problem with the film the Predator itself. Don't get me wrong, he is one of the best aliens ever put on film, and the first film did a very good job of establishing this, warts and all. However, this film doesn't do the creature justice at all, as the near-invincible hunter from the first film is reduced to little more than cannon fodder. Sure, Aliens did the same thing, but at least in that movie, the aliens were still hard to kill cannon fodder, (SPOLIER) to the point where most of the marine characters die because of it. Here, the Predator (SPOLIER) is killed by a average-built cop, quite easily I should add. This makes the Predator much less of a threat than he was in the first film. Sure in the first film (SPOILER) he is killed off, but Arnie barely managed to survive against him and it was by bare luck that he managed to triumph. It was also a fairer match in the first film as well, considering that Arnie was an experienced soldier with a bodybuilder frame, and it was more plausible how Arnie managed to succeed in that film because of it. Considering how Danny Glover's character is not only less well built than Arnie but is also a cop should have made the fight more challenging, however the fact that wins so easily reduces any sort of menace that the Predator had in the first film. It doesn't help that the Predator is barely in the film, as there are huge sections where the Predator is absent, focusing instead on it's boring story. This amount of restraint would be excusable if this were the first film in a franchise, but not in the sequel where we expect to see more of the main antagonist. This is worsened however when he does show up to kill, as it's a major disappointment, as his killing sprees are either not shown or shot quite badly, especially during his subway massacre where it's shot so dark, it's hard to see what's going on. Considering how the first film's writers and subsequent creators of the franchise are on board once again, it's baffling that they've reduced their creature's coolness and menace by not only giving him less screen time and making him less of a threat this time round. Amazing. The film also suffers from political problems as well. The film is very right wing, as it supports it's hero despite his Michael Winner- esque actions (e.g. disobeying orders, attacking federal agents) and is slightly racist as well, portraying all of its Jamaican characters as drug dealers which is made worse due to the way they speak and act. It's quite surprising no-one on production noticed this, and because of this, it's politics are very questionable at best and flat out disgusting at worst.All of these problems make Predator 2 one of the worst sequels ever made. From it's poor storytelling, weak character development, terrible use of the Predator to its alarming politics, Predator 2 is a film that should be avoided like the plague, for not only being terrible on its own but a terrible sequel to a brilliant film. Sure the original is problematic, but the sequel is perfunctory in the extreme. Watch the original, as you'll get more from it than you will from this trash. Avoid at all costs.

As much as I wanted to care about the characters here, I just didn't it. The cast had potential, come on, Danny Glover and Bill Paxton. The atmosphere set up right from the beginning is not a terrifying and somewhat subtle one, as in the last film, but an overly loud, drug, sex, gang and voodoo ( wtf?) filled sloppy mess. It was like watching the film Do the Right Thing (which is a good film by the way) on crack and with a predator thrown in the mix. In all fairness, the climax was somewhat cool and I enjoyed it but it just wasn't that involving. What a shame.

This sequel is below the standard that the 1987 film set. The direction is good but not extraordinary. The director Stephen Hopkins (A Nightmare On Elm Street 5, The Ghost And The Darkness, Blown Away) handles his crew well and does the most with the script and budget allotted to the film.Now here's the problem. The HORRIBLE CASTING. I was offended. No ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER??? And who the hell was DANNY GLOVER in 1990? Nothing. This film propelled him to stardom because he stole the role of Arnold. This film is not meant to be a comedy so why cast Bill Paxton??? Also not to mention that Gary Busey(Hider In The House) looks awkward.The rest of the bunch of nitwit supporting cast don't deserve mention except the minute role played by Robert Davi. Poor guy had only a few lines to say in the film.Now the special effects. This is what SAVED THE FILM FROM FLOPDOM. We seen the new weapons wielded by the predator a net is used and a spear and lastly a sort of discus which returns after killing its intended target. Also multiple points of view of the predator is seen. Taking of trophies is the same as with the first film.The plot Los Angeles a turf war between heavily-armed Colombian and Jamaican drug cartels. A Predator observes a shootout between the police and Colombians, watching as Lieutenant Michael Harrigan (Danny Glover) charges into the firefight to rescue two wounded officers and drives the Colombians back into their hideout. Before the police can pursue them, the Predator crashes through a skylight and kills the Colombians using its advanced weaponry. Harrigan and his detectives Leona Cantrell (María Conchita Alonso) and Danny Archuleta (Rubén Blades) enter the building against orders and find the Colombians slaughtered. Harrigan pursues their leader to the roof and shoots him, catching a glimpse of the camouflaged Predator's silhouette but dismissing it as an effect of the heat. Harrigan is rebuked by his superiors for defying orders and is introduced to Special Agent Peter Keyes (Gary Busey), leader of a federal task force purportedly investigating the cartels, and Detective Jerry Lambert (Bill Paxton), the newest member of Harrigan's team.The Predator next kills several Jamaican cartel members who are in the act of murdering the Colombian drug lord. Despite being ordered to wait for Keyes, Harrigan and his team enter the penthouse apartment where they find the Jamaicans' skinned corpses suspended from the rafters. Keyes expels Harrigan's team from the scene, but Danny returns later to investigate further. He retrieves one of the Predator's speartip weapons from an air conditioning vent, but is killed by the Predator. Harrigan vows to bring down Danny's killer, believing that the perpetrator is an assassin involved in the drug war. A forensic scientist determines that the speartip weapon does not correspond to any element on the periodic table. Harrigan meets with Jamaican drug lord King Willie (Calvin Lockhart), a voodoo practitioner who tells him that the killer is supernatural in nature. After Harrigan leaves, the Predator kills King Willie.Cantrell and Lambert are intervening in a mugging on the subway when the Predator attacks them. Cantrell herds the passengers to safety while Lambert faces off against the Predator and is killed. The Predator is about to kill Cantrell as well, but releases her when its thermal vision reveals that she is pregnant. Harrigan pursues the Predator but is accosted by Keyes, who reveals that the killer is an extraterrestrial hunter that sees in infrared, uses active camouflage, and has been hunting humans for sport around the world. Keyes and his team have set a trap for it in a nearby slaughterhouse, using thermally insulated suits and cryogenic weapons in an attempt to capture it for study. However, the Predator sees through the trap by using its mask to scan through various electromagnetic wavelengths and kills the team. Harrigan intervenes, shooting the Predator several times and removing its mask.Still alive, the Predator kills Keyes using a bladed throwing disc and escapes to the roof. Harrigan knocks it over the side and finds himself on a narrow ledge with the Predator hanging below. The Predator attempts to activate the self-destruct device on its forearm, but Harrigan uses the throwing disc to sever its forearm and destroy the device. The Predator falls through an apartment window and uses a medical kit to treat its wounds, then flees through the building. Harrigan follows it down an elevator shaft and finds its spacecraft in an underground chamber. Inside the ship the two face off in a final duel, with Harrigan finally killing the Predator by impaling it in the chest with its own throwing disc. A number of other Predators appear, collecting their dead comrade and presenting Harrigan with an antique flintlock pistol labeled Raphael Adolini 1715. Harrigan escapes the ship as it takes off and reaches the surface just as the remainder of Keyes' team arrives, furious that they were unable to capture the alien. Contemplating the pistol, Harrigan speculates that the creatures will eventually return.Overall 6/10. Add to your DVD Collection because of the Special Effects.

It shrewdly cashes in on white audiences' fear of urban blacks by making all of the earthly villains non-white, and by giving the alien predator himself dreadlocks (director Stephen Hopkins grew up in Jamaica). Throughout the film, the creature is linked to ethnic minorities. He's a barbaric outsider, disrupting society and causing crime for no apparent reason.To disguise the racial message, the film's hero is made a black cop (Danny Glover), but it's symbolically significant that in his moment of triumph he becomes covered in dust and literally turns white. Predator 1 was pretty stupid, but the final half hour was great, featuring an epic battle between Aryan superman and alien beast. In that film, Arnie covered himself in mud, becoming the black savage to defeat his enemy. Here, Danny Glover becomes white, fighting first in white frost and then whilst covered in powder.Ignoring the strange, racist overtones, the film is still far better than the Alien vs Predator movies. It has a couple memorable action scenes and a nice ambiance. This kind of big budget, R rated, non-PC movie wouldn't get made today.In the early 90s, action movies were handled with a lot of care. Here, the cinematography and set designs are all juicy, with every frame oozing atmosphere, texture and nice little touches. A lot of technical talent worked behind this film, so on a visceral level it looks, sounds and feels great. But such things can't overcome the huge flaws. The film is racist, needlessly violent, foul mouthed, stupid, devoid of genuine tension and imagination. The direction is workmanlike, rather than artistic and yet....that iconic final scene leaves such a great impression.Predator 1- 8/10 - worth watching for the brilliant final half hour.Predator 2- 7.5/10 - worth watching for the ever lovable Bill Paxton.

Likewise, Kershner couldn't stoop to Verhoeven's level to make a Robo' sequel.  As it turns out, Verhoeven should have made this movie and left Total Recall to Cronenberg.With Predator 2, I am not surprised that Stephen Hopkins is a television director, the movie is very TV in visual layout.  How ironic that both he and Renny Harlin come from the Nightmare on Elm Street style of film, can you consider it any good if they are following after Wes Craven?Overall, this movie succeeded in killing the series.  The Predator films always came second to the Alien films, but this isn't even half of Alien Resurrection.  Couldn't some competence have been hired first?

Who else but seven times Mr. Olympia title winner Arnie could feasibly take on a huge 7ft tall extraterrestrial hunter and emerge victorious?Apart from Danny Glover, of course. That's right, 'I'm too old for this s**t' Murtaugh, Mad Mel's ageing sidekick from Lethal Weapon.Amazingly, that is who is pitted against the ugly alien trophy hunter in Predator 2; and yet somehow, despite this unusual casting choice, this sequel still manages to be extremely entertaining stuff, largely thanks to a no-holds barred approach by director Stephen Hopkins, who packs his film with explosive, non-stop action set-pieces and a large helping of gruesome gore.Set in the very near future (1997), the film sees an alien hunting humans in the urban jungle of Los Angeles, focusing its attention on the city's Colombian and Jamaican gang members, who are involved in a territorial war. When Lieutenant Mike Harrigan (Glover) leads an investigation into the mysterious deaths of several Colombians, he not only comes between the hunter and his prey, but also upsets a shady government plan to capture the creature in order to study its advanced technology.Although this plot might not be as lean as the original's, it does offer an exciting new arena for the action, plus a variety of colourful characters for the predator to kill and display in his trophy cabinet there's the despicable Colombian and Jamaican gang members, of course, all of whom are larger-than-life caricatures well deserving of the nasty deaths that they receive; then there are Harrigan's doomed police buddies, Danny (Rubén Blades) and Jerry (Bill Paxton) whose deaths serve to give our hero a good reason to risk life and limb for revenge; and last, but definitely not least, we have the brilliant Gary Busey as federal agent Peter Keyes, who has 'dead' written all over him from the start.Inevitably, the action all boils down to a prolonged fight between Harrigan and the skull-plucking, spine-ripping alien, with the brave cop eventually tracking the monster to its spaceship for a final showdown. It's at this point that Glover feels most miscast in his role if Arnie's highly trained, muscle-bound special forces commando Dutch barely survived his close encounter, what chance would an LA street cop have? This minor quibble aside, however, Predator 2 still provides the spills and thrills I demanded, throws in some rather cool touches along the way (xenomorph skull, anyone?), and is generally a much better movie than many would have you believe.

He doesn't go around killing everyone he can, he picks choice kills and hunts them. Why did he kill all those people in the subway? Who knows? He didn't even take trophies of them. The scene with Keys when he tries to capture the predator is totally predictable, woo, i wonder whats gonna happen. Maybe his whole team will get killed by the predator. Hmm, its a real toughy. Then we get the predator running into some apartment, crushing some wall tiles, and making some kind of healing substance. Is there something i dont know about wall tiles? or have they always had medicinal properties? Maybe its a pred thing. Then comes the ending scene, which totally baffled me. Danny Glover survives a fall down a elevator shaft, and ends up in a predator ship that somehow got into a underground tunnel. Well, how in the hell did the predators manage to get a ship into a tunnel in the middle of a city with no one noticing? Anyways, danny starts beating up a predator which has killed about 50 people through the movie with ease, but some how now has trouble killing danny, whose gotten his butt kicked throughout the  entire movie. Well *surprisingly* danny glover kills the predator, when all of a sudden.. a bunch of other predators appear. They seem to have no problem with the fact that one of their buddies just died, because they dont do squat to him, besides giving him some old gun, which makes no sense at all. What does this old gun symbolize? I have no idea. Well danny decides its time to leave, so he jumps out, and we have almost the exact same ending as predator, only in a city setting. Everything in this movie is pretty bad. The predator couldnt hold a stick up to the one in the original, he just doesnt have the same amount of skill. The jamacian drug lords are laughable stereotypes, pot smoking, rastafarian, pimps with uzis. Danny Glover is the typical cop who cant stay out of trouble, with his rag tag posse of cops who all manage to get killed. I want to know why in every sci fi movie, they always have to have some scientist who wants to try and capture or make peace with some monster who has killed countless numbers of people. I have to agree with the person who was talking about danny glovers pants. They are freakin hilarious. At least 2 sizes too  big and drooping all over. Everything in this movie stinks. Dont see it.

Filled with great direction,brilliant Action,score and fantastic special make-up effects,Predator 2 is not only an excellent classic and not only one of my favorite Action movies,but one of my favorite movies period.Set in Los Angeles,California in 1997,ten years after the first film,Predator 2 tells the story of a futuristic Los Angeles where on the streets L.A cops are battling drug dealing Jamacians and Colombians for control of the streets. When a new Predator comes into the city and starts hunting and killing off Jamacians,Colombians and then cops,maverick tough cop Mike Harrigan(Danny Glover)wants to get the Predator who's in town with a few days to kill.I can not understand for the life of me why Predator 2 has such a mixed reputation with most Predator fans. There's a lot very silly reasons for the mixed reputation,Arnold wasn't in it,Danny Glover was wrong for the role and miscast,The City setting was wrong. Even in 2010 when Predators came out some were even saying that Predators was better than Predator 2. In my opinion all of those reasons are terrible and wrong and while Predators was a good movie in it's own right it is not better than Predator 2. One of the reasons I love Predator 2 is because of the futuristic urban setting in Los Angeles and that right from the beginning it gives us viewers a dark future in 1997 where violence and drugs rule the streets and people are living in a record 110 degree hot weather and where there's no rules. The city of Los Angeles is not a pretty place in 1997 and The Predator picked the right place and right time to hunt big game. What I also love about P2 is that while this film is a sequel to the original,P2 works and becomes it's own film and doesn't try to repeat the same things as the original which I think is a creative and bold move by the filmmakers. P2 is also a great sequel because it expands the universe of the Predator franchise and gives fans surprises and shocks. If the first film was a combination of Rambo and Alien,then P2 is a combination of Lethal Weapon and Alien giving viewers a thrilling and fantastic cop story and becoming it's own film with new characters giving viewers a wonderful Film-Noir detective story with the main characters trying to figure who's doing the killings and why. The main characters like Mike Harrigan,the other cops and the other characters in this film are different from the first which I think is a great thing. If the characters in the first film were strong commandos with huge muscles,the cops in P2 are regular looking people which I think makes the characters look more vulnerable and gives the film a sense of danger especially with the main character Mike Harrigan. Mike Harrigan is a great character who's tough and can fight and is different from Dutch from the first film because when you look at Dutch against the Predator you think he could survive,but with Harrigan you ask will Harrigan survive fighting the Predator? This Predator is a different Predator from the first one. Where as the Predator in the first one was much older and more mature,this Predator is younger and more reckless not hiding all the time and using the city of Los Angeles as his own playground hunting down drug dealers and cops not playing by the rules. The Action scenes in the film are great and are definitely up there with the first film because like the first film's Action there's a build up and intensity and when the Action comes it kicks you in the stomach. The ending of the film is great and lasts about 45 minutes and there isn't a wasted moment. The ending is fast-paced and is an amazing mixture of Action and Suspense. A great ending.The whole cast does great jobs in their roles. Danny Glover gives an excellent performance as tough cop Lieutenant Mike Harrigan,with Glover bringing toughness and intensity to the performance. And as for some of the fans who said that Glover wasn't right for the role and was miscast they're wrong,Glover was amazing. Kevin Peter Hall is brilliant in his performance as The Predator,giving us the same body language and subtle movements as in the first film. R.I.P Mr. Hall. Gary Busey is amazing as Peter Keyes,an agent who's been after The Predator for years. Ruben Blades does a great job as Danny,Harrigan's partner and friend. Maria Conchita Alonzo gives a great performance as Leona,a tough female cop. Bill Paxton is wonderful and funny in his performance as the new cop Jerry. Adam Baldwin does a good job as Garber,Keyes' right hand man. Calvin Lockhart is creepy and memorable as King Willie,a Jamacian drug lord. Mortan Downey is hilarious as Tony Pope a news reporter. Robert Davi(Captain Heinemann),Kent McCord(Captain Pilgrim)and Henry Kingi(Scorpio)give good performances as well. The direction by Stephen Hopkins is excellent,with Hopkins bringing a dark,Gothic visually stunning atmosphere to the film and using great camera movements. Hopkins also does a great job with the Action scenes and does the Action like it was easy. Great job,Hopkins.The score by Alan Silvestri is brilliant and intense and fits the dark tone of the film and matches the first film's soundtrack. Great score. There's also a few great rap songs from Papa Dee that go with the film.The special make-up effects by Stan Winston is amazing once again and while The Predator is different,the make-up remains the same and is amazing. R.I.P Stan Winston.In final word,if you love the first Predator,Action films or Sci-Fi films I highly suggest you see Predator 2,an excellent,underrated Action classic and brilliant sequel that deserves a second chance.

It's almost as if they are making a joke of the demographic that currently exists here.I would avoid this and just watch the original Predator. This is a waste of time!

Predator","Date":"27 March 2009","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" Transplanted from one jungle to another, Predator 2 finds our favorite alien with a fetish for gun-play hunting the streets of Los Angeles, during an intense heat-wave and an escalating gang war. Danny Glover (of Lethal Weapon fame) plays the Lieutenant bound to break all the rules and get down the bottom of a string of mysterious deaths that leave its victims skinless. Dealing with a cocky new cop (Bill Paxton) and a mysterious government official (Gary Busey) bound and determined to undermine his authority, our flawed hero finds that gang violence is a cake-walk compared to what intergalactic game hunters have in store for his city.Directed by Stephen Hopkins (A Nightmare on Elm Street 5 The Dream Child) and written by Jim & John Thomas (the men who brought the first Predator to life), Predator 2 is a much different beast than its predecessor. Hopkins, who got his start in horror (and it shows) is much more interested in setting up the mood and a few stalk sequences than he is on mind-numbing action. In stark contrast to the original, this one has a much slower pace, fits into the horror genre a little neater, and, unfortunately, is a lot less efficient in doing so. The biggest problem with the movie is that it can't settle on one mood. At times it feels like a b-movie, or a tacky horror/monster movie. On the other hand, it attempts (and fails) at some social commentary, dating itself in the process. What results in the end is a nice-looking film without much below the surface. I suppose it didn't require much effort to write something as lean and mean as the first, but it's remarkable at how unremarkable the story of Predator 2 is. Aside from some more elaboration on The Predator itself (which may or may not be a good thing) there is hardly anything worth writing home about. You might enjoy the shocking death scenes, the bizarre weapons that The Predator and the cops shoot each other with, and Heck, if you haven't subjected yourself to the Alien Vs. Predator flicks yet, you might appreciate a subtle nod to that other alien franchise. It earns points for its solid cast, with Glover and Busey playing themselves while a fresh-faced Paxton hams it up. Otherwise, what we have here is a typical, moderately enjoyable, but utterly forgettable and inferior sequel. All the more credit to the makers of the film for trying something different than the first. No doubt, the built-in fan-base and the genre crowd that it attracts will find things to appreciate, but for everyone else, Predator 2 is the equivalent of cinematic junk-food.

Bill Paxton is the worst of these, trying to be a mixture of Hudson and Hawkins, and failing so embarrassingly that i only stopped cringing when the predator skewered him during that epileptic train scene.the sets are pretty tacky and contrived, however, more a surreal dumbed down OTT characterisation of LA then the real thing, as epitomised by the skunk-mobile king Willy's boys drive around, blazing a trail to Willy so hungover Harrigan can shudder at Willy's demon babble. then the funky rasta gets decapitated in a pretty cool face off, before the train scene. Busey and his cutout fed boys keep flitting in and out of the picture, ineptly arriving late to every butchering in their plastic helicopter and pissing Harrigan off. eventually, Harrigan's team decimated after a few encounters, the knocked up sassy and annoyingly accented crew-cut Leona spared, Keyes' fed team and Harrigan converge on the slaughterhouse, where the predator has been nailed on one of his feeding times - like the first film, the predator is worked out in order to be beatable. instead of enhancing the mystery the original otherwise promotes with some unexpected twists, it turns out to be little more then a strong, ugly dude with cool toys to kill the other boys, and a clockwork schedule that even the sheer idiots that populate this film can work out. all the same, it takes out the feds and Keyes pretty swiftly and scares the shizam out of hysterical Harrigan, which leads to a tag chase around a few buildings and finally though an elevator shaft to the predator ship.notice my skillful swear word dodging. sarcastically, of course, but for a reason; this is exactly what the film didn't do, instead indulging in character decisions and dialogue that makes British televisual 'drama' Eastenders look erudite, insightful and metaphorically rich. the predator is not expanded on either, because everyone, from the gangs to the press to the police to Keyes and his feds are complete idiots, and each fight with the predator reveals something new in the most patronisingly presentable way - oh look! it spares the pregnant. oh look! it has a net and a spear and a blade gun. oh look! it can see in every spectrum of light, as helpfully demonstrated by Keyes assuming it can't. very clumsily done and shamelessly tacky and plastic, much like everything else about the film; and a great shame, as there were good aspects to it and given a revamp in style, setting, dialogue, plot, score, cinematography - well, everything, it could have been challenging and a worthy sequel.let's not forget how similar the plot is to the original, and how it tries too hard to emulate everything the original does naturally and fails as a result; let's concentrate for a moment on the saving grace of the film, the final battle. the ship is interesting in design, and the gun given back and the revelation that they visit often and are many are tantalisingly revealed and enjoyably observed. Glover still seemingly has that pesky hernia at the end as his drags himself out of the tunnel to confront the cardboard cutout fed who tsks and frets because that nasty but usable alien got away. still, as Harrigan looks up and remarks 'you'll get another chance' the viewer eagerly enjoys an ending that slightly makes up for the rest of the generic 90's action movie mess, and offers the hope for superior, imaginative, exciting sequels to come.well, after 2 separate and unfortunately equally horrific match-ups against the aliens, a bunch of comics that pitted the predator against all manner of characters from Tarzan to Superman, a bunch of games and enough rumours to crash the internet, we're still waiting.OK pussyface, it's your move.

If movies or art had to make sense it would blow the suspension of disbelief, wherein lies all the magic, man. All that said, some of the fun of movies is in second guessing the writer or director in his goals for the work. I don't get the motivation of the Predator(s). If they are such great hunters why do they pick on such an inferior race as humans? Where's the challenge in wasting Barney Fife? Their technology is superior and they are really ugly, which has been a classic monster stereotype for many years.

The plot includes Jamaiican drug lords, subway thugs, and a military interest in the Predator warrior's weapons technology. Director Stephan Hopkins(A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET V) essentially directs this PREDATOR film like a Die Hard/Lethal Weapon with an alien warrior the enemy instead of drug pushers or weapons dealers. Danny Glover is pretty much Murtaugh from LETHAL WEAPON without the family or Mel Gibson, only thing missing is I'm getting too old for this sh#t. You know, though, I kind of like the idea of a hardened, seasoned narcotics cop as the Predator's opposition, instead of the usual titan of muscle, some trained assassin, or a soldier of fortune. The problem I personally had with this film is the murky and dark moments where we can not see any of the violence or action, such as the awful strobe lights subway massacre as the Predator causes mayhem and death towards civilians and punks on board(or the meat packing factory towards the end when Busey and his para-military men seek to freeze the Predator with liquid nitrogen, as to seize and study it). Bill Paxton has a really obnoxious cop character quite similar to dorky roles like in WEIRD SCIENCE before stepping to the plate for more complex dramatic roles as he matured as an actor. Robert Davi is wasted in a minor part as Glover's superior, warning him to tone down his John Wayne routine. Ruben Blades and Maria Conchita Alonzo have supporting parts as members of Glover's team, soon, like Paxton, coming in contact with the Predator. The trophy room(which houses the memorable skull of an alien xenomorph) and cauterized wound sequence(where the Predator has to repair a wound due to Glover severing its arm which contained the auto destruct device) are two of my favorite moments in the film. Hopkins has some very impressive virtuoso camera movements such as when Glover is on a ledge as the Predator holds on to his arm or following a chase from the street to the tops of buildings, eventually leading into an elevator shaft, finally ending with the duel between cop and alien inside the creature's ship. I loved how Glover uses the Predator's own weapon against it, the circular blade which resembles a type of boomerang.

But lets be honest, this movie is not bad at all, especially not when compared to other similar genre attempts.Still they did plenty wrong with this movie and made some serious bad steps. First of all; its settings. The jungle playground has this time been replaced by a large city. Yes, I get it, the city is often regarded as an asphalt and concrete jungle but that is just a figure of speech, no need to take it as literally as they did in this movie. Its settings already take so much away from its concept, that still made the first movie such a strong one.But also the hunting game of the Predator himself seems to have changed this time. Yes, this in itself is also partly due to the fact that it's being set in Los Angeles, that of course is being inhabited by millions of people. How can you effectively play an hunting game in it? No matter were you go, there are always people, so it's easy to kill. And that also seems what the Predator is doing in this movie; he just randomly kills people, without really toying with them first, or put any real effort into it. This takes away so much of the tension already and is part of the reason why this movie really isn't half as effective as the first movie.But what perhaps even more troubled me was that the roles were more or less reversed this time. The main character is after the Predator, instead of the other way around. As a matter of fact, the predator doesn't even seem aware of the Danny Glover character, until half way through or so. Because of this the movie for large part is lacking a real sense of danger, which again, takes away so much of the movie its tension.Another mistake they made was that they showed the Predator way too early on. He's in the first few minutes of the movie and gets fully shown, pretty much right away. The Predator is supposed to be a, literally, invisible hunter, who strikes out of nowhere. No need to show him all the time, in order to make him a scary killer and monster. They really wanted to show off way too much with the Predator this time and all of his cool new weapons.Typical sequel stuff. It tries to desperately to be bigger and better than the first movie, while it's actually involving a totally different cast and crew this time, which already makes this feel like a totally different movie from the first one. I'm not saying that John McTiernan (the director of the first movie) is a brilliant director but his touch was perfect for Predator, while Stephen Hopkins is a director who has basically never surpassed the level of average, with any of his movies.But that's all the negative stuff. The movie still has plenty of redeeming qualities in it. The story is quite weak but at least it's entertaining and ensures that the movie never becomes a boring one. There is plenty happening and the movie also has some amusing and good characters in it, played by some fine actors. Yes, Danny Glover, Gary Busey, Bill Paxton and Robert Davi all play some very typical roles for them but that's simply what they are good at and is why their characters work out and become entertaining ones. And like I said before; just compare this movie to any other genre attempt and you have to conclude that this movie is simply a good and enjoyable movie for what is is.7/10 http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"I have a soft spot in my heart for this sequel.

What it does give us however, are exciting shootouts, some exciting suspense, great chase scenes, and I might get flamed for this, but a great, and charismatic lead in Danny Glover. Aside from the ugly outfits he wore, he really pulled his performance off beautifully. It has some great secondary characters as well. I also enjoyed the mind-games played by The Predator in the subway scene. How he just stalks the people, especially Paxton's. Its goofy nature served the movie well, and for what it was, I highly enjoyed it. The first was a master at creating tension, suspense, and balancing it all perfectly with action. This one is more the action route, but it doesn't mean it's not good. I just think people were disappointed, Arnie didn't reprise his role, the setting obviously threw them off, and they didn't like Glover's performance. The finale was a bit too neat for me though, it didn't feel that realistic. Am I really supposed to believe, they would let him off that easy, just because he was valiant and courageous in his efforts to fight them? The gun from early times was a nice touch though. No, it's not perfect, but it is underrated entertainment. Yes it's a failure, but an entertaining one. Hey, at least it's not like the Alien Vs Predator Movies! Performances. Danny Glover gets lambasted like no other for his performance here, but I thought he was fantastic. His intensity knows no bounds, and his sense of humor benefited the film the greatly. Some say, he basically brought his Lethal Weapon stuff here, but I disagree. He has traits of the Murtaugh character, yes, but he is clearly darker in his approach. He was a likable hero, and I thought he followed up Arnie very well. Gary Busey plays crazy like no other, and he was a treat to watch, when on-screen. Maria Conchita Alonso Acts with her accent, and was utterly terrible in my mind. Miscast is an understatement. Bill Paxton always plays a great sleaze-ball, here is no different. (It's my specialty!) Morton Downey Jr. is annoying, he did his job, I'll say that.Bottom line. Far from perfect, but it's certainly entertaining in my books. It has plenty of pro's that outweigh the cons in my mind. Take it for what it is. A less intelligent venture into the real world, turned into a full-blown action picture. Hopefully you'll see my point.

Although there are more things learned about the monstrous Predator species in the sequel, there are so many downsides that disappointed me, and many unnecessary additions to the Predator saga.The story takes place in 1997 in Los Angeles, where the once-starry-eyed city is now a zone of local gang warfare. Amidst the gang wars, something is causing brutal killings in various parts of LA. A tough detective (Danny Glover) sets out to see who is behind these gruesome murders, while a secret agent (Gary Busey) has his own plans for the mysterious killer...The main problem with this film is that it's less realistic than the first one. I wouldn't believe that Los Angeles would be so dark & dank in 1997. The police couldn't have been weaker than the ridiculous gangs in the city. And furthermore, Danny Glover doesn't look tough enough to face the Predator (he should have stayed in the Lethal Weapon films). All these points are an insult to fans of the first film.Another problem is the fact that Xenomorphs (from the film Aliens) were actually linked to the Predators. In the film, a Xenomorph skull was shown in the Predator's trophy room in its spacecraft, which means that Predators have hunted the creatures before. If the stupid film-makers didn't put that damn Alien skull in the movie, the link between Aliens and Predators wouldn't have existed. Furthermore, there wouldn't be any trashy sci-fi films and video games that linked the two franchises together (such as the film AVP and the Aliens vs. Predator video games). Sadly, this link has been established and nothing can be done about it.Finally, the Predator in this film was extremely weak. Unlike the frighteningly powerful Predator in the original film, this Predator is pretty much a novice. It actually gets beaten by a puny little police officer. Its attempts at scaring audiences are absent, as this Predator spouts ridiculous one-liners. Its makeup effects look terribly fake when compared to the first movie; it looked more funny than scary. Worst of all, it is hard to believe that this naive Predator would hunt in a city. Who cares if the weather is hot there?! Would a Predator go hunt in the Sahara desert then? NO! There ARE a few good things about this movie. Gary Busey's performance was great; he was arguably the most memorable character in the movie. There are some impressive areas where the Predator attacks people, such as in the meat factory. But those are the only good things about this mediocre sequel.To sum up, this movie is definitely NOT for faithful fans of the original film. Only hardcore fans would like this film, and action-movie fans would like it too. But to others, this movie will remain a disgrace to the Predator franchise.I give this movie a 2/10.

It's foul-mouthed, racist, and tedious, and it even features a bit of pointless (and decidedly non-stimulating) nudity. It's a real 1980s holdout, with flat action scenes that are too one-sided and blandly shot to be exciting (first, the gang members are totally whaling on the cops; then Glover arrives, and the cops are totally whaling on the gang. Yawn.)One commentator has pointed out that, since the main character is an African-American police officer with two Hispanic partners, the movie can't be racist. Sorry, but even that doesn't offset the stereotypes on parade here. Basically, the film equates minorities with urban hell. And let's not forget the silly voodoo business - that religion never gets proper respect, does it?Scene after scene falls utterly flat. Glover (an awful actor if there ever was one) argues with his superiors constantly, but we never really know why (they don't obstruct him, as far as I can tell). In fact, he ultimately comes across as unreasonable himself, prone to exploding into silly cursing rages about nothing much.The Predator itself is okay, though hardly the most inspired of aliens. It learns a bit of English as the film goes on, but only so it can match the tedious human cast curse-for-curse.I did enjoy a few segments, almost despite myself; the subway scene is exciting, though I can't figure out why the Predator seems immune to Bill Paxton's bullets (later on, Glover doesn't have any problems filling it with holes!)On the whole, though, this is an utter tanker. I'll repeat my usual complaint and shut up - the Alien and Predator franchises probably shouldn't be merged again because the Aliens have about ten million times the class. Even the weakest Alien movie is leagues ahead of this dribble.

However, there are so many things wrong with this movie, by the end I was screaming at the scream 'Just die!' as in my opinion it would f made a better ending.It's the little things that made the movie such a let down, such as In the sex scene, the Jamaicans burst though the door and it takes the people having sex five seconds to realize they are there and too the massive crash. When the woman gets strangled by the predator, how the hell did she survive? The predator wold not of just left her there after only getting the job half done? When the predator is holding onto Mike's arm when he is hanging off of the roof, how did Mike stay on the building because he was not holding onto the building and the predator must of weighed a ton. Mike cannot die, no one could survive an explosion like that, take on and kill a predator, drive into a gang of armed drug lords hanging out of the car door and live to tell the tale. Why didn't the predators kill Mike when they had the chance, instead they let him live and gave him a pistol from the 1700's. This confused me and ruined the film even more for me. The reference to alien with the skulls was not necessary as the movie 'Alien vs. Predator' had not been made yet. This was just stupid.Don't waste your time, buying, renting or watching this film as it was no where near in the same league as the original 'Predator'.

US-centric movies where foreign characters are one dimensional stereotypes serving as cannon fodder only. Just look at the recent second sequel (or fourth, if you count those Aliens vs entries) where it's clear all along - spoiler ahead - that the two characters surviving till the end will be the Caucasian male and female leads.In fairness, such a description does not quite describe Predator 2. While there are some appalling Jamaican accents on show, some gun toting Columbians and a shockingly gratuitous example of female nudity, the lead here is a mid-40s Danny Glover. While it's never quite made clear why the Predator doesn't kill Glover's cop in any of the many chances he gets (other than the fact that it'd make for a far shorter movie) it is kind of nice that a lisping black man gets to be the lead in a mindless action movie.Also, in fairness, the characterisation of the white American characters doesn't fare much better... a group of one-dimensional cut outs who talk constantly about their ass and everyone is a maverick who bucks the system. You've seen that kind of movie before, right? It's a film where a female cop responds to cheesy flirting by squeezing a man's testicles and where the Predator's first words are MF. It's just that kind of movie.Co-written by John Thomas(!) it's a feature that gives no respect to its audience, feeding them inane clichés and patronisingly weak dialogue in order to bolster the runtime. All of the Predator films are weak on plot or genuine motivations, noisy, bloated excesses where the only thing rewarded is the stupidity of the audience.

The plot doesn't measure up to the first, and the fact that someone watched Aliens, and really, really liked it(be it a writer, either the one with the unfortunate name or his brother, or the director) shows, and I don't mean that in the meaning that it is noticeable, but more show as in something you'd be charged a fee to enter, and once you enter the large, colorful tent, you'll view such sights as dancing animals and acrobats.

I'm not going to claim that the first was some piece of art, but still. The acting varies. There are good things herein the effects improved since last time around. Weaponry is expanded.

Plus the more you see it (when it's time for a heads-up), the more it looks like a man in a suit (a well-known problem in horror flicks since Cat People or The Creature from the Black Lagoon).The story is a big mess, characters are thrown in the middle, every one of them just fodder for bloody action. Danny Glover is artificially locked in the role of a naive brutal cop, an odd characterization for the man in charge here (maybe they wanted to add some kind of Lethal Weapon subtlety). The creative team put 90% of its energy in fleshing up the Big Alien Hunter, and finding reason to have it run away until the final showdown which, in turn, is overlong (tough to kill your ugly darling, uh?).The first Predator had the benefit of creating the unknown menace in hostile jungle. The big team of over-armed hunters gradually became the game. With the expectations for the first installment this didn't make sense to build the narrative away from a team of experts trying to come to grips with that elusive phenomenon.

In this disastrous sequel to the vastly superior Predator, we are left to wonder whether someone actually, in good conscience, thought it would be a clever idea to move the Predator into downtown LA, or whether it just took place closer to the movie studio because no one in their right mind would bankroll a film like this, so they couldn't afford any location shoots. My money's on the latter. And another thing, Predator 2 is set in the distant future (far off 1997!!), why would they do something like that? The movie came out in 1990 and then there was only seven years before we saw that downtown LA (specifically the criminals) do not look anything like they are portrayed in the movie. Look at Back to the Future II, for example. It was made almost 20 years ago, and there is still more than a decade before we will all see how wrong they were in predicting what the future would look like. At least the rest of the movie was good.The streets of LA look a lot like they did in the Robocop movies, and the criminals look like they did in Robocop 3, by leaps and bounds the worst of the series. We get all these criminals who are dressed up like circus clowns, and the movie even throws in some crime kingpins that look like caricatures of witch doctors and whatnot. Like they were flown in straight from the mountains of Nepal and asked to say a few lines for the camera. Is this supposed to create the sense of isolation and unfamiliarity that the first movie created so well? Please.Danny Glover takes on the role of Lieutenant Mike Harrigan, basically the leader on the search for the killer who keeps leaving bodies stripped naked, often with things like heads and spinal cords pulled out (not cut, but pulled) and hanging upside down, until the FBI, I think, shows up to take over the investigation. The endlessly watch-able Gary Busey steals the spotlight in every single one of his scenes, but mostly because Glover, also a massively talented actor, for some reason gives a halting and simply bad delivery of his horribly written lines. Busey's character is also pretty badly written, but he has such a recognizable presence that you almost don't notice. Ironically enough, it works to Busey's and the movie's advantage that he simply plays the same character that he almost always plays in his movies &#150; himself. The script is so full of clichés and unrealistic conversation that it sounds like it was written in an afternoon, if that. Had the writers read these lines out loud to themselves while writing it, I assure you they would have realized how ludicrous it sounded.The movie starts with a ludicrous shootout scene between the cops and entire herds of criminals, as the two gangs, you might say, fight for control of the streets. In the pessimistic future view of the movie, much like the Robocop films, crime is out of control, and as you see here, the police are out-manned and outgunned by the drug gangs on the streets. The Predator watches over this whole shootout, always out of sight, no doubt wondering why these creatures are so intent on killing off their own kind.Here's another interesting irony of the movie, the Predator, as is to be expected, comes with all kinds of new weapons, a remodeled mask, and lots of cool gadgetry, some of it meant for self-applied medical treatment, and yet some of the things that are brought over from the original film are just botched. We learn in this movie that the Predator doesn't make himself invisible, but is somehow able to bend light. That's even more impressive than invisibility! It almost gives you the perception that the Predator carries at least some of the power of something like a black hole, but the shimmer effect is just badly done here. I would have thought that a newer movie would have been able to improve upon the one from a few years earlier.Bill Paxton, 4 years after his performance as the over-the-top and entirely too cocky Private Hudson from Aliens, turns in a performance in this movie as exactly the same guy. Overly confident despite being in completely over his head. His role here, as he explains in his interview on the DVD, is to act entirely too sure of himself, like Billy the Kid, until he realizes what he's up against, at which point he turns into the whining baby that he was in Aliens.The only thing that the movie successfully brings over from the previous film is brought over as an excuse to allow a lot more guys to get killed and to make an excuse for the weakness of this movie's plot. The original team killed off by the Predator in South America was a top secret elite team of special forces, as Peter Keyes (Busey) explains to the clueless Harrigan (Glover), which is why the police forces involved have no idea what's going on. This allows for plenty of deaths before the FBI can convince the insubordinate police force (Harrigan, as it were) to believe them that the drug gangs are not involved here, and that they really do need to back off. Seriously, guys. Let us handle this. It's top secret. Harrigan, come on, back off. You don't know what you're dealing with. You don't have the resources or the knowledge to fight this enemy. I know that your friend was killed, but you just have to let us handle this. We know how to get this guy. Come on, Harrigan. I can't tell you what it really is, just let us handle it. OK fine, you see, there was this elite team in South America&#133;The best scene is the hunt scene about three quarters of the way through movie, and it's not good that this is the best scene because it is monumentally stupid. They come up with this great plan to have a room flooded with ultra-violet light while all the men wear these heat-proof spacesuits so the Predator can't see them and on top of that, they put this special dust in the air that will adhere to the Predator's body and make him visible. Great plan, except for the massive flashlights that everyone wears on their shoulders. This is the FBI! I learned in 7th grade that almost without exception, there is NO LIGHT WITHOUT HEAT. Did the FBI not realize that these flashlights were going to generate heat? My GOD.The Predator is just as ugly as in the original, but the mask has been reduced to a cheap Halloween mask, almost as bad as the Green Goblin's mask from Spider-Man. He's got this cool boomerang weapon that seemingly can cut through anything that it comes into contact with, but he talks in this movie. I hate that. Here's this alien, and he learns English just enough to deliver a couple of one-liners at exactly the right moments. At the time of this writing I have yet to see Alien vs. Predator, but I can only hope that they don't talk to each other in it. Leave the talking to Freddy!(spoilers) The grand finale of the movie starts off with a massive hole in both the script and basic logic. Harrigan finds himself hanging from the cables beneath an elevator as it descends, and he's screaming at the people inside it to stop the elevator so it doesn't crush him. Forget the fact that elevators stop a good 6-10 feet above the ground at the bottom of their shafts, this one not only has a rough hole at the bottom, but when Harrigan lets go of the cable, he falls through it and into a massive open area. The scene could ALMOST be saved if it were the basement, but it turns out to be the Predator's cavernous lair. Right there in the basement of some building in downtown LA. And no one ever noticed. We get this lengthy fight scene between Harrigan and the Predator, after which a whole crowd of Predators shows up (why they didn't come out to help their friend is not explained or wondered about), so Harrigan accepts defeat, but it turns out that they only wanted to come collect their dead and give Harrigan a gun from the early 18th Century, raspily muttering, 'Take it.' What the hell is this??Predator 2 is such a bad film that the Predator is the hero rather than the villain. He is the center of attention and we are watching to see these clueless morons get killed by him rather than to see them use their tactical expertise to do away with this unknown enemy, as was the case in the original film. Director Stephen Hopkins has turned the movie away from the action/sci fi of the original and into a horror movie. It's just too bad he couldn't do the same with the comedy that he worked on before this movie, A Nightmare on Elm Street 5.The movie ends with a hint at a Part 3 (with the line 'They'll get their chance.') and I can only hope that AVP is that movie, because the last thing we need is more of this!

But there is a new & highly sophisticated hunter in town who kills the members of both the gangs & ends the turf war once n for all, thus attracting the attention of LAPD officer, Mike Harrigan.Directed by Stephen Hopkins, the film opens with the notorious alien creature hovering over the city & carefully observing the civilian life. It brings the predator into action relatively early but still remains a dull affair from start to finish. The characters are not at all interesting, the dialogues are corny, the action is way too predictable & performances are quite over-the-top.The only plus point is that it provides a little more insight into the predator's so-far mysterious origin & its purpose on the planet. The creature's design is modified compared to its predecessor with many more utilities added for its hunting purposes. Even its visual effects don't hold up as well as it does in the last chapter & its score offers nothing new but slight modifications.On an overall scale, Predator 2 is a highly disappointing follow-up to what still remains one of the finest works in the genre of sci-fi, horror & action and feels much of a cash grab than a necessary sequel.

I've liked Predator for years, the Alien films for even longer. Hated AvP for a few years, and disliked Predators since that came out. I figured I HAD to see Predator 2. The concept is interesting; a Predator stalks his prey in Los Angeles while the city is experiencing a crime wave. A change of scenery from the first Predator. Sounds kinda cool, right? Wrong. The movie shoves that crime wave down your throat from the start.The movie begins with an over-the-top, silly shootout between these downright ridiculous gangsters and the police. I don't like to be nitpicky, but these guys are packing more firepower than the Marines. They retreat into their little hideout and snort coke by the handful, rejuvenated and ready to kill more cops. It's just dumb. I thought Okay, maybe this is just to emphasize that the city is full of these heavily armed bad guys. Throughout the rest of the film we're constantly reminded that Hey! I'm big, scary, and tough an- What?! What's that? A shadowy figure just stabbed my friend! Shoot it! I mean, yes I suppose the original Predator had it's fair share of silly moments, but they were carried out with far more class than this garbage.I don't want to compare this to the original; it's a bad film on it's own. The characters are cardboard cutouts. I'm all for having your typical array of characters in a film, but there needs to be some redeeming factor, something that makes up for it. The thing that stops this movie from a score any lower than a five is the Predator itself. It's a great monster! It combines all the aspects of your standard scary creature and gives it an intellect and tons of gadgets. Combine that with the concept of Now we're the hunted! and that's why the Predator has become such an iconic figure in the Sci-Fi world.I'll admit, about an hour, hour ten minutes into the movie I started to enjoy it. Not so much the one-on-one showdown with the Predator, but when Gary Busey and his guys were hunting the Predator. It was slightly suspenseful, as opposed to the hour of film before it. I was entertained. But right when the Predator reaches out and makes the audience jump and scream, and it delivers it's line, that's when the movie shifted back into mediocrity. That brings me to another point.While this doesn't weigh in on my score or opinion, how can the Predator talk without it's mask? Or better, how can it speak English without it's mask? I had thought all the dialogue we've ever heard from a Predator was from recordings it had made. As well, after the Predator's mask is removed, when we see things from the Predator's point of view, we still see in the heat vision that has become such an iconic part about the character. I mean, I could poke holes like this into some of my favorite movies; I don't mean it as criticism. Just wondering if I know the monster as well as I thought! So if you're reading this and shaking your head, still thinking This idiot doesn't know what he's talking about; it's a classic! Fine, so be it. I just can't understand these (mostly positive) reviews on here. Or at least, the ones I saw mostly ranged from seven to tens even! Hey, it's all opinion, and mine is that the film is bad.

Not Spider-Man three bad, it's actually worse. It's soooooo bad. Just pure horrible. Do not watch it, unless you are ready to watch a movie you'll hate.

Even the people cussed allot I like cussing in movies but when @#$# is said every 3 seconds there is a problem...a big one some times you want to see some serious dialog with out foul language. Like in star wars did Luke say %$#@ when he got his @!%$ hand chopped off no and that was so much better than this !@@. But Danny did a good job acting but i really think Arnold could have been in this and it wouldn't have been as bad. The acting from the female cop was the worst I have ever seen in a film in a long time, but its a good action film so go see it.

The acting is very forced and Danny Glover is miscast, but Gary Busy and Bill Paxton do well though. The creature design on this Predator is disappointing, and doesn't come close to the coolness of the first one -- even if this one has a huge (seemingly impossible to hold) spear and smart-disk. The story is sloppy, as well as the tone and atmosphere. There's elements missing from the first (gore, characters we can relate to and root for) that made it so good, and elements added here that go just too far the nudity.All in all, definitely skip this if you liked or loved the first Predator movie. This contains none of the excitement of the original, and I can only recommend it to those who feel the need to see it.

This film first came a long time ago and I had forgotten the hype. I watched it last night... so I was expecting something similar to Predator 1. Well, actually I didn't have high expectations since I found out that Danny Glover (?) had taken Arnie's place.My first disappointment came just at the beginning when the first shoot is over a kind of forest. The surprise was that after that forest you see high buildings and the overprint Los Angeles 1997. I said WTF, Predator in the city??? OK, I accepted the fact, but then I realized that Danny Glover was portraying about the 90% of the same character he portrayed in Lethal Weapon! In fact, at some point I started to ask When will Mel Gibson appear? Come on! Danny Glover being the tough guy who will defeat the Predator? Give me a break. What they were thinking? I don't have anything against Danny Glover but they couldn't find another actor or what? I still had hopes because I had seen Bill Paxton was in the cast. How stupid I was! His character was like the character he had in Aliens! But worse, because at least in Aliens he was a marine. Here his acting was OK, but well, I was expecting a good backup for Danny Glover or something like that, not an annoying cop. By the way, why Bill Paxton's bullets didn't do anything to the predator???And why latino gangs? Oh, yes. American films always with that racism. Before there were the blacks, then there were the latinos, now probably the gangs are semites.The film is full of implausible things. Where is the police, the army, the authorities? If you know there is an alien killing people in the city probably you would order an immediate evacuation! And how the predator came to the city? This is something never explained in the movie! And there is NOTHING in connection with the first one, just a brief mention of the events where only 2 people survived.I am not a die hard fan of Predator 1, but this sequel really stinks.

While the original began as a Rambo-type actioner and then turned into a claustrophobic thriller, this one emphasizes action, shootouts and mayhem throughout. Extremely loud film, it is not recommended for people with sensitive ears. The one thing the filmmakers didn't compromise was the superiority of the Predator humans are still defenseless against him, and there is no happy ending.

Its like case law, each one cementing some standard that bears little relationship to the original logic. Nowhere is this most obvious than with space ship design. We have three basic types the long spindly affairs from 2002; the grey beasts in different shapes from the likes of *trek and *wars. And then we have stuff like what we have here art deco gold ornaments from 50's pulp covers. Its cheaply done here, but is at least something to recommend this stroll through the ordinary.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 4 You can find something better to do with this part of your life.

I like the actors here, Danny Glover, María Alonso, Ruben Blades, Gary Busey; but the script just couldn't get it. I mean, Glover is a great character actor, Ruben Blades can portrait his roles in a very believable way; but the script is sooooooo lame that no actor would have been able to make this piece of c.... take off. Besides, it looks like a fourth rate production, cheap effects, cheap photography, cheap edition. The characters all look phony, false, with the same depth as the paper the script was printed on. No story line to talk about. The story was no story at all. Just a collection of scenes with almost nothing to connect them through, besides the gore, the blood and the alien. Predictable as hell!!!. Not a single surprise in here. The first movie wasn't really great, but at least was enjoyable. This abortion of a movie does not deserve even a place in the Razzie awards. It's too bad even for that!. After seeing this so called movie, I found myself with a little problem. Now I don't really know which film gets my award for the worst movie ever. This or Fast and Furious. The choice is difficult. Don't loose your money buying or renting this. Don't even lose your time seeing it on cable!

Fast forward ten years from the original; it is now 1997 and Los Angeles has basically become a war-zone because of established criminal gangs.  Enter Danny Glover as a police detective who is bent on returning the city to peace.  However, there is something unworldly that no one can comprehend.  It is a predator, the same type of being that terrorized Schwarzenegger and his men in the original.  Now the alien is killing everyone it can good guys, bad guys, and people who are indifferent.  Predator 2 has a screenplay that could have been impressive, but ultimately falls flat on its face because it becomes more outlandish as time passes.  The direction does not help, as it is not clear or focused either.  Some of the special effects are impressive, but not nearly as great as those from its predecessor.  The performances are actually pretty good as Danny Glover, Bill Paxton, Gary Busey, Maria Conchita Alonso, Robert Davi, Ruben Blades, and Morton Downey, Jr. all add good depth and characterization to the screenplay.  However, this is one of those films that would have been better if it tried to dazzle the audience instead of making them think.  In the end Predator 2 is one of those rare films that is actually too smart for its own good.  Way too smart.  2 stars out of 5.

Mixing unneeded humor with an undesired change of scenery leaves this film wounded before it even reaches the starting gate. Glover is NO Arnold in the least, the acting is horribly overdone, you could tell that a Predator line of toys would soon be on the way, a horrid lame story, crap special effects, all combine to make this one to miss. The only notable scene whatsoever is towards the ending that captured the imagination of fans of the Predator and Aliens franchises. But all for naught because after and impossibly long wait all the audience would get would be the highly Craptacular AVP mockery masquerading as an actual movie, which only served to make this one look good in comparison.Eye Candy Teri Weigel gives frontal My Grade D DVD Extras 5 minute & 42 second 1990 promo featurette; 3 minute, 41 second Making of from 1990; and Theatrical trailer "},{"Title":"An awful sequel to the original","Date":"5 November 2006","Score":"8 out of 26 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" This movie is about the predator again.but this time he is in modern day Los Angelles,where a string of bodies have been discovered.and this time the Predator can blend into his surroundings again,which just happen to be sky scrapers.gimme a break.first off,this dud does not have Arnie.second it looks like it was made for 5 dollars.the premise is kind of dumb.Predator in the jungle i could see,but in Los Angelles.come on.anyway,this is not a worthy sequel to the original.i could not watch it all,because it was so lame.the acting wasn't very good,and there are some good actors here.i think this could have been good movie,if they had spent some money,and thought of a better idea for the story.as it is,this was junk.

Basically in Los Angeles there is a big gang war between the Jamaicans led by voodoo high priest King Willie (Calvin Lockhart) and the Colombians led by Ramon Vega (Corey Rand), and Detective Lieutenant Mike Harrigan (Danny Glover) is trying to stop it. Peter Keyes (Gary Busey) partners him with cocky Jerry Lambert (Bill Paxton), and they are investigating the recent killings in the city. Of course they find out that the murders are not being committed by gang members, in fact the whole city is under threat from an extra-terrestrial danger. Forensics prove that the deaths were caused by an alien creature, The Predator (Kevin Peter Hall) who has returned to Earth with his infra-red vision and shoulder cannon and blades to hunt and kill humans for trophies (skulls, etc). Also starring Rubén Blades as Danny Archuleta, Maria Conchita Alonso as Leona Cantrell, Licence to Kill's Robert Davi as Captain Phil Heinemann, Independence Day's Adam Baldwin as Garber, Kent McCord as Captain B. Pilgrim and Morton Downey Jr. as Tony Pope. The casting of actors like Glover and Paxton doesn't really do much, the city setting is no comparison to the jungle, there is hardly any decent violence, all in all it is a bit of a boring watch, a silly science-fiction action thriller. Adequate! "}]
