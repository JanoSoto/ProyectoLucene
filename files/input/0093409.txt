The acting, the story, the script, the directing, even the IDEA of the movie all combine to make up a fascinating and thrill-packed police film. The cross-cutting at the beginning of the film was particularly effective, in my opinion, as Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) are introduced. The startling difference between their separate lives provides for tons of fun to be had later in the movie. Roger starts his day off as the family man reluctantly celebrating his 50th birthday party with his numerous children and his loving wife in the big family house, while Riggs is shown waking up naked in his trashy trailer and beginning his day with a healthy breakfast of a cigarette and a beer. The fact that both Roger and Riggs hated that they had to work together was especially effective in creating a touching atmosphere as they grew to be closer and closer friends. They worked so well together in this movie; it was a symbiotic relationship. It was almost like they fed off of each other, and kept each other in line and out of trouble. I also liked the way that they showed that Riggs was deeply angered when he learned that the bad guys had taken Murtaugh's daughter. Things like this, when done right, can really get you to sit up and really get into the movie, and it was definitely done right here. Riggs was also very amusing in his anxiousness about being a cop (`Why don't you let me go to sleep?' `No, come on, we gotta get up and catch bad guys!'), and Gary Busey delivers an excellent performance as the lead bad guy. This is the type of role that he plays best (see Under Siege).Although the violence was painfully present in some parts (the torture scenes were short but extremely difficult to watch), the film never relied on violence to pull it along or keep the audience's attention. The story was sufficient enough so that there was no overindulgence necessary in anything like that. In this film you see the first of the now traditional Lethal Weapon scenes in which Riggs and Murtaugh stagger away from a smoking crime scene, seeming to hold each other up. The final fight scene between Riggs and Mr. Joshua (Busey) was a little excessive, and there were a few scenes which were a bit faulty (how did the guy on the building ledge expect to kill himself when there was such a huge air bag inflated on the ground directly below him?), but overall this was a spectacular crime thriller. The movie rushes along at a feverish pace, and particularly Gibson's and Glover's success working together on screen make this a timeless action film that is not to be missed.

In my opinion it almost matches Braveheart which is by all standards a great movie.First of all the overall acting in this movie is nothing short of excellent. Especially Mel Gibson portrays the deeply disturbed Martin Riggs with great finesse and his ability to create nuanced characters shines through in this movie. You genuinely feel with him and feel the incredible weight of his wife's death on him. Furthermore one of the things that makes Mel Gibson one of the really great actors in Hollywood is his ability to portray rage. Pure, uncontrolled rage and he certainly lifts the movie a few nudges acting wise. The other lead actor, Danny Glover, is also great in his role as the aging family father and he literally embodies the part of Roger Murtaugh and his line I'm too old for this s*h*i*t has become a legend in the film world. Gary Busey is one of my top 10 screen bad guys. Not because he is an especially talented or great actor but he brings an edge to his character that makes one believe that he is the perfect nemesis for Riggs. Last but not least we have the underused Mitch Ryan (whom we have come to know best in the part of Edward Montgomery in Dharma and Greg) and he also does a great job with the relatively few lines he is given.In terms of story and interaction between the characters I can only say that it is close to perfection. The meeting between the two main characters is a classic moment and their slowly growing to like each other is also brilliantly done. The on-screen chemistry between the two actors is excellent and I'm tempted to say that they have the best chemistry EVER in film history (perhaps bested only by Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster in Silence of the Lambs). In terms of the story the relationship between Riggs and Murtaugh has been weighed more heavily than in the following movies which means that the villains will naturally be less refined than in the following movies and this weighing is very acceptable because the relationship between Riggs and Murtaugh is the carrying element of the movie.The action in the movie is excellent for an 80s movie. I'll even say that I think that the action in this movie is better than much of the action in movies today because somehow it just seems much more believable in this movie than it does in movies like Die Another Day for example where the action has been amplified so much that it just becomes ridiculous and, lets face it, silly. Most of the action involves Mel Gibson and this works great because he really is one of the greats when it comes to action. He gives the action credibility unlike actors like Sylvester Stallone or Steven Segal. You genuinely believe that he could be able to shoot someone with a sniper rifle at a distance of 1 - 2 kilometers.All in all a movie where basically everything works and is perhaps underrated by the voters of IMDb. 9/10 - watch this movie right now!

Well, if you've seen Lethal Weapon - not only the greatest action comedy, but perhaps also the greatest movie of all time! - you should know that the answer to that question is YES. If you don't, it's very obvious that you need to see a doctor. And in case you for some incomprehensible reason haven't seen Lethal yet, I have only one thing to say stop reading this comment and go rent it immediately!!! There's simply no logical excuse for anyone old enough NOT to see this brilliant movie.The Lethal Weapon series started out with this film back in 1987, starring the phenomenal Mel Gibson as psychotic loose cannon Martin Riggs and Danny Glover (truly wonderful as well) as his total opposite for a partner - family man and by-the-book police officer Roger Murtaugh.Murtaugh lives a happy life with his loving family in a friendly neighborhood and is planning to retire from the force. But on his 50th birthday his life takes off in a different direction when the daughter of an old friend from Vietnam jumps out from a window and dies. This incident tosses Murtaugh into a dangerous and twisted investigation. And as if that's not enough he is also teamed up with a new partner - a burned-out lunatic named Martin Riggs, who's been leaning on the edge of suicide ever since his wife was killed in a car crash. Roger is shocked when he meets this lethal weapon. These two cops only have two things in common they're both Vietnam vets and they both hate working with partners. This is my all time favorite movie, because it gives you everything you could ever ask from a great flick action, drama, suspense, and even love (without getting all sentimental). And if you love Mel Gibson (God, he used to be so beautiful!!)- like me - this is were he makes one of his strongest and most remarkable performances. Actually, I can hardly call it acting - he IS Riggs. The emotions he's going through is so evident in his eyes and so real and cuts right through your soul you can actually feel his pain and his anger. And Mel also contributes a great deal to the humorous element of the film with his attitude, witty comments and eagerness of doing his job Man, I love this job! Can we put the sirens on? Danny Glover is outstanding as Murtaugh and serves the audience a normal, middle-aged man who is fighting with his age, a daughter who's turning into a young woman and a partner who doesn't care whether he lives or dies. Danny's hilarious making those faces and throwing back at Mel! He plays his part with great sensitivity and I think he, just like Mel, gives so much life to his character that no other actor could have done it better. And together, he and Mel undoubtedly makes the best film team there was, is or ever will be! (The concept has been copied too many times, though...With the fantastic action, humor, performances and screenplay, Lethal Weapon and its sequels definitely top the list of all time action movies. Danny and Mel (naturally) won an award for best duo on screen on MTV Movie Awards once, and considering their work with these series, I believe director Richard Donner and producer Joel Silver makes the best duo OFF screen.I'm convinced this is a movie that not only action fans would enjoy watching, so I recommend it to everyone. This is a movie you can't afford to miss!

Badly directed, badly written and badly acted, it is more like a series of action movie clichés than a story. It borrows heavily from various previous superior films especially Dirty Harry. The 'suicidal jumper' scene in both films makes the comparison; in Dirty Harry, the scene was honest, but the inferior copy version, the scene ends with an unearned and deceptive pay-off, a cheat in other words. It is not possible to speak of the plot being contrived, but rather a series of implausible contrivances one after another. The basic idea, an unstable cop being allowed to continue working (and even being transferred to homicide!), is utterly absurd in itself but it gets worse. Basic procedures, such as handcuffing subdued criminals, are not adhered to, leading to two characters drawing weapons and having to be killed. People start shooting for no apparent reason, such as at the swimming pool. A hackneyed and unconvincing plot about a secret conspiracy emerges. An over the top shoot out in the desert, complete with helicopter. A gruesome (but laughable) torture scene. Gibson hurls a dead body across a room like a deadly weapon. A sub-machine gun fight takes place on a crowded free-way. And a final punch-up while the cops just look on.Everything about this film is clunky. It takes a long time for the story to get going and it is held together by certain convenient details. The dialogue is wooden, as is the acting (apart from the kids, who at least emerge with credit). The music is of the late 80s variety, and sounds very dated now.Nor are the action scenes very memorable, just a series of deeply contrived set pieces which neither look good nor convince. Situations are set-up just so a car can drive through a wall or hit a bus or explode. There is no artistry in any of this, and none of it lingers in the memory.A cartoon, and not a particularly good one.

However, this proves to have some relevance to the plot of Lethal Weapon.Basically veteran cop Murtagh (Glover)is assigned to investigate this incident which is initially deemed to be a 'suicide'. However, an autopsy confirms that the young woman was poisoned before she jumped, therefore she was murdered before she jumped. Murtagh must try to find out who poisoned the young woman and why, but he's not alone in investigating this case and is assigned a partner Riggs (Gibson). Riggs is a suicidal, unhinged police officer who has a very different method of policing to the more 'by the book' Murtagh.The majority of the humour stems from scenes with Murtagh and Riggs as both of them have a completely different style of policing. Murtagh is more straight laced and has more of a general regard for following police procedure. Whereas Riggs is unorthodox and wild and will go to more extreme methods (as you'll see in the scene where he's on the roof with a potential suicide victim). The character development is also good. Riggs in particular is afforded some depth - we learn that his wife of 11 years was killed in a car accident which explains his suicidal tendencies - it perhaps also helps to explain his rather 'gung ho' approach to policing (as he already feels suicidal, he probably doesn't fear death as much as your average police officer). We also see Murtagh's home life and see that he is a real family man. Both men show their human side, but also show that they can kick a lot of ass when necessary.There were a couple of problems with Lethal Weapon; Firstly, the final scene where Riggs is left to fight Joshua (Busey) outside Murtagh's house and no police officers bother to intercept until Riggs finally manages to get the better of him. Whilst it was dramatic and a reasonably good finale, it wasn't entirely believable. Secondly; I also felt that at times the film was a bit drawn out and it was disappointing that the baddies were given a lot less screen time than I would have hoped for.That being said, Lethal Weapon is still a good film but this is mainly due to the great on screen chemistry between Gibson and Glover.

He's very aware of his own faults and his relation to the world around him, a personal facet of the character as written that I find consistently amusing. Shane Black is unafraid to explore the scuzzier side of police work with his writing - in fact he positively wallows in it - so we're happy to accept with these two things combined that Lethal Weapon isn't just a catchy title, it might actually be the truth.Although the pairing of two such types is predictable, Danny Glover is equally as good in a different way taking on the role of Riggs' straight-laced partner. The banter between the two is very sharp but always stops just short of being terminally cutting. It's a teaming that each successive sequel builds upon to advantageous effect.This instalment is definitely the grittiest of the four, as thereafter the studios and Black's replacement scribes experimented with leavening the balance between action and humour. Over time Riggs' rough edges became sanded down, but for a full demonstration of his madcap antics when he was at his crazy peak, be sure not to miss this one.

Riggs has some inner demons with which he must cope (the loss of his wife), and starts every day thinking of reasons why he shouldn't swallow a bullet.  In the end, it's the job that keeps him going; it's what he does best in the world.  Meanwhile, Detective Sergeant Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) is dealing with some issues in his own life  He just turned fifty, has a teenaged daughter who is suddenly grown-up and dating, and he's just been assigned a new partner, Riggs, whom he quickly learns has a propensity for dangerous situations and apparently has a death wish.  His assessment of his situation is summed up with his now classic line, `I'm too old for this ----.'  And the adventure begins. 	The plot involves an investigation into the death of a young woman, Amanda Hunsaker (Jackie Swanson), the daughter of an old war buddy of Murtaugh's, Michael Hunsaker (Tom Atkins), who is now a successful banker.  Ultimately, it leads Riggs and Murtaugh into some murky waters where they encounter a former General, Peter McAllister (Mitchell Ryan), and some ex-special forces mercenaries, including the especially psychotic Mr. Joshua (Gary Busey).  There's some twists and turns along the way, but most importantly Donner keeps the action going and the tension building all the way to the climax.  The dialogue is sharp, the story and characters are developed extremely well, and Donner wisely injects some humorous moments (courtesy of Gibson, with shades of The Three Stooges) that provide a respite to the intensity of the overall proceedings.  But what really makes this movie is the pairing of Gibson and Glover. 	Perfectly cast as Riggs, Gibson is at his charismatic best here.  He brings a depth to his character usually reserved for more dramatic fare, and layers him with a complexity that makes Riggs so much more than just another action hero.  If you look deeply enough, you'll find a bit of McQueen's `Bullitt' in him.  To his credit, Gibson took what could have been just another `star' outing and created a truly memorable character.  Glover, as well, breathes real life into Murtaugh; he lets you in on what really makes his character tick, what his loyalties are and his perceptions of the world in which he lives.  Like Gibson, he gets beneath the surface and gives you a lot more; much more than meets the eye.  And there's a chemistry between the two that really clicks and makes it all work so well.  Watching these guys operate is real kick; they give the audience something to relate to, and it's that connection they make with the viewer that is one of the reasons the `Lethal' films have been so successful. 	Also memorable in supporting roles are Darlene Love, as Roger's wife, Trish; and Traci Wolfe as their daughter, Rianne.  In the end, `Lethal Weapon' is an exhilarating, entertaining movie that introduces some great characters that happily, for the audience, return in the sequels.  It's like meeting good people who become your friends for life.  But be prepared; once you've seen this one, you're going to HAVE to see the rest.  And I guarantee, you're going to want to see them all more than once, so be ready to add to your DVD/video collection.  These are keepers. I rate this one 9/10.

And Danny Glover, equally, comes alive on the screen, a little goofy as well, of course, but comfortable as the dad in a functioning middle class family. The two men are cops, thrown together and by some stroke of bad luck, pitched into high stakes dramas one after another.And if you really bother paying attention, the plot is a strain, made more for effect than anything that matters or even quite makes sense. There are ex-CIA heroin dealers and absurd (and dangerous) helicopter chases, fantastic skills with guns and an even more fantasy-like muddy hand-to-hand fist fight under the spray of a broken fire hydrant at night. Yeah, it's crazy and over the top and you just have to dive in and say, cool, go for it, great filming, funny one-liners.It's a moment for moment movie with a handful of clunker moments but hundreds of crazy fast and exciting ones. For all they are worth. In some ways, at least, as entertainment straight up, a kind a television on steroids, this is a great movie.

We all love them. They have heroes, explosions, foreign villains, amazing gunfights and pretty much all you need to have fun. But there is one type of action movie that we love the most, the so- called buddy films. They got almost what every action flick has (all mentioned above). But there is one major difference. In this type of movie, instead of one hero, you get two. Generally they are both partner cops and struggle to solve a major case involving drug-dealers. And Richard Donner's 1987's 'Lethal Weapon' is the movie that practically created this buddy movie genre, and it's still copied nowadays. But what makes 'Lethal Weapon' so special? We shall see. 'Lethal Weapons' story centers around its two major characters Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover), both cops who are partnered to solve a case involving a gang of drug smugglers. Although the story may seem a bit cliché nowadays, that is because it was copied so many times - back then, it was fresh and new. But the main force that makes Shane Black's script so great is the depth of his two main characters and their relationship. They are so different that it's hard to understand how they get along so well. Riggs is a self-destruct, and almost suicidal cop, and that makes him the Lethal Weapon referred to on the title. Murtaugh, on the other hand, is just a simple detective, a family man who served in Vietnam and has been on the force for nearly 20 years. And it's this difference of opinion and style that makes the movie as good as it is - it's practically a love story between two thought guys in the middle of chases, gunfights, explosions. The dialog here is also marvelous - you sure are going to remember most of the main quotes. There are also a few funny lines and sequences to light up the mood a little bit.As stated, 'Lethal Weapon''s script revolves around Gibson and Glover. Therefore, the story simply wouldn't work without good acting of the pair. But thankfully, Mel Gibson and Danny Glover have so much chemistry on screen that you end up believing they are Riggs and Murtaugh on skin and flesh. They both deliver excellent performances, and, in my opinion, even Oscar-worthy ones, Specially for Gibson. The scene where Riggs almost kills himself in his apartment is quite an impressive achievement for Gibson, being the best scene on his career. And Glover also manages to deliver a very good performance. But apart from the main duo, there isn't really a lot to add on what refers to acting. No one from the supporting cast did a above-average job, but they really didn't need to. Gibson and Glover sure can hold the bar on their own.Another point that impressed me upon watching 'Lethal Weapon' was Richard Donner's directing. I've watched most of his other flicks, and I believe this is the best job he did since 'Superman'. He managed to always keep the pace of the flick, never let the bar go or anything. And also he did a incredible job filming the action scenes. The helicopter scene, to give the best example, is quite breath-taking, so is the chase at the end of the movie. And talking about the end - both the ending and the initial scenes are shockingly well-filmed. Technically, I can't also find many flaws in 'Lethal Weapon' - Stephen Goldblatt's cinematography works very well, so does the editing by Stuart Baird. If you're wandering if the musical score is good or not, there is only one thing to be said Eric Clapton did it (along with Michael Kamen).What can I say? 'Lethal Weapon' is the movie that started it all - it started the buddy film genre and introduced us to Roger Murtaugh and Martin Riggs, characters we all know and love. The movie's script is awesome, and it's still copied nowadays. Richard Donner's directing is also great, but what makes it almost perfect is the chemistry between Mel Gibson and Danny Glover. Donner, Gibson, and Glover would still come back for three other sequels, but nothing can come close to the magic that was the first movie. Recommended to anyone who likes action flicks or just wanna have a good time.9/10 "}{"Title":"Periodically smart and generally wry in an entertaining sense, Lethal Weapon is a taut enough crime thriller with some likable lead characters broken down and explored.","Date":"13 October 2010","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" There is a great deal more fun to be had out of the combination of the two leads and their respective studies in 1987's Lethal Weapon than mostly anything else, their connection and the manner in which the two actors deliver the material much more interesting than whatever narrative or subplots to do with this, that or t'other which arise. By the time the film has descended into topless hard bodied males duking it out on a sodden lawn in a somewhat erotic display of masculinity and strength, the film has dealt humorously and substantially enough with how these two can't, in any way, feasibly link with one another given their respective life-situations at the respective point of meeting before having them gleefully link. The thrill is in the lead pairing and how the film observes that each needs the other one to advance to the next stage in both life and thinking; Lethal Weapon being really rather an intimate character study of two police officers, whom will end up on different roads as to when we first saw them, masquerading as an action picture. Director Richard Donner etches out as much as possible from these notions and idea before allowing the stunts and spectacle to just fill in the blanks along the way.Donner, in fact, opens the film with what is quite a long, remarkable tracking shot over the Los Angeles canopy layer of the numerous skyscrapers on show; the music bright and bubbly, your more typical establishing shot of a place so as to hammer home precisely where we all are on show. In the same take, the camera will descend into a high-rise building of apartments to reveal a semi-naked girl who takes some cocaine before leaping from a balcony and to her death. Just as the tone changes in the uncut crane shot, the atmosphere and content change with it; the greater extent of this wonderful opening being that it is how Donner will go on to construct the film, as a bright; airy and breezy piece with some harmless scenes of domesticisation and a carefree attitude to most scenes - granted, with a scene of suicidal ideation thrown in. But all this is before having everything descend into a more sordid, less glamorous zone when nastiness and sleaze come out of nowhere and now top the bill.The two lead's are both Sergeants, Mel Gibson's character is Martin Riggs while it is Danny Glover playing Roger Murtaugh. Their binary oppositional traits lie within their home-life, their attitudes to their work and just about everything else going on in their lives; eventual change and recognition as well as the opportunity to advance the end result. For Murtagh, his gradual getting by in the police department sees him attend crime scenes; take notes and generally do a lot of administrative work as he lives in the ideal detached house in a suburban part of California with the ideal family, an early scene in which they surprise him whilst he's in the bath outlining what a close knit group the Murtaugh's are as a background mirror reflecting his family hints at a literal 'reflecting' of a perfect family based unit. Roger is a Vietnam War veteran pushing fifty whom needs to be reminded that said war happened as long ago as it did and is having to come to terms with the growing up of his daughter Rianne (Wolfe), someone coming to be preoccupied with dressing up and going out in the evenings.On the jump side of things, Gibson's rough and messy trailer dwelling loner Martin Riggs is struggling with the recent death of his wife and is suicidal as a result; his much more 'hands on' police work when compared to Murtaugh's seeing him take gross, unnecessary risks with hardened criminals during a drug busts so as to further the possibility of on the spot release from life. Their pairing is the result of the aforementioned woman whom jumped from the balcony, something which is treated as a murder when traces of poison were found in the body upon investigation. Through being placed together, Riggs comes to observe a healthy family unit while gradually feeling better about himself while you feel Murtaugh comes to acknowledge his job a lot more after being involved in harsher, meaner police work as well as observing his own family and everything he's worked for become grossly threatened. By the end, Murtaugh has learnt to shoot to kill rather than just to do as before in maiming, as Riggs becomes more level headed the more he works with a family man. The thrill is in the way these two bounce off of one another, their respective life situations coming to compliment one another as changes are afoot whilst Riggs has some genuinely funny lines throughout.A plot involving a sadistic ex-American serviceman now turned evil mercenary and drug runner named Mr. Joshua (Busey), a man who is far more threatening than the name suggests, sees the two of them get in way over their heads but effectively renders their plight one of a fight against corruption and former patriots using their powers and abilities for wrong-doing. It's here the film becomes only a moderately interesting causality driven chase thriller, how Donner structures his film's opening shot only now resonating with us in its foreshadowing of something quite warm and welcoming becoming seedier and nastier as we delve in deeper with the peak of which is a pair of nasty interrogation sequences and some stark peril involving young Rianne. With a sharp and engaging more often than not screenplay from Shane Black, plus a competent job of direction from Richarcd Donner, Lethal Weapon is around about smart enough and entertaining enough to give a go.

In this first film, they reluctantly team up to bring down a drug cartel run by high-level mercenaries. The plot is rather average, but what pushes this film into A-list category is the pitch-perfect chemistry between Gibson and Glover, and the dark humor throughout. Roger Murtaugh (Glover) has just turned 50, and is a few years from retirement when the death of the daughter of an old army buddy teams him up with Martin Riggs (Gibson), a burned-out, seemingly suicidal cop grieving over the recent loss of his wife. In a stand-out scene, we see Riggs, alone, ready to kill himself while looking over his wedding photo. Excellent acting, and from a buddy-cop picture! As the two cops begin to slowly earn each other's trust (after Riggs saves Murtaugh's life), the chemistry really kicks in. It's as though these guys have known each other 100 years! Gary Busey (once brilliant in THE BUDDY HOLLY STORY) is reduced to an albino thug, here. But, if it's any consolation, he's very menacing. Watching this film again after about eight years or so, it struck me how brooding and sober it was compared to the more cartoonish sequels (which are also fun in their own right). But LW 1 has a darker energy and while the humor is still there, it's just a little more sporadic. The stunt-work is amazing, but not gargantuan! Compared to how ridiculously over-the-top big-budget cop films have become lately (LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD, for example), LW 1 is the FRENCH CONNECTION! Lots of character-driven scenes (the Murtaugh family dinner scene feels improvised, as though the cameras just happened to catch it), and also some great location work (spanning a lot of Southern California; from the desert to the beach). Some not-so-PC dialogue (a nearly subliminal gay slur, and some racist bits, such as Who's the chin?) aside, the movie is a product of its time, and the writing reflects that. Warts and all. And despite a recycled, Miami Vice-rehash of a plot (right down to a neon-lit nightclub as a front), LW 1 is the most enjoyable of the '80s buddy-cop films. It's spawned three sequels (so far). And among the countless imitators, few have really captured the magic and chemistry of the lead actors (one possible exception being the first RUSH HOUR). Watching them work on DVD was almost like revisiting old friends! Not many cop films of that (or any) period give one that feeling. Lethal Weapon still shoots on the mark after 20 (!) years!

At the top of list is Lethal Weapon, a film that I saw at a very young age (much younger than I should have been), thus developed a fond attachment to ever since. It had been a few years since I had watched Lethal Weapon in its entirety and I must say it held up very well, much better than its sequels, which despite being on cable television constantly, I can never fully sit through.Like 48 Hrs. before it (and obviously the influence for it), part of the reason the picture is such a successful buddy flick is the great blend of action, comedy, and drama. The three genres are mixed together perfectly by director Richard Donner and screenwriter Shane Black to form a great dramatic action-packed thrill ride with a few laughs along the way. However, the most important, real reason behind its success is the characters. I know it seems hard to believe, but there was a time when there were characters to go with the action in the genre. Danny Glover as Roger Murtaugh and Mel Gibson as Martin Riggs come across as real people with real feelings so when it comes time to fight with the bad guys, the audience feels real danger. The bad guys are actually scary villains as opposed to the villains of today who speak with bad accents and throw out tough-guy one-liners.If there is one flaw that time cannot change, its the now legendary fight at the end. As effective as it is, it goes on for a bit too long. It's one of the best sequences Richard Donner has ever done, though had it been reduced by a minute or two, it could have been the best. It's a testament to the talent of Donner, Shane Black, Gibson, and Glover that twenty years after its theatrical release, Lethal Weapon stands as an almost flawless classic. 9/10 (Note the director's cut DVD restores some extremely powerful scenes not included in the theatrical cut).

This was the best of the Lethal's franchise. The idea was fresh with these two, and Mel was as big in this character as king Kong!! I know because of the recent situations with Gibson, on that they will disagree. I do love his stand on The Passion of the Christ, I live for HIM too. But I'm talking about his character portrayal the quintessential 'Gibson' man, in this box-office giant that if it had been someone else, it may have not done the type of business that it did. The feeling was for Martin Riggs. He wore it well. Losing the love of his life, you could feel the agony in his soul. The exchange between the two, Riggs and Murtaugh was an incredible balancing act. It would have to be or one end or the other would up end them both. A cop who's on the ragged edge almost explosive and a family man, who has a tight-nit group that would end up caring for a man in need of care. In return, he (riggs) with his quick -acting sharp-shooter trained conditioning, that actually came natural to his character and his ' wits' , would end-up, saving Roger from losing his life and that family . This was (I think) an original story that, like some others, for instance,  Indiana Jones ,  Predator  etc leaves you feeling a different emotion altogether. Sometimes these features should be left alone not made again and again until the real essence of the original story and characters has been recycled so many times that its water thin in the end. This has an alternate ending on the DVD which was perfect in my eyes, they should have used it. But money is 'king' even over art, right?The first is best. Shane Black made this right .

I know that this really isn't a movie for small children but if you were over 12 and could stomach a few violent action scenes this was the ultimate viewing experience.I will not go into plot as everybody probably knows what it is about but just say that Mel Gibson was only known to me as Mad Max and Danny Glover was a complete unknown at the time of this movie's release. This isn't Mad Max but something few have ever duplicated, an action movie that not only has action but also a simply brilliant premise. The reason why the two main characters start to like each other after a while is completely plausible because they basically think that what they are doing is worthwhile although Riggs, the Gibson character, pretends that he simply doesn't care anymore.The villains, one of them played by Gary Busey are what they should be and the women characters are simply background stuff because this is after all a buddy picture not a relationship picture. Shane Black, the writer has often been criticized for being too sexist (eg. The Last Boy Scout) but the feeling of seeing a real action film without the mushy stuff is somehow enjoyable. The women would play a greater part in the sequels.To end it, there will probably never be another one of these pictures that we will not compare to this one and indeed the buddy picture is almost dead today or it has been written more as comedies than action films.

Mel Gibson was already a star when he played Lieutenant Martin Riggs, but Lethal Weapon made him into a superstar along with Danny Glover as his partner Detective Roger Murtaugh. Initially, Lethal Weapon looked like just another cop buddy partner epic, but the charismatic coupling of the haywire Riggs and the down-to-earth Murtaugh gave the movie a flavor that tasted good. Riggs is the cop that nobody wants to work with; he is the cop who has gone beyond the pale. In a way, he is a shorter version of Dirty Harry with many of Harry's problems, including the death of his wife. The villains are hard as nails and the action is ultra-cool thanks to Donner's first-class helming. The opening scene with the girl who dives off the apartment building balcony is cool.

The targeted audience is perhaps very satisfied with the result. It is a dull action popcorn flick with lots of crude jokes on it. I really don't get the appeal of this kind of film, it offends my intellectual capacities, but i can understand why some people do like this one so much. The fans of the 'popcorn' sub-genre do _and the future ones will_ absolutely love it. Mel Gibson actually overacts a lot, and so Danny Glover does. But that aspect do actually made some sense, since the film is plain over the top. And the soundtrack is actually very good. I really like it. It brings to the film a entire new type of atmosphere, a more neo- romantic thriller one. So...it's worth of one watch, i guess.

How about the slapstick acting caricaturing the police force of the time, to be sure an ancient time when officers went about shouting Yipikaye to the baddies as they killed them unmercifully. The schmaltzy family scenes in contrast to the vigilante attitudes? No matter how laughable this always was or how dated it's getting it was always prime entertainment and a great way to spend two hours. Like Die Hard it was a deliberate and laudable propaganda attempt to get black and white people to understand together and to work for their common good together. Like Die Hard it had Christmas violence and baddies beyond the pale, in fact albino &#x96; baddies who only deserved to be terminated.It portrayed a brilliant fantasy world where Health & Safety or police protocols played no part, along with mobile phones, the internet and without the cgi cartoonery that's taken over movies in the last 20 years. There seemed to be plenty of time to enjoy nonsensical action films such as this back then.

Well, if you've seen Lethal Weapon - not only the greatest action comedy, but perhaps also the greatest movie of all time! - you should know that the answer to that question is YES. If you don't, it's very obvious that you need to see a doctor. And in case you for some incomprehensible reason haven't seen Lethal yet, I have only one thing to say stop reading this comment and go rent it immediately!!! There's simply no logical excuse for anyone old enough NOT to see this brilliant movie.The Lethal Weapon series started out with this film back in 1987, starring the phenomenal Mel Gibson as psychotic loose cannon Martin Riggs and Danny Glover (truly wonderful as well) as his total opposite for a partner - family man and by-the-book police officer Roger Murtaugh.Murtaugh lives a happy life with his loving family in a friendly neighborhood and is planning to retire from the force. But on his 50th birthday his life takes off in a different direction when the daughter of an old friend from Vietnam jumps out from a window and dies. This incident tosses Murtaugh into a dangerous and twisted investigation. And as if that's not enough he is also teamed up with a new partner - a burned-out lunatic named Martin Riggs, who's been leaning on the edge of suicide ever since his wife was killed in a car crash. Roger is shocked when he meets this lethal weapon. These two cops only have two things in common they're both Vietnam vets and they both hate working with partners.This is my all time favorite movie, because it gives you everything you could ever ask from a great flick action, drama, suspense, and even love (without getting all sentimental). And if you love Mel Gibson (God, he used to be so beautiful!!)- like me - this is were he makes one of his strongest and most remarkable performances. Actually, I can hardly call it acting - he IS Riggs. The emotions he's going through is so evident in his eyes and so real and cuts right through your soul you can actually feel his pain and his anger. And Mel also contributes a great deal to the humorous element of the film with his attitude, witty comments and eagerness of doing his job Man, I love this job! Can we put the sirens on? Danny Glover is outstanding as Murtaugh and serves the audience a normal, middle-aged man who is fighting with his age, a daughter who's turning into a young woman and a partner who doesn't care whether he lives or dies. Danny's hilarious making those faces and throwing back at Mel! He plays his part with great sensitivity and I think he, just like Mel, gives so much life to his character that no other actor could have done it better. And together, he and Mel undoubtedly makes the best film team there was, is or ever will be! (The concept has been copied too many times, though... With the fantastic action, humor, performances and screenplay, Lethal Weapon and its sequels definitely top the list of all time action movies. Danny and Mel (naturally) won an award for best duo on screen on MTV Movie Awards once, and considering their work with these series, I believe director Richard Donner and producer Joel Silver makes the best duo OFF screen.I'm convinced this is a movie that not only action fans would enjoy watching, so I recommend it to everyone.

These scenes are well-handled by Donner, while Gibson (as Riggs) provides a moving portrayal.Danny Glover, who's been watchable in many movies, as the steady and careful Murtough contrasts well with his manic, though talented colleague, Riggs.

Also in one scene he even puts a gun to his chin. You can feel the tension growing. The supporting roles are good too. Gary Busey plays a killer who works for the bad guy. He chases the characters a lot in the movie. Glover's character has a family which is rare in movies because they barely show the black person having a family.

Richard Donner who's also directed Superman The Movie throws action scenes at us and they're really good. One of them is in the desert when Glover comes alone while Gibson hides in the bush. There's a big shoot out that ends with a car being chased by a helicopter.

It cemented the superstar status of Mel Gibson - already essential casting following the success of Mad Max, and also turned Danny Glover into a household name. But crucially, the script - despite being a typical 80s action thriller that stretches credibility to its most unlikely point - actually works because of the mesmerising chemistry between Gibson and Glover. The two bounce off each other and the dialogue sizzles in between the breathtaking action sequences. It's the best on screen partnership since Newman and Redford in Butch Cassidy, and rarely can two characters have been so neon-lit as being 'the good guys'. The set pieces are tremendous - from Gibson's attempts to bring down a suicidal man from the top of a tower block to his hilarious yet unmissable brush with a gang of drug dealers early on, this top the buddy-movie genre onto another level. Of course the movie spawned another 3 sequels and became one of the most recognisable franchises in modern Hollywood. But this is entertainment at its very best, and Gibson has rarely been better. His psychotic, crazed cop blessed with martial art and sharpshooting skills most of his colleagues don't have made him the perfect rampaging crusader and his star status was assured after this.

What we have here is a franchise that never knew when to quit, often hiding behind the first picture to shelter security and ward off nah-sayer's.

Murtaw (Glover) plays the spry, gran-pappy, only shoot to injure, fatherly pug who's never too old for anything. Shane Black who would later go on to pen some of the best action flicks of our time, lays down some nice track here.

In addition, it broke barriers by adding a lot of subliminal Can't we all just get along messages.

When it didn't, it was slow and a little bit too realistic, like you were watching a dysfunctional family or cop partners on TruTV. Thankfully, that was only 10%.My parents took me to Lethal Weapon 2 in 1989. I was 14 and was allowed in due to being accompanied by adults. I had yet to see the original for years to come. I fell madly in love with part two. Unfortunately, once I was able to see this, I was disappointed as it was not as action-packed or funny as part 2. That said, this is still worth watching.

We really get to know Murtagh, the dedicated family man, and Riggs, the broken widow. Scenes like where Murtagh is having dinner or where Riggs contemplates suicide helped me relate to them not just as cops, but as people with other things going on.So while they are efficient in their jobs, they are also very vulnerable and very human. So when they get caught up in a fight against the bad guys in the second half, I cared for their fates.

(This knowledge had already been discovered by the James Bond team, but only with the success of Star Wars and the Indiana Jones films did it at last become obvious to all.) Look, Lethal Weapon, like so many other action films since that discovery was made, is a factory product. Some committee came up with the idea and set about hiring a team to realize it. It is all surface and no substance. There's no vision here, it's all meant to make money, that's all.I enjoy this film, very much - I've seen it over and over again, and I am thrilled by the action scenes and amused by the humor.

It's very slick, but it's also noisy, and clunky in spots, exploitative (did we really need to see the porn film the dead girl made?), overlong (with occasionally questionable editing choices), and it's dramatic moments are clearly intended to manipulate rather than arouse our emotions. This isn't even remarking the lack of realism regarding police procedure or the consequences of the behavior of the two heroes. Finally, as is apt for a B-movie, all the major players ham it up something fierce.But all this is entirely forgivable once one admits that, yeah, it's just a B-movie, after all, an amusing way to spend two hours when you have nothing better to do and want to watch good guys chase bad guys and blow things up.

I've seen it so many times that I can annoy those around me by uttering lines in unison with the characters on screen. Yet, no matter how many times I watch it, I am always baffled at how quickly the hour and forty five minutes pass as I reach the end, feeling satisfied, yet yearning for more. That's the kind of movie this is. It's got an insane amount of re-playability, which is due, I suppose, to the fact that the story works on so many levels. Lethal Weapon is equal parts action movie, drama, comedy and buddy flick, all wrapped up nice and neatly in a perfectly sized and perfectly portioned little action-movie burrito. The perfect action film? The best of it's kind? It just may be.One thing is for sure, and that is that Richard Donner is the unsung hero of 1980's cinema. If it weren't for the groundwork he laid in this movie, the action genre -- as it played out in it's aftermath -- wouldn't have been quite as memorable or exciting. That's because Donner -- along with screenwriter Shane Black -- raised the bar, raised expectations and quenched the thirst of audiences. To have an action movie with real characters that you really cared about was a rarity for the time. Those looking for an all-encompassing movie, something that can be both a tearjerker and a nail-biter, will find just that in Lethal Weapon any time they view it. And at a stunning twenty-one years of age, it has yet to be outdone and hardly feels dated.Mel Gibson stars alongside Danny Glover, and it's hard to imagine one without the other. Would this film be as good had different actors been cast? It's doubtful. While Gibson brings the psychotic, alcoholic Martin Riggs to life almost naturally, it's Glover's grounded performance of family-man Roger Murtaugh that makes up the heart of the film. More than just a buddy-cop flick, Lethal Weapon is also a story about redemption, as Murtaugh welcomes a troubled Riggs into his family circle. It's Murtaugh's friendship that helps Riggs patch up his wounds, as he mourns the tragic loss of his wife to a fatal car accident. Even though the movie is too manly to admit so, at it's core, it's a touching story about the power of friendship and loyalty.There's also action. Lots and lots of action. Donner constantly bombards us with explosions, gun-play, car crashes and so on, and manages to keep it fresh throughout. Whereas in other films an abundance of action can get tiresome, such is not the case here. The action bits in this film will keep you on the edge of your seat and glued to the screen. The movie is just so well-crafted in that sense. I can safely say that I, personally, am never bored with this film, and it's a testament as to why Lethal Weapon is the best of it's kind.

But this is one of those movies were the story comes totally secondary and the power of the movie is in its main characters and their chemistry they have on the silver screen. They make you forget the story and make you sit back, relax and just enjoy this professionally made action-comedy.Both Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are acting wonderful in this movie. They are believable in their roles and give the characters some real depth and sense of credibility. It's rare for good actors to play the main role in action movies, since action movies (especially in the '80's) always have a though and cool main character in it. Lethal Weapon is an exception and it is an action movie with realistic main characters in it, of flesh and blood and with real emotions and personalities. It makes Lethal Weapon a very original action movies that has been much imitated ever since but has never been surpassed yet, by any other action movie franchise.Gary Busey plays a good typical 'Gary Busey villain role'. Whatever happened to his career by the way? I rarely ever see him in new movies anymore. A real shame because he is one of those typical actors that can basically play a villain in whatever movie comes on his path and whatever his role is.The action is fairly good but it's typical '80's stuff'. There are some spectacular sequences but in general it all is nothing really memorable. The main essence of the movie is truly on the entertainment value, rather than on its action.All in all this is a fun and entertaining action movie that is a 'classic' thanks to it's two main characters, perfectly played by Gibson and Glover, who have some great chemistry and thanks to Richard Donner's directing, who with this movie delivers yet another entertaining and fun movie that is very likable.8/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"The film that defined the action genre","Date":"18 February 2005","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" Compared to all the recent trash we get these days, Lethal Weapon is a classic. Brutal, funny and action packed, this really is an action film for the ages. But not all ages. Starting off with a tutorial into the more Un-favourable side of L.A. life and drug use, we are straight into the whole concept; this is a buddy movie. There are two main characters the ever lovable Roger Murtaugh (as Danny Glover) a middle-aged man who doesn't want to lose his respectable life and Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) a mad man who will do anything to stop crime (including jumping off a building). There target drug kingpin Gary Busey. It's not a superb film it's the style in which it's done. It's action-packed, funny, yet still stern, but is done to the effect that it's so enjoyable. It really is hard not to love it. An action-packed, violent comedy, Lethal Weapon defined action films and is a lovable classic that should be appreciated by anyone old enough to handle it.

Richard Donner's direction and Mel Gibson and Danny Glover's acting elevate Lethal Weapon into something more than the sum of its parts. Shane Black's script is polished and professional, largely free of extraneous elements or logical leaps. But the plot it conveys is as hackneyed as crime fare gets a simple drug deal sloppily adorned with prostitutes. It has less flair and intrigue than a side mission in a Grand Theft Auto game. Happily, it's not where Black and Donner and Gibson place their focus.Even people who have not seen Lethal Weapon know it as one of the first movies in which a mismatched pair of cops are thrust together and form an unlikely friendship. And even before this gimmick became one of the biggest clichés in entertainment, it was already corny and obvious. The characters are drawn in glaring, unambiguous colors Gibson is incredibly temperamental and reckless, and Danny Glover is an equally-incredibly contented family man. Glover's birthday gathering around a bubble bath is ridiculous, but it's an efficient way to link his character in an instant to all things good and comfortable and domestic. We know what he's about before he utters a word. Gibson doesn't utter, he shouts maniacally, but his character is also defined through exaggerated imagery. He stands unflinching in a hail of bullets, then watches TV alone on Christmas with a bottle of scotch and a loaded gun. (Incidentally, count the TVs in this film. They're everywhere. And when one gets destroyed, another one turns up&#x97; twice!) Surely even Marlowe and Spade had more humanity than this cartoon-watching cartoon of a cop. But Lethal Weapon doesn't need Gibson to be real any more than it needs a great plot, because its focus is unwaveringly fixed on just one thing the chemistry between the cops.Donner is famous for infusing unreal characters with humanity. He brought out the sensitivity and aching in the Man of Steel. He's the perfect director to kindle the sparks that fly between Gibson and Glover. Donner ensures that one or both are always at the center of the action, which is not over when the bodies hit the floor or when the dust settles, but when Gibson and Glover share a quip and an affectionate look. As they grow closer, even the formless plot begins to coalesce around them, becoming an unlikely extension of their lives; after Glover and Gibson bond over their memories of Vietnam, it is revealed that the bad guys learned their tricks in Vietnam, too! When the prostitutes are finally out of the picture, Glover's beloved daughter steps into the sexualized victim role. It's absurd stuff, but very neatly and consciously done, and everyone involved commits to it in full.Unfortunately, the film ends with a small misstep. Gary Busey's superhuman villain is a third wheel to Glover and Gibson's relationship. His final, vaguely martial-artsy fight with Gibson strains credulity without adding to the central drama of the cops' friendship and rebirth. Its manufactured excess is one last reminder, though, that Lethal Weapon's filmmakers know how to jazz up a genre picture.

I had forgotten what a great movie this is and really enjoyed myself. It's aged pretty well too except maybe for the annoying score of saxophone music and possibly Mel's cool hair. Well there is that scene with the giant portable phone.Anyways, this is how buddy-cop movies are meant to be; great chemistry between our leads, humorous, without feeling forced, yet also dark and gritty with action scenes that didn't feel like they were just there for the sake of a cool stunt. This also managed to stay away from clichés and the prevalent 80's cheese factor and felt original all the way through. Just a great ride.I was also impressed with how tortured Mel's character 'Martin' is. You genuinely feel his loneliness and pain especially the scene at Christmas with his wife's photo and the hollow point bullet. On a lighter note his original hairstyle gets billing as created by Ramsey in the credits which made me laugh. 07.13 (3) "},{"Title":"Gibson and Glover both made this movie worth watching!","Date":"20 December 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" I don't have too much to say about this movie, but I'll do my best. So here it is Lethal Weapon is basically a buddy cop movie about two mismatched cops working together on a case as they try to put a stop for a bunch of gangs for dealing with drugs on a Christmas holiday. What made this movie work is that both Mel Gibson and Danny Glover work so well together as we buy the chemistry between them; these two wonderful actors are the reason for making this movie worth watching. Gary Busey is a lot of fun as the villain as the rest of the cast all did for what they have to do. Richard Donner does a fine job directing the movie, but I mainly love his work on the first Superman movie as well as the sequel that he never completely finish as he only shot seventy-five percent of the movie if the producer didn't fired him so he can finish it for one hundred percent. The music by Michael Kamen is nothing special, but it is well done. The action in this movie is terrific, and the humor itself is alright. What didn't work is that the movie itself feels kind of slow, and which if they cut some things out so that I feel like I'm watching a fast paced buddy cop movie. That is just me, in my humble opinion. Also, I don't think its the greatest action movie of all time as it takes place around Christmas. So, I guess you can say that I like Die Hard more but I digress. Anyway, like I said, I don't have too much to say about Lethal Weapon, but I do like to say that it is a fun movie, and both Gibson and Glover are wonderful together. I give it an 8 out of 10.

A big reason was that they permitted heavy violence with comical one liners. Another reason though was to pair up two odd ball actors together in one movie. It was a big grab because it allowed for audiences to see interactions between stars that were not normally seen in other genres. Among all the productions that were made, the most popular and critically praised was Richard Donner's Lethal Weapon (1987), the director best known for Superman (1978) and The Goonies (1985) up to that point. Then, attach writer Shane Black to the production and it became an instant hit. Shane Black is the more successful brother of Terry Black, the writer behind Dead Heat (1988).Black's set up to the main story is for the most part like any other buddy cop film. Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) is an older police officer on the force getting close to retirement. Officer Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) is widower who can't be handled by his coworkers. Ever since he lost his wife, Riggs has been on the edge and no one wants to be partnered up with him. That is until he gets assigned to be with Murtaugh. Once Riggs meets Murtaugh, there is initial friction but they soon grow on each other with emotional backstories that are developed enough for the audience to care and understand. Aside from that, both Glover and Gibson give their characters a decent dose of charm. Glover is great at being the tired elderly cop and Gibson is great at being all over the place and bouncing off the walls. These contrasts are fun especially when they share the screen together.There's also a number of supporting actors cast in this movie. Gary Busey and Tom Atkins also have significant roles to play. Tom Atkins plays key a part in a homicide that Riggs and Murtaugh have to figure out. Gary Busey doesn't play a unique individual but makes his performance interesting because he's not all out crazy. He's a bit disturbing but not loony. That's Gibson's role anyway. Sadly there isn't much to say about cinematography or editing. It is competently done though. The cinematographer was Stephen Goldblatt (who might be editor Mark Goldblatt's brother?). The editor was Stuart Baird, who also worked with Donner on Superman (1978). Other than that, there's nothing to say that really stood out. The action was handled well especially when it came to fight sequences. Mel Gibson sure knew how to throw a punch. As for shootings and car chases, nothing there felt special either, I actually expected more. Musically related, Michael Kamen produced the score while collaborating with Eric Clapton. Was it memorable? Ehh,...no not really. However, the sound was different than most scores. This particular score highlighted the most saxophone in it than any other score I've listened too. This made it unique, sadly not enough to remember though. I don't even recall a main theme. However, there were some scenes that were effective - like Mel Gibson's emotional trauma. That worked, but it worked on occasion. It is still a well-made action film no doubt.It has a good cast of actors, fun action and a well-written story. Music and camera-work are good too but nothing to be amazed over. Fun fun.

Gibson and Glover give great performances and show terrific chemistry on screen together. The movie starts out slow, but once the two of them finally pair up, its gold until the end.It's a high octane thrill ride throughout, and the fun part is the back and forth between the leads. I really like that they give a solid back story for both rather than just have them be together in the first few scenes. It's nice when you become invested in the characters when you know why they feel emotionally a certain way. Gibson's character is suicidal and borderline crazy, and Glover is a good family man who just past the mid-century mark. I really like the action scenes, and even in 2014 they pretty much hold up. Now it obviously does have the typical 80's cheesy feel at some parts. But it doesn't diminish the fact that the movie has some depth to it, and isn't just a mindless action thriller.With that said I would have like to see more of the story to the villain side of things. 2 hours is a good length for the film but possibly remove the first few scenes of Gibson just in his trailer and instead give us scenes with Busey. I know the bad guys are involved with drugs but I wanted to get to know those characters more. There are also some parts that seemed a little bit too coincidental, but it is a Hollywood movie. And some parts weren't realistic, I mean the final fight with Gibson and Busey? Would have never been allowed in real life.Still a good film with one of the best cop duos ever captured on screen.

"}{"Title":"Noir immersion","Date":"20 December 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" These films are staples of my generation, it seems hardly a Sunday night would go by without one of them showing up on TV. But upon revisiting them over the past few days, I was surprised to discover that my impression of them was for the most part colored by the sequels and this first one is quite a bit different. It truly is a classic of its time and as good as most comments say, but let's delve a bit deeper.The strength of most films can be broken down to reasons of their individuality and generality, active gestures and underlying environment. The first are always easier to pick out and measure at a glance, in fact most reviews of any film center on these. This is easy to see here in the quirky characters of Riggs and Murtaugh, how Gibson and Glover actively flesh out the chemistry. Around them we have a perfectly competent action vessel for them to act out in.That's fine, this chemistry is what they relied on to create the franchise, building it up to a family. But I believe the film works - and is significantly different to the sequels - as much for their active presence as due to a presence of another sort.The first thing to note is that here we have the transition from film noir more clearly than any other film I can recall right now. The story begins with detectives on a case, cops. We are in a noir LA, Chandler's evocation of it suburban money, prostitution, sleepless nights of drifting. The crime is a murder that would have been murder had the girl not leaped first from a balcony to her death, wonderfully worthy of the jazz causality of film noir. The transition from noir is that our detectives do the same suburban snooping around that Marlowe would do, but at every stop it erupts into gunfire and fireballs. The world no longer fiddles its noir machinations of mystery and self, but explodes, disappearing. You'll notice that by the end we don't get as much as a vague suggestion about her suicide, but we have the whole plan explained about the murder and drug trafficking plot. The causality is flattened. But the investigation itself still charms because it carries that sultry jazz echo of noir.Which brings me to the main thing I bring up in many other comments, the experience of immersion. The transition is from noir into action, from that generality which in pure noir appears as an ambiguous fabric of fate where the ordinary schmuck finds himself enmeshed, where space throbs with a mystery, to the straighforward individuality of the action film where space is a material backdrop for acting out. The transition means we get to see both.When Murtaugh first arrives at the murder scene by morning, we have a marvelous shot of him on the street looking up at that fateful balcony, our eye engulfed in bright light from above. Moments later, he's in the apartment ruminating as curtains flutter around him in the wind. The shot introducing us to Riggs' place covers first a vast stretch of beach. The first shot that introduces the villains, that whole lighter in the arm scene, is shot beneath a wonderful constellation of light bulbs.None of these shots are held for longer than the story has use for them, it's not that kind of film. But it's truly evocative, truly reflective about staring into the night ahead, because it is always anchored in an underlying space with presence. We have Murtaugh contemplating a life without all these things, on a boat, and that boat is stationed on his front lawn. You have some evidence of all this at work by looking at the much thinner sequels. The villains and plot are as ridiculous, but they bring Riggs and Murtaugh much more to the front, ignoring the noir and spatiality.Noir disappeared in TV shows and cop films like this, which fooled around with the plots or appearances, but these were never the main shaping forces of noir. Its essence is preserved and taken further by someone like Lynch, entirely about that prelogical point in the story when it is still both a murder and a suicide.

The film is directed by Dick Donner (Superman, The Omen, The Goonies) who does a good job of balancing the comedy and the drama. He would go on to direct Gibson in 3 more Lethal Weapons and two additional movies as well. Lethal Weapon is one of my all time favorite movies. Its a movie a guy's guy can enjoy.

JJ's Verdict Lethal Weapon has a confused and a little twisted plot. In most films I would be criticising it for this. But in Lethal Weapon, story is rightfully placed behind the right to entertain the audience with Riggs and Murtaugh &#x96; the best cop partnership cinema has had to offer.In Lethal Weapon, we are introduced to Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh who have just been paired together to investigate the suicide of a young woman after she jumped off her balcony. In Riggs we have a young, confident cop but extremely psychotic and suicidal and in Murtaugh, a reserved old-timer and family man who is just too old for this s***. The pair discover the girl died after being poisoned through drugs and have to try and investigate a gang of drug dealers while also trying to stand one and other.Lethal Weapon is plot thin. It mainly revolves around Riggs and Murtaugh chasing drug dealers and with this premise most would expect a textbook formulaic action film. Luckily this isn't what they get, mainly down to writer Shane Black. His script is sharp and full of witty lines and contains two superb characters. Put together with director Richard Donner's brilliant flair for directing both actors and action scenes, it is action and cop-buddy heaven. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover work so well together and (Gibson especially) both become completely immersed in their characters. Despite their characters being complete opposites, as a viewer you kind of want to be both. Gibson's Riggs is a total loner and has a tendency to go completely psycho and watching the Aussie contemplate suicide and then just go bonkers with a gun is an absolute joy to watch. Danny Glover's Murtaugh is less showy than Gibson and without much study you would probably just say he did fine. But Glover's attention to small details in his acting is brilliant and little moments where he worries about his age are, at times, heart breaking. The rest of the cast includes singer Darlene Love in a sweet performance as Mrs. Murtaugh and Gary Busey, who is very good as primary villain, Mr. Joshua.The action is brilliantly choreographed, and each set piece is very intense. A few that standout in particular is the wild-west-like shootout towards the end, the bar shootout and of course the epic punch-off finale between Riggs and Joshua. Most of the actor did their own stunts in the film and each of them certainly put in their all to look well-trained in these scenes-and trust me, they do.Its plot is a little too simple but that isn't the appeal here. The appeal is Gibson and Glover, having brilliant banter, learning to trust the other, killing bad guys and just having fun. This is entertainment at its very best.

Gibson, in his mainstream American breakthrough, is particularly good as unhinged, suicidal cop Martin Riggs, who always seems to have a pit of emotion raging behind his wide, unsettling gaze. Of course, it's an action movie from right in the heart of the genre's heyday, so there's no shortage of fireballs, gunshots, abandoned warehouses or furiously flying fists, but its big heart, strong core relationship and generally-grounded approach to the big fight scenes keep it from feeling overly indulgent.

Riggs and Murtaugh now must figure out how to work together and solve the case while at the same time try to get to know one another and figure each other out and Murtaugh get used to Riggs as a Lethal Weapon.Lethal Weapon is one of those Action movie classics that made me fall in love with the Action genre and gave viewers an introduction to one of the greatest film screen duos of all time Riggs and Murtaugh and a masterful introduction to the amazing Lethal Weapon series. Right from the opening credits to the end you are glued to the screen because of the Action,thrills,suspense and memorable characters in the film. I think that one of the reasons Lethal Weapon is such a brilliant film is because the film took the Buddy cop concept of the Action-Comedy Walter Hill classic 48 Hrs and flipped it and instead of being the cop and criminal this time both are cops. It's no coincidence that both Lethal Weapon and 48 Hrs were both co-produced by Joel Silver. Where as the other Lethal Weapon sequels we're light and much more comedic,LW1 is more gritty and dark because LW1 while an Action is also a great character study of Riggs and Murtaugh because the film shows that Riggs is depressed and on the verge of suicide while Murtaugh has to deal with getting older and his new partner Riggs. And while LW is a serious Action film there are moments of funny humor but the Humor is done in a cynical tone and the comedy is not as over the top as the sequels. LW in some way bridged a gap between the Action films of the 70s and 80s and the early 90s by being serious with a dark sense of Humor. That being said I love all of the LW films. The screenplay by Shane Black is brilliant and excellent,well-written and one of the best Action screenplays of all time with Black giving the main characters memorable dialog with some dark humor and giving the two main characters powerful depth. Black would continue writing brilliant Action scripts with Lethal Weapon 2,The Last Boy Scout,The Long Kiss Goodnight and Kiss,Kiss,Bang,Bang. Riggs and Murtaugh are classic characters of Action films and cinema in general. Like any great Action buddy film,Riggs and Murtaugh at first don't like each other and it's not only because the two don't want to work with one another it's also because of how opposite the two are. Riggs is more wild and filled with energy where as Murtaugh is more straight and narrow but as the film goes on Riggs and Murtaugh begin to understand and like each other. Riggs and Murtaugh feel like real characters who not stereotypes but real people that viewers can relate to. It is the difference between the characters that makes Riggs and Murtaugh so great and entertaining and the banter and dialog makes this film and the other LW films so amazing and watchable. I also love the villains in the film and despite the villains not having much screen time they are vicious and dark in the way they do things and leave a huge impression. The film moves at a great pace and never slows down once the Action kicks into high gear The Action scenes in the film are excellent and handled with intensity and white hot suspense and the Action scenes would get better and bigger as the LW films went on. The final 20-30 minutes are among the best endings that you will see in a Action film and it is so thrilling and Action packed that you will barely have time to catch your breath. It is an excellent ending that will stay in you after the film is over and will put a smile on viewers faces.The whole cast is great in their roles. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are excellent and at their best as Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh,with Gibson and Glover bringing depth,intensity and great chemistry to their roles.

Amazing direction by Donner.The score by Eric Clapton and Michael Kamen is masterful,powerful and one of the best scores in an Action film. A great score by Clapton and Kamen. I also loved the use of the classic Christmas song Jingle Bell Rock by Bobby Helms.In final word if you love Action films,Thrillers or films in general I highly suggest you see Lethal Weapon,a masterful start to a great series and a unforgettable Action classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

This movie combines high tense action with humor that makes you want to see more of these guys, as it ends you just find yourself desiring that it didn't. From the very beginning this casting was set from someone high in heaven, because according to Wikipedia Casting director Marion Dougherty first casting suggestion was Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, which ended up being what we saw on screen.They were both like a diamond in a rock, one an all-round good guy with a family man consisting of 3 children and the other a widower with suicidal intentions and nothing to live for until he met the first. These were Murtaugh and Riggs respectively and if you think you can cross any of these guys and just walk away&#x85; you got another thing coming.The first of the four series is this one which was released in 1987; it stands as the introduction piece of how Murtaugh and Riggs met, and how they bonded. Murtaugh (Danny Glover) at that time was 50 years of age enjoying the life of being a straight shooter cop until he got partnered with a younger suicidal cop Riggs (38 at that time) (Mel Gibson) who no one wants to work with. Now both guys who are like a mix of crazy and normal must learn to work with one another to stop a gang of drug smugglers.As easy as this may sound on paper it wasn't on screen, as we get to go through scenes after scenes of both parties ready to do what it takes to get the job done. The music score in this movie is one that you will love as it was done by Michael Kamen and Eric Clapton. The Jazz feel is just exquisite, moving ahead my favorite scene in the movie; Spoiler Alert is where Riggs convinced a man that was going to jump to appreciate living. He did this by making the man live up to his word when he was threatening to jump, Riggs made him jump.After this the duo went ahead to make 3 other films similar to this and they from my point of view were just as beautiful as this one was.www.lagsreviews.com "},{"Title":"Great 80's Action Film!","Date":"2 January 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Tom Atkins, Gary Busey, Mitch Ryan, Darlene Love, Jackie Swanson and Traci Wolfe star in Richard Donner's 1987 action film.

The action in the film is great as was the cinematography until the final fight between Riggs and Joshua, which I say was a great fight but the camera movement was all over the place.

Next to her on a table with drugs situated on top. The young lady gets up to sniff the drugs, then walks outside to the balcony, leans toward the railing and take her fatal plunge to her death.Mel Gibson was flat-out excellent as mentally unbalanced cop Det. Martin Riggs. As he combines his versatility as both a strong action hero and a lovable clown. Using both his charm and charisma, Riggs is probably one of the most endearing characters in film history. As a man who's perpetually grief-stricken after the death of his wife in a fatal automobile accident, Riggs has been living an unsettling life. Hell go far as to dare someone dangerous to kill him, even if its just for kicks. Many times Riggs tries to kill himself. With the assistance of his .9 mm. Beretta, he places the gun into his mouth and attempts to pull the trigger. Other attempts of suicidal tendencies is when another hes on top of a building and another jumper is nearby. He places one part of a handcuff on the jumpers wrist and another on his wrist as he gracefully throws the key in the air. As a unstable gunman, he fires shots without blinking claiming that killing was the only thing he could do well.Riggs joins forcing with a reluctant ageing African-American police detective Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) to explore further investigation to the suicide of the young lady who fell to her death, which puts the dynamic duo in the centre of a major drug bust. Glover is equally effective and is known for stealing every scene he's in. Murtaugh is from the old-school of investigating as he is fixated on retirement but prefers to play by the rules rather than take risks like his partner Riggs. Pushing towards 50, Murtaugh wants to just forget about his achievements he's accomplished as an investigator and wants to spend time with his family.When news gets around that his daughter has been kidnapped, Murtaugh bites his tongue and goes along with Riggs risky ways in order to get his daughter back. Gary Busey is Mr. Joshua,a cold-blooded evil drug-lord who's also has had experience as a Vietnam vet. Joshua will go to any lengths necessary into how much the cops know about his drug rings. His boss General Peter MacAllister (Mitchell Ryan) who looks even more menacing than Joshua like as though he has icicles running through his veins. The evil general turns up the crank in the investigation by ordering Murtaugh to be annihilated and in the process kidnaps his adorable daughter Rianne (Traci Wolfe) in order for Murtaugh to speak. Director Richard Donner this movie combines plenty of bone-chilling action, great humour and brilliant acting by the cast. This goes beyond all expectancies from a cop-drama. The final action scenes pit Riggs and Murtaugh against the General and his goons features some of the best choreographed fight scenes ever put on film.

"},{"Title":"Even in 2037, the film will not be too old for Cinema ...","Date":"18 September 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" It's hard to believe that Roger Murtaugh and Martin Riggs started driving up together 25 years ago, and I'm not expressing nostalgia here, only complimenting the timeless appeal of a film that stood the test of time. Because, as much as it carries the visible mark of the 80's, there's a level of freshness and modernity that elevates Lethal Weapon above any of todays productions. And not just as a classic cop/thriller, Lethal Weapon will forever be regarded as the film to that epitomizes the 'buddy-movie'.Generally, this sub-genre's main premise relies on the coexistence of two polar opposite personalities within a unity of space, time and plot, and whatever happens, the friendship or growing complicity between the two leads remains the plot's center of gravity. While not a golden rule, it's assumed that the more different they are, the funnier get the interactions, and the closer they are, the more serious it gets. I guess that a good buddy-movie should find the correct balance between The Odd Couple and The Defiant Ones. And Lethal Weapon works like a school case, the relationship between Danny Glover and Mel Gibson could serve as the best reference for any buddy movie, regardless of the genre, the tone or the style.Richard Donner, who directedSuperman and The Goonies already proved to be capable of making action films where characters were more than tools to build a story. In Lethal Weapon, he surpasses himself by providing two remarkable examples of great characterizations. Indeed, instead of taking for granted the necessity of having two different cops and throwing it at our faces &#x96;for instance, after a stereotypical set-up where one of them loses his partner- he takes time to present the two leads. And when they meet, they're familiar enough to us, to make us care for them equally, and that's a key element no one serves as a foil to the other, no lead and sidekick, Glover and Gibson are complementary to the core. And that's because they have more in common than they think and each one has a potential to fill the other's life-gap.Lethal Weapon opens with Danny Glover as a man who just turned 50, the father or three kids, one beautiful daughter, and like every man his age, he's concerned by his gray facial hair, can't find the car keys or can't tell his wife what he thinks of her cooking. His motto I'm to old for this ----summarizes the attitude that govern 95% of his life. And Mel Gibson plays a relatively young, long-haired, sharpshooter who became suicidal after his wife's death. Three key scenes sum up his 'pathos', he confronts a nervous sniper without taking any protection, he challenges a thug who took him as a hostage, and in one of the most emotionally engaging scenes, he tries to kill himself by pointing a gun in many spots in his face before giving up, his face covered of tears. By the way, the level of emotion Mel Gibson manages to pull in these 3 minutes is Oscar-worthy.Basically, Roger Murtaugh is in a routinely logic while Martin Riggs is in a dead-end, one is exceptionally ordinary; another is so tormented no one wants to work with him. It's astonishing how never, and I mean, never in the film, they seem stereotypical. As I described, when they start working together, we identify to each one of them, and try to figure how they can complete each other. Yet they do, because on their own, they're two lonely men, one absorbed by his family life, and another stuck to the only thing that keeps him for blowing his brain off his job. Riggs is good and he knows it, is Murtaugh as good? Well, he lasted long enough without getting a bullet, or a scratch, and he contemplates retirement like Riggs suicide. Both are in a sort of transitional time of their life, in a tunnel where the most needful element to enlighten their lives is a buddy.And that's what makes the film so great, while we enjoy the countless action scenes and the investigation, we also have a good time watching them having some beer, commenting on the wife's food or the crush the cute daughter has on Riggs. Riggs' wisecracking comments and Murtaugh's excitability are the spices that provide the film (and the sequels) its entire savor. Of course, I'm not making Lethal Weapon sound like a character study but granted it's a great action/cop thriller with some heart-pounding sequences, there's more to it definitely, something in the same vein, than Die Hard that renewed the action genre. I guess the audience needed less superheroes or modern lone rider's type and needed to identify with the characters before getting immersed in their universe and caring for them not just because they're labeled as heroes.It's not surprising that Lehtal Weapon and Die Hard take place in L.A. during Christmas, the context doesn't play as a pivotal role in Lethal Weapon but it does provide this natural ordinary setting that, by contrast, make the action scenes more challenging. Naturally, the impact and entertaining value of an action film also relies on the presence of a great villain. Lethal Weapon manages to do so with the unforgettable third pillar of the film, Gary Busey as 'Mr. Joshua', although he doesn't have the same sophistication than Hans Gruber, he's genuinely scary and impressive enough to be a perfect match for Riggs and Murtaugh.What else to say about Lethal Weapon? Well, it created the most endearing cinematic duo of the recent years, and although the film slides sometimes into some stereotypes, it still remains one of the greatest of its genre, with a genuine human quality. And I'm sure that even in 2037, the film will never be too old for Cinema.

Mel Gibson and Danny Glover star as two cops who reluctantly work together to stop a group of drug smugglers. They have wildly different personalities that are constantly clashing, as are their methods of doing the same job. Gibson plays Martin Riggs, an unhinged officer with suicidal tendencies, while Glover plays Roger Murtagh, a family man and a veteran cop. The two make a charming pair that make for a fun and explosively entertaining film.Lethal Weapon is very simple and very straightforward. It is, after all, just a formula film. There's nothing astounding or jaw dropping about the film, but it is a lot of fun. It's the quintessential buddy cop film, no matter how standard and ordinary the buddy cop genre is. The story about drug smugglers brings nothing new to the table. It's very simple, but thankfully not dull.All that a good buddy cop movie can really depend on is the chemistry in its two leads, as there's not much more going for this genre most of the time. Lethal Weapon succeeds on this front. Gibson and Glover are great together. Their characters are believable and seeing them work together is a lot of fun. It's clear they had a fun time working on the film together as they give their respective performances their all. I have zero respect for Mel Gibson these days for obvious reasons, but I was even able to find him enjoyable in this film. He and Glover are excellent, and are essentially the only thing that makes Lethal Weapon a worthwhile watch.If you love buddy cop movies then this is a must see. If you're indifferent towards the genre, like me, then you may or may not want to invest two hours of your life towards Lethal Weapon. I have no regrets, but I couldn't see myself watching this film again.

The funny thing is that those ideas come by pair of oppositesFirst, the buddy movie the old timer teams up with a crazy hotshot and the mix is explosive. The former calm and dull pavilion life will be changed forever. The magic comes here from its formidable casting because Glover and Gibson fit the part like glove. Next, the big violent criminals and sexual arousal it's evident here that the shootings and fights are more brutal that those we have previously seen in similar movies. The kills rise high as well as the nudity scenes (it's not a erotic movie but you see that the prude veil is starting to come down at the release). However, the pill passes up as this content is blended with very familial content as well and comedy.Now, the complicated and very unbelievable plots as they laugh themselves of it (it's thin, anorexic), the crime story isn't original or inventive but the movie is speedy, nervous and dynamic (maybe it's even a bit too fast because the edit is sometimes clumsy look for the handcuffs just before the big jump or count the shots and compare them with the card!). Like the casting, Donner has been a good choice because he knows how to tell a story.At last, in this first movie, the more unexpected opposition comes to shoot the movie in LA at Christmas time. It's very unusual to see that and the movie has a good atmosphere coming from the Californian sun and the Christmas decorations!Quickly, a good mention goes to the daughter that I have unfortunately never saw in other big movies and to the late Nick Kamen who scored a very bluesy score that helps define the mood of the movie.As you have understood, it's a really good movie, full of juice and laughs and that calls for more!

A great film in general? Maybe, maybe not. But plenty of fights, guns, dark humor, and enough memorable scenes that this film has been parodied far too many times. Perhaps it was parodied best on Always Sunny. The Chinese torture scene? Classic. The line about being too old? Everybody knows that line.Gary Busey has said this is the film that revived his career. Oddly enough, I do not think Busey's role is all that memorable. Sure, he is the primary villain, but he does not do much to make himself more than the average bad guy. Today, his craziness has far eclipsed his role here and he is now remembered as the crazy guy rather than the villain from Lethal Weapon. Oh well.Upon repeat viewings, the film gets better and better, and really exemplifies what was right about 1980s action films.

Murtaugh is a Sergeant who just celebrated his 50th birthday and a happy family man, whilst Riggs had just lost his wife in a car accident and has become suicidal. Both are good officers but have very different styles Murtaugh is much more safer in his approach to Riggs as a maverick. The two are forced together after Riggs was transferred and the two are assigned to investigate the death of a prostitute. But it quickly turns out that the death was linked to a drugs ring, run by the General (Mitchell Ryan) and his loyal henchman Mr. Joseph (Gary Busey).Lethal Weapon was a film that was able to mixed a serious plot that could have worked in a thriller or police film, with strong, light-hearted relationship between Glover and Gibson. The plot is played straight and has moments of darkness, whilst the characters themselves were a bit more comic because of Murtaugh's domestic situation and Riggs' crazy personality. But this film was played to be pretty serious for the most part.Shane Black writes a very good script and with Richard Donner's direction the action is constant. Donner knew when to slow the film down to allow the characters to shine. With a good score and traditional action techniques Donner makes an exciting and fun film but the final fight scene was a bit disappointing. Donner kept a fast pacing so it was hard to get bored with a film like this. But Lethal Weapon is Donner's best film since The Omen (I am including Superman). Black avoided clichés that plagued the genre later on, like the dressing down by the police captain or the main two characters hating each other and then becoming friends. Murtaugh and Riggs do have a chalk and cheese relationship, but they never hate each other. They learn from each other and the relationship was natural in the film's internal reality. The plot itself was as mentioned, dark and in the right level between believable but just enough to keep a level of fantasy which was needed for this type of film.The key to the film was the interaction between Glover and Gibson who worked well together. Glover was more natural and deadpan in his approach whilst Gibson was more over the time. The acting is decent for the most part.An enjoyable film. "},{"Title":"Entertaining Tough Cop Thriller","Date":"26 June 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" Given that police detectives often work in pairs, it is surprising how long it took the film industry to come up with the buddy cop movie. In the Heat of the Night is a rare example from the sixties, but most of the tough cop dramas from that decade and from the seventies were about loners who preferred to work alone. Even when the likes of Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry were paired with another detective, the focus was very much on the title character with his partner playing a minor role. 48 Hours is sometimes classed as a buddy cop film, but in fact Nick Nolte's detective was teamed not with another police officer but with a convict temporarily released from jail.The buddy cop genre probably came of age with the Lethal Weapon series, of which this is the first. Two LAPD detectives, Roger Murtaugh and Martin Riggs, are assigned to investigate the apparent suicide of a young woman named Amanda Hunsaker, who turns out to be the daughter of one of Murtaugh's old buddies from the Vietnam War. Upon investigation it becomes clear that her death was in fact murder and that those responsible are a ruthless gang of drug dealers, all themselves Vietnam veterans. Amanda was killed because her banker father Michael, who acted as the gang's money-launderer, was threatening to alert the police to the scheme.What lifts Lethal Weapon above the average is not its plot or its action sequences, which are all very much standard shoot-e-mail-up stuff, but the characterisation of the two main roles. A common feature of buddy cop films is that the two partners are normally very different in character. They initially start off disliking one another, but this dislike eventually turns to mutual respect, even friendship. As in In the Heat of the Night one of the two is black, the other white. In the earlier film, which used the conventions of the police thriller to explore the problem of racism in American society, this racial difference is the most important element in the film; here it does not really matter, something which shows how America had changed in the twenty years between 1967 and 1987. The film would still be much the same if Riggs were black and Murtaugh white, or if both were of the same race. The important differences are not of race but of temperament.Murtaugh, as played by Danny Glover, is the older of the two, having recently celebrated his 50th birthday. He is also the more stable, a happily married family man. Mel Gibson's Riggs, by contrast, is depressed and suicidal following the death of his wife in a car crash. Murtaugh wants to play everything by the book, whereas Riggs prefers more uncompromising methods of law enforcement. He was originally attached to the drugs squad, but was transferred to homicide by his superiors who are weary of his violent behaviour. Riggs has some similarities with Harry Callahan, another widower who lost his wife to a car accident; the main difference is that the unpredictable Riggs lacks Harry's icy self-control.Along with Die Hard, made the following year, Lethal Weapon launched a second generation of tough cop movies. (Bruce Willis, who plays John McClane in the Die Hard series, was originally considered for the role of Riggs). Like most tough cop films (the original Dirty Harry perhaps being an exception), it does not ask any very deep questions, but does at least provide some good entertainment with some exciting action sequences. 6/10 "},{"Title":"Lethal Weapon","Date":"15 June 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" One of the best action movies of the 80's.

I could have found the film absolutely stunning, which I didn't, but for the most part, it is an impressive buddy cop movie.Roger Murtaugh (Glover) has been working for the L.A.P.D. for quite a long time, and has just reached his 50th birthday. He is informed of the death of Amanda Hunsaker, who fell from her apartment. She was the daughter of Michael Hunsaker, a man who was friends with Roger when they fought in Vietnam, but they haven't seen each other in twelve years. So, the L.A.P.D. detective is assigned to investigate, and is assigned a partner for this investigation, a younger L.A.P.D. detective named Martin Riggs (Gibson). Riggs has been mentally unstable and suicidal since the death of his wife in an accident, and he takes unusually high risks while on the job! It turns out that Amanda was poisoned, so the two cops are to find out who is responsible. Their mission, which won't be made any easier by their conflicting personalities, leads them to a group of drug-smuggling mercenaries! Not everything about this movie thoroughly impressed me. The intro is a bit bland, showing a moving overhead view through the city put to Jingle Bell Rock. It then goes to Amanda Hunsaker, showing the character on her fateful night, and this sequence also could have been done better. Jackie Swanson didn't do the best job in this very brief role, even though she apparently performed her own stunt, which was obviously an accomplishment. So, there may be some dull moments, but to make up for that, there is a lot of action and suspense, and while the dialogue may be flawed at times, I've heard worse. So many people have praised this film for the two leads, and I'm going to have to join them. Danny Glover and Mel Gibson do make a good team, both playing memorable characters with depth. (Yes, I know I'm not the first to point that out.) Putting a lot of action in a movie isn't necessarily going to make it good, but with the two leads, along with some humour, Lethal Weapon doesn't rely entirely on action for entertainment value. For that reason, I can see why this 1987 blockbuster was such a big hit.

Lethal Weapon, so successful that it became four films over ten years, is two things that one doesn't read from the tagline a buddy movie and a Mel Gibson vehicle.Riggs lives an existentially toxic cocktail of loneliness and dealing with bad guys and consequently gets transferred out to work with an old-timer, Murtaugh, who just wants to get down to being a family man. Despite the inevitable early suspicions, a homicide too close to Murtaugh's heart and his own tolerance towards the wild but gifted Riggs means the two come together. A routine but well-prepared action movie follows culminating in an unforgettable, emotional showdown outside Murtaugh's home into which Riggs has become adopted.Lethal Weapon kicked off at about the same time as Die Hard. Whilst generically and narratively only distantly related, the relatively young but wisecrackingly weary antihero was an instant success in both. Danny Glover is clearly a straight guy for Gibson's manic, physical Riggs, masculine, entertaining but pitiful. It's a winning formula and performance. 7/10 "},{"Title":"undeniable","Date":"8 November 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" This is a wonderful movie.

Riggs and Murtaugh (Gibson and Glover) are undeniably one of the top duos of all time. After all, their chemistry was spectacular enough to bring about three more sequels. But why does the aging, skeptical black man work well with the younger, reckless, suicidal white guy? It's this huge contrast that reaches a wide audience.Because of how different they are, both heroes connect to everyone, but it's really more about how they are one person split in two. We all have a more grounded perception of our lives and our jobs like Murtaugh, but there is a part of us that wants to live on the edge and do things the bold way. That's the whole idea behind Shane Black's script and he sums it up well at the end. Of course it didn't hurt that he had one of the greatest directors of that decade bringing his work to life. Richard Donner is about as solid as you can get when it comes to action. While some of the scenes are definitely please keep this locked up in the 80s material, Donner does a lot to show you just how similar Riggs and Murtaugh are with camera angles and shots that compare them similarly.The plot is really only a vehicle for these characters to interact. It seems like every time the two go somewhere they are launched directly into an action sequence. There is no set up, no tension building; something merely explodes or suddenly there's a helicopter and a guy shooting at them. It's kind of ridiculous and the bad guys as a result seem way out in left- field, but the point is just how Murtaugh and Riggs respond to all these events and how they're changed. We just get to enjoy some great 80s gunfights along the way.

Lethal Weapon is the pinnacle of Cop movies.  It's the be all and end all.  It truly is an outstanding action/suspense/thriller movie.  The thing about this movie that really blows me away is how many different things it covers.  It's NOT just a blow things up action movie, the characters are very deep, and their stories are interesting, the plot is excellent.  On top of the action you have incredible comedy.  One liners, and catch phrases that are just brilliantly written.  Of course there are always things that can be critisized about every movie.  I don't suppose that two cops could truly run around a city shooting and killing every bad guy they come across...or a cop could dive off a building with a suicidal man and not get fired, or arrested himself.  But who cares...it's fun.  It's not meant to be reality or a cop training video (unless you're the LAPD...gratuitous low blow)  Gary Busey is of course great as the killer mercenary, and the big bad boss drug dealer (that guy from Dharma and Greg) played the perfect bad guy.  This movie doesn't leave much for improvement but it does leave you begging for more Riggs and Murtaugh.  Mel Gibson is perfect.  Martin Riggs had to be one of the greatest movie characters of all times.  It's astonishing how much feeling they put into Riggs who is a man who has lost his wife in a car accident and is just begging for death to take him.  He's suicidal and on the edge and it makes him look psycotic.  He is partnered with Lt. Murtaugh, played by Danny Glover.  A cop who is nearing retirement, who plays by the rules and has a perfect family life.  Together they make the perfect team.  Gibson and Glover have the ideal chemistry and their characters, completely different, help each other in every way.  Murtaugh learns a lesson in letting loose and not being quite so uptight and Riggs learns to love life and finds himself with a surrogate family in the form of the Murtaughs.  The movie spends so much time introducing us into the lives of these two men...how different they are, and how much they needed each other.  Together they find themselves the perfect team to taking out a ruthless drug operation.  The action comes in the ending scenes, the last 45 minutes has to be one of the perfectly filmed action sequences in movie history.  Mel Gibson battling it out with Gary Busey, hand to hand, under the spouting water of a decapitated Fire Hydrant is brilliant and heart stopping.  The fight scenes were flawless.

However, in 1987, he returned with a new look and a new, hard-hitting role in LETHAL WEAPON, a gritty, violent police thriller, directed by veteran Richard Donner (SUPERMAN, THE GOONIES) and co-starring Danny Glover, then relatively unknown. Everybody knows the plot - mentally disturbed LA 'tec, Martin Riggs (Gibson), depressed over his wife's death, a former Vietnam killing machine and who doesn't care if he lives or dies, is teamed up with stable family man, the laid-back Roger Murtaugh (Glover). Initially, Murtaugh is reluctant to have this 'lethal weapon' at his side, but gradually, they bond when CIA-trained drugrunners kidnap Roger's daughter and the two cops have to fight their way out of a deadly situation.  The first Lethal Weapon was definitely the best. Like the original Dirty Harry, it was a character study of its main character, a man on the edge, not afraid to kill anybody in the line of duty, in fact all the more willing to do it so that he can lash out his inner demons. He is also a loner, because of his dangerous attitude, nobody will go near him, not even Murtaugh, but as they slowly get to know each other, they do reach an understanding and Riggs' suicidal thoughts are momentarily put aside, because he's finally found someone he can relate to, and the fact that Murtaugh has a family. As an action thriller, LW works efficiently. The way the two cops relate a whore's death to a drug-smuggling operation involving Vietnam veterans is maybe a little far fetched, almost like a TV cop series episode, but Richard Donner keeps the action tight. Before LW, there were a whole load of actioners starring Sly, Arnie, Bronson and Norris where the good guy kills loads of bad guys with not even a scratch. In this movie which sort of paved the way for DIE HARD (both were produced by Joel silver), the heroes are ordinary human beings who are shot, tortured, electrocuted and able to express their feelings. There are scenes where Riggs is crying over a photo of his dead wife and Murtaugh curses and weeps when his captors prise his daughter away from him. Can you imagine Arnie and Sly doing that? Maybe Stallone could've done with the right script ( in Rocky 2 & 3 and First Blood, there were emotional scenes involving his characters).This is what lifted Lethal Weapon above the movies of the same ilk that came before it.

Lethal Weapon has one of my favourite directors of all time as well, making this movie quite a treat.Martin Riggs is no ordinary cop. He's a Mad Max gone maniacal, a man whose killing expertise and suicidal recklessness make him a Lethal Weapon to anyone he works against. Or with. Roger Murtaugh is an easy going homicide detective with a loving family, a big house and a pension he doesn't want to lose. Imagine Murtaugh's shock when he learns his new partner is a guy with nothing left to lose wild-eyed, burnt-out Martin Riggs. Lethal Weapon is the thrill-packed story of two Vietnam-vets-turned-cops who have just one thing in common both hate to work with partners. But their partnership becomes the key to survival when a routine murder investigation leads to all-out, take-no-prisoners, martial-arts-and machine-guns war with an international heroin ring.  Well there are no queries from me about the cast of this film. Australian actor Mel Gibson shows his true talent in this action classic. He played Martin Riggs, the suicidal cop and borderline psychopath who's on the edge, perfectly. I love it how Riggs acts first and thinks second. Mel's career has been very illustrious, with films including Gallipoli, Mad Max, Maverick (alongside Jodie Foster), Braveheart, Payback and The Patriot. Then you take Rigg's partner Murtaugh played by veteran actor Danny Glover. His role would have been hard to find, and Glover filled the void beautifully. Glover has appeared in films like The colour purple and voiced characters in in cartoon movies like Antz and Prince of Egypt. Plus had a cameo role in the Maverick. The bad guy of credit in this movie is Gary Busey. He suited his role well. The boss's best tough man and I love the way his character shows no regard for anyone. Busey has some impressive films on the C.V., like Under Siege, Dropzone, and The Firm. This movie has some great scenes. The start is very powerful and keeps you enthralled to what is to come. Then there is some great action and a bit of fun. The scene with the most humour and then tension would have to be when Riggs approaches a man on the edge of a building. Then you have the explosions at the house of the prostitute who is the one person that can help our duo's investigation. But there is a point in this film where it ups the pace and never stops till virtually the end. I just loved the conclusion, with all the macho fighting which was great.I want to praise the work of veteran director Richard Donner on Lethal Weapon. I love this movie for his touch of class. There is nothing in this movie that I can dispute and the direction he took the audience on was great. I praised Donner in my review of the original Superman movie and enjoyed his touch in the 1985 adventure, The Goonies. Like Superman, without Donner in the director's chair for Lethal Weapon, it would not have been as greater film as it is. Lastly, the onscreen chemistry between Glover and Gibson is one of the things that won me over to this movie, plus some of the quotes in this film are hilarious. If you are fan of this film you are in for a treat, considering there are sequels to follow. So if you are Hollywood movie fan, put this movie at the top of your list, coz I know I have it up there somewhere in mine.I will never be too old for this S#*T!Rating 4 Stars or 9/10   "},{"Title":"My number 147 movies","Date":"7 February 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":"  Lethal Weapon , part 1 is my number 147 movie.

Personally, my favorite has always been Die Hard (1988) and considering some of the action movies we have been able to see quite recently, it always will be.  However, Lethal Weapon is another movie that I would consider as a good action movie.  It isn't Die Hard, but it's pretty close and having been released one year before Die Hard, I give it credit for its styles which we can find in all of the Lethal Weapon movies.  These styles are a blend of action and comedy and a few emotional moments which keep the movie going and do not throw it off track.       Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) is a cop who is very suicidal and whom many think is crazy.  He lives alone in his broken down trailer with no other friend than his guard dog.  During the day, he works undercover busting drug dealers or as a normal cop but doing crazy things like jumping off a roof with a man who had intended to do that in the first place.  On the other side, we have detective Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover), an investigative cop who has just turned fifty.  Roger is married and father of three.   This is the set-up for the movie or as some people might call it, the excuse for allowing the movie to be.  The only thing is, these two men will have to meet one day if director Richard Donner wants his movie to be.  And this is where the emotional part of the movie comes in.  One night, in his trailer, Riggs brings his gun to his mouth and the only thing that keeps him from pulling the trigger is the picture of his wife who is deceased.  It seems to be the reason he wants to pull the trigger so that he may join her, but it also seems to keep him from shooting himself.  On the other side, detective Murtaugh is investigating the death of a prostitute who turns out to be the daughter of a friend with whom he served in Vietnam.  However, after the autopsy of the dead girl, the apparent suicide seems to be a murder case after all.  At this point, the two men have not met but they will quite soon.  Riggs is assigned to Murtaugh as his new partner.  The two of them quickly meet when Murtaugh assaults Riggs when he takes out his gun in the police precinct believing Riggs was about to attack the department.  Murtaugh soon realizes that his partner is a mad man and might get him killed while they work.  Riggs, on the other hand, sees nothing crazy whatsoever in what manners he uses to defend himself or his partner as long as he gets the job done.  For him, that is the only thing that counts considering the fact that Riggs realizes he is suicidal.  There is a very intense scene in which Murtaugh is trying to push Riggs over the edge telling him he should kill himself for he believes Riggs is not willing to do it.  But he realizes, just like the viewer, that Riggs is very willing and that he shouldn't tempt him.  The comedy sets in after the two of them meet and this is what makes this movie so unique.  In Die Hard, we saw Bruce Willis making wisecracks every now and then which allowed the movie to be more relaxing and all the more entertaining.  In Lethal Weapon however, the two actors make jokes and funny remarks about their age, Glover's family, and many other subjects all along the movie which gives it a cool rhythm and a nice flow.      Danny Glover seems to be one of the best actors they could have gotten for the job of Murtaugh as he delivers the goods and gives his now famous line I'm too old for this s*** quite often.  But Gibson is the only man there was for the role of Riggs.  He steals the movie with his tough uncaring attitude of wether he dies on the job or not.  His attitude in the movie is comparable to Connery's in The Untouchables (1987) as he is ready to do anything as long as that gets the job done.  Fnally, the only thing missing to complete the cast is the bad guy.  I this case, Gary Busey plays an evil wacko named Mr. Joshua who has a disfunction in his nervous system as he can take pain with no reaction and still keep fighting back until he is taken down.  Busey is as good as Gibson and this might be one of the movie's flaws, Busey's lack of screen-time.  The script could have been somewhat stronger but you can't have everything now can you.  Overall, it is a very cool action movie and is definitely worth a watch.

Joe Pesci), this Lethal derives its humour from the situations these two cops keep getting stuck in. For instance, Riggs as the suicidal cop (resulting from the recent death of his wife) has no fear and just walks head first into dangerous situations. It's a real laugh to see him doing his job because you just don't know what he's going to do next. The drug deal at the start where he plays three-stooges with the dealers and gives them 100 bucks for their stash is a fine example and is bound to raise more than a few smiles. Later he teams up with good cop Murtaugh and more mayhem ensues as these two adjust to each other's methods of policing. But in the spirit of all these types of movies, they end up being the best of pals and team up to really make the villains pay.The villains here are the best out of all the Lethal Weapons, with the exception of Jet Li in no. 4. Gary Busey gives one of his best performances as ex-mercenary Mr Joshua who now finds drug dealing a profitable pastime. The final fight between Joshua and Riggs is a highlight and apparently took 4 days to shoot. However, there are many other adrenalin-charged sequences between cops and scumbags including an explosive bus crash and a chase down Hollywood boulevard with the bare chested, machine gun packing Riggs going all-out to do his job.In summary, this is a great combination of action and comedy which is not seen in the more politically-correct action films of the 90's. Clearly the pick of the Lethal Weapon series and one of the best cop films of the 80's!8.5 - 9 / 10 "}{"Title":"(Spoiler Alert) Great film","Date":"6 December 1999","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":"  While it is not the best installment of the series it is action packed.

Glover is the loving family guy, and there's a delicious moment on his 50th birthday when his wife and three kids burst into the bathroom and give him hugs and kisses. Before leaving, his beautiful teen age daughter chides him because his beard is turning gray. Lots of well wishes and kisses and when they're gone, Glover turns his head slowly and gazes ruefully at his beard in the mirror. Fifty is the age at which the years go by so quickly that if they zipped along any faster they'd reach the speed of light and acquire infinite mass.We are introduced to Gibson waking up naked in his trailer on the beach, the TV still going from the night before. He slouches to the reefer, a butt hanging from his mouth, and gurgles down a bottle of beer. His wife was killed in an auto accident and he might just be psychotic. Later, he puts his pistol and his mouth and the musical score warns us that this is a serious moment but we don't believe it because we know damned well that Mel Gibson is not going to blow his inion off less than half-way through the movie.Anyway, his self-destructive tendencies only provide the excuse for his outrageous behavior. He and Glover, naturally, don't get along. Gibson shoots first, while Glover doesn't want to make waves. Glover is also black, while Gibson is Gibson. But -- not to worry. At the end, their arms around each other, they enjoy the warmth of Glover's hearth during Christmas dinner.The film gives the viewer the impression that the primary job of Los Angeles police detectives is to shoot guns. They shoot all the time, all kinds of guns. Gibson is a crack shot, having been a member of one of those special ops organizations in Vietnam. His gun looms large in his legend.I think the story and dialog would be pruned today. This was released in 1987 and we've been possessed by the dybbuk of political correctness in a major way since then. I don't think Gibson would be allowed to smoke once in a while. Streng verboten. And when Glover is rolling all over Gibson, trying to extinguish his burning jacket, I doubt that Gibson would be allowed to crack, What are you, a fag? I don't know about the intimated attraction between Glover's pretty young daughter, Darlene Love, and Gibson. Love is an attractive and sexy girl and the producers and director know it, otherwise they wouldn't have her running around in a tiny slip or tied up and threatened with rape by the bad guys. Lethal Weapon 2 might have been an interesting sequel had Gibson courted and married Love after she graduated from high school. I don't know how well that would have sat with some of the pertinent demographics.It's an exciting and diverting movie but it's really dumb too. The arrest of the evil Gary Busey is postponed while -- surrounded by cops and blazing lights on the front lawn -- Busey is loosed from his bonds to have a talent contest with Gibson to see who is the better martial arts expert. Gibson wins of course, partly by bumping his forehead hard against Busey's Here is Newton's third law of motion The mutual forces of action and reaction between two bodies are equal, opposite and collinear. That means that if you jar the other guy's brain with your head, your brain is just as jarred. Anyway, this martial arts jamboree resembles in no way what we were taught in boot camp. The fight would have been over in ten seconds, the instant one guy gouged his opponent's eyeball out.As the sensible cop, Glover is pretty good. He has considerable range as an actor. Catch him as the laid-back serial murderer in Switchback. Gibson, I always have trouble with because his delivery of lines, especially wisecracks, seems so suggestive of acting. There's no real point in going on about the plot, which has to do with some heroin importing business left over from Vietnam. It's no more than a peg to hang the action on.

Possibly, Mr. Gibson is mooning over the death of his wife, some years earlier. Both Gibson and new crime-fighting partner Danny Glover (as Roger Murtaugh) served time in Vietnam. Gibson brings a Vietnam War-like style of fighting to the streets of Los Angeles, but Mr. Glover is a little more laid-back. Glover has a sweet wife (singer Darlene Love) and family, including nubile daughter Traci Wolfe (as Rianne Murtaugh). Old-timer Glover is fretting about turning fifty. And, it's Christmastime.At first, Gibson and Glover don't get along as partners. Because Gibson's reputation is to shoot first and ask questions later, Glover tells him, I suppose we have to register you as a lethal weapon. Gibson tells Glover the police department thinks he's either suicidal or trying for a psycho pension. Although different, the cops bond. The script is careful to note there are no fag feelings between them, though. Our heroes fight a great duo of villains, stoic heroin dealer Mitchell Ryan (as Peter McAllister) and bruising henchman Gary Busey (as Mr. Joshua). They, and director Richard Donner's action sequences, keep the ordinary from being too dull.With over seven minutes of previously unavailable scenes, this Director's Cut is the version you should include yourself in, according to the DVD description, Riggs' solitary homelife and the tragic loss spurring him in a reckless disregard for his own safety now come into greater focus. We see that recklessness is new scenes underlining the differences between the two cops. Murtaugh, just 50, needs reassurance about his skills at a firing range. Riggs, not caring if he sees another birthday, coolly walks into a schoolyard sniper's field of fire. All the humor and adrenaline that made this original an entertainment milestone are here, too. ****** Lethal Weapon (3/6/87) Richard Donner ~ Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Gary Busey, Mitchell Ryan "},{"Title":"Good cop, bad cop.","Date":"22 May 2008","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" My Take While somewhat dated in spots, this is an enjoyable caper comedy with some thrilling action and well-developed characters. LETHAL WEAPON still remains one of the classic 80's action pictures. But it ain't a classic for non-stop action ala DIE HARD and RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK. The film is memorable heavily for the partnership between the two leads, Mel Gibson as Martin Riggs and Danny Glover as Roger Murtaugh. Gibson is the suicidal type, Glover is the nice family guy type. For just the bond between and the sparing of these two characters, LETHAL WEAPON had me and never lost me.The main plot concerns the odd couple cop partners battle against drug lords. But the real plot mainly concerns how these two characters go together. The action scenes, including two car chase with one against a helicopter, come later during the film. But director Richard Donner doesn't keep us waiting. He makes his actors fun to watch to make sure the audiences stuck to them till the end. The trick works, and these two leads are very fun to watch.Gibson is very lively as Riggs, a crazy guy ready to explode. He's wacky and witty, yet darn serious and just plain nuts at the same time. Glover is his counterpart, and he's just as good to watch. It's nice to see a cop movie where the cop's family plays some essence in the story. What Glover's character cares about (his family), we care about. Then there are the bad guys, which like all great villains are real meanies. The villain played by Gary Busey (the nearly unstoppable Mr. Joshua) is probably the best of the other villains in the film played by Mitch Ryan and others.Overall, it's not as relentlessly busy as DIE HARD or the INDIANA JONES movies. But it's the closest one where we'll get to an action movie with well-developed characters.Rating **** out of 5. "},{"Title":"A perfect blend of humor and action. Strongly recommended.(Spoilers)","Date":"2 May 2008","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" I watched Lethal Weapon in the theater when it first came out in 1987, it blew me away. I've never seen such a movie like that before, it had been copied for numerous times so it wouldn't be so appealing nowadays. I bought DVDs of the Lethal Weapon series. To me, this one still stands out as the best of the four. Its brilliance and luster retains even though I watch it in 2008. It certainly deserves to get at least one Oscar for the performance and some special effects but it was overlooked. One of the most eloquent evidence that proves the Academy Award is a joke.First, this movie starts with a aerial view of the city of Los Angeles. As the title Lethal Weapon appears, you get a feeling this is not only a cop movie but also an ultimate blockbuster. Later, the camera stops in the balcony. We see a half-naked woman lying on the bed, as if she is drowned or her high is coming up. However, she somehow climbs onto the balcony and takes a dive out of the building. Her death leads to an introduction of an middle-aged cop who is celebrating his birthday. His name is Murtaugh(played by Danny Glover), he is fifty years old when he takes this case. Later, he is informed he will be partnered with a cop named Riggs(played by Mel Gibson), only to find out the cop is suicidal because his wife was killed in a car accident a few years ago. First, the two cops detest each other very much. As time goes on, they become accustomed to each other and they stand together to fight against the bad guys of the movie. The bad guys are a bunch of veterans who become drug dealers by smuggling the heroin from Vietnam. Their leader is stern general and a macho guy named Joshua(played by Gary Busey), who is the top guy in the unit. All the actors were doing a great job and delivered believable, flesh-and-blood, and comical characters. Mel Gibson gave an outstanding performance as Riggs. His hardened exterior could not cover up the fragile interior of his. He was in a dilemma whether to kill himself or go on living. Danny Glover was also remarkable, he did everything by the book, who could ever forget his characteristics Shooting criminals in the leg and shooting people directly in the head. Gary Busey gave his best performance to date. This is one movie he ever immersed into his character. The action scenes were perfectly done. Almost two hours of non-stop action can satisfy action fans. Also, it can be considered a comedy to watch when you want to get rid of your burden. Also, some people have the tradition to watch it on Christmas. It can have different significance and interpretation reviewed by different people. Good story, good actors, crazy action, comical scenes, and significant masterpiece. This movie is a landmark of cop movies. 20 years and it still retains all these good elements. Strongly recommended for you to watch it.

Especially when Murtaugh says to him that Riggs came from the special forces in the war in Vietnam. The reason for the craziness is clear--the Vietnam War caused the whole United States to protest Americans who fought in it. And especially when he faces off with something ripped-out of the headlines from the Columbine high school shooting in the director's cut version....a crazed man at a school firing randomly with an automatic weapon, and Riggs, in a very high-risk move, moves towards the line of fire at the shooter, plays a game of you missed the target to confuse the shooter, and finally knocks him dead with his 9mm at close range. Or even more, when Riggs hammers his head himself with his fists--as if his head was some type of drum------in front of his first perpetrator and then without warning points his 9mm at him--and surprise is Riggs' way of arresting perpetrators (because he uses unusual diversions).The scene involving Riggs and a suicidal man on a roof who wants to jump to their death tells more about Riggs' character....Riggs loves to talk fast, and, as mentioned before, he loves surprises, especially when he handcuffs the suicidal man without even telling him......and their famous jump off the roof into an awaiting safety mat is almost like the movie Hooper, which gives you a gist of how a Hollywood stunt person lives with one's work.During the torture scene, where Endo shocks Riggs with about 600 volts of electricity over a shower raining on Riggs, I had seen why there was water. They say water and electricity don't mix. Doubly exciting was the part where Joshua tortures Murtaugh by attempting to break his left arm....and the intercutting camera work on both of the tortured characters.The final climax shows why police officers use handcuffs on their arrestees...here, you think Joshua is down for the count after the final fight with Riggs as he is dragged side-by-side by police officers without handcuffs. There was very good editing work on Joshua's sudden act of wrestling away one of the officer's guns and Riggs's 9mm and Murtaugh's .38 finally finishing him off...probably the only time in all four of the Lethal Weapon movies where the two main characters shoot their guns at the same time. The film speed at that point was about 1/4 speed as if you are fast-forwarding on 1/4 speed on your DVD remote.

The other is a family man who just turned 50; his name is Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover). They don't like each other and that's made clear since Murtaugh knows being partnered with a psycho cop is likely to get him killed.

The dead woman happens to be the daughter of an old friend of Murtaugh's (Tom Atkins), who was himself involved with mercenaries from the Vietnam War that specialized in heroin smuggling.

Their investigation eventually leads back to these mercenaries and their shadowy leader General McAllister (Mitch Ryan) and his peroxide-blonde chief henchman Mr. Joshua (Gary Busey).

The black cop is personally involved in the case they handle, the white cop is a little suicidal.Where most movies like this work to hard on the relationship between the two and therefore force most of the jokes, 'Lethal Weapon' starts by being a good action movie and from there it thinks further. The movie is funny because the characters simply do what you would expect them to do and because personalities collide it gets funny. Not that it is very different in other movies like this, but in those movies the characters have some strange habits to make it funny. Here the characters feel more real.The black cop is Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover), the white cop Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson). Together they have to solve a case that involves drugs, an old Vietnam friend of Murtaugh and a villain played by Gary Busey. The screenplay is not very complicated, more like a simple police story, but it has some nice touches. We know Gibson can not die in the first couple of minutes of the movie, but when he holds that gun to his own head we really feel the fear he must have. This movie is one of the reasons he is the star he is today, and you understand why.

One of the greatest films of all time.","Date":"20 September 2003","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":"  Some Spoiler Herein.I guess we're gonna have to register you as a lethal weapon. - Danny Glover, Lethal Weapon.There's such a flow and deep character progression that helps make Lethal Weapon what it is today -- a funny, action-packed, and yet also quite intelligent cop-buddy film that owes its success in part to the smartness of its script, the solid direction by Richard Donner, and the interaction of its two lead stars, Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, who bounce jokes and one-liners off each other with such comic timing and gruffness it makes one wonder why the strict comedies released nowadays can't be half as funny as this mixed-genre buddy film.Lethal Weapon is a very tough film, brutal and vicious. Roger Ebert described it perfectly when he said, A movie where you and your date grab each other's arm every four minutes and you walk out black and blue and grinning from ear to ear. That's exactly how I feel when I'm done watching it. The later sequels were extremely good given that the formula of these type of films usually get old very quick - in fact, as sequels go they surprisingly never really grew old in formula at all. But they did seem to gradually lose the toughness and brutality of the first film, at least after the second, something that helps elevate it to a type of hard action movie status. Those looking for a soft buddy comedy have rented the wrong movie.The strength of the film lies within the hands of its two lead stars; it is firmly rooted and all else flows with ease and an almost simple splendor. Mel Gibson plays a Mad Max gone homicidal. Danny Glover plays a retiring cop stuck with a lethal weapon of a partner for his last few days as an officer of the law. They'll be lucky to make it through the next week without killing each other first.It opens high up in the night sky to the song Jingle Bell Rock and comes to focus in a naked woman's apartment. She's drugged up and walks to an open ledge overlooking the landscape above and below. She jumps.The next day. Sgt. Roger Murtaugh (Glover) is having his fiftieth birthday. He's retiring from the police force. As he so aptly puts it, I'm too old for this feces.Murtagh's bad day gets even worse when he's assigned a new partner named Martin Riggs (Gibson). Riggs is suicidal, the police force has their suspicions of this, and so they team him up with Murtaugh as a way of (a) seeing if he's just playing crazy to get a pension and (b) to get him out of their way. Murtaugh thinks he's playing crazy to make some extra cash - until he watches Riggs put a gun in his mouth and almost pull the trigger. You really are crazy.Then the two men stumble upon a drug smuggling operation that goes back to the days of the Vietnam War. Things get personal when Murtaugh's family is in danger. Murtaugh's daughter is kidnapped and the two men have to find a way to get her back alive.Most films like these are just shouting matches between the two cops. They typically have a paper-thin plot with lots of shoot-'em-up action. Lethal Weapon is smarter than this -- it has shouting, it has plenty of shoot-'em-ups, but it also has a good plot -- enough plot for at least ten of these buddy films,The actors are terrific in their roles. Danny Glover's family man is absolutely convincing. I especially like throughout the four films when someone will make a remark about how old he is -- like his daughter mentioning his beard making him look older in the first film -- and he just stares in a mirror and looks at himself with that, I'm getting older. I can't believe it look.Mel Gibson is perfect as Riggs, a suicidal maniac who doesn't care if he goes down until he finds something to live for. The audience finds out early on that his wife has been killed, and her death has pushed him over the edge to the point where he has to think of a good reason not to blow his head off each day.

It was incredible. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are a perfect team in this movie. A young man who wants to commit suicide because his wife dies and a older man who has a family for a long time is not a good mix. Put these two together and destruction is bound to happen. My favorite scene in this movie is when Mel Gibson was on top of the building with a guy who is about to jump off and Mel Gibson handcuffs himself to the other man and jumps off together. He thought it was fun but the other guy was going insane. I think that particular scene shows how crazy and determined the character Martin Riggs really is. The non-stop action was incredible. The ending was full of high quality action that will keep you at the edge of your seat the whole time. Mel Gibson was incredible at the ending. Danny Glover was also full of surprises as well. I give Lethal Weapon **** out of ****. It was a classic movie and I recommend this movie to all viewers who like non-stop action and comedy and are Mel Gibson fans because this was by far Mel Gibson's most classical movie he made besides the movie Braveheart which he won an oscar for Best Director.

The film takes a while to establish itself, and is slightly tedious during the first half hour or hour, but much of it is well done and quite entertaining. Richard Donner's direction is fast paced and helps the film move through the slower parts almost effortlessly.	The acting is absolutely first rate. Glover is excellent in the lead, and Gibson is good, but many of the scenes belong to villain Gary Busey, appearing in one of his (very) few 'real' roles, those being ones not of the B variety. He's a good actor who can't seem to choose roles well. Gibson is the lesser of the two leads, but still better than many other actors could do. He starts to fit in more with his character in the next three films, but is still more than respectable. 	If you are a fan of any of the three stars, or of director Donner, I recommend seeing it, or else you may be disappointed.

After awhile, they found out this girl was drugged up, later, they find out she was poisoned by the drugs, and even later, they found a tape of her in the shower!!!!

One is a 50 year old (Glover) and one is a crazy guy who is on the verge of killing himself (Mel Gibson, just back from those Mad Max films, and he is a little mad in this movie)  So the two of them are trying to find the drug dealers, led by some fruitcake and is loyal assistant only known as Mr. Joshua (Gary Busey), nice name.  This movie is pretty good, and features an awesome fight in the end between Mel and Busey.  This great action movie gets a 7/10, it has your action, suspense, and even a hint of comedy, but more comes in the sequels. Rated R for nudity, violence, and language.

Yes, there were several before (and many since!), but this one feels like the peak of the genre, and it's mainly due to the tremendous acting displayed by it's stars Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, but ESPECIALLY Gibson! I honestly believe that Gibson was robbed of a Best Actor nomination for his intense, deeply involving performance of L.A. Police Sergeant Martin Riggs, a suicidal 11-year police vet who mourns the loss of his wife in a tragic car accident every single day of his life. Riggs lives life on the edge. He can't keep a partner due to his affinity for danger. In comes Sergeant Roger Murtaugh (excellently played by Danny Glover), a family man who just turned 50 and is ready for early retirement, because, you know, he's too old for this sh*t! LOL.Riggs is paired with Murtaugh to investigate an apparent suicide of a coked-out 18-year old Amanda Hunsaker (played by Jackie Swanson of Cheers fame in the scene that opened the film) and things get interesting fast as the suicide leads the cops to a web of intrigue. The girl's father, a prominent banker Michael Hunsaker is a former Army buddy of Murtaugh who saved his life in Vietnam. The banker is played by Tom Atkins (a stalwart of John Carpenter 70s-80s flicks) and Atkins is very persuasive as a man in over his head. Turns out that Hunsaker is involved in money laundering, using his bank as a front for a local drug ring comprised of former military specialists. The head of the ring is General McAllister (played with cold detachment by Mitchell Ryan) and his right hand is Mr. Joshua (played with scary, scene-stealing brilliance by Gary Busey). There seemed to be a trend around this time of having high class villains in action movies, with McAllister and Joshua actually preceding the Die Hard villains Hans and Karl by about a year and a half (Lethal Weapon technically premiered on Christmas Day '86 while Die Hard came out the summer of '88). But the Lethal Weapon villains are just as scary and intense (if not more so) than the Die Hard ones. The real pull of Lethal Weapon to me is the authentic chemistry and budding relationship between Riggs and Murtaugh and their snappy banter throughout. There have been buddy movies ad nauseum over the years, but this one feels like the best due to the believable progression of the Riggs-Murtaugh relationship. Of course, this being the first film of the eventual series (there were 4 total), this is the only one where Riggs and Murtaugh actually disliked each other for most of the film, but by the end they were best buddies, which carried over to all the sequels. Anyone who watched any of the (inferior) sequels first will find it hard to imagine that these 2 cops actually had an active dislike for each other at one point, but you have to start somewhere!Notable performances are also delivered by Darlene Love (as Murtaugh's wife Trish) and Traci Wolfe (as Murtaugh's eldest daughter Rianne, who has a crush on Riggs). The film was directed with energy, style, and flair by Richard Donner, who notedly directed the first Superman film from 1978 (interesting dichotomy) and would go onto direct all 3 Lethal Weapon sequels. But this is the one that got it right...it's the original...usually that's the keeper!

Two lunatic cops are paired together. One, Glover, who appears sane ( but loses it frequently) has a house, kids, and a wife who needs to meet Betty Crocker or Chef Boy-Yar-Dee. The other makes no pretense at sanity (Gibson)...declared dangerous by a department shrink...other cops refuse to work with him out of fear. Sounds like a typical strike force cop if you grew up in the ghetto. Not exactly a match made in heaven, and not quite as satisfying as Laurel and Hardy, they bumble their way through a series of events where there is a lot of action, a lot of gunfire, and a lot of blood. But when the daughter of an old friend of Glover's winds up dead and the death is ruled as a homicide instead of a suicide, the two bumblers find themselves on the trail of a vicious drug and crime ring. For those who thrive on action in films and violence, this one is right up your alley. But it is not without its flaws. There is one scene where a man is threatening suicide by jumping from a tall building. Gibson apprehends him and they both jump into free-fall...but what the director holds out on is...they jump into an air-bag cushion that is already in place, not mentioned, and not visible to viewers until they fall into it. A 'cheap shot' scene like this one took away any credibility this film might have had for me...and holding out on that was an insult to the intelligence of the viewer. I grudgingly watched the rest after that, but that made me lose respect for the integrity of the film...or the lack of it. Watch it if you want, but be prepared for the ridiculous. "},{"Title":"Remember when action films had action in them?","Date":"1 May 2005","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" If you do, then viewing Lethal Weapon once more on DVD-Video will be like returning to an old friend after an absence of several decades. The concept of the buddy cop routine was old and tired, even in the late 1980s, but stellar performances from Danny Glover and a very fresh-faced Mel Gibson made Lethal Weapon one to truly stand out from the pack. It also managed to impress upon viewers like myself that sometimes, you cannot keep the evil lurking out there away from your family. Whether this is a subtle comment on the blindness of attempts by action films to be family-friendly, as they call it, or just an amusing side effect, is best left to the individual viewer.The story begins with a typical day in the life of an aging detective by the name of Roger Murtaugh. If this man embodied the family-man spirit any more, he would have to be stuffed and mounted on a wall. But after kissing the wife and children goodbye before reporting for another day at work, one of his worst nightmares comes true. His new partner is a rather strange-looking character by the name of Martin Riggs. In the course of just one day, Riggs manages to risk his life, and that of his new partner, in so many memorable ways that the film is now entrenched as an example of the buddy cop film not only being done right, but being done brilliantly. Part of this lies in the fact that rather that resorting to cultural stereotyping to make the bond work, Lethal Weapon focuses more on what makes this admittedly mismatched pair similar.The main plot focuses on investigating the suicide of a young woman who happens to be the daughter of an old war buddy of Murtaugh's. As the two detectives begin asking questions, a string of extremely memorable attempts on their lives begins. They say that an action hero is only as strong as his antagonist, and Gary Busey gives Mel Gibson a lot to work with here. Gibson, fresh off the rather tepid third installment in the Mad Max franchise, obviously knew this was his shot at the big time, and he rides it for everything that it is worth. What is interesting to note is that Danny Glover, although treated as the elder statesman of this duo, had about the same number of films under his belt at the time. It is sadly ironic that this, rather than a role in a great historical drama like The Colour Purple, Glover is hardly remembered outside of this admittedly impressive cavalcade of stunts.I have been reading articles recently that state, among other things, that the real reason films have been getting more expensive and less profitable is not so much production costs, but because of a massive explosion in salaries. Lethal Weapon, estimated to have cost fifteen million to make, took in more than four times that sum at the box office. That's to say nothing of all the rentals and video sales that this, regarded by some as the best action/buddy film, has generated. It reminds me of a satirical graphic developed by one pack of jokers that states the fact that film executives once paid Keanu Reeves thirty million dollars, but piracy is making them bankrupt. Although I disagree with the idea that the best films were made in the so-called Golden Era, when studios reigned over cast and crew like the monarchs of old, I do agree with the notion that film does not function well at all when commerce is the driving factor. It has become better to lose money spending a hundred million rather than ten million, and the art suffers badly for it.Lethal Weapon is also (almost) the last film on the resumé of stuntman Dar Robinson, whose resume also includes the first two Police Academy films, along with other surprising classics like Rollerball. As Lethal Weapon was in post-production, Robinson was tragically killed in a motorbike accident. A brief dedication at the end of the film lets viewers in on the fact that behind all those men who dive off buildings or get blown up for their entertainment, there are names and faces. It is a quiet dedication that most never bother to watch, but it reminds that stuntmen are truly the unsung heroes of the action film industry.I gave Lethal Weapon a ten out of ten. It shows in no uncertain terms that action films work better when the director is allowed to focus on that little element called action. Not just the kind of action where some idiot shoots another with a cap gun, and you see some terrible playacting, but the kind of action where men are trapped in cars that, seconds later, explode with a mighty thud. They don't make them much better than this.

Gibson, as Riggs, gives one of his best acting performances ever. He's everything the part calls for. He's a border line psycho cop/ex Vietnam vet, who needs a stable cop, like Murtaugh (Danny Glover) to take him under his wing. Riggs is a very lonely guy, who just can't get over his wife's (Victoria Lynn) death, so basically he hates the world. This latest case which becomes personal for both cops, sees a young girl suiciding by free falling several stories, plummeting to her death, where later, it's discovered she was murdered, due to cooking up, where this pretty lass, was also used in pornographic films. But there's much more to this exciting story, where the bad guys are bad, and beautifully played by two heavyweights, but I won't disclose names. Action comes thick and fast in this, with no time to really stop. What makes Lethal Weapon, better than many of it's competitor action films, is beside the explosive action, is the family angle, where in between fighting baddies, Riggs and Murtaugh, spend some time out scenes like at Murtaugh's house, when he's invited for dinner. This is a great scene, and after on Murtaughs boat, where the last scene when all the dust has settled, just upon Christmas, and Murtaughs invites Riggs in, it couldn't be penned more better. This I will say, now, is the best buddy cop partnership in history, where we are thankful for the three sequels that followed. Lethal Weapon has a great young breakthrough writer as in Shane Black who was only 23 when he wrote this. The opening of the Jingle Bell Rock song, is unexpected, and too the title song is explosive. It's so much fun here, watching mad Mel, displaying so many emotions, some moments, really scaring us, as this is one unstable dude. The woman psychiatrist, played by a late actress, is really taking the p..s out of psychiatrists generally, by her un layman terms of evaluation.

Take two mismatched cops and make them reluctant partners, and as their relationship forms they go up against the bad guys and take them down. It's an 80's movie through and through, but it's still an enjoyable movie today. The best thing about Lethal Weapon is that it's not a leave your brain at the door action movie with gunplay, fights and explosions that ignores the story. It's not a movie with action for the sake of action, and it certainly not a movie that relies on an endless body count. The action and violence fits in perfectly with the story to make it believable as the movie flows very smoothly. Lethal Weapon makes its name as a great action movie that never stops, interesting well rounded characters, crackling and witty dialogue with occasional moments of humour, excellent cinematography, and a fully fleshed out story with excellent attention to detail.The movie starts with Jingle Bell Rock playing over the opening credits as the camera pans over the blue tinted Los Angeles skyline at night. The mood quickly changes when Amanda Hunsaker (Jackie Swanson) leaps to her death from her apartment balcony which forms the basis of the story. Sergeant Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) investigates the apparent suicide and he later finds out that Amanda Hunsaker is the daughter of Michael Hunsaker (Tom Atkins), a former Vietnam Veteran that Roger served with during the war. At the same time, we are introduced to Sergeant Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson), a crazy, wild eyed rebel with a death wish following the death of his wife in a car accident in 1984. Martin Riggs has lost the will to live and often takes wild risks, hoping he will die in the line of duty. Riggs and Murtaugh are polar opposites. Roger Murtaugh has just celebrated his 50th birthday and he is a proud family man at heart. He is also a conservative by-the-book police detective who is also considering retirement after 20 years with the Los Angeles Police Department. Martin Riggs is a police detective with a wild suicidal streak who is not afraid to put himself in harms way. He has attempted suicide but decides against it as he hopes to end his misery in the line of duty. Riggs has also served in the Vietnam War and was a former US Army Special Forces soldier specialising as a trained killer. These skills have served him well as well as his psychotic behaviour which gives him a dangerous edge against his enemies. Following serious concerns about Riggs' wild behaviour, he is transferred from Narcotics to Homicide and partnered with Murtaugh. Though they resent each other at first, their partnership grows solid throughout the movie, and also giving Martin Riggs a new lease on life. Amanda Hunsaker's suicide turns out not to be the case as the trail leads Riggs and Murtaugh to a heroin smuggling syndicate operated by a former Special Forces group named Shadow Company which operated during the Viwtman War. Shadow Company is made up of a gang of mercenaries led by ex-military General Peter McAllister (Mitchell Ryan) and his chief enforcer and right hand man Mr Joshua (Gary Busey). Riggs and Murtaugh take on McAllister and Mr Joshua when they declare war through the streets of Los Angeles.Besides Braveheart and Mad Max, Lethal Weapon is one of Mel Gibson's best movies. Mel Gibson's role as Martin Riggs is certainly one to remember. His character is psychotic and unstable like a powder keg waiting to explode, but he also brings a comedic side to Riggs with a love of The Three Stooges. Danny Glover is tailor made to the role of Roger Murtaugh, a sensible police detective and a proud family man at heart. Gary Busey's role as the intimidating enforcer Mr Joshua made him a great villain. Believe it or not, this was Gary Busey's first role as a villain which has seen him cast as the villain such as Under Siege (1992) and Drop Zone (1994) or a crazed character such as Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998), and also lends his voice in Grand Theft Auto Vice City (2002).Richard Donner previously directed The Omen (1976) and Superman (1978) and had cemented his reputation as a reliable director. Richard Donner created an unbeatable chemistry with Lethal Weapon and there has not been a movie that has been able to beat it. He has also since carried on with the chemistry with a further three sequels. Writer Shane Black found himself in high demand for action movies following the success of Lethal Weapon and since then, he has written The Last Boy Scout (1991) and The Long Kiss Goodnight (1996) and received a record setting sum of money for his work. He has proved he is not just a pretty face as an actor appearing as Hawkins in Predator (1987) and small roles here and there, as well as striking success as a director with Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005) and Iron Man 3 (2013). Producer Joel Silver also can add Lethal Weapon to his long list of box office blockbusters along with 48 Hrs (1982), Predator (1987), Die Hard (1988), The Matrix (1999), and Sherlock Holmes (2009).There have been numerous buddy cop movies that have been released since Lethal Weapon, and numerous movies such as but not limited to Tango & Cash (1989), The Rookie (1990), Bad Boys (1995) and its sequel Bad Boys II (2003), The Glimmer Man (1996), The Other Guys (2010), and The Heat (2013) do not hold a candle to Lethal Weapon or any of its sequels.Lethal Weapon is still an enjoyable action movie years later, and the magic continues with Riggs and Murtaugh returning in Lethal Weapon 2 (1989), Lethal Weapon 3 (1992), and Lethal Weapon 4 (1998).

It is discovered that her drugs were laced with poison and if she didn't jump from the building she would have died very soon in any case.Roger relays this new information to the father, who makes it very clear that regardless of Roger's badge and job description he wants the people responsible D.E.D.D.Pausing only to jump a jumper and to ponder the worth of his life, Riggs and Murtaugh are on the case...Being an 80s movie the plot is complex but not unnecessarily convoluted, the duo rapidly learn that they are up against a team of extremely dangerous mercenaries who intend to make a large shipment of heroin in only a few days, the team are led by the General and his loyal 2IC Mr Joshua (Gary Busey), who as well as being a crack soldier is perhaps the equal of Riggs in the insanity stakes.The mercenaries are vicious and brutal, and they target anyone in their way or anyone who might pose a threat, they quickly decide that Riggs and Murtaugh are both. Thankfully Riggs and Murtaugh are equally determined to deal with them and have no intention of running away. Each of them even get their own personal nemesis to off in the finale.After the initial wariness and friction Riggs and Murtaugh gradually develop a bond, which by the end of the film is already an easy chemistry. There are many setpieces that are extremely effective and some cool 80s stuntwork and driving sequences.This film wasn't as worried about the comedy elements as the sequels so it doesn't try so hard, but as a result the jokes work a little better, and of course they are often thrown around in the middle of crisis situations.Lethal Weapon is one of the better preserved classics of the 80s, it has aged very well and aside from being a little slow at times in comparison to today's action flicks it stands up against any film of the last decade and features a cast full of bit actors from half of the films made in the decade. The reasonably straightforward plot is a plus - the good guys are good and the bad guys need plugging full of holes - and the action to comedy ratio is just in favour of the action.As it should be.I said to my wife that Riggs is Gibson's Rambo or Rocky, and if you think he hasn't strongly considered dragging him out of retirement to attempt to rebuild his image you're nuts. I then joked (repeat JOKED) that given his tirades in the last few years Riggs would take on a group of Jewish criminals... then turn the gun on Roger.If that sounds off-colour it is more a reflection of Gibson than anything else.I wouldn't watch Lethal Weapon 5; but I must (begrudgingly) admit that the original Lethal Weapon is a great flick.Final Rating - 8.5 / 10. One of the best buddy cop action flicks. Well paced with big explosions, car chases, snappy quips and a high body count. Immensely entertaining.

He is a cop without any equal and pairs with another cop who is only second but learns fast. The action is highly packed and intense and that is exactly what we want, what we like. But is action enough to make a good film? Of course not. The film is good first of all because of the small touches of humanity that are scattered all around, a dog as a best friend, a cat as a best buddy, and you can imagine the meeting of the two on Christmas day. A boat that has a front and a back and no water all around. Several kids who are as nice as kids know how to be when they are in a good mood, and we are surprised by the high level of resistance and resilience they demonstrate in the midst of that frantic action. A few black street boys who are deliciously anti-cop and just like ice cream so much that they start forgetting they are not supposed to speak to cops. A grenade that is a smoke bomb. A birthday that turns hectic with too many candles, definitely too many, on the cake. A shooting gallery that turns funny with bullets carving nice smiles into the faces of all the culprits in the world. And that and many more details make that film a real pleasure, nearly emotional. But the film is a lot better than that. When a country starts something dirty in the world against another country or another people, sooner or later the criminals that country has trained to do the bad job will come back to haunt everyone in their tombs or a little before they put them in their tombs. Killing machines are killing machines and you cannot stop them because you decide the war is over. That's why you should never start a war anywhere in the world, and those professional trained criminals can only be put to death because they will never accept any other trial or judgment, nor any period of peace and quiet at the bottom of a jail seen as an aquarium for gold fishes. They can only end fighting with real weapons and killed by real bullets, two rather than one, from two different guns rather than only one. That's what makes this film a lasting pleasure because in the world there is always the temptation to start a new war, and after starting a first one you cannot resist starting a second to spread the feast and the fun and make hundreds of thousands of people, in uniform or not, take part in the danse macabre that leads right to the cemetery, what's more an anonymous tomb of course, or just a collective grave, a big hole with some lye on top of the dismembered bodies. But we can end with the beginning then and imagine what the best friend dog and the best buddy cat do together when they meet. They do what human beings always do when they meet they fight over their differences.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID "},{"Title":"Best action movie ever","Date":"25 March 2010","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" This movie the first time I watched it had me falling off the couch laughing.

Slyvester Stallone went from Rocky, to jumping on the action Bandwagon with the Rambo series. Even Arnold had established himself just fine in both the sci-fi and action worlds.Then everything changed. With a stellar cast and truly great director at the helm, Out comes Lethal Weapon.Suddenly, the body count became secondary to the plot, and not the other way around. The old Who dunit and the supercharged action film got merged together. Suddenly, Hollywood found a new way to make action films.The story is simple. When the daughter of an old Army buddy dies, Roger Murtuagh, nearing the end of his police career, is assigned to the case. The catch is he has to take a partner. MArtin Riggs, whom Murtaugh mistakes as a crazed gunman looking to take the police station hostage. That in my opinion sets up one of the best and most introductions of two characters ever filmed.Murtaugh see's Riggs Loose Cannon tactics, and including the well intended, but only adding to the troubles, advice from the police department's psychologist, Murtaugh thinks that his new partner may just be the end of him.However, the film steers from being overly dramatic min this aspect to allow for a little humor. Humor until now had been something that action films had been nearly devoid of. After an exchangement of war stories, soon the mis matched pair begin to have a trust in each other.Soon they are on the trail of drug runners, ironically funded by Roger's ex army buddy, who it turns out, who's daughter was murdered to keep him silent.However, he himself becomes expendable when the drug runners think he's going to spill his guts to his former army buddy, and quickly dispatch of him while he attempts to tell his side to Murtaugh.Gary Busey is at his evil zenith as Mr. Joshua, a skilled killer with little regard for human life. After Murtaugh's daughter is kidnapped, he and Riggs go it alone to get her back. That sets up a battle which goes from the desert, to down town LA, and ends with a karate battle right on Murtuagh's own front yard.The fight between Riggs and Joshua is suspenseful, and excellently shot, with the rain fall adding great effect. And by the time the movie's over, Murtaugh and Riggs are now the closest of friends, over coming the troubled start.I really do think this one film changed the way that action films are shot. No longer is a high body count the most important part. Now story development is paid attention to. The Lethal Weapon series is perhaps the most groundbreaking on that point alone.

Murtaugh is an older family man who is just doing the job till his retirement.They get involved in the death of a prostitute, who turns out to be Murtaugh's old army buddy's daughter.What makes this movie different is many fold. Firstly there are a lot of sub plots and issues that tie into the overall story. Such as Riggs suicidal tendencies and his special forces military training. It is not just an ad-on, but forms part of a character arc for Riggs.There is also the police investigation. It is like real police work. Based on guess work, in exact, but no incredible plot twists. Most police work involves arresting the person standing over the dead body with a bloody knife shouting I did it. This story shows how police try and work through something tricky but solvable by simple good police work.Then there is the action. Other than Mel Gibson pretending he knows Jujitsu the action is both realistic and exciting (no situations where 2 people shoot at each other, only the good guy hits, rather it is about the strategy, the chase and so on).Finally there is the humour. Jokes are understated and perfect for Mel.Oh wait...girls, you get to see Mel's naked bottom.....when he was young and sexy.This movie works at so many different levels (from naked bottoms up to great character development) that it will be enjoyed by many people.

As Murtaugh reluctantly takes on the recently diagnosed psychotic Riggs, they start off Murtaugh's birthday by investigating the death of a prostitute, who just happens to be the daughter of a long lost Vietnam buddy Michael Hunsaker (Tom Atkins). The two mismatched police detectives discover that Hunsaker has been involved in a huge drug-smuggling operation run by former Vietnam mercenaries named Shadow Company, led by General Peter McAllister (Mitch Ryan) with the aid of Mr. Joshua (Gary Busey). Everyone (including Murtaugh's family) becomes involved in this dangerous game which ultimately becomes a battle of courage and skill to defeat the enemy before innocent lives are lost.Well there you go, I say buy the set, unless you hate action movies or something.

Gary Busey plays Mr. Joshua, a mean an arrogant man who fights Gibson and Glover till it comes down to them killing Busey. Gary Busey does a great job at being a bad guy(Almost like Kevin Costner in 3000 Miles To Graceland). Overall, this movie shows how it is to be a cop and fighting the bad guys.

The script from Shane Black set a big standard for Hollywood action movies. I guess Die Hard is more popular because of it's spectacular scenes, Lethal Weapon is more gritty; the opening scene shows a naked cokehead prostitute jumping off of a balcony on to a car roof, later Riggs' thinks about suicide, and there are notions of drugs and torture.

It had everything a good action movie needs to make it successful; excellent character development, imaginative direction, professional performances by the cast and crew, a clever and witty screenplay with intelligent dialog, and action...lots of good fast-paced, well-delivered action. It had a fresh comedic element without ever turning to camp or juvenile antics to solicit a chuckle from us. The comedy was educated, intelligent and expertly-delivered. The characters were lovable, and we got the feeling that we knew them, cared about them, wanted them to succeed. Riggs's character felt less like a character and more like a person, due to the high-level of development his character received. True, the gun handling left a lot to be desired, but the vast majority of audiences would not realize that you can not get 20 shots from a 16 shot clip. Nor would they realize that you can't just leave those empty clips on the ground; they cost MONEY and no CoP would do that because law enforcement officers are typically not highly paid. That aside, this was an excellent movie with wonderful entertainment value. One of the best of its kind.2 - gave us Joe Pesci's character, Leo Getz. Because of Getz, I honestly found this film to be rather endearing. Getz is one of the best characters to have been introduced to this series. Unfortunately, the edge and freshness is toned down way too much, and the action is really rather predictable. I thoroughly enjoyed bearing witness to the further development of the relationship between Riggs and Murtaugh, and was not in the least bored with that aspect. It is still a good movie, even though its edge is shelved for a more marketable product.3 - is just as good as 2. Riggs now has a new love interest and it seems as though all will be well and all manner of things will be well. It is still a few months away from the press release concerning the Glover/Gibson signing for 4 & 5, so it seems the series has wound down, rather than up. The action is still quality, though there are fewer and fewer unpredictable moments. The comedic aspect which was enlightened and intelligent is now a bit puerile and tired. And while the performances are still professional, it seems as though Riggs and Murtaugh both are well on their way out.4 - is the perfect ending to this series. Honestly. The characters have developed as far as I can bear to witness; Murtaugh misfires his gun in the locker room of the precinct, Riggs gets his butt kicked by a rookie cop in the boxing ring, and Riggs and Murtaugh are both just too old for this action thing anymore. (Gods help us with 60-something-year-old Harrison Ford in the upcoming Indiana Jones 4.) Their CHARACTERS speak constantly of being too old, and I'm not talking about Murtaugh's well used line, I'm getting too old for this sh*t. It is far beyond that. And now, with Riggs's marriage to Lorna, Murtaugh's daughter's marriage to Butters, the new babies and all the smarmy crap at the ending...enough is just enough.5 - should never happen. I don't think I can bear to see anymore smarm from these two. The characters we all loved are already gone. Like in Invasion of the Bodysnatchers, they've been stolen from us. The edge from Riggs's character is gone. He's a bit hapless now, and sad rather than the lunatic mayhem we want and NEED from his character.The only way to pull off a 5th installment would be to kill off Lorna's character, the baby AND Butters. Either put Riggs back where his character was in 1 & 2, or don't bring him out of the moth balls. PLEASE. I loved these movies, but for the love of Mike! NO MORE!If you liked any of these movies, I highly recommend Tango & Cash, an excellent, much-overlooked, highly under-rated Buddy-Cop movie.1. 9.2/102. 8.8/103. 7.6/104. 6.8/10 from...the Fiend .

At the same time the department has assigned Murtaugh with a new partner, Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) a man with a death wish who has been suffering with depression ever since his wife Victoria was killed in a car crash. Their investigations prove that Amanda Hunsaker was murdered and as they delve deeper they find themselves immersed in the world of organised drug trafficking and also find their original distrust and suspicion for each other grow into friendship.Perhaps not the greatest action movie ever, and in my opinion a little poorer than the first two sequels, &#145;Lethal Weapon' is an exceptional action/thriller and is definitely worth checking out. &#145;Lethal Weapon' is rather dark and gritty and deals with numerous interesting, and often emotional, scenes. Mel Gibson is great as the suicidal Martin Riggs and makes his character shine out in many scenes, including a school-yard sniper scene in the directors cut version. The audience can identify with Riggs and feel sympathy for him without being distracted from the main storyline. On top of this Danny Glover puts in a strong performance as the family man Murtaugh and adds a certain lightness to the movie without making it any less gritty. I personally feel that the pairing of Gibson and Glover is one of the all time greats in cinema, the characters of Riggs and Murtaugh go together exceptionally and the eventual trust and friendship that grows between the two is almost a beautiful thing to behold. A rather ingenious soundtrack really helps to add an air of humanity to certain scenes and compliments the Gibson/Glover partnership perfectly on many occasions. Credit must also go to Mitch Ryan who played Captain McAllister and Gary Busey who played Mr. Joshua as both portrayed their villainous characters magnificently and convincingly.The film moves at a steady pace and despite dragging on occasion is generally paced well enough to sustain the viewers interest. There is a lack of action early on in the movie but this does not hamper &#145;Lethal Weapon' in any way. The first half of the movie is almost more like a drama as we have to see if Riggs can keep his head together long enough for the duo to solve the crime. It's in the first half of the movie that the audience is treated to many emotional moments as the character of Riggs is fully investigated by director Richard Donner (this in my opinion is one of Donner's best films) and writer Shane Black. We learn so much about both characters in the first half that when the action portion of the movie gets going it's almost impossible not to feel for these characters who are putting their lives on the line. Donner's direction is exceptional though sometimes he lets himself down a little with some poor choices for camera angles or somewhat slow direction.There are few faults to this movie though people expecting gunfight after gunfight and explosion after explosion may be a little disappointed. Also the occasional dragging of the storyline makes some parts of the movie a little tedious, but overall the screenplay is very tight and there is a lot of useful and realistic dialogue. I would certainly recommend this to action movie fans and casual moviegoers. For fans of this I recommend the first two sequels as well.

Now, I've gotten around to seeing the initial one, which brought together Danny Glover playing a cop just turning 50, getting a new partner, played by Mel Gibson, who had recently lost his wife in a car accident and was considered crazy by the other cops who knew him. I haven't seen all of Mel Gibson's roles, but I have seen quite a few of them and I believe his role as Martin in this film might be his best ever. The DVD picture is only average as DVDs go, but it has a 5.1 surround sound which is quite good for a film that was not originally released in surround sound.some SPOILERS FOLLOW, please don't read further unless you have seen the movie.The film opens with a girl apparently high on drugs, half-naked, dreamily dives off the high balcony onto the roof of a car below. Her death becomes the mystery to be solved, intertwined with a large drug operation her father is involved in and run my ex-military covert operatives. Gibson's character is introduced at a sniper shooting, he was going to walk off until he saw a wounded child, then went into the open, yelled at the sniper, then pumped about 30 rounds into him from his automatic pistol. He had been a top marksman in the military.Glover's character is introduced as part of his family, he is opposite Gibson's, a by-the-book type of guy. Often making the reference, I'm too old for this $hit. The unlikely pair make a good team, get the bad guys. In a great last scene fight, reportedly choreographed and filmed over four dusk to dawn days, Gibson's character takes out Busey's, both of them former special forces combat experts.Other highlights - Gibson talks to a jumper, offers a cig, handcuffs them togther, If you jump now, you will kill me, and that's murder, and murder of a cop, at that.  Then they jump, into an inflated mat.  The meeting bad guys in the dry lake bed, Gibson picking off several of them with his sniper rifle. Walking up to the prostitute's house, it explodes.

In addition, if you're not able to take a classic action buddy cop movie of all time, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.Lethal Weapon (1987) is my favorite classic action the best Christmas flick alongside Die Hard! It was always my favorite action flick from Richard Donner and Shane Black beside Superman (1978). If the Godfather is the Godfather of all gangster flicks, then Lethal Weapon is the Godfather of all buddy-buddy action cop flicks! In the summer of '87 director Richard Donner gave us Riggs and Murtaugh. Lethal Weapon is one of the Greatest Action Movies from the 80's. This is the movie I grew up and it is my childhood movie! You should know all of the great action movies Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, Dirty Harry, etc. This movie is a classic. Movie was the best cop movie EVER! It showed that cops are human too and have the same faults as the rest of us. The action scenes were great and keep you engaged through the whole movie. Gary Busey and Danny Glover both started in Predator 2. I think the man Gary Busey is very underrated actor for playing action hero's and villains. I think he did the best job ever. I seriously love him in Lethal Weapon and Predator 2! The first one in the Lethal Weapon series is a really fun 80s action flick! It's one of my favorite action movies of all time. I love this movie to death I love it!!! And the chemistry between Danny Glover and Mel Gibson is just flawless. The deserts scenes are outstanding and really fantastic in which Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Murtaugh (Danny Glover) attempt to rescue Murtaugh's daughter Rianne (Traci Wolfe) in the desert, Riggs provides cover for Murtaugh using a Heckler & Koch PSG-1 sniper rifle with a high-capacity magazine and Harris bipod. He succeeds in taking out several Shadow Company goons and is about to shoot Mr. Joshua when General McAllister (Mitchell Ryan) interferes and captures him, later seen carrying the rifle across his back while escorting the captured Riggs. Lethal Weapon is the 1987 action film that was one of the first in the modern buddy cop genre. Mel Gibson stars as LAPD Detective Martin Riggs, a cop who lives on the ragged edge and who could be suicidal, much to the chagrin of his new partner Sergeant Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover), who is celebrating his 50th birthday. Together they uncover a drug smuggling ring that involves a criminal gang comprised of mercenaries and former members of a CIA / special forces Black Ops unit with ties to the Vietnam War. The film was written by Shane Black and directed by Richard Donner (Superman The Movie). The success of the movie would help spawn a film franchise that spanned four films as well as numerous movie imitators. Of course, this wouldn't be an action movie without some action. There's plenty of it, and it's perfectly done. The stunts are completely insane in scale (at one point, McAllister has no control over the accelerator and brake pedals, so he can only steer as the car enters a main street, where it's t-boned by a large bus and flipped over. The general is upside down, bleeding, surrounded by bags of drugs and several grenades. When McAllister is trying to reach and grabbing the grenades, they all explode, destroying the car and him). The gunplay is delivered in perfect Richard Donner style (as opposed to the slo-mo John Woo-style) -- you'll see lots of heavy automatic and explosive weapons, and you'll see them used well. The film is violent, and bloody, but ALL of the mean-spirited violence is dealt by the evil characters, not the ones you root for (Quentin Tarantino fans sorry). And then the truly amazing scenes that bypass acting are shocking and memorable. In the Murtaugh's house the wall of the living room caves in and an empty police car crashes into the room, a police baton wedged onto the accelerator. Mr. Joshua (Gary Busey) shoots a T.V. displaying a Christmas commercial with his Colt XM177 Commando at Murtaugh's home and fires all round in the police car. The fighting sequences between Joshua (Gray Busey) and Riggs (Mel Gibson) is very realistic! You don't see any realistic fighting scenes in any action movie like that! This movie is the best action packed filled with a lot of entrainment, excitement, joy, laughs and a lot of action sequences! It is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors, stunts, great acting, the flying sequences between Riggs and suicide jumper is outstanding but a really crazy stunt, I have ever seen. Without the vision, this film would be nothing. I love this movie, it is the finest action movie of all time ever made!!!!! This first entry in the series that would spawn 3 sequels and countless duplicates, is the darker of the set. But the action and violence is played up and this one is a classic from first view to the next. 10/10 Grade Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio Warner Bros.

LAPD Sergeant Murtaugh (Danny Glover) is a middle-aged (altough Glover was actually only sweet 40 at the time of filming) cop with a large family and the world's worst cook for a wife. He has to team up with Sergeant Riggs, a young buck from a Special Forces background, who has gone mental following the death of his young wife.Just the opening scene, where a young hooker jumps to her death, is outstanding. At the beginning of this scene you might still be chatting with your friends about where to go afterwards, but at the end of this scene you will be firmly sitting in your seat and staring at the screen. And I may not be the hugest Mel Gibson fan, but his acting here is very impressive. There is a scene where he attempts to muster the courage to shoot himself in the head; this scene is crucial to the credibility of the entire movie, and there is one way of doing it right and a thousand of doing it wrong, but Gibson gets it spot-on. Glover is equally outstanding as the good-hearted, amiable guy who feels he's getting too old for this sh*t. A difficult role to play next to Riggs' atom bomb of a character without going under or seeming like a douchebag.Anyroads, this film has it all great acting, great plot, great cinematography, great atmosphere, it's all just so damn right and fine. You'd think that this movie was safely on its way to cinematic greatness when suddenly, inexplicably, it starts to suck harder than Monica Lewinsky trying to beat an octopus to it. It kind of starts in the scene where Hunsacker reveals his role as a drug trafficker and then is murdered by being shot from a helicopter. While drinking eggnog. But the story really jumps the shark in the desert lake scene, where oldtimer Murtaugh keeps a whole squad of heavily-armed mercenaries who are equipped with a freakin' helicopter AND holding his darling daughter hostage in check by threatening to blow us all up with a single hand-grenade.It's as if the studio had decided that this movie has been great enough so far, let's just roller-coaster it home. I don't know what happened here behind the scenes, but in a nutshell a great movie for about one hour, then terribly sucky in its denouement. Still, for the cop-action-fan, it's recommended viewing.

Basically recently turned 50 family man cop Sergeant Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) is partnered up with Vietnam veteran and suicidal (since the death of his wife Victoria 'Vicky') cop Sergeant Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson). Together they are on a mission to stop crime in the local area, but more importantly to investigate a drugs (mainly heroin) ring and track the gang, known as Shadow Company down. Of course the gang's leader General Peter McAllister (Mitchell 'Mitch' Ryan) wants them dead, no matter what, so gun fights and explosions are to be expected along the way as Murtaugh and Riggs slowly get to like each other and go against the bad guys. Also starring Gary Busey as Mr. Joshua, Tom Atkins as Michael Hunsaker, Darlene Love as Trish Murtaugh, Traci Wolfe as Rianne Murtaugh, Jackie Swanson as Amanda Hunsaker, Damon Hines as Nick Murtaugh, Ebonie Smith as Carrie Murtaugh, Lycia Naff as Dixie and Steve Kahan as Captain Ed Murphy. The comedic buddy theme is very good between Gibson and Glover, the action and thrills are pretty good too, it is an enjoyable film. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Sound.

First of all we have the maverick cop on the edge who doesn't play by the rules but gets results. Second we have him being teamed up with a by-the-book partner. Third...it's all about drugs. There are countless more, from LA setting to the Vietnam vet psycho stuff and even all the way down to the deep voiced trailer guy saying stuff like 'They'll have to work together even if it kills them' and so-forth.Opening with long travelling shot of LA, complete with an agonizingly 80s credit front, Lethal Weapon begins with the death of a porn actress, high on cocktail of white powders, who thinks she can fly. But what she really gets is a 20-storey descent to the parking lot, the fast way. I first saw Lethal Weapon on TV in about 1990 and this scene had pretty much everything cut from it, the nudity, the drugs, it's amazing people actually made sense of films back then.Anyways, before I go off on a tangent rant, the dead girl is actually the daughter of a crooked banker involved in heroin smuggling. LAPD Sargeant Roger Murtaugh is his old pal and takes the case, but not before being teamed-up with renegade, suicidal cop Martin Riggs. Together 'They don't make the rules, they break them' and 'They'll have to survive each other first' and 'blah blah blah!' Honestly, the wafer-thin plot of Lethal Weapon has truly perished with time. Bad guys smuggle heroin, cops kill them for it. There are multiple, totally absurd elements such as Riggs being a Vietnam vet despite only being about 30 at the time (meaning he was 19 when the conflict ended), the rolling around with the gun firing a gun blindly but still hitting targets is hard to swallow, the martial arts showdown seems to come out of nowhere and belongs in a different film, kids recognizing tiny special forces tattoos from a significant distance and the contrived death of Murtaugh's daughter's never seen boyfriend.In fact, a LOT of this film is contrived and rather ramshackle. Shane Black IS a great writer but this film is just too underdeveloped. We never get to see the heroin or learn anything about how the villains do business. There's not any decent amount of mystery solving or police procedure and there is absolutely NO reason at all for the film being set at Christmas. There is no festive, yuletide atmosphere or Xmasy themes. Plus, with the film being set in LA, Christmas is all blue skies and sun. It adds nothing at all.What makes Lethal Weapon watchable however are the characters and the silly banter between them. Riggs and Murtaugh really seem to click with each other as pals and I think it's this that kept the sequels coming rather than the need to tell another macho action story set in LA.And I do wish that Michael Kamen never used those damn saxophones! The score can frequently be quite jarring and annoying whenever those things start screeching. I have the limited edition score CD, but skip those tracks whenever I stick it on. But since Kamen has died in recent years I will spare him my rant over his misjudged score.Unwisely regarded as a classic, Lethal Weapon only exhibits how to weave 40 million clichés into a macho action movie. The humor is what I like best, I can leave the rest to stagnate back in the 80s, where it really belongs.

Maybe I should give it another watch now, but my intuition tells me it still sucks. Truth be told, Lethal Weapon 1 isn't an especially good movie, either, though the final installment (so far!) makes it look like a masterpiece. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover play chatterbox cops who are total opposites in life and style but, of course, are made partners. This probably wasn't the first buddy cop movie, but it is the most influential. Shane Black, who later went on to write and direct the superior Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, wrote a sometimes witty script which is also often ridiculous, repetitive, convoluted and just plain dumb. Richard Donner is one of the best popcorn directors, but a lot of Lethal Weapon feels overstuffed to me. There's just too much going on in many scenes, and the exaggerated performances of the two leads, along with their rapid-fire and frequently incomprehensible dialogue, I was getting a tad annoyed. But never that annoyed. With all its flaws, Lethal Weapon is nothing less than a good bit of entertainment.

Gibson takes centre stage as suicidal LA detective Martin Riggs, allowing him free rein to explode into the claustrophobic surroundings in which he finds himself.Partnering Gibson, his 'straight man' as it were, is Danny Glover as Sgt Roger Murtagh, a veteran cop who is less than pleased to find himself paired with Riggs. The 'buddy' nature of the partnership, shifting from suspicion, to dislike, to liking, back to antagonism, and finally to respect, friendship, and trust, is a formula which has often been imitated, but never bettered. The chemistry between Gibson and Glover is instantly evident, and throughout the film the tension generated by placing two such nominally dissimilar characters together is rarely far from the surface.The dual layered plot, which initially and mostly focuses on the attempts of Riggs to overcome the depression which has settled over his life since the death of his wife, is an important feature of the film, and one that would be repeated successfully in the sequels. Gradually, as the partnership builds around a murder case of an old friend of Murtagh's, a criminal mercenary heroin running scheme is uncovered by the duo, who find themselves targeted, not for the last time in the series, by the bad guys. Of course, there is plenty of action, including drive-by shootings, fly-by shootings, fist fights, and explosions, but in this first instalment of the series, the best moments are saved for darker instances of tension between characters.The one false note struck in LETHAL WEAPON is the repeated references to the Vietnam War, in which Riggs, Murtagh, and the head bad guy Mr Joshua (Gary Busey in a menacing but not overused appearance), are meant to have served. Not only are all three men clearly too young to have been in Vietnam, but the ties of Gibson's former special forces unit to the mercenary operation and the murder case are skimmed over too briefly, and could have done with deeper exploration, especially through the 'fleshing out' of key villains, such as Mr Joshua. A belated attempt to look at the US Special Forces abusing the narcotics laws was made in 1990 with Air America, also starring Gibson.On the whole, this is a very enjoyable action film, with far less of the comedic element than was to follow, with only Riggs' lighter moments during his depression to provide relief from the drama. For an uncomplicated, powerful, and above all fun thrill ride, you can't do much better than LETHAL WEAPON! "},{"Title":"Lethal Weapon!

Now in my mid-twenties I almost fell asleep watching it, the only reason I stayed awake was out of shock that such a stale and monotonous film is considered an action classic today.What was original about Lethal Weapon when it came out? Perhaps the unusual cop duo set in a seemingly realistic crime plot - which I realize has since probably inspired all the later films with that same ingredient. So I give it credit for that. Nonetheless I can't give it more than the average 5/10. I found the crime plot uninteresting, and the dialog now feels so cliché and outdated that if it were released today it would probably receive much ridicule. Some scenes are absolutely ludicrous, like when Gibson threatens to kill himself while Glover encourages him, or the final fight scene (Gibson going personal, and the cops just agreeing to watch them get it on...). This wouldn't be so awful to me if there were other good scenes to make up for the bad ones, but I honestly can't think of one memorable and good scene.I admit though, that I'm not so much into generic cop films which rely almost exclusively on action. Straightforward gun-shooting action tends to bore me unless a scene is particularly impressive or original in some way. Caring for the characters is also necessary to enjoy the action sequences. Unfortunately, I didn't care for any of the characters in Lethal Weapon, and wasn't impressed by the discreet attempts at humor.To each his own I guess.

Lethal Weapon has the markings of a typical 80s factory stamped action movie and it could have disappeared into obscurity, were it not for the two people at its centre Mel Gibson and Danny Glover.Lethal Weapon is what has become known as a buddy-cop movie. The thing you need for a buddy cop movie is two good actors with a bit of chemistry and that is exactly what these two folks gave us.

It certainly delivers in terms of action and barely concealed man love.One of the most telling things about Lethal Weapon is that Gibson is introduced in the nude and that the first shot of Glover shows him in the bath. We're not talking action here. We're talking lurve, a love that transcends age, race and supposed heterosexuality. Don't believe me? Well, how does Riggs (Gibson) come to terms with the death of his wife? Over time? By finding another woman? No, Riggs only overcomes his suicidal urges after a big manly hug (while soaking wet) on his partner's lawn and after being welcomed into his partner's home. He doesn't need his wife anymore. He has a new beau.And going to the start of the film, what's the first thing that Riggs and Murtaugh (Glover) talk about when they're teamed up? They talk about their 'guns' &#150; size, age etc. And they even go to a firing range together. Here we get to see their guns in action and how potent they are with their weapon. Of course, Murtaugh thinks he's hot stuff, but he's an old codger and the young buck can hit the target from a much greater distance. Needless to say, Murtaugh is impressed. The date went well.But the lengths that Gibson goes to in order to protect his dear one are rather extreme. He even endures electrocution &#150; topless, of course, with his ripped torso showing and with water cascading over his fine mullet and impressive abs. But he never betrays his partner and he kills the bad guy with his thighs. Impressive. And after that he fights the dastardly Mr Joshua on his partner's muddy lawn &#150; again while soaking wet and again choking a man with his thighs. I guess Riggs likes having a man's head between his legs. But the two detectives kill Joshua together. They're officially a couple.But the film's not entirely about man love. There's action too. And it's to the film's credit that none of the action is too preposterous (by 80s standards, at least). Yes you get helicopters that can sneak up on cliff-side mansions without making a noise and yes people can take severe beatings and still get up for more, but there are no Die Hard-style flights of fancy (as fun as they are, though). In fact, the best bit of action is the famous jumper scene. Riggs handcuffs himself to a suicidal man and leaps off a side of a building with him. It's just damn funny. However, I do have to point out that I prefer Dirty Harry's style of negotiation. He doesn't bother with handcuffs or theatrics. He just taunts the jumper, makes him jump onto the cherry picker and then punches him out. Splendid. But I heartily endorse either style of policing.I also endorse the rather sadistic aspects of the film. There's one bit when you see the bad guys rubbing salt into Murtaugh's wounds. I like that. I like that a lot. And I like it because it makes you root for the good guys even more. You want them to blow these guys away. And that's what you need for a good action film. You don't want to be passive. You want to revel in the bloody death of bleach blonde drug runners and their Charlton Heston look-a-like bosses.Earlier I mentioned Die Hard. The two films actually have quite a bit in common. Not only are they both set during Christmas, not only are they both set in Los Angeles, not only do they have the main henchman make a surprise resurrection at the end, but they also have pretty much the same score. I guess Michael Kamen, when Die Hard came around a year after Lethal Weapon, was so lacking in inspiration when called to make a second Christmas action score that he recycled it. But I guess it's not too much of a problem. It's a good score. And at least Lethal Weapon, unlike Die Hard, has the benefit of Eric Clapton's twangy guitar and some weeping saxophones. (What is it with cops and saxophones? The two are inextricably linked. I guess its because the saxophone is the instrument of depression and sleaze.) But to go with the action and the saxophones, you also have some enjoyably awful lines. Murtaugh says to a hooker, All dressed up and no one to blow. And when freeing his partner, Riggs says, Let's do what one shepherd said to the other shepherd. 'Let's get the flock out of here.' Groansome, yes, but enjoyably so.However, the script isn't as convincing when it tries for emotion. Riggs' yearning for his wife is certainly rather by the numbers. You know that he's going to get over it and you know its there just to try and give the film an added edge. Or more accurately, it's the film's justification for Riggs' craziness &#150; the film has little interest in exploring Riggs' emotions, it just wants a crazy cop. Better, though, is the bonding between the two cops. Gibson and Glover certainly have chemistry and the family scenes have a warmth that you rarely see in these sorts of films. Which I guess is the reason why their man love is still so enjoyable to watch.
