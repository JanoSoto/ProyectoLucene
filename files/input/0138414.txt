The one word that best describes it is 'honest'....but it's also nostalgic, funny, wonderfully simple, yet beautifully complex. The viewer can start off enjoying how accurately it captures the mid 80's, especially the excitement and uncertainty that Eric, the main character, is experiencing. Then, as the story unfolds, each new development that Eric deals with as he comes to terms with being gay is so well done, so honest and nontheatrical, that it feels almost like a documentary. The movie's got a huge heart. Don't miss it!!!

I adore this movie, it was my life. Eric's discovery of his sexuality one summer while working at Cedar Point in Sandusky Ohio is almost exactly how I discovered mine. I thought as I watched it that someone had stolen my journal, wrote a script about it, and then silently returned it without my knowing. Eric's first love. His making friends at a bar he was not old enough to be in. His developing style, in the way many of us did in the 80's, bad hair and worse clothes, but great music.I could relate to this movie on so many levels. I think that any gay man that found himself in the 80's should watch this film and see where they fit into it.

On a thematic par with the Brit import GET REAL, this film touches on the reality of coming of age in 1984 mid-America, though I suspect it is pretty much the same in any American suburb.  The competition must discount Britain's BEAUTIFUL THING which is really an out and out romance. But it beats the cardboard contrivances of DEFYING GRAVITY, a collegiate scenario of similar ilk.The awkward flirty moments building up to the first boy/boy coupling have an air of sexy familiarity.  Film's presumption that all some guys want is sex is (unfortunately) dead on real.  Chris Stafford plays the leading teen with immense charm.  We'll see more from Stafford, surely.  His studly co-star is suitably entrancing and is fine to look from the back during their love scenes.  We certainly understand why our hero falls for this college-age cad.Naturally there's a gal pal, too, who here is underplayed nicely but a little too Winona-like for comfort.  Broadway uber-dyke Lea DeLaria is onboard for yuks but is just a little too odd and urban to blend in a Sandusky supermarket.  Gay men will get teary as Stafford fesses up to Mom that he's queer.  Film's only flaw is some obviously clipped editing.  At least two scenes are confusing in continuity leading us to wonder whahappened???But EDGE OF SEVENTEEN is a winner.  Gay or straight, first love and coming of age are themes that hit home.

I enjoyed it the first time, but where I am older now and myself am coming out of my shell more (pun intended) as Eric did, I had a greater appreciation of it this time around. I was five years old at the time this movie took place in 1984, and remember some of those tunes from the wonderful and fun soundtrack, but more because I have downloaded them from the internet in recent years. (ssssh) The gay bar in the movie looked like so much fun, especially during that era of glam and new wave. The scenes there strongly resonated with me, especially when Eric first goes there after a high school party where he is called queer by the guy he was eying and appears somewhat nervous before opening the door and walking inside (I know the feeling), and when Eric instantly made friends there (it helped that he already knew a patron, his boss, Angie (played by the entertaining, if crude, Lea DeLaria), from the fast food joint he worked at with Maggie (Tina Holmes) and Rod (Andersen Gabrych). Also, his gradual evolution into his true self, both literally and figuratively, struck a chord as well. It is difficult to keep up appearances and to suppress who one truly is because of how one is socialized and expected to be. It can be, for some, life-threatening and tragically for others, life-ending.Also, anyone straight or gay can relate to meeting that person (for Eric it was Rod) who knocks your socks (block?) off and who becomes your first love, whether you consummate that mutual attraction or not. Eric is lucky; he got to be with Rod, even if not permanently. The three main characters were very attractive and appealing and acted quite well for an independent feature. Stafford was good in depicting the struggle with one's sexuality that many of us experience and the added pressure of having to conform to what our parents, peers, and society in general expect of us when it isn't exactly what we feel on the inside or want to be. Gabrych was a sexy seducer with a killer smile, and Holmes portrayed a straight girl in love with her gay best friend (Stafford) touchingly. The scene after they consummate their relationship shows Eric clearly disoriented and one could tell by the expression on his face that he knew he was gay and that heterosexual sex wasn't going to do it for him. (Another moment I can relate to.) After all, I really wanted to be in Eric's place in his bed next to that sultry babe.

I can recall dressing outrageously and experimenting with my hair to make a statement just as Eric does and then denying that I was gay.Yes, some men are portrayed as queenish and promiscuous, but that's because some real men are.

Something about the fact that it was based in the eighties made me a little edgy about seeing it. But I was actually pleasantly surprised.Chris Stafford, who I would very much like to see in bigger roles, presented an incredible portrayal of a young man struggling with his sexuality in a very bias environment. Not only did I enjoy the way his character gradually came out of his shell and embraced this part about him that he had tried so hard to deny for so long but I was just so entranced and surprised by his performance throughout the film.Anderson Gabrych as Rod was equally amazing. I was a little put off by him at first and I was extremely wary of that stereotypical gay he seemed to be at first introduction but I really enjoyed his performance, as well. And Tina Holmes was wonderful as Eric's best friend and her difficulty with the fact that the man she was in love with didn't love her that way was incredibly believable.I enjoyed each actor's portrayal of their character and the flawless acting and the sexy (but tasteful) love scenes and just about everything about the film. The only thing I did not enjoy was the end. It felt awkward and cut short and if the director was aiming for a cliffhanger, he certainly succeeded - but a little too much was left unsaid for a completely successful closing.Overall, the movie was one that I will watch many, many more times. It's an emotional, realistic insight into the struggles of coming out and embracing one's sexuality. Definitely worth the watch.

Screenwriter Todd Stephens' choice of era (80's) to showcase his story can not be any more appropriate, drawing  a parallel between the struggle of a young gay man in coming to terms with his sexuality and a nation in realizing all that glitters is not gold.  Both required the courage to honestly looked at the truth, and this is ultimately what Edge of Seventeen managed to accomplish.  Quite often in the world of celluloid, being gay is reduced to being comical, sacchrined, or romantically bleak. Director David Moreton knew better.  He chose to give us a multi-faceted depiction of gay experience instead.  There's a bit of tears, some heartaches, a tinge of angst, a sense of loss, and a healthy dose of laughter;  Kudos to the entire cast for their wonderful performances.  The lead character could not have been played better by Chris Stafford, who has the incredible ability to convey such wide range of emotions/reactions, from being speechlessly moved with a sense of implicit pressured in realizing how hard his parents have to work to send him to college, to being awkwardly pleasured during a post-clubbing front-seat rimming session.  Tina Holmes also delivered an outstanding performance as the girlfriend of the lead. Instead of playing it like a stereotypical witty and I've-got-ten-thousand-comeback-line faghag, Holmes' Maggie is every bit as complex as the young man in the spotlight.  At times, she reminded me of a young Meryl Streep, with her dead-on display of subtle emotional shifts.

It also has a few genuine laugh moments, many I've been there too scenes, and very likeable performances by all the leads. The film takes a misstep in the sex scenes. The one in the dorm room has no reason to exist. What does it add to the story or its characters? Several people were either using the rest room---or they agreed with me. They walked out as the scene progressed. Lea DeLaria is a blast as the gung-ho lesbian cafeteria manager. She is both funny and warm. Chris Stafford is mesmerizing as Eric. A positive review in the Seattle Times compared him to Montgomery Clift---in both physical appearance and ability to convey conflicting emotions with his expressions. So, the entire film I had the feeling I'd seen Stafford before...but it was really Clift I was thinking of. Stafford is very brave here, asked to do some pretty awkward things in the name of the character---and doing them with simplicity and charm. It is a shame that more money was not spent by Strand releasing on both a better sound track dubbing and more publicity. The poster for the film is like an afterthought---probably a foot by a foot in size. It didn't come close to filling the poster sign board. But, Edge of Seventeen will undoubtably fill a void in the lives of some teens currently trying to come out in little town USA. Or perhaps fill the void many of us felt for NOT coming out as teens in the glam '80's.

Not once during the outstanding film Edge of Seventeen was I even tempted - and that is one of the film's main strengths. Director David Moreton has given us an honest, completely believable story about a young man named Eric (Chris Stafford), still seventeen years old and in high school. Eric has a best friend, Maggie (Tina Holmes) and they do everything together - even getting a job at a local amusement park in the restaurant. One of Eric's co-workers is an unabashedly gay college student by the name of Rod (Anderson Gabrych), who immediately comes on to him. Eric, confused by his sexuality, finally succumbs to his urges and believes he's met the love of his life.Like Beautiful Thing, a British movie exploring the coming of age and coming out of young gay men, Edge of Seventeen features strong performances by its young actors in difficult roles. Tina Holmes, playing Maggie, reminds me of a good friend I once had during my coming out process. Chris Stafford, a dead ringer for David Bowie, is so utterly convincing in his role that I empathize with him completely. I think we were all once Eric, torn between our desire to please our parents and friends, and our need to be completely honest with ourselves. Eric experiments with many things - hairstyles, clothing (at one point he looks like Boy George), the local gay bar - conveniently run by Lea DeLaria, the supervisor at his summer job.DeLaria, playing Angie, provides both comic relief and good advice in a sympathetic, no-nonsense character that made me wish for a mentor like her. Someone who was older, gay, and willing to listen so that I could vent my frustrations without having to feel scared or apologetic. Like all the characters in screenwriter Todd Stephens' script, Angie is both intellectually and emotionally honest, never resorting to cheap shenanigans or pointless mugging to get a laugh.The comedy in Seventeen is true - and so is the drama. Nothing seems forced or contrived here; the situation is all too familiar for that. When Eric finally tells his mother he's gay, she simply says, I know and gives him a big hug. Her next reaction, that of Where did I go wrong? is one that so many mothers have voiced and acted upon; our hearts all go out to her.I said earlier that one of the main strengths of Edge of Seventeen is that it never made me want to cry. For a movie that touches upon so many personal subjects - coming out, coming of age, loss of innocence - cheap sentimentality is a very easy route to go. By never resorting to this type of stunt, Edge of Seventeen becomes an elegant, moving tribute to one young man's personal odyssey. This film is an absolute must-see and is destined to stand up with Beautiful Thing and Lilies as classics of gay cinema.

For whatever reason I never did see it so I ordered the DVD online. In the mean time, I read the comments about this film here on IMDb. After reading the comments, I was afraid that I had wasted my money before I had even gotten my DVD in the mail! Fortunately, I don't agree with the negative comments that I read on this web site at all.Not all gay people grow up aware that they are gay from birth! Gay people come from all different backgrounds/parents/walks of life. I grew up in Warren, Michigan, which is about a three-hour drive from Sandusky, Ohio where this movie takes place. Michigan is like the Alabama of the North and VERY closeted! There are stereotypes of gay people, because there are gay people like that. Maybe this movie shows all those stereotypes, but I have met all those types of people in my life and this movie made perfect sense to me. Maybe it is sad to say for some people, but this movie was my life! I had to stop watching this movie several times because it was all too real. In 1984, I met my former girlfriend/wife and my best friend as Eric has in this movie. Annie Lennox and the Eurythmics were my favorite band in1984 and music was a very important part of my life. Annie is still my favorite Diva.Although I never worked at Cedar Point, I wanted to and went there almost every summer. I ended up losing my best friend, as the actor is this movie does and I found out the hard way that there are guys out there who will love you and leave you at the drop of a hat. The music, the actors, the story are great and very realistic. I would have LOVED to have this film in my life back then instead of a film like Last American Virgin or Porky's which made no sense to me at all because I could not relate.The acting during the bedroom scene between Eric and Maggie was perfect and very real/good. It was difficult for me to watch because it was so good. I don't know how anyone can say the acting was less than perfect/real for anyone in this film. Rod, Mom, the entire family and cast are very believable.I am not going to say this is the best movie ever made, but this film is NOT a Hollywood production and has a very tender way of showing what some (and I would guess what most people) go through when coming-out. The best example for me was when Eric goes to the record store to buy a Bronski Beat album and acts as though he were buying a porno magazine. Lea DeLaria is so great in this movie and I would have loved to have had someone like her in my life when I was coming out. I have seen a lot of movies gay and otherwise, and this movie while not full of special effects and razzle-dazzle, IT IS full of plenty of emotions and HEART. Very worthwhile to see!!! Very REAL!!!

I was ultimately very disappointed and found myself wondering up to the last few minutes of the film, I wonder when this will turn around and surprise me. If you're looking for a love story between two boys, pass on this one - you're looking for Maurice or My Beautiful Laundrette.Edge... is modest and has a sole purpose, trying to say there are people out there who are like you to those who need to hear it the most. How absolutely important it is to communicate that message to young people trying to make it in these times, I cannot even begin to describe - but this movie did it poorly and in a shallow way, sacrificing the relatable for hungry love scenes and arc upon arc of one-night stands. Eric's irrelevant friendship and oddly specific boy drama in his personal life dominate the screen rather than addressing the finding and accepting of sexuality in a coming-of-age.I found a few things to be particularly bothersome from the film(spoilers ahead.)Half of the movie is spent on showing a shallow relationship that is too fast, too one-dimensional, too inconsistent, and comes across as childish. It was showing meaningless, cheesy scenes between these two boys who hardly even knew each other giving goo-goo eyes off-and-on when it could have been fleshing out the weaker points of the film.Eric is used for sexual pleasure by numerous other boys, made fun of by the kids at school, and loses his best friend, and there is no glimmer of hope by the end, no silver lining, no promise that he will find his calling and stand tall. Edge... is absent of hopefulness, and that is where it falls short as a film.Chris Stafford and Andersen Gabrych's performances were lackluster, absent of chemistry, and amateur.It fails to teach what is most important, saying find a good gay bar, a drink, and a guy for the night, and then you'll be fine when it should have said you have a place in life and you will find it, it does get better.I'm giving Edge of Seventeen four stars because I'd hoped that some people would get comfort from this film, and I can see in the past reviews that it does. Its obligatory plot and cookie-cutter characters were too bland for me, but if you feel you could relate, by all means, give this film a try - you just wouldn't have my personal recommendation.

The situation is becoming more and more common. A teenager, a junior in his high school, discovers little by little he is attracted to men. He has a girl friend who would like the relation to go all the way, but he does not bring it there which makes him start wondering.Then he is thrown into the gay world by accident, the way most things happen in life. His first man is a sweet and maybe slightly weak predator, a senior in his high school, and a colleague at his summer workplace. The young junior falls and the senior goes to college in September. Eric will have to live alone with his recollection, his desire and the demand from his mother and society to have a normal life with a girl friend and all the rest that goes along with it. Maggie will play what she still does not know is a game.Then all that happens is accidental till it becomes a real choice. Later he will run away from a straight party when he is called a queer because he dances in a rather exuberant way. He goes to a gay night club or bar where he meets someone. The next stage later on will be to run after his first male lover and to get it finished physically and emotionally right through to the end of the physical act and to the final closure of the emotional experience.Then he will try to go back to a normal straight life and have a night with his girl friend, Maggie. But in the morning he will feel no satisfaction, no fulfillment. He will know then lying is no solution and he will move towards telling his mother and then going back to where he finds his full both physical and emotional nourishment.The film is then interesting because it describes the slow change that occurs in Eric with total sympathy and even empathy. Eric is living what practically all human beings have lived or deserve living the slow awakening of desire and search for satisfaction of that desire, the desire to be appealing to someone else, the desire to answer to the ones who are appealing to him, the desire to feel happy and satisfied when he meets with that mutual appeal which is first of all a strong emotion that becomes a passion. Then the physical act is like natural.This is not typical of gay men, but any man feels that transformation no matter who is the object of the nascent passion. I guess it is also the same thing for women though the film does not insist on the case of the Lesbian friend of Eric's and only shows the deception and frustration of Maggie when she realizes her appeal has been hijacked by Eric.This film insists on the role of the mother that moves from open hostility to acceptance without the know-how required by such a disquieting situation. If the mother accepts her son's choice, she will have to defend him and it when confronted to the dubitative hostility of other parents, not to speak of the open hostility of other teenagers, some school officials, PTA members, church representatives, etc.A good film on the problem and necessity to come out as soon as the appeal starts moving in you, though you need a confident, an accomplice, someone who understands and supports you in that transformation. Coming out is hard.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU "},{"Title":"Could have been better","Date":"19 June 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" It could just be me, but I failed to appreciate the way in which this movie was developed.

I first saw this movie when I was still well in the closet and its portrayal of coming out terrified me. I would say this movie focuses on all the wrong parts of coming out. Yes it is difficult, and yes many times those you care about won't react how you would like, but there is an inherent freedom that comes along with it. I would like to tell the creators how much coming out has changed since they did it.

He and his best friend, Maggie (Tina Holmes), get summer jobs in an amusement park barbecue house, where they meet Rod (Andersen Gabrych), an openly gay college student, and their boss, Angie (Lea DeLaria), a butch lesbian with a heart of gold. What happens to this group of people, and particularly to Eric and Maggie, is by turns funny, wrenching, (homo)erotic, and ultimately quite moving. Stafford and Holmes give real breakthrough performances. Stafford is particularly fine as he maneuvers his way through his sexual identity crisis and physically changes before our eyes. DeLaria adds needed levity and strong support. Perhaps because I grew up very near Sandusky and went through some of the same crises, the movie affected me quite a bit.

First, there is an expert balance of nostalgia, humor and angst--which prevents it from becoming cloying, saccharine or self-pitying.  Second, the setting is one that has not been well covered in this sub-genre before--as is evident from some of the ignorant comments on this site and in other reviews (more on that later).  Third, the characters are achingly real, not stereotypes, overly fabulous or nihilistically and fashionably ironic.Some complain that the editing is choppy and amateurish.  It is true that the editing is not as smooth as your basic Hollywood feature, but is that necessarily a critique?  Indies should operate as an alternative to the homogeneous films of Hollywood--in style as well as content.  The less than smooth cutting, among other things, keeps your attention and refuses to let you sit back and simply absorb what your being fed.Finally, some here and elsewhere have suggested that a small town in Ohio is too provincial to have had such things as a gay bar and poppers.  I have to admit a certain amount of bias in regard to the film here.  For I, like the writer, grew up in Ohio.  In fact I grew up in Sandusky, Ohio, worked at the amusement park, and knew Todd Stephens as well.  Unfortunately, I failed to realize (or accept) at the time how similar our situations were, and I haven't seen him since graduation.  As a former resident of Sandusky, I will admit that the gay culture of a place like Sandusky is in many ways much different and much smaller than that of a big city like New York, San Francisco or even Philadelphia.  However, this fact does not make living in Sandusky akin to living in medieval Europe.  There were and are gay bars in Sandusky.  Unfortunately, the one depicted in the movie (with a very slight name change) closed and was torn down in the late 80's.  But there are still others.  Further, Ohio was where I discovered poppers, not New York.  These perceptions of an overly-provincial Ohio are due to nothing more than big city bigotry.

His chameleon transformation from the boy next door living in the US Midwest to his Boy George persona were quite remarkable.  He certainly had an amazing screen presence and looks very attractive in the role.  The transformation certainly happened quickly and he became a different person when he first donned the mascara.  The scene at the high school house party was incredibly well performed with the self revelation of his gayness followed by his dance fevered frenzy marred only by the cruel comments of his fellow students. His mother does not even notice the change until quite late in the movie while his father plays a back seat role in the family and dealing with his son's dilemma.  Tina Holmes (as Maggie) was very impressive in her role as the girlfriend (the fag hag) looking very much like Winona Ryder.  The emotions expressed by Eric and Maggie were very realistic and heartfelt. Lea SeLaria was good in her role although she could have added a little more wisdom to her advice. The only disappointment was the ending without any certain closure on the issues of finding a true love (whether he finds love with Jonathan and how he deals with Rod at college) and the resolution with his parents. As a low budget independent movie, it was a remarkable achievement.  I find it difficult for people to expect more in the famine land of compassionate gay movies.  It travels more dramatic and different ground to the UK Beautiful Thing and Get Real (both favorites of mine) but this provides more real life drama, is more erotically charged and sexy, and is more daring in its portrayal of the anguish and confusion faced by the young gay boy. The movie is a real gem and an unfinished masterpiece for a film of its type - highly recommended.  Edge of Seventeen is the best of its type in a wasteland of gay movies, a welcome change from the Hollywood block buster or even the New York/LA based gay scene movies.

It's like someone decided that the public (obviously with a focus on the gay community) needed to have the message of 'Coming out is a difficult, awkward, and strange period!' into everyone's head, and to that end, one plot was slowly improved, expounded, and brought to realistic terms over the period of three movies.Everyone knows the basic story.  Everyone can figure out the times when our protagonist will be shoved into an uncomfortable situation.  That's because we've already seen it in other movies, albeit not as well done.  Sure, I appreciate the fact that movies like this are coming out (pun unintended), from both the standpoint of growing tolerance and a point of focus for confused teens, but that's where my patience ends.It's time for some originality, and placing the movie in the campy '80's doesn't count.  How about a plot concerning a gay kid that has a troubled background and is unstable and aggressive?  Or the kid who's already out and comfortable with himself dealing with the annoyance of finding someone to date in high school, or finding someone to date, but having to deal with the frustrating fact that the other person's in the closet?  Or how religion affects a gay kid, in or out?

The film has many winning elements, including  a solid feeling for life in dull, Middle American Sandusky, Ohio, and an appearance by often praised Lesbian comedian Lea DeLaria.The material, however, smacks of being auto-biographical to a fault, and herein lies the problem.  The hero, Eric, (Chris Stafford) is a sensitive, somewhat timid lad with ambitions of becoming a professional musician.  The virtually plotless film follows the course of his last year of high school. We see Eric gradually come to grips with his gay orientation and start to discover the gay community around him.  Unfortunately, he turns from sweet and sensitive to a shallow, self-centered club kid clone, sporting a pseudo Boy George look.  True, disappointments and disillusionment cause him to rethink his life's course by the film's end (and, boy, did this kid need a class in Homosexuality 101!), but in the meanwhile his character has lost whatever audience empathy it had.  This led me to think that the screenwriter and/or director was personally too close to the material to see what an unappealing portrait they were creating in the lead character.The highly touted DeLaria lends the film some punch, but she is abrasive and not as amusing as the filmmakers seem to have intended.  Tina Holmes, playing Eric's best friend Maggie, turns in a nice, low-key performance, though her character ultimately gets handed the rawest deal by the self-absorbed Eric. The film's circa 1980 Midwestern details are evocative and well done, from the thrift store chic look affected by Eric and Maggie to the ticky-tacky appearance of the homes and the frenetic, shallow pace of the small town gay dancebar.  But the ending is abrupt and unsatisfying...did they run out of film?  Or did the budget dry up?A better exploration of the same subject matter can be found in the superior British film, Get Real.

It poignantly reminds us that coming out is never as simple as first uttering the words, I'm gay, but rather a life-long journey toward self-acceptance, cultural identity, and all too often a struggle for the love of one's own family. You won't be left nearly as elated as by The Truman Show's great outing; however, this film is certainly a must-see for gay or questioning youth, and equally rewarding for anyone seeking an accurate, honest understanding of the terrible anxieties of coming out.

He is led inexorably to face up to the strong impulses that are pulling him away from the comfortable relationship he has had with a female friend who wants more than friendship and from his mother who has difficulty understanding the changes she sees in her son.  The film is beautifully acted.  Sensitive viewers will react to the confusions and conflict that Eric experiences.

This film relies on the audience to be so starved of 'positive' representations of queer that they will accept any product, no matter how inferior.  Still, some of the boys are hot, and they show a bit more skin than in mainstream narrative cinema.  So, if you can choke down or ignore the sticky sweet sentimentality it's not an unamusing way to kill however long it is.

It's all decor and superficial. And incoherent to that. The list goes on and on. It's a redo of intelligent and successful European flicks put in American surroundings. But all plastic and jaded. Bad and flat acting. Do not watch this. There are much better coming of age movies. BEAUTIFUL THING might be a romance it's actually more realistic and has much more depth of character and intensity and coherence in the story. Societal stuff is also better and more comprehensibly (sometimes symbolic) interwoven in the story of BT. Although I didn't like GET REAL much for its preaching, I think even that movie is better than Edge of Seventeen; and better to understand (language) for American audiences than BT.

The main character starts to wear mascara dye his hair 4 colors and imitate I think David Bowie.Then there is the inevitable scene I dread in coming out movies where a young female love interest is told and is devastated usually in an understated suffering way. All of the hurt female love interest stuff and suffering parents is like torture for a gay male....who needs it? I honestly don't know why I rent these things, I know better. A movie like this is mostly boring. Make some movies where gayness is incidental to the plot not central to it and make them with entertaining heroes that would be nice. No rehash of the white picket fence please... nor yuppie marriages between a lawyer and doctor in a tasteful apartment....maybe someone along the lines of James Bond...Now we are talking liberation.

The main character, Eric, showed little or no angst about questioning his sexuality. Early in the film it didn't seem to be in question at all. The character shows no remorse and little feeling about all of the relationships (sexual and otherwise) he breezes through in the film, and the dialogue is terrible. I would say a notch above the dialogue in a porn movie. Speaking of porn, there is, admittedly, some beautiful footage of boys kissing, so if that's all you really want to see and you  have no care for the reality of such emotional situations, plot, or acting, rent this flick!

My favorite part of this movie is the fact that it doesn't answer all your questions or offer a happy ending.  All through my coming out process I've noticed that most characters in gay films are well-educated of the plight we face and have all the answers you'll ever need.  The movie showed me that sometimes things don't turn out alright, maybe your parents won't understand, sure you might lose your friends, and that no, the answers to everything aren't in a little package sold at Wally-World.  And thats all okay.

"},{"Title":"The best of its kind","Date":"16 January 2001","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  If you are like me and think that you have seen one too many gay coming-of-age films (i.e. Get Real or Beautiful Thing) and are getting tired of the whole cliche-ridden genre, then I urge you to take a chance on Edge of Seventeen.  You might walk away from it feeling refreshed and pleasantly surprised.Director David Moreton's honest and understated screenplay makes this film a cut above the rest.  It neither succumbs to cliche, nor does it it pander to the audience's expectations.  It also works in the film's favor that it doesn't aim to be a straight-friendly crowd pleaser.  Instead, it is a quieter and no-frills portrayal of what it is like to grow up as a gay teenager.  The sex scenes in Edge of Seventeen are also genuinely erotic and sensitively portrayed.  They are realistic not because they are graphic, but because of the emotional candor that comes from them.Edge of Seventeen is also extremely well-acted by a committed cast of actors, most of whom make their screen-acting debuts here.  Chris Stafford gives one of 1999's best performances as Eric.  What I liked about Eric is that Moreton does not paint him as a hero or a saint, but rather as a vulnerable kid who slowly tries to assert his sexuality, while not always making the right decisions.  It is also very moving to see how he struggles to find acceptance and validation not only from his family and his friend Maggie (played nicely by Tina Holmes) but also from his new gay peers.  The scene where he phones Rod on the pay phone is a good example of this.The ending is another reason why Edge of Seventeen stands out.  Rather than tying everything up in a neat, little resolution, it leaves many questions remaining, many issues left unresolved.  But it is still a satisfying ending because it gives the audience a sense of hope.  It doesn't ignore the fact that our decisions may bring about as many sacrifices as they do rewards.Ironically, I think the uncompromised honesty is the reason why it didn't do as well commercially as movies like Get Real and Beautiful Thing.  Unlike these two films, Edge of Seventeen is a more serious and understated film that doesn't rely on trite gay jokes and sassy fag hags and drag queens to get laughs.  In other words, it achieves its truthfulness by not reducing itself to a crowd pleaser.  Also, while the main character, Eric, is very likeable, he is not without flaw.  I think this makes it easier for a viewer to relate to Eric as he attempts to find self-acceptance and belonging.  For these reasons, Edge of Seventeen beathes life into the gay coming-of-age genre.

It in its own modern way reminded me of some comedy dramas I saw when I was 17 (& that is a very long while ago). Of course way back then our young hero would have been worried more about his  Zitz`s  instead of his coming out.  & he would have been romancing  more girls.I thoroughly enjoyed this & do recommend it to all discerning filmgoersThank YouJay Harris "},{"Title":"Skimming the surface of the 80s","Date":"11 April 2006","Score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" The better things about this movie were some of the performances (I would agree that Tina Holmes as Maggie was one of the best, a proved rationale for the reason that she, among all the principals, has the far larger list of credits), but the plot had many weak moments, and many predictable ones (such as the mother waiting all night for the boy to come home) and some unrealistic ones (that the father would be either oblivious, uncaring or unconcerned about his son's dress, demeanor, or potential homosexual. This would not be a very realistic response for a father in a small Midwest town in 1984, particularly over an 17 year old son and the older son at that. While predictable that the Maggie character would not merely be the best friend of the gay lead but also be in love with him, this was played true to life for the most part and among the better parts of the movie. What would not be as plausible would be that she would be so in love and so enamored that she wouldn't question the boy's sexuality either, until she saw him actually kissing someone. Nor would it be realistic that they would have their tearful meeting in her bedroom well before the shock of the kiss in a gay bar, a tearful meeting during which he would confess to having fooled around with an older gay boy, and that she would be forgiving, then go ballistic over a fully clothed kiss on the dance floor where the two men were not even doing anything like grinding into one another.I would also agree that the movie has a good point in not wrapping up all the resolutions at the end does he go to New York, does the mother deal with his homosexuality or not, how does the father react, what happens with his childhood friend, Maggie, etc. However, contrary to what someone else note, the filmmakers did go for a feel good happy ending in the bar scene, more so underlined because they dragged an older, Ohio State boy (the Jonathan character) back to a bar on coincidentally the same night that Eric finally decided to reappear. It would have been sufficient to have the Lea Delaria dedication and the gay boy be happy, but the filmmakers obviously had to add the possibility of true love on top.As for the music, I do agree the soundtrack could have been so much better. This was no so much New Wave as it was Top 40 80s music with some GLARING omissions (Depeche Mode), Cars by Gary Numan, the Human League, ABC, Soft Cell's Tainted Love, and the most glaring omission of all was absolutely no Eurthymics music on the soundtrack, in his bedroom or the gay bar. If they couldn't get permission for their music or afford the rights, REWRITE THE DAMN screenplay and use a different tee!!!

However, that does not mean I do not understand the harsh reality of growing up and coming of age. It truly does not matter what year it is or what the subject matter is. In this film, the subject matter just happens to be a young man coming to terms with the fact he is homosexual.Big deal! All young men go through awkward and difficult times in their young adult life. So what! Puberty, sexuality, the size of their Johnson....All young men have at one point questioned themselves regarding their sexuality. I am not 100% gay, but that doesn't mean I don't understand what the lead character was going through.Unfortunately, the reality of this film is dead on. Most gay men are only after sex. Anyone reading this that denies that...read it again...I said MOST. Of the gay men I know and associate with, they will tell you the same thing. I felt this movie, as harsh and true to life as it was, did not, in my opinion, help foster any sense of pride for being gay or bisexual.This film, though full of reality and complex situations, does not deliver the goods, in my opinion. It only makes people look at gays, lesbians and bisexuals as freaks, drug addicts, partiers, etc. And in most cases, it is a sad true reality. "}]
