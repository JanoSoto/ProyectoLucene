One also typically expects a movie in which a husband directs his wife in a lead role to be fairly shallow or at least unbalanced.  I crossed this movie off my list pretty early, expecting a forgettable Griffith-overload creation and little more.Wrong!  It's well-acted, engrossing, funny, and uplifting without feeling schmaltzy or (despite its farfetched plot) artificial.  Every so often you want to rewind a bit, to hear some extra-cute bit of dialog again, or savor an especially well-done shot.  (The camera work and sets, both indoor and outdoor, show unusual care, flash, and detail; this didn't dawn on me for most of the first hour but a rewind made it obvious.) Overall, 9 stars out of ten.  ButI wouldn't urge anyone to see this movie for Melanie Griffith.  She does a fine job, but she's not what puts it over the top.  As with quite a few recent films, I found that the performances of the extremely well-chosen supporting actors were a big part of what held the film together and made it so much more than it might have been.  Most notable here is Rod Steiger as the judge, who captivates utterly; John Beasley as Nehemiah -- though his character could have stood a lot more development; and the perpetually underrated Meat Loaf as the slimy sheriff. Performances like Steiger's make you want to ransack the video store to rent all his older films.Finally, I believe Lucas Black is destined for greatness.  I couldn't watch him without remembering River Phoenix as Chris in Stand By Me.Why this film doesn't even rate a Maltin summary is beyond me.

It's the 1960s in Alabama and Lucille (Melanie Griffith) murders and decapitates her abusive husband Chester, and heads to Hollywood with his head. Meanwhile back home, segregation is being fought in her small town. Our narrator is Lucille's nephew, he is living with his uncle (David Morse), witnessing the evil of the town sheriff (Meat Loaf) and trying to make sense of the civil rights movement.This is an odd, yet ultimately successful, merging of two very different stories. The Alabama civil rights story is a gentle, human drama, while the Lucille story is broadly colored, with flashy costumes, comical characters, and tart dialogue. Lucille dazzles everyone who meets her, and everything goes her way, despite the fact that Chester's head continues to speak to her, calling her a slut who'll never amount to anything. I can't explain why the surreal comedy works so well in parallel to the small town drama, but it does. Griffith is compelling -- her husband, Antonio Banderas, directs her as he sees her, the camera keeps finding the perfect woman; thrilling, sensual and sweet.In the featurette on the DVD, both Griffith and Banderas say the movie is about freedom, and the stories parallel well because Lucille's freedom from her husband's oppression parallels the blacks' freedom from civil oppression. But I saw it more as an R.D. Laing movie. The truth of Crazy in Alabama is in its title -- sanity IS a sane answer to an insane world. The nation WAS watching Bewitched and shopping for hats while blacks were beaten to death for the right to use whites-only facilities. Crazy, in this movie, defies definition -- what is individual craziness when the world goes crazy? Lucille's craziness is sweet and understandable; the world's, less so. 9/10 "},{"Title":"This movie still works so well for me!","Date":"14 March 2008","Score":"9 out of 11 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Drama","Review":" I am in the process of trying to clean out an oversupply of VHS tapes and some of them are so easy to toss. Not this one. I had to sit down and watch it again and now I could only get rid of the VHS if I had it on DVD! I have not watched this movie in more than six years and it was feel good and feel all over again. David Morse is always wonderful. Lucas Black, Cathy Moriarty, Meat Loaf, Elizabeth Perkins, and many others are just a treat to watch. There's something about Melanie. I can't help liking her - even when I am finding fault with her. This movie really is strange with its incredibly serious (and gruesome) subject matter of a woman who methodically murders and decapitates her husband and then carries his head around with her - first in Tupperware and then in a very stylish hat box! The surprising part is that there is any plausibility at all, but it somehow existed for me. It had a strange feeling floating about it that was akin to Forrest Gump or Nurse Betty, because it involved situations that were truly horrible, but everything kept working out for a sweet and naive character. The civil rights story was a very poignant counterpoint to the fantastic silliness of Lucille's odyssey. If I were a film student I may have sat there and criticized the way things came together, but I just watched it with an untrained eye, so it was fine. I certainly would have made the connection about a freedom theme even if they hadn't come out and stated it in the end. No one says a story has to be believable or plausible for it to work. This did work. I laughed a lot when I least expected to.

Lucille was a woman abused by her husband for many years and finally had enough. In one foul swoop she killed her husband and ran for Hollywood talking his head with her on her new found freedom. Griffith as the free spirited Lucille is fantastic. Other actresses could have made this character a lot more sinister or evil but Griffith made her some one that you could relate to. The other story line is that of Lucille's nephew P. Joe, whom she left behind in Alabama. He is dealing with the aftermath of Lucille's departure from Alabama and all of the racism and hatred that is in his town. Meatloaf is great as the racist police chief that has a personal vendetta against Lucille, P. Joe and his family. This movie is very touching and I believe that Banderas did a good job at directing. I home that he continues he will do more projects in the future that have this kind of caliber. I recommend that you watch this movie because it is great for viewing at home.

After seeing it, I wondered why I had not heard more of it. The trailers did not give away anything about this wonderfully written script. Antonio Banderas did a great job in direction, but Lucas Black stole the show with his acting. After thinking he was masterful in Sling Blade, it was great seeing him get another role to show off his talents. Steiger was perfect for the role, although anyone could have played the Robert Wagner role. However, seeing such big stars playing cameos, should tell you that the script was a great read. I don't want to give you any insight into the story line, because it is so well interwoven that it has to be seen to understand. It gets nicely tied up in the end from a small statement from Lucas Black. Melody Griffith has not always been a favorite of mine, mostly because she does always pick roles that she fits, but in this one, I cannot imagine anyone else fitting the role. She did an excellent job. I say that, because there were parts where I forgot it was her, and got caught up in the actual character she was playing.This is one that is definitely worth a look. The overtones of the era are played nicely and figure greatly in the story line. Why it was overlooked when the big awards came out, I have no idea. This one should have won something.

Overall, the film was very faithful to the novel.  The acting was excellent but I did have reservations.While Melanie Griffith would normally have been perfect for wacky Aunt Lucille, she was NOT 34 years old as the radio announcer said on the getaway car radio.  If they acknowledged this fact, and actually STATED somehow that Lucille was 40 years old, no spring chicken, or whatever, the credibility gap would not have been so wide.Additionally, in the book it was very clear that Lucille named her 7 children after movie stars Rock for Rock Hudson, Sandra for Sandra Dee, etc.  It was virtually lost in the movie.  And why were the kids almost ALL the same age (7 or 8).  One or two should have been 12 or 13, given Ms. Griffith's age.And I was totally put off by the fact that Lucille got her BIG BREAK by just sending in her head shot to the producers of Bewitched, and they went on and on about how wonderful she looked.  Eh????????????  Studios get thousands of head shots from Hollywood hopefuls, and frankly her photos were pretty pathetic.  In the book, a vacationing talent scout saw Lucille in a community theatre production of The Sound of Music and saw some Star Quality in her and invited her to come look him up if she ever got to Hollywood.  Now THAT would've made a lot more sense and it would have been far more BELIEVABLE!!!!!!!Other than those points, I found everyone's acting wonderful, and Banderas did a fine job of directing.  And why were some of the critics so CONFUSED by the switching back and forth of the two stories?  Duh!!! Didn't these people go to high school or college?

Ms. Griffith should be at the very center of a firestorm of debate on what's wrong with Hollywood, and the principal lesson we can learn from movies like this one is that Hollywood is lazy. Melanie Griffith is not only not a very good actress, she is so abominably bad and mind-numbingly predictable in her infantile reactions and sex-kitten phrasings that she should never have been seen aside from her appearances in Body Double and Something Wild, in which the characters she played were simply tailored to fit her deficient persona. For anyone who still disagrees, let me put it this way. If you were to remove the mannerisms, vocalizations, and elements of style that Ms. Griffith has simply lifted from Judy Holliday and Marilyn Monroe, you would not have enough actor left to fill the shoes of a crowd-scene extra. Yet the Hollywood system somehow works to keep this Cleopatra's barge afloat, long after it should have run aground. But, since she's who she is, however unfortunate that may be for all of us, we'll go on seeing her again and again, silicon-blown lips and breasts and, oh, what's the use? This movie is really parts of two movies that never really come together, and that wouldn't really be able to stand up by themselves either. We have a typical Hollywood construct, 60's racist Alabama, intercut with a retail clerk's dream of ascendance to stardom kill your abusive husband, steal a car, by a hat for the hatbox, (paste classical reference here) sweet-talk a cop out of holding you in jail--Banderas probably knows so little about police procedure in this country that he actually thought the hatbox in a stolen vehicle would not be checked-- win big in Las Vegas, audition for Bewitched, and become a star. Maybe we're supposed to remember here that Liz Montgomery also played Lizzie Borden in a TV movie several years after Bewitched tanked and she was renovating her image as a Now woman. Regardless, the classification of this film as comedy-drama should have been the tip-off that whenever Ms Griffith found herself in trouble, the baby-doll would pop out, coo sickeningly, and her character would survive for yet another stunning costume change. Now, the serious side of this movie flounders like the fully dressed blacks diving into the pool--we're supposed to think here of baptism, even before we see the image of the little boy floating in the crucifixion pose--and we are also supposed to swallow yet another screenwriter's slam-dunk of a terribly complex and many-sided situation, that of racial injustices of sixties Alabama. I remember sitting in an editing room, telling my working partner I'd just come back from Alabama, where my father is buried. F--- Alabama! she said. She was from New York, and movies like this were her entire experience of the south. So, here we are, in the middle of this dreadful hash a dream of becoming a star, which, oddly enough, is played by an actor who has expressed in interviews this same desire, over and over again to be a star, even tho she is incapable of acting. Then we have the Hollywood construct of a mythical, deeply stereotyped world racist South, lustful cop, get-rich Las Vegas, and star-studded Hollywood. And to top it all off, we have A. Banderas, who, come to think of it, may actually be the closest thing to a male counterpart to Melanie Griffith you're liable to find. He's fulfilling his dream of coming to America, becoming a star in something other than Almodovar films (the worst of which was much better than this) and finally, directing. Every boy's Hollywood dream. Like Griffith, he seems to think that talent or ability should have nothing to do with it. And if this movie had been anything like the hit it was billed as in the trailers, He would have been right. But, somehow, over and over again, that self-referencing Hollywood myth simply breaks down, over and over again. What we have, then, is shoddy stars that no one really wants to see, like Melanie Griffith, shoddy directing, that we could live without, like Banderas,' and shoddy films, that no one really wanted to see, playing three times a day on Bravo, like this one. Do yourself a favor, the next time this one's on Change the channel.

Chester was killin' me the slow way for thirteen years. Obviously Lucille preferred the fast way when it came to putting an end to her spouse.	The next story revolves around a civil right movement in Alabama. A young black teenager, Taylor Jackson (Louis Miller) is killed by a local prejudice sheriff named John Doggett (Meat Loaf Aday), who angrily pulls the innocent victim off a fence after he and his friends protest against the prohibition of swimming in the city pool. The late boy's parents attempt to lead a civil right crusade while trying to build a case to make Doggett pay for his crime.	Through another story is where these stories are linked. We see these events through the point of view of a young man's realization of life in the South without parents. This character, named Peejoe (Lucas Black), is the nephew of Lucille. She trustingly reveals all her secrets to Peejoe before she heads for Hollywood. He is also the only witness the violent act of Sheriff Doggett, placing him in the middle of the civil rights movement. Peejoe is not the center of the movie, however, and his character is completely unneeded and only adds additional complexity to the screenplay.  He is simply an excuse to interlock the other two plots, and the attempt does not work. 	The stories by themselves are very interesting, with inventive and original ideas and some thought-provoking messages. The film feels convincing in its development of the setting and atmosphere; the 1960's are captured with intrigue. Although it is his first feature film, Antonio Banderas, also a well-known actor starring 1999's Viking drama The 13th Warrior, he should have realized the complexity of the plot as a negative contribution. There are movies in which multiple stories make the production unique and innovative, like Traffic, Magnolia, and Pulp Fiction, but those movies blended their narratives together carefully, Crazy in Alabama only makes excuses for its actions.

A racist cop kills an African American boy when protests erupt at a swimming pool. He was overseen by a white boy who lives with his aunt and uncle. They themselves are concerned for their fugitive sister who poisoned her abusive husband and placed his decapitated head in a hat box. It doesn't help matters that she hears his voice and answers. Antonio Banderas brings a fine directing style to the material but it is nearly sabotaged by Melanie Griffith's constant overacting. The fact that a judge can have sympathy on her because she is female is repulsive. Supporting players include David Morse as her brother in what amounts to a one note role. Lucas Black as her nephew is set to testify against Meatloaf as the racist cop. Black spends much of the film plotting against him before arriving at a conclusion that directly lifts from the superior masterpiece On the Waterfront. Cathy Moriarty plays Griffith's sister, and likely wondering whether she was adopted and never knowing the truth. Even Meatloaf who pulls off a decent performance is succumbed to predictable writing. Scenes placed as humorous are hardly that and the subplots create unfocused themes that can drive one crazy.

If you haven't seen the film, you might want to wait until you have seen it before you read this comment.This is a very likeable film about a flaky woman and her family in 60's Alabama.  Lucille (Melanie Griffith) is fleeing her small town because she just killed her husband and cut off his head.  She left the body in her freezer and decided to take the head with her as she embarks on her new career in Hollywood.  This is actually two stories.  The first is Lucille's escapades and the second follows her young nephew Peejoe back home, who finds himself in the middle of a civil rights incident involving the death of a young black man who refuses to leave an all white swimming pool.  Both stories are well done, but disparate.  This is my first criticism of the Mark Childress screenplay based on his own novel.  This story can't make up its mind whether it is a farce (the Lucille story) or a serious drama about civil rights in the 1960's.  It succeeds in both regards, but putting the two together takes impact and credibility away from the serious civil rights story, which in my mind was the better element.  My second criticism was the ending.  Lucille is tried and convicted of the first degree murder of her husband and is sentenced to 20 years, (suspended) and five years of therapy, then set free.  Although this panders shamelessly to the feel good audience, and Lucille was a lovable character, films like this send the wrong message to the masses regarding justice and accountability.  The message is that if you are likeable, flaky and a victim, the rule of law doesn't have to apply to you.  I feel that the film industry needs to take a little more responsibility than this.When I rented the movie, I started out skeptical about the prospects of a film directed by Antonio Banderas, even more since his wife Melanie Griffith was cast in the lead.  I was pleasantly surprised on both counts.  Banderas showed very solid direction, good camera work, excellent period props (great vintage cars), and an attention to detail that was impressive for a first time director.Melanie Griffith was the best I can remember her since `Working Girl'.  She was charmingly loopy and brightened up every scene she was in.  But as good as she was, the best performance was from young Lucas Black as Peejoe.  After a fine performance in `Sling Blade' he proves it wasn't just a fluke.  Black has a natural, plain spoken acting style with that heavy southern drawl which is I'm sure must be close to his real accent.  He projects sincerity and character and an inner strength far greater than one would expect for his years.  I look forward to seeing more of his work.I rated this film 7/10.  It was a good story with an identity crisis, but most people will have an easy time liking this film.

While it's not unusual to see actors become directors, I underwent a huge frameshift in seeing Banderas making his huge directorial debut in Crazy in Alabama. As you might have not known, Antonio Banderas has been acting for quite some time (since 1983) in various movies that even surprised me. Secondly, Banderas was also a producer in four flicks. We can assume then, that Antonio has the bare-bones of what it takes to be a director. The biggest hurdle Banderas will have to bound is that of a recycled concept. Crazy in Alabama is an adaptation from a novel that will either refresh the 'operate-out-side-of-standard-society-and-reinvent-the-way-you- see-things' or beat the proverbial horse once more. This can either make him or break him. He has his work cut out for him. Like most things, all we have is expectations. I'm expecting Banderas to prove to everyone that he can do more than just act (we know he can dance, and wield a mean guitar). So he can either earn the respect of his peers and fans everywhere, or he can fall flat on his -ss. You can quote me on that.Melanie Griffith, as it happens is also in the movie, starring as Lucille.

Melanie's real-life hubby, Antonio Banderas, directed, and this is where it falls down. It simply isn't certain what it wants to be. Dark comedies walk a fine line, and often fail, ending up just awkwardly dark and equally funny instead of a no-doubt desired hip result. Perhaps it's a question of percentages, or timing. I don't know. Crazy in Alabama is about a woman (Griffith) in 1965 who kills her husband, and takes off. The family supports her, the law is after her, and she's following her own (and others) voice, almost without guilt. Just when you're convinced she IS crazy, the script asks her to be a rational woman delivering lucid speeches (a courtroom wrap up), etc. The story jumps in and out of locations, often with sub-plots (I have no problem with that), the sets are good, the clean car syndrome is everywhere, Griffith does Griffith in period clothing, David Morse often seems like a deer caught in headlights, Meat Loaf Aday is perfectly sleazy, and Rod Steiger at the Judge is hilarious.

In fact, this movie seems very similar to the latter. This film was made first, so if anything, `Nurse Betty' stole some elements to make a vaguely similar movie. Both films follow a squeaky voiced, possibly insane woman across America, whilst being on the run. They both pursue travelling to Los Angeles, and have dead husbands (for different reasons). Hmm&#133; never mind. `Crazy in Alabama' is a sometimes surreal but more often compelling movie set against two different backgrounds. The first is social activism and the fight against apartheid in the Deep South during the 1960's. Meanwhile, the second is a background of glitz, glamour and superficial style in Hollywood, California. These two very different styles don't gel together and as the stories criss-cross one another, the sudden shift in tone from grim, powerful drama to darkly black comedy is unsettling to say the least. But it lifts the film out of the norm, to make it seem a bit more interesting.Banderas' directorial flare really shows in the most original credits sequence ever. As the names are shown on the screen, an image is placed beside it, describing that character's job/role. The soundtrack is filled with nostalgic, outdated music, such as `These Boots are made for Walking', that perfectly fits in with the two tones of the film. The script is sharp and unpredictable but the cinematography is disappointing. The sets on Hollywood are convincing, but in Alabama, the sets are too claustrophobic and enclosed. Average - very good performances from the big cast of familiar faces. It's not surprising that Oscar nominee Melanie Griffith landed the lead role, after all, she is the director's wife. Nonetheless, she excels equally as the ditz, and the woman to be taken seriously. Lucas Black is good as the young white kid, but the accent drawls a bit and isn't all that convincing. David Morse and Cathy Moriarty work well with the material they've been given, not that there's much there. Plenty of good support from a nice supporting cast including Rod Steiger, Meat Loaf and Noah Emmerich. The vest characters go to Robert Wagner and Elizabeth Perkins as the respective Hollywood agent and jealous movie star.It's just too bad that they didn't get the screen time their characters deserved. The film starts when we hear that Lucille (Griffith) murdered her husband. It would have been better had we received a proper introduction, or at least an image of this character. In the last 15 minutes, the two stories intertwine into a courtroom drama. Despite being a little out of tone, this leaves a satisfying taste in the mouth and ends the movie on a good note.While not quite as good as I thought it would be, `Crazy in Alabama' is a wry, oddball comedy/drama that has originality and entertainment in spades. After all, I guess my expectations were astronomical. My IMDb rating 6.5/10.

Leaving her children in the care of relatives, Lucille steals a Cadillac to head west for Hollywood and auditions for a spot in a TV show, and (surprise) wins over the auditioners to land a spot.  Along the way she has to sweet-talk a cop out of booking her, win a chunk of change at roulette in Vegas, and net a slick agent (played by Robert Wagner) to guide her in her ascent-- all of which falls into place without a hitch.  Oh, and she's also tortured by the taunting and cynical remarks of her husband's talking head, which she's still carrying in one of those ever-so-useful Tupperware containers.Up to this point, the movie's fun as a kind of ludicrously madcap on-the-road romp under totally unbelievable circumstances.  Lucille has a tawdry charm to which the people around her are receptive beyond all credibility.  The cops are reliably incompetent, the roulette wheel lands just where it needs to land, and the Hollywoodites are smitten with the hillbilly ingenue beyond any sensibility.  In a nutshell, all of Lucille's capers are hilariously and wildly implausible and the film knows they are-- it should have stayed this course and continued without taking itself too seriously.  But then it clumsily tries to become a message film with a weighty parable about freedom and civil rights, and it draws a parallel between Lucille's cartoonish road trip and the deadly-earnest battle for African-American civil rights which is both ridiculous and patently offensive.Back in Alabama, a stereotypically repulsive and bigoted sheriff (Meat Loaf Aday) beats several black youth who are trying to enter a whites-only pool, accidentally killing one of them.  PeeJoe is shocked by the incident and becomes a sort of civil rights icon, even meeting Martin Luther King himself.  As is often seen, the tangled complexities of the Deep South at the time are reduced to politically-correct caricatures, and an (albeit enlightened) white character, Pee Joe in this case, earns the praise and spotlight for his civil rights efforts instead of the African-Americans who themselves had to carry out the fight in the trenches.  But the pool incident and its aftermath are filmed well enough in their own right. It's when the movie tries to link the liberation of a people from oppression to Lucille's zany misadventures that the movie falls apart disastrously. Aunt Lucille's emancipation, in both Mark Childress's book and the movie, is obviously a kind of Jerry Spinger-ish trailer park fantasy.  The struggles of the black youth in Alabama are an altogether different, deadly serious and very real battle.  One reviewer stated that Crazy in Alabama is heartwarming because it promises that good will triumph over evil, even if it takes a while-- and it's this naive and simplistic black-and-white view of things that is the movie's downfall.  This film is simply not the setting for social commentary, especially the kind that faces up to all the painful contradictions and shades of gray that rule conflicts in the real world. A movie doesn't necessarily have to do this, but Crazy's problem is that it pretends to.minor spoilers ahead, for Crazy in Alabama, Mulholland Drive, and The Producers The feeble link between Lucille's misadventures and the goings-on in Alabama is supposedly established at Lucille's trial, after her husband's head is inconveniently discovered.  She makes a Capraesque appeal to freedom and claims a kinship with the Alabama civil rights struggles.  The jury convicts her, but the mush-headed judge is of course taken with her oratory, and issues her a suspended sentence, justifying the connection.In many respects this film is well-done.  The cinematography is fabulous, the sights and sounds of Lucille's road trip nicely portrayed, and there's a stirring intensity to the civil rights struggles, not unlike those in Mississippi Burning.  The acting is by-and-large of high quality.  Melanie Griffith acquits herself well with the material she has, and Banderas's direction has a professional touch even though this is his first effort. Indeed, the two stories themselves are actually quite entertaining.  But sadly, the film tries to weave them together as interlocking and parallel tales, and it just doesn't work.  The civil rights story is a serious matter involving the struggle of a long downtrodden people, and it's played straight.  It's practically insulted by a parallel to the intentionally goofy and implausible escapades of Lucille.Lucille's story itself would be fine as a stand-alone film.  Her scenes are funny, and they're meant to be a kind of Southern-fried, grits-n-burnt-toast version of 1960's Hollywood daydreaming.  Lucille's experiences on the road trip are clearly a kind of fantasy world for her, and Banderas does a good job of making the scenes implausibly surreal but  endearing at the same time.  Lucille's story has some similarities with Mulholland Drive, with an upset and burnt-out central character fantasizing about Hollywood success without having to pay the dues.  The film would have done better to move along these lines, or to turn it into a quirky send-up of The Producers, with a less heavy-handed courtroom speech by Lucille and a concluding scene with her hamming it up in a prison play.  Mark Childress's novel and screenplay aren't spectacular (especially compared to his excellent Tender), but in any case something goes terribly wrong with the move to film.  The two storylines just don't mix, and by trying to force-feed a social message in a film that's more of a screwball comedy, the movie fails on too many levels.

The film tries to be some sort of cross between Thelma & Louise and To Kill a Mockingbird, but it doesn't explore its issues with nearly as much intelligence as its predecessors; it also suffers from poor direction, bad editing, and a terribly weak script. The story follows a southern belle named Lucille (played by Banderas's real-life spouse, Melanie Griffith) who kills her husband and keeps his severed head in a hatbox as she takes off on a road trip to make her dreams of stardom come true. Meanwhile, her nephew Peter Joseph (nick-named Peejoe and played by Sling Blade's Lucas Black), stays in Alabama with her brother and becomes involved in a civil rights struggle. The film makes an interesting connection between a repressed woman's desire for a life outside of her family and African-Americans' battle for freedom and equality, but Banderas is too obsessed with the issues themselves to ever reasonably explore them. Instead of an intelligent dissection of what freedom means and how far one should go to achieve it, we're served a one-sided statement that attempts to win over our sympathy by mere opinionation. Sorry, Antonio, but you're not going to trick THIS viewer that easily. But this is just one of a number of flaws that end up overshadowing any of the picture's positive qualities the screenplay itself is ripe with cliches and incoherencies. The plot and its progression are so absurd that the film borders the line between drama and slapstick, and by never deciding which side it's on, the entire movie ends up looking like the latter. My BIGGEST beef with the film is just why -- exactly -- Lucille bothers to lug her husband's head around with her it's too far-fetched to say that she was simply fed up with him, and it's too easy to call her crazy. Also, the inclusion of several scenes in which the head actually TALKS to her is utterly ridiculous. Perhaps the film was doomed from the start, in which the opening credits sequence is animated Pink Panther-style with These Boots are Made for Walkin' playing in the background (not to mention the unnecessary voice-over that appears unevenly throughout). The acting is mixed while Griffith makes the most of her poorly-written part, young Lucas Black is obviously typecast after his near-identical role in Sling Blade. Meat Loaf is good as the stereotypically corrupt cop, and the supporting cast includes the likes of Cathy Moriarty, David Morse, and Robert Wagner. But the high point of the film (performance-wise) is for sure Rod Steiger's cameo as a judge. As for the direction, Banderas should stick to acting. If I were to grade Crazy in Alabama based solely on effort and intention, I would give it an A; but considering the end result, I'm afraid I'm going to have to a little more harsh.Grade D+ "},{"Title":"It's about living with, and responding to, violence.","Date":"18 February 2003","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Drama","Review":"  Crazy in Alabama pits violence against our attempts to understand, live with, and stop it. * A woman, abused by her husband, responds by killing him and decapitating him so she can hold him prisoner and prove her worth to him.* A community, abused by those in power, responds with civil disobedience.* A boy, horrified by the violence, prejudice, and hypocrisy of his role models, calls on the law and the media to bring about justice.And yet... it's funny!

Also, two of their children were in the movie AND Melanie's acting coach. Also, the writer of Fried Green Tomatoes was the coffee shop waitress. All these little tidbits helped me to understand how much love and detail went into the movie. Also, Antonio was interested in doing the movie because it showed what was happening in the 60's which the riots about integration.

With surround sound, it was particularly effective. All of sudden, you hear a voice come out of one of your rear speakers and it's this head coming from inside a box! It's funny, believe me. So were other parts but then the film turns into another typical preaching about racism in the South and then gives - courtesy of Fannie Flagg playing a waitress - an anti-religious cheap shot or two. Religious people are usually referred to in film as fanatics, as Flagg says here. People who espouse Left Wing causes, from the environment to abortion to PETA, are never called fanatics. I wonder why that is? Too bad the bias had to enter because it was a fun film to that point with Melanie Griffith, Lucas Black and David Morse all doing a fine job.

But I watched it for entertainment, and it held my interest all the way. Some have carped about the overly complex plot, but I thought the complexity was nicely handled and effectively completed. It added a touch of reality to a film that certainly needed it in order to stay grounded. And the violence in that side of it was pretty discreetly handled, compared to other such I've seen.Melanie Griffith came through rather nicely, I thought. It was a tough part demanding a rare combination of innocence and awareness, and I think she was perfect for it. The kids, too, were absolutely great!My favorite line in it was when Peejoe says to his brother What's a diaphragm? And his brother, after a moment, shrugs and says I dunno.

Dramatic sub plot keeps this satire on a roll. An abused Alabama housewife and mother of seven brakes free of her controlled situation by severing her husbands head with an electric carving knife. She ends up traveling with his head in a hat box, as she motors her way to California to become an actress.Meanwhile back home, her favorite nephew(Lucas Black)has become a nationwide hero from being caught up in social and racial unrest. The sheriff, played by singer Meat Loaf, is the towns supreme bigot and also proves to be a blackmailer.Although a wee bit on the absurd side, this comedic drama is touching and redeeming. A few familiar faces that add texture to this fast moving flick are Rod Steiger, Robert Wagner and Fanny Flagg.

It was hilarious, thats why I gave ten stars.A woman carrying her dead husbands head to Hollywood was as unique as the parting of the Red Sea, and even more bizarre, was the fact that she actually landed a spot on a major television show.All this was happening, while poor old mom was taking care of her kids, who for some reason seemed to all be all the same age. Her female anatomy must have been built a lot like an M-60 to squirt them out at that rate. Poor Pejoe had a hell of a time with the crazy sheriff, because he saw him kill a black kid. It was chaos from beginning to end. and I would recommend it to anyone who is into utter craziness. I actually thought it was fabulous.

Melanie Griffith plays a battered wife who snaps and decapatates her abusive husband and heads to Hollywood to become a movie star with his head in a hotbox.  The film's only redeeming quality was the character Peejoe (Lucas Black), who was the hero in the film, and the film's focus on the Civil Rights Movement.  And Meat Loaf's role as the evil sherriff who kills a black teen for swimming in the pool was downright abysmal.  Everytime he opened his mouth, you'd expect him to sing Paradise By the Light, or Two out of Three Ain't Bad.    This was Antonio Bandaras's directorial debut.  If you're a fan of Antonio or Melanie Griffith see some of their other movies.  Skip this one.  It's just your typical vitcimized woman movie, nothing special about it.  Not worth the time.

This movie is not about social commentary. This movie is ridiculous and absurd,and oh so funny. Melanie Griffith is delightful as the kooky aunt who seems to be teetering on the edge. Yeah, yeah, she brutally murdered and decapitated her abusive husband. So what? He had it coming. Aside from this little mistake, you just can't help loving her. She is kind and caring, and sweet as sugar. See the movie for what it is, a far-fetched farce, and you will split a gut laughing. If you're looking for social commentary try Schindler's List.

What the plotters had in mind with this overbaked concoction is truly beyond the powers of mere mortal understanding.The Mark Childress screenplay is a textbook case study of narrative schizophrenia run amok.  Melanie Griffith, obviously past her darling ingenue stage and heading into the career sunset of doddering, crazy aunt roles, plays the stereotypical Southern lunatic who has decapitated her abusive husband, packed his head in a tupperware container she carries with her in a hatbox and headed off (pardon the pun) to find fame and glory in the spotlight of 1960's Hollywood.  Almost tangetially, the film also concerns itself with her nephew, Peejoe, and his experiences that summer involving a clash between blacks and whites over a segregated swimming pool in the small southern town in which he lives.To say that the filmmakers fail to coalesce these elements into a coherent whole would be a masterpiece of understatement.  This actually seems to be two completely different films rubbing up against one another and not liking each other very much.  The audience, as a result, is left in a state of headscratching and, occasionally, even jawdropping confusion.Unfortunately, the film fails to work as either a freewheeling black comedy or as an incisive social document.  As in so many films dealing with the issue of civil rights, the blacks play secondary roles in their own story, standing in the background as part of a mob rather than stepping forth as fully developed, fully rounded characters in their own right.It also seems odd that a film which approaches this issue in such highminded and reverential terms tries, at the same time, to pass off a serious mental illness as a quaintly admirable example of freespirited non-conformity.  The film suffers from a terminal grinding of tonal gears.  Who could ever imagine that the same film would feature a recreation of an appearance by Martin Luther King Jr. and the filming of a Bewitched episode - and believe that such a coupling could ever result in a meaningful marriage?  It is a testament to the utter absurdity and hopelessness of the entire enterprise.Drawing a parallel between a woman who cuts her husband's head off and a group of black people fighting for equal rights and uncritically calling both examples of freedom equal to one another insults those involved in the noble latter cause. And not all the scenes of phony emotional uplift at the end - a scanning of tear soaked faces at a ludicrous trial, a shot of Griffith, standing through a sun-roof riding off into the sunset, arms raised in a victory salute - can mitigate the tastelessness at the film's core.Crazy in Alabama simply proves that, for an offbeat film to be successful, an attempt has to be made to blend the disparate elements of plotting and tone into an organic whole.  As it is, Crazy in Alabama is merely weird without being any fun.

So why didn't the movie work?  Perhaps Melanie Griffith should avoid dark hair; it makes her look sick and old and malnourished.  Perhaps subtleties of expression or movement are lost on a director who's not from around here and doesn't appreciate here anyway. At any rate, the book was a buoyant look at absurdity arising from tragedy and an affirmation that good will triumph over evil, eventually, although perhaps not in the way we'd have expected.  The film falls flat.I was amazed that IMDB voters gave this film a higher rating than Crimes of the Heart, which had a similar plot (Babe Botrell shoots and hospitalizes philandering husband, uses the he needed killing defense; her entire family's reaction makes up the action).  Crimes of the Heart was hilariously funny; Crazy in Alabama might have been but wasn't.

Somewhat dark, since it has a long mistreated wife killing her husband, cutting off his head, and carrying it with her in a tupperware container. That's not a spoiler, we learn that immediately, and the whole movie is built around what happens after that. With her husband out of the way, crazy yet realizing she is now in trouble, she sets off to try to get to Hollywood where she is certain she can make it as an actress, the thing she always wanted to do but couldn't since her husband kept her barefoot and pregnant.  There is also the equally dark story of black unrest in this 1964 Alabama community and a demonstration at a public swimming pool leaves one dead.SPOILERS follow, for my own recollection, please read no further. Meatloaf does a fine job as the biggoted sheriff, and during the pool incident pulls a young black boy off a fence, causing him to fall to his death. Griffith's character actually does get a break in a TV series, is so good she is written in, her family back home find out when they see her in the TV show. In a gripping scene she walks onto the Golden Gate bridge to throw off her husband's head which she had carried everywhere in a hat box she got in New Orleans, right before she stole a bartender's car after he insulted her by calling her a whore, but back on the bridge her sack of Las Vegas winnings fly over the rail, gets caught below, she has to climb the guard rail to get it, a cop sees her thinking she was going to kill herself, they find the money and the head, she goes to trail in Alabama, a sympathetic judge gives her probation. The bad sheriff is exposed, we presume he will be tried eventually. "}]
