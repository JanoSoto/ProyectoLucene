Lawrence is teamed with Luke Wilson as they take on the bad guys using humor. From the very beginning, I knew that Blue Streak would be funny and interesting. The only requirement was to sit back and relax so the movie can carry me through. The story was quite unique having a thief pretend to be a police detective determined to collect a jewel left behind from a previous heist. To make the plot better and more interesting the writers make Lawrence's character in charge of the burglary division. Wilson didn't really add to the story and seemed to fill a role of sidekick. It was a pleasure to see William Forsythe in a role that did not have playing a villain. Overall, Blue Streak worked for me.

The film has no major flaw in it. There are no structural problems, dialogue issues, disruptive subplots, characterization uncertainty or tedious nuggets found in it. The filmmakers take advantage of Lawrence being in the movie, and have lots of fun with both him and the plot--things that make this comedy worthy of a minimal recommendation. The film opens with four jewel thieves, Miles Logan, Deacon, Eddie, and Tulley, constructing a heist in the middle of a dark, cold night attempting to steal a large diamond worth millions. Miles and Eddie sneak in the building, that beholds the valuable rock, from the roof using a steady rope to lure them down through the elevator shaft to their destination a security safe, located a few floors down. Deacon stays above assuring Eddie and Miles' safely, while Tulley stands watch below in the getaway car.Then, something goes wrong. While the team of bandits do indeed succeed in breaking through the buildings security and swindle the diamond, when Miles and Eddie reach Deacon on the roof, however,  he states that he is too greedy to spilt the value of the gem four ways, thus killing Eddie, and attempting to finish off Miles, who is holding on to the jewel, but before Deacon has the chance, the police arrive, and off goes Tulley in the getaway car, leaving Deacon and Miles no way to escape except to flee to a construction site nearby. There, Deacon manages to avoid being arrested by the cops, but never gets his hand on the gem. However, Miles keenly hides the jewel in the duct of this developing building, and makes note of where he hides it. As he arrested by the police, he vows to return for the secret treasure after his prison sentence is up--whenever that may be.Two years pass. Miles is happy to once again be a free citizen. He returns to his girlfriend, who, after never visiting him once in the two years he spent in jail, dumps him without a second thought. Miles is not too depressed, however, for he still has seventeen million dollars waiting for his arrival at the old contraction site where he hid it. The problem that exact constriction site is now finished. It is a brand spanking new police headquarters! Miles tries desperately to enter the building, only to be rejected by security every time. That is, however, until one of his old buddies manufactures a false police identification for him, thus allowing him to break into the building, and search for his beauty.  This is when he becomes involved with a crime bust that leads the police chief to believe that Miles is a professional, experienced cop, who is then partnered up with novice detective Carlson (Luke Wilson) to solve a criminal case. From here on out, the film runs from high energy and action packed excitement to clumsy and funny stunts of Logan trying to undercover the dream he once had located in what is now his office building. Director Les Mayfield lets the film's  writers have a lot of fun with the plot. The setup is at shaky  and first a bit ridiculous, but then propels the entire story following it though the problems it faces; when the plot stumbles at times and forgets its purpose, the Logan character still has reason to continue on the 17 million dollar jewel. The filmmakers do rely a bit much on that concept, but for the most part, the film stays clear from too many troubles. Just a few days ago, I screened the horror thriller Stigmata, and ended up not recommending it due to the fact that the film's scenes did not fit together to create a story possible to follow. While Blue Streak does fit together evenly and is distributive, if the truth be know, I would choose to see something with a little more depth, like Stigmata, than something as shallow as Blue Streak. But I feel that the majority of an audience goes to the movies for entertainment, not for some deep, disturbing message--if you're that kind of a moviegoer, then Blue Streak is for you.Brought to you Columbia Pictures.

It's also good to see Luke Wilson in it &#150; even if he's got a role that is really beneath his talents, although Greene is good. Really it's Lawrence's show and he does well but if you hate him then you'll hate this no matter what.Overall if you want a silly no-brain comedy then this is worth a shot, but if Lawrence annoys you then don't even bother.

At this time when this came to town I went because of the pre-views and thought it couldn't be that bad, right? In actuality, it was a lot of fun!! Martin was a great character that played the their turned sueto cop. This was a pleasure for me to watch. There are so many different things to choose from that it makes the competition tough. I'm thinking to myself, wow, I'm checking out Martin in the middle of everything else, so this must be strong enough. I was right. His dilemma after robbery, stealing expensive diamonds and then getting chased by the fuzz, makes things a little more complicated than he could handle. So, presto-stash-O. The diamond is stowed away, in a building that is going up. Good idea and 'quick' thinking for him. Although he gets busted anyway for breaking into the jewelry store. He does two years in the pen. He gets set free. Now he is feeling fine! He goes back to check out his girl and she has gone from a size petite, to Esther Role. This does not sit well with her either when he lets her know about the obvious change in girth. The rock of Gibraltar diamond that he stole, in his hiding place is not quite what he remembers it to be. He is a con that is free, standing in front of the new police building, where his little stolen article is awaiting his return. Now, complications play out bigger. He has what looks like a torette's syndrome break-down in front of the building and some officers out on break, while cars pass by and on lookers see him, freaking. He has to come up with a plan to get this job done. And considering where this is all taking place, it had better be brilliant. I won't give away what happens next, but this is a slick well crafted comedy with the likes of Luke Wilson and William Forsythe who has been in a number of outstanding films, both comedy and action and dramatic roles. There is always a bunch of stuff going on and it is a lot of crazy-half planned out funky Martin on the loose fun. He can't speak Spanish very well either, but that really won't hurt him in the end by the way. This is a Martin Lawrence casted good piece of now classic entertainment, that I can say, Yes I recommend it. See it if you haven't. It isn't going to win an Oscar, but it will be worth the time to watch.

One of his partners is killed, another escapes, and the third betrays him. Released from prison two years later he discovers that the building he originally robbed is now a police station. Directed by Les Mayfield with routine storytelling and a standard action climax straight out of your everyday crime television episodes. This is no gem comedy but for Mayfield, it is a far cry from the pathetic Flubber. Lawrence employs every ounce of comic wit he can and rises above the routine material despite an ending that is questionable at best. Luke Wilson is cardboard as his partner. In a more limited role Dave Chappelle is funny as Lawrence's friend who is subjected to various techniques of interrogation. Peter Green plays the standard villain whose presence is to look mean and issue threats before being arrested. Well made film that has an idea but no real followup in terms of plot or story structure. As a result we are left with a flat comedy where luck is not riding with the screenwriter.

A few years later, Logan is released and goes straight to the building and is blown away to discover that it is now a police station. Following a few lame attempts to get to the 4th floor, Logan realizes he has no option but to impersonate a police officer in order to get into the building. Things get stickier when the manufactured credentials that were created for him lead to his being put in charge of a major drug trafficking sting operation. He also finds himself genuinely caring about his rookie partner (Luke Wilson), who has come to idealize him, making it even more difficult for Logan to keep his eye on the prize.This comedy consistently entertains primarily thanks to Lawrence's ability to keep Miles Logan likable, no matter what he does. Yes, it is a little unsettling to believe that it is this easy to impersonate a police officer and move through the ranks so quickly. It's hard to accept the fact that Logan doesn't slip up long before he does, but the viewer forgives and accepts because we like Miles and more important, his partner and his superior officers like him, so we want the charade to work and yes, we really want to see him get that diamond back.Luke Wilson is charming as Logan's partner and in a refreshing change of pace, William Forsythe is on the right side of the law as Logan's commanding officer. Dave Chappelle also provides a few chuckles as an old acquaintance of Logan's who threatens to blow his cover. There is a well-staged shoot-out and a finale that will have you on the edge of your seat.

Blue Streak is in a similar vein to Bad Boys, with Martin Lawrance as the big mouthed negro who seems to never have anything go right.Lawrance plays a crook who steals a very valuable diamond but is betrayed by one of his colleagues who decides that a quarter of the proceeds is not enough. While escaping, he hides the diamond in a construction site. Two years later, after being released from gaol, he returns to find that the building is a police station. So he disguises himself as a police officer to get into the building and to steal the diamond.Blue Streak is a comedy of errors. It is not that Lawrance is an idiot, but rather that he is a crook, and everybody around him treats him as if he were a well decorated cop. He also seems to be able to solve cases that most cops couldn't because they do not have the criminal background that he has.Blue Streak isn't something that has any deep, philosophical meaning, but it is a cute movie to watch and enjoy. It is not entirely original, as role-reversals have been a common form of comedy for ages. The role reversal may be a little different, but I am sure there are other movies were crooks become cops and vice versa. It is just that Martin Lawrance adds cool spark to it.

Sometimes he does good and has actually funny and well done lines like in Life, other times he is not funny and just annoying, like in Black Knight. Dave Chappelle was definitely the highlight of the film. He is hilarious in almost every one of his scenes, making me wish he was in it more. Peter Greene gave basically the exact same performance as he did in The Mask, Training Day, Pulp Fiction and I'm assuming a lot of his other roles. He plays a good bad guy but nothing special. Luke Wilson was OK at best, same with the rest of the cast. The film is only held together by the comedy. It's an action comedy but the action is pretty clichéd. Your average gunfights and same old car chases, with some funny stuff here in there. Acting is OK, directing OK, story is pretty dumb and so on. Nothing special. If you enjoy Martin Lawrence then you will enjoy this film. If you don't like him don't even attempt to watch it. I like the movie but I'll say it's nothing worth going out of your way to see. If it's on TV or something and you are in the mood to have some laughs then go for it.

Though I was not laughing like the first time, each time I enjoyed his acting as well as other costars. Its a mood-lifter for me always. He is having both slapstick and verbal comedy talents blended together. The story is a very simple one. A diamond thief hides his valuable diamond in the air-duct of a building under construction. He was caught and jailed. After few years he comes back to get his jewel back from its hideout and finds out that the building has become a Police Department office.

You have everything planed out to the finest detail and nothing could possibly go wrong. You have the nervous driver in the car waiting for the get away, you have the guy on the roof taking care of the security and you have the two guys down in the hole doing the dirty work. You think everything is going great, you crack a joke right before you crack the safe (horrible pun, yes) You send your second inside man back up top, when things start to go all wrong. Little did you know that that the guy on the roof is greedy and would prefer to have the full seventeen million to himself rather than split it four ways and only get his allotted four million and change. This is the set up of the hilarious comedy staring Martin Lawrence - Blue Streak. After some bad things happen, like the cops coming, and a member of the burglar team being killed, Martin Lawrence's character, Miles, stashes the diamond in a building that is under construction. After serving his term in jail the fun begins. As a horribly funny state of irony the building that the diamond was stashed in turned out to be a police station. This is where the real comedy begins. Miles poses as a new transfer detective from Wes Covina and is hailed as the greatest thing in the department. Thinking he will only be in there for a few hours a series of twists and turns makes him the undisputed lead detective after only a day. While continually hunting down the diamond through the air ducts, he gets wrapped up in drug plots and making friendships along the way &#150; all while working on the opposite end of the law. Making a literal run for the boarder, all gets resolved with the comedic timing of Martin Lawrence, and co-stars Dave Chappelle and even Luke Wilson.

It's pretty much entirely his movie. Wilson is just barely there at all, and the rest of the players are there to play off Lawrence(or maybe rather, for him to play off), or provide obstacles for him in his continued quest for the diamond. I'm not quite sure why exactly we should care about his character... he's not sympathetic, and his actions are all motivated by his desire to get his hands on the aforementioned former piece of coal. The action is somewhat limited, but OK. It may have gone more for comedy than excitement, well, that, or the director didn't know how to do proper action(and the end of the last bit to feature it came out of nowhere). The plot is decent, I guess. The acting varies. Chapelle... you wouldn't know he was funny, from this(he certainly was in Robin Hood Men in Tights). Greene, well, all you have to do to know the guy can play an unsavory character is watch either Pulp Fiction or The Mask. The music selection is, if nothing else, fitting. Some of the humor is gross-out comedy, and, while it could have been worse(which it probably would have been, had they not been trying for a PG-13... how they got it, I do not know, there was profanity enough), seemed... unnecessary.

The movie begins with him as the thief doing a pretty sophisticated jewel heist which is botched when a partner gets selfish but he's still able to hide the evidence in an empty building's heat duct. After being in jail for 2 years, he gets out and tries to go back to where the jewel lies, but it's now a Los Angeles Police Station. He has to do some pretty tricky things to disguise himself as a new detective to get in the building, but he's immediately put on the street beat -- so he has to play the game for awhile. He does a pretty good job of it, to the point of being promoted to lead detective, mainly because he understands the criminal because he was one. This is where a lot of the fun happens in the movie. Luke Wilson and Dave Chappelle are kind of just there for the ride in this movie. Martin Lawrence is the star and the one that keeps the movie and story going and he does a pretty good job of it. The ending is kind of drawn out and a little far-fetched but the movie's 1st hour or so gives you enough good times and chuckles to make the movie worth it. Lawrence was surprising to me as a lead -- he handled it well and I'm looking forward to seeing his other movies in the future.

Both in Bad Boys and Nothing to Lose he gave a good performance showing that he is a born comedy actor. Blue Streak isn't that funny though. Before watching it I knew that it was not going to be as hilarious as Nothing to Lose. I was right.The film provides some entertaining scenes but on the other hand there were plenty of jokes that weren't that funny because Martin Lawrence exaggerated while trying to be amusing (for instance in the pizza delivery scene). The action isn't that good either (there's a word for this mediocre).They did another mistake by leaving the whole film in the hands of Lawrence. In Nothing to Lose as well as in Bad Boys Lawrence had a partner to make fun of and to be made fun of by. Martin Lawrence and Will Smith/Tim Robbins made a good team but Blue Streak contains a certain monotony because there is no important person beside him. Dave Chappelle's role was far too small to contribute much to the film. Anyway he had to play a slightly retarded person and so he became pretty annoying too.This movie isn't bad but it isn't outstanding either. So if you don't have any other film to watch you might as well spend a few dollars on this one. The comedy is good for a few laughs and the action is okay (unless you're really hard to satisfy).

One scene in particular was when he showed up in disguise as a pizza delivery man at the precinct- this scene simply didn't make me laugh.

Having said that, he also requires the right material, and a sufficiently straight straight man to bounce his comic genius off, and someone who doesn't mind him rippling his humour muscles every other sentence. Bad boys managed to do this in a spectacularly showy Hollywood blockbuster fashion, and to great effect. The symphony of a great soundtrack, believable acting, and a bigger budget than the Red Cross Aid to Rwanda, resulted in a pure adrenaline pumping movie experience.Blue Streak on the other hand seems to be Lawrence's attempt to stand-alone and away from what might have been perceived as celluloid crutches. Understandable really, the talented comedian wants to prove himself. However, it isn't quite managed in this albeit not-so-dumb plot of a jewel thief who, whilst escaping from the police manages to hide his goods in what will soon become the LA police department building. He only realises this after the building is finished. I won't give the game away as to how he goes about retrieving the jewel, but there are some genuinely funny moments which had me almost clutching my sides. Unfortunately, these funny moments, rather than being woven cleverly into the fabric of the film and the plot, appear to stand alone, like quick comedy sketches, almost as if we need to be reminded of what Lawrence is capable of.Lawrence has already proved his has comedy genius running through his blood, and that given the right material can have audiences caring for his character and laughing with him. However I think he needs stronger scripts if he is ever to go beyond the character he played in Bad Boys.Wait for this to adorn the local video or DVD rental store, and wait for Lawrence to get his teeth into something much more substantial.Harshad C.

To make the plot better and more interesting the writers have Lawrence in charge of the burglary division due to his knowledge.

Two years later he's out of jail but then finds that the building has become a major police station. He impersonates a cop to get into the building so that he can get his diamond back. Of course this isn't going to be easy.	Lawrence has been making a name for himself in films like Bad Boys opposite Will Smith, Life with Eddie Murphy and in Nothing To Lose with Tim Robbins. He's likeable on the screen and apparently a bit whacky off, with a drug bust last year, a popular TV series in the U.S. called Martin, and a famous collapse while jogging in L.A. in a heat wave. Gets a bit manic does our Martin apparently.	Blue Streak is mostly memorable for the hamming up Lawrence is allowed to do in this his first feature film out there on his own. Most of it works, some of it gets a bit tiresome but the overall package is enjoyable enough.	The early heist is a beauty with a clever depiction of the use of modern burglary equipment - well it looks pretty swishy to me anyway. I'm not that expert a burglar. I suppose we'll could check out the new James Bond film when it opens to see if Blue Streak is up to the mark in the high tech film thievery stakes.	But James Bond would never encourage a similar, light hearted, relaxed approach to robbery.	Miles posing as a detective occupies most of the film. It turns out that he's pretty good on the burglary squad, seems to be able to think like a burglar somehow.	The cops are played pretty dumb. They're nearly all white by the way, Lawrence isn't.They conveniently overlook that Miles's credentials don't add up, tempered by the fact that they find it refreshing that Miles is happy and willing to bash the prisoners around a bit. They haven't had the guts to do that, not in front of the social worker anyway for years.It pays not to take these sorts of films too seriously!	The other actors do well. Luke Wilson as Detective Carlson, William Forsythe as the Police Captain and Dave Chapelle as one of his fellow thieves flesh out the action with a fair bit of energy.	You won't be surprised to hear that Blue Streak is pretty much in Beverley Hills Cop territory and will be also pleased to hear that it is nearly as entertaining. The Eddie Murphy film though benefits from having a much more believable story line, not to mention that Eddie Murphy laugh.	But although Martin Lawrence struggles to entertain at times, Blue Streak will prompt a laugh or two, and that's not a bad idea.

The plot is rather formulaic a jewel thief hides a diamond in a construction building, goes to jail, finds the building is now a police station and impersonates a detective to get the diamond back.  His partner must be the obligatory `dumb white cop' played by Luke Wilson, who, frighteningly, reminds me of David Arquette.  Anyway, the movie is handled with skill.  The pacing is just right, the jokes are in the right place and Martin Lawrence is a comic genius.  The filmmakers know this movie isn't entirely original, but they have a lot of fun with it and it shows to the audience.  The action scenes are handled well, notably, the ending car chase scene.

Martin Lawrence gives a surprisingly funny and high-spirited performance that gives the movie a great energy that keeps it moving along through the mediocre script.  The pairing of Martin Lawrence with the hilarious Dave Chapelle (Half Baked) and Luke Wilson (Bottle Rocket) work very well, and make for some very funny scenes.  However, it's not all the comedy that makes Blue Streak well worth the $8.  The action and the plot are quite well thought out and involving, and the action scenes are rather exciting.  If you're a fan of Martin Lawrence, you'll love this one, and if you're not I'm sure you'll still find it has a lot of redeeming qualities.

Here's the rub. Years later after getting out of the joint, he comes to find out the building he hid the diamond in is now a police station.Sure the setup sounds unique, but believe me when I say nothing fresh ever comes of it. This is predictable filmmaking in every sense. One-liners, shoot-outs, an explosion or two and a side cast virtually wasted. That's Blue Streak. Lawrence mugs for the camera. William Forsythe gets the forgettable gruff Nick Nolte role. Luke Wilson gets to play the straight laced green second banana to Martin Lawrence. Peter Greene gets to play another heavy. It's cookie cutter product the likes of which we've been being feed forever. Whenever or not you buy into the fake cop act doesn't even seem to matter when the film can't sustain the funny. Logan bumbles his way through never raising an eye as the movie plays dumb for the sake of being dumb. A lot of people like this movie for reasons I don't quite understand, but then again, Blue Streak features an ending where we're supposed to feel good about a convicted thief escaping to Mexico with a stolen multi-million dollar diamond too.

The only requirement was to sit back and relax so the movie can carry me through. The story was quite unique having a thief pretend to be a police detective determined to collect a jewel left behind from a previous heist. To make the plot better and more interesting the writers make Lawrence's character in charge of the burglary division. Wilson didn't really add to the story and seemed to fill a role of sidekick. It was a pleasure to see William Forsythe in a role that did not have playing a villain. Overall, Blue Streak worked for me.

But one of his team betrays him (Peter Greene, once again playing a bad guy) and they're plan is thrown all out of whack. After hastily stashing the diamond in a nearby construction site he is soon arrested sent away for 2 years. Upon release he heads back to the construction site only to find it's turned into a police station. No luck getting back in unless you're a cop then. A series of disguises fail and Logan ends up impersonating a cop in order to get to the diamond. But he's so good at the impersonation that police duty gets in the way and he's partnered with Carlson (Luke Wilson).Mild plot complications ensue and it becomes increasingly difficult for Logan to get to the diamond. Though the trouble really starts when Deacon (Peter Greene) comes back to get him. It's all brainless stuff but it makes for enjoyably silly viewing. Lawrence's improv isn't all that funny but the rest of his performance is strangely tolerable. Wilson isn't his usual self in the wimpy cop role but it's weird watching him pronounce 'real OLD SCHOOL' 4 years before said movie was released. And Dave Chappelle is hilarious Tulley, the amateur liquor store robber.There was supposed to be a sequel but plans for it fell through. It would have been a hundred times better than the awful Bad Boys sequel regardless of script quality.The DVD is in bright, clean 1.851 anamorphic widescreen with a lively Dolby 5.1 soundtrack.

Logan gets away with the diamond, but after he manages to hide it in a nearby building, he gets arrested and sent to prison for two years.  When he gets out things don't go as well as planned.  Not with his girlfriend, and not with his search for the diamond.  It seems the building where he hid the diamond is now a police station.How to get in?  He tries disguising himself and poses as a pizza delivery man.  Unfortunately, he has to hand the pizzas over to rookie detective Carlson.  His next plan works a lot better  he gets a fake ID made, along with a phony badge and papers intended to convince the people in charge that he has been transferred there--at least for long  enough for him to get in and out with the diamond.  Things don't go smoothly in his search, and he gets sent out on a case--with Carlson!  Working his first case and a subsequent one, he makes good use of his 'expertise' to solve the crime. On the way back from the first case, Logan drives the car as if he was on 'The Dukes of Hazzard'.  The search for the diamond resumes, and Logan gets in more jams and manages to talk his way out of them.  He even gets promoted to lead detective in burglary!  Which makes his job even harder, but he can handle just about anything.Martin Lawrence is very funny, and he does the street-smart routine very well.  At one point he even shows adequate ability to handle drama.  The only other quality performance, if there was one, came from Peter Greene as Deacon, one of his former partners, who played his character straight, without comedy.  David Chappelle was funny too, in an Amos and Andy kind of way, as Logan's other partner.There was more violence than I would have liked, most of it toward the end (as is typical for this kind of movie), but it was tame compared to, say, a Schwarzenegger movie.  A good car chase (with at least one truck) came near the end. The language in the edited version I saw seemed to have been cleaned up quite a lot, which made me happy.  (The three-letter word for posterior came up a lot, even then)  Some crude humor, but not a great deal.I enjoyed this movie a lot.  Not for people looking for art, just a good time.***********************SPOILERS*********************On the way back from his first case, when Carlson stops to investigate a traffic accident, Logan goes in a mom-and-pop grocery, which is held up while he is there.  At first it appears Logan will do nothing, but when gunfire starts between the robber and the store owner, Logan steps in and the robber turns out to be ... TULLEY!Logan lets Tulley go but has the opportunity to make himself look good when the cops start chasing Tulley.  Lawrence is so good in the scene where Tulley is captured, and again in the interrogation room, where Logan is so (comically) violent!  Logan does the bad-cop routine again when he solves his second case, getting the suspect's lawyer riled.These cops must have been morons.  Carlson does figure out Logan wasn't a real cop, but that's no problem.  Logan immediately claims to be from internal affairs.  Later, it becomes clear Logan was planted by the FBI.Logan manages to sneak Tulley out of jail, and the former partner shows up again to wreck Logan's attempt at a drug bust (a cover for getting the diamond back after he dropped it in the drugs being used as evidence in another case; the evidence was bait to attract a major dealer).  But so does Deacon.After the big chase leads to the Mexican border, the cops can't cross to get Deacon. Logan can, of course (after all, he isn't a real cop).  Lawrence was great in that scene. The feds blow his cover once again, so what does Logan do?  He's part Mexican!  He's actually a Federale!********************SPOILER if you didn't think anything up until now was a SPOILER*****************No, Carlson knows who he is.  He's not so dumb.  Carlson knows he's a burglar.  But Logan is still in Mexico.  So Carlson is not going to cross. He just lets Logan go.  Great ending, though I was sort of hoping he'd become a real cop.

I think he is hilarious.  When he had a supporting role in Boomerang, he was the best part of the film.  When he teamed with Will Smith in Bad Boys, the result was TNT.  Their chemistry together made the film as funny and successful as it was.  But when you put him in a film that has one of the sorriest excuses for a script that I have seen in some time, no matter how much of a genius he is, it is not enough to save the movie from disaster.  I really get bothered by films like this because someone along the Hollywood chain actually read this script and thought it was funny enough to invest money into it.  And I wonder what Lawrence actually thought when he read it.  My best guess is that he took one look at it and thought that he could do what Jim Carrey did with Ace Ventura, take the script and put his own brand of humour in it.  And while that worked for Carrey, there was no way in hell that it was going to work for this film.  No way!I'll dissect some simple silly scenes for you and then maybe you can decide for yourself.  Lawrence's main nemesis is an old robbery buddy that thrives on greed.  He finds out Lawrence's scam and decides he is going to wait for him to make a move and then grab the diamond for himself.  So as soon as he sees the white truck leaving the police station ( followed by about 8 police cars ) he decides to follow it and snatch the diamond from Lawrence.  Okay, let's see first of all, how did he know that Lawrence was going to be in that particular truck, secondly, why would he follow the truck when there is a harem of cops following it as well.  These are just small points that perhaps you overlook in a film if the film itself is good.  But when it is as pathetic as this one is, every fault, every glitch stares out at you like a full moon on a clear night.  Lawrence does what he can with the script but he is outmatched by sheer idiocy and there is nothing he can do about it.  I won't even go into the fact that his cover would have been blown in about a day, and that is being kind.  Blue Streak is an amateur production at best.  It sinks in it's own slush and it is a film that never should have been made.  I think it's really sad when you see what depths the film industry has sunk to to get a film in the can and out into the market.  I have to admit that this summer there were quite a few films that surprised me.  Usually summer blesses us with maybe two or three good films, but this time I can count about ten that were quite good.  You can add this film to one of the biggest disappointments, and considering it had a great trailer, it makes it that much more depressing.  So here is my advice to two of the abominations that came out this summer.  I think the makers of the trailers for The Haunting and Blue Streak should pitch an idea to the studios and tell them that they will direct.  After all, the makers of the trailers for those two movies are brilliant people.  They made me want to see their films.  It's just too bad that the rest of the film couldn't follow in their footsteps.

I like Martin Lawrence, and this is his first work I recall disliking--and somewhat hating!  I own his comedy CD Funk That, I always liked his show, I liked his supporting roles in the first two House Party movies, I thought Nothing to Lose was hilarious, I liked the underrated comedy Life and I even liked his lesser-known comedy/directorial debut A Thin Line Between Love and Hate. So if you think BS is catered for Lawrence fans only...think again!  This is the standard slapstick Hollywood fluff that's been fed to us throughout modern times.  Completely silly and sometimes predictable.  Why a surprising amount of critics found this film relentlessly funny (even Jeffrey Lyons!) is a total enigma!First of all, we're in the age of PG-13 comedies, since filmmakers feel that R-rated comedies don't bring in the big bucks.  So we've been seeing a lot of these watered-down, PG-13 comic vehicles.  And for Lawrence, who's used to inserting the f word into virtually every sentence, it seems even more watered down.  There's a fine line between a comedy that is meant to be PG-13 (i.e.  Barcelona or Metropolitan) and one that is censored for the MPAA.  And it's getting quite easy to tell the difference.I remember laughing a total of 3 times (and one was a mixture of a groan and laugh).  Two of them were from one-liners by Lawrence (which he probably improvised) and another was a scene involving rubbing ointment on a part of a body I will not point out.  Every scene seems as if it's going to build up to a hilarious punchline, but falls flat on its face with uninspired gags that could've been written by a gorilla.  Not to mention it centers around a senseless, one-joke premise.  You really think EVERYBODY on the police force is going to believe that Lawrence is actually a cop?  If this were real life, he would've been pointed out in the blink of an eye.  And then we have the great veteran actor William Forsythe who's the most gullible and comments (after seeing Lawrence slap his buddy/thief Dave Chappelle around the interrogation room in a totally unfunny scene) You don't get that training at the Academy.  Even farce needs some degree of reality.And to top it off...we have a tedious, 20-minute car chase/climax!  Isn't that great?  Why did Roger Ebert, who usually hates car chases in movies, think this one was exciting in particular?  How was this any different?The whole movie revolves around Lawrence about to get caught impersonating an officer of the law, and he tries to get out of each situation by...making the most ridiculous excuses!  Being silly!  Being obnoxious!  Making the best (which is impossible) out of a crappy, crappy script!  All he does is make a total ass of himself.  Not funny.  Just stupid.  Lawrence, a very talented comedian, has nothing to work with!  So he's stuck trying to make each scene funny by being over-the-top, not realizing that successful punchlines are impossible in a flat comedy like this.If you want to see Lawrence at his best, watch any of his aforementioned comedies.  This is only worthy if you're willing to see a comedic talent be humiliated to death.My score  3 (out of 10)   "},{"Title":"Lawrence grows his own Streak.","Date":"24 September 1999","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":"  Lawrence and buddies make the ultimate diamond heist.

BLUE STREAK is a surprisingly enjoyable cop caper comedy with Martin Lawrence. It's not the best kind, but it's done with highly effective humor, mostly delivered by Lawrence and co-stars like Dave Chapelle, Luke Wilson and William Forsythe. BLUE STREAK is not great, perhaps not as good as other entries in the genre, but it's an effective one it it gets it done with fun and wit. Few comedies are this at least funny, some are hardly funny at all.Lawrence plays top thief Miles Logan, who has just stolen a priceless diamond, but quickly pursued by the police. When he is almost captured, he hid the diamond inside a ceiling of an unfinished building. He is captured, imprisoned and a few years later, released. Now he can just go back and get his rock. But getting that rock may just be harder than he thought. Turns out, the building's finished, and it turns out to be a police station. To get to his rock, he has to dress up as a detective and boss around his partner (Wilson) and a couple of thugs, some of which he works with, including an annoying lousy thief (Chapelle).The premise is such a good idea, but, unlike other comedies that hardly make it out of the board meetings, BLUE STREAK effectively delivers. Director Les Mayfield is very playful and stylish, and the comedy bits offered in the script and delivered by Lawrence with great glee make one fine comedy. The film is devoid of any brilliance, and it's not 100% great and funny, but it's at most, good at what it's doing. It's better than the usual fare, and the usual fare usually stinks. BLUE STREAK doesn't bring new things in its bag of tricks, but it does the job... and it gets its rock.Rating *** out of 5.

However, his partner betrays him and the diamond is now somewhere in a police station, where the vault used to be!!! Now he has to find a way to get it back.

But BLUE STREAK is pretty funny, as Lawrence plays a thief trying to retrieve a diamond as big as the Ritz. This started out as a BEVERLY HILLS COP-type R-rated action comedy but was pared down to a PG-13 for some unknown reason. Maybe because Lawrence isn't Eddie Murphy? And for that matter, Murphy himself is doing a lot of PG-13 and PG movies these days. Watch closely and you can see slight vestiges of the R this might have been, especially in the final shootout. With BLUE STREAK, Lawrence will keep you laughing or at least entertained. This 1999 movie has become a TV favorite, much like GLADIATOR and LETHAL WEAPON.

Take Robin Williams and Jim Carrey, for example.  Do you try to keep them from doing their `shtick', as Gus Van Sant did with the former in `Good Will Hunting' or Milos Forman with the latter in `Man on the Moon?'  Do you let the shtick dominate the movie as Barry Levinson did with Williams in `Good Morning, Vietnam' and Tom Shadyac did with Carrey in `Liar, Liar?'  Or do you allow for just a little shtick, as Peter Weir did with both in `Dead Poets Society' and `The Truman Show,' respectively?  All of these directors made the right choices.  Others have not been as fortunate.Les Mayfield chose the third option for Martin Lawrence in `Blue Streak,' and the result is a delightful, surprisingly subdued comedy.  The plot is far-fetched, to say the least  A thief steals a diamond, but is forced to hide it in a building that is under construction.  Released from jail two years later, he discovers that the building has turned out to be a police station.  The only way he can get into the station is to pose as a cop.The central issue of course is whether Lawrence will get the diamond before he's discovered.  But midway through the movie we realize that because the Lawrence character is a thief he  thinks like a thief, and that gives him an advantage over the other cops in solving crimes.  You come to believe that he could pull off a stunt like this.  This despite the fact that Lawrence pauses occasionally to do shtick. It doesn't hurt that Lawrence is surrounded by a first-rate cast  Luke Wilson as his inexperienced partner, Peter Greene as the villain, David Chappelle as a former partner in crime who plays off beautifully against Lawrence, and William Forsythe as a cop appropriately named Hardcastle.Add a believable unbelievable ending, and you have a surprisingly good comedy.

As he single-handedly is responsibly for uncountable arrests and insights (if only the police could have a criminal mind and do what Logan does?).  but alas this is holywood,... and if you are not in the mood for comedy, then the line must be drawn because you probably will not enjoy the movie.Why 1-you notice the rip offs of other moviesFor example the beginning action scence is very similar to the beginning of Bad Boys, where the Bad Boys are out to steal something though lots of gadgets. (Another tie-in is COPS Bad boys bad boys, what ...)2-you will notice massive errors in thought and logic. a-Logan gets access to the Dept. because he stole and copied an ID card.  Wouldn't the ID be deactivated as soon as it is reported lost? b-Logan's partner is initially suposed to be stupid/new, but wouldn't he at least now what radio station his car is set to? (or at least what type of music).Anyway, with the speed of the humor, it is easy to miss the errors and just sit-back, relax, and enjoy the show.

On finding the building to be an LAPD centre, he disguises himself as a cop to recover the precious object.Martin Lawrence shone in Bad Boys and that reason alone was enough for me to sit down and watch this 1999 crime comedy and not only did I find it to be a waste of time, but a picture that is an abomination to everything it supposedly stands for.Having films simply for entertainment is too easy in modern cinema. Films that make us think and still manage that fun factor are the ones that get us reminiscing.With Lawrence's comic background this was always going to be a further selling point for his career, and it didn't do much for him either when looking at his recent flops such as Wild Hogs. His hard attitude and geek like imitations (shiver at the thought of his pizza man) are some of the worst comedy ever to emerge on a screen, (this review written by a guy who has seen Disaster Movie). His timing and bizarre rough language fails to interest and importantly fails to entertain, which destroys the whole appeal of the film. Based around Miles from the get go, he is left out of about 5 scenes and with this terrible character who thinks he is 'it' and simply beats hard working professionals makes this worse than sitting on a cactus.The plot, as if not obvious enough already, follows Miles on a hunt to track down the diamond and to do that he must become a good guy (his comic 'appeal' make him feel like a good guy anyway) The movie is consistently awful with its poor central character, bad humour and exceptionally weak portrayal of cops.The humour from other characters could possibly have saved it, if they were interesting, funny and actual people with personalities.The representation of the force is egregious, a typical bunch of cops who haven't got a clue, eat donuts and can't drive properly, unless they are taught how by an idiotic character who is brand new to the team.It is hard to believe the interesting funny guy from Bad Boys leads the way in this picture. Blue Streak is a shocking excuse for a crime comedy with predictability written on the cover, awful representations and stereotypes.

Five minutes of this is ok, but watching Blue Streak is like being forced to watch three consecutive episodes of Lawrence's equally annoying and pointless sitcom but with some gratuitous (albeit PG-13 rated) violence. I guess we're supposed to laugh at police beating arrestees as long as there is no blood involved.The intro is all right, reminiscent of Hudson Hawk, but already after three minutes you've got the entire movie set out and you know how it's going to end.

After a short while you start to wish that they'd all get into a major gun battle and die, especially Lawrences hyper active and overplayed (and decidedly not funny) con-turned-fake-cop.

Martin Lawrence, though a likable and energetic performer, is, alas, no Jim Carrey in the pratfall-and-mugging department and the film suffers as a result of it.  Lawrence portrays a wiseguy burgler who, through a slew of plot complications, finds himself masquerading as an iconoclastic police detective while endeavoring to retrieve the $17 million jewel he left behind in his last heist (in a building that has now been coverted into a downtown police station).  The modus operandi of these films - besides the inevitable car chases, shoot outs and, in this case, really queasy happy ending - is that, for the hipster comic's persona to work, all the characters surrounding him have to be dumber than dirt.

When I saw it, I was guessing what the plot was, what was going on, and how it ended. And when I saw the movie, I was right, it's a typical loud and unfunny comedy that Hollywood puts out in the fall. That way it can do a lot of business, since there's nothing else really out.BLUE STREAK stars Martin (Whas Up?!?!) Lawrence as Miles Logan, a master thief who breaks into a very secure safe and steals a diamond that's worth $17 million dollars. However, one of Logan's partners can't be trusted, as he tries to sabotage the diamond, Miles hides the diamond in a air condition vent in a building under construction just before he gets arrested by the police and is put in jail.Two years later, Miles is released from jail, and he wants his diamond. But, surprise, surprise! The building that was under construction is now the new L.A. police department! So Miles figures that there is only way to get into the police only building, get fake i.d and become a cop himself. Now the L.A. police department sees him as the new homicide detective and team him up with the clumsy Carlson (Luke Wilson). While watching BLUE STREAK, I saw this as another retrend of BEVERLY HILLS COP. Where Martin Lawrence is the only hip and cool person, while the cops are stiff and uncool. Also I noticed how the rest of the officers were extrmely unintelligent while Lawrence seemed to be the only intelligent person in the film. And Lawrence is the only officer who can abuse a criminal, and get away with it.The logic and story of BLUE STREAK has plot holes to drive a armor truck through (and like BEVERLY HILLS COP 2 and BAD BOYS, they use a armor vehicle in this film also). Plus since it's suppose to be a joke or comedy movie, the jokes aren't that funny. In fact, they are quite annoying. The only person that provides laughs isn't Lawrence, but David Chappelle (from CON-AIR, HALF-BAKED, and 200 CIGARETTES). Chappelle, to me, was the most energenic and funniest character in the film. I would have rather seen the story follow Chappelle than Lawrence. But when you have a film written by three people, that is usually trouble, since they sometimes have good ideas (like the beginning heist scene), and bad (the rest of the film).Also, why is there a kid sitting on a bike watching Tamala Jones chew out Martin Lawrence? I mean, didn't director Les Mayfield do another take without the kid being there, since the kid probably sneak onto the set? That pretty much sums up this movie, a mess with too many mistakes. I guess if you see this film, you can play connect the character's and action scenes with BEVERLY HILLS COP. Like Martin Lawrence is Eddie Murphy, Luke Wilson is Judge Reinhold, William Forsythe is John Ashton, etc. etc. Otherwise, don't really bother with this film. ** (out of five) "},{"Title":"Pitiful american comedy !","Date":"3 June 2000","Score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":"  Seeing all the positive comments 'down there', i felt obliged to comment on this....I saw Blue Streak on the plane on my way back from Argentina, and it is the most sorry excuse for a comedy i have ever seen....the jokes are either not funny, cliched or just plain dumb.

But it may receive one notable accolade despite itself the title of worst movie of the year.For two hours the audience is treated to highly contrived scenes where Logan is constantly in the wrong place at the wrong time and, disregarding all ramifications of his actions, dispenses his own brand of vigilante justice. He chases robbers across the Mexican border despite the fact they are out of his jurisdiction; he searches trucks without a warrant; he beats suspects into confessing crimes.For his actions Logan should have been fired hundreds of time over. But since this is a movie, and because Lawrence is the star, he instead earns the respect of the entire dim-witted police force, including Carlson (Luke Wilson), his rookie partner who acts like he just transferred from Mayberry.Despite Logan's incredibly suspicious behavior (he's caught about half a dozen times scouring the air vents for starters), his colleagues fail to put two and two together. When they do ask questions, Logan is able to fend them off with ludicrous stories that only the most brain dead of human beings would believe. He is treated as a savior of a department which has been on the hot seat of late due to its perceived incompetence. Since these detectives are unable to uncover Logan's true identity considering his paper-thin alibis, it's safe to say the criticism was justified.There's no disguising Blue Streak, however, for what it is a poorly written, acted and directed debacle only brought to the big screen due to Columbia Pictures' evident desire for the almighty dollar.At the root of the problem is the pathetic effort put forward by scribes John Blumenthal and Michael Berry. The pair, whose only other writing credits are for the 1990 film Short Time starring Dabney Coleman, seem to have written only a vague outline of staged formulatic scenes and left the cast and crew to figure out the rest.  Director Les Mayfield, previously responsible for the dismal failures Flubber and Encino Man, makes it 0-for-three.  Not one scene evolves with any kind of purpose other than to accent Lawrence's comic stylings.Lawrence really can't be blamed for anything other than signing on to what he should have been able to tell was destined to be a bad film. Throughout the film he gives his best efforts to generate laughs, even dressing as a pizza delivery guy that bears a striking resemblance to Ol' Dirty Bastard. Unfortunately he lacks the charisma and comic timing to carry a film as he is asked to do. It's seriously doubtful whether, placed in more capable hands, the picture could have been a success. But with Lawrence trying vainly to salvage the film all by himself, Blue Streak proves to be a failure in every way imaginable.

His brand of comedy ranges from the pratfall antics of Jerry Lewis to the more vibrant delivery of someone like Richard Pryor, yet asking him to carry a movie on his own is still risky at best. He has achieved a level of success by having the knack to raise a laugh out of the most moronic of situations, and here in Blue Streak he milks it for all he is worth, and I personally find the film a good cure for the blues.Miles Logan (Lawrence) gets caught post a diamond robbery, luckily for him he has hidden the diamond in an air vent at a building that is under construction, unluckily for him tho, is that when he gets out of prison two years later, he finds that the building under construction is now a police station! This sets us up for the splendid plot of criminal wise cracker Logan having to fake being a police officer to hopefully get his hands back on the diamond! Naturally things don't go to plan and things steadily spiral out of control.The film is fun, it doesn't have an overlong running time, so with that the viewer doesn't feel a sense of too much Lawrence overacting, some solid support from Luke Wilson & William Forsythe adds to the merriment, and the action junkies are suitably catered for as well, so all in all a very solid 6.5/10 from me.

Cast as Miles J. Logan, a career jewel thief who swipes a $17-million diamond and stashes it seconds before the cops cuff him, Lawrence steals the show when he masquerades later as an LAPD burglary detective to recover his ill-gotten gains. Director Les Mayfield never lets the lack of logic interfere with the loads of laughs. Anybody who enjoyed Lawrence in either Bad Boys or his canceled Fox sit-com Martin should relish this clever synthesis of Beverly Hills Cop meets 48 Hrs. Blue Streak opens with an exciting 13-minute cliffhanger sequence. Miles and his crew of high-tech thieves slide down an elevator shaft in a downtown L.A. skyscraper at night to filch a diamond from a heavily guarded museum. They disarm the alarm system with mini-computers, narrowly avoiding the guards patrolling the premises, and Miles rips off the rock. Deke (the ever sinister Peter Greene who played Zed in Pulp Fiction) acts as their last-minute tech replacement guy who jams the security monitors and keeps them abreast about where the rent-a-cops are in the building. After Eddie (John Hawkes), Miles' right hand man, rejoins Deke on the roof, Deke shows his true colors and guns him down then awaits Logan to double-cross him, too. Eddie does a header off the roof, crashing into a police cruiser, while the cops are grilling Miles' chain-smoking getaway driver, Tulley (Dave Chapelle). Before Deke can get the diamond from Miles, the police storm the building, and Tulley peels away in a cloud of rubber.Meanwhile, Miles eludes the trigger-happy Deke at a construction site across the street from the museum. They escape by means of a cable stretched between the buildings, sliding along it on a hand-car. Half-way between the buildings, Miles realizes that he is heading straight for Deke who has him framed in his gun sights. At the last second, Miles cuts the cable and plunges Tarzan style a couple of floors below where Deke is waiting for him. Although Miles outsmarts Deke, the men-in-blue collar him moments after our hard luck hero hides the diamond in a ventilator shaft. A fuming Deke watches in frustration as the fuzz lead Miles away in cuffs.Director Les (Flubber) Mayfield gets Blue Streak off to a sizzling start. The snappy prologue recalls the daring rooftop heist at police headquarters in Bad Boys where thieves raided the evidence locker for narcotics. Mayfield deserves credit for adequately establishing a basis for everything that follows in Blue Streak. This slickly produced comedy of errors and mistaken identities rarely strays from the sure-fire action comedy formula that catapulted Eddie Murphy to fame in Beverly Hills Cop. While they keep the story simple and straightforward, scenarists Michael Berry, John Blumenthal, and Steve Carpenter never let Miles off the hook. No sooner has our hero extracted himself from one tight spot than he finds himself entangled in an even tighter one! Two years in prison elapse in flash for Miles, and he finds himself back on the street, minus one shoelace but eager to hook up with his girlfriend. As it turns out, Janiece (Tamala Jones), who never visited him while he served time, refuses to have anything to do with him. This predictable but entertaining buddy picture/action comedy covers familiar terrain. Nevertheless, the writers enliven Lawrence's escapades with several surprise twists and turns. During a snack break at a stop'n shop store, Miles runs into Tulley. His ex-getaway driver has turned to robbery, which he shows little aptitude for, and the store clerk cuts loose with a hail of gunfire that sends both guys scrambling to the floor. Suddenly, the cops have them surrounded, and the SWAT team is in route. Miles explains that he has to arrest Tulley, so he can maintain his charade long enough to recover the diamond. Reluctantly, Tulley surrenders his machine gun, but only after Miles cuts him in for share of the diamond. The police are suitably impressed when Miles, a.k.a. Det. Malone, displays some fancy kung fu footwork to disarm the unsuspecting Tulley.Primarily, Mayfield and his scenarists keep Miles jumping through hoops as he struggles to recoup the jewel and avoid a encounter with Deke. No matter how closely Miles gets to the diamond, the diamond itself seems to evade recovery. This strategy serves as a variation on the gag where a guy leans over to retrieve his hat and inadvertently kicks it out of reach before he can pick it up. Wisely, Mayfield keeps Martin Lawrence front and center throughout Blue Streak. Happily, Lawrence makes the most of his first, full-fledged starring role, after sharing the limelight with Will Smith in Bad Boys, Tim Robbins in Nothing to Lose, and Eddie Murphy in Life. Never off screen for long, Martin Lawrence gives a shamelessly hammy performance. Were it not the PG-13 rated movie, he would probably have spewed more profanity, but the absence of foul language doesn't detract from the fast-paced action. Peter Greene makes a vicious villain, and Dave Chappelle is hilarious as Miles' old getaway driver.Sensibly, Mayfield pares the action down to its absolute essentials and keeps the throttle wide open during its trim 93 minute running time. Of course, Miles' ability to fool the police strains credibility severely; no way he could keep deluding them with his constantly outlandish lies, but Mayfield doesn't linger any longer than he must on these pesky problems. Romantic subplots are given short shrift, and at times, you wonder if the filmmakers had bigger ambitions than their budget could afford. The last third of the movie focuses on Miles' efforts to bust a major drug dealer, but Mayfield shortchanges this sequence in order to maintain momentum.Martin Lawrence's grandstanding antics make Blue Streak worth watching.

Basically Miles Logan (Martin Lawrence) and his accomplices, including greedy Deacon (Pulp Fiction's Peter Greene), are stealing a diamond worth $17 million in Los Angeles, but then things go wrong and Miles is forced to hide it is an air vent until he can return and collect it. Two years later, after he has served time in prison for being part of the robbery, he returns to see his ex-girlfriend Janiece (Tamala Jones) who swiftly throws him out upon finding out that he a jewel thief, so he decides all he can do is go back for the diamond. Miles is very disappointed to see that the building he tried to steal the diamond from has become a new police headquarters, so he briefly poses as a ghetto pizza delivery man to steal an ID card. His contact Uncle Lou (Richard C. Sarafian) makes him a good looking fake police ID card, and he watches some cop shows to complete his persona, as he poses as a rookie Detective Malone sent to the department from West Covina. He tries a few times to find a way into the air vent from the robbery, but he keeps getting interrupted at a good moment, and after unintentionally foiling a prisoner escape he is partnered with naive Detective Carlson (Luke Wilson, Owen's brother). Miles teaches Carlson many tricks of how to catch criminals and foil their crimes, and with his insight into the criminal mind he has gained in his time he is unintentionally becoming a high profile officer. He even foils a robbery by his own former accomplice Tulley (The Nutty Professor's Dave Chappelle), where a truck load of heroine is taken, and he ends up promoted to Lead Detective of the Burglary Division, admired by his fellow officers. Eventually Miles manages to find and hold the diamond, but interrupted again he drops it in the stash of heroine shipment, and he is told to be part of a sting operation to catch a gang of drugs smugglers, and he convinces the boss to use the shipment as bait. At the delivery bust he meets smuggling expert Jean LaFleur (Home Alone 3's Olek Krupa, as well as Deacon who recognises him, but after a big shoot out and chase he gets shot by Miles, and even though Carlson and one of two other cops find out who he is, Miles is allowed to go across the Mexican border with the diamond.
