And as far as Gwen Paltrow's accent is concerned, I must confess I wasn't too familiar with her when I saw this at the theater initially, and I was absolutely convinced at the time that she was an English actress!I am taken aback by those who criticized the film for its lush scenery. That is one of the things I enjoy and look forward to seeing in period pieces set in the English countryside. The film's beautiful backgrounds are a major contributor to its appeal and success. If your idea of escapist fare is something bleaker, then perhaps you should rent something like Death Wish III!The English country settings are as attractive and charming as the cast, and combine with the story and soundtrack for entertainment that makes you not tire of repeat viewings. McGrath is a wonder at choreographing the interplay of subtle expressions that are so essential in conveying the complicated romantic intrigue that occurs in this story.This refreshing movie could also be a clinic on how enjoyable a film can be minus sex, violence or even a villainous antagonist. The story is often amusing, endearing, and at times, quite touching.I have seen many competent Jane Austen book adaptations but this is without question my favorite.

Toni Collette was great as Harriett Smith.The character who stole the film was MISS BATES!!! She was mesmerizing to watch, one finds oneself on the edge of ones' seat just hanging on her every word and laughing hysterically WITH her. One of the most endearing characters I have come across in ages. From one of the opening scenes when she is thanking Mr. Woodhouse for sending that lovely quarter-hind of pork... PORK, MOTHER!!! she shouts into her daffy and clearly hearing impaired Mother, Mrs. Bates (played by Emma Thompson's mother, Phyllida Law) who looks forlorn and lost.The comical ways that Emma would avoid the grating Miss Bates builds itself up for one truly gut-wrenching scene at the picnic when Emma insults Miss Bates who takes her cruel dig to her heart. We then see poor Miss Bates stammering and on the verge of tears and just so crushed one can not help but feel one's heart ripped out to her on her behalf. It is a classic scene, one to be rewound and played over & over...The ending is right up there with Sense & Sensibility and provides one of life's greatest lessons about how one should marry one's best friend...I hope that this film delights you all as much as it has myself.I ADORED it!

But the real 'find' is Jeremy Northam as Mr Knightley. There could not be more perfect casting, IMO. I hated Mr K in the novel, but found him wonderfully human and humane in the film. Northam's good looks and smiling eyes are no hindrance to enjoyment, either! Highly recommended.

I had long since gone off the woman and still feel she is rather dull in her Oscar-winning Shakespeare In Love performance but she gets all the beats right here--she is nigh on perfect as Emma Woodhouse.  She may have won her Oscar for Shakespeare but she should be remembered for this.Of course, she's surrounded by a great supporting cast including Toni Collette, Greta Scacchi, Juliette Stevenson et al...Jeremy Northam is very appealing as the love interest, even if the script wallows a bit in his declaration of love to Paltrow (in the process, allowing all of the tension to drain out of their relationship); several years on, Ewan's hair is a little easier to take than it was in '96 and, personally, I find puckish Alan Cumming a grating presence in anything nowadays.  But the standout is, without a doubt, Sophie Thompson (sister of Emma Thompson, daughter of Phyllida Law) as Miss Bates; what this version needs is a scene where Emma reconciles with Miss Bates, as she is the character to whose fate we are drawn.  The film is worth watching (again even) for her performance alone.All in all, this has aged wonderfully with charm to spare and more than enough subtlety to sort out the British class system.  Well worth a rental (because its unlikely that Paltrow will ever be this good again--but we'll always have Emma). "},{"Title":"Paltrow Perfect","Date":"19 November 2001","Score":"24 out of 30 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  	Romance is in the air and love is in bloom in Victorian era England, in this light-hearted story set against a society in a time in which manners were still in vogue, the ladies were charming and elegant, and the gentlemen dashing.  `Emma,' based on the novel by Jane Austen and written for the screen and directed by Douglas McGrath, stars the lovely Gwyneth Paltrow in the title role.  A self-appointed matchmaker, Emma takes great delight in the romantic notion of playing Cupid and attempting to pair up those she feels are suited to one another.  Coming off a successful matching that ended in marriage, she next sets her sights on finding a mate for her friend, Harriet (Toni Collette), but the outcome of her initial attempt proves to be less than satisfying.  Meanwhile, her endeavors are tempered by by the handsome Mr. Knightley (Jeremy Northam), whose insights into matters of the heart often seem to be a bit more astute than Emma's, and lend some needed balance to the proceedings.  And Emma, so concerned with what is right for others, neglects the heart that is actually the most important of all  Her own.  The world goes &#145;round and love abounds, but Emma is about to miss the boat.  Luckily for her, however, the is someone just right for her waiting in the wings.  Now, if she can but stop long enough to realize it.  But as everyone who has known true love knows, matters of the heart can go right or wrong in an instant, depending upon the slightest thing; and while romance is at hand for Emma, she must first recognize it, and seize the moment.	McGrath has crafted and delivered a delightful, feel-good film that is like a breath of fresh air in our often turbulent world.  There may be an air of frivolity about it, but in retrospect, this story deals with something that is perhaps the most important thing there is-- in all honesty-- to just about anyone  Love.  And with McGrath's impeccable sense of pace and timing, it all plays out here in a way that is entirely entertaining and enjoyable.  It's a pleasant, affecting film, with a wonderful cast, that successfully transports the viewer to another time and another place.  It's light fare, but absorbing; and the picturesque settings and proceedings offer a sense of well-being and calm that allows you to immerse yourself in it and simply go with the flow.	The winsome Paltrow, who won the Oscar for best actress for `Shakespeare In Love' two years after making this one, seems comfortable and right at home in this genre.  She personifies all things British, and does it with such naturalness and facility that it's the kind of performance that is easily taken for granted or overlooked altogether.  She's simply so good at what she does and makes it look so easy.  She has a charismatic screen presence and an endearing manner, very reminiscent of Audrey Hepburn.  Yet Paltrow is unique.  As an actor, she has a wide range and style and has demonstrated-- with such films as `Hard Eight,' `Hush' and `A Perfect Murder'-- that she can play just about any part effectively, and with that personal touch that makes any role she plays her own.  But it's with characters like Emma that she really shines.  She is so expressive and open, and her personality is so engaging, that she is someone to whom it is easy to relate and just a joy to watch, regardless of the part she is playing.  And for Emma, she is absolutely perfect.	Jeremy Northam also acquits himself extremely well in the role of Knightley, and like Paltrow, seems suited to the genre-- in the right role, that is; his performance in the more recent `The Golden Bowl,' in which he played an Italian Prince, was less than satisfying.  Here, however, he is perfect; he is handsome, and carries himself in such a way that makes Knightley believable and very real.  Like Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy in the miniseries `Pride and Prejudice,' Northam has created a memorable character with his own Mr. Knightley.	Also excellent in supporting roles and worthy of mention are Toni Collette, as Emma's friend Harriet Smith; and Alan Cumming, as the Reverend Elton.  Respectively, Collette and Cumming create characters who are very real people, and as such become a vital asset to the overall success of this film.  And it demonstrates just how invaluable the supporting players are in the world of the cinema, and to films of any genre.	The supporting cast includes Greta Scacchi (Mrs. Weston), Denys Hawthorne (Mr. Woodhouse), Sophie Thompson (Miss Bates), Kathleen Byron (Mrs. Goddard), Phyllida Law (Mrs. Bates), Polly Walker (Jane Fairfax) and Ewan McGregor (Frank Churchill).  An uplifting, elegant film, `Emma' is a reminder of civilized behavior and the value of gentleness and grace in a world too often beset with unpleasantness.  And even if it's only through the magic of the silver screen, it's nice to be able to escape to such a world as this, if only for a couple of hours, as it fulfills the need for that renewal of faith in the human spirit.  And that's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10.

But if you're willing to view Emma with the belief that this movie is loosely based on the novel, and enjoy it on its own merits, you'll truly enjoy yourself.Emma (Gwyneth Paltrow) is the apple of her aged father's eye and spends her ample free time trying to play matchmaker. Having achieved some success by matching her own governess with the widowed Mr. Weston, Emma sets out to match easily persuaded, impoverished newcomer Harriet Smith (Toni Collete) with hilarious results. Some have complained that the casting is all wrong but I don't agree. I think for the comedic spirit of the film, the actors were well chosen. Sophie Thompson nearly steals the show as the muddled but happy Miss Bates. Her silent mother, Mrs. Bates (played by Sophie Thompson's real-life mother Phyllida Law), also steals a few scenes. In my humble opinion, anybody who prefers Mark Strong (the A&E version) over Jeremy Northam in the role of Mr. Knightley has to be addled in the attic as it were. Not tall enough? I'm sorry but I wasn't watching how tall he was but that mesmerizing smile. I'm sure I wasn't the only one swooning in my seat.This is no literary classic (the movie NOT the book!) so let's not make it something it isn't. What Emma truly IS..is an enjoyable romp with a healthy dollop of romance. Viewed in this light, you're in for a good time.And yes, Ewan McGregor's wig IS hideous.

Good, but not brilliant.The cinematography is inventive, crossing at times the border to gimmickry, but it certainly avoids the trap of making this look like a boring TV soap in costumes, given that the entire story is dialogue-driven.The acting is competent.  Ms Paltrow is aloof, as her character requires, but the required distance from the other characters is accompanied by a much less appropriate detachment from her own actions.  In other words, she does not seem to care enough of the results of her match-making endeavours.  Some of the supporting cast is guilty of over-acting - very much in the style that is appreciated on stage but out of place in motion pictures.  Personally, I had problems accepting Alan Cumming as Mr Elton - to no fault of his own, except for having left such an impression as a gay trolley-dolly in The High Life that it is now difficult to accept him playing any serious part.  Acting honours go to Toni Collette who manages to radiate warmth, and Jeremy Northam who pitches his character at just the right level.

I've never seen Gwyneth Paltrow in a more convincing performance, and Jeremy Northam is the perfect Mr Knightley - where does one meet such a man??? <<<sigh>>> Sophie Thompson's turn as Ms Bates is virtuoso acting of the finest (oh, napkins, sorry!) and the rest of the cast is no disappointment either - Toni Colette brings a lot of Muriel to her Harriet, and Ewan McGregor is convincingly charming - and Alan Cumming and Juliet Stevenson are the perfect impossible couple!Of course the sets and costumes, and the beautiful soundtrack contribute a lot to the feelgood, almost Hobbiton-like atmosphere of the movie - although as far as cinematography and art decoration go, it's almost a case of visual overload. Very very pretty, but a little more austerity might have conveyed a better sense of period. But the good thing is, the movie doesn't take itself too seriously, and there is plenty of fun - and some pretty cool editing - that keep it from sinking into saccharine Merry Old England mode.My particular favorite is the ball scene - some beautiful acting and directing here, and the concluding dance summarizes the relationship between Emma and Mr Knightley just beautifully. Pity that the final proposal scene goes on for just a little too long - cut two shots (I can think of exactly which ones!) and it would have been much more in keeping with the rest of the movie.Gosh, I just realize (by reading the imdb listings) that I've seen Jeremy Northam in at least three movies without even being aware that it was him - seems he's got a lot more going for him, as an actor, than just being a gentlemanlike English heartthrob! Hmm, guess I need to pay my video store a visit...Lovely movie. My favorite Jane Austen adaptation so far - though perhaps Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility is, strictly speaking, the better movie, this one is closest to my heart - and I've certainly seen it many more times!

So I am at a loss to explain how it was that such refined and apt staging was accomplished. There are some very adroit transitions between scenes, which alone make this actual cinema rather than mere illustrated text. There is an accomplished use of architecture in framing shots that similarly transports us from the page. And there are simple frames (maps and globes) that subtly remove us from literature.I think the casting is masterful. Paltrow has never been so good. She gets more assured as she gets older, but she will never be as committed as she is here. Her cadence in reading the lines is striking -- again, something that seems engineered to transport the words from the page. As with Gwyneth, all the actors might have narrow range (especially Northam), but that range is centered on what is needed.It all works so damned well. It is not as biting an misanthropic as I recall Austen, instead recast as more mildly comic. That's a flaw. But the execution, the eye and the actor's coordination with that eye, really impresses.Note that Ewan came from one great experimental director (Greenaway Pillow Book) before this and went to another (Luhrmann Moulin Rouge) later; these two films are in my top ten of all time. Juliet Stevenson had also worked with Greenaway (Numbers) -- Collette and Walker would also go together to work on his 8 1/2 Women. Scacci had worked with Altman on his greatest film. I believe that McGrath sought out the Greenaway style which also influenced Altman...you can see it here, much toned down of course.

Either you are on a wavelength with this material or you are not. It may be that the majority of my generation, in a lenient time, do not have much to immediately relate to in a movie in which an aristocratic matchmaker spends her days scheming to couple reluctant contenders for marriage. But what is timeless is Emma's personality. I'm sure everybody's met a busybody drama queen who's so sweet and likable, even crush-worthy, but somehow conflict is everywhere apparent when she's around. We don't want to accept that she doesn't really care as much about us as she so convincingly seems to and probably believes she does herself, but instead is just very talented at manufacturing drama that she can appear in the middle of to mediate and make peace with those opposed. How sweet.Gwyneth Paltrow shimmers in this title role, as young Miss Emma Woodhouse, who feels a need to be puppetmaster in her own petite township of England. Paltrow is pitch-perfect as we see her eyes tending the room, deliberating on whose lives she can control, or make better, which is more the way she sees it. She undertakes Harriet Smith, played by Toni Collette, who evokes humble sympathy as an honest young woman of flawed breeding, standing firm that she marry the Rev. Elton, played by the cheerfully foolish Alan Cumming. Miss Smith would much sooner marry a provincial farmer. Emma won't permit it. When the meager cropper sends Miss Smith a letter of proposal. Miss Smith is so unsure of herself that she rejects the farmer, just to find that the Reverend doesn't love her. He loves Emma. This should be a helpful example of the uncontrollable nature of people for Emma, who in her mind feels capable of controlling everyone. But, like most people who live in their head, she'll need more than one.Plots like this are about etiquette, detail and the manner in which genuine personalities strain against the strait-jacket demands of the social order. In an age when transportation was significantly limited and entertainment was predominantly confined to community affairs, three-volume novels and church services, rumors were the favorite leisure activity. Neighborhood personas were precious, as they gave you someone about whom to speculate and judge, and this Austen farce has its allotment, most enjoyably Mrs. Elton (Juliet Stevenson), who commends herself constantly by quoting others.Other community intrigue is supplied by Miss Bates and her deaf mother, Mrs. Bates. They are played by Sophie Thompson and Phyllida Law, who are Emma Thompson's sister and mother, both sharing the great writer-actress' understatedly quirky Brit sense of humor. Miss Bates says everything three times and Mrs. Bates never hears it, and when Emma is disgracefully mean to poor Miss Bates it is the honorable Mr. Knightley, her brother-in-law, in a warm and observant performance by Jeremy Northam, who rakes her over the coals, giving her a hard-line lesson on her moral duties under the class system. Emma views Knightley as a brother. She is not by any means attracted to the Reverend. There is a dapper young bachelor in the community, Ewan McGregor with an essential flirtatious glow, who appears destined to be her squire. However, he has other intentions as well, and in due time Austen sees that everyone gets what they have coming, or for Emma maybe a bit more.The movie tapers the crevice between deftly manipulated social satire and soap opera, but it feeds on a spry intellect and a resilient comic tone. Writer-director Douglas McGrath, who wrote the immaculate Bullets Over Broadway with Woody Allen and moved from Saturday Night Live to Jane Austen with uncanny dexterity, is snug letting the comic features of Austen's work dominate its scholarly heritage. Realizing the broad comic prospects of Emma and the humorous facets of an embellished ceremonial pace, McGrath boasts competently good humor. If this Austen adaptation is ultimately less affecting than, for example, Ang Lee's atmospherically ornate adaptation of Sense and Sensibility, it is more fit to deliver an unexpected sight gag or an audaciously contemporary touch.

The movie respected this subtle irony, not disregarding the comic element (Miss Bates above all). What engaged me in the novel, and the movie renders it clearly, is the deep knowledge of human life shown by the English novelist, and the modern look with which women, men, and their relation are handled, and it is astounding if we think how a woman novelist of the 18th century, who lived almost a secluded life, could grasp such depth and truth about life as she did that most and still fascinates me. We can feel this modernity throughout the movie just replace costumes, and use a more current language but the situations, the feelings, the ideas would be extremely modern. I think of the morbid interest in other people's lives, or that insinuating envy which now as ever rule women's relations, and still the difficulty in revealing, and giving expression to one's feelings, especially love every situation gets a universal and out-of-time value. The cast is really talented and offer very good and extremely brilliant performances a young Gwyneth Paltrow is particularly suitable for this role (nowadays she would be probably too mature for it), Toni Colette is simply great.

Eager to use her talent in arranging things for the people around her, she decides to match the vicar, Mr. Elton (Alan Cummings) with her pretty young friend, Harriet (Toni Collette).The result is a series of mixed signals and mistaken interpretations that end up sorting themselves out, with Emma learning that she did not have as much control over events as she thought.The film is full of Jane Austen's witty and wry characterizations. Gwyneth Paltrow is at her best, portraying this maiden of a restrained, polite society with wit and ease. Her growing romance with the unparalleled Mr. Knightley (Jeremy Northam) is the heart of this film. Mr. Knightley is one of the greatest romantic leading men in films. He is incredibly handsome, in a modest, relaxed way that is irresistible. He is certainly well-matched to Gwyneth Paltrow. Their charming friendship that began when he was 16 and she was an infant, has blossomed as he, a family friend, matches wits with her in an older brotherly fashion that grows into something more. With a wry look or understated jab at Emma, Northam's Knightley is a delight to watch.Other wonderful characterizations include the comic Juliet Stevenson, Greta Scacchi, Ewan McGregor, Polly Walker, and the talkative spinster, Miss Bates, who is very funny.Seeming shorter and more flowing than most Jane Austin adaptations, Emma has comic rhythm that promises true enjoyment. "},{"Title":"Sophisticated Regency Rom-Com","Date":"26 March 2007","Score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Emma was a product of what might be called by the First Great Jane Austen Cycle of the mid-nineties, and it was recently shown on British television, doubtless because of the interest in the author created by the Second Great Jane Austen Cycle which started with Pride and Prejudice two years ago. We currently have in the cinemas the Austen biopic Becoming Jane, and ITV have recently produced three TV movies based on Austen novels. These include Northanger Abbey, the only one of the six major novels not to have been filmed previously, so the cycle should now be complete. No doubt, however, there will be more to come in the near future. (There is, after all, her juvenile Love and Freindship (sic), the short novella Lady Susan, and someone, somewhere, has doubtless supplied endings to her two unfinished fragments The Watsons and Sanditon. Then there are all those Austen sequels churned out by modern writers&#133;&#133;&#133;).The main character is Emma Woodhouse, a young lady from an aristocratic family in Regency England. (Not, as some reviewers have assumed, Victorian England- Austen died before Queen Victoria was even born). Emma is, financially, considerably better off than most Austen heroines such as Elizabeth Bennett or Fanny Price, and has no need to find herself a wealthy husband. Instead, her main preoccupation seems to be finding husbands for her friends. She persuades her friend Harriet to turn down a proposal of marriage from a young farmer, Robert Martin, believing that Harriet should be setting her sights on the ambitious clergyman Mr Elton. This scheme goes disastrously wrong, however, as Elton has no interest in Harriet, but has fallen in love with Emma herself. The speed with which Emma rejects his proposal makes one wonder just why she was so keen to match her friend with a man she regards (with good reason) as an unsuitable marriage partner for herself. This being a Jane Austen plot, Emma turns out to be less of a committed spinster than she seems, and she too finds herself falling in love, leading to further complications.Emma always insists that she will not marry without affection, and when she does find a partner, the handsome Mr Knightley, we feel that this will indeed be an affectionate marriage. It does not, however, seem likely to be a very passionate one (unlike, say, that of Elizabeth Bennett and Mr Darcy). Knightley, who is sixteen years older than Emma (she is 21, he 37), and related to her by marriage, is more like a father-figure than a lover. Much more of a father-figure, in fact, than her actual father, a querulous and selfish old hypochondriac who seems more like her grandfather. When Emma is rude to her unbearably garrulous and tedious friend Miss Bates, it is Knightley who chides her for her lack of manners. (His surname is probably meant to indicate his gentlemanly nature- nineteenth-century gentlemen liked to think of themselves as the modern equivalent of mediaeval knights with their elaborate codes of chivalry). Both Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeremy Northam play their parts very well, but this is not really one of the great screen romances.Of the other characters, I liked Juliet Stephenson's vulgar Mrs Elton and Toni Collette's Harriet. I know that in the novel Harriet was a naïve young teenager, whereas here she is more like the character Collette played in Muriel's Wedding- a gauche, slightly overweight twentysomething, fretting about her chances of finding a man. Nevertheless, I felt that this characterisation worked well in the context of the film and did not detract from Austen's themes.Emma is one of Austen's more light-hearted works, without the darker overtones of Mansfield Park or even Pride and Prejudice, and this is reflected on screen. We see a world of beauty and grace, full of stately homes and elegant costumes and fine manners. Apart from the ruffianly gypsies, who make a very brief appearance, the only poor people we see are Mrs Bates and her daughter, and, as they live in the sort of picturesque rose-strewn thatched cottage which today would change hands for over £500,000, we can be sure that their poverty is relative, not absolute. In Emma's world, poverty is defined as not having your own stately home. This is, of course, not a comprehensive picture of early nineteenth-century life, but nobody has ever claimed Austen as the Regency equivalent of a kitchen-sink realist. Sophisticated romantic comedy, combined with a keen eye for analysing human character, was more in her line.I would not rate this film quite as highly as the 1994 Sense and Sensibility or the recent Pride and Prejudice- it tends to drag a bit in the middle, although it has a strong beginning and strong ending- but it is, in the main, a highly enjoyable Austen adaptation. 7/10 "},{"Title":"great costume drama","Date":"8 November 2003","Score":"6 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  Jane Austen's novel, possibly her best, comes to the screen in yet another version, putting American Gwyneth Paltrow in the lead alongside Jeremy Northam as Mr Knightley.  This is an adaptation which stays true to the original premise as well as giving it a certain cinematic class.  Sophie Thompson gives a good and touching performance as the chattering Miss Bates, and Paltrow manages to keep a convincing English accent throughout.One curious thing is that in the scene where Emma and Knightley dance together has the same music as the dance in the 1990s BBC Pride and Prejudice between Elizabeth and Darcy.  This seems to jar somehow, as though they couldn't find another piece of music!  Perhaps the two adaptations just overlapped.  This 'Emma' compares well with others, but even so there isn't much between this and the TV one done at much the same time with Kate Beckinsale as Emma and Mark Strong as Knightley.

(That sounds bad. Sorry Gwyneth.)And this is a great movie for its writing, and a stiff and imperfect movie for its acting. And for Austen fans (and fans is an understatement for some of them) this is almost awful movie. Awful if you love sublime writing and can't stand to see it so wooden. Paltrow is good. She's pretty. She's appropriately upright. But she insists on delivering her lines. She has them memorized, yes. But she doesn't inhabit the character. And Emma, the character, is one of the best of all literature, filled with sassy individualism and social blindness due to ordinary teenage arrogance. The material is there, and it's a great story (if you like early 19th Century melodramas bordering on soap opera of the highest level). So, it's not a terrible presentation of the movie, but it is, to be sure, a presentation. I honestly think (and don't tremble in rage here) that Alisha Silverstone in Clueless gets the spirit of Emma much closer. There is of course a gap of sensibilities here that I'm ignoring&#x97;a girl in 1995 (Silverstone) is no match for a girl in Austen's time. I'll leave that one vague.About Emma it's worth saying that the sets and costumes are so convincing you don't really think about them. Everything is brightly lit (which I suppose is a reasonable choice, though it flattens the film emotionally as opposed to, say, the Merchant-Ivory approach). The whole spectacle is spread before the camera lovingly, if a bit predictably. In the end it's Austen who wins. The writing, both in the specific dialog and in the general plot outline, are delicate and witty and insightful. Nothing sensational here, just drawing room observation at its best. Kudos for that much, and a reasonable translation to film. It's Austen who wins all those stars.

Northam and Paltrow are a salutory mixture as friends who must pass through jealousies and lies to discover that they love each other.  Good humor is a sustaining virtue which goes a long way towards explaining the accessability of the aged source material (which has been toned down a bit in its harsh scepticism).  I liked the look of the film and how shots were set up, and I thought it didn't rely too much on successions of head shots like most other films of the 80s and 90s do.  Very good results.

However, I was pleasantly surprised and found it much more enjoyable than the Kate Beckinsale version.Gwyneth did a decent job, although I must state that the script portrayed Emma as a terribly spoilt snob, and I rather disliked her in the film and couldn't understand why Mr Knightley would admire her so when really, she was just dreadful. I certainly don't remember finding her so unbearable in the novel.What I love about Jane Austin's work is that her characters are so witty and endearing, despite their faults, but that was not the case in this film. I certainly didn't care for Emma one bit and would have preferred it had the totally bland but sweet Harriet ended up with him instead.Mr Knightley was a far better character in the film; far less critical, more gentle and appealing, and not the stiff, critical bore I found him to be in the novel.

No outstanding qualities, and many flaws, none of them completely horrible. It's certainly watchable, but it's a very shallow experience, so unmemorable as to add to the challenge of writing a review, mere days after watching it.I haven't read the novel, so I don't know if the movie faithfully follows its plot. The setting is the early 19th century, and focuses on the high society of a small town. There, Hariet Smith, is enamoured with a farmer and her friend Emma considers he is not a suitable match for her. So she dedicates a great deal of her time in finding her a better (in her opinion), more high-class fiancé. All the while, several men are revolving around her as well, but she gives them only superficial thought, concentrated as she is on making plans for Harriet.It never really gets further or deeper than that. The inevitable happy end is at once predictable and untimely, falling out of the blue. The acting is too stiff and full of simper, even for a story supposed to happen 200 years ago in the English upper-class. Nor Gwyneth Paltrow, nor any of the actors for that matter, manage to make the viewers relate to the characters. When all the actors give such a bad performance, I suppose the true culprit is director Douglas McGrath.Still, despite all its flaws, there is some charm to be found if one makes the effort to take this piece with a light mind. Perhaps it's the nice English country landscapes. Perhaps the old-fashioned affected language&#x85; Because of this, it's not hard to let yourself carry to the end of this otherwise slightly boring, mostly forgettable movie.

Having not read a single word of Austen's writing, I really can't compare this to any of her work. What I can say is that almost every line of dialog in this is clever, witty, and well-delivered, as well as the biggest source of comedy in this. This made me laugh out loud a lot, with perfect British and verbal material. Every acting performance is spot-on, and Paltrow completely nails the role of a kind matchmaker. The characters are well-written, credible and consistent. I did find a couple of them extremely irritating, however, and while I think that at least some of that was meant to be funny, it tended to get repeated excessively, and it honestly wasn't amusing the first time they appeared. The editing and cinematography are marvelous, and everything looks utterly gorgeous. Plot and pacing are great, you're never bored. It does end in a *really* obvious manner, but maybe that's what the audience of these prefer. I can't claim that this did not entertain me, it did from start to finish, and I'd watch it again.

And while Emma may lack the depth of Persuasion or the richness of Sense and Sensibility, it is nonetheless  a good adaptation of the morality tale of a matchmaker who finds herself out of her league. It is certainly the funniest of the three films!Director/screenwriter Douglas McGrath understands that it is character, not plot, that drives Jane Austen's work, and even the minor characters come to life with vibrance and wit. The cast is excellent. Toni Collete is delightful as Emma's innocently flaky protegee, Harriet. Sophie Thompson is noteworthy as the endlessly talkative Miss Bates, and Denys Hawthorne is a howl as Emma's hypochondriac father.Jeremy Northam has been criticized as being too young and handsome for Mr. Knightly, but in fact Northam was about thirty-five when the film was made, only a few years short of Mr. Knightly's seven and thirty years.  There is certainly enough of an age difference between him and Emma to make their mentor/protegee relationship entirely convincing.  And just because he is older (and wiser) than Emma doesn't mean he should be portrayed as a venerable old geezer.  Indeed, his youthful attractiveness makes Emma's attraction to him all the more believable.Jane Austen once said that in writing Emma she meant to create a character that no one but she would like very much. She couldn't have been more wrong! In spite of (perhaps because of) her failings, Emma emerges as an eminently likeable character.  For all her foolishness and arrogance, she is basically good-hearted, and capable of change and growth.  Playing a flawed but sympathetic character is not easy, but Gwyneth Paltrow brings it off beautifully, tempering Emma's faults with warmth, humor and charm, making her as likeable on screen as she was in print.  I think Jane Austen would have liked her too.

Believing herself to be a gifted matchmaker, Emma sets about meddling in the affairs of various young men and women, all of whom she hopes to steer toward love.Today, Jane Austen's a bit of a feminist icon. Unlike many novelists of her time, she wrote about women's daily lives and concerns, her conception of female morality wasn't limited to chastity or prudishness, she acknowledged female sexual desire and considered women the intellectual equals of men. On the flip-side, Austen's novels at times demonstrate a class bias and are essentially always about man-obsessed socialites, privileged white girls and members of the landed gentry &#x96; the Paris Hiltons and Kim Kardashians of 19th century England.Funnier and brisker than most Jane Austen adaptation's, Emma is buoyed by a fine cast. Toni Collette and Alan Cumming are very good in particular, the former playing an unsophisticated but lovable young woman, the latter playing a church minister who finds himself wedded to an overbearing wife. Jeremy Northan plays Mister George Knightley, a dashing suitor of the type Austen loved to conjure up.

A period costume picture strikes directly at my soft spot, and the overall performance is suitably orchestrated, Paltrow previses her triumph in Shakespeare IN LOVE (1998, 7/10) here she liberates a force of dearness despite of Emma's inbuilt flaws, she is a young lass hobbled in her rustic vantage point, and a fetching soul awaits her prince charm to pay her dues; Northam would also reprise his good-hearted gentleman stature in AN INDEAL HUSBAND (1999, 8/10), a too-perfect and role model with impeachable moral integrity may fall into blandness, but he surely peps up the much-anticipated game-changer with his ear-friendly cadence. Stevenson and Thompson, both inject bountiful comical fodder to the innocuous farce, take no prisoners in their endeavour of mockery with a scintilla of detectable self-awareness. EMMA recapitulates a mostly desired bygone cultural soil where satire and romance are embedded with ostensible proprieties and exquisite garments, a qualified Austen screen adaption indeed, leastwise, it is a lighthearted variant of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, only this time, there is too much pride and not enough prejudice to stir the entanglement. "},{"Title":"Not Truly Accomplished, but Tolerable","Date":"7 February 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" I will say this right away This is not, in my opinion, the best adaptation of Emma... but it is a tolerable one. I thought the tone (which in many cases can make or break a period drama)was pretty good It was light and warm. The pacing is pretty rushed, and I didn't particularly care for the cinematography, but the costumes were pretty and fairly accurate. The settings were appropriately lavish. I did think the lurid pink walls of Hartfield's parlour and the gold and teal tapestries at Randalls were over-the-top, but the music was pleasant and seemed well composed (if not well placed at times.)Initially I had my doubts about Gwyneth Paltrow being cast as Emma, but I did have faith in Jeremy Northam's ability to portray the mature and exceedingly pleasant character of Mr. Knightly. I wasn't entirely disappointed by either. Gwyneth wasn't stellar as Emma. She didn't fit the image of the character because she looked a bit skinny and she should never have her hair pulled tight against her head.The delivery of her lines was sometimes nasal and she often appeared vapid or vaguely mournful. Worst of all, she failed to make Emma likable, which is possible,and indeed necessary. Jeremy Northam was physically perfect for Mr. Knightly. I did think some of his lines were not delivered as they should have been, but that is probably as much the director's fault as his own. Toni Collette, while a good actress I'm sure, was entirely wrong for Harriet Smith. Harriet is short plump and fair, where Toni (with red hair and wearing almost exclusively pink) was tall plump and rosy.Ewan McGregor was dreadfully miscast as Frank Churchill. An actor such as he should never be in period pieces. And he had that same horrid, frizzy red/brown hair that you see on young Ebenezer Scrooge in the George. C Scott version of A Christmas Carol. Now we come to Jane Fairfax, played by Polly Walker who I don't particularly care for in general. Don't think that's the only reason why I would say that she's wrong for Jane though. My issue is that she appears to physically and emotionally strong to play a demure character who spends almost the entire story love-sick. Oh and I may have forgotten to mention this about Polly Walker, but she's Beelzebub. Did you see her smile? In her first scene, that red light around her head was not the sunset. It was the glow of hellfire. Alan Cumming as Mr. Elton was as agreeable as he was supposed to be, but not quite handsome enough, Juliet Stevenson was quite annoying as Mrs. Elton, but I don't think some of her lines were as funny as they were supposed to be. Sophie Thompson's Miss Bates was certainly chatty, but I think she was a bit too young. Lastly, I didn't really care for Greta Scacchi as Miss Taylor, and James Cosmo over-acted Mr. Weston. The story got the important plot points across and apart from the re-location of various moments to sceneries other than those described in the book, there were only two things that I majorly objected to. 1) the portrayal of Mr. Woodhouse. So many of his lines seem critical or harsh. In one of the first scenes, during his Poor Miss Taylor rhetoric, Mr. Woodhouse says how he cannot understand why Miss Taylor would leave her comfortable place with them to raise a family of mewling infants that would bring the risk of disease every time the enter or leave the house. and he says this right in front of one of his TWO daughters. In addition, his eldest daughter has quite a good number of children all of them quite young, of whom he is very fond and is always delighted to see.2) The Archery Scene. This is the part where Mr. Knightly and Emma argue over Harriet's rejection of Robert Martin. This is a pretty intense scene in the book because Mr. Knightly's manner goes from astonished, to indignant to truly vexed. In this movie it begins casual enough, which is good, but it stays casual. Not only that, but when Emma protests that Harriet is a gentleman's daughter, she doesn't seem to be arguing a case so much as complaining. The delivery of the line is high-pitched and insipid, and after she says it she stands there, looking up at Knightly with her mouth hanging open as if there is nothing going on in her head whatever. Then, in her frustration and already shooting poorly Emma's arrow goes wide and into the general direction of Knightly's dogs. As a totally out-of-place comedic moment Knightly says try not to kill my dogs,. My problem with this is that this further mocks the idea that Knightly is really irritated with Emma; and Knightly should have made sure that his dogs weren't sitting behind the targets BEFORE they started shooting.Apart from those issues it's an okay adaptation of the book, but not the best.

Only she is usually wrong in their lives and in her own life.It is possibly one of the funnier Jane Austen movie unless if you include Clueless. This is all about Gwyneth Paltrow. She perfectly embodies the naivety and superiority of her character's attitude. Don't expect some by the book adaptation. They've played up the comedy broadly. The visual style from director Douglas McGrath is rather weak. But Paltrow enlightens the whole movie with an engaging performance. Toni Collette plays the poor Harriet Smith.

But I honestly can't see why this gets so many good reviews.Gwyneth Paltrow spends the movie with pursed lips and an expression like she's smelled something foul. Emma is supposed to be condescending, yes - but she's also supposed to be silly, fun, and devoted to her family. You don't get ANY of that from Paltrow. She's just mean and arrogant. Moreover, you don't get the underlying melancholy subtext about Emma - that she is likely to end up like poor Miss Bates. I must say Paltrow did well with the accent, and only obviously dropped it a couple of times.Sophie Thompson - usually a talented actress - is a total ham and turns Miss Bates into a caricature. She sounds like a stuttering Bugs Bunny.Ewan McGregor is wasted as Frank Churchill; somehow, the director managed to entirely erase his magnetic charm. Alan Cumming is also wasted as a hammy, clownish version of Elton.Toni Collette is terribly miscast as Harriet Smith. Harriet Smith is supposed to be a sweet-tempered, beautiful young idiot. Toni Collette couldn't be described as girlish; worse, she acts like an intelligent and confident woman obviously trying to play the fool.Jane Fairfax doesn't look like a girl of twenty who is the equal in age and background to Emma. Jane Fairfax looks like a sultry older bombshell and acts like it, too.That said, I thought Denys Hawthorne was charming as the hypochondriacal Mr. Woodhouse. And Jeremy Northam was perfect - charming, handsome, and he turned in a brooding and understated performance that was in stark contrast to the rest of the cast.Watch the version starring Romola Garai or even Clueless. Both are much better acted and plotted than this version.

It's a petite, innocent, and simplistic movie that is sure to keep you involved in the story. It features some wonderful dialogue in Jane Austen's novel. It's a nicely composed film, even if the music is not utilized at time as it should be. Gwyneth Paltrow's performance shines like the champagne she drinks in the film, in a breakout role any actress would die for. Paltrow is ever-so-charming as the title character, and puts forth the effort to make this a memorable film and role.Emma is the type of film you'll love watching, it's even appropriate for children, the problem with it is that the fluff is light enough to carry the film into the family genre. There's no depth or artist storytelling, behind the film's green glass, clear water, long candlesticks, opulent furniture, exquisite flowers and classy decor. It does play off some classic fables, but never stomps on any new ground.

I loved the beautiful photo of the typical English dream-idyll the thatched cottages in their tiny gardens, the great mansions, the ball-room dancing, all the beautiful clothes and hairdos... from a time when men were allowed to be men, and women were allowed to be women. There was even a nice vicar and a geese shepherdess in a bonnet to make it complete..! -) Of course one could argue that these people were a small, fortunate minority, who could devote so much of their time and energy to social life, entertaining, match-making and affairs of the heart. In a time when the majority were poor, sometimes very poor, and only seldom could take any time off from their hard labour. One could also argue, that attractive unmarried gentlemen in their most virile age, and with the financial means to keep mistresses or visit prostitutes, probably were not this wholesome and innocent in reality... and probably not all ladies either.But today, on Twelfth Night, I preferred to try to forget about all that, and just enjoy the charming story and the beautiful pictures in the company of my 10-year old daughter! I recommend the movie to girls and women of all ages, and especially those who nourish a dream about Old English Romance..! -) P.S. It was a long time since I read the novel, so I cannot say anything about if the movie was faithful to it or not. I have reviewed the movie as a separate work of art altogether.

For the most part, the acting was good and the sets were decent. Every now and then, a character would appear in a coat or a haircut that seemed out of place for the time period. Paltrow was well-suited for her role as Emma, a nosy but likable matchmaker. The dances performed in the film seemed to be taken from A&E's Pride and Prejudice a year earlier--of course, the time period is relatively the same, but Emma would have been better off not using the exact same dance and musical score.

Jane Austen's novels have always been quite appeasing, but unfortunately the movie doesn't seem to do justice to the novel. After watching Gwyneth Paltrow in The Talented Mr. Ripley and Shakespeare in Love, I did expect the movie to be great. But turns out the other movie by the same name did much more justice to the novel than this one.Though the movie does follow the novel most of the time (I can recall only two scenes that don't exist in the novel), but the way things represent themselves in the novel, the movie hasn't been able to bring the characters to life. Except for the title character on whom the movie (or the novel) is based, the remaining characters have been badly undermined, thus lacking the humor of the novel.Watching movies is my passion as are the books and I often watch movies again, but this one won't be one the list for second watching.

It focuses on all the comedic, light-hearted elements of the story over everything else. Quite a bit had to be cut for time, and the Frank Churchill/Jane Fairfax story suffered the most, I think. Still, most of the cast was good (with some exceptions!) and it's a fun romantic comedy&#x85;even if it's not the best adaptation.I especially love Gwyneth Paltrow's Emma. Jeremy Northam is perhaps a bit too suave but still good as Mr. Knightley. The Eltons and Miss Bates were also great. Unfortunately Toni Collette was awful as Harriet Smith, as were Ewan McGregor as Frank Churchill (hideous wig) and Polly Walker as Jane Fairfax (too robust).This was a fun movie, but not quite Jane Austen's Emma. The Mr. Elton story was given a lot more focus over the Frank Churchill one. I think if I could change just one thing, I'd play up the Frank/Jane story more. Oh, and get rid of the ugly wig as well.

Her actions are all completely misguided and yet there is no doubt that she acts out of love.Emma Woodhouse lives in 19th century England, and according to her creator, Jane Austen, is handsome, clever, and rich. She considers herself an expert matchmaker and spends her days planning elaborate liaisons for her friends. The results are always disastrous, for though Emma is convinced she knows what's best for everyone, she is oblivious of their true wants and desires, as well as her own. Her close friend Mr. Knightley watches with both amusement and dismay, for he can see clearly what Emma cannot. Yet being in love with her tries to guide her as best he can.Emma loves him too, but doesn't realize it until it is almost too late. When she discovers that her close friend Harriet Smith has also developed feelings for Mr. Knightley, and believes that he reciprocates, she suddenly realizes that she doesn't want to lose him. Fortunately for Emma, in the end he declares his true feelings to her and the two marry.So is it an ending that we agree with? Actually it is. We really love the relationship between Emma and the handsome and charming Mr. K - he is unflinchingly honest with her but never cruelly so. We love the scene in the park when he gives her a dressing down for her flippant treatment of poor Miss Bates; it clearly pains him to hurt her and yet he knows that it is the only way to maintain their friendship. And his proposal to her is another one of our favorite moments.Both are attractive and well off, and they share the same social circle. Both are happy people that genuinely care about their family and friends, and they both seem quite content in their little corner of the world. We think that they will have similar views about where and how to live, and how to raise their eventual family.Of course the Knightleys are long gone by now, but we feel quite safe in saying that their union was a happy and long-lasting one, filled with long talks, laughter, plenty of good arguments, and lots of little Knightleys.http//www.reel-couples.com/the-couple-emma-woodhouse-mr-knightley/Reel Thing Rating 5 out of 5 Reels "},{"Title":"Adorable and beautifully done","Date":"10 January 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Jane Austen's book is one of my favourites, and I love this film.

Gwyneth Paltrow plays up Emma's fun-loving nature while maintaining and air of sophistication that is so perfectly Emma. Jeremy Northam is the man who made me fall in love with Austen men! It is no stretch of the imagination to see him as Knightly, and for a lot of the same reason why Paltrow is so good as Emma they both just have a presence that is so perfect for their characters. I don't think a better Miss Bates exists than Sophie Thompson. Alan Cumming has this pert, pious air that, while it makes you want to laugh at Mr. Elton, makes him so perfect for him. Ewan McGregor has that playful, boyish, mischievous look that is just right for Frank Churchill. Juliet Stevenson plays a wonderfully presumptuous Mrs. Elton, rubbing you just the wrong way so that you agree with Knightly Emma chose better for Mr. Elton than he chose for himself.

And I often find that the BBC adaptations just try a little too hard to be faithful to their source material, and maybe the people involved take it too seriously. This film has none of those problems. It's a lovely gem, with Gwyneth Paltrow a perfect Emma and Jeremy Northam a perfect Knightley. This film moves quickly, and the way it skips over some scenes in the novel may irk Austen fans, but this is a lot of fun, charming and witty.

It did however win for Best Musical score.I think all the actors did a great job in their performances. I liked the chemistry between Paltrow (Emma) and Northam (Mr. Knightley). They kept the chemistry restrained in the beginning and kept us guessing as to the true feelings between them. I loved the scene with them underneath the huge and gorgeous tree where they finally reveal their true feelings.One difficulty I had was in following the dialogue. Some of this is no doubt the Austin-esquire speech. I haven't read any of her novels so that put me at a disadvantage in following the unusual dialogue. I was able to get around this by turning on captions and following along that way. One other area that did't particularly appeal to me is that pretty much the whole of the film is dedicated to gossip and matchmaking - the heart of Austin's novel - so I know it was being true to the novel. I just am not particularly engaged by the whole concept. I do realize this was a primary activity in the lives of the upper crust in the 1800's. I just find it a little trivial and trite nowadays. But obviously, this is a period piece and is true to the period.Overall, this is a very well made movie with interesting characters and skilled portrayals by the cast.

The dialogue will be objectionable to attention-deficit post-moderns who like one-liners with no set-up and who have neither the patience nor the cunning to follow a complicated plot. The film has the pace and verbal wit of a play, not an action flick. The cinematography is tasteful and complementary to the dialogue, though, so we should be grateful that this story made it to the screen rather than being relegated to the theater.Gwyneth Paltrow plays a 21 year-old member of the gentry who delights in making matches. Her attempts to find a man for Harriet (Collette) are humorous in a real and subtle way, not screwball. Some might find the plot contrived, but I wanted a happy ending with all loose ends tied up, and I got it!

That movie was very funny and well-written and I have to say this is better written and just as funny.  Gwyneth Paltrow really does a tremendous job as Emma; she really captures her spoiled girl wanting to do good nature.  It is a wonderful performance.  All the performances are excellent really.  Jeremy Northam as Knightly is great as always, Toni Collette playing the shy and nervous Harriet Smith does particularly well with a performance that has to appear nervous.  Sophie Thompson as Miss Bates is fabulous and I really felt for her when Emma insulted her at the picnic.  Mrs. Elton played by Juliet Stevenson is very entertaining in her clueless baseness.  I enjoyed the filming too; a character would begin saying a line in one scene and then the sentence had to be finished somewhere else and so when the scene was finished, we found that the rest of the scene had been done in the other place.  The script is excellent.  Like I said, I haven't read the book, but the screenplay had enough conflict and resolution to please me and to provide some interest to most viewers of this film I would think.  I don't know what Jane Austen would think of the film although I would think that she would be flattered to have her novel adapted.  Nevertheless, the screenplay is very well done.  I have to say that this really was Ms. Paltrow's film. I remember this is around the time that her star really started to glow in Hollywood and I can see why now.

She is better in the role than Kate Beckinsale. But the film suffers from a whole series of poor miscastings and whoever was responsible for the casting can surely not have read the novel. Mark Strong as Mr Knightley in the TV version is  infinitely to be preferred to Jeremy Northam. Mr Knightley is a responsible, serious-minded,  authoritative figure and is described by Jane Austen as having a `downright, decided, commanding sort of manner.', a world away from the light-weight charmer as portrayed by Jeremy Northam, who apart from anything else has not the height or physical presence the role calls for. Ewan MacGregor is also badly miscast in the role of Frank Churchill. He is not only too short for the role but lacks the necessary poise and sophistication.However, the worst piece of miscasting  by far is that of Toni Collette in the role of Harriet; she is too physically large for the role. Jane Austen refers to her as `little Harriet' and describes her as a `humble, grateful little girl'. And I must say Samanthe Morton who took the role in the TV adaption  was absolutely perfect in the part. But the film as a whole was too romanticised and idealistic. I am not willing to believe that people  ever lived like that. Whereas the authenticity of the TV adaption was remarkable. It was like looking through a window into the 19th century.

The difference, I think, is that a dramatic movie (ie one in which action is not a driving force) is, like a play, a platform for conflict. The book is devoid of drama (conflict)--the movie had to fail.The movie also fails because it does not record Austen's ironic intent--the portrayal of a microcosmic world, a cast of tiny characters, and a tininess of intent and significance in whatever the characters do or say.It seems Austen's diaries specifically refer to that irony. Her diaries also refer to the Napoleonic Wars during which Emma is set. These wars go *entirely* unacknowledged.

The rest of the supporting cast is cliché and poorly written as well, earning no high remarks. Even Ewan McGregor fails to impress. Oh, and the script. It makes me cringe. The story and plot is essentially nonexistent, and each scene is entirely too predictable.

She fills her days with light gossip and social engineering (or matchmaking as she would have it). She has been quite successful thus far and conspires to match up the widow Harriet Smith with the rather forceful Reverend Elton. As she attempts to set up this partnership, Emma finds herself losing her touching and messing up the chemistry and confusing the intentions of each. Indeed as she fails in this area, she also finds her own machinations working against her.Not being a big Jane Austen fan I found this rather obvious adaptation quite pleasing and easy to enjoy. I can understand the complaints of those with a love for the material because it is all quite glossy and simple with accessible and obvious comedy and slickness but for what I was looking for this did the job. There isn't a great depth to it but it moves along slickly and presents the material in a manner that is easy to go along with and enjoy like a modern fizzy romance albeit in period dress. Of course this approach has its downside but for my money it made it easy to like even if it left very little in my mind afterwards.The cast help it even if some of them are themselves not helped in return. Paltrow fits the light character in this version and she is mostly responsible for putting the film forward in this way. Those happy with this approach will like her here &#150; I normally don't care for her but she worked for me here. Support is mostly good. Cumming is fun, Northam has a good light touch and Thompson is assured as Miss Bates &#150; being human and slightly irritating at the same time. Collette is better than Paltrow as she brings more than just the superficial. Smaller roles from Scacchi, Cosmo and others all add value. McGrath doesn't have a lot of vision beyond the obvious English touches but at least it all looks like you'd expect it to look.Overall then a fairly light and superficial adaptation but one that is accessible and easy to enjoy as a result. Understandably lacking something for those seeking more than this, it stands as a simple romantic film with good dialogue, a nice fizz to it and plenty of good costumes and sets.

The subtle satire of Austen writings is quite obvious in this adaptation; the music is very nice (by the way, there is the same dancing song from Pride&Prejudice'95 version used here, but with a more vivid tonality),and the fact that many scenes are filmed outdoors, among beautiful scenery, give more poesy to the adaptation.

But Emma is quite good, Gwyneth Paltrow is an excellent actress in her role as the busybody matchmaker interfering in other people's lives and Jeremy Northam is perfectly suited to the role as the brother-in-law and sparring partner with whom, as the audience immediately understands, she will eventually realize she is in love. Why does Hollywood (and the British film industry as well) regularly return to the Austen novels? Because they are well-plotted and lovely little period romances that feature juicy parts for beautiful young girls (Paltrow, Knightley in the most recent Pride and Prejudice and Jennifer Ehle in the earlier TV series that some prefer) and handsome young men (Northam, Matthew Macfayden in the latest and Colin Firth in the earlier Pride and Prejudice). The directors and cameramen are able to revel in the beauty of the English countryside and to produce wonderfully satisfying romances and character studies. Who will be the next Emma or the next Elizabeth Bennet. The next in the Austen canon ought to be filmed in another 7-10 years, so the next leading lady is probably somewhere around 14-17 and already a secure little actress waiting to be discovered.

One difficulty I've had in the past is the world her characters inhabit, a world in which no-one has anything AT ALL to do except sit around and form, dissolve, strengthen or weaken relationships with one another.  Don't get me wrong it's not that I have any moral objection to this as a way of life, but it's a hard way of life to wring a story out of.  When I last read Jane Austen I longed for a touch of Dickensian vigour.But surely this is LESS of a problem in a film, than in a novel?  The cosy world of Emma is just right for a pleasant, warm and for the most part friendly two-hour visit.  There's just enough time to be introduced to the cast and to fall in love with them;  not nearly enough time to be presented with the (to me) appalling prospect of having to live with them.  Besides, in this case a decent story HAS been wrung out of the Jane Austen universe, so I don't see what's left to complain about.Maybe my recollection of Jane Austen is completely wrong, but whether it is or not, the film Emma is just gorgeous, in a way that extends beyond the lovely settings, pleasant score and decent-to-fine performances.

And her class allows her to wile away hours gossiping idly. Back in the day, I found it breezy, clever and surprising enough to watch it several times. As I watch it now for free online, I'm struck by how artless it is. How dull and how long. How unstructured. How on earth can you kill this much time, moving so few plot points so very little? There are almost no dramatic stakes. Paltrow is not talented enough to hang an entire movie on... too much petulance and whining. A viewer tires of her three mannerisms, mere minutes before they tire of the character of Emma herself. And Paltrow has moved on since 1996 to become the world's biggest drag. I can't find in it now, anything I saw in it originally. Alan Cummins is unrecognizable. Northam still represents some type of poised, suave zenith for anything in breeches in Romance films.

Now Sense and Sensibility had this flaw of a slow pace, but at least it had lively lines to make up for it, as well as some good performances!That brings me to flaw #2, which is of course, the acting. While I don't happen to care for basically anybody involved in this film, I am sure they are capable of good work, but I didn't see much of it in this movie. It was like people were trying too hard to be witty, too hard to be upper-class, too hard to be British (well, some of them), so they all just came off as a bunch of actors and not as people.#3. The cast, as I said, seemed only like actors, and not actually like the people they were playing. Maybe that's a good thing, because the people they played really weren't all that nice. Why did everybody like Emma, for example? Sure, she was nice to the rich, handsome people in front of them, but she was an awful gossip behind their backs. If her friends were ugly, then she didn't even bother to go behind their backs. So, why is this girl so great? Why do people have to tell stories, just to make her laugh? Of course the snob couldn't even do that right. I have enough problems with Gwyneth Paltrow as Gwyneth Paltrow, and her Emma did not exactly change my opinion.Well, it's easy to see that I did not care for this one. I'm sure it's a lovely book and all, but some books are really not meant to be made for the big screen, and Emma is one of them.

A talented cast is largely wasted, and among their number I do not include Paltrow, who hardly qualifies as talented on this evidence. Her stilted, mannered, plodding approach to her lines suggests that her energy was sapped by the effort of achieving an appropriate accent. However, this was clearly not a problem a few years later in Shakespeare in Love, and the faults of her performance here merely exemplify those of the production as a whole -- faults for which, one imagines, McGrath is largely to blame, though his Nicholas Nickleby a few years later shows that he too was capable of better. The movie is to be cherished for Juliet Stevenson's marvellous (though sadly truncated) turn as Mrs. Elton, but on the whole the film falls far short of the lively, sensitive, and above all natural, TV version of 2009, in which Christina Cole's Mrs Elton is only one of several outstanding performances.

What we have instead is two versions of Emma that came out within a year of each other. The Gwyneth Paltrow (GP) version and the Kate Beckinsale (KB) version. Both are feature film length with the GP version being approximately five minutes longer. So how did it do? Well the important thing about cramming a five hour story into 1 hour fifty is to know what to leave out and what to keep in obviously. There are several aspects of the story that must be brought to the viewers attention. First is that Emma is a match maker and both the GP and KB versions did this. Second is that Emma takes Harriet Smith under her wing and again both versions managed this. Thirdly that Miss Bates is a bit of a chatterbox and both versions managed this and then there is a divergence. An important part of the story is the arrival of Frank Churchill and his seemingly indifference to Jane Fairfax and his caring for Emma. In the KB version this is accurately portrayed with him seemingly reluctant to call on Miss Bates hence Jane Fairfax and his adverse comments about Jane's complexion and his hints that Jane had a thing for Mr Dixon. However in the GP version it was barely touched on and he did not appear to favour Emma over Jane. For instance he sang with both Emma and Jane and at the picnic he sat by Jane and not Emma whereas in the KB version he only sang with Emma and at box hill he sat with Emma. Another telling divergence is that Harriet Smith's liking for Mr Knightly is not properly shown to us in the GP version. In the KB version at the dance we see Harriet quite clearly being blanked by Mr Elton and then Knightly seeing this and making a point of dancing with Harriet and Harriet's happiness that Mr Knightly did dance with her. In the GP version we saw the blanking but it was not made clear that Knightly then danced with Harriet himself. This is important because it reveals why Harriet thinks that Knightly cares for her. I gave the GP version 7 out of ten because of Sophie Thompsons portrayal of Miss Bates. The scene at box hill when she is insulted by Emma was brilliant. I had a tear in my eye when Miss Bates realised she had been insulted by Emma. So while the GP version of Emma was good in my opinion the KB version is superior because it does bring out the points in the story that need to be brought out.

Paltrow plays the elegantly attractive but misguided young woman sympathetically, her machinations developed in a witty screenplay that gets as much humor as possible out of all the situations that she sets up. She does a much better job here than she did in Shakespeare IN LOVE, a role I personally thought she was unsuitable for--never once convincing in her disguise as a boy.JEREMY NORTHAM is excellent as the man she considers her best male friend and their relationship is developed nicely which leads to a very satisfying ending. All the other performances are excellent, particularly ALAN CUMMING as Mr. Elton, JULIET STEVENSON as the wife he deserves, EWAN McGREGOR (almost unrecognizable in unbecoming wig) as Frank Churchill and SOPHIE THOMPSON (sister of Emma Thompson), who is hilarious as the dim-witted Miss Bates.With an Oscar-winning score by Rachel Portman and excellent color photography, EMMA is beautifully directed by Douglas McGrath, who gets all of the subtle wit and tender humor of the romantic situations in a most enjoyable way.

It is fascinating how blind she is to the needs of others, while so confident when her totally inappropriate machinations result in personal disasters to those concerned. Fortunately, Emma has a long-suffering mentor in Mr. Knightley (Northam), a family friend who patiently reasons with her to explain her grievous errors. If it were not for his influence she would probably not improve or redeem herself and therefor not earn our sympathy. But it is a painful and embarrassing uphill road she travels. The fact that the film is so picture postcard beautiful reinforces how very insular and limited is the view held by Emma . This is, after all, the same England portrayed by Dickens, Eliot, and Hardy. It was not unrelentingly pretty, like Emma seems to think it is. There are some harsh realities of which she is perfectly unaware.Paltrow does quite well as the thoughtless and overconfident feather-head badly needing a comeuppance or a least a good dose of reality. Northam is almost too good as the kindly and virtuous Knightley. Most surprising in the supporting roles is delightful Alan Cumming as the Reverend Elton, who sparkles in the lively and humorous role of one of Emma's first matchmaking misfires.

The movie is pleasant viewing, in the way that cream cakes are pleasant eating, yet it is similar to the unnecessary calories gained in that it is not a must see. Emma is not a movie to take too seriously, even though it raises serious issues. Rather, it is a warm, charming romantic comedy which provides some decent laughs.Emma is part of the recent surge of Jane Austen film adaptations which have as much relevance to today's society as that of the nineteenth century. Not only does Emma centre on the timeless concept of love, it explores serious social issues as well. However, the movie has an underlying value that people should know their place in society and not marry out of their class, which is an outdated value in contemporary society. Where the BBC's version of Emma is historically accurate almost to the point of being dull, McGrath's Emma sacrifices historical accuracy to appeal to modern audiences. Hence the low cut dresses the women wear and the overt sexual attraction between Emma and Mr. Knightley.'The most beautiful thing in the world is a match well made,' is the opening line of Emma, which summarizes the main ideas of the movie. Emma Woodhouse (Gwyneth Paltrow) is a young, upper class woman who is intent on matchmaking. The two most important men in her life are her father (Denys Hawthorne) and Mr. Knightley (Jeremy Northam), her life long friend. Throughout the movie, Emma's unsuccessful matchmaking attempts and other obstacles help her to see the error in her ways and to consequently become a better person. Finally, Emma realizes that Mr. Knightley is, as his name suggests, her knight in shining armour and that they are indeed 'a match well made.' Emma is generally well acted by a cast of experienced actors. Gwyneth Paltrow portrays a likable Emma whose flaws we easily forgive. She sustains a convincing but slightly irritating English accent. At times, Paltrow makes her character of Emma seem unbelievable by over acting. The shining star in the movie is Jeremy Northam as Mr. Knightley. He perfectly blends upper class haughtiness with gentlemanly strength to create a character every female secretly wants to be swept away by, in a way comparable to Colin Firth. Toni Collette brings comedy to her busty, loud character of Harriet. Sophie Thompson and Juliet Stevenson are brilliant at generating laughs as Miss Bates as Mrs. Elton respectively.The overall feel of Emma is one of excessive prettiness and warmth. The settings are very lavish, bringing to attention the lack of historical accuracy. Each shot is so arranged that nearly all of them could have been on the front of postcards, which is hardly necessary or convincing. However, the costumes are superb; the fabulous dresses had me wanting to live in the nineteenth century just to wear them.In conclusion, Emma is a light hearted romantic comedy, which will appeal to mainstream audiences. It is more a feel-good movie than one to leave the audience pondering long after the closing credits. Emma is like a Sunday afternoon (with a cup of tea, dear), which would be the perfect situation to watch it &#150; on a Sunday afternoon, with a cup of tea. Anyone for a cream cake?

If you are a die-hard romantic who melts at a brilliantly delivered proposal of love following a long series of disappointments and heartbreaks, then you must not miss this movie.This film is right up there with Persuasion with Amanda Root and Ciáran Hinds and Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle for excellence in scripting, set design, location, costumes, music and cinematography, and not to forget the eye-soothing dances that made Pride and Prejudice so enjoyable. There are surprises in the cast too which is always welcome. For once Maggie Smith is not anywhere in sight, though I love her. And Judi Dench has mercifully not invaded the celluloid universe of Jane Austen adaptations. Gwyneth Paltrow is a brilliant Emma, if a tiny bit self-conscious a couple of times about her 18th century English accent, which is believable and natural for the most part. Her acting skills make up for any slight blemish anywhere else in her performance. Physically she is perfect. Beautiful, natural-looking and willowy. The only difficulty is believing that a creature like that should not be married to a Duke already.As is turns out she marries a wonderful man, John Knightly, handsomely done, in every sense of the word, by Jeremy Northam. His speech of proposal to Emma at the end is deeply moving and, though I am a muscular manly guy, most of the time, I always find myself wanting to be Emma at this moment. The arc between these two characters, Emma and John, is perfectly written by Austen and enhanced here with the canny direction and camera angles for intimate moments between these two characters. There interaction alone made me certain that Emma is a love story, pure and simple. I don't know exactly what I thought it was before, perhaps just one of the gossipy farces that has a sweet ending. No, this is heavy-hitting Love for those like myself who are In Love at the moment. If you are not on that same page this movie might not impact you in quite the same way.The supporting cast is splendid. Notably Sophie Thompson's Miss Bates, Phyllida Law's Mother Bate's, Polly Walker's demure and elegant Jane Fairfax and Juliet Stevenson's ghastly Mrs Elton. No weak links beyond a shaky scene when Ewan McGregor has to sing an old love song to the accompaniment of a fortepiano. Suffice it to say, he can't sing. And he is a bit glib with some of his lines, sounding decidedly 20th and not 18th century. But his air of breezy caddishness fits the character of the shallow and flip Frank Churchill. Toni Collette steals all of her scenes from everyone else. Her pink and pudgy Miss Smith is adorable and touching. I also greatly loved Greta Scacchi's Mrs Weston, still utterly gorgeous in middle age, and an actress of great range and depth.This Emma would get a 10 were it not for the possible miscasting of McGregor as Frank and a couple of linguistic missteps by Paltrow.

This has served to make many of us forget that she's actually a fine actress, even if her most praise-worthy roles go unnoticed Sylvia, Proof, and here in Emma. She's unfortunately not backed by a stellar cast -- or maybe the problem is not so much with the cast, as all of them have proved themselves to be fine actors in other things -- as with the direction, which never makes the most of the possibilities inherent in Austen's story. The actors don't have a lot of chemistry with one another, and the movie overall feels like a tasteful and dutiful Cliff Notes version of the novel, where plot points are ticked off like a checklist and the whole thing rushes by in a flurry of names and faces. It has none of the cinematic feel that the recent version of Pride and Prejudice had, which was able to make a done-to-death story feel entirely new.Without Paltrow, this movie would be DOA.Grade B- "},{"Title":"Disappointing--even to a non-Jane Austen fan","Date":"4 May 2004","Score":"5 out of 12 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  This was the first Ewan McGregor movie I ever saw outside of Star Wars. Since then I have become a very big Ewan McGregor fan but I still can't bring myself to forgive this movie's existence.My sister has always been a huge Jane Austen fan and because of that, I have been subjected to various of the classics, Emma being one of them. I've always considered them irritating, stupid and boring. However, after watching this terrible rendition, I was forced to admit that the original Emma was delightful and charming. Ewan McGregor scarcely serves a purpose in this film after they hacked and mutilated the part of Frank Churchill. Gweneth Paltrow is ridiculous in an already ridiculous character and the rest of the film is unremarkable and stupid.My recommendation to anybody who is remotely interested in English period drama... go see the originals. If you're a Ewan McGregor fan... believe me, by skipping this film, you haven't missed anything but five minutes collective of him in a silly hat and a bad haircut.

However, there is a time when Emma gets herself in some very bad situations where she gives a girl bad advice and causes this girl to not marry a man she really loves and people begin to turn against Emma. This is a rather long and drawn out film but you just simply have to stay with this film to the very end in order to find out the fate of Emma, Does she become an old maid or someday finds someone who will marry her? "},{"Title":"Mismatch","Date":"16 April 2006","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" One wonders if Emma in its original form could ever be transformed into a successful movie or television version. It is so densely Georgian in its social and historical detail as to be destined on the silver screen to bomb as heavily as Barry Lyndon or Heaven's Gate (not that I am actually comparing it as a film to either of those dreary duds). Where Pride and Prejudice or Mansfield Park, for example, are able to touch a modern film audience because of their internal conflicts involving class consciousness, Emma is better left to the imagination of a devoted Jane Austen fan dozing by the fire on a cold winter's night. It is only when this kind of storyline can be reinterpreted in something contemporary like Clueless that it results in matching Austen's original sense of narrative liveliness, able to be filmed.Gwyneth Paltrow is not in any sense a first-rate actress, but rather a kind of child-like mime -- a lifelong ingénue ironically well-suited to this role or that of other similar tales. That is, she fits nicely into a role demanding a paradoxical combination of youthful innocence and deviousness, exactly what a Mr. Knightly desires in his heart of hearts. Has she ever played anything else? I confess to having little patience to find out, having seen only enough of her work to form a cursory judgment. (Note that I did in fact like her as Emma for that very quality.) Northam may or may not be everyone's idea of the sober Mr. Knightly. But I thought he did a nicely nuanced and professional job of pulling it off. The supporting cast was also adept, as are the remaining cinematic vestiges that display England in its best light in terms of pre-Dickensian literary images.

In my opinion all the movies made from her novels are a bit boring, but I like Austen´s characters, because they all have a certain personality and typical sayings they like to repeat as also in Emma. The thing that makes Emma good is Gwyneth Paltrow, she´s very good in her leading role. Also the fact that each one of the characters in the movie don´t seem to be able to think anything but how to get a good partner and soon married makes the movie hilarious.

I have read and re-read her books at least a couple of times each. And I have in my mind a picture of how the character should look and act according to Austin's books. And it ain't this. In the movie Emma is portrayed by the worst possible actor for this kind of role. If you haven't read the book you will get a really bad idea about Emma Woodhouse. Also Mr.Knightley is not good. First of all he looks too young. He is supposed to be a mature and mentally supperior to everybody else including the main heroine. He is her mentor. But in the movie he look like a young pupy, he looked younger than Emma. Not to mention that he played like it. So with two words bad adaptation of a really wonderful classic book.

This is the right movie for her... too bad she's completely out role. I haven't read the book by Jane Austen, but I can't believe it is so superficial and the characters aren't much more than caricatures. It wasn't probably that easy to reduce in 2 hours of show about 600 pages of the book, but I had expected more than just seeing old pieces of furniture and tea cups. I was taking a sigh of relief every time I saw an actor who didn't overstep the mark of overacting (a couple of times).

I love Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility books and movies, and I'm half way through Mansfield Park. But i couldn't stand Emma. I gave up on the book after 2 chapters, and by the end of the movie i couldn't care less about Emma. She didn't seem to change at all. Maybe it was Paltrows acting (which as excellent in Se7en) or my lack of interest for the movie. Dunno. The costumes are nice, but the dancing was clumsy compared to Pride and Prejudice dancing by Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.I gave it a 2 basically for the fact Knightly is bloody gorgeous, and although it as a rather patchy performance for Ewan McGregor, i liked his singing.

If I had not gone with then my finacee I would have fallen asleep and asked for my money back. I love Gwen Paltrow, but it was like she was on the wrong set. I like most chick flicks, but I hated this one. This is the only time I saw so much clevage and was not turned on. Those outfits were way overdone. No one talks that way anymore and I don't think they even did then. The dancing part was horrible.My ex said to me later...Didn't ya like that part? Didn't ya think it was sensous? I said yes only to spare her feelings. Now I know why we never married.This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

It was a very sweet movie, Gwyneth Paltrow always gives a stellar performance. While it is without a doubt a great movie about romance, friendship, and honor...I found myself thinking I was watching another movie. For the story reminded me a lot of 'Clueless' Starring Alicia Silverstone. Only obvious difference is the time period. Storyline is exactly the same, it even has a few character names being shared, Though 'Clueless' had come out before this movie. This is a great film, I liked it, I am just saying that it matches an earlier, more current time set movie exactly!

She actually appears ALIVE. I like the spontaneity of her performance as Emma. The British accent she uses in this film sounds pretty genuine. She brings not just her character but the whole movie to life. I can honestly say that she's radiant in this film.Also, I liked the fact that in some scenes you get to hear what Emma is thinking. Overall, the film is good...but it's on the boring side. And the British accents did get on my nerves after a while. I kept hoping that a character using an American accent would appear. Nonetheless, it's an enjoyable film. The costumes are terrific, and the art direction is great. If you liked Sense and Sensibility, you'll like this one. "}]
