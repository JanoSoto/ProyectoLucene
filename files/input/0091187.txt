I have to say this is an ideal role for Clint, like Dirty Harry Callahan in the army. I truly love his exaggerated macho-characters because they're so amusing and provide so much fun for a Clint-fan like myself. In here he's a real monster unpitying, blunt, tough and almost sadistic but like most of Eastwood's characters he isn't all that cold, even Sergeant Tom Highway has his sensitive side. In this case he reads women's magazines and tries to reconcile with his ex-wife.Script is filled with obscene language and lots of hilarious, legendary one-liners that kept me laughing pretty hard. Of course I understand why critics don't necessarily like Heartbreak Ridge. We don't have to watch and wait far to find out what the flick is all about, first scene tells it all. This movie is shameless and far from being intelligent but that doesn't mean it's boring. What the hell, it entertains and finally that's what counts.

It makes me miss the 80's, when it was still considered acceptable to be a patriotic American, and movies that glorified America and the military could be made without the felt need to apologize left and right.

Highway begins what may be his last tour of duty and along the way, he deals with a rowdy and undisciplined bunch of recruits (Mario Van Peebles being the most sarcastic and cocky one among the bunch) and turns them into reliable soldiers, Major Powers (Everett McGill), a higher-ranking officer who totally dislikes Highway, and tries to revive his relationship with Aggie (Marsha Mason), his ex-wife who isn't afraid to tell him about the misery that she has suffered.The film runs at a brisk pace and Eastwood saves the best scenes for last when he guides the squad into Grenada to find a medical school where the students (mostly Americans) are held captive and the shootouts are well-done. Plus, the humor in this film is sharp and very witty although some of it may be offensive.Heartbreak Ridge does remind me of the one film that I've seen made by the late Samuel Fuller - The Big Red One. There are a few differences that seem notable, but both films bear a strong resemblance and appeal.

This is mostly a really excellent flick about patriotic values, military camaraderie and old grizzled military veterans. Gunny Highway comes across as the exact fellow you would want covering your ass in any tough situation you could possibly imagine. And Eastwood plays him perfectly with steely resolve, devotion, humor and a healthy touch of irreverence. Its great to see the transformation of Highway's squad, as well as the final moment of judgment for the totally hateful, obnoxious and bureaucratic Maj. Powers. (Oh, if only such b*****ds would get their deserved comeuppance in real life in such a manner, what a beautiful world it would be!)The only real fault is the attempt to compare a minor police action in Grenada with Vietnam and Korea, I guess we're not 0, 1 and 1 anymore. I mean, give me a break, Korea and Vietnam went on for years and killed millions! Grenada involved a couple of hundred casualties over a couple of days. Please! But I suppose in 1986 the American people were desperate for some kind of heroes. Its just that that kind of jingoism would have been much more appropriate after Desert Storm than Grenada. That being said, its still a very good movie with a fundamental message about values, loyalty and comradeship that we could easily have more of these days, besides, Clint is just great!

One particular line that had me in stitches was when he was telling a cadet to put his Kevlar helmet back on by 1900 hours 'or he wouldn't have a head to wear it on'-pure class!!

As a matter of fact, there were plenty of 'laugh-out-loud moments in this film to keep everyone happy-like the smart-ass remarks from the punk cadets.The showdown between Highway and 'The Swede' was highly enjoyable, too.'Heartbrake Ridge' is certainly a lot more lighter and easier to swallow than the similarly-themed 'Full Metal Jacket'.This film certainly passes as perfectly adequate, undemanding popcorn viewing.

To those ends, we will do a fair amount of killing. - Lt. Colonel Ralph Peters The weaker and poorer a country is, the more dangerous it is as an example. If Grenada can succeed in bringing about a better life for its people, some other place that has more resources will eventually ask, 'why not us?' - Chomsky Clint Eastwood stars in and directs Heartbreak Ridge, a dumb propaganda film about US military actions in Grenada. Made with Pentagon support and constructed in the mould of 1950s war films (particularly Take the High Ground and Sands of Iwo Jima), most of which saw tough-guy Sergeants (John Wayne, Richard Whitmark) grooming misfits for war, the film stars Clint Eastwood as Gunnery Sergeant Highway, a no-nonsense warrior who takes a band of delinquents and builds them up into hard-as-nails killers.All the genre's clich√©s are here Highway is the tough daddy disciplinarian whom the group slowly learn to love, his grunts are all rebels and misfits who learn to heroically do their duty, and high ranking military men outside of Highway are presented as being inept goof-balls. As is the case with all these films, the very non-conformity of Highway and his boys &#x96; their supposed dissidence and individuality in the face of state ideology &#x96; disguises/facilitates their absolute conformity.Ridge climaxes with Operation Urgent Fury, the 1983 US invasion of Grenada. Before this the film shamelessly parrots the line of Pentagon spin-doctors. Eastwood and his grunts do not invade the tiny island of Grenada, instead they go to Grenada to rescue US tourists, school kids and students from evil soldiers. One must remember that the official pretext for invading Grenada back in the 1980s was the protection of American lives, specifically 800 students at the US run St George's University of Medicine. In reality none of the students were in danger, none wanted to leave and the invasion was actually designed to oust Maurice Bishop, the people's revolutionary who rallied the islands few thousand inhabitants against Prime Minister Erich Gairy. Within months Bishop had put in place policies which irked Carter and Reagan, who were all at the time busy overthrowing/assassinating similar democratically elected leaders and/or left-wing movements in Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Latin America.Bishop achieved more in a few months than anyone expected, Grenada reaching a 9 percent cumulative growth rate, unemployment dropping from 50 to 14 percent, agriculture diversified, cooperatives developed, imports dropping from 40 to 25 percent as a result of sustainability measures, literacy rates jumping to 98 percent, a free education and health system being established, the number of schools tripling and various industrial programs set in motion.At the time, Grenada's turn-around was praised by the World Bank. But Carter would adopt an adversarial attitude and put in place a program to assassinate Bishop and isolate the tiny Caribbean island. And so the UN Mission in Grenada is bugged, Bishop's party is infiltrated by the CIA, Western media begins to spread propaganda with the aim of discouraging tourists, the CIA begins a destabilisation program and rumours are spread about Soviet submarine, missile and air bases being present on the island. As far as the public is concerned, the tiny island of Grenada is a rouge, terrorist state. When all these rumours are debunked by journalists leading up to the invasion, the major news chains refuse to air retractions. Meanwhile the CIA begins planting bombs at local rallies, inadvertently kills several civilians and sets about trying to weaken the island's economy. This goes on for roughly 4 years.Prior to the invasion, The CIA begins to sew discord in Bishop's Party. Bernard Coard, Bishop's childhood friend and co-revolutionary, begins to break away from Bishop. Coard stages a coup and arrests Bishop, but Bishop is set free by a crowd of some 10,000 Grenadians, all staunch supporters. In response Coard's men apparently massacred Bishop and his closest followers. To this date no one knows where the orders came from and who committed the murders. Coard blames the CIA, the CIA blames Coard. Coard is a free man today. Gairy was given diplomatic immunity in the US. Coard's actions were used as a pretext to invade the island; these plans were drawn up years earlier.To facilitate the invasion the US constructs an unbelievable hoax in which it is stated that the Organizaton of Eastern Caribbean States had asked the US to invade the backwater island in order to protect other Caribbean islands from Grenadian aggression. The invasion takes place, its date of execution designed to distract the public from American casualties and failed US policy in Lebanon (250 US troops dead days earlier). Declassified documents would reveal that US bombing runs systematically targeted Grenadian factories; one of the first targets was a canning plant which helped Grenadians can their own food (rather than relying on foreign companies).The Pentagon claims that weapons of mass destruction were found, which are years later revealed to be rifles manufactured in the 1870s and two Bren guns circa 1950. The US puts in place an interim government, rigged courts and tribunals are set up to assign blame, lawyers and judges are paid hush money, neoliberal polices are put in place to favour foreign investment, state enterprises are given over to foreign private interests and modern consumer capitalism is officially brought to Grenada. In 1991 the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights find that throughout this pantomime the US Government under Carter and Reagan had violated a slew of laws and articles. The report was released when US F16s were bombing Baghdad.4/10 &#x96; Worth one viewing for the always-cool Clint Eastwood. See instead Full Metal Jacket and Cox's Walker.

I don't think I see any scene in this movie that I haven't seen elsewhere. An already quite clearly ageing Eastwood is far too old for the part. He just sleep-walks his way through the role of a grizzled platoon leader, out to whup some misfits into shape. The humour is entirely predictable. The jokes come trudging-up with the inevitability of an old soldier, when they really ought to have faded away. There's the inevitable personal conflicts, a little bit of love-interest in the form of a female bar-keeper, and so on. Even the combat sequences are pretty stagy, with unimaginative location-work.I've watched it two or three times, now. Each time I wonder if I fell asleep or something and missed the good stuff. But not so; it's exactly what it is a completely formulaic military vehicle, but one in which the wheels don't actually fall off; they were never fitted in the first place.Shame on you Clint.

As movies go, it's neither the worst nor the best, rather a repeat of the Eastwardeque formula witnessed in Every Which Way But Loose, only this time in a proud US military tradition.Eastwood comes across as a convincing hard-nosed gunnery sergeant. But the role demands little extra than the Philo Biddo persona - cussing, fighting and generally resisting the rules whenever it suits.However, while Eastwood's role convinces, the other characters are simply cardboard cutout clich√©s - the mouthy recruits, the disappointed ex-wife, the long-suffering confidante, the antagonistic Major. The plot could've been lifted directly from a third instalment of the Every Which Way But... and dropped into Dispersed Pattern Material cammies.There's little in the way of true story progress except that a bunch of spoilt recruits become real soldiers - watch the Granada battle-scenes and make up your own mind if this comes off as a convincing military drama. Highway barely develops as an individual, except to retire. He experiences no epiphany or growth.One could be excused for believing this is a serious attempt at examining the life of a Vietnam veteran in the modernising US Marines, lost somewhere in the past and unable to accept the loss of compatriots on Heartbreak Ridge (of the title), but simply because it doesn't portray the deliberate infantile revenge-plot of movies such as Rambo and Commando; however, Heartbreak Ridge is a poor example of an authentic military story.

Trust me, every clich√©' in the book is used here, from the drunk who finds redemption, to the misfits licked into shape, to the nasty officer who gets his comeupence.

Apart from that, the invasion of Greneda was nothing to be proud of. A tiny little island which never had the slightest chance of fighting back.

When the major reported to the colonel as Graduated from the Naval Academy, 1971 would never happen. The colonel already knows the major's background.Also every Marine knows the Medal of Honor ribbon and every one seeing the Gunny with the ribbon would have immediately recognized that he was a Medal of Honor winner and would have immediately given him the highest respect, including the Major. The Major would have been so glad to have the Gunny in his outfit that he would been kissing his butt.As for the Gunny firing an AK-47 at his troops to get them accustomed to hearing it fire - pure fantasy. He would have been busted out of the Marine Corps if that happened. What he would have done is take his troops to a firing range and under controlled conditions fired the weapon down range. This is done often with units to familiarize them with the sound of enemy weapons.As for the accidental firing on the shooting range, unlikely. By the time a Marine is selected for a recon platoon, he is already highly trained in weapons and he is not likely to make a boot camp mistake.I could go on and on about what a crappy movie this is but enough is enough.

The film's title is a reference to the military campaign during the Korean War where Highway tells one character he went to college, but as we find out later, is where he earned the Medal of Honor.Heartbreak Ridge might be the first film where Eastwood acknowledges his age. Speaking in a gruffer snarl than we have heard from him in previous films, he seems to be settling into the 'wise old grump' personality that he would continue to develop for the rest of his career. Eastwood feels older than ever as he attempts to whip some ridiculously insubordinate Marines into shape before the invasion of Grenada, especially when he says to one of them, Shut your face, hippie! The main problem with the film is that we spend too much time with Highway and the recruits in boot camp. At over two hours in length, the movie might have benefited if it cut out some of the subplots and shenanigans, which take up over half the film and rely on a sense of humor that feels extremely dated over twenty five years later. These scenes might have been more enjoyable if the supporting cast had been at least halfway decent. Instead, we have Mario Van Peebles as the main (i.e. most annoying) comic relief, and a cartoonish villain in the form of Everett McGill playing Eastwood's Commanding Officer. And a subplot involving Highway's ex-wife feels underdeveloped and leaves much to be desired.So where does that leave us, exactly? While this may be THE film about the 1983 U.S. led invasion of Grenada (I can't think of any others), it disappears against a decade full of military training films dealing specifically with a boot camp setting. I promised myself I would not mention the king of this sub-genre that was released a year later, Full Metal Jacket. While Kubrick's film certainly provides some chuckles with the delivery of the drill sergeant's insults, Eastwood's film depends on humor to get it through most of its running time, hardly any of it actually being funny. When it finally does get serious, it does not go all the way, and really ends up only being a film where Eastwood gets to act old and mean around a bunch of younger slobs in 80s attire.

Although now a two time Oscar winning Director, the difference in production values is obvious from this with say Flags of our Fathers. Heartbreak Ridge would had got the nod from Warner Brothers because it would be relatively low budget with Eastwood the highest paid star doubling as director and it shoes in the production values.The film was an oddity for its time. War films were the rage in the mid 1980s but they were introspective as they looking back at Vietnam more critically.Eastwood plays Gunny Highway the tough, no nonsense marine sergeant who has to get his unit back in shape. He also hopes to rekindle romance with his ex wife.Mario Van Peebles plays the cocky black guy who is irritating because that is the way he is written but was designed to attract the urban hip crowd for the time who dug Eddie Murphy films.The film was known for its swearing at the time of its release, this would now be considered to be mild. Its rather hokey, predictable and overlong.The marines comes of age when they have to invade Grenada to rescue some hostages. The action sequences cannot come quick enough. This is a typical Eastwood film for its time where he makes an action picture for the masses but also trying to say something but the message is rather gung ho. Still he had plans to direct Birdy and White Hunter, Black Heart over the next few years, films for critics.

The wordplay is super; the Marines rejected the film because they think like Maj. Powers, i.e. 'politically correct.' Who cares if the scenes were filmed in CA rather than NC? It's an economics lesson. Pendleton is closer to L.A. than Camp LeJune.I particularly liked the way Highway 'picked' on a particular 'uppity' negroid; equally to whites. The film industry is hiring too many blacks when they only form about 12% of the U.S. population. In film and commercials, blacks are portrayed at way more than 12% of the population. Ditzy and horny blonds can have their negroid boyfriends. I'm sure glad I'm old and I don't have to put women in the category of being tarts for blacks for all the wrong reasons.

Eastwood is Lee Marvin, and pretty good at that. Mario Van Peebles, overacting as usual, is John Cassavettes, and a weak one at that. there's a huge guy named Swede that is the Clint Walker of the film. & there's the same situation where Eastwood fights the Swede to prove his formidable strength to his troop; the same thing happens with Lee Marvin and Walker. weakling Boyd Gaines is the skinny equivilant to the neutral George Kennedy. and of course there's the bad guy Lt. played by Everette McGill that is the shadow of Dirty Dozen's Robert Ryan. and there's Eastwood's old war buddy who backs him up and is hard as nails and had wartime expirience with him, this the equivilant to the legendary Ralph Meeker's too-small role in Dozen. okay, okay, enough comparisons already. the surprise here is that i liked the DIRTY COUSIN even better than DOZEN. while it's corny and dated (Mario Van Peebles cannot be more 80s) it's a very entertaining movie from beginning to end. you get a lot of action and a lot of good times, even if the jokes aren't too funny. it's very tuff sitting thru Peebles acting as if he were playing guitar and rapping in a redneck bar (and having fans at that), but it all grows on you, somehow, by the end. and hey, speaking of end - there's a different ending on the DVD. SPOILER in the original that I saw on cable, a character named Profile, played by Tom Villiard, died in the battle at the end in Grenada. but on the DVD this isn't shown. who knows why. and Bo Svenson is wasting in a tiny role playing the guy who Clint's ex wife just kinda likes - leaving room of course for Clint. the romance in the film doesn't slow things down like in some war films (the YOUNG LIONS). and so, all in all, i really liked the movie. for it will not bore you, that i guarentee!!!

At times it was amusing to wait upon what degrading comment would come out of his mouth towards his rebellious recruits or higher ranking officers. Eastwood as the tough, grizzled and razor tongue Sgt. was perfect for the role.Gunnery Sgt. Tom Highway is a highly awarded relic of past wars, but is finding himself constantly in trouble with the law with his boozing ways. He's given one more chance which sees him heading back home to train-up a ramshackle recon platoon, while aggravating superiors and hopefully reuniting with his ex-wife.Very formulaic, but reactionary new breed vs. old dinosaurs format where the times have changed, but when it comes down to it war is war&#x85; where rules and polices count for nothing when you're trying to survive. Back to traditional planning, which makes a difference when you got someone who knows what they're doing? The platoon's attitude at first is rebellious, until Sgt. Highway puts them though the ringer to show what they can achieve and from this they learn to respect him over time because of what he sees in them&#x85; despite what other officials have in mind. Most of the film/or narrative spends with Eastwood clashing with superiors, training/motivating his recruits and trying to rekindle his relationship with his ex by trying to understand her. So after the 90 minute mark, the combat hit's the screen and this is where the recruits are thrown right into it with their yahoos being silenced as what they experience truly humbles them. It opens up their eyes to the fact that war isn't games and heroics but looking after your fellow mates by making the right decisions. The exhilarating gunfire is well implemented, but does lack the punch.Eastwood keeps it nitty-gritty with his economical direction, if maybe a little too long-winded in its length. James Carabatsos's thinly plotted material can play up some comedy elements, but they do fit to what's happening around it. There's also a good commendable cast to boot. Everett McGill as a Major going at loggerheads with Eastwood was a great sight. Mario Van Peebles is quite colourful as one the recruits and Marsha Mason has a lot bite as the ex-flame. There's quite likable support by Eileen Heckart, Arlen Dean Snyder, Boyd Gaines, Tom Villard and a small part for Bo Svenson.

I remember, thinking, Eastwood's voice is at ground-zero, gravely and harsh, but it sure fits the hell into this character Gunnery Sgt. Thomas ' Gunny ' Highway. I watched in amazement, Clint is a dinosaur in this mean-as-nails-Marine film of hard driving male soldiers, who live on the edge. They fight for their country, beer, women, sports and of course the right to play, rock & roll. As the over the top. 'Stitch Jones' (Mario Van Peebles) and his guitar, is a cross between a rock-star and a used car salesman. It was just one of those poetic justice moments for me, when Tom Highway runs into Stitch after being left behind on the gray hound Then there's Aponte, a screwball and Profile, a slacker with a desire to take it easy. Lance Corporal Fragatti, a wise-guy with an attitude of wanting to do the army his way, then Quinones, a friend of all the above, and maybe the biggest of the instigators! The irreverent Everett McGill, as the adversary to Tom Highway, Major Malcolm A Powers, a regimented 'pain in the ass'. Thats right, a regular government mule, standing in the way of the working man's hero Highway. All together through, rain, mud hot 'LZ's' jungle fire fights , hostile terrorists and foreign lands to conquer, in the desert heat, no problem....it's Aggie, that Tom cannot make surrender to him. With, the Swede coming after him and the ever serious (Moses Gunn, as) Staff sergeant Webster they all will have to bend their 'Will' to the Highway. He is a solid old war-horse that keeps on going till it's all done doing.The action was fun, the cast of wild-dogs and misfits is a perfect fit and this is another very well crafted Clint-flick, that works for me any day.

To my friends there, I hoarsed out that the government of Grenada was now illegitimate, that it was open season for anyone to liberate Grenada, and to get on the phone to Sen. Ted Stevens' foreign affairs staffer and ask him to tell Ted that we could turn the Cold War completely around if we acted militarily FAST.I am sure it wasn't just me thinking this. In any case, staffers reputedly brought the decision to act militarily to President Reagan on the golf course, and after a few moments ... in the tradition of Teddy Roosevelt ... he said YES, and Operation Urgent Fury was launched. (Granted, Maggie Thatcher's Commonwealth feathers were ruffled and *she* was furious, but President Reagan brought her around with his great Irish charm.) And our liberation of Grenada was indeed the boots on the ground military turning point of the Cold War, leading to our - and everyone's - Cold War victory *without* a World War 3.What people have forgotten is that just before, our Marine barracks in Beirut Lebanon had been suicide-bombed and in that post-Vietnam era, our national morale was rock-bottom. On 1Sep83, there had also been the Red Air Force's ... unanswered ... massacre of Korean Air Lines flight 007, which had flown over Sakhalin Island - maybe unintentionally, maybe not, but nonetheless ....Seldom have a nation's feelings ... and actions ... transformed so quickly as ours did with our Grenada operation.Clint Eastwood's depiction of the Marine Corps and that military operation may be in some ways flawed, but nonetheless is an excellent depiction of all this and the of Marine Corps community's ready response.For veterans like myself - Army draftee, Stateside and West Germany, 67-69 - it can be enjoyably funny. It was the first time I had ever heard the phrase cluster f**k. We might keep in mind, though, how we reacted when Russia threatened our inner national security zone, when we criticize Russia's reaction to our own machinations within *its* inner national security zone today in Ukraine.

All these things would be acceptable in an outright comedy film but the problem is that the comedy is so broad that it undermines the apparent seriousness of the rest of the film.Gunny's potty mouth runs rampant in these scenes and the film would have been improved by some reining in of this. Less is definitely more when it comes to obscenity. Fortunately he is more verbally restrained during his attempt to rekindle a romance with his ex, the film's 2nd strand. This part has quite a different tone, that of a romantic melodrama. It's OK, but not memorable.A third strand emerges about 20 minutes from the end. Like Police Academy the recruits must be tested in battle, to show that Highway's unorthodox (and probably illegal, for good reason) methods have really be more effective than the rule book. But whereas in Police Academy the tone remains light, here everything suddenly darkens. The enemy is shown being gunned down, corpses are strewn around and one is even shot at point blank range by Gunny.Then, one of the recruits is killed- maybe. I say maybe because someone says don't let him be dead Gunny and Gunny replies it's not up to me. This is then never mentioned again and the apparent death of one of their pals does not dampen the celebratory mood.I do think this film would have better if those involved had decided what genre they were making. Is it meant to be a broad comedy or a serious film with comedy interludes? A less lazy script and tighter editing would have helped. As it is, it is more Humdrum Hill than Heartbreak Ridge.

The movie sends a win with yourself message without being sappy . Actually it's one of the funniest movies I have seen. A great war comedy. There are many one liners and situations that are worth mentioning , but I just don't have time to write them all. My favorite is the joke with the waitress at the beginning of the movie and the t-shirts. There is some action in the last 30 minutes of the movie.It's fun to see how Eastwood's character interacts with his recruits and other people . Clint really fits the role of old fashioned soldier . It's good to see a REAL man in the leading role &#x96; something which is so rare in today movies. I also have to mention Mario Van Peebles as the adorable hippie rock singer Stitch. It's strange he didn't made a big career . He's charming and talented. Marsha Mason is lovely as Aggie.The movie is lighthearted fun , yet it wants the audience to respect the veterans , because nobody who wasn't at war can't really understand them . They are too often unappreciated and subject of jokes and attacks from society . No , this is not a pro-military movie . Even if it is considering how many anti-army and anti-war movies were made this one is a refreshing change . It's unpretentious fun , people , just like Top gun . It was made mostly to make the Americans feel better , but the amount of USA patriotism here is small , so everyone can enjoy it . Don't look for meaning of live and enjoy it .I give it 8/10.

One thing that people may not know about this movie is that it first was going to be about the Army and not the Marines. Clint's band of misfits were supposed to be Army Rangers. When Clint approached the Army for assistance they didn't want any part of it. The Army's Be All You Can Be image may get tattered. So Clint approached the Marines and they were glad to help him with his movie. I believe in the movie the Sergeant Major is in the bar looking at old pictures and telling the corporal about Heart Break Ridge and mention was made about he and Clint being in this battle as Army soldiers before they joined the USMC. In the Marines they have special units of Recon and Force Recon that are similar to Army Ranger and Army Special Forces units. So it became a Recon unit for the story. In real life it was the Rangers who freed the medical students at the campus from the Cuban soldiers. So this is why Clint tried to enlist the Army's help. With the current world climate today I am sure the Army would help Clint make his movie today. Anyway it was a good action movie with comic relief and a few different story lines working together at one time. Worth the rent.

I first saw it in the cinema upon it's theatrical release and have since worn out my VHS copy which I later replaced with the DVD. I even watch it when it's on TV.I am not a person that is prone to having heroes or being a 'fan' of celebrities but Clint Eastwood is about as close as I come to having a hero of the big screen. Clint has a quality about him that even though as an actor he can seem wooden or awkward at times he has that gleam in his eye that allows him to carry of comedy with some aplomb. He is the comedy opposite of Jim Carrey.In Heartbreak Ridge his character Gunney Highway has a real chemistry with Mario Van Peebles 'Stich Jones' from the moment they encounter each other on the bus. Highway is a gruff old-style marine gunnery sargeant with a gravel voice who chews nails but has a strong sense of responsibility and cares greatly about his men in the Recon platoon.This is shown when he first appears to the men under his command. they are a rag-tag bunch who are not fit to be called marines. The Major in charge only cares about his beloved 1st Platoon and lets discipline go to pot just so 1st platoon can use Recon platoon as whipping boys in training. Highway stops Recon platoon from lounging around and makes them train hard. He explains to the Major that if Recon are not properly trained they just get dead.Cue the training comedy antics and personal drama with Highways branching plot line involving his ex-wife. It's all done in a fun way with rivalry developing between 1st Platoon, the Major and their drill sargeant and Highway and the Recon platoon once the Recon platoon realise their self-worth.This all eventually leads up to the conflict in Grenada in which Highway and Recon platoon Kick butt. There is some sadness with the death of one of the platoon members in combat and Highways romantic involvement is finally resolved.It's not a brilliant film but is the type of character driven films that can suffer repeated watching which is more that can be said about some of the critically acclaimed high art or films with a twist ending that can only be watched once as it is spoilt once you know the ending.Heartbreak Ridge's ending might be obvious but it is the journey there that makes it worthwhile.

This is another entertaining film that enhances the rugged, gruff, and yet romantic personality of Clint Eastwood. Profanity and action with a twist of comedy and romance has won me over with another favorite that Clint Eastwood accomplishes as he directs and portrays Gunnery Sergeant Thomas Highway. Favorites of the movie were the non stop comments. Foul mouthed but yet full of whit, which always seemed appropriate for the situation. Improvise, adapt and overcome is one of my favorite lines that Highway uses. Gunny Highway uses this in his techniques of training through out the film. There is an episode when the troops were on a hike and Gunny maneuvers him self behind the troops. He begins open fire and displays that death is at the feet of the platoons. The lesson was to survive by improvising, adapting and overcoming the situation. The troops thought Gunny was one crazy bastard. Over a period of time, and training they learned to expect the unexpected, adapt to all situations and overcome what is given to them. The troops learned the survival techniques which are needed to overcome the enemy.

Nobody who hasn't been through what Clint's character has been through can understand him. His officers are morons -- one sadistic goon from supply and a mousy new lieutenant who brags about his ROTC in college. It take the whole movie for Clint to show them how the cow ate the cabbage. The plot is positively hoary. Patton had the same job. So did Gregory Peck in Twelve O'Clock High and John Wayne in too many movies to list. It's always enjoyable to see a rough, tough man's man walk into his new command and rip everybody a new one.It's kind of amusing too in its own flamboyantly retrograde way. You ought to hear Gunny insult his men by calling them ladies and muttering that, though he may have just done them a favor, that doesn't mean they're going to swap spit in the shower.There's a bit of combat at the end, in Granada, which we invaded in order to save the sons and daughters of wealthy Americans attending an offshore medical school in St. George. Not to worry though. One man is killed but he's quickly brushed over. And the men go into battle with bullets zinging around them while exchanging the usual wisecracks and sometimes whooping with joy. It's not meant to be a serious depiction of life in the Marine Corps -- I hope -- but rather a cassation that reassures and numbs the mind at the same time. It would have gone over quite well with the teens at the drive-in. They could have rolled around in the back seats and fogged up the windows while Clint and his wife, Marsha Mason, had the kinds of arguments about family versus job that John Wayne suffered through so often.It was shot at Camp Pendleton in California and in Puerto Rico. It's almost an insult to the Marine Corps. The men in the platoon have let their hair grow out and some wear earrings. They dress and act like slobs. They openly insult their sergeant, who is a Medal of Honor winner, and threaten to do him physical injury. It was tougher than that in the Coast Guard. I mean it. Sure, in boot camp the Swedish maids were young, radiant, and eager to please but the Swedish language does not have a word for medium rare so we had breakfast in bed with steaks that were invariably overdone. On the other hand I taught night school for some years at Camp Lejeune and the students, admittedly a select group, were as sharp and responsible as any that I've taught anywhere, and smarter than most. The Marines I knew would have looked at this the way you and I might look at Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Kind of amusing but in no way meant as more than a cartoon fantasy.

The man is the master of macho and can make the Sahara desert look cool. Unfortunately he isn't perfect and despite directing and starring in this outing doesn't save it from being average at best and just plain bad at its worst. Heartbreak Ridge advertises itself like a war movie but in fact is 90% tough as nails 'teacher' takes a band of unruly 'students' and turns them around and 10% action on an island somewhere. Eastwood growls and grumbles his way through the movie as awkward young marines try to test him. The problem is that the young crew really don't fit into the story. They look like they belong in Dangerous Minds (similar story but very different setting) rather than the Marines. A half hearted attempt to put romance to the film has Eastwood trying to get back together with his ex-wife. Unfortunately the chemistry between everyone in the film is little to none making this barely passable as entertainment. Certainly most of the entertainment comes in the last half hour as team finally mobilizes and goes to war on the island of Grenada.In case I haven't mentioned it twenty times Clint Eastwood directs and stars in the film. There isn't anything wrong with his character, in fact he has quite a bit of depth but he's also not incredibly likable rubbing everyone the wrong way from his ex-wife to his higher ups. It just isn't one of his best roles and far from his strongest. Mario Van Peebles is one of the oddest inclusions in this film. While he has a fun character in Stitch, the character makes little sense being in this film. However, Van Peebles and Eastwood actually have some bizarre chemistry that works. Marsha Mason plays Eastwood's estranged ex-wife and unfortunately for her (multi-Oscar nominated actress) her character is barely existent. She is vapid and forced into the story to have some romance and soften Eastwood's character. Arlen Dean Snyder is Eastwood's friend and partner. You certainly get a sense of history between Eastwood and Snyder but they don't explore it any. Snyder is some sort of weak comedy relief. Boyd Gaines is the cocky strong arming Lieutenant that fights Eastwood at every turn and is destined to get shown up in the end.The biggest problem with Heartbreak Ridge is simply that it drags. You expect them to go to battle but it seems like they will never make it. There is also never a pinnacle turning point when Eastwood breaks through to his team and makes them respect him. Instead it just seems he beats them into submission and suddenly they will follow him anywhere. Writer James Carabatsos is a former Vietnam vet but clearly that doesn't necessarily translate to a good film even with a powerhouse director and star. I'm still surprised Eastwood would choose to direct this given the script and plot is just simply not good. It tries to carry itself as dark comedy and a war movie but it never lands in either campy. Overall as much as I love Clint Eastwood I would never choose to sit through Heartbreak Ridge. Every direction it goes with the exception of the last half hour in battle just isn't fun to watch and will leave you wondering when it will all be over. 5/10 "},{"Title":"Heartbreak Ridge a musical comedy about&#133;.

When a large, mean-looking guy comes up and says derogatory things about Marines, Eastwood gives it right back to him. When the mean guy tries to beat him up, he is subdued in a couple of seconds, then Eastwood goes right back to his stories. He plays Sergeant Thomas Highway, a by-the-book, no-nonsense platoon leader who received a medal of honor many years earlier, in a battle few even knew about, at Heartbreak Ridge. But now he sometimes drinks too much, gets in fights, and is getting close to the mandatory retirement age. (He was actually about 55 during filming, and looked real good.) So most of the movie is about Highway getting re-assigned to his former post and put in charge of a rag-tag platoon of men who were lazy, disrespectful, and hardly ready for possible battle. Which he does quite admirably. Lots of funny stuff in there also, and many great one-liners. Also, Highway's former wife, Marsha Mason as Aggie, still lived and worked in the community as a bar hop so they could rekindle their animosity towards each other. I really like this movie, even though I waited almost 25 years to finally see it. After getting his men in shape, they were called to assist in a raid on Grenada, to recover a group of American students being held there. They turned out to become the heroes of the fictional invasion. There really was a 1983 invasion of Granada, to safeguard Americans living there during a coup.

I was in the Navy for 6 years and spent 4 of them on a helicopter carrier that ferried 2000 Marines around (just like the one they used late in the movie), so I got to know what they were like.Which brings me to my problems with the movie - The lack of respect for GySgt. Highway's Medal of Honor. First of all, a CO in Maj. Powers' position would have thanked God and BuPers (Bureau of Personnel) for sending such a highly decorated NCO to work under him. Yes, he had his run-ins with the law, and he did deck Powers' buddy during his last tour at Lejeune, but the respect for the MOH would have been evident. Powers NEVER saluted Highway first, as custom dictates. Also, his troops would have been scared to death to tick off such a decorated NCO, who are almost God-like in their stature in the Corps.- The total lack of discipline of Highway's men. Never would have happened. The squad bay looking like it did, the Marines in civilian clothes during duty hours? No way, dude. They wouldn't have been playing pool in the barracks. Thy would have been out training. Plus, they would have had their hair high and tight long before Highway's arrival. And the rebellion fueled by the Swede's return. Pure fantasy, although the fight between Swede and Highway was cool. Highway's attitude - on Swede starting to become a Marine - was pretty good.- Lt. Ring. A necessary foil in a movie such as this, but totally unrealistic. Yes, ROTC officers aren't always as gung ho as Academy officers, but they aren't THAT clueless. Asking him what college he went to? I wouldn't want him leading my unit.There are other minor things that bother me about the movie, but but I still watch this movie whenever it is on because - plain and simple - it's Clint, and Clint's the man.

The story is absolute nothing....an American Marine-officer who lives for the army must train a bunch of useless t**ts who are just caring about rap music and girls...and you get it, Eastwood makes it possible to train them as an elite-platoon who were of crucial sense in the Grenada-war. The film lasts 130 minutes and not once there is a sense of criticism even if the soldiers (and even Eastwood himself) are humiliated in the worst way there is. The whole movie the soldiers are complaining that they have to do some sports but once the call is there for war, you see them carrying the stars and stripes. Yeah, pacifists will have no one good word for it, be sure of it. But as said just like if you are considering to throw this film in the bin you are facing the strong performance from Eastwood who must play his most coolest performance ever!

He's put in charge of a group of undisciplined recon marines and his personal objective is to whip them into shape at any cost. Though this isn't one of the best military movies ever made, Eastwood's ability to play a good tough guy makes this film. There are a few things that keep it from being a great film. Some of the supporting cast aren't top caliber and come across a little hard to take seriously. And probably the one thing that bothers me the most is Eastwood's repeatedly verbally reminding us that a marine is supposed to Adapt, Improvise, Overcome. He must have uttered those words a half dozen times throughout the movie. I think more than twice is overkill and the constant reminder made it a little less meaningful. He does have some good lines and plays the part well. Though cliche, I enjoyed his I-Don't-Give-A-Rat's-Ass-About-The-Rules attitude when dealing with his inexperienced superiors. He was going to do what he thought best.

The dullness of the movie is minimally relieved by some essential spark that shows through the barrage of stereotypes of people and scenes.  The scenario of gunnery sergeant breaking down the troops is done with a compelling rawness to it in contrast with (for example) the same work in An Officer and a Gentleman.  Eastwood's character is close to an unwanted but mandatory retirement, and this adds an engaging undercurrent throughout the movie.Most of the other stereotypes are similarly leavened of their tedium by some originality, but only enough to barely keep us awake. These include 1. Tough warrior clueless about his woman. 2. Men go into battle and miraculously enemy fire seems to miss them even when they are in the open in front of enemy guns. 3. Tough-man warrior-repartee from Eastwood. 4. Tough experienced warrior in conflict with paper-pusher from military academy.If you notice how much I use the word tough here, it is forced into every part of the movie in typical Eastwood fare.  There is no sense of vulnerability to his character nor intimacy in his relationships with men or women, only his overwhelming need to keep up his pretense of being more than a man while giving less.  That said, there is no denying that he gives a convincing portrait of an aging warrior who has looked Hell in the face and outfaced it.Even the movie's ending is contrived and make-shift, but somehow it is done with a deftness of minimality that combined with Eastwood's character's looming retirement makes the ending acceptable.It is in these contradictions that the movie lives and manages to be watchable without being much fun to watch.

Not even in the Dirty Harry films is Clint Eastwood more the Clint Eastwood the movie-going public loves.In this one Clint is a Marine Corps lifer who has come back to his original Fleet Marine unit to train a really ragged bunch of gyrenes who have an attitude. And as we learn had previously been in the care of another lifer who was coasting towards his retirement.Coasting is not in the Eastwood creed, it's not something he ever did in any film he was in. Halfway during the film we learn that he was the winner of the Congressional Medal of Honor back in Vietnam. But that fact has probably kept him from being busted out of the Corps because Eastwood can be pretty nasty and insolent, even to superior officers.The guy he's assigned to, Everett McGill, has a grudge going into the new assignment. Eastwood slugged a superior officer who was a friend of McGill's, an old classmate from Annapolis.Clint's also got a domestic situation, an ex-wife in the person of Marsha Mason. She's working and keeping company with a redneck bar owner, Bo Svenson. I loved Mason's scenes with Eastwood in Heartbreak Ridge, they remind a whole lot of the way John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara behaved in their best pictures.Clint's the man in Heartbreak Ridge. Whether it's Marine Corps regulations, Marine Corps training, Marine Corps politics, the man lives his creed, he overcomes, he improvises he adapts, but always in his own way.Director Eastwood selected a really good supporting cast besides those already mentioned. Really good in their parts are Arlen Dean Snyder as Eastwood's best friend the sergeant-major on the post, Eileen Heckart as the widow of another of Eastwood's Marine Corps friends and his landlady as well and Mario Van Peebles the 'ayatollah of rock and roller'.One part I really liked, my favorite in the supporting cast is that of Boyd Gaines as the young lieutenant who is in charge of Eastwood's platoon. Most people would remember Gaines from his role in the later years of One Day at a Time as Valerie Bertinelli's husband, but I think this should be his career role. He's a callow youth who grows up under pressure and even as an officer comes under Eastwood's tutelage. I like the way he stood up to Everett McGill's browbeating when McGill was trying to throw the book at Clint. Character can be brought out in a lot of ways.The climax of the film is the United States invasion of Grenada to both overthrow a Marxist stooge of Castro and rescue American civilians stranded during an uprising. It was nice to see Eastwood and the rest of our fighting force get the welcome they deserved for a nasty job, well done.And Heartbreak Ridge is a nearly perfect Clint Eastwood, that deserves a well done.

If people recall any military affairs of the Reagan White House they most likely recall the Iran - Contra Affair (and it's star turn by Col. Oliver North) or the tragedy of the Marine Barracks suicide bomb in Lebanon. Granada was a brief event - almost a stunt. But it did bring back a modicum of respect to the military, even if there were some snickering about the rescue of vacationers by the armed forces (it was the rescuing of American students, by the way, at a Granadian medical school). After the Vietnam War, the U.S. was shying away from large scale troop commitments and conflicts for awhile. But in Gerald Ford's administration we had a bloody victory recapturing the Mayaguez from Vietnamese sailors, and in Jimmy Carter's we had the botched rescue attempt in 1980 to get the Iranian Hostages home. Granada was clearly better handled than those two events.There is some irony in Granada. The events actually put the Reagan Administration into a position of avenging a man who openly hated it. President Bishop of Granada was a Communist and wished to turn Granada leftward. He openly condemned Reagan. Unfortunately there are always fissures even in totalitarian movements. Bishop was moving too slowly for some others. He was killed in a coup by elements of the Granadian military who Castro was supporting. The fact that Americans were in Granada drew us into the matter. The Americans were rescued, and by our efforts Castro's allies were defeated (and the murdered Bishop avenged!).HEARTBREAK RIDGE was made three years later (1986), directed by it's star Clint Eastwood. While not among his greatest films which were to come in the next twenty years, it is a good production. He is a tough Marine who dislikes authority. He has risen to the rank of Sergeant, particularly through his war record (it turns out that he was one of three survivors of a grueling war fight along a small ridge - hence the title - that earned him a Congressional Medal of Honor). But his career has never gone as far as it can, and he is facing the end of it either in retirement or in court-martial due to his frequent drunken escapades or scrapes with the brass. He is given his last chance shaping up the worst bunch of misfits in the Marines base. At the same time Eastwood has married and divorced former military gal Marsha Mason. At first the marriage seemed working but Mason got fed up that whenever Eastwood had an opportunity to retire on his first rate combat record he resigned up to go to another action or war. They have been divorced for some time, and as he is approaching the end of the military road Eastwood wants to reunite with Mason. But she is hard to his advances (although she is apparently interested enough in his welfare). The culmination is when they almost seemed reconciled, but she sees through his soft approach (You flanked me!, she accuses him), and she throws him out. Later, after a night in the local jail for drunkenness she bails him out and tells him they can't continue unless he respects her terms.The misfits in Eastwood's platoon include Mario Van Peebles, Tom Villard, Ramon Franco, and Mike Gomez. We watch as here Eastwood manages to bring these different misfits (Van Peebles thinks he's a potential musical entertainer) together. This despite the heated rivalry of another platoon, whose sergeant outranks Eastwood. It culminates in a victory of Eastwood and his men over the others in a war maneuver game (including a slug match Eastwood has with the Sergeant - Major). Finally comes the actual combat in Granada, and how Eastwood and his men acquit themselves proudly in it.Besides the others, note Moses Gunn as a sycophantic sergeant who is in the command of Eastwood's rival. He's a real piece of work.The film actually works. This is ironic as Granada is (in retrospect) a slight affair of our history - a footnote. The one film of note made of it was a worthy and watchable war film. In comparison the one movie (made in it's period) about Vietnam (THE GREEN BERETS) was a wash-out. One had to wait until after Vietnam was receding into historic nightmare that films like THE DEERHUNTER and APOCALYPSE NOW (and even FORREST GUMP) came along to show what was that war like. For all that made Granada forgettable to Americans, HEARTBREAK RIDGE manages to capture the story quite well.

I am a 34 year member of the military having duty in both the Air Force and the Army and have been in combat. I have watched Heartbreak Ridge many times and continue to be impressed with how closely it mirrors military life. The only unrealistic theme is the open disrespect that Gunny Profile has for Major Powers. In the real corps no sergeant would do this no matter what his opinion might be, at least not in public. Nonetheless most scenes ring true to my experiences in the military. As I near the end of my military career and am looking at my last deployment in the next month or so, I am beginning to experience some of the same emotional conflicts so accurately portrayed by Mr. Eastwood.As comparison, the two 1986 military movies receiving more acclaim, Top Gun and Platoon, were much less realistic. Top Gun was a rousing good story, but as a flight surgeon with many pilot friends who agree, it was moderately unrealistic. Fighter pilots can have their wild moments but not in their aircraft. They are highly trained professionals engaged in extremely dangerous but necessary activities. A moment's inattention will end in disaster and they know it. Platoon is a complete flight of fancy with absolutely no relationship to reality, but then it was never meant to be realistic. It was a war protest movie made by people who have continuously demonstrated their contempt and hate for all things military that was intended only to degrade the military. It isn't worth watching. The only worse military movie than Platoon that I am aware of is The Thin Red Line which, in the attempt to denigrate American soldiers who fought in the South Pacific, actually was incredibly insulting to Japanese soldiers who frequently fought to the last man and NEVER groveled for mercy as the movie maker wants us to believe.

Instead, go to Heartbreak Ridge. You might ask if it will have the same kind of action, since one is Grenada (where it took all of about a day or two, give or take a few minutes) and the other is Vietnam (which, you know the story). Doesn't really matter, since it all comes down to taste and execution. Perhaps if you're a hardcore John Wayne fan you'll dig that piece of military propaganda, but even casual Clint Eastwood fans will find something enjoyable about Heartbreak Ridge, which embraces the Marines while also taking a good long snap at bureaucratic BS and people who get in the way of someone who is perpetually a hard-ass who gets everything right in his place. Or, to put it another way, Ridge provides us with the Dirty Harry of the Marine corp, which is enough to make it something interesting on its own.Why the comparison anyway? Because they're two examples of gung-ho military Americana made for the masses. But, and this is the biggest but, Eastwood is the more confident filmmaker and star, and with his film as a star vehicle as well as straightforward Recon-man-whips-men-into-shape-for-battle story he takes charge with plenty of good, witty lines and a sense of camaraderie with the male characters. Hightower is Eastwood's character, someone who must have been somewhat easy to play but also a lot of fun, the only real conflict for him coming in trying to recconect with his former girl (Mason) and in rubbing up against the even harder-ass Major. Around Hightower are a cast of near-classic misfits and complainers- chief among them the Ayatollah of Rock-and-rolla played with total glee by Mario Van Peebles in one of his best roles- and off they go in getting ready for a battle which takes place so quickly it fits just neatly (and awesomely) enough into the last half hour of the film.It's a given to see much of Eastwood's style as no nonsense. The most we get from Eastwood trying to show-off as it were would be a tracking shot following two guys, or maybe a close-up or too. It's so unfussy that one almost wishes Eastwood might try something that might POP off the screen or give the final battle something to chew on. But it is what it is and it's great to see it that way, since the technique doesn't change what's already worth while in the script. While the story itself isn't without a couple of flaws- the romantic relationship subplot doesn't really work well past the hey, we have problems that go way back... and it starts to get better just because it's convenient to the plot deal- anything with Eastwood barking and quipping lines at and with his men, just some of Eastwood's classic facial expressions we know and have seen many times, make Heartbreak Ridge a fine achievement for him.It's not as devastating a portrait of the marines as say Full Metal Jacket or Jarhead, but it doesn't need to be. For Eastwood this is a chance to make a Clint Eastwood picture out of the marine corp, and it's very entertaining to see him do when it's at its best. And, unlike the Green Berets, it doesn't paint *way* unrealistically what it's like to go into the LZ. In fact, there may be a few watching who might want to join up just because someone like Clint may be a Recon leader. Crazy to say? Just watch.

He's a battle hardened and decorated veteran from the Korean and Vietnam war who will have to train his new unit. But that unit isn't exactly what you expect from a platoon of Marines. They are all lazy and more interested in style, music, drinking and in chasing women, than in training for combat missions, let alone in fighting the enemy. But Highway isn't just the average drill sergeant either and he'll teach them what it is to be a real marine, something that will be very useful when they have to go to Grenada, where they will have to rescue the American citizens and fight the Cubans. In the meantime he also tries to reconnect with his ex-wife, who still sees him as a gun-ho, who has always been more interested in the army than in her...What you'll see is the typical Clint Eastwood like we know from the Dirty Harry-movies.

I like 'Heartbreak Ridge' for its simple approach to the humanity of each Marine and that in a hot LZ, there's still nothing like having an old vet who knows the ropes.The military never has enough 'Gunny Highway's' to pave the road for the next generation of soldier who finds him or herself in harm's way.As far as the accuracy? The movie could almost be called a work of fiction except that we did go to the island of Grenada and we did liberate those students.I recommend this flick to those who can logically separate the politician from the soldier and understand that warriors have no say over when or where they fight. They dedicate their lives to their country and land upon any shore, anywhere at any time because they are patriots....

Moses Gunn was also well-cast as Sgt. Webster, Highway's rival. Eileen Heckart was very good as Little Mary Jackson, the bartender at the local bar favored by marines. Arlen Dean Snyder was fun as Choozoo, Highway's old war buddy. Boyd Gaines was enjoyable as Lt. Ring, the wimpy leader of recon platoon. Marsha Mason was decent as Aggie, Highway's old love.

Thomas Highway seems to find himself in constant trouble both with military superiors and civil law. But he is also a highly decorated war veteran and generally the meanest, toughest ... you can find around. As a last chance before retirement he is assigned to a run down platoon of Recon Marines. His task is, against their will, put the platoon into shape and combat efficiency (and lead them in the invasion of Grenada). At the same time he prepares for retirement and life outside the military, not an easy task for a career soldier.Comments Most of it is a mean and tough Eastwood, fighting hiss will through with sheer determination and muscle. Not too much depth and introspection, but still very entertaining and his style fits the movie very well.So, what you get is a lot of determination, testosterone, muscle, guns and at the end a little history in the invasion of Grenada. There is the subplot of his attempts to adapt to a civilian life, mostly by trying to get his ex-wife back. It has definitely a role to fill but is a minor on. Highway, and the movie, is still very much military. Don't expect anything else, or you will be disappointed.Eastwood dominates this movie very much, both in acting and directing. There is total focus on his character and it is only Mario van Peebles with his wannabe rocker Corporal Jones that get sufficient screen time to really do an impression. van Peebles to me, rarely is the mark of a quality movie, but here he is very good for this character Stitch Jones. But both he and Highway is very one-dimensional and would benefit from some depth.However, with the movie running over two hours I can't see how there would be room for any such development. It was probably a very wise decision by director Eastwood to cut most of that. The result is a very entertaining (yes very gung-ho - but that can be entertaining) military and war movie, set in a little unusual time (not WWII or Vietnam).7/10 "},{"Title":"You been freeze-dried or doin' hard time?","Date":"24 May 2008","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Drama","Review":" The poignant opening frames, accompanied by a drum roll, which show black and white footage of soldiers from the forgotten meatgrinder that preceded Vietnam&#151;the Korean War&#151;fade into a scene in a big city jail, where Marine Gunnery Sgt.

And of course there's the heavy combat towards the end of the film.I did enjoy the film, but did not take it too seriously. The reason I didn't is because Heartbreak Ridge runs into problems when it comes to realism. As others have said, recon units are elite units with members who hold themselves to the highest standards at all times. Members of recon units are not the shoddy, lazy, poorly disciplined men seen in this film. They are consummate professionals, and would have undergone so much training and weeding out to make the accidental firing on the range unbelievable, as well as the general undisciplined behavior of the unit at the beginning.

The story is absolute nothing....an American Marine-officer who lives for the army must train a bunch of useless t**ts who are just caring about rapmusic and girls...and you get it, Eastwood makes it possible to train them as an elite-platoon who were of crucial sense in the Grenada-war. The film lasts 130 minutes and not once there is a sense of criticism even if the soldiers (and even Eastwood himself) are humilated in the worst way there is. The whole movie the soldiers are complaining that they have to do some sports but once the call is there for war, you see them carrying the stars and stripes. Yeah, pacifists will have no one good word for it, be sure of it. But as said just like if you are considering to throw this film in the bin you are facing the strong performance from Eastwood who must play his most coolest performance ever! The man with the iron face is full with scars from battles he fought (he was a hero in all the big wars) and he comes over as the most dangerous killing machine ever, even Dirty Harry would run for his life!

Van Peebles' character is so dated in the early-to-mid 80's that he is painful to watch at times.  (Peebles does a good job, it's the character that makes one wince.)  Being the real thing, it is bad-retro, not good-retro.  (How soon we forget!)There are also elements that will appear to the present-day viewer to be cliche.

Those are just a few of the dozens of lame utterances coming from Van Peeble's mouth. He never shuts up. All were uttered in the heat of battle and you just wanted him to get shot. Then, he fires about 200 rounds in a med. school dorm and a beautiful blonde steps out of the shower and drops her towel. Can we say gratuitous nudity? Then, there's the fight between old man Eastwood and a recruit who is 6'7 and 300 lb. of solid muscle. Eastwood dispatches him as if he were a 5 year old girl. How?

Basically Sergeant Thomas Highway (Clint Eastwood) is a hard, tough veteran of Korea and Vietnam back in the United States Marine Corps, and he is assigned to train a reckon unit. These young soldiers look like a bunch of rookies, and Highway met one of them, Corporal 'Stitch' Jones (Jaws The Revenge's Mario Van Peebles), so as Gunnary Sergeant he is going to be pretty tough. Highway gives strict discipline, forcing the soldiers to wear the same top as him, get up very early in the morning, go through gruelling drills and exercises, and they are sick of it. The recruits slowly go up a gear in their training, so Highway does slowly grow in confidence that they can go to war in a real battle, and eventually they do. While Highway tries to rekindle something with waitress Aggie (Marsha Mason), he and his now real soldiers fight against the enemy on the beaches of Grenada, and they come back triumphant. Also starring Everett McGill as Major Malcolm A.

You won't mind the first training half, and the second half with loads of guns blazing and an explosion or two is alright, it isn't a very inventive film, but it's not a bad war drama.

Heartbreak Ridge amazed me the first time I saw it, and it just keeps getting better.Gunny Highway is the most interesting of the many great misfit tough-guy characters Clint Eastwood has brought to the screen. Tom Highway grows and changes in the course of this film, challenging inner demons more daunting and dangerous than anything either the Cuban Army or the U.S. Naval Academy can throw at him. The viewer does not know until the end if he will master them or not -- and maybe not even then, because the character really doesn't know, either -- but he has decided to give himself wholeheartedly to the effort, just as he had done as a kid on Heartbreak Ridge. When he studies a Cosmo advice column like a captured enemy battle plan (been there, done that), I laugh to hide my tears. Even when one has seen the ending (many times), it does not lessen the suspense and anxiety that lead up to it.I give it a 9 rather than a 10 because all the characters first appear as two-dimensional types, coming to life only as the story unfolds. Maybe this was intentional, to hasten the story. Maybe this reflects the nature of first impressions. In any case it is just a minor annoyance, one that becomes less obtrusive after the first viewing.

Tom 'Gunny' Highway (or drill Sargent for those not familiar with Marine talk). If I am not mistaken one of the other drill Sargent's is played by a real drill Sargent.Gunny is brought in to train a group of of marines who lack a certain amount of military discipline. He quickly starts to work on them. Treating them with sadistic cruelty. But we have also see other sides of Gunny too, such as the drunken brawler who is arrested for urinated on a police car and a guy who reads women's magazines so he can get back with his ex-wife.OK, so we know that this bunch of losers will do good in the end. The characters are both interesting but also Cyphers for a bigger message. Gunny is perhaps too much of a hard-ass, the marines shout too much (all the US Marines I have met in real life are very quietly spoken and polite...and have skinny legs...a result of the badly designed marine workout program), the Mayjor is too much of a idiot to really have been transferred from supply to commanding an active unit and so on. I also don't think a recon unit would have ever had such bad discipline, as they should be the best of the Marines.Full of a lot of witty dialogue played with a straight face, military situation humour (such as the need of credit cards on the battle field), gay jokes (funny, but was not acceptable in the politically correct days of the 1980s, but more acceptable in the post south park era) and so on.The message ultimately is that soldiers are not people who love war, nor is their behaviour an acceptable part of modern civilized society, but they exist to serve the greater society. There are other messages here too, but ultimately for most people these messages get lost.Still one of my favourite movies.
