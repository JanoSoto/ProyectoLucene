When I came back home, I went to see it again. Keep in mind, I was twelve, but at that time it was the coolest movie ever. I even collected the ultra-rare action figures (I have them all except for the Bowler, which is the hardest to find. They made Mr. Furious, The Shoveler, The Blue Raja, The Spleen and Captain Amazing, in case your wondering. There IS a William H. Macy action figure in existence!). I've watched it many times over the years and it still remains a favorite of mine, due mostly to fond childhood memories. It's not a perfect movie, but it definitely deserves another look and perhaps a cult following.The story a bunch of low-level superheroes save the day. This was executed again in the mediocre, direct-to-video The Specials as well. But this is the other end of the spectrum big budget (huge budget, almost $100 Million I think) studio comedy. Yes, the effects are overblown and the huge sets and wonderful production design are a bit much considering the plot. But don't think this as a stupid, special effects-y superhero movie--it's a PARODY. They fight a villain named Cassanova Frankenstein, people. He has a psychofrakulator, whatever that is (it's a doomsday device, he'll take over the world, yada yada.) And resident superhero Captain Amazing (a Zapp Brannigan-esque Greg Kinnear, with commercial-product-logos on his costume, nice touch) is kidnapped. Time for the Mystery Men Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller, gets mad), The Shoveller (William H. Macy, beats people with shovels), The Blue Raja (Hank Azaria, British, throws forks), The Bowler (Janeane Garafolo, bowls), Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell, guess what he does), The Spleen (the great Paul Reubens, farts), and The Sphinx (Wes Studi, cuts guns in half with his mind, I am not kidding). The rest of the fantastic cast of character actors includes Geoffrey Rush as Cassanova, Lena Olin heavily edited out as Cassanova's bride, and the one and only Tom Waits as a crazy weapons dealer. So...with Macy, Kinnear, Olin, and Rush there are four Oscar-nominees (and one winner) and Tom freakin' Waits! It's not perfect though. It's overlong and there are some gushes of corniness here and there (The Shoveller's full of them).The dialogue definitely outweighs the physical comedy, which is sometimes lacking (there's a guy who farts for his power, case closed). The dialogue is definitely a highlight, the cyclical ramblings of the Sphinx, the mixed metaphors of Mr. Furious, etc. It's downright a funny movie, (it will almost make you forget that this was the film that let All Star by Smashmouth out into the world.) Unfortunately, the film did not do as well with critics and audiences as it should have. A sequel was originally planned (the film is in fact based on a comic book and characters from The Flaming Carrot comics. The Flaming Carrot was planned for the sequel I believe) but this did not do well at the box office. It could have been a hard sell, a superhero comedy with the guy from There's Something About Mary. It also could have been the fact that it was released on the same day as The Sixth Sense--which ended up being the biggest hit for the month of August--as well as The Thomas Crown Affair. Two other misunderstood classics were released on the same crowded weekend, oddly enough--Dick and The Iron Giant. Critics gave MM passable reviews, but it was quickly forgotten. Sadly enough, on Comedy Central's Roast of Jerry Stiller, comedian Jeffrey Ross commented to Ben Stiller that, I saw 'Mystery Men' and I fired MY agent. Ben is then seen to mouth the words, I should have to. Don't listen to him. Give Mystery Men a chance.

Claire Forlani deserves particular note as the object of Mr. Furious's desires. There's a boatload of talent here.

I mean, there hasn't been a good superhero movie out for quite some time (NOTE Batman Forever was NOT a good superhero movie).  I really wanted this film to be good, and unlike most of my recent trips to the cinema (read Blair Witch Project) I wasn't disappointed.Mystery Men was definitely not a high-effects, tension-filled action flick, it was a comedy.  And on that basis, it was a success.  It had everyone in the small theater laughing, and got applause and laughs right through the final scene.  Stiller and Garofolo are hilarious together, as always, and Azaria adds just the right touch of craziness.  William H. Macy plays a great straight man, while Kel Mitchell and the fart-powered Paul Rubens are added just to keep the kiddies happy.Though the sets are bizarre (and at times seem like ripoffs from both Batman and Blade Runner), and some of the jokes are obvious, it is still just plain funny.  There are some lines that will catch even the most jaded viewer off-guard, and bring tears from the belly-laughers among us.I definitely recommend this movie.  Although not an all-time classic, it is twice as funny as the latest Austin Powers retread.  The writing is good, and the cast is GREAT.  If you're worried, plan on the matinee and pay less, but either way you'll be pleasantly surprised.  I mean, who among us doesn't root for the losers once in a while?

When an evil villain, Casanova Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush) is released from a mental institution, captures the local superhero, Captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear), and threatens to take over Champion City, three wanna-be superheroes, Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller), The Shoveler (William H. Macy) and The Blue Raja (Hank Azaria) come to the rescue.  Frankenstein has been joined by a myriad assortment of underworld scum, however, and has become a formidable opponent.  The trio realize that help is needed, and decide to recruit; what they end up with is nothing less than the most unforgettable team of `superheroes' ever assembled in the history of the cinema.  Mr. Furious has his rage; The Shoveler, his shovel; The Blue Raja flings silverware (mainly forks, and the occasional spoon, but never a knife); the Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell) can turn invisible as long as no one is watching; the Sphinx (Wes Studi), a heavy hitter from down south, is very mysterious and can break guns in half with his mind.  Maybe; the Bowler (Janeane Garofalo) can fling a ball with deadly accuracy; and The Spleen (Paul Reubens) wields flatulence that can incapacitate an entire room.   	This is a brilliant ensemble piece that delivers the laughs without ever becoming condescending or patronizing the audience, while playing it straight at all times.  The dialogue is witty, and the performances given by Stiller, Macy, Azaria and Garofalo are exemplary.  There is a number of memorable, hilarious scenes, especially the one in which they throw a pool party and barbecue to recruit, and conduct interviews with a stupefying assemblage of applicants; and another, in a bar, when the Bowler has a conversation with her long-dead father, whose skull has been implanted in her bowling ball.  The funniest of all, however, has to be when the team actually attempts to rescue Captain Amazing.  But these are only examples, for the entire movie is composed of one hilarious scene after another, laced with subtle humor that will keep you laughing and thinking about it for a long time.  The real secret of it's success, though, is that Usher keeps it all real; the relationships between the characters are true, and the whole concept of being a `Superhero' is played as being entirely reasonable, which somehow gives a sense of credibility to the entire proceedings.  In this world, the aspirations of Mr. Furious and the rest are tenable, and Usher keeps the laughs coming without ever resorting to slapstick or mere sight gags. 	The solid supporting cast includes Lena Olin (Dr. Annabel Leek), Eddie Izzard (Tony P.), Tom Waits (Doc Heller), Claire Forlani (Monica), Louise Lasser (The Blue Raja's mother), Jenifer Lewis (Lucille) and Pras (Tony C.).  `Mystery Men' is a truly inspired movie that can be seen over and over again, with a new chuckle to be had with every viewing, guaranteed.  In the immortal words of the Sphinx, `We are number one!  All others are number two, or lower.'  Is it an Oscar-worthy movie?  Hardly; but for a good time and a lot of laughs, treat yourself to this masterwork of comedy; it's the real deal, and you won't regret it.  I rate this one 10/10.

Be that as it may, MM is a terrific comedy and affectionate spoof of comic book movies, much like GALAXY QUEST spoofed sci-fi flicks. Ben Stiller shines as an inept superhero with anger management issues who leads a group of equally inept superheroes played by shovel-wielding William H. Macy and fork-tossing Hank Azaria (I kid you not). They add some new members in the course of the movie, played by Janine Garofalo, Paul Reubens, Wes Studi and Kel (of Keenan and Kel fame), in order to face down an army of bad guys headed up by the always delightful Geoffrey Rush. The plot is virtually identical to X-MEN, which came out the following year. I think this movie does better by the plot, which is your basic let's-save-the-world scenario. Some money was clearly expended on this under-appreciated enterprise. It shows in the costumes, the sets and the CGI. Garofalo, who came late to the project, is absolutely hysterical as a lass armed with a bowling ball containing the skull of her late and hardly lamented dad, who evidently converses with her although we never hear his side of the conversation. The movie will make no sense to those with no exposure to comic books or superhero movies. For everyone else, it is a gem. Watch out for some patchy editing in the final showdown.

Mystery Men spoofs several aspects of superhero movies like Superman or Batman, such as the pithy sayings, and the questions about secret identities.  Most of the superheroes aren't billionaires like Bruce Wayne, but blue-collar types with menial jobs and neurotic home lives.  So it looks as if director Kinka Usher is making the heroes into something the average viewer can relate to.  I found Mystery Men to be visually stimulating and very funny.

Also, a little of Hank Azaria's Blue Raja can go a long way.  Still, it's easy to forgive all of these faults when you have a film which is this much fun.  All the actors seem to be having a blast with their roles, especially William H. Macy as the straight-arrow Shoveler, and Janeane Garofalo as The Bowler.

Dark humor, downright silliness, bona fide action, and even a touching moment or two, combine to make this comic fantasy about lovable losers a true winner. The comedic talents of the actors playing the Mystery Men -- including one Mystery Woman -- are a perfect foil for Wes Studi as what can only be described as a bargain-basement Yoda, and Geoffrey Rush as one of the most off-the-wall (and bizarrely charming) villains ever to walk off the pages of a Dark Horse comic book and onto the big screen.

They drove ME barmy for the first ten minutes or so.  But after that I made a kind of a truce with the terrible cinematography; and long before the end of the film, I had ceased to care.  This is too rich a comedy to be destroyed so easily.  It's hilarious, it's witty, the comic delivery of ALL of the cast is flawless, and however much Usher peers at his characters through a cold, fish-eye lens - HE may not care for them much - he manages to present them with warmth.  `Mystery Men' is, in fact, not only funnier, not only more clever, but also deeper, than anyone seems to have given it credit for being.  The jokes in the Austin Powers movies, for instance, as well as being less funny than the jokes here, are also much more toothless.  The satire of `Mystery Men' bites when there's something worth biting and gnaws gently when there isn't.  It doesn't mock just any old thing.  Which is why, contrary to what some (I must regard them as unobservant) critics have said, it never runs out of ideas.The `super' heroes are an attractive bunch.  Sure, they're second-rate, but they're not merely second rate.  The Blue Rajah, for instance, does nothing but throw cutlery at people, and he isn't THAT good at it.  On the other hand, neither is he comically bad.  He's better in his limited field than most people, and he DOES practise diligently.  He's not a buffoon, which makes him a much funnier character than if he was.  If Superman is Christ in a cape, the Mystery Men are all the minor demigods from the foothills of Mount Olympus, in capes.  Much funnier; also much more endearing.

Simply put, the Mystery Men are a group of sub-Heroes desperately trying to live out their adolescent fantasy lives while botching both their real identities and their super identities.  The Shoveller (Bill Macy) works construction during the day, and at night, leaves his wife and kids at home while he cruises the street looking for crimes to tackle with his extraordinary and unique Shovel-fighting style. The Blue Raja (Hank Azaria) sells silverware to newlyweds by day and flings tableware at crackpot villians by night, if his mom isn't keeping him busy with the latest snooping.  Mr. Furious works in a junk yard to earn his pay, then takes out his frustration on his friends at night, tossing ill-conceived one-liners at friend and foe alike and threatening to get really angry (leaving everyone to wonder, So What?).  Ben Stiller breathes such life into this character, you can't help but love him.These three spend their nights trying to capture that 'moment of glory' they've dreamed about... becoming real Super Heroes.  Obviously, it could happen.  Champion City has Captain Amazing, after all... a flying, fighting super-cop with enough corporate logos on his costume to stop an extra bullet or two.  Greg Kinnear turns in a stellar performance as a middle-aged sellout trying to recapture his fans attention in the twilight of his career.To bring back that 'extra magic' that might win the endorsements again, C.A. frees Casanova Frankenstein, a WAAAAAY over-the-top menace played to chilling perfection by Goeffrey Rush.  This lunatic genius has created a 'psychofrakulator' to warp Champion City into a reflection of his own insanities... and ends up capturing C.A. within hours of his release from prison.  This leaves only the Mystery Men to stop Frankenstein's evil plan, but with such henchmen as the Disco Boys protecting Frankenstein, the trio are going to need a little help.Recruiting commences, and after a painful recruitment party, the team settles in with The Bowler (Janeane Garofolo), who initially has the only real talent in the team, with her mystic bowling ball seemingly animated by the vengeful spirit of her dead father;  the Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell), who CLAIMS to turn invisible when ABSOLUTELY NO ONE is looking at him; the Spleen (Paul Reubens), granted mystically powerful flatulence by an angry gypsy;  and the much underused Sphinx (Wes Studi), who is shown to be able to cut guns in half with his mind, then spends much of the rest of the movie spouting inane riddles and acting over-wise.This film really is a cross-genre romp.  Anyone wanting to pigeon-hole films into neat little categories is fighting a losing battle.  This is a spoof/parody of the superhero genre - from the pseudo-Burton sets recycled endlessly (and occasionally decorated with more spoof material) to the ridiculous costumes, the comic-book genre gets a pretty good send-up.  But at the same time, it is a serious superhero flick, as well.  Both at once. While not a necessarily unique idea in itself (for example, this movie is in some ways reflective of D.C. Comic's short-lived Inferior Five work), it is fairly innovative for the big screen.  It offers the comic-book world that requires a suspension of disbelief to accept anyway, then throws in the inevitable wanna-bes - and we all know, if superheroes were real, so would these guys be real.  If the Big Guy with the S were flying around New York City, you'd see a half-dozen news reports about idiots in underwear getting their butts kicked on a regular basis.  Sure, the Shoveller fights pretty well, and the Blue Raja hurls forks with great accuracy - all parts of the super-hero world.  But does that make them genuine super-heroes?  Only in their minds.This movie is also a comedy, albeit a dark one.  Inevitable, when trying to point out the patent ridiculous nature of super-heroics.  One-liners fly as the comic geniuses on stage throw out numerous bits to play off of. Particularly marvelous is the dialogue by Janeane Garofalo with her bowling ball/father.  Yet, it isn't a comedy in the sense of side-splitting laughter or eternally memorable jokes.  It mixes in a dose of drama, of discovery and of romance, but never really ventures fully into any of it.What really makes Mystery Men a good film, in the end, is that it is very engaging.  The weak/lame good guys are eventually justified and, for one shining moment, really become super-heroes;  justice is served;  and the movie ends with a scene that reeks of realism (as much realism as is possible in a world where bowling balls fly and glasses make the perfect disguise).  If the viewer stops trying to label the film, then the film can be a great romp.Of course, no movie is perfect.  Claire Forlani comes off as bored and directionless as Mr. Furious' love interest, in spite of having a pivotal role as his conscience.  Tom Waits seems somehow confused by his own lines as the mad inventor Dr. Heller, although his opening scenes picking up retired ladies in the nursing home is worth watching alone.  And the villians are never more than gun-toting lackeys (a point of which is made in the film).  The cinematography is choppy and disjointed (such as happens in the average comic book, so it is excusable), the music sometimes overpowers the scenery, and the special effects are never quite integrated into the rest very well.Yet, overall, this film is incredible.  You probably have to be a fan of comics and the superhero genre to really appreciate this movie, but it's a fun romp and a good way to kill a couple of hours and let your brain rest.8/10 in my opinion.

Back in those days, comedies meant something. And they're remembered even now in certain quarters. This film is brilliant because it not only provides an insurmountable amount of laughs and fun concepts, it also show how people as a whole truly can be. This is said because the movie showed through examples of goofy pseudo-superheroes that people are who they are and just have to work that to their advantages. Mushy sentiment aside, the film starts off by showing a trio of superheroes in Champion City (an overt, if functioning title for a city) trying to fight but losing. With yet another defeat tallied up and a substantially important city personage missing, the three superheroes decide to recruit some newer members to their fold and fight off the fiend who started this mess. As luck would have it, it all seems to go awry, until they enlist the help of a big-time superhero as well as a deranged scientist (played to the hilt by the great Tom Waits) who offers them weapons. It then remains on our newfound heroes to fight the villain and save more than the city. All in all, an excellent film for all with limited cursing, little or no sexual humour, and just a wee bit (bad pun) of toilet humour.

My favorite was the Blue Rajah (played by Hank Azaria). The fact that he dressed in green and tossed spoons (not even forks or knives) at the beginning of the film AND lived with his mother made him a hoot.

A good cast, some quirky dialog, and a director who knows when to just let his cast have a good time all add up to a fun time.Mystery Men is not a genre flick in the usual sense, nor is it a Ben Stiller vehicle. It is more like The Mask except it relies on the ensemble instead of a central star. This has likely contributed to the movie's relative obscurity, and the broad dislike by a number of its viewers. You have to be willing to geek out a bit, and watch a goofy comedic ensemble at work to appreciate Mystery Men.That said, a few things do not work. The love story between Ben Stiller's self conscious hero and Claire Forlani's waitress simply doesn't seem to play. Kel Mitchel is simply adequate, and though I find him hilarious, it's hard to separate the scatological (or methalogical, if you prefer) The Spleem from Paul Reuben's personal life.All in all, our motley team of untalented superheros play delightfully off of each other, and entertain more than they bore.

It's filled with so many quotable lines that will leave you in tears and it's jokes hit their mark 90% of the time.Geoffrey Rush as Casanova Frankenstein (an awesome name) is the coolest character, with his absurd accent and strange lifestyle. When he hosts the party with all of the appropriately-named gangs, the results are priceless.

The Sphinx is OK, you don't really need him, but he's fun (there's a scene with a watermelon that's a keeper). Kel Mitchell and Paul Rubens as The Invisible Boy and The Spleen are great, especially Ruben's slurring accent (Schup? I'm the Schpleen). And even though I don't like Janeane Garofalo and I hate Greg Kinnear, they both were great in here too. Sarcasm and condescension at its best! The special effects are decent for the movie's modest budget. The effects look very cartoony and colorful, but that's how they should look in this kind of movie. Heller's non-lethal weapons are a really cool idea, especially the Canned Tornado. Totally Non-Lethal, But Totally Effective! The funniest scene in the entire movie is the superhero tryouts.

If you rented this because Spider-Man was out then you obviously didn't take the time to read the box. This movie is exactly what it set out to be; a stinging, yet sweet, send up of the whole super-hero genre.Here's a group of super-hero wannabes, led by the magnificent William H. Macy as The Shoveler, a family man with a wife who keeps pestering him to find another line of work. These guys are Bruce Wayne without money; The Shoveler doesn't have a Batmoblie, he has a Rambler wagon. The closest thing to a Fortress of Solitude that Azaria's Blue Raja can muster is his bedroom in his mothers house. Stiller's Mr. Furious is a frustrated Incredible Hulk. Studi's Sphinx spouts Yoda-like platitudes. Reubens' Spleen leaves criminals wishing for something as benign as a mere spider web. Kinnear's cynical, endorsement-laden Captain Amazing is a bored publicity hound who's bespectacled alter ego eagerly facilitates the release of his most dangerous nemesis, Rush's psychotic Casanova Frankenstein, to justify his continued existence. When Frankenstein and his disco-dancing cohorts capture Captain Amazing, our little rag-tag group decide that it's their duty to step up to the challenge.The best satire is perpetrated by those familiar with their target, and here the film is dead on. The sets and props are very Burton-esque - dark and brooding in the best Batman tradition. Coupled with superb casting and an eclectic soundtrack, the result is a satisfying skewering of a sanctimonious lot.I've never seen the comic series the film is based on, but I'm sure that liberties have been taken.

However, going in to see this movie because one liked the comic would be the wrong reason. It may be great for the same reason the comic is great (if it is great--I don't know.

Whilst they have the main hero(es)battling triumphing over evil in such typical fashion, Mystery Men is the complete flip side to that. In the film, they are on a mission to rescue Captain Fantastic- aka the hugely talented Greg Kinnear- from an evil enemy known as Casanova Frankenstein- aka Geoffery Rush- (great name for a baddie BTW!). The superheroes that make up The Mystery Men are struggling and are of which some of the most inventive-yet amusing ever created. Names include Mr Furious, played by Ben Stiller of where he reminds me of the incredible hulk- personality-wise the fact that he loses his temper and thus as a result, he unleashes his powers against his foes, The Shoveler, played by the underrated and yet impressive William H Macy who takes on villains wearing a mining helmet and brandishing, um, a shovel as his weapon of choice! As well as The Invisible Boy, of whom can only become invisible when nobody is looking(very strange concept indeed!)and The Bowler, who has a bowling ball as her main fighting weapon. Making up the crew are The Spinx and The Blue Raja. The Blue Raja intrigued me a little, considering that at first with the extremely posh London accent, I would've thought the director and Casting Director would've hired a British actor in its place. However, my mind had changed afterwards after seeing a scene where the Raja has a phone call with his mother- and he speaks to her in his real- life American accent, which was very funny! But the character that really got to me was The Spleen and his fart jokes became a little annoying and irksome, the longer the film went on. Nonetheless, they are slightly more interesting than most so-called established superheroes.Before this film came out, I had never heard of, nor familiarised myself with the comics, despite this though where Mystery Men differs and does well, in comparison to those so-called superhero films is that it is very much a parody of and a somewhat smart mickey take on comic book superheroes. Unlike Cyclops, Wolverine and Storm to name, for the exception of Captain Fantastic, Mystery Men's counterparts are still down-to-earth- yet unsuccessful, and of whom carry with them an abundance of wit, charm, silliness and humour. And whilst, the cast is made up of virtually non-A listers, the fact that it has an array of stellar acting talent in the shape of Ben Stiller, William H Macy, Greg Kinnear, Hank Azaria and Geoffery Rush,of whom all provide really good performances as their characters, is impressive still. Plus, they carry the film well without having to succumb to such patronising and overbearing levels of so-called superhero worshipping and conformity in American society and a high level of public expectation being thrusted upon them. The humour is very dry and so unless you are a fan of this type of humour, as well as being a comic book fan, then unfortunately the wise cracks and jokes will not be of your taste and preference.Mystery Men does not attempt to live up to the expectations of films such as Superman, Spider-man, X-Men, nor does it seek to be a rival to those mainstream comic book efforts, rather that it delves deeper into the so- called superhero myth and disseminates and ridicules it by means of questioning a) what it stands for, b)how it is depicted, c) by attacking (not in a harsh way that is) the very conventions and popularisation of superheroes. By means of which i am saying that the likes of the X-Men trilogy, Batman, Fantastic Four etc have become so accepted by the mainstream and in the Hollywood movie business that its initial comic book roots and origins have been stripped away and as a result, its cult factor has deteriorated. Therefore, some of its so called cultural values has been eroded, because of their commercialisation. Or in other words, they have sold out to the mainstream public. Mystery Men, however is a comedic comic book adaptation that is unique, inventive and intriguing that the concept remains original, both to its fans and the comic book fraternity. The dialogue is witty and sharp and the amount of sarcasm is evenly spreaded out within this film, so much so that it doesn't deviate from the script, nor the main plot.Overall, it is a delightful superhero and comic book romp, which as it is a parody, rightfully doesn't take itself too seriously.

It is a flawed masterpiece (that's right, I said the word 'masterpiece' in conjunction with this film). Despite some dodgy editing alongside a director known for making commercials (and it shows!), it actually has many ingenious concepts. The idea that Champion City's most successful superhero is obsessed with his own celebrity and is therefore portrayed as a bad guy ties in perfectly with the anti-capitalist themes in the film. The problems arise when the style of comedy reaches juvenile level, and though at times that brand of humour is funny there is perhaps a little too much of it. There are, however, many hilarious moments, some of which are incredibly subtle for such an 'in your face' production. For example, when Captain Amazing is complaining to his agent about losing his pepsi endorsement he talks about what it means to him, in his heart, and he promptly hits his chest where his heart would be only to hear the hollow sound of his suit's exterior. Pure anti-capitalism! Finally, a mention of the cast. The film has a wonderful cast Ben Stiller, Bill Macy, Hank Azaria, Greg Kinnear, Geoffrey Rush, Jeanne Garofalo, Eddie Izzard, Paul (Pee-wee Herman) Reubens and, best of all, the deep-voiced singing legend that is Tom Waits. So, a masterpiece? a silly but funny superhero spoof? or a superhero spoof that is unsure what it really wants to be? It is rather open to interpretation but one thing is for sure, it's funny!

The hero auditions are a scream, Dr Heller's inventions are brilliant, and the Shoveler's speech is perfect. The only really weak links are the pacing just before the climax, and Ben Stiller is not quite as memorable as the rest of the cast, although he has some good scenes.This is a heck of a lot more fun than 90% of the serious superhero movies, and smarter than most comedies from the same timeframe and later.

There are hardly any scenes where the characters laugh at anything, much less themselves.  To them, who they are, what they're doing and the oddball world they inhabit make perfect sense and need to be taken seriously.Another reason this movie is a hit with those lucky enough to appreciate it, is the collection of memorable, archetypal characters that don't bother to be constrained to the real world.

Mystery Men is a cynical, black comedy twist on the heroic worlds inhabited by Batman and the XMen.  And dammit but it works beautifully.

Rather than a bunch of unified superheroes who are also a force to be reckoned with alone, the Mystery Men are a bunch of misfits who fight worse together than alone, and they are pathetic when they fight alone.First, I can see how the movie bombed.  The maturity level needed for much of the humor in the movie is far too high for almost everyone in the world, so the jokes definitely went right over most people's heads.  The fighting/action was less than stellar when compared to something like X-men. The characters could be annoying at times, and many lacked depth, unlike all of the other traditional superheroes.But while all of those points could be viewed as a negative, they made the movie even better for me.  It was great to see superheroes get in dumb little arguments (like the Bowler's and Mr. Furious' frequent stare downs). Then the characters and their respective powers themselves were hilarious. The Shoveller was kind of normal and the Sphinx's mysterious powers were just coming up with incredibly deep statements, but the rest were great. The Blue Raja who wields the deadly forks (well, they do have points on them); the Spleen (nothing needs to be said about him); the Invisible Boy who is only invisible when no one looks at him; the Bowler who talks to her dad's skull, which is located in a bowling ball.  The corporate spokesmen sellout Captain Amazing was amazing as well, skillfully portraying the loved superhero while not really caring about his fans unless it is bringing him more corporate sponsors.  No one (except Mr. Furious) believed that Captain Amazing was billionaire Lance Hunt because Lance wears glasses.  Captain Amazing doesn't wear glasses.  Ben Stiller's Mr. Furious character is by far the best and funniest character in the movie.  When he raises his arms, you expect some impressive display of strength, but all he manages to do is get beat up and fail to take a decal off of a car.There was no single feature (dialogue, story, action, comedy, etc.) that stood out as excellent, but all of the pieces combined to make Mystery Men a delightful movie and a member of my DVD collection.

It was not advertised or marketed well at all by Universal, and it probably should not have been released in the hyper-competitive summer, but rather perhaps in the winter or the fall, when it would have had less competition from better advertised summer block-buster type films. This is an underdog type of film. It is a superhero action-comedy with a very specific core target audience, and it got lost in the summer schedule, which is a shame, because it is a little cult gem, in my opinion.That said, I really loved this film, and I feel that it at least deserves to develop a cult or fan following. I think that either you get this film or you don't. Those that do get the film are probably people who understand the tropes of superhero comic books, and who appreciate the comic take on superheroes that Mystery Men has (I think that many reviewers did not get this movie, and there was something of a band-wagon effect which branded this a bad picture. It is not a bad picture at all, but is simply a fun action-comedy). For someone who grew up on comics, it was fun to see a superhero action comedy like this. The movie created a cool and quirky fantasy world that felt like a real comic book, and the stellar cast and outrageous characters provided the laughs.Regarding superhero comic books most adolescents who read these comics enjoy them because the stories are power fantasies (amongst other things). These kids like to imagine themselves in the role of a powerful hero or a dark avenger (I know I did). The irony is that many of these kids who are the core audience for superhero comics are usually not very big winners in the real world, but are often outsiders and underdogs themselves. The heroes in Mystery Men are also underdogs and outsiders who dream of being real heroes and winners, despite their mundane and quirky natures. Just as comic book fans dream of being superheroes, so do the loser lead characters of Mystery Men aspire to be heroes also. I liked this parallel.So, comic book fans should be able to identify with the spirit of these characters and this movie. The main characters in Mystery Men are basically third-string wannabe superheroes with comically mundane and quirky powers. Just as many comic book readers want to be superheroes in their own imaginations, so are the lead characters of this movie wannabe superheroes. The character's struggles and desires to be real heroes despite their ineptitude and bargain basement powers is comically heroic, and is the source of both the charm and the comedy of this movie. I liked these underdog characters, found them to be funny, and rooted for them to win in spite of themselves and their ineptitude.Storywise, Champion City's venal first-string superhero, Captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear), is captured by a mad and dangerous villain, Casanova Frankenstein (Geoffery Rush). Three comically inept wannabe superheroes, Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller), The Shoveller (William H. Macy), and The Blue Raja (Hank Azaria) take it upon themselves to try and free Captain Amazing and to fight Casanova Frankenstein and his criminal minions. Finding themselves outnumbered by Casanova's thugs, our three heroes recruit other third-stringers to help, and are joined by Invisible Lad (Kel Mitchell), The Spleen (Paul Reubens), The Bowler (Janeane Garofalo), and The Sphinx (Wes Studi). The wannabe heroes struggle with their own personal problems, self-doubts, quirky powers, and internal bickering, as well as with their villainous opponents. Will they be able to rise above their limitations and save Champion City? That is the basis of the story, but the real fun is the outlandish way the heroes go about trying to accomplish this in colorful and quirky Champion City.The comedy is good, mainly on the strength of the comedic acting and improv talents of the likable leads. The direction, costumes, effects, and production design are both funny and evocative of real comic books (and of many previous comic book films, such as the Batman movies). I believed in the fun-house alternative reality of Champion City, and I enjoyed spending a few hours immersed in that fanciful world (just as I used to enjoy being immersed in the fanciful worlds of superhero comic books in my youth). It is a quirky, colorful, and fun world, full of quirky, colorful, and fun characters. The movie is an entertaining romp, and would be a great cult movie to see at a midnight show.

Having watched it several times, I'd place it somewhere between Grosse Pointe Blank and the original Batman movies, although not as smart as either. It's a lightweight, very amusing comic-book ride through the lives of several awfully underpowered 'superheroes', struggling for recognition in a town overwhelmed by Captain Amazing (Kinnear, who is absolutely marvellous).First things first... in reply to criticisms1. No, it's not deep. You really want a comic-book movie to be as profound as The Seventh Seal? Look at what happens when that's attempted the awful Batman follow-ups, Daredevil... and we still haven't seen what nastiness awaits in The Hulk or X-Men 2 (although the latter at least looks amusing enough).2. Yes, it's camp, tongue-in-cheek nonsense. Anyone who actually believes Mystery Men attempts to be serious, has a message to convey (other than 'believe in yourself') or is anything more than a couple of hours of smiles should reconsider why they're watching it in the first place. It's in the same vein as Flash Gordon or anything Schwarzenegger has made in the last ten years. Enjoy it, and stop analysing it.3. The script isn't too hot. This is entirely true, but how many comics in the 1970s had decent scripts or stories? It's only really since their evolution to high-budget productions, such as graphic novels and so on, that comics have developed any real depth. My personal memories from almost thirty years ago are of week-in-week-out battles with yet-another-supervillain. No major crises of conscience or anything... this is old-style fun.Bearing all this in mind, the film is wonderful. William H. Macy is, of course, outstanding (when isn't he?), and the rest of the cast are superb in their roles. Yes, The Spleen is the adolescent humour, Invisible Boy is almost the token black guy and poor old Ben Stiller really does have a one-dimensional character... but hey, switch off the analytical part of your brain and enjoy it for what it is a film one can watch time and again, chuckle heartily throughout and even enjoy with kids who won't be inundated by rappers thinking it's clever to swear all the time.Recommended viewing, particularly if you have an off-the-wall sense of humour, enjoy the absurd or simply like watching Macy triumph in small roles.

And, of course, being real people - they are rather lame at it, over-shadowed by the city's real hero, Captain Amazing.The sadness and sheer stupidity of grown men (and women) running around dressed up as Super-Heroes is the main gag of the film, and this is played fairly straight - with conflicting home-lives and the effect on jobs acted out in several scenes. But it's mainly fart gags, sarcasm and situation-comedy that provide the laughs throughout the film.All the cast turn in good performances, but it is Hank Azaria (Blue Rajah) that really makes it for me. He has a little cameo in Heat - but you would not recognise him in this film as the camp British Fork-Flinging mother-dominated hero, who uses cutlery as weapons (but not lethal Knives - just Forks and Spoons). Each hero has their Achilles Heel and do not jell as a Team - leadership is required in the form of Sphinx, who teaches them in riddles. When you can balance a Tack-Hammer on your head - you will then have a balanced attack. The super-hero Try-Outs 'round someone's Pool where they discover even lamer heroes is just fantastic - check out PMS Avenger, who only works four days a month and Waffle-Man (Gold and Crispy - bad guys are history) with his Griddle Of Justice and Lo-Cal Truth Syrup.The last 1/4 of the film does drag a little - where you have the build up to the Super-Hero/Villain end battle, but overall a great way to waste a few hours. Just writing this review is making me smirk - it gives you that type of feeling after a few viewings.

Not since The Simpsons have so many incompetent, mediocre characters been made to appear so heroic.A one line description of the plot--a group of untalented super-hero wannabees struggle to save a real superhero and their city--sounds like a recipe for a disastrous film. And it might have been disastrous if the actors had not played their comic roles with such dead-pan sincerity. This film truly does seem dedicated to the average, obscure people among us who doggedly pursue their dreams against all obstacles--including their own innate lack of talent or skill.Mystery Men is extraordinary for a variety of reasons1. Setting/atmosphere. The setting for Mystery Men is a parody of Tim Burton's vision of Batman's Gotham City. Rather limited in scope (some sets are obviously reused), but effective at creating and maintaining the alter earth comic-book feel of this movie. The sheer darkness of sparsely-populated megalopolis Champion City makes you wonder why any truly benevolent superhero would even want to save it. But if you look closely, the set is filled with brutal social satire ala Paul Verhoeven's Total Recall and Starship Troopers.2. Characterization/Casting. Although Mystery Men does not develop characters as well as it should (particularly the villains), it does feature some of the most unique and hilarious characters you'll find on film. Here is a perfect example of how important casting is when turning a script into a film. Who else but Ben Stiller could be so sincerely oblivious as Mr. Furious? Who else but William H. Macy could wield a shovel with such dignity? The best comedy ensemble cast since A Fish Called Wanda and Ruthless People.3. Inside Jokes. Mystery Men is filled with inside jokes, and this may or may not make the film inaccessible to some. But if somehow manage to catch the obscure references to William Shatner, you will likely be rewarded with one good, healthy belly laugh after another throughout the film.4. Dialog. The dialog here is the most consistently entertaining I've heard since Guys & Dolls, made even better by the sheer variety of characters interacting, rather than relying on just one style of elocution. Few films offer so many hilarious sound bites and one-liners.5. Taste. There is really no coherent swearing, gore, or overt sexual references in Mystery Men. Indeed, the lack of filth in this film makes it more fun, if only because of the suspense it creates while we wait to hear the first bad word that we've come to expect from Hollywood. The most foul thing about this film is The Spleen's flatulence, and even that is presented in good taste.6. Rule-breaking. You gotta love films that break rules--you can almost smell the smoke from the filmmakers' battles with studio executives here. In addition to taking on William Shatner and allowing a major character to check out early, the film pokes fun at everything--including itself--it's almost like watching Mystery Science 3000 heckle an MST3K epiosode.Unfortunately, like the similarly brilliant comedy Dogma, Mystery Men suffers from a tedious, action-oriented ending that makes one feel the comedy ends quite some time before the film itself does. This is no excuse for missing the first hour and a half of this hilarious film, however. It's still quite satisfying to the very end.

In fact, I'd say the story itself is actually stronger than those of the later Batman films and has more elements to it.The main characters seemed better developed and better scripted than most of the super-hero films that they are sending-up. I thought the main baddie (bizarrely named 'Casanova Frankenstein' and deliberately hammed-up by Geoffrey Rush) was particularly good, though he didn't seem to have many scenes... This is compensated by the frequent appearance of his 70's disco-obsessed henchmen, who I found hilarious !Overall - an enjoyable film as long as you don't take it too seriously.

I think the setting and mood of Mystery Men is much more appealing as a comic book world than any of the Batman movies ever were. The Batman movies were just too fake. Another reason I think I enjoyed this film is that much of the mood and setting of this film reminded me of The Tick (animated show), another one of my favorite super hero shows. The supporting villains and super heroes, the dialogue and atmosphere could all be part of the Tick universe. Unfortunately the FOX live action show failed to capture what I feel Mystery Men did quite well as far as creating a comic book world.

To be honest, I avoided the film until my fiance strapped me down and forced me to watch it. And am I ever glad that he did.Basically you know the story by now. Captain Amazing, who resembles a NASCAR driver more than a superhero, keeps the community of Champion City safe from supervillians and various do-no-gooders. Trying desperately to ride on his coattails are three hapless heroes who only want the same recognition as Captain Amazing. The Shoveler has a wife and family to support, despite the fact that God gave him a gift to shovel and shovel well. The Blue Rajah, a skilled cutlery thrower, lives with his mother, who has no idea just what he does at night and wonders why he burns so much incense in his room. Mr. Furious is always just THIS CLOSE to going Chernobyl on someone, even though his hand-to-hand skills could use just a bit of work, okay, a lot.Meanwhile, Captain Amazing has a problem there are no more supervillians for him to go after and his sponsors are getting restless. A plan is hatched to get him back on the winning track by releasing one of his arch nemesises, nemesisi...what's the pleural of nemesis? Anyway, one thing leads to another and the plan goes haywire, leaving Captain Amazing captive in Casanova Frankenstein's lair being guarded by two disco baddies. So, the Shoveler, Blue Rajah, and Mr. Furious are out to save the day and rescue Captain Amazing! But they need help....Sound silly so far? Wait, it gets better, but I'll let you find that out for yourselves.A movie like this is just made for sci-fi freaks, comic book conventions, and Monty Python fanatics. The entire cast is incredible. Ben Stiller is amazing as Mr. Furious (his friends call him Roy) who may or may not have superpowers. Jeanene Garofalo's depiction of The Bowler, who has constant arguments with her father's skull that is encased in her ball, is pretty similar to some of the conversations I have with my dad and Jeanene, as always, is an absolute gem. It's really nice to see Paul Reubens reprise his Pee-Wee role a little bit in his portrayal of The Spleen. My personal favourite, however, is Eddie Izzard as Tony P., one of Casanova's boys who insists that disco is NOT dead! Eddie was born to play that role and anyone who has seen his stand-up will know what I mean.The main thing to remember during this movie is to keep your sense of humour wide open, as well as your mind.

They are eventually joined in their quest by other incompetent super-types; the Invisible Boy (Mitchell), the Bowler (Garofalo), the flatulent Spleen and the mysterious Sphinx (Studi). The group gets its chance at acclaim by way of a mission to rescue Champion City's only recognized superhero, the obnoxious Captain Amazing, played convincingly by Greg Kinnear.In comic book tradition, the story boasts an enigmatic super-villain. Geoffrey Rush stars as the campy, yet evil Cassanova Frankenstein. His head henchmen are a pair of unstable disco enthusiasts, Tony P. (Izzard) and Tony C.

The heroes and villains are equally adept, or inadept, at what they do. The film also benefits from special effects, which the filmmakers rightly chose not to beat the viewer over the head with.Of further note are some interesting cameos in the film. Director Michael Bay makes a quick appearance as one of Frankenstein's henchmen, the Frat Boys; sultry dance/soul singer Jody Watley appears as a sensual Disco Girl; and rappers, the Goodie Mob appear as, (who else?), the not-so Goodie Mob. Since Watley was the first African-American female to play Betty Rizzo in Grease on Broadway, I feel she could have been made more integral to the film and cast.Mystery Men is a laugh-after-laugh look at the aspiring side of humanity, or superhumanity.

They had some different characters, but they had Mr. Furious, and a couple of the other superheroes in the film.  By the way, Flaming Carrot is a young man who once locked himself in a bathroom and read 5000 comic books on a dare, and emerged as the Flaming Carrot!  Endowed with martial arts knowledge, a large carrot mask with a flame at the top, an arsenal of unique weapons, a set of flippers (which he wears at all times, just in case he needs to swim), and a small AM/FM radio implanted in his chest by aliens that gives him track tips, he suited up to fight crime.  That could out weird anything the mystery men could throw out.  But, on to the movie...The Movie, is one of the great examples when something obscure gets just the right enough attention to really pull something off well.  Spawn tried to get a following like Mystery Men, but it was too religious minded to really get a following like Mystery Men.  X-Men, although I sort of liked it, really sold out to the public, almost completely rewriting the brilliant story from Marvel comix.  Mystery Men had just the right chemistry to excel, and it did.  The actors are well known enough to carry their own following, but not so well known as to change the movie to suit them.  Ben Stiller, Hank Azaria, Jeannine Garofalo, Keenen Ivory Wayans, and the return of Paul Reubbons marks this movie as one of the strangest mixes of Actor since MARS ATTACKS! albeit this movie is good, while MARS ATTACKS! was lacking.The only problem I noted with this movie, and I feel like a jerk pointing it out, the plot has a few holes in it, especially when they storm the castle with their new weapons.  In the DVD deleted scenes, it shows them using some unexplained weapons on the Frat boys, but of course, those scenes were deleted.  What bothered me was a little side plot about the Shoveler trying to hint at Mr. Furious that he's bringing the team down, that was unnecessary.Don't get me wrong, the good outweighs the slightly notgood, ten thousand times fold.

For one thing, this movie has the same atmosphere about it that the show The Tick has, and this movie definitely tick tocks with perfect timing in its jokes. I also want to point out that this really isn't a parody, but rather a satire of the superhero genre.  A parody makes fun of something so blatantly that you see the source and realize the joke, making you laugh.  A Weird Al song does just that.  A satire makes fun of something, but is much more subtle about it, even attempting itself to be serious, or aims at being taken seriously, and that is what Mystery Men does here.  Mr Furious isn't a direct parody of Wolverine or Batman, but you can recognize the tone of those characters are reflected here, and yet Mr Furious is regarded as an individual  character.The jokes are many.  Some obvious, others more subtle.  Most of them you have to look beneath the surface, or just pay attention to get, and it may also help to have some knowledge in comic books as well.  For instance, the Shoveler's speech about the gift God gave him by making him a good shoveler is great, because many heroes have a gift like that, and they will use similar lines.  When Spleen discusses how he got his powers from a curse, it sounds like he's reading directly from a comic book, and you get the feeling that many heroes introduce themselves by their origin story, and they concern themselves with writing a theme song.The amount of talent gathered in this movie is awesome as well, and you can definitely see that each actor was having a great time working on the film.

This film was made to have sequels. The characters don't even come together until the last section of the movie. It's really a shame that we will never see more of this. A second part would have been faster, funnier and more tightly knit. The story could start off immediately, as we have been introduced to everyone already and we know who they are and what they do.  What is also a shame is that X-Men got far more recognition than this and it follows EXACTLY the same format. This however, will get a sequel while Mystery Men will always be seen as a subpar effort instead of an introduction.

The concept of superheroes with powers not quite super is rich in comic potential. Not all of that potential is tapped, but you only get 2 hours... and you have to squeeze the plot in too. I felt like Kinka Usher did a nice job of developing almost every character (except Lena Olin as supervillain Geoffrey Rush's psychiatrist) and providing a plot that did not seem stripped down. Throw in a lot of sarcastic humor and a great underground comic atmosphere in Champion City and I think it's a tight little movie.If you've been avoiding it, or if you have seen it once and found it odd or off-putting, give it a shot.

Ben Stiller is very amusing as well, showing a weak character trying to make it into the big leagues of superheroes. All of the characters do, and that is an area which I found particuarly ironic. That is because all of the actors are Indie film actors trying to make it into the big leagues of Hollywood.To be honest, the reason I thought it failed at the box-office is that America doesn't get irony.All in all I loved the film, but I feel it would have worked better if more effort was put into tweaking the script rather than having unneccesary CGI landscapes and effects.

Really it's all about the cracking script, which delivers big laughs with almost every line and produces great comic characters who are given layers of subtlety and complexity by the insanely talented cast. At one point, a deadpan Macy gets to say We've got a blind date with Destiny... and it looks like she's ordered the lobster. If you don't find that funny, you might as well stop watching films now. Yes, you.The choice of a pop promo director, Kinka Usher, to helm Mystery Men is inspired. Video directors understand light and colour in a very basic way - when a scene needs to be garish, when it needs to be blackened. And boy, there's a lot of that here. Usher's insistence on a fish-eye lens technique only serves to add further depth to the actors' performances as you're presented with every twitch of their faces. As usual it's Macy who steals the top acting plaudits - how does this man keep getting better? - but Stiller and Azaria both emerge with credit.

Some scenes absolutely advance the story in no way, but they're a blast. Kinka and especially the writers tend to drag on a scene untill all it's hilarity is gone, but bam they switch and you're ready for more.

Mystery Men takes its place  among the classic comic-strip spoofs on TV like  Batman and Captain Nice and cartoons like  Underdog and Super Chicken.  The same spirit  lives in all of them  the comic tongue-in-cheek  tone; the courage to aim for the heroic in life at  the risk of looking ridiculous; the  not-so-sure-footed way that these characters manage  to prevail over their adversaries.  It's the  misfired spark of nobility igniting in the weak and  the ordinary, and it's wonderful to see it glow so  high and bright here.Mystery Men opens on a party at a nursing home.  I  wish Kinka Usher had had the sense to give more  energy and life to the old people in the scene.  As  it is, it looks like something George Romero might  have devised.  We need to get the feeling that these  old people are as sharp as everyone else, or it  feels patronizing.  By the time the Red Eyes crash  the festivities, you half expect Tom Waits who plays  a weapons inventor with a penchant for ladies in  their eighties to stand up and shout  Just what  this party needs--a little excitement!  If writer  Neil Cuthbert had any sense, he would have had Waits  mixing it up with the intruders and egging on the  partiers to do the same.  It would have made for a  rousing beginning, and a better introduction of the  troublesome trio the Shoveler (William Macy); the  Blue Raja (Hank Azaria); and Mr. Furious (Ben  Stiller), who seem to come out of nowhere to save  the day. There are many other problems to Mystery Men than  I care to go into; among them that the villain  Casanova Frankenstein needs to have as cultivated a  sense of the absurd as the rest of the people in  this movie, and he doesn't.  Geoffrey Rush is the  wrong actor for the part; he needs to be way over  the top to make the conflict between good and evil a  galvanic one.  And Rush has never exhibited a talent  for the outre.  You hope for the ripe theatrics of a  John Lithgow in The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai  or the dry, debonair diffidence of a Paul Freeman  in Raiders of the Lost Ark.  Instead what we get  is pastiche; something half-baked and not fully  realized.There are too many ideas running through Mystery  Men for anyone to tie them neatly together, and  that may be its deepest problem.  But whatever kind  of a mess it is is the kind of mess I love.  Ben  Stiller has always seemed to be slumming in the  roles he takes.  This one is no exception, but he  goes at it with such conviction that you come away  feeling that he'd learned something about comedy  growing up in a household run by Jerry Stiller and  Anne Meara.  His Roy is related to all the put-upon,  overly sensitive, chronically defensive types that  Woody Allen made popular.  And whether it's  wheedling his way into the affections of the  waitress at his favorite hangout (the sleek Claire  Forslani), or questioning the wisdom of a fellow  superhero (Wes Studi as the Sphinx), or giving a new  member of their elite group (Jeaneane Garofalo in  what are possibly her funniest moments on screen) a  hard time, he makes it always fun to watch.  I  couldn't exactly say that about him in There's  Something About Mary.Jeaneane Garofalo proves with this performance that  she should have been the star of One True Thing,  not Renee Zellweger.  I don't think I have ever seen  funnier exchanges between a daughter and father  (okay, so he's dead and his skull is in a bowling  ball, so sue me) in the movies.  And the funny part  about this role is that it feels like a screwball  reprise of Emily Watson's spellbinding talks with  God in Breaking the Waves.  And in this version,  the girl doesn't die, and bells don't ring in your  head.William H. Macy does something very difficult; he  makes stolid magnetic.  You understand right away  what's attracted Jenifer Lewis' Lucille to Eddie.  You can also understand her exasperation.  The barbecue alone would be enough to drive me over the edge, but when Eddie's adorable, half-breed son looks up at his father and says I believe in you, Daddy. to which Lucille sighs and exclaims, Roland, don't encourage your father, you feel like standing and hailing Neil Cuthbert as a first-rate wit. With Hank Azaria (whose only moment of note in film up to this point was his bare behind in The Birdcage) and Louise Lasser (Has it been more than two decades since we first took note of her in Bananas and Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman?) as son and mother who share a fondness for silverware; Greg Kinnear as Captain Amazing and Ricky Jay as his publicist; Kel Mitchell as Invisible Boy; Paul Reubens as The Spleen; and Lena Olin who, if she didn't have the few lines in this movie that she has, would seem to be visiting the set.

And it lacks much of the energy a comedy needs to get your average audience member to sit through it without checking his or her watch. On the other hand, it's also got some laugh-out-loud funny lines, a talented and earnest cast, and the classic underdog premise. Macy, Stiller, and Azaria are brilliant as the core team, and Garofalo and Studi do superb work adding conflict and variety to the team. I can't say Reubens or Mitchell added much to the film overall, though each had a few chances to shine. The plot, as I said above, is your classic underdog-makes-good stuff. No surprises there, since you know they're going to triumph. What makes it worthwhile is not the absurd, gaudy heroes and villains, but the dialogue and interplay between the characters. Underneath it all, these people are children at heart, who just want to do right. The best scenes in the film give this film its emotional grounding. Look at Azaria's relationship with his long-suffering mother; Macy's endearing innocence in his unwillingness to accept Cap. Amazing's secret identity; Stiller's rage (not unlike that one weird, spazzy kid you once knew who'd always go into quivering, impotent rages on the playground); Garofalo's desire to avenge her father. This childlike belief that a sense of justice and goodness will always make the world a better place, is the true appeal of super-hero comics; and underneath its parodic exterior, Mystery Men shows us why these hackneyed comic-book tropes matter to so many.It never really gels into a satisfying whole, due to the huge number of half-baked subplots (romance, family life, conflicts within the team, etc.), but the main plot is such loopy fun that it makes up for that.

Through my experience I have come to believe that top quality comedy is achieved through character, and the portrayal of character in mystery men is superb.  Every character is funny in his own way and each character has a very unique and consistent personality.  Prepare yourself for a lot of parody and satire in this one.  Not just on super hero movies and comics, but on society in general.  To conclude this is an excellent movie that I'd recommend to anyone.

In all fairness, I've never actually read one of the comic books that inspired this film, but I don't think that matters; the story unfolds just like a comic book would. Bright colours and busy backdrops throughout the film make it feel as though cartoon bubbles should be popping out of everyone's mouths.We are treated to some utter silliness right from the get go, and our heroes feel so familiar to us in a way that almost defies understanding. But I think it's because unlike most of the superheroes that we've come to know and revere, these guys make the same kind of boneheaded blunders that we all do on a regular basis. They look and act like knobs and basically crime fighting is their hobby. It makes them seem all the more real despite the ridiculous nature of their powers and/or trademarks.It's the villains that are truly ridiculous and harder to relate to. From disco loving pimp-like thugs to corporate big-wig down-sizers to fraternity boys, they all serve as amusing adversaries but without too much focus on them as most of the fun comes from learning the history of each of the Mystery Men and their dysfunctional roles in society.There are many very funny moments that are almost completely contextual which means the film gets better and better as it goes along. But I guess you have to be in the right mood for this kind of film and just go with it. I can see how someone might see it as stupid or silly, but I can safely say that they've put a lot of thought and creativity into this venture, and I found myself wishing it was longer even after almost two hours.Another factor of this film to be commended on is it's intentional downplay of lethal force. For the most part, the violence is physical and the heroes weapons are not instruments of death.My hope is that Universal will choose to offer supplementary bonus material on the imminent DVD release of this film, as they have with their other excellent Collector's Editions that feature great behind the scenes moments and interviews. I'm sure there's plenty of interesting background on a film like this one.

It would seem on premise that this would be ripe with great satire, but instead you mostly get mush. The team handling this film should be pretty ashamed.Mystery Men is based on a Bob Burden Dark Horse comic, which I'll admit I know nothing about, but I assume it's got some artistic integrity and way more than this film has. The characters all seem interesting enough and their backgrounds amusing, but all of that potential is completely disregarded to make room for stupid jokes and quibbling between characters, obviously a decision from the people putting this thing together.Plotwise, Champion City is protected by Captain Amazing (Kinnear), but his success makes it tough for the small-time crime fighters like Mr. Furious (Stiller), The Shoveler (Macy) and the Blue Raja (Azaria) to make a difference. Of course that changes when Casanova Frankenstein (Rush) is released from an asylum and captures Amazing.The problem here is just a lack of depth. While the plot sounds childish, there is some good spoofing going on, like how Cpt. Amazing is Lance Hunt without glasses but nobody has figured it out. Overall, it just never seems to go far enough and gets traded in for characters arguing with the old no, you tell me, routine and useless taking over the world schemes. While some of the characters are funny, we never get enough of their personalities, just their hit or miss jokes.The color palette for this film was interesting yet scattered-brained as well and the costumes were all over the place. I think in general, lack of sufficient direction is this film's greatest weakness. I'm not surprised director Kinka Usher has never done anything and hasn't since Mystery Men. There is no exact vision for this film other than hodge-podge and slapstick. In the right hands, these interesting characters could have really taken life and the humor would have followed along with it.

As I recall I liked it but was maybe a little let down given my expectations. Apparently though I was alone in even that amount of praise. I remember at the time this movie getting a lot of flak, I had a couple of friends that out and out hated it. Maybe it was just unrealistic expectations from everybody given the film's stellar cast. Maybe the fact that it takes so many visual cue's from the Batman franchise(Burton and Schumacher alike), when people still had a bad taste in their mouth from 'Batman & Robin.' Maybe it's because superhero movies at that time were few and far between, so the references were just flying over people's heads...maybe if it had been released just a few years later things would've been different. Or maybe...just maybe it wasn't everyone's cup of tea. But it's my understanding that this film is finally starting to develop something of a cult following and I can see why.I just watched this movie again, more than ten years later and I loved every minute of it. What many might have considered to be dumb in it's original run is actually a very clever commentary on superhero conventions. Out characters are gifted with ridiculous powers and skills that in no way should amount to any kind of heroics, and yet somehow they do...an extreme take on the superheros we're actually meant to take seriously. They poke fun at secret identities and costumes...these guys are just as concerned with allying their super persona with coherent themed branding so they can be recognizable to potential fans.The movie is a parody on a genre that hadn't quite gotten its footing in the mainstream yet, and I'm sure that was its real downfall. Quite frankly with the A-list cast it should've been more financially successful regardless of the script, I just don't think many people quite knew what to make of it. If you were one of the many who was disappointed or in some way put off by this film back '99 I would recommend giving it a second shot.

I also love the name of their master-villain nemesis Casanova Frankenstein, as well as the team's encounters with the so-mysterious The Sphinx who delivers his sage wisdom in a host of hilarious contradictory sayings.All the actors convince in their unlikely roles by playing it dead straight. I almost had a double-take when I saw and heard the usually sozzled, grizzle-voiced singer Tom Waits enjoying himself as the mad inventor Doc Heller (talk about your bold casting, it would have been so easy to call up Christopher Lloyd!) while Geoffrey Rush and Eddie Izzard ham and camp, hamp if you like, their roles as the super villain and his right-hand man.In the heroes camp, Stiller is fine as the well-balanced Mr Furious - he has a chip on both shoulders but the scene-stealer here is William H Macy's turn as the Shoveller, the reasoning, beating heart of the group, even more than Stiller.The production values are laudably high, especially the cinematography, with the reproduction of the bustling metropolis, the special effects of Frankenstein's big bad weapon's powers and the interiors at his criminal mansion all excellently done. There are plenty of laughs too, mixing the droll with the big laughs, my favourite scenes including Stiller's disaffection with the Sphinx, Invisible Boy's explanation of his powers (he can't turn invisible if people are watching him!) and the ridiculous different groups of henchmen Casanova surrounds himself with, including fur-loving dancing females, a bunch of Frat Boys and Izzard's Disco Boys.I'm sorry to see from the numbers that this film was a flop on release as I would have liked to have gotten to know these reprobates much better - I guess they should have recruited Box-Office Boy to come to their rescue...

I am especially in awe of the relationships that develop between the stars of the film. It was said that much...if not most...of the dialog was improvised, giving the cast a chance to really play off of one another scene by scene. This tactic works well with regards to how they relate...and ultimately become friends over the course of the film. this could actually even be compared to another movie which shares similar motifs Galaxy Quest. This becomes a movie of ultimate redemption by the underdogs - not by the use of any inherent REAL superior powers, but they succeed simply because the cast in BOTH movies eventually live up to what they believe to be their destinies...by the belief in themselves!Most of the movie-going public and critics alike panned Mystery Men right out of the gate, which is a shame. I have watched this picture multiple times and find new, subtle nuances that make this just a pleasure to behold. if you desire a movie to just lose yourself into with no expectations of and groundbreaking epiphanies, THIS is the film for you!

Despite their best efforts everything always seems to go wrong and they are constantly living in the shadow of the city's favorite hero Captain Amazing. When Amazing is captured by a recently released super-villain it is their chance to prove to everyone, including themselves, how important they really are.I'll start by saying that Mystery Men is absolutely hilarious and one of most clever and subtle comedies ever made. All at once the Mystery Men are spoofing super hero conventions while being heroes themselves. Ben Stiller gives the best performance of his career as Mr. Furious; whose failed puns and inability to use his power to any affect are the two funniest running gags in the film. Backing up Ben Stiller is an superb ensemble cast almost all of whom give amazing performances that are at once resonant and hilarious. In addition to Ben Stiller; William H Macy, Hank Azaria and Greg Kinnear are high points.I also want to point out that Mystery Men isn't just a good comedy, it's one of the best movies about super heroes ever made. Never have super heroes been portrayed in this realistic light. These are super heroes that live with their mothers, have low self esteem, and can't talk to women. This is an underdog story in the truest sense of the word and you can't help but root for them because they're like real people. Much like Watchmen reinvented super heroes in the 80's as cruel and sometimes impotent lunatics, Mystery Men reinvents them as well meaning losers.Don't let the critics or the paltry 5.9 IMDb rating fool you this is one of a kind. I highly recommend this to everyone and I implore you to not this let cinematic gem slip through the cracks. People who don't appreciate good movies....Make Me Furious!

The movie centres around a group of general mis-fits that attempt to be Super Heroes, most of them have nothing more than a keen desire to go out and defeat crime with the talents they have. What makes this movie worthwhile is the earthiness of the characters, they are not bound up with standing o street corners with their hands on their hips looking proudly outward at the world they have just made a better place, but are busy trying to find situations to Set Justice to. And with nothing more than the idea that the things they are fairly good at will get them through their crime fighting ordeals.Janeane Garofalo as the bowler certainly adds depth to this movie and Ben Stiller is wonderful as he always is when he shows his rage , as is Hank Azaria with his ability to do accents and play odd ball rolls, and the rest of the troupe are excellent, especially the invisible kid )Watch this if you are after some light heated fun.9/10 "},{"Title":"Brilliant, hilarious, fun to watch","Date":"16 August 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Fantasy","Review":" This is my favorite 'poke fun at superheroes' movie, with it's pepsi covered costume, 'disco boys' corvette limo, and the boy who thinks he's invisible.

Comic book super heroes are silly and juvenile and this move treats them in a satirical but understanding way. This has ensemble cast of good actors playing the most obscure un-heroic un-super sub heroes ever conceived. It is funny and half way intelligent, and some of the super heroes like Pee Wee Herman's Spleen, who can knock out bad guys with precision farts, is funny but not too crude. The heroes all have their quirks & personalities and the dialog and humor is good. We have William Macy playing The Shoveler, a regular not bright laborer by day who fights crime with a silver plated spade at night. Then there is the Blue Raja, played by Hank Azaria who sells high end silverware by day and talks with an English accent as he attempts to subdue criminals by throwing forks and spoons, not knives. Geoffry Rush plays the requisite mad scientist evil bad guy, Casanova Frankenstein, threatening to kill the premier superhero and blow up the world, right on. Go see it, it's a lot of fun. My main complaint is the tackiness of styles, from cars to clothes, that passes for comic book camp, with cheesy styles from the 30's up to the present tossed in that frankly were unsightly and annoying. We had them drive around in some 50s station wagon, the Shoveler's family car by day, chasing Casanova Frankenstein in his stretch limo made out of a 67 Corvette Stingray to the Disco Boys bad gang stuck in the 70s.

What I do know is that Mystery Men is one of my favourite comedies of all time with a script that constantly throws up many absolute gems of dialogue.Anyway, the plot sees the Mystery Men doing what they do best . . . . being pretty lame superheroes who simply seem to screw things up until Captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear in his great smarmy mode here) comes along and saves the day. But when Casanova Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush, who is wonderfully OTT) manages to trap Captain Amazing it's up to the Mystery Men to save the day. Mr Furious (Ben Stiller doing his best impotent rage schtick) thinks they should just go for it while the others feel they would benefit from the guidance of the mysterious Sphinx. Can the underdogs save the day? What this film has in abundance is style, wit and a genuinely magnificent ensemble cast including Stiller, Kinnear, Rush, Hank Azaria, William H. Macy, Janeane Garofalo, Claire Forlani, Kel Mitchell, Paul Reubens, Lena Olin, Eddie Izzard, Tom Waits and more.The look of the whole thing is like a cross between Gotham City and . . . . . some other, warped Gotham City. The characters and their particular talents are all depicted well and the camera twirls around and provides some crazy POV shots (a la Frankenstein's finger) in a way that just makes it feel as if it's joining in with all the fun instead of just shooting the action.Each cast member is pretty much perfect. If you don't like Stiller's angry young man work then you're not going to be won over here but, personally, I think he does it brilliantly. Garofalo is at her wisecracking, jaded best. Azaria is wonderful, Reubens is disgustingly amusing but the revelation here is Macy, showing real warmth and a great sense of how to play the comedic element straight a la Tommy Lee Jones in Men In Black.The rating here for this movie is shockingly low and should be rectified immediately. A fantastic comedy that I can watch once a week and never tire of.See this if you like The Specials, Superhero Movie (although that's a much inferior debacle), Dodgeball.

But this one, Mystery Men had a better chance, and tried to go the dark humor and campy way - maybe not dark enough or campy enough and turned out sillier than expected. But truly this is NOT a bad thing, but not a good thing for a film overall.The most noticeable cast that didn't work for me was Ben Stiller as Mr. Furious. It played camp - dull camp. I didn't care much for Paul Ruben's Spleen character either - just another excuse to throw in immature fart jokes wherever possible.Casts that worked better was Jeanne Garafalo as Baby Bowler, Hank Azaria as the Blue Raja, and William H. Macy as the Shoveller. Kel Mitchell as the Invisible Boy was working until we were still left in doubt (to me... just to plug in a genital joke) and Wes Studi as the Sphinx character was fine. So why did I give it a 3? The best character cast with the material as given was Casanova Frankenstein as played by Geoffrey Rush - a great look into 'pre-Barbossa'. A must not miss. Played ridiculously, campy and chewing the scenery every time he appeared ...but what a hoot! By adding in the horrible Disco Boys gang with this performance, it was funny as all send ups can be....and yes, Eddie Izzard's performance as Tony P. was so dead on for a 20 years past 'disco boy' -- these were the only times I laughed when these characters appeared on the screen.Now, there is something to be said about Greg Kennear and his Captain Amazing's character. As far as working with what he had, it was a good performance. Where they took this 'hero' and why was a fine touch but the rest of the film didn't seem glue tight around it.This is not to write this is a bad film and not worth your time. You'll probably get amused here and there depending on your humor level. It is not a 'bad' film but not as great as it ... could have been. It's like knowing you have bunch of 'A' students working on material you assume will be an 'A' but turns out to be a 'D'.So I propose...do a remake.

This type of satire on super-heroes is difficult to pull off since most people think any super-hero is a satire anyway. Grown men and women dressed in strange costumes are hard to take seriously, unless you're a pre-teen, usually. This movie uses the overall silly super-hero premise as a springboard and dives headfirst into the utterly odd world of super-heroics, focusing on a group of costumed do-gooders who are blue-collar, low rent - however you want to term them. They have no money for fancy headquarters or super weapons (which most super-heroes in comic books always seem to), and even no super-powers. The Bowler (Garofalo), introduced late, does have a supernatural bowling ball she tosses about, but that's it. When you think about it, this movie presentation of super-heroes actually comes closer to depicting what it would really be like if super-heroes actually existed. I always found the endless supply of funds for HQ and transport in super-hero comics to be really tough to buy into. The satire works, for the most part. The heroes here are pretty inept. They usually start out OK on a mission, such as in the beginning, to the rescue at an old folks home. They have the right attitude and commitment. But we find that this gets them only so far, as even lousy-seeming criminals get the best of them in the end, and the heroes limp back to their homes with cuts and bruises. The core trio are very good Mr. Furious (Stiller), the Shoveler (Macy) and Raja (Azaria) form the epicenter of a great cast. The only real hero seems to be Capt.Amazing (Kinnear), but he's an arrogant opportunist heavy into endorsements. The underdog heroes are placed in the position of rescuing him from the villain (Rush), a Germanic psycho job resembling a combo Lex Luthor/Joker, but they tend to foul things up, so we know things won't go too well. However, since their hearts are in the right place (unlike Capt.Amazing), they should persevere, with the help of the truly mysterious Sphinx (Studi). It's amusing throughout, with some of the loser-heroes, notably Stiller as Mr.Furious, trapped by in-fighting and loss of confidence. The verbal sparring between Furious and most of the others is worth a chuckle or two, especially when he challenges the sagely advice of the Sphinx. The set design and atmosphere are quite well done, having a vaguely futuristic / Gotham City feel to it. This doesn't become an instant classic, probably because of the director's inexperience. He focuses a bit too much on fancy angles & editing, taking away from the whole satirical experience. It could of used some fine-tuning in some sequences and the 3rd act seems sort of by the numbers to get things resolved in a heroic manner. But it's fairly enjoyable, reminding most of us of why we liked to sit down and read those four-color adventures in the first place they were a fun escape from the rigors of conformity.

On the one hand, it tries to be a slapstick comedy, on the other a satire of hero-villain stereotypes, yet it never really succeeds in doing anything.  The comedy present is mostly in the form of humorous one-liners, while many scenes appear serious in an attempt at irony that is quite confusing.  I can only take the action to be a try at humorous parody of the typical super-hero fare, yet it succeeded mainly in being awkward.  The plot was perfectly abysmal, the score uninteresting, and thus the film was overall fairly un-engaging.  The acting was good, especially considering the bizarre characters and lines in the film, but it wasn't quite enough to overcome the uneasiness created by so many other parts of the movie.  Also, some very bad acting (especially between Ben Stiller and the waitress) detracted from the strange but somewhat laudable performances throughout the remainder.  The cinematography was decent, and to its credit the movie was effective in creating a very unique ambience; unfortunately, the interesting environment was used for the most part to alienate the viewer, leaving one trying to figure out what's important in the film.  I must make the disclaimer that I am almost entirely unfamiliar with most superhero movies (or comic books, etc), so perhaps the failure in comprehension was my fault and not the movie's.  Overall, original idea, good setting, reasonable acting, and I laughed a few times; on the other hand, none of that saves it from the overwhelming sense of unjustifiable weirdness (and normally I like weird movies).  5/10 "}{"Title":"Witty!","Date":"19 September 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Fantasy","Review":"  This is a witty, good-hearted spoof of superhero films.

We are never happy, when we are alone.There are several direct themes employed in this movie and passion is chief among them.The magic of the Super-Hero is the ability to be larger than life without the benefit of sound. Tell me how to sell a major movie production the absence of sound. The trade is action and the more seen makes for the better scene.So a Hero must speak despite heroic action and speak without heroic action.Tom  "},{"Title":"Waste of effort, time and money","Date":"13 December 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Fantasy","Review":"  I looked at the cast of this movie and i thought YAH!!

It has an excellent cast who create a really great central ensemble, interesting characters, excellent central premise and some genuinely funny gags. Unfortunately it also has lacklustre direction, overly long running length, some plot incoherence, scenes that are painfully unfunny and a criminal lack of satirical bite.The main characters, I have to say, are superbly cast. Of particular note are the performances of William.H.Macy, superbly subtle as the put upon husband who is committed to the group, and Janeane Garofalo, consistently funny talking to her dead father. But the script sometimes doesn't give them the opportunity to fully realize the potential of the most original, off the wall movie characters that I have seen in a long time. The premise these characters are in, a group of mildly powered superhero wannabe's trying to fight crime, feels like it should have heralded a better screenplay. It starts promisingly enough, the Superman parody, Captain Amazing's product endorsement (showing the satirical bite that should have been in this movie but was sadly lacking from the rest of the plot), through to interviewing prospective Superheroes and the wrecking of Casanova Frankenstein's car all fully explore the potential of the script but after that it falls into the cliche of the heroes finally working together well and getting easily to the final confrontation, almost failing but ultimately saving the day. It feels wrong, the Mystery Men should have won by default, the Blue Raja's stray fork accidently hitting a hidden switch that ejects the villain through a skylight, they should never stop being wannabe's who try their best but ultimately fail unless assisted by luck. That would have made the second half of the screenplay a whole lot funnier and made the movie better than it was. The one part of the screenplay that really didn't work was Tom Wait's character and the whole non-lethal weapons aspect, it felt like it belonged in a James Bond spoof rather than in a superhero film. Plus the non-lethal weapons simply weren't funny, the plot would have flowed a lot better and time could have been saved by cutting them out.That's not to say that the film isn't enjoyable, it's very funny in parts, has some good set pieces, the Egg Salad speech being my favorite, the characters are interesting and, it will keep you entertained for a couple of hours.

Look at any book that Alex Ross has illustrated and you can see that adhering to real-life visual representations would reduce the impact of the scenes.

Ben Stiller and William H. Macy arguing over Captain Amazing's secret identity is one of the film's funnier moments.  All the cast does a good job of capturing the kind of unbased enthusiasm their characters have for their calling.Problems?  A couple.  The humor isn't as strong to the finish as I would have liked.  Paul Reubens has a funny enough schtick as The Spleen, but he's hidden under so much makeup and costumes and speaks with a very bad lisp which combine to prevent his ability for gregarious physical comedy to show. Also, none of the villains are given enough time to fully come to fruition. I'd have dearly loved to hear more of the backstory behind Casanova Frankenstein's genesis, but unfortunately he's just your standard supernemesis.  It feels a bit long, and falls a bit flat near the end, but the main characters are well fleshed out enough by that time that you'll be curious to see how the finale plays out.All in all, it was much better and funnier than I had expected given its poor showing at the box office.

The main reason might be that the crazy comic cliches are only hinted at, but never really executed. There are these wonderfully silly characters - The Shoveler, Mr.Furious, the Spleen - but they never really get fully into action, neither are their super-powers really made fun of. There is this scene at the restaurant at the beginning when Shoveler and Blue Raja mock each other about their code names - this is the kind of humor I would have liked to see much more. Superhero cliches are a wonderful stuff to make fun of - sideswipes to real DC and Marvel superheros would have been easy, but unfortunately do not happen.Mystery Men tries too much to be an action flick instead of highlighting the humor part. Simply putting silly characters into a story does not make it funny - the silly characters have to do  more silly things, talk silly, act silly.

Perhaps that's why one gang of villains in Mystery Men are the Disco boys, because (as we all know) Disco is just as outrageous a dress code; even when they drive through a tunnel, the tunnel lights reflect into their limo like a dance strobe light.

While there are plenty of humorous moments, it is unlikely that this movie will elicit more than a few chuckles from most viewers.  So on the comedy scale, MM earns an almost score of 7.So what about the adventure aspect?  I saw this movie on DVD, which had the option of watching deleted scenes separately from the movie.  While watching the film, there were times that I thought things happened with too little explanation or setup.  Then I watched the deleted scenes and found the explanations I was looking for.  (For example, the Shoveler tells his wife he will give up crime fighting, but in his next scene, he is standing beside his comrades, ready to save the day.  One of the deleted scenes shows Mr. Furious convincing him to stay in the gang.  Why was this scene left out?)  There's plenty of adventure, but with such questions popping up frequently, on this scale MM earns another almost score of 7.Then there's the drama aspect.  It's hard not to empathize with these guys as they try to pursue what they believe is their destiny even though their abilities are mediocre.  But it would have helped if we had been given some information on their backgrounds.  How did they discover their powers?  How did they meet?  What keeps them going since they experience frequent failures?  Again, with such persistent unanswered questions, MM only earns an almost score of 7.So the overall rating of MM is 7.  It's an average movie, and I can't help wishing someone with a grander vision would have stepped in and punched up the script.

"},{"Title":"Great Potential","Date":"30 April 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Fantasy","Review":"  This is one those movies that make you wish it could have been better, and would have been better with one more rewrite and a smaller budget.  Based on Bob Burden's Dark Horse comic book Mystery Men, about a group of second-string, milltown superheroes, the movie is about a group of superhero wannabees that keep going despite their constant defeats.  Its an inspiring premise, but the writing is not there, which is truly dissappointing.  The flavor of the comicbook, darkly satirical, also is not there. Why the big studios cannot believe in better writing and think overblown special effects will cover all flaws, I'm afraid will be an eternal mystery.   The cast is stunning, and it's amusing that most reviewers denigrate some actors and characters, while adoring others; and they're always different ones.  The fact is that the best part of the movie is the actors who play the heroes, who are ALL great in their parts. Greg Kinnear is hysterical as the sellout Superman, Jeneane Garafolo (sp?) is too adorable as the Bowler, and only Paul Rheubens could have brought the Spleen to life as he did.  (Can you see anyone else making that part work?) William Macy and Hank Azaria were perfectly cast, and Ben Stiller was actually too likable as Mr. Furious.  Geoffrey Rush, a great actor, was unfortunately miscast as the villain.  I wonder what David Warner would have done with it?  The writers should have been Frakulated for thier lack of use of the Mystery Men history, which would have made the movie much more enjoyable.  Kinka Usher should have demanded and waited for a better script. His direction received entirely too much criticism, for two reasons; he was trying to present the movie in comic book view which he succeeded in, and what was he supposed to do with a script that wasn't there?  The movie does have funny moments, but they are disconnected moments without a structure to support them. The movie also has its heart in the right place, and has a good message for young and old.  The movie is well-worth watching for those moments, which puts it ahead of 90% of other movies on the market.  Is it worth renting at Blockbuster?  Hell, yes!

Its not what you call a good film, it has some funny scenes and characters but its just a real time waster.  The cast is fantastic and seemed to be having an absolute ball playing a variety of super hero/mystery men characters.  Geoffrey Rush is superbly OTT as the evil nemesis of Captain fantastic.  The other mystery men are really hit and miss.  Fans of toilet humour will appreciate the Sphinx and his special ability, and people who like Jeanne Garafalo's style will like her overly sarcastic character.  William H Macy was probably the best as shovel man, he played it so straight faced almost semi serious.  Still while there are plenty of jokes to be had in this film, there are many that miss the mark.  Its almost like you can see where they are going or wanted to say, but it just doesn't quite hit home. It was a timewaster, but it wasn't a waste of time.

I also thought the Captain Amazing and Casonova Frankenstein characters were creative and funny as well. On the other hand, I thought it was a tad bit on the long side. There were a few scenes and characters they could have done without. For instance, I wasn't crazy about the Sphinx character. The weapons designer guy (I forget his name) wasn't too great either.

Director Kinka Usher should have stayed with music videos - if this movie had been a 5 minute infomercial, then it might have succeeded... but at almost two hours it just manages to bore you to death.In this movie, Usher showcases the idiotic school of look what I can do with a camera!, with a lot of absolutely-in-your-face shots (is anybody interested in counting nose hairs?), and camera-on-the-ground-and-aimed-up shots.  At least the camera doesn't jerk around in short choppy movements (Homicide, anyone?), but that's about all that can be said for it.Most of the performances are dull and bland.  Kinnear usually has a comic presence, but in this one he's about as funny as a brick.  Lena Olin is completely wasted in this film - all of her lines can fit on to a single page.  Geoffrey Rush tries, but he can't do the monomaniacal supervillain, not with this material.  Only Garofalo and Reubens seemed to actually be able to do anything with the script such as it is... but for the most part the script is just a bunch of thrown-together moments that don't coalese into anything coherent and lifelike.  As for Wes Studi... that's the kind of character you thought only existed in a bad movie - oh, wait, here we are.The F/X are nothing fancy, and for the most part look like they were thrown in at the last minute.  They're not even consistent.Costuming is actually fairly decent... the wannabe heroes *look* like wannabe heroes - until they get into their new fancy costumes near the end, when they look like rejects from a KISS concert.The music is immediately forgettable... yet this is the kind of movie which cries out for a killer soundtrack.Take any superhero movie you've ever scene, mix together the bad and the indifferent material, and throw it into a wannabes need to save the day plot and you've got Mystery Men.

Ever since Burton hit it big with Batman a decade ago, filmgoers have seen a hint of the best and definitely the worst of the pages to celluloid transitions.1999 brought us this one that falls somewhere in the middle. The critics and many on-line reviewers dumped Mystery Men on the scrap-heap right away but the film does have its bright spots.Please keep in mind that the film is a comedy and is certainly not supposed to be some kind of award winner. It's a film to watch for enjoyment, not deep meaning.First the film's overall look. Burton's Gotham City in Batman Returns and Shumacher's Gotham in either of his monstrosities had to be the most overdecorated and underpopulated cities ever shown on the screen. Champion City not only looks good, but has what the others lacked PEOPLE WALKING THE STREETS AT ALL HOURS! This was without a doubt the first thing I noticed in the theater.Second The dialogue of the characters. Many said this was a great cast that went to waste. Fine, it's not Fargo. But again, it's not supposed to be! The cast delivers lines in a very natural, flowing style throughout the film. There's no I speak, now you speak - let's read the script together feel here like in so many other comics movies.Third The photography. Fine, Usher uses lots of fish eye and upshot. But if you have ever bothered to look at a comic book, you'll notice these kinds of angles are used quite a bit. The style matches the material.Fourth The cast. There was not one person in the cast that got on my nerves. No Alicia Silverstone, no Wil Smith, no Milo the dog. The cast worked well together on screen and none were forced onto the audience as the big name.The film has its down sides as well.After a few viewings (and especially after Usher's commentary on the DVD) you can pick out spots where heavy editing ocurred.The soundtrack gets in the way sometimes and takes away from the scenes it intends to help. I've never been one for hip soundtracks (or songs inspired by the film...).The villain doesn't do much. But at least he's not jumping around like an idiot trying to be over the top.It's not a fantastic super-hero film but it's not horrible. Who knows, in 10 years or so it may go the route of a cult film. For now, if you are looking for an interesting no-brainer that slaps around the Shumacharian comic fodder we've been fed the last few years, give it a look.

Add that trend to the trend of having less-than-superheroes as the protagonists of their own films, and you get Mystery Men as a result.This movie is about the efforts of a disparate group of five 'heroes' to thwart an Evil Guy in his attempts to do something-or-other to a fictional city. (It's conflicts like these that are the staple of many a comic book, aren't they?)Will our heroes save the day? Is there water in the ocean? Of course they will!So what kind of heroes do we have? Well, we have Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller), whose superpower is that he's..... well, furious; The Blue Raja (Hank Azaria), who throws his mother's cutlery and speaks with a British accent, even though he's neither British not clad in blue; The Spleen (Paul Reubens), whose flatulence will level people for several yards; The Shoveler (William H. Macy), whose prowess with the titular garden implement is legendary; The Bowler (Janeane Garofalo), who tosses a bowling ball that happens to house the skull of her dead father, himself a noteworthy bowler; and Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell), who only turns invisible if absolutely no one is looking at him at the time.Let's face facts here. This is not a complex movie. You know who your good guys are and you know who the bad guy is (Geoffrey Rush, in an ineffectual performance). You might not be entirely clear on what the bad guy wants to accomplish, but who gives a darn anyway? The characters all seem to be having a grand old time, and there's good chemistry between them (although it would have been nice to see more interplay between Stiller and Garofalo, who have been close friends in real life for a long time).Bottom line is this You won't be offended by much in Mystery Men (unless you can't stomach fart jokes), but your mind won't be terribly stimulated, either. All in all, it's a fair-to-middling kind of movie - the kind that makes you feel a little unsatisfied when it's over, like maybe it didn't quite fulfill its potential.

But no, this movie isn't rocket science humor, and I don't think it ever claimed to be.The seven MMs themselves were, in my opinion, a completely delicious treat.  The terribly mysterious Sphinx made me giggle as he forced his six teammates to construct for themselves impressive new superhero costumes.  Roy, aka Mr. Furious, was the only one who got on my nerves periodically, but his attempts at making relevant puns is amusing.  Eddie, the Shoveler, is the team's most sensible member, and the dialogue he shares with his long-suffering wife is a lot of fun.  (If anybody pukes in my swimming pool, I'm divorcing you.  That's fair.)  The gaseous Spleen and the much-ignored Invisible Boy (Dad, I'm going to my room with three strange men I just met) are edged just slightly into the background, but they are eventually treated as vital team members, and they are sometimes very vital to the humor.My two favorites were Carol, the Bowler, and Jeffrey, the Blue Raja.  I hope that if there's a MM sequel, these two get together.  Carol is the only superhero who possesses something in the way of an actual genuine power -- her dead father's head encased in a bowling ball delivers deadly strikes to his daughter's foes.  Blue Raja (who I thought was just adorable) is slowly learning the virtues of accuracy as he flings his forks.  He has some of my favorite lines in the whole film. (May the forks be with us!

The movie suffers the most from Monica, apparently played as a store mannequin.  Fortunately, the director had the skill to work around her enormous weaknesses.  The villain, Casanova Frankenstein, is a lesson in how to do a real melodramatic bad guy.  The Sphinx is the best spoof I've ever seen of the wise sage character.  And The Bowler is the best supporting female I've seen in an action movie in years.

I, for one, am glad to see Hank Azaria (The Blue Raja) get to strut his stuff in front of the camera for a change. And the rest of the cast was terrific. With Bill Macy, Ben Stiller, Janeane Garofalo, Paul Ruebens, Geoffrey Rush and Wes Studi, this has to be the coolest, and most eclectic, cast in recent movie history. What's more, each cast member is given enough screen time to showcase their formidable comic talents. Ben Stiller is especially funny as Mr. Furious. And after seeing Bill Macy as The Shoveler, I had to ask myself Is there nothing this man cannot do? He does comedy (Mystery Men), Drama (Boogie Nights) and twisted suspense (Fargo), all with equal aplomb. This is definitely one of the most underrated actors in all of Hollywood.As for the rest of the cast, well, who doesn't love Janeane? And Wes Studi is a riot dispensing questionable, albeit well meaning, advice as The Sphinx. Paul Ruebens' turn as The Spleen is nothing if not nauseatingly funny. And, surprisingly, Kel Mitchell holds his own against this talented cast.The casting of Greg Kinnear as the sold-out, egotistical Captain Amazing was flawless. The only cast member who actually seems wasted here is Rush, who, as supervillain Cassanova Frankenstein, is not nearly as over the top funny as he could have been. Blame this on a script that doesn't give him much to work with, though. At any rate, this is a very enjoyable movie with some tremendously funny scenes and well worth it for anyone just looking to escape for a couple of hours.

Suppose Lois Lane tolerated his Superman persona only because she fell in love with Clark. If that premise appeals to you, you'll probably love Mystery Men.  You can call this a parody, but in a way it really is a fantasy super-hero, action-adventure film with a lot of heart.Our heroes have a few marginally superior abilities and a compulsive-obsessive determination to fight evil.  Virtue triumphs and courage conquers, but it's very, very difficult.  They endure a lot of pain, defeat, failure, fear, uncertainty, and humiliation before achieving any success.  Teamwork is crucial, and where there is a team, there is bickering among teammates.  All of this makes them more inspiring than Superman or Power Rangers, because they push themselves to face the challenges despite having at best only slightly better resources than real-life people.As for the kind of self-assured, extraordinarily competent, typical movie super-hero, there is Captain Amazing.  I don't want to give away too much, but let's say there's a modern variation on the classic theme of the price of hubris as well as a refreshingly logical twist on super-hero plot setups and outcomes.The movie is funny, but rarely hilarious.

They try to actually make you laugh, instead of forcibly extracting the guffaws from your lungs with a deluge of cursing and really nasty situations. Aside from The Spleen, there's nary a toilet joke in sight. There's also little or no cursing, one character visibly restrains himself in order to say butt. The one-liners are real live jokes, not formulaic insults.In Champion City, superheroes are an accepted fact of life. However, not all superheroes graduated at the top of the class. The Shoveler wields his shovel with unparalleled skill. The Blue Raja , self proclaimed master of cutlery, flings forks at enemies. The Spleen is armed with his mighty flatulence. Invisible Boy can *probably* become invisible. The Bowler is aided by a bowling ball inhabited by the spirit of her dead father. Mr. Furious gets really, really angry. The terribly mysterious Sphinx coaches the team with profound koans.But when the great Captain Amazing is captured by the recently paroled Casanova Frankenstein, it's up to our heroes to save the day. So begins the ride that is Mystery Men. The script goes after comic book cliches with a zeal that may overwhelm the movie at times, but it's all in good fun Comic books have always been like this, and Mystery Men is the first one that refuses to take itself (or let itself be taken) seriously. It even looks like a comic book The environments are gothic and angular while borrowing its printed brothers' glaring color. Imagine the set design of Tim Burton while drunk.The movie does have a few too many slow moments (Is there a reason for Claire Forlani to even be *in* this movie?), and might be less enjoyable to those with little knowledge of comic books (who would probably miss a few of the in-jokes).

And every summer we always see these films get toasted by critics and never live up to their full potential. At the beginning of the summer, Mystery Men was shaping up to be another blockbuster film with a great cast, and we were waiting to see if it would fail or not.  Unfortunately, this clever comedy got lost in the mix of The Blair Witch Project and The Sixth Sense.  What got lost was a very clever and innovative comedy, which spoofs superhero films.The graphics in this film are great and add to the spoof.  They are very colorful and outrageous, which adds to the comic book feel of the film. It is in a futuristic setting with Captain Amazing, played by Greg Kinnear, as the protector of Champion City.  Then, there is the trio of Mr. Furious, The Shoveler and The Blue Raja, played by Ben Stiller, William H. Macy and Hank Azaria, respectively.  They are the superhero wannabes.  Things go afoul when Captain Amazing starts to lose popularity.  He has done such a good job that there are no superheroes left to take out.  Therefore, Captain Amazing sets up a plan to set his arch-nemesis, Casanova Frankenstein, played by Geoffrey Rush, free.  Chaos ensues as Casanova traps Captain Amazing and it is up to the wannabes to help Captain Amazing.  They do some recruiting and eventually add Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell), The Spleen (Paul Reubens), The Bowler (Janeane Garofalo) and The Sphinx (Wes Studi) to their team.As stated before, the cast is nothing short of excellent.  Movies can always enlist A-List celebrities, but they need to mesh in order to be successful.  In Mystery Men, the cast blends perfectly.  Ben Stiller and Janeane Garofalo are the perfect combination and they interact terrifically. Hank Azaria stands out as well as The Blue Raja, whether it be practicing his cutlery or arguing with his mother.  William H. Macy gives another strong performance as The Shoveler, and his demeanor and wit will have you chuckling throughout the film.  But perhaps the funniest performances come from Paul Reubens, a.k.a. PeeWee Herman, and Wes Studi.  Reubens plays the flatulent Spleen and Studi plays the prophetic Sphinx.  These performances are great and contrast the clever humor of the rest of the cast perfectly. Unlike Ben Stiller's last comedy, There's Something About Mary, Mystery Men is a clever and innovative comedy.  It will not have you rolling in the aisles, but you will still be impressed and laughing.Are there any problems with this film?  Of course.  This could have been a great film, but despite the two-hour length, it could have benefited by being longer.  The script is underwritten due to the great cast.  They are so funny they need more time.  Kinka Usher, the director of this film, tries to get each cast member his or her own amount of screen time, which takes away from the film.  In particular, Stiller and Macy could have used more screen time, along with Janeane Garofalo.  Despite all of this, the rest of the cast usually delivers with comedy when they are featured on screen. And the other detraction from Mystery Men is the ending.  The spoof ends in the last ten minutes.  Instead of having a spoof ending, which would have been funnier, they have a typical superhero ending.  In this case, each member of the cast gets to shine in their own particular way.  This detracts from the rest of the film considering the rest was a spoof. Overall, Mystery Men is a very enjoyable experience.  It is a spoof of not only superhero films, but also blockbusters as a whole.  This may be one of the few A-list casts that meshes together so well, so you do want to check this film out.  Unfortunately, stiff competition from films like The Blair Witch Project, The Sixth Sense and Runaway Bride will keep Mystery Men from achieving the box office results that it truly deserves.

That is not saying a whole lot. Mystery Men has one of the most underdeveloped screenplays in film history, yet at the same time manages in indulge in several very funny moments, all coming from the film's oddly acted, wonderfully portrayed characters. Obviously the filmmakers have put more time into choosing the actors to play the characters than actually developing them. But even then if you have a free ticket or are at the multiplex during discount hours, you minds well take the time to see this film, but only expect a cheap laugh or two.The plot is a Batman rip-off with the spirited heart of The Monster Squad. It opens giving us three wannabe superheros, The Blue Raja (Hank Azaria), who can throw forks really well, The Shoveler, (William H. Macy) who has the gift of digging extremely fast and accurately with shovels, and Mr. Furious, (Ben Stiller) who relies on his red hot temper to give him extraordinary man power. And then there's the cities most beloved crime fighter, Captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear), who not only works independently, but also has nothing to do with any other helper or fan of his in the city.When Captain Amazing discovers that he has no crime to fight because his talent is so effective, he decides to arrange the release of arch enemy currently being held in a high security prison; Cassanova Frankenstein (played effectively by Geoffrey Rush). When set free, however, Frankenstein arranges the capture and eventual disposal of his foe, Amazing, and leaves the city to be destroyed by evil and darkness when his plan dealing with a laser gun is put into focus.Who will save the city from depravity? The three who were once unheard of jokes soon bring together a team of crime fighters with super powers of their own The Bowler (Janeane Garofalo), who seeks revenge on one of Cassanova Frankenstein's henchmen who still lives in the 70's disco era for her fathers death, Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell of Good Burger), who thinks he can turn invisible when no one is watching him, The Spleen (Paul Reubens) a disgusting male who can pass extremely nasty smelling gas when someone pulls on his fore finger, and finally The Sphinx (Wes Studi) who is the team's mysterious and wise leader.Mystery Men has several good qualities. For instance, It has a message and a point to it. The film's production design looks like something out of a Batman movie that makes a city look immense and grand, at the same time week and inefficient. The designers create a vast, atmospheric mood throughout the film, releasing a sense of adventure and sometimes excitement. The great cast makes the movie, one with the level of accuracy of 200 Cigarettes and Ed TV. The performances were also quite the treat. It is a pleasure just perceiving these big names on the screen together.The problem comes from the severe lacking of character, mood and story development. The movie begins with a senseless action scene, never introducing any of its characters to us. The plot then jumps to problems before we have knowledge of the setting where these events are actually taking place. Even at the non-spectacular ending we have trouble understanding some of the character's action to each other, mostly because we know so little about them. I do realize this production is intended to be a comedy, and some of it is funny, but do the characters have to know so little?Kinka Usher's direction here will remain a mystery. Why would such a person let such obvious flaws pass though her finger tips and end up with such a shapeless, disorderly final production? It is easy to like Mystery Men because we like all of the people in it.

Macy and Greg Kinnear AND a concept with boundless possibilities (not-quite superheroes out to save the day when a real superhero is missing in action) you have to wonder what went wrong. Sadly, the answer is obvious enough writing and directing.Fine performances by Stiller, Garofalo, Macy and Kinnear cannot save the mediocrity of this film. Sure, there are good parts (the trashing of Rush's stretch corvette being a particular standout), but they are few and far between. Throughout most of this movie, I sat there hoping it would get better and dreading the awful truth that it never would.First time director Kinka Usher borrows too much stylistically from the Batman films, which is fine when your paying homage to Tim Burton, but is a terrible, unforgiveable mistake when it comes to Joel Schumacher. The latter director's inability to adequately capture action sequences by filming them too close is sadly apparent in Usher's mimicry during the opening scene.Then there's the writing. Bob Burden takes none of the blame as he is solely responsible for the comic book on which the movie is based. Neil Cuthbert, on the other hand, is the culprit who brings Burden's ideas to the screen. Cuthbert doesn't have any sceenwriting credits that are worth noting, and Mystery Men is no exception. Many of the jokes simply don't work. The story doesn't move along quickly enough to hold our attention, and some scenes (most notably the ones involving Tom Waits as a non-lethal arms manufacturer) seem underdeveloped, at best.As for the performances, Stiller once again delivers the goods as Mr. Furious. Equally enjoyable are Garofalo (The Bowler), Macy (The Shoveler), and Kinnear (Captain Amazing), who is the only legitimate hero of the bunch and has hilarious capitalist motivations. Sadly, good actors like Reubens and Hank Azaria are wasted on annoying characters that are beneath them. Rush, arguably the best actor in the bunch, is not over-the-top enough as the villain, Cassanova Frankenstein.Such is the failing of the movie as a whole. Not outrageous enough. If you're going to make a movie about would-be superheroes with not-so-super powers, you need to kick it up a notch into high gear on the ridiculous-o'-meter. It would have been a lot more fun that way. Instead, Mystery Men never quite gets it right. Not good enough to be good, nor bad enough to be good. Simply mediocre.

I suppose if Mitchell and Ruebens were tossed in for the kids, then the super disgusting special hyped up death scenes were for Die Hard fans?

When I watch movies, I look for a few key ingredients, such as plot, acting, and the use of digital effects.  We have all seen how special effects have inflated the egos of Hollywood, where the script is now merely an excuse to WOW people with digital effects (Godzilla, Batman and Robin).  Mystery Men is NOT one of those.This movie had some pretty cool special effects, but not over eccessive.  It fit the plot, which was very simple, yet very effective. IT's a simple story that reaches out to tell each and everyone of us something. It wasn't meant to be complex, and it wasn't meant to win an Oscar, but it definately delivers.As far as the cast, I think they did a bang up job. Each one, a wonderful actor/actress, and they way they portray their characters really makes them extremely likable.  The onscreen chemistry is wonderful.  But they make this movie work.The Mystery is....how Hollywood hasn't learned it's lesson yet. Special effects don't MAKE a movie, they only enhance it.  The outside of a car is what makes it look nice, but you can't drive it if there's nothing inside. This movie is a good example of that.  NOt too much visuals (although there is a lot, it really works with the movie) and I don't know, really, how this movie comes off as likable as it does, it just does. IT's a good movie, and I SERIOUSLY recommend it for people who enjoy to sit down and watch a good movie.  It's funny, and it's insightful, and I enjoyed every minute of it.

That is because they are stupid.  They're the same people who go see Jackie Chan movies and complain about the lack of plot.  Plot is not key to a comedy or action movie, people...it's just there to string the action or comedy sequences together.The comic intensity of the movie slows down for parts, such as Stiller's involvement with Claire Forlani's character, and the part where they rediscover teamwork.

This is one of those movies where you think, Did they actually read the script and think, wow, this is funny!? Geoffrey Rush was horribly miscast. There were several scenes that were supposed to generate laughs and everyone in the theater just sat there. There were a few funny parts but all in all, I must sadly say I can't recommend this movie. If you must see it, wait for video. One recommendation I can give is that it is totally appropriate for children (if you don't mind the Paul Reubens' character farting all the time, which I don't).

Garofolo, Macy, Reubens, Azaria, Studi... all of them turn out fantastic performances. Stiller's is slightly (mark that word, too, slightly) flat, but it can overlooked as I consider that the screenwriter's fault and not Stiller's.A few of the earlier reviewers have nailed it on the head -- either you'll get this film and laugh pretty good, or you won't, and you didn't belong going to see it in the first place.This is a movie about second-rate superheroes, and, like The Tick, it's almost a prerequisite that you have at least a little bit of superhero knowledge.

With the summer's major disappointments or not-quite-overwhelming vehicles (read Phantom Menace) mounting, I was starting to think that it might just save the summer. While it does have some really funny bits, nifty production design and a cast of seasoned comedy pros, MM is that weird film whose middle section is the strongest.

As the group builds to save the missing good Captain, so does the level of good jokes and clever jabs at superhero myths.Yet, as the film comes into final stretch and the action begins to fly the premise seems to have run out of steam. Not to mention superhero ethos targets for humor. Sometimes it seems the filmmakers can't decide if they are making a spoof of these films or not. Also, for a film that for the most part steers clear of blood much less any graphic display the producers forgot to tell the CGI team about this and one character meets a rather gruesome death. And, I really hope that now he has reached the stage that he's more or less parodying himself, Stiller will for once and for all retire the transparent angry guy routine he's been doing for years now. It was old when he did it back on Friends and it ain't getting fresher here. He and Paul Reubens were the two most irritating of the Mystery Men.

Blue Raja (Hank Azaria) fights with lethal forks. The Bowler (Jeaneane Garafolo) attacks with a skull in a bowling ball. The Shoveler (William H. Macy) duels with a, you guessed it, shovel. Kel Mitchell thinks he's The Invisible Boy. Spleen (Paul Reubens) deals silent but deadly flatulence. Last, but not least, Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller) is the most inept of all with his super-anger. The super-villain of the piece is Casanova Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush) who the real superhero, Capt. Amazing (Greg Kinnear) helps release from well-deserved incarceration. Amazing doesn't have much saving-the-day to do lately  since he has been so super-effective in his previous exploits. The ragtag group tries unsuccessfully to rescue Amazing, but need that extra special leadership that arrives under the name of Sphinx (Wes Studi).The rest is exactly what you would expect except it just goes on  too long for its own good. Most of the comedy is funny, but after a while, enough is enough. The Airplane movies and Young Frankenstein had the right idea. Present your joke and get on with it. Youngsters between the ages of 8 to 14 will probably enjoy it, but there isn't enough involvement on another level for older children and adults.

There is not a single type of joke that the makers of this film avoided; it's all there -- physical, mental, wordplay, slapstick, erudition, vulgarity -- costume jokes, word jokes, makeup jokes, posture jokes, accent jokes, set jokes, history jokes, science jokes, culture jokes, scatological jokes, even silverware jokes -- and it all works.  I haven't laughed this hard at a movie since the first time I saw Ghostbusters.The production design is magnificent.  Combined physical and computer generated sets and scenery provide the thrill of entering a complete universe that is at once slightly foreign and futuristic and yet instantly recognizable as a probable dimension of our own world.  Unlike Dick Tracy, the costumes in this movie, which is also based on a series of comics, do not look like comic-book costumes, but like things real people would actually wear.  In fact, they are real things people actually do wear.  Or have worn.There is so much to look at.  There is so much to hear.  This is  one to watch more than once, especially since you will laugh so much you will not be able to hear all the lines the first time.The things that make this movie not just a nice pastime but genuinely great are the overall message (more on that later) and the character development, which is not just provided by the script and plot, but absolutely depends on the unique performance given by each actor.  The sincerity of William H. Macy as The Shoveler is probably the deepest performance in the film, the one which really makes the audience care about not just his character, but all the others.  His earnest, serious performance, combined with the sweetness of Louise Lasser as the Blue Raja's mother, and the earthiness of the actress who plays Mrs. Shoveler (Jenifer Lewis, I think), is what keeps this movie from degenerating into just another Gen-X-ridicule-fest.As the Bowler, Janeane Garofalo perfectly plays the usual sarcastic, demented, but strangely grounded character which keeps packing us in to see her.  Hank Azaria once again displays his vocal and facial versatility both as the Blue Raja and the man behind the costume.  Ben Affleck fully inhabits the character of  Mr. Furious, who is after all just trying to learn how to become a real boy.  Kel Mitchell's Invisible Boy is heart-piercingly sweet and charming, even at his most ridiculous.  Geoffrey Rush, Tom Waits, Wes Studi and Paul Rubens -- well, let's just say no one else could possibly have played their parts.  No, really.  They have done such a good job that anyone else in any of these roles becomes inconceivable.Now, the childless group with whom I saw this film ranged in age from 31 to 38, and we laughed ourselves ill, but also thoroughly loved the movie for the story, the acting, the costumes, the sets...  Still, I would venture to suggest that you could bring a child age 8 or above to this movie and not be sorry.  I think it's the overall message which makes this film, even with all the sometimes graphic violence and frequently coarse silliness, perfectly appropriate for slightly older children.  So what about that message?  It's the very best one  Be yourself.  Accept yourself.  Respect yourself.  Follow your dreams.  Accept and respect other people and their dreams.  Do your best.  Have fun. "},{"Title":"The humor wears thin, the plot wears out.","Date":"9 August 1999","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Fantasy","Review":"  Good performances by William H.

Stiller does a nice job as Mr. Furious when he gets angry and attacks them in a silly way.  Paul Reubens is just there for more comic relief, though it's funny how he became what he is.  Kel Mitchell from All That does a nice job as Invisible Boy, but he's never given enough screen time.  Janeane Garofolo is an odd-ball herself as she uses her Bowling Ball with her Father's skull.  Captain Amazing doesn't get much screen time (I hate that).  Geoffrey Rush on the other hand plays a charismatic Casanova Frankenstein  (Which the Casanova part is fitting).  The Sphinx is okay.  The insane part is his Disco Henchmen, they're funny, though I would like it if they attacked our heroes with boogie moves.The dialogue... It ranges from many super hero ploys to ridiculing comments.  That of the likes of Mr. Furious, when he gets mad he just gives away he'll puff up like a ball of rage.  The Raja's accent gives also a certain twist into the line, and Garofalo's speaking with her dead father gives more insanity to the show.All in all, Mystery Men is a nice movie that shouldn't be passed out.

The whole movie is a parody of every other superhero movie without delving into the totally absurd, and losing its identity and staying with the superhero schtick.  It works for this movie because of the insight and humor that everybody has brought into this movie.  It seems as if the person who wrote this either hates superhero comics or movies, or loves them and wants to make them more realistic.  The movie should be a must see if you have seen the Batman and Superman movie series, and have spotted any imperfections or absurdities in them.Plot  Champion City's main superhero, Captain Amazing, is kidnapped by a supervillain he has just freed, Cassanova Frankenstein.  As a result, the city's lesser--much, much lesser--superheroes try to rescue him.  They also recruit superheroes for the job.  The original group is The Blue Raja, who uses forks and spoons, The Shoveler, and is led by Mr. Furious, who isn't that threatening.  They recruit The Spleen, who farts, Invisible Boy, who can only be invisible when no one, including himself, looks, and The Bowler, who uses a bowling ball with her Dad's skull in it.  The find the mysterious Sphinx who trains them.  They also find a weapons dealer who makes non-lethal weapons such as the blame thrower.  Very funny plot, and original killers, or at least for the comic book.Acting  These people are great.  They know what their role should be, and run with it.  I love how they never quite vary from their given role. The dialogue is quite dry and sarcastic, even when it does not mean to be. The whole script is inventive and biting.  Very good work.Presentation  Just like a Batman movie.  Dark and heavy with undertones. The production values are high, but they need to be to make the movie effective.  The Special effects are great and the whole overall feeling of the movie is pure genius.  Albeit, there are a couple of slow spots, but they do not last for long and they are somewhat necessary.This movie should be on everybody's summer movie hit list.  It mocks all other superhero movies which generally are released in the summer.  This is a winner and it should be.

Without much to do, I'd spend a lot of time drawing or reading comic books.  Some of the first words I learned to read were in old issues of Action Comics.Superhero movies have always been something of a draw for me, and most of them have been disappointments.  With the exception of the first two Superman films, and the first Batman, the field has been littered with the corpses of the dead...witness Batman and Robin, and the dreadfully awful Superman IV - The Quest for Peace.  So, it was with much trepidation that I went to see Mystery Men, a comedy that makes fun of the conventional superhero mythos of old.  The most surprising thing about the film?I actually liked it.Now, don't get me wrong, I have no illusions that this film will be the next Titanic, or reach the dizzying heights of popularity of Blair Witch, or the Star Wars films.  Mystery Men is a modest creation, one with much quiet subtlety, even among it's obvious toilet humor.  I mean, hey, any movie that features Paul Reubens (Pee-Wee Herman) as a flatulent superhero with an Eek the Cat-lisp has GOT to be worth a look-see.The film's weakest point is in it's story.  The same old tired tale of the underdogs saving the day has been done to death, especially in our cynical age.  However, Mystery Men does it with such loving care and aplomb that you can't help but admire it's tenacity.  Sure, it's obvious and mostly crude, but that happens to be part of it's charm.  The dialogue and sight gags are delivered with such simplicity and subtlety that it almost seems natural.  These guys really DO act like second-rate superheroes, and we really want them to succeed.  The problem is, even when they succeed, the film fails to generate much excitement.  Chalk it up to the delivery, and not the the individual performances.  The director and screenwriter are at fault here in not living up to our expectations of what this concept and cast are capable of.Kudos to the cast for a job well done, applause and hurrahs to the effects and design crew, and smiles and cheers to the original creators of this concept...a bunch of guys who read too many comic books.  The director and writer of the film will undoubtedly be remembered for other things, hopefully, but this film will probably be forgotten.  See it to watch some of the funniest bits you will ever see in a superhero flick, but don't see it expecting to be amazed, astounded and astonished.  There is none of that here.  However, it IS a good waste of a Sunday afternoon.Meanwhile, I'll go back to reading my comic books.

Last weekend I watched the FX channel's marathon of the Ben Stiller Show; it was absolutely hilarious.  The comic genious of both Ben Stiller and Janine Garafolo was as apparent as the sun in the sky.  Afterwards, I couldn't wait to see Mystery Men; I couldn't wait to see these great comedians in a satirical superhero movie.  Well I saw it last night, and I must say I was disappointed. Don't get me wrong, the cast was terrific.  Geoffrey Rush was great as Cassanova Frankenstein, the film's icy villain.  The Shoveler (played almost seriously by the great William H. Macy) stood as a stark contrast to the child-like Spleen (the former Pee-wee Herman, Paul Reubens) and Kel Mitchell's Invisible Boy (who can only become invisible when nobody is looking).  Janine Garafolo played her usual character (which has not yet worn thin), and Ben Stiller really shined through as Mr. Furious the angry leader who is as cynical as we would be in that particular world.  Let's not forget Hank Azaria who sounds a great deal like James Mason in Kubrick's Lolita.  Anyway, a lot of jokes (and I'll get back to the jokes later) were situated within the audiences' knowledge of comic books and comic book movies.  For example, Captain Amazing's (Greg Kinnear) alter ego, Lance, simply wears a suit and glasses a la Clark Kent, and no one seems to really notice (except Mr. Furious but nobody else believes it).The movie itself looked like Joel Schumaker's wet dream.  It was a living comic book  with a set right out of Batman and Robin.  Unlike Batman and Robin though, this movie was in on the joke just as Army of Darkness was. But I digress... The director used a great deal of weird angle shots from weird positions just as artists use in comic books - overhead shots, ultra low angle shots, etc.  It worked in this film because it was supposed to be a moving comic book.  The shots were necessary.  If the film took itself seriously, the shots would be extraneous and thus, stupid.Here's where the film fell apart it was boring.  I don't mean it was boring all the way through, but there were a good deal of sections that I just felt like leaving.  The first of these was the first scene where Mr. Furious, The Shoveler, and the Blue Raja were in the diner.  It was too long.  The bickering between the Mystery Men also lasted too long, as did their training with the Sphynx.  They could have cut a good twenty minutes off of the running time.Back to the jokes.  Some (and I do stress some) of the jokes were really funny.  Some got a good chuckle.  Most of them were not at all funny.  I understand that a lot of jokes in comic books are not funny, but movies, no matter how hard you try, are not comic books.  They should have made the movie funny.  They needed good jokes instead of the supposed-to-be-cheezy one liners of serious superhero movies.  THis movie is a parody - they should have stretched it to the limits to make it truly hilarious.  The bottom line - the movie falls apart because of the script, and it is a serious detriment to the rest of the film.

What we were privileged to was a group of average Joes giving their all in order to gain our love and respect.  This is what Mystery Men is all about.Central City's main superhero, Captain Amazing, has been kidnapped, and it is up to this band of wannabes to free him.

Macy, Ben Stiller, Hank Azaria, Janeane Garofalo, Geoffrey Rush, and the roster continues.  The chemistry amongst the cast is on.  There has always been a connection between Stiller and Garofalo, but consider Macy and Stiller.  The perpetual neurotic and the stoic every-man.  How about Azaria and Garofalo.  The less that masculine man and the more than a man woman.  It's the little things like this that allow this movie to work.Either many of the scenes were improvised, or the script was pure comedy.  Some of Ben Stiller's lines as Mr. Furious are so absurd (anybody that can say I'm a ticking time bomb of fury with a straight face gets a nod from me).  Yet, lines like So, do we save Captain Amazing, or do I eat this sandwich? fit well into the bizarrely constructed world our replacement heroes inhabit.  Each hero, by nature, is a walking idiosyncrasy.  A guy that throws cutlery around while wearing an old carpet for a cape and talks with a fake British accent I think that's how Webster defines camp.In closing I have one last thought.  This movie almost feels like a live action version of The Tick.  It has the same random humor combined with an attempt at demystifying the archetype of the &#145;super hero.'  Plus, Mystery Men has a deranged Janeane Garofalo talking to a bowling ball that contains the skull of her murdered father.  It don't get much more surreal than that.

Each actor is perfectly cast.  Ben Stiller is great as Mr. Furious.  All he does it get mad, and he's a bit ineffectual.  Hank Azaria is perfectly prissy as The Blue Raja and William H. Macy is at his square jawed best as The Shoveler, and man who shovels really well.  Greag Kinnear is perfectly pompous as Captain Amazing, and Geoffrey Rush seemed to be having fun in the role of disco loving Cassanova Frankenstein.  A very funny movie that skewers the superhero genre that is helped along the way by a good cast of eccentric characters, good action and a really unique visual style.

This turned out to be a clever spoof of just about every comic book movie that has ever been made beginning with Superman and ending with The Avengers.  The plot was basically the same as every other movie like this one but there were a few interesting and at times hilarious twists.  The major reason to see this movie is its incredible cast.  The two Oscar nominees, Geoffrey Rush and Greg Kinnear, turn in great supporting performances as Cassanova Frankenstein, the evil villain, and Captain Amazing, the over-endorsed superhero of Champion City, respectively.  Even in a rather ridiculous film like this one, Rush manages to shine.  Then we have the Mystery Men themselves, a rag tag group of wannabe heroes who set out to save Captain Amazing and Champion City from the clutches of Cassanova Frankenstein.  Heading them up is the unimpressive Ben Stiller as Mr. Furious.  He wasn't funny, and he didn't even have a real super power.  He was just annoying. Next is Hank Azaria as the Blue Raja.  Now here was spoofing at its best.  The Raja's talent is hurling his mother's cutlery while speaking in a British accent.  Add the fact that Hank Azaria himself can be like a living cartoon and you just have to smile.  Then there's William H. Macy, an every may, good husband, good father, but with a special talent; he shovels very well, hence his name, the Shoveler.  Paul Reubens plays Pee Wee Herman with and awful lisp and a deadly flatulence problem, but he's still hilarious.  I still don't know who Invisible Boy was played by or why he was in this movie so I'll move on.  Last, but certainly not least there is the Bowler played by Janeane Garofalo.  I never cease to get a kick out of Janeane Garofalo and this movie is no exception.  Her dry humor and rapier wit invigorate this movie just when you think it isn't going to be any good... even if her character talks to her dead father whose skull she keeps in her bowling ball.  Garofalo even manages to make something that dumb funny.  It was over-long and overblown, but it's better than any of the other action films you'll see coming from the summer of 99.  So see it.  You'll laugh.  "},{"Title":"Only one problem","Date":"7 August 1999","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Fantasy","Review":"  I loved Mystery Men.

They'll think this movie is intended to make fun of superheroes while in actuality, it is a celebration of them. By turning the conventions of a superhero comic on its side, Bob Burden's Mystery Men show not only everything that is, admittedly, silly about superheroes, but it shows everything that is right about them as well, not to mention everything they could be. For people who actually love comic books, as I do, this movie is a godsend.

Much like the comic book The Tick, there's a certain non-sequitous humor that either taps into your collective subconscious funny bone or doesn't. Unlike the Mel Brooks parodies, which keep getting more specific and detailed in their mockery while growing less funny with each project, Mystery Men is up there with Blazing Saddles in its day - a good overall spoof of its genre. From its stylized cityscapes, at once attractive in their own right, but also drawing a mocking parallel to the typical neo-modern superhero Gotham or Metropolis, to the inevitable lame origin story most superheroes borne of the 60's and 70's have, to the untouchable cast...this movie is thoroughly enjoyable - If you have the offbeat wit required to get it. The things most people have criticized stem from their not understanding the comic book hero conventions and this movie's glee in warping them while paying homage to them. Yes, Geoffrey Rush's brilliantly eccentric and creepy Cassanova Frankenstein's plan is nebulous - what epic supervillain's isn't? The cast is at the top of their respective games here Macy is brilliant as the earnest everyman who believes in his talents, his delivery worth the price of admission alone. Stiller gives one of his best, edgiest performances to date. Hank Azaria successfully continues his unheralded quest to be the best character actor in the country. Jeanine Garafolo is even funny when she is just talking to a bowling ball. Paul Reubens is my only disappointment - he's great, don't get me wrong; but the voice is a little too annoying to maintain without grating on you. Unfortunately, the nerdy Pee Wee voice would have fit the character perfectly, and I'm sure that's what he wanted to shy away from. Wes Studi's Sphinx is a deadpan zen riot, Tom Waits is quirkily amusing, and Greg Kinnear's only flaw was not enough screen time.The movie is empirically funny. If you have the twisted wit to get it.

The characters were very well casted for this movie especially Hank Azaria who plays the Blue Raja.  His faux-british accent is way up to par.

Unfortunately this means he can't cash in on lucrative endorsement deals anymore, so he has to engineer a super-villain's (Casanova Frankenstein)'release' from an asylum. However, he miscalculates Frankenstein's abilities and ends up captured. Enter OUR HEROES, the fringe 'super' heroes who existed solely in Captain Amazing's shadow.

They go on a journey of self-discovery blah blah and save the day.If you don't know anything about comics, I'm certain the movie had some occasional bright spots marred by what seems to be idiotic dialog and plot conventions. But if you ARE a drooling fanboy then there's a horde of in-jokes about the eternal cliche's of the comic book world. There are so many flaws in the film that can be seen either as what was he thinking? or ho ho! just like the comic books! (for example, every time a new 'hero' is introduced the narrative stops dead so they can relate their SUPER SECRET ORIGIN, or at least give the appearance of doing so). Unfortunately I can't go into specifics without giving anything away about the film itself, but suffice it to say most of the excuses for character development you've seen in Marvel/CD comics appear in this film, although they are (hopefully) tongue in cheek.Lastly I'd like to say some of the more over-the-top characters in this film probably owe an honorary debt to Ben Edlund's THE TICK, easily the bestest ridicule/super hero comic I've ever seen.Rating for people who don't know comics  Average to sub Average Rating for people who do know comics     Good to Very Good "}{"Title":"Super-heroics and comedy make for an excellent mix.","Date":"28 July 1999","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Fantasy","Review":"  I was fortunate to catch the advance screening of this movie on July 28, and I am pleased to say that I was very satisfied.

I'm not sure about how a mass audience will feel about Mystery Men, but I found it to be very clever, funny and immensely likable.What a cast, too.

It's rather strange on how to descrbie it.  But if I have to compare it to another film, then it's Tim Burton's BATMAN and Ridley Scott's BLADE RUNNER meets the Farley brother's DUMB & DUMBER. It's a film with excellent sets, costumes, and backgrounds mixed with outrageous humor.  And with that, I thought it was a excellent film! The plot is set in a Metropolis/Gotham City like city called Champion City.  While Metropolis has Superman and Gotham has Batman, Champion has Captain Amazing (Greg Kinner).  And instead of Captain Amazing being like Superman, and just wanting to fight crime for truth, justice, and the American way, he instead fights crime for publicity.  When Captain Amazing is being told that some of the sponsors he wears on his super-suit are pulling out from sponsoring him due to lack of crime-fighting.  Amazing decides to set free one of his most notorious rivals free from the insane asylum, Dr. Cassanova Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush).  Meanwhile, there are three superhero wanna-be's who would like to fight crime also, sadly they just don't have the luck.  One is Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller), the other is the Shoveler (William H. Macy), and the third is the Blue Raja (Hank Azaria).  They would like to assist Captain Amazing and become superhero's themselves, however they need more practice.  When Dr. Frankensein kidnaps Captain Amazing, that is the calling card of the three wannabes to set fourth, save their superhero and their city.  So they recruit some more people with so-called super powers.  The Bowler (Janeane Garofalo), the Spleen (Paul Rubens), Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell), and the Sphinx (Wes Studi).  From there on is a non-stop film with laughs and fun. I couldn't really know on what to think about MYSTERY MEN, after first watching it.  But now I realized that it is a clever and intellegent satire of the comic book stories that many of us grew up with.  It is indeed funny at times, and at other times, it gets weird.  But it never gets dull or boring throughout the movie, and I was glad of that. I thought the sets were amazing in the HAUNTING, but now I think the HAUNTING looks plain compared to the sets of MYSTERY MEN.  The sets for MYSTERY MEN were outstanding!!  Mixing it with BATMAN and BLADE RUNNER and Terry Gilliam's BRAZIL, it's some of the most fantastic sets that I have ever seen!  I would be disappointed if it doesn't win a Oscar. The acting in this film is also quite good.  Rush, Kinner, Studi, Rubens, and Azaria all do a good job in their roles.  However the three that stood out were Macy, Stiller, and Garofalo.  Garofalo is particularly good as the smarty Bowler who is heroic, yet has a smart alec attitude and talks to her bowling ball with the skull of her dead father's head. Overall, MYSTERY MEN is a delightful treat, a great tounge-in-cheek homage to the classic superhero comics that we all grew up on, mixed with plot twists and modern humor.  I think those who love comic books or comic style movies will love this movie like I did.  However, those who are expecting just a comedy will probably not like it that much.  But I highly enjoyed it and think it's one of the best films this year!  I'm hoping that first time director Kinka Usher is planning on doing a follow-up to MYSTERY MEN, because it would be fun to see these wannbe super heros again fighting for justice.

I'm not sure why this is the case but regardless I sat to the film with no prejudgement about what I would be getting. The film is a good central idea and as such produces plenty of amusing and interesting moments that spoof the idea of superheroes and the conventions of the Hollywood movies. The plot is nonsense but it takes the usual devices of training, the gang coming together and so on to string it together. The problem I had was that the film was far too long and thus had many, many scenes that felt baggy, didn't add value or were just not funny at all. It is a shame because it is the type of thing that needed to be brisk, tight and funny to be really successful.The cast certainly offer much on paper but the material and running time leave them without too many great moments to share out. Azaria, Stiller and Macy lead the cast with good characters but never really meet their potential. Rush is an OK villain but focuses on the crazy rather than criminal part of his character. Garofalo is cool and fits her character while smaller supporting turns are mostly good from Waits, Forlani, Kinnear, Studi, Jay, Mitchell and Izzard amongst a few others. The fact that nobody is brilliant is unfortunately down to the material, rather than anyone here.Overall then an amusing idea with some laughs but the material is nowhere near strong enough to hold up the baggy running time.

I would recommend watching it, not because it is a good movie with a good plot, but because it makes fun of good movies with good plots and that makes it funny...

The best dialogue in the movie comes from the personalities of the actors themselves. This is the kind of movie that is best to watch on video with your remote in hand to fast-forward through the boring parts.The story Captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear), the hero of Champion City has cleaned up the city of crime and his sponsers are getting restless for something new. He comes up with the idea of paroling his nemesis Dr. Casanova Frankenstein (that it NOT a typo) so that the doctor can cause some crime, the Captain can save the day and have his rep restored.The problem is that Frankenstein kidnaps the Captain. So it's up a band of second rate superheroes to spring into action. They include Mr. Furious (Ben Stiller) who 'gets Pompeii' when there is trouble; The blue raja (Hank Azaria) who hurls forks and spoon (His partners helpfully suggest that he try wearing blue instead lime green) and The Shoveler (William H. Macy) who fights with garden tools.When they see their opportunity to make a name for themselves they assign new team members which include The Bowler (Janaene Garofalo) who hurls mean bowling ball which contains her late father's skull, Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell) who can only turn invisible when no one is looking and The Spleen (Paul Reuben) who . . . um . . . well . . . vents it. My favorite though is The Sphinx (Wes Studi) a Zen Yoda-like trainer who dispenses hilarious saying like 'You must be a wolf pack, not a six pack' and 'You must lash out with every limb like an octopus who plays the drums' There are long stretches of dead screen time with no laughs. The fight scenes have a lot of energy dispensed with little payoff. The major scenes involving the special effects don't work.I wish that the movie had kept it simple. There are a lot of small moments in this movie that are brilliant. I especially liked Macy's line 'We've got a date with destiny and it looks like she's ordered the lobster'. I loved an early recruitment scene, which includes characters like The Waffler (who fights with waffle irons) and The PMS Avenger (who only works once a month).A curious thing happens when people talk about a movie like 'Mystery Men'. They will tell you what was wrong with it but then quickly tell you about a scene that works. This is the kind of middle-of-the-row comedy that people defend but do not endorse.

But I do try and watch superhero films, and the synopsis of this one sounded interesting, to say the least a group of would-be crime-fighters, with pathetic superpowers, attempt to beat an arch villain. There's a premise with potential, if nothing else.Sadly, what I ended up watching was a heavily sanitised Hollywood film with an oh-so predictable outcome that by working together and putting faith in each other, this rag-tag group of misfits can end up winning the day. Literally every step of the film is signposted from the beginning, from Stiller's tired romance with an extraneous Claire Forlani to the bad guy's plans for world domination. Even worse, the humour sucks. One guy is flatulent, another guy thinks he's invisible when he's not, and the wit never goes any deeper than that.I realised, in the end, that I was watching a kid's film made on a totally undemanding level. It's a shame, because there are some fine actors appearing here, not least William H. Macy, Janeane Garofalo, Geoffrey Rush and Wes Studi, but in the end MYSTERY MEN is cheesy, dated and dull. It took another 11 years for a film to put some real bite into a superhero parody watch KICK-ASS to see how this should have been done.

Not only do I splash out at Virgin's 5 for £30 deal but I also seem to have spent nearly all of my Blockbuster credit on ex-rental DVDs. So many movies to watch in so little time. And still feeling dirty and depressed after viewing Die Hard 2 (which is soon to be exchanged), I felt like a little light relief was needed so I watched something I'd been meaning to watch for some time - Mystery Men. Sadly, the relief was all too light and like The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen, this is a pleasant enough waste of time but doesn't live up to the killer premise.In far away Champion City, crime has been virtually eliminated by crime-fighting superhero Captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear), meaning that he was little to do but appear in commercials and push autograph hunters aside. Then he has an idea - arrange his arch-nemesis Casanova Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush) to escape from his asylum and beat him all over again, to boost his fading profile. Unfortunately, Frankenstein is a masterful evil genius and has soon captured Captain Amazing, meaning that nobody is there to save the city from imminent destruction. Nobody except the worst bunch of superhero-wannabes imaginable, from Mr Furious (Ben Stiller) to the Shoveller (William H Macy). Aided by an invisible boy who is only invisible when nobody is looking (Kel Mitchell) to a bowling-ball wielding woman on a quest for revenge (Janeane Garofalo), the team of hopeless losers begin their mission to rescue the real superhero and defeat Casanova once and for all.Like I said, it's a great idea for a film but something is lacking here. Certainly not the enthusiasm from the actors, most of whom are pretty good if not totally believable in their roles. Probably the best of the bunch is Macy, who has that brilliant look of world-weariness as his despairing wife can't understand her husband's determination to be a superhero. Rush and Eddie Izzard (as his disco-dancing accomplice) have little to do but both have such ridiculous accents that it's impossible to take them seriously. Actually, why should any of this be taken seriously? It's as disposable as a plastic cup and it couldn't be a bigger mickey-take if it tried and this is one of the problems. Superhero movies are all the same anyway, in terms of structure, story and finale. And sadly, Mystery Men sticks doggedly to the formula. It raises a few smirks now and again but this isn't the hilarious film that it might have been.I'm not really a hardcore comic fan but I imagine most readers of Spiderman or whatever might be pretty offended by this. OK, maybe not as offended if they'd watched Daredevil but this is one of the most hypocritical movies I've ever seen. Whilst denouncing superhero movies as dumb and clichéd, Mystery Men pulls back its mask and reveals itself to be a dumb and clichéd superhero movie. This could have been brilliant (as, indeed, could LXG) but it falls apart quicker than Michael Jackson's defence team. For a real superhero movie, watch Spiderman 2 or even The Incredibles because this is a long way off those heights. Never mind... I also picked, among others, X-Men 2 and I'm willing to bet that film will be much better than this one. This is a terrible waste of a great idea, yet again.

The first time I saw the movie I wasn't overly impressed. But with subsequent viewings I find it grows on you more and more.One of the greatest things any movie can do is to plant a catch-phrase or line of dialogue in your head. Whether it's Caveman's Tonda or The Princess Bride's Inconceivable, these movies manage to plant this word or phrase and then you just can't get it out of your head. With Mystery Men you get two phrases planted, though phrase is a poor choice of words. Let's say you get two concepts. The first is Mr Angry's broken sentencing describing what's happening to himself - Vision dimming......blood draining.......consciousness failing! kind of comment. The second is down to The Sphinx, who's pearls of wisdom amount to little more than common sense wrapped up in a mystical phrase You must master your fears, or your fears will master you!These comments I'll never get out of my head and show that the movie had an impact on me. All too often I watch a film and then can't remember much about it after a few hours. Mystery Men at least has left me with (a mostly useless) legacy of itself in those comments.As to the film itself you can do far worse. The drawing point here is that all the superheroes are completely inept and hardly super at all. In fact, only a few of them really have any powers at all. The Invisible Boy who can only become invisible when no-one is watching. Mr Angry, who , for virtually the whole movie, really only pretends to be a tower of rage. The Spleen, who has noxious farts etc. You get the idea. Of course, in the end, their powers prove just the right mix to get the job done.The movie is harmless fun and is a refreshing change from the serious, angst-ridden superhero movies we're seeing today. A very refreshing change.If you were disappointed by the likes of Daredevil and Spiderman and The Hulk, then give this one a whirl. It's a lot more fun.

Yes. Funny? Very.If you didn't find it so, keep an open mind while reading the rest of this review, because you're not likely to agree with anything else I say here.Mystery Men is one of the strongest entries into a film genre known as 'stupid humour'. (a-la Monty Python) You laugh because it's so outrageous and unbelievable, it's funny. Many people just don't 'get' this sort of humour, and that's OK. (incidentally, the secret to enjoying this kind of humour is to not try to understand it, and just go along with it) But even those who do not usually like this kind of humour should still be blown away by this film. Mystery Men was exactly what it wanted to be, which is outrageous, original and enormously funny on the way.The plot, which is spontaneous and very original, mocks all the clichéd superhero films we know and love. I won't reveal it here, but rest assured you'll never view a 'serious' superhero movie the same way again!This movie has one of the most incredible casts in film history, (which is kind of surprising, considering it had a first time director and no script tagged onto it) with big names like Geoffrey Rush, Lena Olin, William H. Macy, Greg Kinnear and Eddie Izzard popping up as well as other well known actors like Ben Stiller, Hank Azaria, Janeane Garofalo, Wes Studi and Claire Forlani. Everyone in this movie did a great job, there was absolutely no bad acting whatsoever. (I think that's the first time I've ever been able to say that and actually mean it!) Particular standing out performances were Geoffrey Rush as devious-yet-charming borderline OTT German villain Casanova Frankenstein, and Hank Azaria as the fork-flinging Blue Raja who would love to be British. The incredibly plastic faced Greg Kinnear as mock superhero Captain Amazing and Janeane Garofalo as the sarcastic Bowler also both did great jobs, but as I said earlier, there was no one who gave what you would call a 'bad' performance. Even the extras showed competent acting skills, which is definitely a first.Kinka Usher, with his feature film directorial debut, does prove to be a slightly shaky director, but with the help of the totally inspired cast, he pulls it off OK. Apparently, there was no official script for the film (there was a storyline, but all exact dialogue was invented by the actors, and changed as they went along - an excellent way for the actor to get in touch with their character!) but there were so many great lines that you would never have guessed so. The sets were completely inspired, and added to the humour of the film - you'd start with a 50's ish diner, than move on to Chinese and Mexican buildings almost immediately next door. This is a way of parodying the merging of different cultures in the States, exaggerated terribly so the audience gets the point. (or so we would hope!) The movie's music was also very good, adding to the superhero-parody mood.This is one of my favorite movies of all time, due to it's sheer originality and great acting, and the fact that it has some of the most spontaneous and original humour in film history. Please don't miss Mystery Men! (especially for Monty Python fans! This is a very similar type of humour) It will completely revolutionize your way of thinking!

Greg Kinnear plays Captain Amazing, more or less copied off of Batman, he benefits from the comical stupidity of villains, he has an incredibly obvious alter-ego personality who's a billionaire, etc. When Captain Amazing's nemesis captures him, it's up to a group of 2nd-rate superheroes to save the city, played by an ensemble of underrated stars (Well, these days Ben Stiller might be classified as overrated, as he's played the same exact role in Along Came Polly, Duplex, Meet the Parents, AND Starsky and Hutck, but this was back in 1999, so back then this Mr Furious kind of persona, was original for him).Underneath the surface of this movie is kind of a postmodern superhero movie, echoed by the setting, which reminds me of a rust belt city, an aging town marked by decaying downtowns, abandoned amusement parks, a general lack of vibrancy and youth, but a clear picture that the city, was once long ago important. Similarly, the heroes in this movie are people who grew up watching those famous heroes Batman, Superman, Wonderwoman, etc, and are trying to invent catchy names and themes for themselves, and struggle to define themselves in an original way. Of course, as we see in the scene where the Mystery Men are cornered into a back alley by some thugs and start laughing at the thugs for being too cliched in their choice of weapons and costumes before getting the crap beaten out of them, the heroes eventually realize that they have to actually be able to fight in addition to having cool costumes.However, out of all this comes a moral, which comes to Ben Stiller's character, Mr. Furious, who tries with no luck to pick up a waitress at a diner by impressing her with his superhero persona. For example, he talks about how dangerous the city is and suggests he walk her home because she might need protection, which she obviously doesn't buy. The waitress (Claire Folani) eventually starts liking him, but she plays pretty hard to get, and he only starts getting anywhere with her when he drops the superhero persona and starts being his self, and that's kind of the moral, which i think is a little more all-encompassing than this film. It's all about growing up with certain role models and becoming dissapointed about not living up to them. The other moral kind of comes out of William H. Macy's pep talk when everyone decides to give up, and he establishes that #1, we're not really the best heroes in the world, and #2, however, we are the only guys who can do the job and whether we accept it or not, it's up to us to stop the villain. This kind of touches up on the idea that no one really is asked to be a hero, sometimes they just have a job to do.Anyway, I think this movie in addition to being both intelligent and hilarious, is really fresh and original. If you've read through this review, and are thinking huh?, you'll know what I'm talking about, cause just the main idea and so much else in the film are really just so far out there compared to so much else.

I happen to hate these types of people who stick their noses up at a good old-fashioned hilarious movie. There are a number of problems with the film. People could grow irksome of the characters; more specifically Claire Forlani's who is totally unnecessary. They could find the movie downright stupid, but I happened to love it. 	The characters, who some may find annoying as previously mentioned, truly make the movie. Janeane Garofalo's character, the bowler, is truly quirky and terribly funny. Nearly ever line she delivers brings a wave of laughter over the audience. The `There isn't enough beer in the world' line and many others shall be remembered for a long time to come. Not only this but her relationship with her father, bowling ball, skull or whatever it is is just another comical thing to be pointed out. Though these factors alone could make for a hilarious movie, the interaction between the characters make it that much better. The constant bickering between Stiller and Garofalo's characters seems to never get old and only funnier each time it happens. Macy's character, the shoveler, does a wonderful job of the husband trying passively to deal with his overbearing wife, Lucille. Azaria and his character's mother do this type of comical inter-household relationship very well. The one onscreen relationship, which was not terribly appealing or funny, was that of Stiller and Forlani. The obligatory love interest seemed to fall very short this time around. Forlani is a very talented actress and she does probably the best job possible considering her given role, but this one seems impossible to make anything of. She was a superfluous character from the get go and there was not much that she could do about it. But like I said, she is a very talented actress and her flawed character goes virtually unnoticed to many thanks to this fact. Almost all of the minor flaws in Mystery Men go unnoticed thanks to many things, the good acting, the witty one-liners, the quirky characters, and much more. True, this is not Oscar caliber stuff, but was it ever meant to be? To all of you out there with nothing better to do than write bad reviews for fun summer flicks (to go along with your probably bad sense of humor), just sit back and let the movie do what it was supposed to be doing all along, entertain you.

Clocking in at an outrageous and deadly 123 minute running time, this film, like so many before it, demonstrates the futility of trying to lampoon a category of film that, in its purest form, comes perilously close to parody already.Ben Stiller, Hank Azaria (in a nifty comic performance), William H. Macy, Paul Rubens and Janeanne Garofolo comprise a group of superhero wannabes who set out on a mission to rescue the beloved (but actually conceited, jaded and image conscious) Captain Amazing, superhero extraordinaire, played by Greg Kinnear, who has been kidnapped by the evil Casanova Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush).  One truly wonders whether any of these fine actors actually read this hopeless script before signing on to the project.  The film attempts to generate its comic drive by showing how domesticated these superheroes really are.  Instead of conventional firepower, they use shovels, forks, magic bowling balls and even intensified flatulence as their weapons.  In addition, they squabble endlessly over such mundane affairs as how to divide a dinner check, fret and get their feelings hurt over who indeed is the leader of the group, and hurry back to their longsuffering wives and girlfriends before there is hell to pay on the homefront.  This pattern quickly becomes tiresome when stretched over so long a time period and Mystery Men quickly settles into that uncomfortable netherworld that traps so many parodies - that of straddling the line between honoring the conventions of the genre and debunking them at the same time.  There is an occasional witty line that manages to peep through the otherwise dull proceedings, but they are very few and far between.  And in typical '90's fashion, the finale erupts in a crescendo of overproduced special effects.  Never mind that what is happening on screen makes no sense, just as long as there are enough thundering explosions to numb the audience into insensibility.  What audience there is, that is.

Because of this the biggest hero of the town, captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear) has sold his whole appearance to promote the products of is official sponsors... a bit like the real heroes of today, the super athletes, have done eons ago.But lets get down the business shall we? The cast of the film is quite good Hank Azaria as Blue Raja, Janeane Garofalo as the Bowler, Ben Stiller as Mr. Furious. All very, at least in my opinion, capable comedians, who deliver their lines on the mark. There are lots of laughs in the film, but then again there are lots of forced moments in the film, given the 2 hour lenght so it's not a dead laughter film, more of a occasional laughs.And from there we get to the script itself, which is okay, but there is the feel, that it could have been tightened a lot better, as of now it has some unnecessary segments, which don't serve the film one way or another.The direction is okay, but some of the visual gags miss the mark but the visual quality of the movie is okay. The fight scenes are a bit shoddily made and the overall choreography could have used a bit more thought.In overall I'd say, that MM is okay film, but this rag tag hero league could have been used to make a lot better film than this.

And this sophomoric humor does sound like the same jokes he told when he was a sophomore.In fairness, I bet that most of the strained funny bits weren't his ideas but were in the basic concepts of the comic book series this is based on, such as the very funny themed gangs, especially Disco Guys and Frat Boys, as I don't remember him being particularly into comic books then. The kids in the audience laughed at every fart of course, but there were plenty of other times they weren't laughing.The leads make interesting characters. Janeane Garofalo is always fun, especially here talking to the spirit of her dead dad in a bowling ball, Ben Stiller is almost too grounded for the satire though William Macy and Hank Azaria manage to straddle the pitiful and satirical with a nice balance. The director Kinka Usher has a cameo, as does Mark Mothersbaugh who did some of the music.The art direction and costuming are absolutely terrific, like a satire of a Tim Burton movie. The camera is endlessly busy, though not enough to cover up lags such that I actually started to think about work instead. The battles are really mean, with participants really getting beat up distastefully, though Tom Waits was clear as a mad inventor that he wanted non-lethal fighting.

SPOILERS; but nothing that's a surprise, I assure you...","Date":"20 October 2002","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Fantasy","Review":"  I never want to see another live-action comic again! I'm never again going to waste my time, brain, emotions, senses, OR money ON EVEN A FREE VIDEO of one. CGI-maybe. If a comicbook hero is to be brought to the big screen, it should be presented as clearly comicbook, instead of trying to suffer real-world limitation. The mysticism of a comic is immediately undermined by live-action alone, let alone by a genre-mocking deconstruction! All comics challenge their audiences with E*N*O*R*M*O*U*S suspension of disbelief requirements; but the Mystery Men characters hinge on exposing (deconstructing) the likely banality behind superhero myths. It is what this comic originally became famous for. Unfortunately Mystery Men breaks its own genre-mocking rule when the characters do end up having some magical powers after all.  It errs on the side of mysticism, and falls on its own sword. The film's ending tries to go back to mocking the genre, but by then it's too late; we've suffered the lie (Elwood Blues would say `it wasn't lies; it was bullsh!t') for 2hrs. We know we're being ripped off. I don't call that entertainment.Because the Mystery Men cannot compartmentalize their `real-world' vs superhero personalities, we are plunged into an entire worldful of caricature `superheroes', each more pathetic than the last, with the exception of Capt. Amazing (Greg Kinnear) , who instead is a spin-doctoring, shallow celebrity now. So the Mystery Men HAVE to be so hopeless and un-heroic that any mother with a toddler in a supermarket would out-hero them any day. I do realize that's supposed to be part of their `charm', but their pointedly dumbed-down inadequacies as people are too pointed. Obviously, these imbecilic superheroes get depressed over their failures, but they don't even have enough sense to practice; so they actually deserve to fail! Consequently, their triumph is FALSE in the light of who they still are the Mystery Men, and by association their audience, are all just a pathetic bunch of weirdos. I cite Kevin Smith's insightful/ sarcastic expose of comicbook patrons in the Bluntman+Chronic scenes of the fabulous Chasing Amy (1997). You know- adolescent males.Take the very obvious clues left by the `super-powers' of the gang (I cannot BELIEVE other reviewers haven't taken to task this concept) Mr Furious is only in touch with ONE emotion; he's a petulant imbecile who thinks he should lead the group because otherwise he gets angry. Ah, what is he TWO? Maybe! He completely lacks any skills/talents, direction or wisdom way beyond the point of funny. He even has a crisis of conscience when the one girl whom he's asked out suggests he try reacquainting himself with his own name (she's somewhat smarter). The other adolescent dead giveaway is the talent of The Spleen (PeeWee Herman) for galeforce flatulence, plus his wildly overdone pimples and lithp. This is shallow, adolescent toilet humour. Moreover, the pimples and lisp look and sound really fake on such a mature-aged actor. We're embarrassed for the filmmakers, and note that the characters of Mystery Men are excessively DUMBED-DOWN. What for? Aren't we all way too experienced moviegoers to find that acceptable/entertaining? There are 5-yr olds more sophisticated (I KNOW one)!Most of these characters are overgrown children/hopeless loners, and they suck accordingly. I only like Baby Bowler (Janeane Garofalo) who, together with Mr Invisible (Kel Mitchell), are seriously verging on mental illness; but at least her asides to her bowling ball (her dad) sometimes raise a smile. She and her ball garner the movie a +2.0 rating (her name `Baby Bowler' swings, whereas `The Spleen' is just INCOMPREHENSIBLE-farts have nothing to do with spleens).Only William H Macy's `Shoveller' ever shows the slightest gumption or leadership, but even he craves superhero adulation, although he's a married man and father. Other supporting actors, such as the usually feisty Jenifer Lewis playing his wife, and Geoffrey Rush's hammy `Casanova Frankenstein', are essentially wasted. Shame.The challenge of this movie was always how to tart up a poor concept. The one ethically redeeming feature is that Mystery Men affirms everyone's right to be heard/win on occasion, including the mentally ill, the alienated, and the stupid. This gets the movie +4.5 ratings-points. But of course it's taken too far, into the realms of male ego-aggrandizement, which sets them back a  -9.0...I guess I can award Mystery Men a +1.0 for its gentility a +1.0 for its generous use of disco (and the inclusion of  `A Fifth of Beethoven' on the soundtrack).The final confrontation scene is incomprehensible and overripe with special f/x, and consequently unaffecting. Other reviewers have also complained about the inappropriateness of the spf/x, and I agree, it undermines their genre-mocking cred are the Mystery Men caricatures, or are they actual superheroes? Those options are mutually exclusive. This comic in particular, more so than any other, tries to have it both ways. Audiences notice that sort of thing, even if only subconsciously, and THAT'S WHY Mystery Men fails as a movie, as a plot, as a concept.Ethically too, it seems to celebrate the male ego's need to be a winner, no matter how stupid you are. See? Dumbed down and shallow, designed for male adolescents. No-one who is capable of more should ever be an apologist for this drivel. Ha, and for all that, the movie is too long; almost 2hrs. Isn't that ridiculous?The movie's oft-quoted style, delivered mainly with one-liners (`...apparently I'm hangin' out with Lazy Boy and... and.. The Recliner!'; `...with the mighty hammer of Not Bickering'; and `Spleen, there isn't enough beer in the world') simply doesn't excuse the movie's much more profound inadequacies. Overall a weak effort-poor concept, somewhat elevated by repartee. ...Oh, let me give it another +3.0 for the quips. But it's pointless to call Mystery Men `entertainment', because despite its still mostly annoying one-liners, Mystery Men is an embarrassing, adolescent inadequacy that bullsh!ts its audience. Where's the entertainment in that?

The concept was intriguing, yet the execution was poor.

Okay, now I know some of this is obviously not meant to be taken as high culture and that is alright, but what happened in this movie is that it is a series of sketches with little depth.  Each scene going for some crude outlandish joke that, in many cases, is just not funny at any level.  Most of the performances were decent, but the dialogue they had to utter was horrible.  May the Forks be with you is just one example of the strained comedy being pushed into the film.  Geoffrey Rush, yes the oscar winner, gives an incredibly over the top performance.  Paul Reubens gives a nice performance( nice to see someone utilizing his many talents), and Greg Kinnear probably has some of the funniest scenes as a real super hero caught up in endorsements.

It's a wonderful thing when Janeane Garofalo and Ben Stiller decide to collaborate, it's even better when they can find a solid cast to back them up. After detailed reports from the set, two lackluster trailers, and the hideous one-sheet, Mystery Men finally slumps into theaters. Universal decided to hose down my fanaticism with the worst ad campaign of the year. It's rare to come across a 70 million dollar film that the studio doesn't have a clue how to market. This is the first of many problems with Mystery Men. On to the production...The cast list is impressive Hank Azaria (one of The Simpsons brilliant voices), former Pee-Wee Paul Reubens, William H. Macy, Geoffrey Rush, Stiller and Garofalo, Wes Studi (Last Of The Mohicans), Kel Mitchell (Nickelodeon's Kenan And Kel), and personal faves Eddie Izzard (Velvet Goldmine) and Lena Olin (Romeo Is Bleeding). Not much can go wrong with this kind of talent.  I guess you can never underestimate the power of the first-time director. Kinka Usher come to us from the world of commercials and music videos, doesn't that make you shudder? Has anybody of worth come out of that background?  Maybe David Fincher, but Mr. Usher only knows two things in Mystery Men low angels and the overuse of a fish-eye lens. Almost every shot in the film alternates between the two choices. While Mystery has all the trappings of a rich comic book inspired hit, Usher buries the fun under two layers of clamor and indulgence. While they do have experience and a certain visual gumption, video helmers are slowly and effectively killing modern cinema.Ben Stiller stars as Mr. Furious, or Roy to his friends. He leads a ragtag group of low-rent superheros with powers not many would consider super. The Blue Raja (Azaria, in one of the film's inspired comic performances) hurls forks and spoons with a English accent. The Shoveler (Macy) quickly dispatches his enemies with the blunt end of a digging tool. The Spleen (Reubens, in the other great acting job) uses his flatulence to bring down evil. It's The Bowler (Garofalo) who provides the best weapon, the skull of her deceased father encased in a golden bowling ball. The group is called into action when resident Superman style hero Captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear, not as funny as he should be) comes under the evil clutches of supervillain Cassanova Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush). His intent? To take over Champion City with the help of Mini-Me and Austin's mojo... Oh, wait. I'm getting my parodies mixed up. He's up to something, maybe you can figure it out better than I could.All knocks aside, Mystery Men has it's moments. When the team is finally realized and sets out to fight evil, the film becomes this kinetic ride with lots of laughs and a great sense of parody.  Like I said, I'm a sucker for the genius of Stiller and Garofalo.  Kinka Usher ends these moments too quickly with endless scenes of preparation and little scenes developing the Cassanova character. I liked Rush quite a bit, anything but to see him in tights and spouting Elizabethan dialog, but cohort in crime Olin barely has any dialog, a crying shame. Usher can't seem to marry the story to the fun. Mystery is one of those films that's too interested in it's presentation to care much about story or keeping the silly level up. Every penny is up on-screen (especially in shots when cars drive through the same set about 3 times), but the computer effects look community-college level. Shocking in this day and age when anything is possible. The climax of the film is another disappointment. Director Usher loses control of the film and it hurdles into an orgy of noise and effects. With a nearly 120 minute running time, Men beats you senseless in it's final 25 minutes. The narrative breaks down and you find yourself covering your ears and praying the action will take a break. Save for one hilarious Six Million Dollar Man gag, the entire climax is a waste of time and money. Keeping the budget lower might have forced Usher to use his brains to end the film. Instead we get his short-attention span.I came out sorta liking Mystery Men, but I'm having trouble remembering the good parts. They had a solid in-jokey script to work with, an amazing cast that will not come around again (unless this does well), and a multi-million dollar palette from which to create a new comic book environment.  I can't entirely recommend Mystery Men, but I can say that the potential is there. That's more than most films have.----------- 5/10  "},{"Title":"So much effort for so little joy","Date":"25 December 2003","Score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Fantasy","Review":"  I've only asked for my money back on two movies.

You could tell it was spoofing superhero movies but not successfully. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. The trailer looked so promising too.  "},{"Title":"Terrible","Date":"14 January 2007","Score":"1 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Fantasy","Review":" A poorly written script. Over the top acting. Unlikeable characters. I made it through the first 15 minutes of this rubbish and then had to turn it off. The film tries to be funny but comes across as grating to the nerves. The characters are all one-dimensional caricatures that fail to win audience empathy. It's as if the writer was thinking oh if I give them all some bizarre quirk I will have produced unique and interesting characters but he instead achieves utter banality. Even in the genres of screwball comedy or parody, this film fails to deliver the goods. My advice to the writer is learn to give your characters depth and a meaningful struggle - meaning produces emotion.Totally devoid of entertainment value and a waste of a decent cast.

And finally, #1 As you watch the credits at the end of the film, somewhere within those last 6 minutes, in the reflexion of your TV screen, you see a cat on the lawn outside. I'll admit that I might have missed something even funnier, had I not watched a Cleanfilms edited version. But beware, this film just MAY be the one makes you laugh dying. "}]
