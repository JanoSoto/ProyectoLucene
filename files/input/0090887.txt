The basic plot is that little furry monsters (kind of like hairy kirbys with teeth) land from outer space and begin to eat the town they land by.  Pretty basic storyline, but this is a monster movie you know.  The Critters (or Krites, to be precise), are, while obviously puppets, very cool and well done.  The human actors on the other hand...well, they are terrible.  The dad, his shoulder and leg practically gnawed of by critters, remains alert and vigilant, even though he's covered in blood.  The boy is average, at best.  The bounty hunters are alright.  The best actor is Charlie, the drunk.  He pulls off a very good performance.Ok, so this movie won't make any headlines, or be famous.

I guess whoever was in charge figured all the kids would be asleep by the time they put this on, but I managed to stay awake and watch the lot, and Critters became a firm favourite of mine for the next few years. Despite seeing this film and the first two sequels several times as a kid, I could pretty much remember nothing about it when it came to watching it this time; and despite the fact that Critters is not quite the film I remember it being, this is still a fun little eighties crapfest with plenty to recommend it for! The plot focuses on a war in outer space that spills over onto a farm in a small mid-western town. The town unwittingly greet a meteorite, that later gives way to a host of nasty, furry little creatures with big teeth! Hot on their tails are a pair of intergalactic bounty hunters sent to track down the furballs - but the 'critters' get their first, and manage to cause quite a lot of damage before the bounty hunters eventually arrive...Critters is clearly reminiscent of the 1984 hit Gremlins, as evidenced by the basics of the plot as well as the focus on humour. The critters themselves are hilarious little creations - thick black hair and a mouth full of teeth, but in their own way they're also fairly frightening! Gremlins isn't the only influence on this film - the whole idea of something bad coming from space being followed by something to stop it obviously came from The Terminator, and there are a number of other ideas taken from elsewhere - but the film doesn't feel like a bunch of stolen ideas, and that is to it's credit. The secluded farmyard setting is also to its credit, and again, while it's not the most original location for a film like this to take place, it works well so that isn't a problem. The cast, which includes the likes of M. Emmet Walsh, Dee Wallace and Billy Zane, all do their jobs well, and the action is always exciting enough to ensure that the film remains interesting. I won't say that this is a classic of the genre - but its good fun and I certainly recommend it.

Along with Night of the Creeps and Killer Klowns from Outer Space, Critters definitely is the most successful horror-comedy of the 80's and it actually even manages to be much better than the blockbuster it obviously borrowed its ideas from, namely Joe Dante's Gremlins. The screenplay also uses story elements of innumerable other movies (the farm-setting, the space prison concept&#133;) and yet it never really directly rips off any of them, which is quite an admirable effort. Hairy little space monsters, with funky red eyes and an insatiable appetite, escape from their prison transport and land in rural Kansas where they immediately attack farmer Jay Brown's cattle and family. The son of the family tries to reach the nearby village for help, but the Critters (or Krites, as they're called in space) make it impossible to get away. Luckily enough, there also are two intergalactic bounty hunters with heavy artillery looking for the murderous furballs. The story opens a little slow with an overly extended family portrait of the Browns but, once the critters are rolling over the earth and eating their way through the countryside, Stephen Herek's film is both funny and action-packed at the same time. The dialogs are surprisingly witty and contain numerous references towards great Sci-Fi classics. Particularly the bounty hunters are hilarious, with one of them impersonating a famous rock star and the other indecisive about what appearance he wants to take on. The sharp-teethed Critters are engaging creations, made by the endlessly talented Chiodo-brothers of the aforementioned Killer Klowns&#133; The acting performances are rather forgettable. M. Emmet Walsh is underused as the town's sheriff and Dee Wallace Stone tries to look too much like a teenage scream queen. There are early roles for Billy Zane and Lin Shaye, who would only reach their popularity-peak in the 90's. Light-headed fun for the whole family!

CRITTERS was New Line's reply to GREMLINS and for my money it's the better movie. There's no question that this film was made for a rather small budget but I think it's a perfect example of how the genre can be done right without having to spend a lot of cash on special effects. The film offers up some fun homages to other films, some great characters to root for and we're also given some terrific villains who you just love to hate. I think the creatures themselves are certainly the highlight of the picture. Their design really was a work of genius in the way that they can roll to wherever they're going and the darts are just an added goodie. I really loved the way that they looked and there's no question that those teeth are priceless. While the things aren't ever scary I really don't think they need to be because this picture really isn't about being scared but it's about just having fun. It also doesn't hurt that we're given a great family to cheer for along the way. Dee Wallace Stone play the mom, Billy Green Bush the dad, Scott Grimes the son, Nadine Van Der Velde the daughter and M. Emmet Walsh plays the local Sheriff. We also have Billy Zane in a small role as a boyfriend. The performances are also extremely good here including the always reliable Dee Wallace Stone. Grimes makes for a good guy to cheer for as well. The film really doesn't contain any major violence, which wasn't the norm for the horror and sci-fi genre from this period but the creativity here really makes up for that. Director Stephen Herek really does a nice job mixing everything up and he keeps the film moving at a terrific pace.

From the Critters themselves to every other character in the film, it shouts out as a colourised version of a 50s staple.Critters escape from a space prison and head for another planet, Kansas well OK then, Earth, here they intend to eat every thing that gets in their way. The inhabitants of a small town don't know what has hit them, but aided by a couple of intergalactic bounty hunters, they fight back to hopefully rid their homes of the furry maniacal Critters.Watching this is like watching a roll call for every stereotypical character ever put into a creature feature film. Cute kid who could be a hero, nice but dim farm hand, homely family with guts and verve, the sheriff who is just not gonna believe what is happening no matter what evidence is produced, and etc. Yet it works because they are homaging past masters, they aren't trying to kid anyone that it's a new idea, it's good fun that doesn't outstay its welcome.The Critters are great, furry balls of fury with a shed load of teeth that are backed up by off the cuff subtitles to enthasize their grumblings. Genre babe Dee Wallace Stone gets to do her stuff, whilst M Emett Walsh has fun as sceptical sheriff Harv.

I have a lot to say here but before I begin I'd like to say that if you ever read a review that says this is a ripoff of Gremlins, ignore it. Not only is this film way better than Gremlins but it is definitely not a ripoff and I'll explain why. Okay, maybe they got the idea slightly from Gremlins but this is very original and the only thing the two films have in common is the little furry monsters that eat people (well the Critters do anyway, Gremlins is more of a Family movie). Just because Gremlins was made first means nothing. I guess every zombie movie is a rip off of Night of the Living Dead since it was (I think) the first. Also the Critters are from space and Gremlins doesn't even really have a back story (I'm not going into detail).With that out of the way, these are the reasons that Critters is an all time favorite of mine and always will be the actors playing the family (Billy Green Bush, Dee Wallace Stone, Nadine Van Der Velde and Scott Grimes) are fantastic and actually feel like a real family. I was blown away by their amazing performance, and that of every other actor in the film. The story is highly entertaining and very original too (nevermind the Gremlins similarities which everyone looks too hard for) and consists of eight killer fur balls (which look very real I might add) who escape an intergalactic prison, steal a ship then head to Earth for some tasty human flesh to snack on. But my favorite scenes involve a duo of shape shifting bounty hunters, who cause way more destruction than the Critters and have the whole town terrified (which is hilarious as I guess all they care about is getting their paycheck). In order to blend in, one of them transforms into a rockstar (Terrence Mann), and the other one changes into three different people including the town drunk Charlie (Don Opper who, along with Mann, stars in all of the Critters films). They show up and destroy a church and a bowling alley looking for the ferocious krites then finally find them at the house of the family in which the film centers around. You'll notice that they only kill one krite (!) and leave the whole town in shock with their pointless damage (it's still very funny). I could go on and on about this film which I love and own on DVD along with it's three sequels (which are still good but don't even compare with this entry) that star Opper, who eventually becomes the main character, and Mann, who returns as the alien bounty hunter Ug who is still in the same form for some reason. The direct-to-video third film actually isn't very good at all and the fourth film (which was filmed back to back with part three and was also released direct-to-video) is a whole lot better but just really depressing as the whole thing takes place in space in the future. I love these films which will always be some of the greatest low budget movies ever made.

This will make for a fun Friday night movie marathon. So, having never seen a single one of the Critters films, I picked up the entire collection and embarked on a journey to see just how cheesy/idiotic (after all, the so-bad-it's- good appeal is really the only thing these having going for them, right?) they really are.Here's the scoop a hostile alien species known as the Crites escapes from an intergalactic prison asteroid and executes an escape plan&#x97;the word plan is used very loosely&#x97;to hide on the planet Earth until they can make their next move. Two bounty hunters are sent after the Crites; they are ordered to bring back the razor-toothed furballs at any and all costs. Thus the stage is set for one of the great sci-fi confrontations of the past 25 years.Not.Critters seems to be savvy enough to realize that it's nothing more than moronic popcorn cinema, but it never really accomplishes any gags that truly elicits the chuckles (or scares) that were certainly intended to define this most lowbrow of offerings.If I had to pinpoint the main problem with Critters, I'd say it has to do with the uneven transition between the cartoonish antics of the extraterrestrials themselves and the oddly serious moments of violence that pop-up sporadically when things really hit the fan. One minute we see one of the malicious little creatures swallow a firecracker and momentarily stagger as the thing explodes and a thin trail of smoke pours from his mouth (it's shockingly close to what you'd seen during any given episode of Looney Tunes). The next, we watch the thing tear off hunks of flesh in an effort to consume the innocent inhabits of a rural Kansas community.As you'd expect, there are plenty of pop-culture references and hammy one-liners, but this seems like little more than a pale remake of that other critter classic of the 1980â²s&#x97;Gremlins.Sure, the movie is mildly entertaining, but how it spawned three sequels I'll never know.Stay tuned for my reviews of the other three films, which, here's hoping, will manage to strike some sort of balance in the clunky dichotomy between laughs and gore that we see in the first entry.

On Earth, the rural Brown family, Helen (Dee Wallace), Jay (Billy Green Bush), their daughter April (Nadine Van Der Velde) and son Brad (Scott Grimes), live peacefully on their farm in Kansas. The Krites (or 'Critters') arrive on Earth and wreak havoc, attacking police cars and encroaching on the Brown family's farm. The bounty hunters arrive too, witnessed by Jay and Brad, and aggressively seek out the critters, as the tiny terrors descend on the Brown's.Seemingly both pro and anti-Spielberg in nature, Critters benefits from - like so many horror films of its era and ilk - the puppet design. While the whole concept is a thinly-disguised rip-off of the vastly superior Gremlins (1984), the critters are certainly enjoyable to watch, as, unlike the gremlins, they dispose of people in variously gruesome ways with their razor-sharp teeth and their spikes (which they project like darts from their back). It's just a shame that the makers decided to crowbar in the alien bounty hunter sub-plot that not only takes the action away from the critters, but gives the film a very silly, slapstick edge that reminded me of Suburban Commando (1991).While Spielberg had set the family blockbuster groundwork with Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) and the massively successful E.T. The Extra Terrestrial (1982), depicting the wonder of alien invasion from the view of the family unit, Critters seems to be happy enough following this familiar path, but giving the film of a more violent edge (in one scene, a critter bites the head of Brad's E.T. teddy). It is these aspects that work for and against the film, giving it a warm familiarity of the line of 'kid-friendly' 80's horror/sci-fi movies, but reminded you that Spielberg did it far, far better. But at only 82 minutes, it doesn't demand much attention, but manages to be entertaining enough when it grabs it.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com "},{"Title":"They have weapons!","Date":"14 July 2011","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Horror","Review":" C+ This in all sanity is a terrible movie. It doesn't take a critic to blow the film out of the water, aiming at its acting and simplistic story. True, because of its one dimensional characters one can't fully commit to the movie. However, I love certain aspects of it which leads to my love for the film itself. Firstly, the film is purely a fun one, its purpose solely being to blend, sci-fi and comedy, as well as horror of course. The Critters themselves are fiendish little bastards and I love them. Some consider them to be a cheap knock off of Gremlins but believe it or not the originality is actually debatable, so for what it's worth discrediting the film on that notion is invalid in itself.The concept of bounty hunters coming to earth to kill monsters was pretty cool. The film slowly becomes the hyped-up sugar-driven child's lame dream come true. For that bit of nostalgia, how can I not honor it? Plus the score by is not so bad and there are even a few stars in it, like Dee Wallace-Stone and Billy Zane. I love to watch it again and again, for the sake of having a good laugh if anything.

It is preposterous in the way it builds character who we couldn't care less about dying, and yet it tries to make us identify with them. Dispensable Characters can be done well; in Halloween for example, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) was the only character you wanted to see prevail; here, the movie has hiccups of death, but to no avail. It's boring when it lacks suspense as well. The thing that gives the story any sense of real exercised life is the Critters - even them, the Creatures like in Gremlins are the ones that we can identify with - come on they're omnivores looking for a bite to eat; they are so terrible at getting it that we just wished everything was inexorable. The first kill was of a police officer who was eaten through unknown means - we know who killed him, but it was the way it was done that seemed enticing, and then we realized that this movie is not going for the route of body counts that happen in fast and furious ways (which albeit I love suspense, but the movie would have been better as a schlocky movie in that sense, and not a stale and mind numbing movie, only proving it's schlocky at suspense), but it is not even set up with natural consequences. And it's not fun when you just expect things, as opposed to evolve things.The plot involves Brad Brown (played by Scott Grimes), a kid who finds leisure time using explosive things and his slingshot. Her Sister April (Nadine Van der Velde) and she is the petulant and quarrelsome teenager who incidentally looks older than a normal teenager. Their Dad is Jay Brown (Billy Green Bush) who is a mechanic in a field. Of course, the Critters are from an extraterrestrial planet, and we just wait for it to go down to earth. Charlie McFadden is the one who can feel the subliminal signals from outer space... and he is also the one who is too timid to open himself up. Eventually a UFO crash into their field, but it doesn't just crash It steadily and lethargically move towards it. April is in the barn with her Boyfriend, about to fornicate, and Brad is grounded and unable to watch movies for 2 weeks (god, if it meant these movies I would be fine, apart from that it would be torture!). When the creatures come down, they spark a ruckus and then everything ensues respectively and boringly, without any sense of caring.This movie counterpoises your interest in the sense that it doesn't even replenish your enjoyment; scenes where the Critters play around in their house is just an example of this movie not being serious. Yet the undercurrent that becomes the problem is that it isn't thrilling and it is really stupid. I mean stupid because the Critter eats a bomb, showing us that he really is carnivorous, implodes and then other Critters inexplicably come out of nowhere. Then you have the ones that take Human Flesh that throws a bowling ball with full strength and it knocks out the bowling balls; I don't know why but for some reason these bits felt languidly boring, off setting and I think this destroys the atmosphere of the film. It has an atmosphere of a post-tragedy film, but it lacks the humor of typical horror films, and it has one- dimensional characters and odious critters. What else can I say? ... I don't recommend this movie. Not even to Hardcore Horror Fans because this movie doesn't even pervade a disturbing, satirical or lively quality; it is languid, boring, uninteresting and predictably long-winded and for this I give it a 1 for Awful!

Sounds like a winning combination to me! The movie is fairly light hearted, putting laughs over scares or logical progression. There were times when I saw the window wide open to do some very dark humor, and I was slightly disappointed that they didn't take those opportunities. The main family members do decay as the movie progresses, as I felt the sister and the father were stronger characters before the plot showed up, and I blame the plot for that. CActing I was excited to see Billy Zane's name in the credits considering I'm a big fan of his work. Sadly, he has a somewhat small role as the 80's dumb boyfriend. At least he does it well. The star of this movie is the kid, played by Scott Grimes, who plays a very confident little crazy-prepared pyromaniac. Outside of the horror genre this kid would probably be seeing a psychiatrist on a regular basis, but it works here. Don Keith Opper annoyed me, which is probably a bad thing considering he's in all four of these movies and since I've started down this path I'll have to watch them all. Overall, the acting department gets a B.Direction This has the feel of a children's movie, a little cheesy but with a punch to it. The direction neither offended me nor impressed me, and I'm searching for things to say about it. That sounds like C level to me.Visuals The visuals still work to this day, which I consider to be a high compliment to an 80's special effects movie. The critters have a great combination of cute, yet menacing (I won't say scary, but slightly intimidating). The space ships look cool and the two bounty hunters are a visual highlight of this movie. A Overall Critters is a fun entry into the silly horror genre that I think most kids would be all over and most parents would enjoy with the proper mindset. It's fairly safe, its got some dry humping but no nudity or real sex, some blood but not obscene amounts, and I don't recall any major profanity being dropped. The only real setback for parents would be the need to explain to their children that it is not okay to make bombs in the barn, despite the fact that it worked out for the kid in this movie.

Critters is one of these examples. Critters is not only good, but exceptionally amazing when you would not be expecting that from such a film. The movie is excellently played out with amazing aspects and attributes that make it a fun, instantly enjoyable and totally rewatchable gem that I am glad to say I have enjoyed for many years and will enjoy for many years to come.The performances, while some are questionably mediocre, are all very likable and pertain to the film quite well. The main lead, whose name escapes me, did a very good job in this and the sequel, as did Dee Wallace who was a great horror star of the 80s, and the cameo by a young Billy Zane is just as enjoyable as all the other performances. The story, while could be greatly criticized by many people, I thought was stupendous. The critters look fabulous and are very threatening and cool, while at the same time as being laughable and cute, yes, I said cute. Their qualities give them a sudden likability, even though they are the villains, and the bounty hunters, while probably my least favorite thing about the movie, pass the time and fill some space well.It is very entertaining in the utmost sense with some nice kills, thrills and well, not really any chills, but I have nothing else that rhymes. While it is not a masterpiece, I greatly enjoy it as one of my all time favorite B-movies and honorably own it and it's two following sequels.

Though this time it is not a mass of goo, it is little razor-teethed fuzzballs (think Furrbies with rabies) who have escaped from a galactic prison, and ended up landing on Earth, and these little Critters are hungry!The Krites (aka Critters) terrorise a family out in rural Kansas, and are pursued by shape-shifting bounty hunters, one with a ferocious mullet, who resemble a travelling comedy duo with leaf-blowers. While bounty hunting the Krites they only succeed for the most part in terrorising the townsfolk...these scenes are bizarre, especially the trigger happy bounty hunter who cant seem to decide on a shape to shift into. But anyway, these fairly inept space hooligans end up teaming up with Scott Grimes, in one of his first roles(great as the kid fighting the Critters with some help from his big sis, Dad and ET's Mum) and suffice it to say they make short work of the Krites with much explosive goodness! They also demonstrate their magic powers when they reconstruct the family home (obliterated in the Krite-battle)...hmmm i wonder if they bothered to do the same with the church and bowling alley they destroyed!The performances are definitely good for this kind of B movie, the scenes of Scott Grimes' character fighting with his big sister will ring true to anyone who has shared that relationship...very real!This movie is cool, no-brainer fun for a Saturday night. The story is exciting, and though it bears a resemblance to Gremlins you can hardly call this a rip-off of that film, and although I love Joe Dante's work, I like this film better than Gremlins anyway. Some great lines too...the bounty hunters' dialogue consists mainly of We're here for the Krites. and Where are the Krites?

The worst thing ever to happen in Grover's Bend is the local drunk (the ever lovable Charlie) getting chucked out of a bar. But now the Krites are here and they lay siege to the Brown farm, eating their cows, Billy Zane, chickens etc. Anyone or anything getting in their way is promptly poisoned by their anaesthetic spikes and feasted on.Once the bounty hunters arrive the almost do more harm than good. The bulk of the laughs come from this, including a running joke on how one of them has shape-shifted into the form of an '80s heavy metal rocker. The other can't make up his mind and constantly changes into various townsfolk.The Critters (8 small ones and a big shaggy one) may be Gremlins clones but there's no denying their cuteness.

The script by Herek, Domonic Muir with 'additional scenes' by Don Keith Opper as Don Opper who also stars in the film as Charlie McFadden, is well paced & isn't boring & thankfully doesn't seem to take itself too seriously. It's a little on the clichÃ©d side, a bratty teenager saving the day, the sequel orientated ending, characters stranded in an isolated location under threat from monster/alien with no way of contacting the outside world & the standard cardboard cut out disposable characters who end up eaten, but Herek keeps things moving along at a nice pace & it isn't a huge problem here. The Crites themselves are pretty cool & the special effects surprisingly good throughout even if the giant Crite at the end is severely underused. I was particularly impressed with the optical effects, including the spaceships & view of earth from space among others considering the year Critters was made & the obvious budget restrictions. There isn't a whole lot of gore but that didn't seem to matter much as the film as a whole is solid, someone has their fingers bitten off & there are a few bite wounds but that's about it.

What really gives this one a lot of enjoyment is the rather fun way this one manages to feature their cheesy nature despite still maintaining a strong sense of horror throughout here. While their very nature of being miniature hairy-reptilian beings obviously being small puppets, there's some great fun to be had as the creatures' goofy antics and behavior allows for plenty of comedy where they'll decidedly act like simplistic out-of-their-element and instead are keeping their natural instincts alive where they just go after anything and everything in their path with a vicious appetite that goes along with their discussions with each other. That makes for a great contrast to their threat here as they are kept as formidable as possible within this setting so their leaping emergence from the shadows in the basement, the first attack on the couple in the barn and cutting off the family's escape attempt all manage to feature a rather enjoyable sense of fear from the proceedings that makes them so enjoyable. With the escape attempt also leading into the fun barricade-measures to try to keep them at bay being a truly enjoyable series of action scenes that get incredibly fun while also containing their goofy antics throughout and setting up the big finale involved here. The science-fiction elements present throughout this part of the film, from the introduction of the aliens and the shape-shifting bounty hunters with their powerful laser weapons introduced here also manages to work nicely here by giving this one some extra action with the aliens' attack on the house clearing out the creatures and the finishing touch in the ship as it departs which is all in good fun as this manages to mix in the action with the sci-fi elements for an overall great part to this as well. With the great creature design and no real drag here from the pacing keeping this one moving along smoothly, it has a lot to like here that holds up over the film's one apparent and obvious flaw. The fact that this one is so goofy and cheesy might make it quite a chore for some who aren't that interested in this kind of schlocky effort. While there's certainly every effort made here to point out that's the case here with the plot and general atmosphere here, even this at times ventures too far into straight cheese which might be somewhat challenging. Otherwise, there's little stopping this one from being as fun as it is.Rated PG-13 Language and Violence.

There is no real accounting for why one likes a movie that others despise, or vice versa. Often, one's personal taste is the result of accumulated life experience, which cultivate that person's view. I find it interesting, then, how that taste can change. At times, a beloved treasure from childhood will forever stay that way and even starts to inform our later tastes. No matter how much critical review would tell me that CHILDREN OF THE CORN is not really that great a movie, I love it. It scared the holy hell out of me as a child and it has always stuck with me as an effective horror movie, no matter how much others may bash it. Then, there is the complete opposite effect, when we revisit a movie we loved as a child and realize my god, this is really bad. I recently had that experience with CRITTERS. This was a movie that had everything I wanted as a child. We had Dee Wallace, the perfect 80s mom for whom I held a secret crush. There were funny little monsters that swore and murdered people. There was violence, horror, comedy and the hint of sex. Finally, we had kick-ass bounty hunters, complete with 80s rock star hair-dos. It was the perfect cocktail of my childhood obsessions. It certainly helped that it became regular fare on 80s cable, allowing me to see it repeatedly.I would guess that it's been 25 or 30 years since I last saw the movie. Over the past year, I have met several of its' actors at horror conventions, which led to me pulling this 80s gem out of the cellar and giving it another spin in the DVD player. I was hoping for a nostalgic romp through a fun 80s horror flick, but I couldn't stop seeing the cracks in the foundation, eventually resorting to mocking parts of it MST3K style with my wife. Everything that I loved about it lost its' shine in those intervening decades. Most of all was the Critters, themselves. The effects are really bad. I can tolerate 80s practical efx cheesiness and, in fact, want it more in today's horror. I watch a lot of garbage horror, but these monsters are bad puppets, with bad animation. There is little fluidity in their movement. I am keeping the age of the effects in mind, along with the budget, but they are one step above being puppets on strings. All of the laughs I seemed to remember as a kid are gone, despite a few bad attempts at one-liners. The bounty hunters are even worse. I get that they are supposed to be wooden but they really take it to an extreme. Terrance Mann was so cool to me, then. Now, he's a bad actor, with a bad haircut, who sings a horrible 80s arena rock song in a video to start the movie, and as a bounty hunter just deadpans his way through it.I recognize that I am probably being far too harsh on a movie that was meant to be fun. It was low budget. It was a recognized ripoff of GREMLINS and THE TERMINATOR and E.T. and a few other 80s movies to boot. I should not be judging this movie on the same scale as, say, THE SHINING, and I don't think that I am. As I've said, I love all kinds of horror and can get behind bad horror. That's exactly all this is, though. It's the kind of movie that is beloved by a few geeks (said in the most loving way) who frequent comic cons and horror conventions and have fond childhood memories of this one. To anyone else, though, this is just going to end up playing out like a string of bad 80s clichÃ©s. "},{"Title":"VERY good.

Even if you've never seen it, but love the 80s horror movies, you might like this little gem.* * * Final thoughts I know they were trying to tap into Gremlins success, just like every other 80s horror film was a copycat, but at least this movie tried to shake things up a bit with the background story.

The critters are sought after by melty faced bounty hunters who can take any form they choose.

Anyways, the critters focus their attack on a little farm house, and the family boards up inside and try to survive the attack. That's basically all of the plot. The critters or krytes as they're refereed to as by the bounty hunters, are really fun to watch. Whenever they speak, we get subtitles, which is fun to see. Critters spawned several sequels, but this is by far the best. Unfortanately, it lives in the shadow of gremlins, and some even believe it to be a rip off of gremlins. However the film actually went into production before the gremlins movie was even released, and had to undergo re-writes so the two films didn't seem so similar.

Yes, it is proved that it's not usually possible to come up with a marvelous idea about a monster movie, but the makers of Critters shouldn't have expected such a great critic reception.

Surely, said I, Critters has been cancelled and someone has put on an extended edition episode of the Waltons instead. Well a very short time later, I discovered that I did indeed have the right channel and man was I ever glad, because once the warm, character-building early scenes are out the way and the Critters turn up the boundless, over the top carnage becomes breath taking. The sight of these mangy little fur-balls rampaging through the countryside spitting out one-liners and eating people is fun enough, but when two interstellar bounty hunters with a phenomenal amount of firepower to their credit turn up to stop them, the mayhem never stops.In a nutshell, this is trash film making of the highest quality. There's very little horror to be had at all, but if you're of the opinion that a great movie needs a lot of blood, a lot of explosions and a keen sense of fun, it makes for a riotous night in. And it's also worth catching just to see a very young Scott Grimes from out of Band of Brothers during his spotty teenage years doing all the things malcontent boys do; argue with their sisters, try to fake illness to get off school and battle vicious flesh-eating alien monsters.

The creatures land in a farming field, first feeding on cattle, chickens, firecrackers, pitchfork ends & car seats, before deciding they would rather their meals be human & start to attack those unfortunate enough to be in their path & then begin terrorizing the Brown family, a typical farming family living in a small town, biting them with their razor sharp teeth & then shooting poisonous porcupine like quilts from their backs, in order to weaken them. Arriving on earth, one of the alien bounty hunters named UG, takes the form of a 1980's rock n' roll superstar named Johnny Steele (TERRANCE MANN) while the other named LEE (UG LEE, get it!) cannot find a suitable human look from any of the TV programs he has seen on their trip there. While on earth, however all of this soon changes as he finds plenty of human forms to hide his true face, as he frequently changes faces, first with a dead cop that fell prey to the Critters, then a minister & finally the town drunk Charlie McFadden (DON OPPER). Where plenty of humour arises mainly to the alien bounty hunters indifference to a world inhabited by humans & not aliens & begin to shoot up the place in a search for the creatures. Director STEPHEN HEREK fares well behind the camera, working with a script written by the late DOMINIC MUIR, & the two have managed to fashion a good old fashioned monster B movie, similarly akin to that of the 1950's & 60's monster B movie cheapies, only updated for modern times with better contemporary rock music & effects & a dose of comedy very closely akin to GREMLINS, whose success inspired this movie & many other mini monster movies of the era. The acting is really good, the critter designs, alien bounty hunter make-up & other alien creature make-up is very well done & superb, as is the model ships & set designs & explosions, all nicely designed & caught on film despite the fact that the film was working on a clearly low budget. Director Herek has chosen to keep his menacing monsters off screen for the first half of the film & instead focuses on POV'S from the creatures as they stalk their intended prey, until they are revealed on screen about midway. The films comedy is funny when it needs to be & suspenseful when the action kicks in. TITANIC's own BILLY ZANE stars in an early role as the farming family daughter's rich boyfriend, who visits the family farm & then becomes lunch for the carnivores, one of said creatures which grows bigger & bigger as the film goes on, to a monstrous size creature with a hunger to match. DEE WALLACE STONE plays the mother of the family quiet well, in fact there's even an in joke scene in the film that sees one of the Critters asking an E.T. stuffed animal who he is, before chewing his head off (Stone played the mom of the children in that film) The only confusion I have is in the following (& as far as I know, no one has ever picked up on this yet) at the beginning of the film, the kids are eating breakfast & are getting ready for school, & yet when the alien bounty hunters arrive on earth later that night, the hunters interrupt a church service in town (do churches hold church services during the week as well as on Sundays?) All in all, CRITTERS never tires with age, in fact it just gets better & is a perfect mini monster movie & the best GREMLINS rip-off you can find (Is it okay to say that I prefer this film to that one?) sadly the film didn't do as well in theatres as it did on home video.

Though Critters isn't an all out 'horror' film, it carries the fine line between Sci-Fi-Horror affair much like Alien.The difference between Critters and Gremlins are subtle, but enough to make this a worthy picture for mass concumption.  Gremlins was intended to be a comedy, but fell on the fine line with it's realistic violence.  This ofcourse was helped though by the films sequal Gremlins 2 The New Batch, but Critters is more strait forward sci-fi, without trying to cuddle you in. The story is pretty basic, you could run the first 10-15 minutes of Wizard of Oz and then splice into Critters where the action begins, and you really wouldn't notice much of a difference other than Dorothy gets much older real fast, and one of the Lolly Pop Guild is our protaganist.The Brown family, a farm family outside of a small town in Kansas is invaded by small Popple like creatures from outer space that escaped from a prison hold on the other end of the galaxy.  The Krites as they are called by the bounty hunters that follow them, begin to feed and grow on cops, cattle, and unsuspecting boyfriends. This low budget romp is fun, and funny, I think that the bluntness with the gore and sci-fi/horror atmosphere makes this stand apart from Gremlins, but let's all face it, the pitch for the movie was Gremlins meets Alien! Scott Grimes plays our young hero by the name of Brad.  Don Opper plays his friend, and father's employee Charlie, whom part isn't as large here as it is in the sequals, other than the crazy guy running around warning everybody, ala' Friday the 13th, and so on.

I remember seeing Critters in the theater when I was about 12 and a the time, I was blown away by it. The movie is about a handful of critters (little creatures that resemble gremlins in personality) who escape from a prison spaceship and crash-land on earth, where they terrorize a family living on a farm. Meanwhile, two bounty hunters are sent from outer space to dispose of the critters. The critters themselves are hairy, ugly little creatures with very sharp teeth. They can curl into the shape of a ball and roll around. They shoot poisonous darts and eat anything that moves - they are much meaner than gremlins and it only takes one to eat somebody alive.After watching this movie for the first time in years, some of the flaws stand out a little more. The acting (except for the mom) is definitely of B-movie quality. Also, the overuse of the Power of the Night video might irritate somebody who hates anything that's 80's .. this movie is definitely vintage mid-80's. If you happen to like the 80's, you will probably enjoy the soundtrack.Despite the flaws this is definitely much better than your average cheesy sci-fi/horror flick. The movie starts off kind of slow but once the critters land on earth (about 20 minutes into the movie) and eat a couple of people, the action is almost non-stop and very rarely lets up. There are a lot of tense and scary moments in this movie and the critters are just ... well, MEAN! If you liked Gremlins, you'll almost definitely like this. However, if you're looking for a gorefest, you will not find it here. This movie is more on the comedic side (in the spirit of Gremlins) than it is a true horror flick, but it's still very good.Oh, and a word about the sequels. There are 4 parts to this series, with each sequel being progressively worse than the last. If you liked this one, you should probably watch Critters 2, as it is watchable and somewhat enjoyable, but nowhere near as good as the first.

The worst however is the ending, the premise that firecracker, which little boy carries around with him, can blow up the most advanced alien spacecraft in galaxy is beyond stupid and convenient, it's dumb even by movie logics, because earlier it was clearly established, that it couldn't even blow up a single critter, who swallowed the thing.

The story itself is fast paced, never stalls or gets boring but neither does it get too fast. The ending is not the best so to speak but it passes as ok. I wanna draw a parallel to Halloween (I) which I saw a few days ago too I can enjoy slasher movies and expected a lot from Halloween but after about an hour (when the action was slowly starting) I started to fast forward through it - the reason being that the movie had already lost me, eventho it is certainly better made (not hard when you think of that it needs less special effects) than Critters and also has a more serious story that could almost pass as real. The difference here tho was that Halloween didn't get on with it, it seemed to me like a one hour brake before it really took off. Critter tho got me from the beginning and held my attention throughout because you got to the people it was about and the actors were good at describing the family, so my attention had always something to hold on to.

Never before have I beared witness to such destructiveforces of nature.This documentary is basically an emotional rollar-coaster. Werecommend it for those who are willing to watch a piece that themain-stream press is (still) afraid to cover.  It is chilling, especiallywhen I think of how frightened the camera man must've been ashe watched these hideous and demented creatures commitdisgusting acts of mayheam and debauchery.  I (unlike thecorporate news-shows) commend him on this film.Mainly this work reminded me of a similar cinematic masterpiececalled The Crow.  Both Eric and the critters (in general) havemade a profound impact at my life.  Last summer was a time of intense spiritual turmoil for me.  Butwith the help of these filmic marvels, I found numerous (and oftencontradictory ) answers to  many profound issues; not to mentionphilosophical guidance.  The things that at I learned are tooplentifull to list in this review.  Suffice it to say that there are many,many, many hidden numerical messages in this documentary. Keep your eyes peeled.   Incidentally, watch for the  scene with the eels.

The film moves between  horror and comedy. The galactic bounty hunters who are sent to destroy the Critters(escaped criminals from a prison asteroid)are played deadpan which adds to the humour.  The bounty hunters are over zealous when it comes to the use of their weapons and the shoot up of a bowling alley is a nice touch. The local drunkard Charlie is the kind of stock character that appears in comedy westerns of the John Wayne variety and is well transposed to the modern day. The long coats worn by the bounty hunters is reminiscent of those worn in Once Upon a Time in the West.I would certainly give this film 8 out of 10.

There are some really funny moments within this top shelf sci-fi film, but to know what happens rent it out (cliche).

It makes the movie fun and definitely entertaining to watch, from basically start till finish. But it also is a movie that has very little to offer. It of course is being far from original, for a comedy it perhaps isn't quite funny enough and for a horror/science-fiction it just isn't serious- and good enough all. It's the sort of movie you can easily do without but when you still decide to watch it you will have a good time nevertheless.It's the first movie that got directed by Stephen Herek, a director who once started out as a promising director but has pretty much hit rock bottom by now and directs only straight to DVD stuff for the last couple of years now.The movie also stars some young actors that are quite well known by now, like Scott Grimes and Billy Zane. All of the actors did a pretty good job by not taking their jobs so seriously in this movie. Especially Dee Wallace pretty much nailed the performance right as naive housewife.All in all not a real great genre movie but through it's deliberate silliness the movie becomes a real enjoyable one to watch.6/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"decent","Date":"3 January 2004","Score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Horror","Review":"  decent little flick is fun and entertaining that is fairly well written and acted but it has a silly ending and a dull first 30 minutes but after that this is an enjoyable flick that i recommend at any time Billy Zane has a bit part in this so look for him **1/2 out of 5 "},{"Title":"Oh my God.","Date":"9 March 2013","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Horror","Review":" My son asked me sit through this truly awful film and I wish I hadn't.

The perfect Hollywood family.  And gawd, they are dumb.The fuzzy-wuzzies look so precious that you'd just want to take one home with ya.  I do, anyway.  It might keep the cats away.  (laughs)And the alien bounty hunters that are sent after the escaped furballs are even dumber than the farm family.  It's a wonder they are able to go into outer space let alone drive a car.  Isn't there a film called MORONS FROM OUTER SPACE?  They'd be good in that one.Some cool reverse action photography involving the reconstruction of the farmhouse (at the end) looked pretty good, but that's all I can really say positive about it.There's no gore (this is a PG-13 film) so don't look for too many adult themes in this one, however I can't really see parents taking their little kids to see it, either.  And teenagers would be too jaded and sophisticated for it so I don't know who the viewing audience would be.  Besides me. (laughs)The New Line DVD has no extras in it beyond trailers for the endless sequels that Hollywood horror masturbates over.  I suspect they're more boring than this one.With M. Emmet Walsh as the dumb sheriff and Billy Zane as the airhead boyfriend.3 out of 10 "},{"Title":"1986 was a simple time.","Date":"7 June 2003","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Horror","Review":"  In the mid-80s, Stephen Herek had a dream.  It involved carnivorous oven mitts upholstered with shag carpeting.  And it was good.  (Well, not so much good as ill-advised.)As with the best visionary science-fiction, Critters is firmly entrenched in time.  When the Power of the Night music video kicks in, we are unmistakably mired in the mid-1980s.  (Why make a film that could happen any place at any time?  Make it specific so everything holds up well in the coming decades...)Confirmation of that fact arrives in the form of Billy Zane's state-of-the-art car.  The pinnacle of 1986 automotive engineering inspires awe in the Hillbillyville townsfolk. But if that car exists today, it is a rusted shell of its former self, driven by a guy named Zeke and adorned with a long-faded Spuds Mackenzie bumper sticker.Of the Critters themselves, I can only speculate that it took some serious substance abuse to think tribbles with teeth would make a good horror film.  You may appreciate the nuance of subtitling the alien language, especially when they use profanity or make a bad pun.  Then again, you may not.  Okay, so there's no chance you'll appreciate it.Can anyone explain how one Critter grew, while the others stayed the same size?  Why didn't the others grow?  Was there only enough money for a single man-sized Critter costume?  There was no rhyme or reason to this plot device, except to say, Hey, Mr. Viewer stick this in your pipe and smoke it.And to the bounty hunters (the dear, sweet, misguided bounty hunters) I say, Kudos.  I don't know why I say that, but since they shoot anything and everything at random, it's probably based in the fear that they could come for me.As far as I can tell, there's no reason for this film to exist.  Maybe I'm just not thinking hard enough.

These furry extraterrestrial beasties escaped imprisonment by stealing a spaceship off the asteroid prison they were being sent to and heading to earth. Enter the two doppelganger bounty hunters whose job is to seek and destroy, more the latter of course. And finally, we have the run-of-the-mill farm family (the father from when work used to be hard, the caring mother, the teenybopper daughter, and the mischievous son) whose land these critters decide to inhabit and terrorize. Combine this all with a small, silly police team and some backwards townsfolk, and you have a cheesy, horror-lite 80's flick.The movie is not completely horrible but will really only appeal to those who have an emotional attachment from watching it years ago or people who enjoy any,.well,.cheesy, horror-lite 80's flicks. Critters has no cool style or special qualities like similar films of this decade and, as far as I'm concerned, is really only worth one viewing, if that. The script is absurd and the humor is weak, both of which account for the relatively empty feeling at the end. Still, between some bits of action, we have a bunch of characters that, while not deep at all, are easy enough to watch. And the Crites themselves are a little amusing, I guess. Basically, it's just a simple, slightly fun yet easily forgettable horror comedy.Bonus Check out the alternate ending on the DVD by highlighting the menu critter's eyes.  What a thrill!

It was bad enough that the cold war was still on when any moment WW3 could have broken out , but to have crap music , crap hairstyles and crap fashion is just too much . Maybe it wouldn`t have been so bad if someone had dropped the bomb because then we`d be back to the stone age with better hairstyles , better clothes and - with the exception of Matt Johnson and U2 - cavemen could make better tunes than anyone in 1986***** SPOILERS *****As everyone has said CRITTERS is more or less a reworking of GREMLINS . This is something else almost unique to the period when someone comes up with a hit movie then we get a tidal wave of movies apeing the original`s style . Yeah I know it still happens today but it`s slightly less obvious now . In fact CRITTERS is a rip off from GREMLINS and THE TERMINATOR with the scene where the bounty hunters walk into the diner and start blasting away , I could have sworn I heard  I`ll be back  . And am I alone in hating the scene where Steve ( Billy Zane - Yes that one ) is attacked by the critters and April and her brother run out of the barn leaving him to his fate ? Hopefully April will never get another boyfriend ever again if that`s how she treats her datesSorry , I think I`m taking this film far too serious  "}]
